"Count Roumovski seemed quite unconcerned, but Miss Rawson shrank back into her corner, a new fear in her heart.","With all her simplicity, she looked no fool or weakling.",A clock struck twelve.,"""I refuse to have the woman I have decided to marry snatched from me by any of your sophistries,"" he said breathlessly.","And since he would be presented with all respectable ceremony at the English Embassy the following night, it could not matter a bit--and if it did--!","Eustace Medlicott, when the stains of travel had been removed from his thin person, came down to tea in the hall of the Grand Hotel with a distinct misgiving in his heart.","""You may, when you are alone, again think that it is heartless to go quite contrary to your relations like this, because they have brought you up, but remember that marriage is an act which can mean almost life or death to a woman, and that no human beings have any right to coerce you in this matter.",But even this comforting thought could not quite calm him--there remained disquieting recollections of certain forcible arguments he had been obliged to listen to against his will which had hit some part of his inner consciousness usually impregnably protected by his self-conceit.,She got up and took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her dress.,"""I refuse to listen to another word,"" Mr. Medlicott flashed, ""and I warn you, sir, that I will give no such freedom at your bidding--on the contrary, I shall have my marriage with Miss Rawson solemnized immediately, and try, if there is a word of truth in your preposterous assertion that she loves you, to bring her back to a proper sense of her duty to me and to God, repressing her earthly longings by discipline and self-denial, the only true methods for the saving of her soul.","""Good morning, mademoiselle,"" he said gravely.","They were all Italians, and took no notice of the Russian and his lady.","And as she finished reading, Stella got up and told Martha to prepare her things.","It had no beginning or date, and was just a few lines.",Here his thoughts were brought up with violent suddenness.,"So there was nothing more to be said, and Stella, looking rather pale, presently came down the steps from the corridor where their lift was situated, and joined the group in the far corner of the large hall.","He wished the stranger to put down the Times, which he wanted himself--or, at all events, remove his long legs and hidden body from such a near proximity to his niece; they could not say a word that he could not overhear, Canon Ebley mused.","They had turned into the Corso by now, and, as ever, it appeared as though it were a holiday, so thronged with pedestrians was the whole thoroughfare.","They are a million to one that anyone could recognize you in that veil and that cloak; believe me, although I am not of your country, I am at least a gentleman, and would not have persuaded you to come if there had been any danger of complications for you.""",Her heart was thumping so with excitement she could not have spoken for a moment.,Mrs. Ebley was petrified with anger and astonishment.,But it was evident they were dealing with a clever and dangerous character and Stella must be rescued from such a person's influence and married off to her lawful fiance at once.,"""I think it is quite dreadful,"" Mrs. Ebley sniffed, ""and I hear from Martha that he has no less than two valets, and a suite of princely rooms and motor cars, and the whole passage on the second floor is filled with his trunks.""","said that gentleman to his wife, ""I have not my glasses with me, I came down in such a hurry.","I have observed the whole situation, and judged of the character of your fiance.",He got in with his usual air of being unaware that he was not alone--though Stella could feel that he was touching her hand--perhaps unconsciously.,"You can be drawn in any adverse way if you do.""","He walked about the room once or twice, and at last paused in front of her.","They made the pretense of taking some refreshment at the buffet, and then went toward the open doors of the garden.","The whole thing must be the ravings of a madman, nothing more, and Stella herself would be the first to explain that point on the morrow.","The museum was so near, a mere hundred yards, there could be no impropriety in their niece's going there with Martha, even in an exhibition year in Rome.","It was not long before Miss Rawson was ready, wrapped in the long gray cloak she had worn before, and with the veil tied over her hat, and was descending in the lift alone with Ivan--her lover having gone on by the stairs.","As Stella walked to the lift with a tumultuously beating heart, she asked herself what all this could possibly mean, and why she was not angry--and why this stranger--whose appearance outraged all her ideas as to what an English gentleman should look like--had yet the power to fascinate her completely.","""Mrs. Ebley said I was to have no conversation with you, Miss,"" Martha said, glumly, at which Stella laughed afresh.","""We are all masters of our own lives, you know, once we have ceased to be children--it is only convention which persuades us to submit to others' authority.""","You are here with me--for the next hour--shall we not try to be happy?""","""The whole thing is disgraceful,"" he said, ""and I shall inform Miss Rawson's uncle and aunt of your highly insulting words to me, that they may guard her from further importunity upon your part.","""I know I never have loved him; it was only because I thought it would please you and Uncle Erasmus that I ever became engaged to him, and now that I know what love is--I mean now that the time is getting nearer, I feel that I cannot go through with it.""",Eustace evidently had discovered further cause of resentment and feminine curiosity assisted her to dress with greater rapidity than usual.,Stella sat silent; she was overcome with the whole situation; and her fiance grew more distasteful to her every moment--how had she ever been persuaded to be engaged to such a person!--while the attraction of the strange-looking Russian seemed to increase.,"""I do wonder what has come over everybody.","asked Mr. Medlicott, tapping his foot uneasily.","He lives in the greatest luxury, Eustace,"" she continued, turning to the Rev.","He must be a good deal interested in her, then; and feeling sure of this, womanlike, she immediately took advantage of it to insist upon leaving him.","At this instant he raised the paper, and appeared again the stranger almost entirely hidden from view.","""You cannot deceive me.","If it were not so, it would have been possible for the spiritually minded, of which company you infer yourself to be, to live with a woman on terms of brother and sister, and never let the senses speak at all.","""Nor I either,"" Mr. Medlicott returned, and at that moment the Aunt Caroline entered the room and gradually disclosed the awful truth she had arrived at from Miss Rawson's admissions.","""That sounds like a paradox,"" said Stella.","His usually calm blue eyes were blazing with some emotion which disturbed her greatly, she knew not why, and his voice seemed to have taken a tone of extra deepness, as he said: ""Stella!",Oh!,"But when Stella had entered the Ludovici collection she perceived him to the right, gazing at the statue of the beautiful Mars.","I never permit myself to be bored for an instant.""","She was going to freedom and love-away from Exminster and dreary duties--away from Eustace Medlicott, for ever!",Miss Rawson said.,They were silent for a moment after this.,"""Since we are coming to warnings,"" he said, ""we drop the velvet glove.","I almost feel I detest him.""","Full of tenderness and encouragement, it made her feel as bold as a young lioness and ready to brave any attack.","She longed to be convinced, and yet some altruistic sentiment made her feel still some qualms and misgivings.","I remain, sir, Yours truly.","""You are talking pure nonsense, sir,"" returned Count Roumovski sternly.","""I have informed Canon and Mrs. Ebley of your disgraceful conduct and that is sufficient.","""Of course I ought not to,"" she murmured.","was all Mrs. Ebley could say, and prepared to return to her room.",Years of rebellion at the boredom of her existence seemed to be urging her on.,All these charms tend to create in man a passionate physical love.,Stella almost said aloud.,"The great beauty of the Borghese Gardens was at its height at the end of the day, the nightingales throbbed from the bushes, and the air was full of the fresh, exquisite scents of the late spring, as the day grew toward evening and all nature seemed full of beauty and peace.","""Whatever mood you are in, you connect yourself with the cosmic current of that mood--you become in touch, so to speak, with all the other people who are under its dominion, and so it gains strength because unity is strength.","""You will have to learn more humbleness of mind, my dear child,"" he retorted sternly.","Admitted that He did--have you, then, or anyone else, the right to crush out the result of His endowment in a woman; crush her joy of them, force her into a life where their possession is looked upon as a temptation?","""It will be impossible for us to remain here,"" he continued, ""because it may be that your relations, aided by the Embassy, will have traced us before then, and if they should come upon us alone together, nothing that I could say or prove could keep the situation from looking compromising,""--he now spoke with his old calm, and Stella felt her confidence reviving.",It is only for your sake and for honor and our future happiness that I restrain myself now.,"Eustace's train would get in at about five o'clock, and he would accompany them to the Embassy.","As the Ebley party had only arrived three days ago in the city, it was clearly impossible that the affair could have gone far, and as he had heard of their sightseeing and knew Mrs. Ebley would be extremely unlikely to allow Stella out of her sight in any case, he could not imagine how his fiancee and the Russian could have found a chance to speak--and even a foreigner could not persuade a woman into this course of action in half an hour's talk at the Embassy!","She thought she ought to talk no longer to this stranger, and half rose from her seat.","""Yes,"" agreed Stella, and suddenly looked down.","The small room was empty but for the two, and he addressed her as he removed his hat.",How agreeable it must be to have well-trained servants to do one's bidding like that!,Count Roumovski asked.,"""I always know what I want and what is worth while.","Martha had been Mrs. Ebley's maid for twenty-five years, and as Stella well knew was fairly accurate in her recounting of the information she picked up."
