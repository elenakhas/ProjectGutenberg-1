"""They built a spaceship, is the long and the short of it,"" Darquelnoy answered.","They have all sorts of military secrecy, of course, and so you never know a thing is going to happen until it does.""",demanded Ebor.,"At Ebor's entrance he raised a limp tentacle in weary greeting and said, ""Come in, my friend, come in.","Extending two of his eyes till they almost touched the face-plate of his helmet, he could see activity at the base of the crater wall, and what looked like an air-lock entrance.","""I've been practically living on the stuff for the last two dren,"" said Darquelnoy hopelessly.","""Nasty?""","""Then you've picked up at least one of their habits,"" Ebor told him.","""Not a hint?""","Frankly, if it would do any good, I might even consider breaking one or two of the laws, and the devil with my conditioning.""","""They came here,"" Darquelnoy told him simply.","""What've they been up to, Dar?""","It was just that we had to rush around so frantically, unloading and dismantling the dome, getting this place ready--"" ""What do you mean, they _came_ here?""","*       *       *       *       * The two walked down the long corridor together and Ebor said, ""Well?",Darquelnoy shook a tentacle in negation.,"And before they had a chance to try again, I whipped everything underground.""","""Not at all, not at all.","Then the outer door closed, the pumps were turned on, and in a minute the red light flashed over the inner door.","Which isn't good for morale, either.""","""And here we sit.""",echoed Darquelnoy.,"""Did they get a picture of the dome?""","And the driver, he now saw, was aiming the car toward the nearby crater wall.","he asked, after a minute.","He led the way into his quarters, motioned Ebor to a perch, and rang for his orderly.","""Absolutely chilling.""","Ebor nodded, studying his friend.","""Oh, they've been boasting about doing some such thing for ages,"" Darquelnoy told him.","""I've worked up a fine thirst on the trip,"" Ebor told him.","But the base commander, Darquelnoy, waiting for his old friend Ebor near the inner door of the lock, looked anything but happy with the arrangement.",He was obviously at his wit's end.,"All of the furnishings had been transferred here from the original dome, and the result looked, on the whole, quite livable.","""I imagine you sometimes wish you could give them a little prodding in the right direction,"" he said.","All that crowd up there needs is an enemy, and it doesn't much matter to them who that enemy is.","""Don't tell me no!""","I could use some cheering up.""","""Longer than we had originally anticipated,"" Darquelnoy said frankly.","""I can't imagine them making a spaceship,"" said Ebor thoughtfully.","""None?""","Come on to my quarters.""","""There's already a theory among some of the workmen that the blow-up just isn't going to happen, ever.","""No, I don't imagine it is.""",Tell me the new jokes from home.,"At the moment, they've divided themselves into two camps--generally speaking, that is--and the two sides are trying like mad to outdo each other in everything.",He looked around.,The orderly entered.,"""I _saw_ it!""","""Don't make it so vivid.""","He wondered what had caused the change, which had obviously been done at top speed.","""It has been a long time,"" agreed Ebor.","*       *       *       *       * ""I wasn't talking necessarily about attacking them, you know,"" said Ebor, returning to the subject.","""It must have been hectic,"" Ebor said sympathetically.","""I would have thought so, too,"" said Darquelnoy.",He drained his cup of restno.,cried Darquelnoy.,"The last time he'd been here, not very long ago, the dome had still been intact, and there had been no hint of any impending move underground.",he cried.,"There hadn't been the slightest indication they were planning anything _that_ spectacular.""","""Catastrophic, you mean.","""Come on, you can tell me over a hot cup of restno.""","""I know, I know,"" said Ebor hastily.","Darquelnoy told him, ""Two restno,"" and he left again.","""I know,"" said Darquelnoy.",Ebor extended his eyes in surprise.,"""Neither was I,"" Darquelnoy told him.","""But there it is.","""I would have thought they'd have blown themselves up long before reaching that stage.""","Rooms and corridors has been melted out of the rock, the floors had been carpeted, the walls painted, and the ceiling lined with light panels.","If they were to suspect that we were here, they'd forget their own little squabbles at once and start killing us instead.","The driver steered the car into the open air lock, and they waited until the first cargo truck had lumbered in after them.","But it circled this Moon here, busily taking pictures, and went right back to the planet again, giving us all a terrible fright.","_They_ would attack _us_.""","""It was,"" said Darquelnoy simply.","""The fledgling attempt, you know.","""Absolutely the worst.""","""Then I'm surprised they haven't blown themselves to pieces long before this.""","""But there was never any indication that they were finally serious about it.",That would be enough.,"""They could go on that way indefinitely,"" said Ebor.",Darquelnoy clicked his eyes in despair.,"""You don't suppose this is all a waste of time, do you?""",he asked.,"""Now stop talking in circles and tell me what happened."""
