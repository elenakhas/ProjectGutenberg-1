like a child trying to say sparrow.,"The sudden lightening of his face surprised her again, violently, as she recalled it.","""I wish I understood ye, my dear.""","At the same time--if the girls wanted to rush about and scream and wear no hats nobody had any right to interfere with them ... they ought to be suppressed though, North London girls, capable of anything in the way of horridness ... the Pernes did not seem to see how horrid the girls were in themselves, common and knowing and horrid.",She wore a high-waisted black serge pinafore dress with black crape vest and sleeves.,As she struck her opening chords she watched her mother gently quell the narrative and steer the sturdy form towards a group of people hesitating in the doorway.,"""I wish I had a really stunning dress,"" remarked Miriam, as they tapped across the wide hall.",She bitterly resented their vision of children as malleable subordinates.,I don't say she's a child.,"""What?""","""How much do you think people could marry on?""","With you it should be well with a man.""",Sarah's strange clean clear channel of wisdom.,For a moment her heart cried out to him.,Mrs. Green is so strong and clever.,"""Eunice!""","She did not look up but sat frowning sourly into her bowl of bread and milk, ladling and pouring the milk from the spoon.","said Miriam, watching Eve bend a crimson face over the tea-tray on the hearthrug.",They were all tramping quickly up along the echoing corridor.,"With a sudden sense of daring, Miriam determined to assume the deserted avenue as part of the garden.","At the end of an hour spent pacing the half-dark platform exhausted with cold and excitement and the monotonously reiterated effort to imagine the arrival of one of Mrs. Hungerford's heroines from a train journey, Miriam, whose costume had been described in a letter to the girl's mother, was startled wandering amidst the vociferous passengers at the luggage end of the newly arrived train by a liquid colourless intimate voice at her elbow.","_That's_ the door in our cupboard!""",Miriam looked up.,Harriett coming up the garden with a basket of cut flowers saw her at the cook's bedroom window.,"""Magnifique, Mirry, parfaitement magnifique,"" intoned Tommy Babington, appearing in the doorway with Meg on his arm.",Of course he didn't.,"We'd better find a porter.""","""Oh, I'm sure I don't know.""","""They are so jolly and strong.","""All _right_, I'm coming, damn you, aren't I?""","And even if I did my throat is simply agonies at the end of each morning.""",She was surprised by a sudden suggestion that she should smoke the single cigarette herself.,I shan't come down at first.,Here she was helpless and alone.,"These were the things she wanted; gay house-parties, people with beautiful wavering complexions and masses of shimmering hair catching the light, fragrant filmy diaphanous dresses; these were the people to whom she belonged--a year or two of life like that, dancing and singing in and out the houses and gardens; and then marriage.","""Oh, I never shall--in any case now.""",Eh?,Were they all looking after them properly?,She might have spared herself all her agonising.,"""She doesn't approve of general conversation,"" thought Miriam.","Amongst them she noted Bevan Seymour, upright and slender, dancing with Harriett with an air of condescending vivacity, his bright teeth showing all the time.",It could be made to become the atmosphere of her life.,"How battered and ordinary everyone had looked, frail and sick, stamped with a pallor of sickness.","A bright yellow pathway led up through the green of the public cricket ground, pierced the avenue of poplars and disappeared through the further greenery in a curve that was the beginning of its encirclement of the park lake.",Why did they not come?,This stranger saw her only as a teacher.,"'s"" ... they were something much more than that.",I'm coming in.,"You simply run away from them,"" she said scornfully; ""go out for a walk or something.""","""D'you mean to say you've been never specially interested in anybody?""","Miriam stared at him as they passed, he was so short, shorter than any of the ladies he was with.","Her thwarted expectations ranged forth beyond control, feeling swiftly and cruelly about for succour where she had learned there was none.... Nancie, her parents abroad, her aunt's house at Cromer, with a shrubbery, the cousin from South Africa coming home to Cromer, taking her out in a dog-cart, telling her she was his guiding star, going back to South Africa; everything Nancie said and did, even her careful hair-brushing and her energetic upright walk, her positive brave way of entering a room, coming out through those malicious pin-points--things she said about the Misses Perne and the girls, things she whispered and laughed, little rhymes she sang with her unbearable laugh.","Khooo!""","said Bevvy in his _most_ superior manner.""","She veiled her waiting eyes and felt their radiance stream through her, flooding her with strength from head to foot."
