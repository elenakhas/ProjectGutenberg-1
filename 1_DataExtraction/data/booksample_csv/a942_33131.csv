"She does not boast of her mastery of nature, but to her she brings, with infinite care and joy, her offerings of love.","Life based upon science is attractive to some men, because it has all the characteristics of sport; it feigns seriousness, but is not profound.",The reaction of disillusionment is just as unreal as the first shock of illusion.,It is civilisation of human relationship.,"This experience of your soul, in meeting a personality in the heart of the world, has been embodied in your civilisation.","This dragon did not belong to the mythology of the past, but of the present; and with its iron mask it tried to look real to the children of the age,--real as the majestic rocks on the shore, as the epic rhythm of the sea-waves.","And the true expression of this love is in the language of beauty, which is so abundantly universal in this land.","It is science, but not its wrong application in life,--a mere imitation of our science teachers who reduce it into a superstition absurdly invoking its aid for all impossible purposes.","We know that, in the early stage of man's moral immaturity, he only feels reverence for the god whose malevolence he dreads.","And it has come to pass, that the children of those heroes, who would keep their word at the point of death, who would disdain to cheat men for vulgar profit, who even in their fight would much rather court defeat than be dishonourable, have become energetic in dealing with falsehoods and do not feel humiliated by gaining advantage from them.","A mere knowledge of things can be had in a short enough time, but their spirit can only be acquired by centuries of training and self-control.","The genius of Europe has given her people the power of organisation, which has specially made itself manifest in politics and commerce and in coordinating scientific knowledge.","In other great countries, signs of man's power loomed large, and I saw vast organisations which showed efficiency in all their features.","They are loud in their boast, that they have modernised Japan.","But, in Japan, it is not the display of power, or wealth, that is the predominating element.",Such a civilisation has the gift of immortality; for it does not offend against the laws of creation and is not assailed by all the forces of nature.,"What is still more dangerous for Japan is, not this imitation of the outer features of the West, but the acceptance of the motive force of the Western civilisation as her own.","This is the reason why a stranger, like myself, instead of feeling envy or humiliation before these manifestations of beauty, these creations of love, feels a readiness to participate in the joy and glory of such revealment of the human heart.",I feel it is an impiety to be indifferent to its protection from the incursion of vulgarity of power.,"Where man is at his greatest, he is unconscious.",Therefore I am afraid of the rude pressure of the political ideals of the West upon your own.,"In past ages we had foreign invasions, there had been cruelty and bloodshed, intrigues of jealousy and avarice, but they never touched the soul of the people deeply; for the people, as a body, never participated in these games.","This spiritual bond of love she has established with the hills of her country, with the sea and the streams, with the forests in all their flowery moods and varied physiognomy of branches; she has taken into her heart all the rustling whispers and sighing of the woodlands and sobbing of the waves; the sun and the moon she has studied in all the modulations of their lights and shades, and she is glad to close her shops to greet the seasons in her orchards and gardens and cornfields.","But the tidal wave of falsehood has swept over your land from that part of the world, where business is business, and honesty is followed in it merely as the best policy.","She has achieved something, which is positive and complete.","One must bear in mind, that those who have the true modern spirit need not modernise, just as those who are truly brave are not braggarts.","We must not vitiate our children's minds with the superstition, that business is business, war is war, politics is politics.","It pursues success with skill and thoroughness, and takes no account of the higher nature of man.","I have felt that you have been able to assimilate these secrets into your life, and the truth which lies in the beauty of all things has passed into your souls.","In political civilisation, the state is an abstraction and relationship of men utilitarian.","Therefore I cannot think that the imitation of the outward aspects of the West, which is becoming more and more evident in modern Japan, is essential to her strength or stability.","The divine in her heart is suffering from the injuries inflicted by her hands upon the world,--and from this pain of her higher nature flows the secret balm which will bring healing to those injuries.","Europe is not ready to give up her political inhumanity, with all the baser passions of man attendant upon it; she believes only in modification of systems, and not in change of heart.",Therefore its rivalry to things that are modest and profound and have the subtle delicacy of life is to be dreaded.,"Science speaks of the struggle for existence, but forgets that man's existence is not merely of the surface.","It is easy to be unfair in one's judgment when one is faced with human miseries,--and pessimism is the result of building theories while the mind is suffering.","For man's struggle for existence is to exist in the fullness of his nature,--not by curtailing all that is best in him and dwarfing his existence itself, but by accepting all the responsibilities of his spiritual life, even through death and defeat.","But while trying to free our minds from the arrogant claims of Europe and to help ourselves out of the quicksands of our infatuation, we may go to the other extreme and blind ourselves with a wholesale suspicion of the West.","When Japan is in imminent peril of neglecting to realise where she is great, it is the duty of a foreigner like myself to remind her, that she has given rise to a civilisation which is perfect in its form, and has evolved a sense of sight which clearly sees truth in beauty and beauty in truth.","It would be altogether unjust, both to us and to Europe, to say that she has fascinated the modern Eastern mind by the mere exhibition of her power.","And the time has come, when you have to be roused into full consciousness of the truth by which you live, so that you may not be taken unawares.","This opening of the heart to the soul of the world is not confined to a section of your privileged classes, it is not the forced product of exotic culture, but it belongs to all your men and women of all conditions.","Its harsh obtrusiveness makes it forcibly visible to us, overcoming our senses,--and we bring to its altar sacrifices, as does a savage to the fetish which appears powerful because of its hideousness.","The ideal of ""maitri"" is at the bottom of your culture,--""maitri"" with men and ""maitri"" with Nature.","It is really because we are afraid of our own weakness, which allows itself to be overcome by the sight of power, that we try to substitute for it another weakness which makes itself blind to the glories of the West.","After centuries of civilisation nations fearing each other like the prowling wild beasts of the night time; shutting their doors of hospitality; combining only for purpose of aggression or defence; hiding in their holes their trade secrets, state secrets, secrets of their armaments; making peace offerings to the barking dogs of each other with the meat which does not belong to them; holding down fallen races struggling to stand upon their feet; counting their safety only upon the feebleness of the rest of humanity; with their right hands dispensing religion to weaker peoples, while robbing them with their left,--is there anything in this to make us envious?","You have known her language of lines and music of colours, the symmetry in her irregularities, and the cadence in her freedom of movements; you have seen how she leads her immense crowds of things yet avoids all frictions; how the very conflicts in her creations break out in dance and music; how her exuberance has the aspect of the fullness of self-abandonment, and not a mere dissipation of display.","They brought their basket of fruits to me and held their lighted incense before my face, wishing to pay homage to a man who had come from the land of Buddha.","Therefore they are in harmony with life's growth, or else when the time comes they easily give way and are forgotten.",Things that are living are so easily hurt; therefore they require protection.,And this has been effected by the charm of the word 'modern.',"While travelling in a railway train I met, at a wayside station, some Buddhist priests and devotees.",They were merely the outcome of individual ambitions.,"Your race has shown that genius, not by acquirements, but by creations; not by display of things, but by manifestation of its own inner being.",But is this the ideal of man which we can look up to with pride?,"Are we to bend our knees to the spirit of this civilisation, which is sowing broadcast over all the world seeds of fear, greed, suspicion, unashamed lies of its diplomacy, and unctuous lies of its profession of peace and good-will and universal brotherhood of Man?","I do not for a moment suggest, that Japan should be unmindful of acquiring modern weapons of self-protection.","Your national unity has not been evolved from the comradeship of arms for defensive and offensive purposes, or from partnership in raiding adventures, dividing among each member the danger and spoils of robbery.","Is the instinct of the West right, where she builds her national welfare behind the barricade of a universal distrust of humanity?""","But if undiluted utility be modern, beauty is of all ages; if mean selfishness be modern, the human ideals are no new inventions.","There are races, who worship the animals they kill; we can buy meat from them, when we are hungry, but not the worship which goes with the killing.","But, unfortunately, all his armour is not living,--some of it is made of steel, inert and mechanical.","Never think for a moment, that the hurts you inflict upon other races will not infect you, and the enmities you sow around your homes will be a wall of protection to you for all time to come.","If he is weak enough to grow smaller to fit himself to his covering, then it becomes a process of gradual suicide by shrinkage of the soul.","So the questions you have to put to yourselves are these,--""Have we read the world wrong, and based our relation to it upon an ignorance of human nature?",But a mere political relationship is all conscious; it is an eruptive inflammation of aggressiveness.,"There, display and extravagance, in dress, in furniture, in costly entertainments, are startling.",Her relationship with the world is the deeper relationship of heart.,"Japan must be reminded, that it is her sense of the rhythm of life and of all things, her genius for simplicity, her love for cleanliness, her definiteness of thought and action, her cheerful fortitude, her immense reserve of force in self-control, her sensitiveness to her code of honour and defiance of death, which have given her the power to resist the cyclonic storm of exploitation that has sprung from the shores of Europe circling round and round the world.","It is discrediting the ideals, which were born of the lives of men, who were our greatest and best.","You have known that energies of nature save themselves from wearing out by the rhythm of a perfect grace, and that she with the tenderness of her curved lines takes away fatigue from the world's muscles.","Therefore she is ever ready for fight, and the best portion of her attention is occupied in organising forces.","Therefore the ideals, whose seats were in the hearts of the people, would not undergo any serious change owing to the policies adopted by the kings or generals.","It is not an outcome of the necessity of organisation for some ulterior purpose, but it is an extension of the family and the obligations of the heart in a wide field of space and time.","The past has been God's gift to you; about the present, you must make your own choice.",But this should never be allowed to go beyond her instinct of self-preservation.,"I am quite sure that there are men in your nation, who are not in sympathy with your national ideals; whose object is to gain, and not to grow.","And this is a point on which we in the East have to acknowledge our guilt and own that our sin has been as great, if not greater, when we insulted humanity by treating with utter disdain and cruelty men who belonged to a particular creed, colour or caste.","On my first arrival in this country, when I looked out from the balcony of a house on the hillside, the town of Kobe,--that huge mass of corrugated iron roofs,--appeared to me like a dragon, with glistening scales, basking in the sun, after having devoured a large slice of the living flesh of the earth.","For the rhythm of beauty is the inner spirit, whose outer body is organisation.","The moral law, which is the greatest discovery of man, is the discovery of this wonderful truth, that man becomes all the truer, the more he realises himself in others.","Your duty towards your state has naturally assumed the character of filial duty, your nation becoming one family with your Emperor as its head.","Our food crops, which are necessary for our sustenance, are products of centuries of selection and care."
