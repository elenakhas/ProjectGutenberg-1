that’s good to know for another time.",As soon as we saw it we shot it.” “And immediately got up a tree!,"I tried in vain to get him apart from the Kiowas to ask an explanation; but he seemed to suspect my intention, and stuck close to the Fox, which made me angrier than ever.","Of course I’m glad, for the easier the Apaches can overtake us, the easier we can capture them.","This gave me a chance for two rapidly repeated knife-thrusts, and this time I aimed better;

then I seized his left arm at the elbow and pulled him over till he had to let go of my throat.","We were standing, as already said, on an open prairie, and had been so occupied that the Apaches had crawled behind the bush which had served us in our attack on Tangua, and had surrounded us without our knowledge, and now sprang upon us from all sides in overpowering numbers.","“Old Shatterhand must shoot first.” “No,” I said.","I could have killed both the Apache chiefs; did I do so?” “You would have done so, but an Apache came up and struck you down with a tomahawk,” answered Intschu-Tschuna.",Let them torture us; it’s better than seeing such a figure of wretchedness before a man’s eyes.” I could not help wondering what Nscho-Tschi must think of me.,"We know which way they are coming; do you?” “They’ll go to the spot where they found us the other day, and follow on our trail.” “Right; you’re not so stupid as you look.","Intschu-Tschuna took my hand and led me away, saying: “My young white brother sees that this murderer does not deserve his intercession.","They are well cared for, because he who is to die by torture must be strong to endure or it is no punishment.” “And are they really to die?” “Yes.” “And I?” “You, too.” “Will Winnetou come to me?” “No.” “But I have something important to say to him.” “He will not hear it.",Did you not knock Winnetou down twice?,"Winnetou strode past him without looking at him, and led me to the stakes to which my three comrades were bound.","Each of your tribes can have a whole State, but the red man, the true owner, may not have a place to lay his head.",------------------------------------------------------------------------                               CHAPTER XV.,"uff!” echoed all around, and every one ran over to see where he had been wounded.","Their spies sit in the highest trees, and have surely seen us coming, and in the same way they’ll see the Apaches, for they can look all across the savanna.” “Well, what earthly good will it do us, if we’re overtaken, to have the Kiowas look across the savanna?” “Don’t you see?","Then two thongs were put around my ankles, so that I could take short steps, but could not jump or run.","I pretended not to see, and asked: “What’s up?",Compared with me you are like a toad which would attack a bear of the Rockies.,Then I heard Winnetou’s voice saying: “Is not Sam Hawkins mistaken?,"Of course they’ll be astonished, and light up the fire again to look for us, when we shall see them as plainly as we were seen before, and we’ll reverse the game and fall on them.","You may imagine, gentlemen, that Sam Hawkins followed after them.",Had it not been taken from me?,"How is it with the two brothers, the red and the white?","If he is captured, I’ll free him; and if a weapon is turned on him, I’ll stand by his side and fight for him.","I reached cautiously around the trunk of the tree, and felt of his feet and legs.","She had the same velvety black eyes, which were half concealed by long, dark lashes, and there was no trace in her, nor in him, of the high cheek-bones of the Indian; her soft oval cheeks curved into a chin with a mischievous dimple.","Has Selki-Lata [_Old Shatterhand_] really revived?” “Yes, yes; we all three saw it.",Why do you do this?,"You won’t have to act alone, for, whatever you do, we’ll stand by you.","“One—two—three.” I stood still, presenting the entire width of my body to my antagonist.","He proved to be mistaken, however; she only ran a little way, and then deliberately lay down and rolled.","As soon as the spectacle which is to end with his death begins he raises his death-song, in which he celebrates his own prowess and scorns those who are killing him.","I’ll tell you more of him another time; here we are at the camp.” “A mule, a mule!","“Be silent, and act, you red thief!” I replied.",“Your women are not more tender-hearted than we.,"She held out her hand to me, saying only: “Forgive.” She was to thank me, but instead begged for forgiveness.",It’s no fun waiting when you don’t know how a thing will turn out.” “Don’t know!,Do you know you have delivered yourself into my hands?” “Pshaw!,I have spoken.,"But though I have taught him all I could of Catholic truth, it may never be, for he shrinks from deserting the religion of his ancestors.","Yes, Rattler, they’ve got a banquet ready for you that I wouldn’t care to sit down to.","He took the clay for it himself from the sacred stone quarry, and I cut it.",I was shocked at Sam Hawkins and very angry with him.,"Nscho-Tschi saw it, and said: “That has done you good.",you seem to be in a hurry to fall into the hands of the Apaches.,"If I were in your place I would put a bullet into his head; he’ll do his best to get one into yours.” “Or in my heart; I know that perfectly well.” “But he won’t succeed; these Kiowas are no good at shooting.” The ground has been measured by this time, and we took our places.","We came over safely to the Kiowas, who stood like panthers crouching for prey.",“Don’t you know why?” replied Sam.,"The next moment I was on his back, and our positions were reversed.","Then we’re certain of the first thing we must know, and that is the direction from which we’re to expect them.","He answered my questions by movements of his head.” “It is marvellous, but it were better he had not come back, for he has returned to life but to be killed.” “But he is the Apaches’ best friend,” cried Sam.","Just put your education in lasso-throwing to the proof, that’s all.” “That’s a different thing; I’ll do that.” “All right; and I’ll use one in earnest, for I do need a horse.","If you spare him, you’re lost, and we with you.","How!” These wishes were not very practical, but they seemed to please the Indians as much as if they were already fulfilled.","Her delicate nose was rather of Grecian than of Indian type, and her skin was a light copper bronze, with a silvery tint.","With slow and dignified strides they went out of the thicket, we following.","Ask God’s pardon, if not mine;

and if I had to go under or between branches I tested them carefully to make sure that I could get through.,“We are saved!,"“At the hands of any other Indians,” Intschu-Tschuna said, “who knew what we know of these men, they would be given over to torture at once; but we will be obedient to the teaching of our White Father, and be a just judge; we will not condemn our enemies unheard, but they shall be convicted out of their own mouths.","In fleeing from the police I ran one day through a little garden and entered a dilapidated house, where I found an old mother and her daughter in direst need.",Isn’t that a stroke?,"I found his feet were tied together and bound by a thong to the tree, so that two knife-cuts would be necessary.","I mean to let them see me wandering around, so they’ll think we feel as safe as in Abraham’s bosom.","You’ve been fattened like a Martinmas goose, and for the same reason.","When everything was ready the bonds were removed from the chief, and we smoked the pipe that sealed his promise to me.",Then I must pull a long face.,He thinks it’s your fault that he has fallen into the Apaches’ hands.,"I heard a contemptuous murmur behind me, and Sam’s voice cried out: “For the love of Heaven, come back!"
