"And in the next moment the rock above his head, fissured deep by the rains, slipped again.","They had ample foreheads under the wild thatch of their hair, and high, well-bridged noses, and fierce, steady eyes of green, blue or brown-gray.","But if he had any preference, it was for the black mammalian beast, the lizard monster appearing to him the more alien, the more incomprehensible and the more impregnable to any strategy that he might devise.",Grôm hurled one of his two spears.,"Mounting a rock by the cave-door, he gazed up the valley, striving to make out the vanguard of the approaching hordes; while Grôm, marshalling the servitors of the fire, stationed them by the range of piles, ready to set light to them on the given word.","But the Shining One lost no prestige, thereby, for always, down there across the valley-mouth, kept leaping and dancing those unquenchable flames of scarlet, amber and violet, fed by the volcanic gases from within the crevice, and utterly regardless of whatever floods the sky might loose upon them.","They were not altogether ill-matched, these two colossal protagonists of the Saurian and the Mammal.",1.E.7.,"Here and there a black trunk, twisting in agony, lingered long, awful moments above the pitch.","Shouting to the men behind to come on, he waved his own fire-stick to a blaze, and followed Grôm.","From the depths of them flamed a ceaselessly changing radiance of blue-green, purple and violet.","Once, too, they had been treed by a bull urus, a gigantic white beast with a seven-foot spread of polished horns.",Some heavy splashes in the water behind them showed how the clumsy missiles of their foes--ragged clubs and fragments of broken branches--were falling short; and they looked back derisively.,"Not a bird-note, not the flutter of a wing, not the hum or the darting of a single insect, disturbed the strangely heavy air.","He glanced up cautiously, and saw hovering, not more than twenty or thirty yards away, a beautiful and dreadful being.","II A white, high-sailing moon streamed down into the amphitheater, where the scarred remnant of the tribe of the Little Hills, squatting before their cave-mouths, took counsel.","Screeches of horror arose, which brought all the hordes to a halt as far back as they could be heard.","""_Oh!_"" murmured A-ya, sympathetically, as the bright blood ran down his beard.",The stupendous duel had two interested spectators.,"One of the arrows he shattered completely, by driving it, at short range, straight against the rock-face of the mountain.","A few days later he excused himself to the Chief, saying that other women in his cave would be a nuisance, and would interfere with those studies of the Shining One which had proved so beneficial to the tribe.","""Back!""","They simply flocked to the nearest trees and hung themselves up, gigantic, jewelled blooms, upon the branches.",From all but Grom there went up a shriek so piercing that in their own ears it disguised the stupendous rending roar which at that moment seemed to stun the air.,"Along the near horizon ran a chain of those sharp, low summits, irregularly jagged against the pale blue.","Long before noon he had forsaken the brook, because its course had ceased to lead him westward.","However, if you provide access to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than ""Plain Vanilla ASCII"" or other format used in the official version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original ""Plain Vanilla ASCII"" or other form.",He swept a comprehensive and significant glance over the gaping crowd.,As he did so he saw the two lions approach the hiding-place of the monster.,"So the saw-toothed line of these dark, volcanic summits drew him irresistibly, with the promise of unknown wonders hidden behind them.","But now from a high ledge on the right, where the wall of the pass was a sheer perpendicular, came two shrill whistles.","demanded Grôm, in some surprise.",Grom decided that the safest thing was to keep perfectly still and wait for the next move in the game to come from the monster.,"This little but greatly daring band, which Grom, one flaming sunrise, led down into the unknown jungle, was well armed.",Grom noticed at once that she was nervous and puzzled.,"An enormous bull urus--perhaps the same beast which some days earlier, had driven Grom and the girl into the tree-tops--burst up, dripping and mud-streaked from his wallow in a reedy pool, and came charging upon the travelers with a roar.","No doubt, if necessary, he could use them again in some such fashion.",She was free at last.,"All that day, till mid-afternoon, he journeyed swiftly, straight ahead, taking no precaution save to keep always a vigilant watch and to avoid dark coverts whence tiger or leopard might spring upon him.","Her big, dark eyes, wild and furtive under the dark, tangled masses of her hair, kept wandering back and forth between the man's brooding face and the obscure black thickets which filled the valley behind him.","The giant Ook-ootsk, hideous with his ape-like forehead, his upturned, flaring nostrils, his protruding jaw, his shaggy, clay-colored torso, and his short, massive, grotesquely bowed legs--of which one was twisted so that the toes pointed almost backwards--lay sprawling and chuckling benevolently near the entrance, while a swarm of little ones, A-ya's two among them, clambered over him.","On the other hand, he knew that he had made a great discovery, second only to the conquest of the fire.","Grom's heart came near bursting with exultation, but he disdained to show it.","Together, perhaps, they would have been a match for him.",He was on the point of slipping around the trunk to investigate from another angle.,"For two or three hundred yards she kept on, drawing a wake of crimson behind her; and then, apparently exhausted by her wound, she turned off among the canes, and lay down, close beside the trail, but effectively screened from it.","And on the following day they returned to the fires of the tribe, carrying between them, shoulder high, slung upon their two spears, this first trophy of the bow, the monstrous head and hide of the saber-tooth.","A couple more had been trampled down and crushed before his charge was stayed by the irresistible pressure of the surging, squealing mass.","Still he hesitated, fingering his club; for the insolence of that challenging stare made his blood seethe.","While these preparations were being rushed--somewhat to the perplexity of the tribe, who could not fathom the tactics of stuffing the landscape with rubbish--Bawr was keeping a little band of scouts on guard at the far-off head of the valley.","To Grom's horror that stroke, which to any beast he knew would have at once been fatal, did not kill the monstrous fly.",Grom laughed proudly.,"he asked, in a tender voice, stroking her heavy mane.","Below them was a lovely, land-locked bay, with a herd of deer pasturing among scattered trees by the shore.",And he might as well have struck a mountain-side.,But it did not go deep enough to produce any serious effect.,"The monster, her eyes fixed upon the two remaining in the tree, never noticed his escape.",Its top touched earth.,"And the heavy wood was stacked outside, to right and left, in such a fashion as to form practical ramparts for the innermost line of defense.","It looked so queer, in its cooked state, charred black along the lower edge, that she hesitated to taste it.",Both A-ya and the boy were interested in a new toy.,"It was a strange place for a plover to lurk in, that rank thicket of jungle; but the Bow-legs took no notice of the incongruity.","Half the tribe at a time was obliged to stand on guard, and there was little sleep to refresh the weariest when the shadows beyond the barriers were alive with mutterings and prowlings, and terrible, paling, gleaming eyes.","But when the rest of the terrific herd came thundering down upon them, they fled in all haste.","If he was still the man she loved, her mate and lover, yet was he also now a sort of demi-god, since she had seen him play at his ease with the flames, and drive the hyena, the saber-tooth and the terrible red bear before him.","Not only the ground thickets, but the tree-tops as well, were swarming with his keen-eyed foes.","III For three weeks Grôm and the girl pressed on eagerly, swinging north to avoid a vast lake, whose rank and marshy shores were trodden by monsters such as they had never before set eyes upon.",Suddenly from the rocks above came a shrill cry.,"And we will make another just like it, that when we return to the Caves Bawr also shall know how to strike from very far off.""","The cows, meanwhile, pushing their calves into a huddled mass behind them, formed themselves into a second array, a reserve of less mass and strength than the ranks of the bulls, but of an invincible mother-fury.","And leading the way down into the unknown tide, he struck out straight ahead.","And the delay was more than compensated for by the new spirit which now seized this poor, fugitive remnant of the Tribe of the Little Hills.","Screeches of horror arose, which brought all the hordes to a halt as far back as they could be heard.","he ordered in a loud, sharp voice.","Then, with a great cry, he sprang to his feet.","Some growth must be found that was tough, perfectly straight, and tapering, while at the same time so solid and hard of grain that it would take and hold a point, and heavy enough for driving power.",Within an hour of his reaching this decision the Tribe of the Cave Folk was once more on the march.,"Fully three-parts of the carcase remained, indeed, but it was all raw flesh.",This effort was so successful that the stone went perfectly straight--and caught him fair on the thumb-knuckle.,"In half a minute he was once more at the front, fighting with renewed fury, his head and back and shoulders covered with blood.","Picking up a small stone, he held it upon the cord, bent the bow a little way, and let go.","An hour later, when the first pallor was spreading, she awoke with a cry of fear, and clung to Grôm's arm, shuddering strongly.","He gave vent to a shrill, bleating bellow--an absurdly inadequate utterance to issue from this mountainous frame--writhed his neck in snaky folds, and lashed out convulsively with the stupendous coils of his tail."
