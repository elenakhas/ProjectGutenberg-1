"""And I, for one, would like to know what that attraction ray was,"" said Fuller curiously.","The rest of us are going outside.""",That had started the terrible destructive war of the Black Star.,Arcot understood immediately what was meant.,Arcot dropped the ship swiftly until they were hovering a bare hundred feet over the waters of the lake.,He looked at the chronometer on the wall--he had slept twelve hours!,"The globe beneath them was lit brightly, for they had approached it from the daylight side.","""Very well, then.",Morey!,"Our proposition is too good for them to turn down.""","Again space seemed to be charged with a vast surplus of energy that rushed in from all around, coursing through their bodies, producing a tingling feeling.","""I noticed it,"" Arcot said.",Their every calculation had checked out in practice so far.,"""Fuller, I'm surprised at you!""",Torlos looked at him in surprise and then pointed mutely to a heavy belt he wore--made of closely woven links of iron wire!,"The modern space suit is made of woven lux metal wires of extremely small diameter and airproofed with a rubberoid fluorocarbon plastic, and furnished with air and heating units.",he managed to gasp.,Everyone cried out simultaneously--and Arcot was on his way to the control room.,I don't think you would--you've got good sense--but I like to make certain.,"""The main thing is the molecular power unit here, electrically heated and mounted on a small, massive gyroscope.","The next one, which he named Aphrodite, the Greek goddess corresponding to the Roman Venus, was only a little larger than Venus and was some eight million miles farther from its primary--seventy-five million miles from the central sun.",The air of the ship suddenly seemed supercharged with energy as the space around them became gray; then the stars were all before them.,And they rigorously guarded their own secrets.,"Remember, it would weigh about two hundred tons!","They couldn't measure the parallax to the nearest star, so they would have no idea of stellar distances.",He touched a switch.,"""The question is: How helpless are we?""",Arcot gave them the exact specifications for the lead wire they needed.,"In the path of the projector was a large lux metal crucible surrounded by a ring of relux, and a series of points of relux aimed into the crucible.","But, because of it's great mass, our orbital velocity is something terrific!",Torlos nodded.,"As the light haze of the ionized air below them glowed out in a huge cone, the water of the lake heaved and seemed to move in its depths, but there was no great movement of the waters; they lost only a fraction of their weight.",If only we hadn't all passed out!,"""Some jump,"" said Morey, in mock surprise.","And they could only be polished under powerful magnets, where the dense magnetic field softened the lux metal enough to allow a diamond polisher to do the job.",Morey punched figures into the calculator.,"They are going to attack you, believing that you, despite your weapons, will go down before superior numbers.","""What was the matter with my calculations?""","""How fast does sound travel?""","""It's a wonder we didn't burn up at that velocity,"" said Fuller.","Another silver bar fuse was inserted, and Wade checked the relays to make sure they were in working order.","""Wade, take the forward molecular beams; Fuller, you handle the heat projector.""","Then, as they turned to follow the sudden motion of the ship--_it was not there!_ The _Ancient Mariner_ had vanished!","""Threw the gyroscopes, didn't it?""",They were unfamiliar stars in unfamiliar constellations--the stars of another universe.,"""Maybe--unless it was mutual annihilation!""","We wouldn't get anywhere using molecular power; that giant sun was just too damned generous with his energy of fall!""","Of their original supply of twenty tons of lead fuel, only ten tons of the metal were left, but lead was a common metal which they could easily pick up on any planet they might visit.",Suddenly they were both plastered against the wall of the ship under four gravities of acceleration!,"Suicide is preferable to dying of cold.""","""He started breathing _before_ the fight started.","""At least several million--"" Morey began.",Arcot turned to the intercom.,"""I put a canary into the air, and the bird liked it, so I imagine it's quite safe except for bacteria, perhaps.",They drifted high over the south temperate zone.,I saw the muzzle of his pistol as he was aiming and jumped in the way of the bullet.,Morey nodded.,"And, despite your strength, you are helpless against me!""","""After all, you're the astronomer, I'm not.",They returned to the capital at once.,"If he ate you, it might kill him in the end, but that would be small consolation.",Arcot grabbed Morey's leg and turned his power down until he had a weight of fifty pounds.,One of the guards was trying to reach for Arcot.,"""Say!","As the others got the suits ready, he lowered the ship gently to the snowy ground.","Watch yourselves; we don't want them even to touch this ship until we know what kind of people they are.""",Arcot nodded.,"My, doesn't he look energetic?""","""How are you going to get out to a point halfway between these two stars when you don't have enough power to lift this ship a few miles?""",We drained out three-fourths of the energy from our coils and lost our bearings in the bargain.,"""Not before breakfast.",Torlos relaxed and grinned sheepishly.,"The pale rays reached out to touch the battleship, and wherever they touched, the ships went down in wreckage, falling to the city below.","Then it was out, and, in a great semi-cylinder a quarter of a mile high, and a quarter of a mile in radius, they advanced toward the _Ancient Mariner_.","""If we'd shot at it, we would have really done ourselves in!","The conductors are setting up a secondary field in the plate and causing trouble.""",Torlos stopped at the door and saluted.,"""The only thing I can think of that would produce an effect like that is a stream of positrons--or contraterrene nuclei.","""Safe enough,"" said Arcot bitterly.","""Why can't we calculate the distance between two of these stars and then go on in?""",The elder Dr. Arcot glanced in surprise at the heavy-duty ammeter in a control panel.,"The mighty blaze of Sirius had warmed Pluto, vaporizing its atmosphere and thawing its seas.","If you did, we'd be left behind, and you'd never find us in the vast immensity of intergalactic space."""
