"*       *       *       *       * In our next talk we shall speak of some who sang beside him, and of some who followed; but of these not one had so rare a language, and not one had so true an eye.","True, old Burleigh was wont to complain that her Majesty made him frequent visits, and that every one cost him a matter of two or three thousand pounds.","[93] Philip Sidney, b.","But if a man wanders otherwheres and makes report, he may tell lies, and the lies may amuse and get him fame.",For he had been early presented to that monarch--even before Henry had come to the throne--and had charmed him by his humor and his scholarly talk: so that when More came to live upon his little farm at Chelsea (very near to Cheyne Row where Carlyle died but a few years since) the King found his way thither on more than one occasion; and there are stories of his pacing up and down the garden walks in familiar talk with the master.,"Camelot is not so easy to trace: the name will not be found in the guide-books: but in Somersetshire, in a little parish, called “Queen’s Camel,” are the remains of vast entrenchments, said to have belonged to the tourney ground of Camelot.","as few and sparse as then, what a range for enterprising authors!",viii.,(_Aside._) That I could stab her standing there!,"The further story once obtained that he went with a gay retinue to Florence, where the lists were opened--in the spirit of an older chivalry--to this Stranger Knight, who challenged the world to combat his claims in behalf of the mythical Geraldine.",_Aldwyth_--I go.,"And out of these scattered actualities, as regards the Earl, Sir Walter Scott has embroidered his delightful romance.","His rhymes, as he tells us himself, were “ragged and jagged:” but worse than this, they were often ribald and rabid--attacking with fierceness Cardinal Wolsey--attacking his fellow-priests too--so that he was compelled to leave his living: but he somehow won a place afterward in the royal household as tutor; and even the great Erasmus (who had come over from the Low Countries, and was one while teaching Greek at Cambridge) congratulates some prince of the royal family upon the great advantage they have in the services of such a “special light and ornament of British literature.” He is capricious, homely, never weak, often coarse, always quaint.","236-37), gives good reasons for doubting this story which is based mainly on the Jonson-Drummond interviews.","_The King’s Quair_, from which quotation is made, was written in 1423.","Possibly;[45] but it was not an easy journey over the mountains to Padua in those days, even if Petrarch had been domiciled there,--which is very doubtful; for the Italian poet, old and feeble, passed most of the latter years of his life at Arqua among the Euganean hills; and if Chaucer had met him, Petrarch would have been more apt to ask the man from far-away, murky England, about his country and King and the Prince Lionel (dead in those days), who only a few years before had married, at Milan, a daughter of the Visconti--than to bore him with a story at second hand (from Boccaccio) about the patient Griselda.",The “Hakluyt Society” of England will be his enduring monument.,"For all that Crécy or its smoking artillery had to do with his song, he might have sung a century earlier, or he might have sung a century later.","He that travelleth     into a country before he hath some entrance into the language,     goeth to school and not to travel.”     Of Friendship:--“This communicating of a man’s self to his     friend, works two contrary efforts; for it redoubleth joys     and cutteth griefs in halves.” Again, of the advantages of     talk with a friend:--“Certain it is, that whosoever hath his     mind fraught with many thoughts, his wits and understanding do     clarify and break up, in the communicating and discoursing with     another; he tosseth his thoughts more easily; he marshalleth     them more orderly; he seeth how they look when they are turned     into words; finally, he waxeth wiser than himself: and that     more by an hours discourse than by a days meditation.” Thus I could go on for page after page of citations which you would approve, and which are so put in words that no mending or shortening or deepening of their force seems anyway possible.","It is a bare rag of story, with only streaks of blood-red in it; yet how tenderly touched, and how pathetically told, in Chaucer’s tale of the Prioress!","But from the date of Wyclif’s translation--forward, forever--whatever man, rich or poor, could read an English ordinance of the King, or a bye-law of a British parish, could also--though he might be driven to stealthy reading--spell his way back, through the old aisles of Sacred History, where Moses and the prophets held their place, and into the valleys of Palestine, where Bethlehem lay, and where Christ was hung upon the tree.","_Cranmer, Latimer, Knox, and Others._ A much nobler figure is this, to my mind, than that of Cranmer,[73] who appears in such picturesque lights in the drama of Henry VIII.--who gave adhesion to royal wishes for divorce upon divorce; who always colored his religious allegiances with the colors of the King; who was a scholar indeed--learned, eloquent; who wrought well, as it proved, for the reformed faith; but who wilted under the fierce heats of trial; would have sought the good will of the blood-thirsty Mary; but who gave even to his subserviencies a half-tone that brought distrust, and so--finally--the fate of that quasi-martyrdom which has redeemed his memory.","Amid those shadows she stands--startled: a strong, sweet figure of a peasant maiden; stoutly clad and simply; capable of harvest-work with the strongest of her sisterhood; yet not coarse; redeemed through every fibre of body and soul by a light that shines in her eye, looking dreamily upward; seeing things others see not; hoping things others hope not, and with clenched hand putting emphasis to the purpose--which the hope and the vision kindle; pitying her poor France, and nerved to help her--as she did--all the weary and the troublesome days through, till the shameful sacrifice at English hands, on the market-place of Rouen, closed her life and her story.",Geve vs this daye oure dayly breade.,"And what were the books, pray, which Master Caxton--who, for a wonder, was a shrewd business man, as well as inclined to literary ways--thought it worth his while to set before the world?","_Henry V. and War Times._ This fifteenth century--in no chink of which, as would seem, could any brave or sweet English poem find root-hold, was not a bald one in British annals.","[98] We are disinclined, however, to accept the same biographer’s over-mild treatment of the bribe-taking, as a “moral negligence”--coupling it with Dr. Johnson’s moral delinquency of lying a-bed in the morning!","Bacon died, as we have said, in 1294.",An occasional sample of his work appears from time to time on the market even now; but not at prices which are inviting to the most of us.,"Not very many years after this--just how many we cannot say--comes the great tragedy of his life: A new Irish rebellion (that of Tyrone) sends up its tide of fire and blood around his home of Kilcolman; his crops, his barns, his cattle, his poor babe[92]--the last born--all are smothered, and consumed away in that fiery wrack and ruin.","The King came home, you will remember, by the way of Austria, and was caught and caged there many months--for a time none of his people knowing where he was: this is good romance and history too.","This is John Knox,[78] a near contemporary though something younger than most I have named, and not ripening to his greatest power till Henry VIII.","Thy wyll be fulfilled, as well in erth, as hit     ys in heven.",vii.),"[51] Dean Stanley, without doubt in error, in measuring the pilgrimage by twenty-four hours.","A. Buchon_), tome iii., p. 236.",He makes honey out of coarse flowers; not so sure always--nor much caring to be sure--of the name and habitudes of the plants he rifles.,"Shakespeare, also, at a time not far removed from Lyly’s conquest, perhaps intended a slap at the euphuistic craze,[96] in the pedant Schoolmaster’s talk of “Love’s Labor’s Lost.” Yet there was a certain good in this massing of epithets, and in this tesselated cumulation of nice bits of language, from which the more wary and skilful of writers could choose--as from a great vocabulary--what words were cleanest and clearest.","After printing was invented, and an easier way of making books was in vogue than the old one of tediously copying them upon parchment--I say in this new day of printing a certain Sir Thomas Mallory, who lived at the same time with Caxton, the first English printer, did, at the instance, I think, of that printer--put all these legends we speak of into rather stiff, homely English prose--copying, Caxton tells us, from a French original: but no such full French original has been found; and the presumption is that Mallory borrowed (as so many book-makers did and do) up and down, from a world of manuscripts.","Yet withal, this Chaucer is in some sense a man of the world and courtier.","A large portion of the old religious house, kept in excellent repair, and very charming with its growth of ivy and its embowering shade, is held in private hands--being the occasional residence of the Duke of Cleveland.","[19] Among other direct Arthurian growths may be noted MORRIS’S _Defence of Guinevere_; ARNOLD’S _Tristram and Issult_; QUINET’S _Merlin_, WAGNER’S Operatic Poems, and SMITH’S _Edwin of Deira_.",1615.,"Before the plot is carried out, the Prince agrees privately with Poins (one of the rogues) to put a trick upon Falstaff: Poins and the Prince will slip away in the dusk--let Falstaff and his companions do the robbing; then, suddenly--disguised in buckram suits--pounce on them and seize the booty.",There could be no greater mistake.,"He tells of the Barons’ Wars, of the miseries of Queen Margaret, of how David killed Goliath, of Moses in the burning bush--in lines counting by thousands; _Paradise Lost_ stretched six times over would not equal his pile of print; and all the verse that Goldsmith ever wrote, compared with Drayton’s portentous mass would seem like an iridescent bit of cockle-shell upon a sea of ink.","But there is a Welsh monk--Geoffrey of Monmouth[13]--living just on the borders of Wales, and probably not therefore brought into close connection with this new Norman element--who writes (about one hundred years after the Conquest) a half-earnest and mostly-fabulous British Chronicle.",Spenser sees much of this fiery work; and its blaze reddens some of the pages of the _Faery Queen_.,"who appears now upon the throne, and who was not a very noticeable man, save for his kingship, you will remember as the little son of John of Gaunt, who played about Chaucer’s knee; you will remember him further as giving title to a pair of Shakespeare’s plays, in which appears for the first time that semi-historic character--that enormous wallet of flesh, that egregious villain, that man of a prodigious humor, all in one--Jack Falstaff.","But he believed most of all in the full utterance of his beliefs, and in experimenting, and in interrogating nature, and distrusting conventionalisms, and in search for himself into all the mysteries, whether of nature or theology.",His _Anatomie of Abuses_ first published in 1583.,"“I myself have thought good to imitate the Italy fashion by     this forked cutting of meate not only while I was in Italy, but     also in Germany, and oftentimes in England, since I came home.” Thus we may connect the history of silver forks with Tom Coryat’s _Crudities_, and with the first reported foot-journeys of an Englishman over the length and breadth of Europe.","Yet even at a time when the writers of such psalmodies received small crumbs of favor from the Court, the English Bible was by no means a free-goer into all companies.",1563; d. 1631.,"At last he has it trippingly; so--schoolward and homeward,               as he cam to and fro     Full merrily than would he sing and crie,     O _Alma Redemptoris_ ever mó,     The sweetnesse hath his hertë perced so.","It was in 1477 that William Caxton issued the first book, printed with a date, in England.","But there were some to be remembered too: there was William Camden--to whom I have briefly alluded already--and of whom, when you read good histories of this and preceding reigns, you will find frequent mention.","_King._ O Kate, [loftily] _nice customs courtesy to great     Kings_:--here comes your father.","And travelling merchants find their way to such homes--bringing glass beads from Venice, and little dainty mirrors, just now the vogue in that great City by the Sea;

walke up and downe by the rest as scornfully and     as carelessly as a Gentleman-Usher: Select some friend (having     first throwne off your cloake) to walke up and downe the roome     with you, … and this will be a meanes to publish your clothes     better than Powles, a Tennis-court, or a Playhouse; discourse     as lowd as you can, no matter to what purpose if you but make     a noise, and laugh in fashion, and have a good sower face to     promise quarrelling, you shall be much observed.","[69] By the same standard the average Earl had a revenue of £20,000, and the richest of the peers is put down at a probable income of three times this amount.","But the big Knight blurts out--“A plague on all cowards!” He has been beset, while the Prince had sneaked away; the spoils are gone:     “I am a rogue, if I was not at half a sword with a dozen of     them two hours together; I have scaped by a miracle; I am eight     times thrust thro’ the doublet--four thro’ the hose.",[94] The first edition of Rinaldo was printed at Venice in 1562: this great epic was completed at Padua in 1575.,"But he did stay long enough to get a thorough taste for learning, and a thorough grounding in it.","of England, Francis I. of France, and Charles V. of Spain, Germany, and the Low Countries.","My answer hath been, would he had blotted a thousand.",See also Trans.,"If we keep by the strict letter of history, there is little of literary interest in that short reign of his--only fourteen years.","If thy estate be good,     match near home and at leisure: if weak--far off, and quickly.",_Philip Sidney._ Meantime what has become of that Philip Sidney[93] who flashed upon us under the eyes of Elizabeth at the age of twenty-four?,Cloth-makers came over from Flanders and made settlements in England.,"Sotheli an other of his disciplis saide to hym--Lord,     suffre me go first and birye my fadir.",Best edition of works edited by Rev.,Shall we meet again?,"[110] There is an exquisite sonnet usually attributed to him beginning--“Since there’s no help, come let us kiss and part;” but this is so very much better than all his other sonnets, that I cannot help sharing the doubts of those who question its Drayton origin.","Forsothe Jhesus saide to     hym, Sue thou me, and late dede men birye her dead men.” It is surely not very hard reading;--still less so in the form as revised by Purvey,[39] an old assistant of his in the Parish of Lutterworth; and it made the groundwork of an English sacred dialect, which with its _Thees_ and _Thous_ and _Speaketh_ and _Heareth_ and _Prayeth_ has given its flavor to all succeeding translations, and to all utterances of praise and thanksgiving in every English pulpit.","Before the first quarter of the century had passed, the monk Luther had pasted his ticket upon the doors of the church at Wittenberg; and that other soldier-monk, Loyola, was astir with the beginnings of Jesuitism.",_King._ [Explosively and deliciously.],"MURATORI (_Annali_) mentions Petrarch as seated among the princely guests--_tanta era la di lui riputazione_--but there is, naturally enough, no naming of Chaucer or Froissart.","Remember you have no father; and you have little     enough--if not too little, regarded your kind, _no-simple_     mother’s wholesome advice.”     And again: “Look well to your health; sup not, nor sit not up     late; surely I think your drinking near to bedtime hindereth     your and your brother’s digestion very much: I never knew any     but sickly that used it; besides ill for head and eyes.” And     again, in postscript: “I trust you, with yr servants, use     prayers twice in a day, having been where reformation is."
