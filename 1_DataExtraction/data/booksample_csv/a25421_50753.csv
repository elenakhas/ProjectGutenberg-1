They were impatient and easily incapacitated by frustration.,"""Gods?""","""That's queer.","""If I am not mistaken, we have laid down similar caches.""",the Explorer exploded.,"They seem to have been obsessed by the notion that others, greater than themselves, had prospered before them and then died, leaving them to rebuild a civilization from ruins.",Their appetites and emotions were not sufficiently subordinated to their understanding and to their sense of drama--their enjoyment of the comedy and tragedy of existence.,"I couldn't wait to hear the details.""","If I am to tell you everything you want to know, I must tell it my own way.","You'd think we'd be turning up traces everywhere.""","They seem to have been singularly guilty in their pleasures, behaving either like gloomy moralists or gluttons.","""The first is the most obvious.","""All in good time.",The Explorer sounded anguished.,"""At any rate, when I heard that what we were looking for, you had found here at home--even though dead and done for--I felt that at least it was something.",The present is always more important than the future.,"""As soon as our spaceship got within radio range of Earth, they started to send us a continuous newscast covering the period of our absence.","They might have been birds, except they moved too slowly.",Then the Explorer turned back.,"I suppose I set too much store by my hopes of establishing a contact.""","Instead, I touch only corpses.","The Explorer burst out, ""I am not interested in all that dry stuff!","""Yes, I guess you're right.",Am I going to have to coax you?,"But that fourth answer--it's morbid.""",It captured my imagination.,Our past is strewn with our dead.,"""Cute little brute, isn't it?""","""Really, your absence from Earth has unsettled you even more than I first surmised.","I grant the possibility of atomic power getting out of hand, though one would have thought they'd have taken the greatest precautions.","I can understand that after your long absence from Earth, any news of Earth would seem especially important.","*       *       *       *       * ""They had spaceships?""","""If these creatures were relatively advanced, why haven't we learned about them before?","""It's barely possible.","""I'm pleased that you should think of me and my work, and I'm very happy to see you again.",He looked at the Explorer strangely.,Their technology outstripped their psychology.,Geologic ages of it.,he remarked.,"""I have four answers to that,"" the Archeologist replied.",*       *       *       *       * The Archeologist regarded him quizzically.,"What happiness they had, they had.","One of the items, exasperatingly brief, mentioned your discovery.","I mean, what if the creatures occupied a very different portion of the Earth than our own?","""You old devil,"" he said in a manner that showed his gayer and more boisterous mood had returned, though diminished, ""you still haven't told me anything definite about them.""","What did they want?""","It was probably created in a kind of exuberant fancifulness, with no serious belief that it would ever serve the purpose for which it was intended.""",Again the slow shadows drifted overhead.,Why not species?,"""I think I understand,"" the Archeologist said softly.","He went on, ""The cache was laid down when they were first attempting space flight, just after their discovery of atomic power, in the first flush of their youth.","""So I haven't,"" replied the Archeologist with guileful innocence.",The Archeologist gently waved aside the questions.,What were they like?,"After a moment the Archeologist continued, ""My reconstruction of their history, subsequent to the laying down of the cache, has been largely hypothetical.","Somehow one thinks of an alien species as having just one language.""","They skimped fatally when it came to hard thinking about the purpose of life and intellectual activity, and the means for preserving them.""","Well, we found some planets with life upon them, all right.","""What about what?""",His expression showed only pleasure at being reunited with a long-absent friend.,It's the find of the age!,"His excitement had visibly evaporated, leaving behind a cold and miserable residue of feeling.","Third, it's possible that atomic energy, out of control, finished the race and destroyed its traces.","You shift in an instant from zenith to nadir--and remember, out there you can see both.","Still, it could happen.",interrupted the Explorer.,What did they create?,"""I am not sure I want to hear much more about them,"" he said.",There is a kind of unraveling or erasing.,"These words and symbols seem to have come down unchanged from their most distant prehistory.""",*       *       *       *       * The Explorer turned away.,"They set great store by personal prestige, by the amassing of wealth and the exercise of power.","Supplementary material has been very slow in coming in, though we are still making extensive excavations at widely separated points.","There's so little of it, and it's so lonely.",Time.,Machines are broken up and worked into primitive tools and weapons.,"But admit it now, isn't there something a bit odd about your getting so worked up over this thing?","And all the while there was wriggling toward them out of that future for which they yearned ... oh, it's so completely futile and unfair.""",*       *       *       *       * Several small shadows crossed the windows overhead.,Give me the wet!,"I rather hope they did, since it would mean the chance of a survival elsewhere, though the negative results of your expedition rather lessen that.""",The present distribution of radioactive compounds throughout the Earth's surface lends some support to this theory.,The Archeologist's expression showed that this was not altogether untrue.
