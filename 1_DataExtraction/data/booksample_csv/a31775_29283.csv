"Thad flung himself flat, grasped the wire above the reel.",It was hurled howling to the deck.,"Rubbish, of course.",A queer ache came into his heart.,Collected specimens of some alien life.,"But how came a rocket-flier here, in the perilous swarms of the meteor belt?","He started across the hold, shrinking involuntarily from the armored enormities that seemed crouched to spring at him, motionless eyes staring.","A powerful electromagnet, with a thin, strong wire fastened to it, to be hurled from a helix-gun.","Only one legible entry did he find, that on a page torn from the book, which somehow had escaped destruction.","He fumbled in the bulky inside pockets of his suit, found a slab of concentrated food, and tossed it out through the opened panel.","The officers of interplanetary liners lose no love upon the meteor miners, claiming that their collected masses of metal, almost helpless, always underpowered, are menaces to navigation.",That was the obvious implication.,The captain's cabin held evidence of a violent struggle.,"But it returned in a sickening wave when he heard the short, shrill, coughing cries, hideously eager, that greeted the opening of the door.",Had a man fought here and been killed?,"He waited, repeated the call.",And not a trace.,"But there was a large bloodstain, black and circular, on the floor of the calculator's room.","Grinning wanly, and conscious of a weakness in the knees, he muttered: ""They sure will fill the museum, if everybody gets the kick out of them that I did.","A pretty piece of salvage, he reflected, if he could land her on Mars.","_Red Dragon._ The name of her home port, below, was in smaller letters.","But an invisible being, that could creep upon him and strike unseen!","The deck was deserted, lit only by three dim blue globes, hanging from the curved roof.","Save for the extreme, cadaverous pallor, there was no mark of death.","They recorded the departure from Titania, made almost as soon as the treasure was loaded.",Invisible claws!,The vibration of the metal sphere increased.,"He was sure he could manage the ship if its mechanism were in good order, though he was uncertain of his ability to make any considerable repairs.","The dog sprang upon it, wolfed it eagerly, and came back to his side.","Nowhere was it broken, though he found scars where small meteoric particles had scratched the brilliant polish.","Could it be that legendary green ship, said once to have mysteriously appeared, sliced up and drawn within her hull several of the primitive ships of that day, and then disappeared forever after in the remote wastes of space?",He broke the flimsy fastening.,"Then he saw that it was turning, end over end, very slowly.",Thad thought that the unpleasant earthy odor he had noticed upon opening the face-plate of his helmet was stronger here.,It gave.,"It flung away from him, the wire screaming from the reel behind it.",If only he could find some way to make the thing visible!,A claw ripped savagely at his side.,"He got to his feet, and gazed backward into the starry gulf, where his sphere of iron had long since vanished.","But      what is one to think?""",A shriek so keen and shrill that it seemed to tear out his nerves by their roots.,For a painful instant he thought he had missed.,"Ominous, threatening stillness filled the ship again, disturbed only by the whimpers and frightened growls of the dog.","He heard it tear again, along his right thigh.",The yellow dog crouched whimpering against his legs.,"Before him was a tiny, glowing fleck, that moved among the unchanging stars.","Glittering in the blue light, it looked unreal.","Everything was clean, bright with polish or new paint.","Shapes of creatures somewhat like gigantic spiders, and more unlike them.",They were dead.,"It was filled with monstrous things, colossal creatures, such as nothing that ever lived upon the Earth; like nothing known in the jungles of Venus or the deserts of Mars, or anything that has been found upon Jupiter's moons.","Its fragments, with pieces of broken furniture, books, covers from the berth, and three service pistols, were scattered about in indescribable confusion, all stained with blood.",It was not beyond reason that such a planet should be inhabited by beings invisible to human sight.,A few tattered scraps of cloth beside it.,"For a moment it struggled furiously, as if an invisible claw had pinned it down.","""Somebody is going to find himself a nice chunk of metal, all welded together and equipped for rocket navigation,"" he murmured.",He tried one at random.,But what had he fought?,"With a sharp, eager bark, it leaped up at Thad, pawing at his armor and licking it, standing on its hind legs and reaching toward the visor of his helmet.",The vessel answered readily to her helm.,"He set the drum on which the wire was wound upon the metal at his feet, fastened it with its magnetic anchor, wondering if it would stand the terrific strain when the wire tightened.",The yellow dog seemed half to forget its fear.,"A form of weird horror materialized before him, still half invisible, half outlined with the white film of adhering powder: gigantic and hideous claws, that seemed to reach out of empty air, the side of a huge, scaly body, a yawning, dripping jaw.",The hold was not inviting.,It must be large and very ferocious.,"The air must be good, he thought, if the dog could live in it.","At Comet's place in Helion, down by the canal.","They were monsters remotely resembling insects or crustaceans, but as large as horses or elephants;
