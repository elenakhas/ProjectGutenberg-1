But what had he fought?,He thought she looked very lovely--like the waiting girl in his old dream of the silver tower in the red hills by Helion.,"I suppose he ventured away from the rest, and      something caught him.""",He dared not think the answer.,Incredible.,He could hear nothing.,Then the wire was all out; there was a sudden jerk.,"It leaped up at his face again, with another short little bark.","That meant that its gyros were stopped; that it was helpless, drifting, disabled, powerless to avoid hurtling meteoric stones.","*       *       *       *       * The remainder of the entries Thad found less frequent, shorter, bearing the mark of excitement: landing upon Titania, the third and largest satellite of Uranus; unearthly forests, sheltering strange and monstrous life; the hunting of weird creatures, and mounting them for museum specimens.",Nor in the throat of any animal he knew.,"It stood at the door, looking anxiously after him, trembling and whimpering pitifully.","What a lark, to explore a few new worlds of our      own!","But he had studied interplanetary navigation, to qualify for his license to carry masses of metal under rocket power through the space lanes and into planetary atmospheres.",And all was very still.,"The scratching of claws, Thad knew.",He relaxed.,"He heard it tear again, along his right thigh.",Poor Mr.      Tom James.,"To be sure, the issue of the combat was extremely doubtful.","And something seemed to catch the dog in mid-air, as it leaped.","A little dog, yellow, nondescript, pathetically delighted.","Shapes of creatures somewhat like gigantic spiders, and more unlike them.","But      what is one to think?""","At first sight, it was impossible to determine size or distance or rate of motion.","Regular scraping sounds came from the end of the deck, where no moving thing was to be seen--sounds such as might be made by the walking of feet with unsheathed claws.",No wonder the cook was afraid of them.,"Would he be in time to capture it as it passed, or would it hurtle by ahead of him, and vanish in the limitless darkness of space before his feeble rocket could check the momentum of his ball of metal?","And Benny won't be proposing again soon!""","But with the space lanes policed as they were, piracy and successful mutiny were rare.",Thad could expect nothing from the ship save a heliographed warning to keep clear.,"By law, it was his duty to attempt to aid any helpless ship, or at least to try to save any endangered lives upon her.","Before him was a tiny, glowing fleck, that moved among the unchanging stars.",It had apparently been occupied by a woman.,"*       *       *       *       * It was nearer now, rushing obliquely across his path.","The bright, eager eyes were alight with joy.","When he returned to where he could see the hurtling object before him, he saw that it was a ship.",The guns were empty.,"But Thad, searching the dimly-lit deck, could see no source of alarm.",A frail blue silk dress and more intimate items of feminine wearing apparel were hanging above the berth.,"She was not, by any means, completely wrecked.","Sensing the animal's terror, pitying it for the naked fear in its eyes, Thad wondered what dramas of horror it might have seen.","He stared at it intensely, breathing faster in the helmet.",What had become of the bodies of those who must have died in these conflicts?,"""Don't worry, old boy.","He found the heliograph signal mirror at his side, sighted it upon the ship, and worked the mirror rapidly.","Swiftly, he opened the door....        *       *       *       *       * Thad had partially overcome the instinctive horror that the unseen being had first aroused in him.","With new anxiety, he measured the relative motion of the gleaming ship.","But that seemed unlikely, since the ship must have been divided into several compartments by air-tight bulkheads.",But Thad was not without hope.,"It was filled with monstrous things, colossal creatures, such as nothing that ever lived upon the Earth; like nothing known in the jungles of Venus or the deserts of Mars, or anything that has been found upon Jupiter's moons.","Its fragments, with pieces of broken furniture, books, covers from the berth, and three service pistols, were scattered about in indescribable confusion, all stained with blood.",*       *       *       *       * The decision to open the door cost a huge effort of Thad's will.,"He was sure he could manage the ship if its mechanism were in good order, though he was uncertain of his ability to make any considerable repairs.","Automatically be flung up the welding tool, flicking over the lever with his thumb, so that violet electric flame played about the electrode.","When silence came again, Thad was standing with his back against the wall, the welding arc in his hand.",That was the obvious implication.,"Demoniac things, wickedly fanged, jaws slavering.","Thousands of pounds, Thad knew.","For a moment Thad could see great, hooked fangs in that jaw.",Claws were rasping upon the tough fabric of his suit.,"The air must be good, he thought, if the dog could live in it.","Several times it sniffed the air and drew back, snarling.",A shriek so keen and shrill that it seemed to tear out his nerves by their roots.,"The slender spindle of the ship was only a mile away now, bright in the sunlight.","Soon the strain would come upon it, as it checked the momentum of the mass of iron.","*       *       *       *       * It held, though, to his relief.","With a sharp, eager bark, it leaped up at Thad, pawing at his armor and licking it, standing on its hind legs and reaching toward the visor of his helmet.","To his relief, a scrutiny of the dials revealed nothing wrong.",And another sound reached Thad's ears.,The line tightened.,Thad thought that the unpleasant earthy odor he had noticed upon opening the face-plate of his helmet was stronger here.,It was hurled howling to the deck.,"It was incredible ... yet he had seen the dog knocked down, and the bleeding wound it had received.","Thad thought he heard quick, rasping footsteps, then, that were not those of the dog.","And if the flier had been still outside Jupiter's orbit when those words were written, it must have been weeks before the end.","They were neatly in order, and the berths had been made since they were used.",Not the dull black of meteoric iron.,New treasure in the chest would not have surprised him.,"Three times he approached the chest, to lift the lid and find what it held.","He started across the hold, shrinking involuntarily from the armored enormities that seemed crouched to spring at him, motionless eyes staring.","Several times the hinges creaked, and he felt a heavy pressure against the panels.","He flung past the deserted vessel, behind it, his lump of iron swung like a pebble in a sling."
