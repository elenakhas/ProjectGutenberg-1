"The following day I happened to be in Dorking, and was walking through that town, when I heard quick steps behind me, and a voice cry--""Halt: I want you.""","He, it seemed, had carried laces; he had also gridled sacred hymns in the streets, and sung sporting songs in the alehouses; he had even exerted himself as a dancer, ""but,"" said he, ""I must confess, after all, that as a downrighter my profits are larger, at the expenditure of far less energy.""","We were in a far better position than an Italian who was waiting to be tried for murder, and whose cell was not far distant from ours.","Thus what promised to be a summer's outing full of enjoyment, came to a disastrous close sooner than we expected.","In all my life I have never heard a more pathetic address and prayer than that which was delivered by this Captain, on one of these Sunday afternoons.","They could scarcely have been refused in one house, for in less than ten minutes they were both at my side, dropping paper parcels into the empty bag, the mouth of which I held open.","After going out in the morning for two or three hours, I would return at midday, often earlier, and sit hopelessly before this fire for ten or eleven hours, after which I would retire to my room.","From him I learnt that the firm had smashed, no pay day had come, and the stores had all absolutely refused to honour the firm's orders; while some men had left the town disgusted, and others were patiently waiting a settlement that would never come.","A full half hour had elapsed, and Slim had not received one cent, although he had told his pitiful story to a number of people.","""What for?""",he asked.,"CHAPTER IX BERRY PICKING We reached the fruit country a week or two before picking commenced, but although we were in advance of time, and without a cent, the generosity of the farmers supplied all our wants.","""What,"" cried Red, ""go home for good next trip, eh?","He had a large bundle under his arm, but to the surprise and anxiety of his companions, was holding to his nose a blood-stained pocket handkerchief.","Take it down the track to that clump of woods,"" said he, ""for the waiter promised that did I bring a jug or can he would supply me with hot coffee.""","I was always writing at this time, either beginning or finishing a work, but, strange to say, none of this work was being sent out, but was safely treasured, under the impression that it would some day find its market.","This I did at nine o'clock, after which I sat sometimes reading the paper, and again watching the faces of this mixed assembly.","For three days after this operation I hovered between life and death, any breath expected to be my last.","He almost began to despair of success, but firmly resolved not to return without something to show for his trouble.","Seeing this comfortable sight, and being cold and tired, we made up our minds to jump off the train as soon as possible, and to return to that fire for a few hours' comfort.",There is no strain or effort in giving these notes to the world--despite the gridler's affectations--and he neither grows pale nor red with the exertion.,"It was now that superstition took hold of me, and I got off with all possible speed, often looking back to see if I was pursued; and I did not stop until a human settlement lay between me and that accursed park.","""Mr. Davies,"" he said, ""I have received a letter from a lady who has become interested in your case, and wishes to better your conditions.","About an hour and a half had elapsed when we discovered ourselves to be alone in the bar, and without means of procuring more liquor.","This printer placed the MS. in the hands of a good reader, and that gentleman was put to considerable trouble, being baffled and interested in turns.","At this he pricked up his ears, and asked if I had been in a certain town in one of those shires, which I had, and saw no reason to say otherwise.","What a merry lot of beggars were assembled here; and how busy they all seemed to be, making articles for sale, and washing and mending their clothes!","If the landlord, or any one else, had the least suspicion earlier in the morning, it certainly vanished at the sight of this letter.","The season, if I remember right, lasted between three and four weeks, which we began and finished, but were not very well satisfied with the financial result.","These children are rarely subjected to ill usage--except that of enforced tramping--but are more often spoilt by indulgence, especially if they show early signs of that cunning which is needed for their future, and which is the boast of their parents.","This he proceeded to do, very deliberately, I thought.","Perhaps the man was ashamed of his ill-success, and did not care to own his defeat to the conductor and his fellow brakesmen; but whatever was the matter, we rode that train to its destination and without any more interference.","Then came a shout for all men who had signed for the London trip, and, hastily wishing Cockney and others good-bye, I left the office.","My conception of that wonderful land, for all my travels, was childish in the extreme.","""No more have I,"" said he.","Almost in an instant the door was flung wide open, and the sheriff stood in the open way to know their wants.","He kept his promise and I kept mine, for on the fourth day after landing, I wished him good-bye outside his sister's house, which he had had some difficulty in finding.","At the same time another beat the animal about the head with a wooden stake, dangerously near the eyes.",Now when the next morning came there seemed to be a suspicion that all was not right.,"My five weeks' money was due on the following week, so I at once began making preparations for a trip home.","This gentleman kept on the plantation a large general store, and supplied their wants at such an exorbitant price that the negroes were seldom out of debt, when the busy season commenced.","Cockney and myself were on the best of terms, and yet, some time previous to the above episode, he had served me a trick which ought to have severed our friendship for ever.","I thanked him that I had and, as we made our way towards the house, told him I would be thankful for any old clothes to replace my own, which were now stained with blood.","They now marched him from the jail, their strong arms supporting his terror stricken limbs, but no man reviled him with his tongue, and I saw no cowardly hand strike him.","Some of them were of such a prosperous appearance that no doubt I had already passed them in the street, thinking they were either merchants or managers of great concerns; and, more likely than not, the paper boys had followed on their heels, and the cabmen had persistently hailed them.","Only one shot was fired, and that one told.","True, we were all getting drunk fast, but I never thought Cockney would be daring enough to attempt such a deed in our first stage of intoxication.",toot!,Passing boldly through the gates we followed the drive until we saw before us a fine large mansion.,"People never mistake me for a trader, for I exhibit no wares, and tell them straightforward that I am begging the price of my supper and bed.""","I have seen this so often the case that I would much prefer to believe a dirty ragged tramp who might tell me that he had a good home six months previous, than to believe his cleaner namesake, who seems so eager to impart this information unsolicited.","""The Society, no doubt, does a large amount of good,"" continued this gentleman, ""but I don't altogether agree with their methods.","For, thought he, if it does no good, it cannot do any harm.","He was certainly not backward in insulting and threatening Blackey, which made the latter laugh until the tears came into his eyes.","One evening, when the men had finished their day's work, and I was preparing to go on duty for the night, I heard Blacky propose a night's raid on the captain's chickens, which were kept in a small coop under the bridge, and rather difficult to rob, considering the bridge was always occupied by the captain or one of his first officers.","Saying which Brum boldly entered the restaurant, leaving me to wait outside.","Some ten or fifteen men were in this room, some of them busy preparing work for the next day.",Only imagine all these notorious men meeting together haphazard in this manner.,I have been unfortunate all my life in believing that there were a great number of rich people who were only too eager to come forward and help talent in distress.,"Every man I met on the following day enquired where I had lodged during the earthquake shock on the previous night, and that question explained everything.","She saw me returning that same way, and, beginning to play near the water, fall in head first, she, in her dream, just reaching the spot in time to save me.","What a glorious time we had; the people catered for us as though we were the only tramps in the whole world, and as if they considered it providential that we should call at their houses for assistance.","I travelled alone, in spite of the civilities of other tramps, who desired company, so as to allow no strange voice to disturb my dreams.","He shook that red rag of his, and a continuous flow of speech ensued, and the surrounding creatures were mute, but not at all infuriated.","For, as soon as James Macquire put in an appearance, one of the stonemasons abruptly asked when he intended to see the lawyer.","""Now,"" said James Macquire to the landlord, ""you had better let me have some money.""","""We will go ashore,"" he said, ""and see the different towns, and take in fresh provisions as they are needed.""",asked one.,"With ""Brummy"" Tom and his friend for companions, I took a number of long sleeping draughts, and just after twelve o'clock that night was fast asleep in bed.","In the course of conversation Long John informed me that he also was travelling London way, and if I was agreeable we would start together on the following morning.","Following his example, but with more haste, so as to be the first ready, I waited the unbolting of his door, so that I might meet this man face to face.","These horrible and inhuman cries so affected me on one Saturday evening, when, for the sake of the study, I had retired early to bed, that I could neither think, sleep nor lie quiet, and felt compelled to get up and return to the kitchen.",He seemed to be much surprised when I told him it was the town of Plymouth.,"We embarked again, but owing to the young Texan being taken sick with malarial fever, resolved to put ashore for medicine at the first large town.","Of course, this made not the least difference, as many a tramp knew, except that had we been old soldiers the lady not being able to test us by drill, would therefore not have given more than the civilian's shilling.","On the second day out we were all at leisure for an hour or more, and enquiries went around as to who had a pack of cards.","They would certainly find no necessity for defending their privacy, for one glance at these six men, especially in their present condition, would have been sufficient to deter any decent-minded person from entering.","""No,"" I answered, ""a pedlar.""","At last this severe examination was at an end, and we were both led through an iron corridor and placed in a cell, the door of which was carefully locked.",It had run with such a reckless speed that it could not possibly maintain its hold of the rails.,"This train had apparently, through some cause or another, jumped the rails, and the cars had rolled over and over from top to bottom.","Yes, and they could wait, for that was the last of Macquire, and, to the surprise and mortification of the landlord and the two stonemasons, the house received no more visits or letters from lawyers.","It filled me with vexation to think that I was no nearer my object, for I was, comparatively speaking, penniless."
