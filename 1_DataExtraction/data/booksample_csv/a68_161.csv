"""Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?""","He saw her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect.",Domestic happiness is out of the question.,"""I do not know what I told her,"" he replied, impatiently; ""less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future.","Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.","Their being her relations too made it so much the worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put up with one another.","Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in orders already.""","""You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park--it was the evening of a dance--in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some measure, your sister Marianne.""","Mary always has her own way.""","continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, ""I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.""",But they are Lady Middleton's visitors.,"""Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,"" replied Mrs. Palmer;--""Not that I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.",Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise.,"But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.""","They met for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards, or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.","Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty--You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal?""","here comes your beau, Nancy,' my cousin said t'other day, when she saw him crossing the street to the house.","Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all over the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them, where there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the trees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest, had--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.","""Yes,"" he replied gravely, ""once I have.",And the dried cherries too!,"CHAPTER 25 Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not without a settled habitation of her own.","Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.","Marianne, I dare say, will not leave her room again this evening.","To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins' situations in the most delicate particulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.","""These are done by my eldest sister,"" said he; ""and you, as a man of taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them.","I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better.","In such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty, of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude, she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary rambles.","cried Elinor; ""have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door?","and, in some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.""",Know your own happiness.,"Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--"" Elinor stopped him with a reproof.","Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire lately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr. Ferrars, and the kind confidante of himself, talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies, and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.--His behaviour to her in this, as well as in every other particular, his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days, his readiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion, might very well justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment, and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the first, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it herself.","In Bond Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all that interested and occupied the others.","Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen him there.","I only stood at the door, and heard what I could.","Come, come, this won't do, Colonel; so let us hear the truth of it.""",You tell me that she has forgiven me already.,"Elinor, I am miserable, indeed,"" before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.","She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her.","Her husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her objection.","yes, that I do indeed.","Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, ""And have you really, Ma'am, talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?","""Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,"" said she; ""What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mama?","""You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character farther.","A short, a very short time however must now decide what Willoughby's intentions were; in all probability he was already in town.","By whom can he have been instigated?""","I never wish to offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.","I am sure they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.""",Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?,"""Oh, yes, I dare say you will.""","Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account; her daughters might do as they pleased.","Ferrars.""","You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before, it is quite charming!","CHAPTER 14 The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance.","""I can believe it,"" said Elinor; ""but unfortunately he did not feel the same.""","Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost ready to cry out, ""Lord!",said Sir John.,"""Well, Marianne,"" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, ""for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well.","From Cleveland, which was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not beyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at home in little more than three weeks' time.","""And what,"" said Mrs. Dashwood, ""is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest?",It will be all to one a better match for your sister.,"""You are mistaken, Elinor,"" said she warmly, ""in supposing I know very little of Willoughby.","He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think, Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life.""",He then took leave of the whole party.,"Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell me, what is the matter?""","""Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait.","""If you would but let us know what your business is,"" said Mrs. Jennings, ""we might see whether it could be put off or not.""","""Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do.""","""I had not thought of that.","To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother.","Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.","At length Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh, ""I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement.","""Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the deviation is necessary.","""Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.","Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their parties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.","""Is that Fanny's hair?","They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be.","But that was not enough; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them.","cried Margaret, ""how happy I should be!",Mama saw him here once before;--but I was with my uncle at Weymouth.,"This has always been your doctrine, I am sure.""","said his wife, laughing.",She hesitated; she knew not what to do.
