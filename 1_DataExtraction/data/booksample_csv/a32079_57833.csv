"When you talked of things you had done when you were small children, I used to listen hungrily, hoping you might speak of him, but you never did.",There are still men in the village telling what they will do to him when he comes back.” “What was it he did?” Beatrice asked.,"He inspected his patient and announced a very great improvement, and then said he must go on at once, since he hoped to visit the town and start back over the mountain that same day.",She cast aside Dr. Minturn’s advice to let John Herrick make the first move toward reconciliation.,Beatrice and Hester were at the cabin when the two berry pickers returned.,"“Why must we go?” His eyes were looking beyond her at the threatening sky, and that ominous, deeping color of the range opposite.","“When the time comes to act, you will know what to do.” So Dr. Minturn had said, and he had been right.","I wonder how soon help can come.” John Herrick, lying very still among the blankets, made no comment.","The heavy, dark forest seemed to cling, like a blanket, to the lower slopes of the mountains, as though it had slipped away from the smooth rocky shoulders of the heights above.",“You must reach Dr. Minturn’s before dark and I have none too much daylight left to climb my own trail.” Helplessly she stood watching while he caught the horses and saddled them.,Presently she got up to steal into Nancy’s room opposite and see how she was faring.,The two horses were lingering near the fire: she caught their bridles and waited.,Suddenly Olaf glanced over his shoulder and then turned about quickly.,"“I don’t know this gentleman,” she heard Dabney say, staring at Olaf, and she heard Tim reply over his shoulder, “Nor do you need to know him, so far as I can see.” “I heard you talk of going berrying the other day, Miss Nancy,” Olaf said, coming to the door and quite disregarding the inquisitive reporter.",But I think about him now.,“You shall hear of my gratitude later.,"Beatrice had sprained her knee in that perilous moment when she dropped the ax over the mountain-side, but she had scarcely noticed the mishap until, slipping from the saddle at her own door, she found herself unable to walk into the house.",He had only to lift his voice ever so little above the whispers of the forest; he had only to speak her name and the long spell would be broken.,She was aware of Nancy standing in the door and looking at Dabney Mills’ back in round-eyed astonishment.,"With the whole world washed clean, with the dripping water dried up in an hour by the all-conquering sunshine, it seemed that nothing could be more perfect.","“The money for this affair,” Mills went on, “was raised in part, as is usual, by the owners of the land which is to be irrigated, but the greater amount was to be subscribed by capitalists outside the valley, John Herrick pledging himself to see that the necessary sum was forthcoming.","“It is rather a long cake,” she reflected after she had spent an hour combining the ingredients, but she felt certain that the completed dish would amply repay her toil.","I did not want you to hear unless you could see it all as clearly as I did myself.” “And do you think,” asked Beatrice, her voice low and eager, “do you believe that the time has come now?” “Yes,” was the answer, “I think the time has come now.",It was as though her chance coming had done him good.,"With maddening clearness, she could recollect how she had looked out of the window, glanced at one girl’s hair-ribbon, decided she would have a dress like the one in front of her, and with only half her mind had listened to what the lecturer was saying.","‘Such a person could not live a year,’ I declared.","Her mind was full of new, excited hopes that seemed to dance to the music of Buck’s flying feet.","Before they had finished breakfast, there was a loud trampling of hoofs outside, announcing a cavalcade—Hester Herrick on her pinto pony, Dr. Minturn with her, and Olaf riding behind leading a packhorse.","As she became more used to her task, however, she began to see more and more what she could use; the brisk exercise warmed her, and the armfuls of brush that she carried back and heaped up by the tent began to grow encouragingly high.","“To be sure, I will go,” he said.","“We are all very tired of your questions, and think you have no right to ask them.” “Oh, I don’t want to inquire about him,” returned Dabney, indicating Olaf with a jerk of his thumb.","“I would do anything for John Herrick or a friend of his, so that’s all settled.","Did she really come here to—to——” His voice trailed away to a gasping whisper, but Beatrice knew what he wished to ask.",“You spend the whole day here—spend the night too?,"Fascinated, she sat watching, while the moonlight grew clearer and the soft white turned to glistening silver.","“You have taken up rather a large task,” he said slowly; “taken it for the most part upon your own shoulders.","“Why,” she exclaimed, her glance arrested by a photograph hanging near the window, “we have that same picture at home, in my father’s study.",“So do I.,"Would John Herrick’s house soon be closed, and would Hester have to leave them too?",I was in a wild hurry to have Jack come.,"“I would never have thought,” she declared, “that you could curry a horse and split the kindling before breakfast and that I could scrub floors and wash dishes every day and that we both of us would like it.","When they hear that about his past, they may know for sure where to look for their money.” He swung on his heel and was off in haste down the hill.","“Its trunk will burn famously,” she told herself, perhaps to quiet any misgivings she felt concerning the treacherous ground over which she must pass.","For a time there was no doctor in the valley below us here, so I used to do what I could for the sick people in these mountains.","Beatrice, the least enthusiastic seamstress of the three, was the one whose wardrobe needed the most repair, since her scrambles over the mountains had wrought more ruin than she had realized.","And how can I ever thank you for—for everything?” There was a curious wistfulness in the look that John Herrick bent upon her, and a great kindness also.","“We have been guessing who you were, but we didn’t mean to pry into any secrets.” “It does not matter,” he assured her.","He shot the bear himself last winter,” she said when the girls protested that this last gift was too great a one.","“I wanted to suggest,” John Herrick went on slowly, “that there is a doctor who lives on the other side of Gray Cloud Mountain, a man who does not practise now, but who has been a famous specialist for just such illness.","“Have I not enough to blame myself for, without having to see some terrible thing happen to you here on this cruel mountain?","“There is one thing more,” he began.","He would come to see her if I asked him, for he has always been a good friend to me.","“Those engineers who used the place just settled down to make themselves comfortable,” Christina explained.","Up and up they went, through forest, across clearings, fording the noisy shallows of the stream that was their guide, scrambling across the faces of rocky slopes where Buck picked his way as warily as a cat.",It rendered her task of living by no means easier to realize that she had made an enemy of such a man as Thorvik.,"Indeed, I doubt if she knows it herself.","How soon do you think help will come?” “It will come soon,” her sister answered confidently.",He leaned far out over the precipice and looked down.,It was addressed to Dr. Minturn and told where they were and how desperate was their need.,"By midnight the final log would be burned, the last bundle of brush would have gone up in windswept sparks.","Beatrice walked down with him through the pines, for he had tied his horse at the gate.",“That boy who has been helping Tim is Christina’s son Olaf.,We saw each other little and were always tired when our daily duties were done.,"“Oh, my cake, my cake!” she cried in distress.","Olaf had been carrying it on his arm when he heard Nancy’s frantic cry for help, and he had never thought of setting it down, nor did he spill quite all of the contents as he ran to help her.","Here she had learned new things, had felt new strength, had begun to play a part in the real affairs of life.","He is not such a pony as Buck, I admit, but he will carry you safely enough.",It is the only one I know of.,"Once she struck, and again, then heard the preliminary crack that signaled the surrender of the tough old tree.","“‘Yes, but could he offer material proof that it was the contractor, and he alone, who had been pocketing the money?’ “No, he had no proof, so far.","But Christina came out and closed the door, the bright morning was calling, and Beatrice forgot her curiosity in looking forward to her ride.","He asked me a great many impudent questions, but he happened to mention that he had seen Thorvik going in through your gate.","“There wasn’t anything more you wanted them to do, was there?” “Oh, I wanted them to mail my letters,” exclaimed Beatrice, seizing her envelopes and jumping up.","“But look-a-here,” Dabney Mills burst out, “if she’s his sister and he’s your uncle, why did you never let on to any one?","In the midst of her wild preparations, however, there was a step on the stair and Aunt Anna came slowly down, looking very white and frightened.","Minturn and his wife are very fond of my Hester, and she often rides over to visit them.","They sat there even after they were dry, but finally Hester, with a sigh, declared they must go.","When the account was finished, he had various things to ask, often with long pauses for rest between the words.","Christina had given her a Scandinavian recipe, dwelling so much on the unusual deliciousness of the result that Nancy could scarcely wait to try it.","Now the men are lounging around town, idle, quarreling, looking for trouble.","Since she was unwilling that the stranger should come in, for fear he would disturb and annoy Aunt Anna, and since he made no move to go away, she finally sat down herself upon the step.","“There are only twenty minutes now,” Beatrice urged.",He wanted to know if I could be happy in some other place if he decided not to live here any longer.
