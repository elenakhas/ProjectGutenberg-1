and it was lucky that I got that way this time, or I might have missed the Zen.","Take over.""","What I had already said to it were stock phrases that Yurt had taught me; I knew still more, but I couldn't speak Zennacai fluently by any means.","She had been alone for three thousand years, on a chip of bone from her dead world beneath a sepulchre of stars.","mn?""","I realized that here was only a sick girl, no tiny monster.","Five hundred years, Eert-mn--not too long.","Then I said, ""Yes,"" realizing that the nod wasn't visible through the one-way glass of my helmet.","From the coloring, I knew this Zen was a female.","""This--what we are on--was part of Sorn, I know.","Maybe that, I thought, was what evolution always worked toward.",I can't even hurt myself.,"Why do I want you to kill me?""","It came a little closer, actually, and peered up at my helmeted, mirror-glassed head--unmistakably the seat of intelligence, it appears, of any race anywhere.",It took me a couple of seconds to untangle the squeaking syllables and get any sense out of them.,"Its mouth, almost human-shaped, worked; finally words came.","""I am not a Zen,"" I told her, giving my torch full brilliance for the crew's sake, ""but Yurt here is.","I told her that the Zen had been, all evidence indicated, the toughest, hardest, longest-lived creatures God had ever cooked up: practically independent of their environment, no special ecological niche;
