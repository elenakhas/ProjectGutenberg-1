said Cheriton.,"It is true that they thought Gipsy's free intercourse with their cousin Alvar and with the English stranger shocking; but they preferred them to any other subject of conversation, and Isabel in particular made quite a romance of the incident of the Cape Jessamine, and how Don Cherito had looked at her when he gave it to her.",Over!,"In spite of all their efforts, a great part had been burnt, and the rest much injured by the water used to put out the fire.","""Of course,"" said Jack, ""it is all right.""","The prisoners were very well guarded, and though Alvar made more than one attempt to converse with the captain, he got scarcely any answer.","Ruth looked at him with reproach in her eyes, but they had no chance then of obtaining private words.",I did not know the little dog was yours.,"You did not help me by calling up the dragon slayer's look.""","I wanted to tell you I shall be very glad to do anything to help you, if you will allow me.""","""But, Queenie,"" said Ruth cautiously, using a pet name of Virginia's girlhood, ""surely you _were_ told how tumbledown the place was, and how stupid and behindhand everything would be.","""I think there is a great effort to avoid any want of respect in the letter.""","English ""business"" was unintelligible to Alvar without his explanations, and though the new Squire showed himself perfectly willing to receive from Mr Malcolm an account of the various sources of his income, and submitted to go through his father's accounts, and to hear reports from farmers and bailiffs, he always insisted on Cheriton's presence at these interviews; and though he was too easily satisfied with the fact that ""my brother understands,"" no one could have expected him to find it all quite easy to understand himself.",What can I do?,"He just managed to get back to the house and into the library, where Jack started up, as he threw himself into a chair.","""The train comes in at five--we had better send, hadn't we?""","""For my part, I think the fruit market is the nicest place here; it has such a splendid view.","""Don't think about me,"" repeated Cheriton rather stiffly.","It was sometimes breezy, for Rupert loved to tease his betrothed, and having got his will, was a free-and-easy and contented lover, not much liking to be put out of his way, and not quite coming up to Ruth's requirements.","It is a mark, doubtless, of my father's politics; but at home--well, I can smoke, if that is better?""","He had not been at Milford since the day of the great rejoicing, when Cheriton, with all his fresh honours, had met them there, had wooed, and, as he thought, won Ruth Seyton; when he himself was Virginia's acknowledged lover.",Virginia sat still where he had left her.,"said Cherry, turning into his room, ""it's all hopeless and miserable.","""Thank Heaven for His great mercy!""","""Sir, I obey my father's commands.","He was attractive to her beyond measure, he occupied every corner of her heart; it was joy to her to be near him; his gentle, chivalrous courtship gave her unimaginable delight.","Cheriton liked the ladies, who were kind, and possessed many domestic virtues; and at Don Guzman's country place there was something exceedingly pleasant in the cheerfulness and gaiety of the peasants.","An indefinite haze of questions pervaded Cheriton's mind, and as he reckoned over the county beauties whom he could introduce to Alvar, and whom he would surely admire more than just the one particular beauty who had first occurred to his thoughts, he reached the house.","""Mine _never_ shall,"" said Nettie emphatically.","You will find others.""",CHAPTER TWENTY SIX.,FIRE AND SNOW.,"She felt profoundly miserable, so wretched that she could hardly keep the tears out of her eyes.","It was a small half-length in tinted chalk showing Cherry seated and looking up, with a bright interested face, at Alvar, who was showing him a branch of pomegranates.","""I am glad to hear it,"" she said.","I don't think he was expected to live at first, and, poor fellow!","""No, I'll not have it done.",Nor could she help perceiving that he scarcely ever occupied himself with anything more useful than a cigar.,"Ha, ha, I must set about learning the catechism myself.",Here and there-- it is the same thing.,"Being absent, she could venture to soften at the thought of him, and cried for him many a time in secret.","He was quite ready, however, to be excited and patriotic as they passed through the famous waters of Trafalgar, and curious to taste sherry at Xeres, where it proved exceedingly bad.","""Of course,"" said Alvar, with a curious accent, half-proud, half-tender, as he laid his hand on Cheriton's.","Ruth sat quite still; she would have yielded at a word, perhaps--in a minute more she might even have made the first advance to a reconciliation.","""I don't think I could ever make you understand it, Ruth.",But it is not quite so.,"It is not _that_.""","""Yes, but I'm going to Oxford next week.""","Nettie, after all, had rejoiced in the partners of which her white frock and plaited hair had not defrauded her (she never should forgive her hair for coming down in Rupert's very sight in the last waltz).",I am myself.,"Send away Monsieur Alvar; we can't do without you.""","""I knew not how to speak to her.","""But my grandmother will stay here,"" said Alvar, in a tone of surprise.","said Alvar, taking her hand.",What could a chit of a lass like you do for them?,"I could struggle with you both.""","""Yes, a little; but Cheriton is like an angel, though he will not have me say so; but Rupert, he has the devil in his face.","said Cheriton roughly, his indignation again gaining ground.","""Nettie, where are you going?""","you in whose right hands        Our own rests calm, whose faithful hearts all day,   Wide open, wait till back from distant lands        Thought, the tired traveller, wends his homeward way.""",Let the insolent boy have a few weeks more of suspense; what did it matter?,"""I think you are tired with London--you see too many people.""","""It is that to you--as to my father I am a stranger,"" said Alvar.","It was not often that Cheriton's native skies were so cloudless, nor were these hot, full summer days at all typical of the home that he loved so well.","Go and show her that you really care for her as she deserves, and it will all come right.",how hatefully selfish she was to think of it!,"Dearest, don't use such hard words of yourself.","Moreover, the way in which some of the excellent old dependents showed their loyalty to the old _regime_, was by doing nothing without orders.",The promise you had the prudence to exact has been unbroken.,she persisted.,Granny always said I was a gossip.,"It's a very unworthy weakness, I know, but I can't help it.""","""I feel all the force of the compliment.",He did not spend the time of his walk in forming any plans as to how he should meet Ruth;
