"""Relate the circumstances of this man's death,"" said the coroner.","Suddenly, we heard, at a little distance to our right, and partly in front, a noise as of some animal thrashing about in the bushes, which we could see were violently agitated.",I can judge from his manner if he thinks me mad.,"Some of the jurors who had risen to get a better view repented their curiosity, and turned away their faces.","""You knew the deceased, Hugh Morgan?""","He was silent for some moments, his eyes upon the floor.",The coroner smiled.,He seemed a good model for a character in fiction.,"""I was about to speak further, when I observed the wild oats near the place of the disturbance moving in the most inexplicable way.","Before the smoke of the discharge had cleared away I heard a loud savage cry--a scream like that of a wild animal--and, flinging his gun upon the ground, Morgan sprang away and ran swiftly from the spot.","The coroner moved round to the end of the table and undid a silk handkerchief, which had been passed under the chin and knotted on the top of the head.","It was as if something had passed along between me and them; but I could not see it, and the stars were not thick enough to define its outline.",Some of the jurors laughed.,"""Sept.",He trembled visibly.,At last he ran away into the brush as fast as he could go.,.,"Inexpressibly terrified, I struggled to my feet and looked in the direction of Morgan's retreat; and may heaven in mercy spare me from another sight like that!",Against a sombre background humor shows high lights.,"It seemed as if stirred by a streak of wind, which not only bent it, but pressed it down--crushed it so that it did not rise, and this movement was slowly prolonging itself directly toward us.","""Yes.""","Your duty has been already explained to you; if there is nothing you wish to ask you may go outside and consider your verdict.""","All were torn, and stiff with blood.","'You are not going to fill up a deer with quail-shot, are you?'","Harker started to leave, but paused, with his hand on the door latch.",I said.,"IV In the diary of the late Hugh Morgan are certain interesting entries having, possibly, a scientific value as suggestions.",'I wish we had brought a rifle.',"The foreman seated himself near the candle, produced from his breast pocket a pencil and scrap of paper, and wrote rather laboriously the following verdict, which with various degrees of effort all signed: ""We, the jury, do find that the remains come to their death at the hands of a mountain lion, but some of us thinks, all the same, they had fits.""",You seemed greatly interested in it; you read in it while I was testifying.,His voice was husky and unnatural.,"""'We've started a deer,' said.","""But you say it is incredible.""","I sometimes write stories.""","""What asylum did this yer last witness escape from?""","""Before I could get upon my feet and recover my gun, which seemed to have been struck from my hands, I heard Morgan crying out as if in mortal agony, and mingling with his cries were such hoarse savage sounds as one hears from fighting dogs.","""Yes.""","""Morgan, who had stopped and was intently watching the agitated chaparral, said nothing, but had cocked both barrels of his gun, and was holding it in readiness to aim.",Do odors impress some olfactory centre with images of the thing emitting them?,"He turned about and said: ""The book that you have there--I recognize it as Morgan's diary.",The witness was sworn.,As Harker passed out of the house the jury reentered and stood about the table on which the now covered corpse showed under the sheet with sharp definition.,"""I was visiting him at this place to shoot and fish.","No, this is _my_ house, my land.","He was dead.""","We were looking for quail, each with a shotgun, but we had only one dog.",I used manifold paper and have a copy of what I sent.,"""'What is it?",The other arm was invisible.,"Witness Harker went to the open window and leaned out across the sill, faint and sick.","""I am sorry to have kept you,"" he said.","II ""...The sun had hardly risen when we left the house.","he replied, without turning his head.","""Nothing that I had ever seen had affected me so strangely as this unfamiliar and unaccountable phenomenon, yet I am unable to recall any sense of fear.","""I went away, not to evade your summons, but to post to my newspaper an account of what I suppose I am called back to relate.""","All sounds had ceased, but, with a feeling of such terror as even these awful events had not inspired, I now saw the same mysterious movement of the wild oats prolonging itself from the trampled area about the prostrate man toward the edge of a wood.","Soldiers in the intervals of battle laugh easily, and a jest in the death chamber conquers by surprise.","I remember--and tell it here because, singularly enough, I recollected it then--that once, in looking carelessly out of an open window, I momentarily mistook a small tree close at hand for one of a group of larger trees at a little distance away.","On the other side was comparatively level ground, thickly covered with wild oats.","So now the apparently causeless movement of the herbage, and the slow, undeviating approach of the line of disturbance were distinctly disquieting.","His right arm was lifted and seemed to lack the hand--at least, I could see none.","God hates a coward.... ""Oct.","I thought at first that he had gone mad, but on returning to the house found no other alteration in his manner than what was obviously due to fear of punishment.","I watched again all of last night in the same cover, gun in hand, double-charged with buckshot.","A part of my purpose, however, was to study him, and his odd, solitary way of life.",When the handkerchief was drawn away it exposed what had been the throat.,I asked.,"My companion appeared actually frightened, and I could hardly credit my senses when I saw him suddenly throw his gun to his shoulders and fire both barrels at the agitated grass!","They had, in truth, seen all this before; the only thing that was new to them being Harker's testimony.","Then I understood that we had serious business on hand, and my first conjecture was that we had 'jumped' a grizzly.","We so rely upon the orderly operation of familiar natural laws that any seeming suspension of them is noted as a menace to our safety, a warning of unthinkable calamity.",The chest and sides looked as if they had been beaten with a bludgeon.,I can hardly describe it.,Ugh!,May I see it?,"It looked the same size as the others, but, being more distinctly and sharply defined in mass and detail, seemed out of harmony with them.",The witness understood.,Before I could reach his side he was down and quiet.,"The foreman rose--a tall, bearded man of sixty, coarsely clad.",The coroner was apparently not greatly affected by the young man's manifest resentment.,"""'That Damned Thing!'","Each was eclipsed but an instant, and only a few at the same time, but along the entire length of the ridge all that were within a degree or two of the crest were blotted out.",III The coroner rose from his seat and stood beside the dead man.
