"The moon lights it with its blue radiance._       [_On the right, MERLIN is seated on the great marble       bed.","Here are my hands, my forehead, my hair, my shoulder.... And here are my kisses, which yours recognize!...","They say he has a son who is very far from here, who is lost, perhaps....","JOYZELLE,       anxious, dishevelled, is busying herself around him._ JOYZELLE.","No, the dead are horrible, if they want us to love those whom we do not love.... LANCÉOR.",I would gladly exchange all the joys that I have known in my poor life for the most cruel of those happy sorrows.... (_He leans over JOYZELLE._) Arielle spoke truly.,And your own meets mine in the first kiss that passes between our lips to unite our destinies....,(_Taking JOYZELLE in his arms._) Joyzelle!...,"Go, father, go....","It is he alone, it is you alone, in whom no change can come but that which increases love....",But do not be surprised: I have wept so long and so desperately that the tears still rise in spite of myself.... Joy was so far away that it could not return with the first kisses....,What?,I am hurt.... An adder has stung me.... JOYZELLE.,"When one loves as I love you, she is blind and deaf, because she looks beyond and listens elsewhere....","Have a care, she approaches and will win your heart!...",Did she call you?...,"Here are the violet, which has lost its perfume, the trembling, shrinking buttercup and the scarlet poppy, which sheds its petals without ceasing....","When you came in, I did not hesitate, I went up to you, I asked you to snatch from death the only man I love; and yet I knew that you love me too....",LANCÉOR.,JOYZELLE.,"No, it is impossible!...",JOYZELLE.,Go away!...,And yet I fear it....,"I leave you to yourself, face to face with your duty, face to face with your destiny....","I have lost the confidence in which all my thoughts surrounded your thoughts, even as a transparent water surrounds a still clearer water....","If you do not go away, then I shall go.","Withdraw, Joyzelle: you will not be betraying him; you will be warding off death.... JOYZELLE.","I myself no longer believe in it, I no longer believe in myself; I have nothing pure left into which you can bend to find my shadow; and my soul is even sadder than my body.... JOYZELLE.",LANCÉOR.,"No, Joyzelle, and soon proofs and facts will show you that it is not enough and that an honest look, an innocent smile and ingenuous words often conceal more dangerous snares than those of thankless old age or of love that has but little hope.... JOYZELLE.",I hear his voice....       [_LANCÉOR hides behind a cluster of tall spurges.,"They used to open, to laugh, to welcome life.... Now they blink and their glances avoid me like the glances of a knave.... Not a thing remains to me of what I was; my mother would pass by me and not see me....","(_Swooning._) Lancéor, I am mad, or else we are going to die.... LANCÉOR.",How can you believe that Joyzelle would ever be the cause of a tear or the cause of a shadow?...,You would not obey?...,"I see nothing and I shall not raise my mad eyes to the bed until the moment when the thing.... (_She advances with a mechanical step to the foot of the bed._) Now, fate itself shall say yes.... (_She lifts the lamp, looks at the bed, sees MERLIN sleeping and, in her surprise, takes a step back._) He sleeps!...","No, there is something that is mocking our strength....",Where is he?,MERLIN.,"Yes, yes, I knew he had spells at his command....",Enter ARIELLE._ ARIELLE.,"It must be true, it is fate, it is a good and just fate that delivers him to me thus....","And yet, as he is asleep, I cannot know.... Perhaps he has pity, perhaps he renounces and would bid me go!...",Watch and be quick and strong....,LANCÉOR.,Look!...,Because he is myself.... MERLIN.,"If I learn that you have seen each other, you are irrevocably lost.... (_To LANCÉOR._) Do you promise to fly from her?",Look!...,LANCÉOR.,What!...,I had not foreseen....,JOYZELLE.,What will happen if he yields?...,JOYZELLE.,How should I love her?...,I watched his departure from the top of that tower in which I am a prisoner....,What?...,"As it is, you have done too much.... LANCÉOR.",I refuse!...,"Look me in the face.... Do you love her, since you lie like that?...","Nevertheless, Joyzelle, chance may bring you again in this man's presence.",Do you know him?,"It may be that he will take from me more than I have left and that I shall fall dead beside the rival whom I shall have restored to life.... Time was when I would thus risk my existence to save a stranger by the wayside, almost without hesitating and without asking anything in exchange....","One must have held her in his arms to know what treasures of hope, what torrents of certainty issue from the least word murmured by her lips, from the slightest smile that plays upon her face....",You did not love me!...,Why?,"(_Going to another mirror._) For here is another that says the same thing ... unless they all lie, even as everything seems to lie and to mock at me in this extraordinary island.",Do not raise your voice to interrupt a crime which you do not wish to see....,Let us speak no more of the dead.... You have not told me how your shipwreck.... JOYZELLE.,I went down and down.... Then some one caught hold of me and I lost consciousness.... LANCÉOR.,Joyzelle!...,"(_Casting a bewildered glance around her._) Nothing bursts, nothing falls and I am alone in the world!...","You, beside him; you, in his clothes and under his aspect: ah, it is as though death pretended to be life!...","I must see her.... She is turning round and one of her bare breasts, peeping through her tresses, adds rays to the rays that strike it.... She is listening, she hears; and her wide-open eyes are questioning the roses.... She has seen me, she hides herself, she is going to fly.... (_Passing through the hedge._) No, no, do not fly from me!...",But where are the remnants of our love?,JOYZELLE.,JOYZELLE.,[_A pause._ MERLIN.,There will be no appeal.,JOYZELLE.,Joyzelle!...
