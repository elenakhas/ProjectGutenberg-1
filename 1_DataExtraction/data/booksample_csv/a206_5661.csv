He was asleep at his post of duty.,"Druse withdrew his eyes from the valley and fixed them again upon the group of man and horse in the sky, and again it was through the sights of his rifle.",His extended right hand loosely grasped his rifle.,Clearly they have passed this way in thousands; they have not withdrawn by the country roads.,"The feeling was dispelled by a slight movement of the group: the horse, without moving its feet, had drawn its body slightly backward from the verge; the man remained immobile as before.","Not a word is spoken; the populous depths of the forest still murmur with their unseen and unseeing swarm, but all along the fringe there is silence absolute.","But firing is infectious--and see how rapidly he moves, with never a pause except as he whirls his horse about to take a new direction, never directly backward toward us, never directly forward toward his executioners.",Ah!,He could not hope to capture that enemy; to alarm him would but send him dashing to his camp with his fatal news.,"But in this case they will answer in the affirmative with all their lives; the enemy, crouching in double ranks behind the stone wall and in cover of the hedge, will wait until it is possible to count each assailant's teeth.","He sees the human current flowing on either side of him and his huddled escort, like tide waves parted by a rock.","Your mother, as the physician has informed you, is in a most critical condition; at the best, she cannot be with us longer than a few weeks, but that time is precious.","Its motions were those of a wild gallop, but even as the officer looked they ceased, with all the legs thrown sharply forward as in the act of alighting from a leap.","This open ground looked hardly larger than an ordinary dooryard, but was really several acres in extent.","The father lifted his leonine head, looked at the son a moment in silence, and replied: ""Well, go, sir, and, whatever may occur, do what you conceive to be your duty.",It is necessary to know.,"Away beyond it rose a line of giant cliffs similar to those upon which we are supposed to stand in our survey of the savage scene, and through which the road had some how made its climb to the summit.",He can safely ride into the hostile ranks and become a prisoner of war.,"It would be better not to disturb her.""","Flag after flag of ours emerges from the wood, line after line sweeps forth, catching the sunlight on its burnished arms.",The rock capped a high cliff; a stone dropped from its outer edge would have fallen sheer downward one thousand feet to the tops of the pines.,His hands were concealed in the cloud of the horse's lifted mane.,He now removes his field-glass from his eyes and glances to the right and left.,To halt is to withdraw.,At what a dear rate an army must sometimes purchase knowledge!,"Their hope was to surprise it, for the road led to the rear of it.","The skirmishers, without orders, against orders, are going forward at a keen run, like hounds unleashed.",The natural and customary thing to do is to send forward a line of skirmishers.,His home was but a few miles from where he now lay.,They are up and away!,He is deadly pale.,"We have moved forward across his earthworks, across which we have so often vainly attempted to move before, through the debris of his abandoned camps, among the graves of his fallen, into the woods beyond.","He was the son of wealthy parents, an only child, and had known such ease and cultivation and high living as wealth and taste were able to command in the mountain country of Western Virginia.",Its green was more vivid than that of the inclosing forest.,"At some distance away to his right it presented a clean, vertical profile against a background of blue sky to a point half the way down, and of distant hills hardly less blue, thence to the tops of the trees at its base.","The officer rose to his feet, trembling.","I am going to join it.""","One morning he had risen from the breakfast table and said, quietly but gravely: ""Father, a Union regiment has arrived at Grafton.","At nightfall they would take to the road again, climb to the place where their unfaithful sentinel now slept, and, descending the other slope of the ridge, fall upon a camp of the enemy at about midnight.","No country is so wild and difficult but men will make it a theater of war; concealed in the forest at the bottom of that military rat-trap, in which half a hundred men in possession of the exits might have starved an army to submission, lay five regiments of Federal infantry.","The wood is alive with them, and full of confused noises: the occasional rattle of wheels as a battery of artillery goes into position to cover the advance; the hum and murmur of the soldiers talking; a sound of innumerable feet in the dry leaves that strew the interspaces among the trees; hoarse commands of officers.",It might well have made him giddy to look.,"The sunshine rests upon his shoulder-straps, lovingly, like a visible benediction.","But that is now hopeless; he must make the best use of the few minutes of life remaining to him, by compelling the enemy himself to tell us as much and as plainly as possible--which, naturally, that discreet power is reluctant to do.",But this was a flight!,"He means, if not killed, to ride through and overlook the country beyond.","An open country to right and left and forward; behind, a wood.","An officer of the Federal force, who, in a spirit of adventure or in quest of knowledge, had left the hidden bivouac in the valley, and, with aimless feet, had made his way to the lower edge of a small open space near the foot of the cliff, was considering what he had to gain by pushing his exploration further.","He is not alone--he draws all souls after him; we are but ""dead men all.""","Should we both live to the end of the war, we will speak further of the matter.","It is a sign to us, to the world, to posterity.","So long as he advances, the line will not fire,--why should it?",Ten thousand pairs of eyes are fixed upon him with an intensity that he can hardly fail to feel; ten thousand hearts keep quick time to the inaudible hoof-beats of his snowy steed.,And the horse and its rider?,"Those of us who have been out of place resume our positions; the men resting at ease straighten themselves, and the ranks are reformed without a command.",The angle where the soldier lay was on another spur of the same cliff.,"It was not for long; in another moment his face was raised from earth, his hands resumed their places on the rifle, his forefinger sought the trigger; mind, heart and eyes were clear, conscience and reason sound.","Lifting his eyes to the dizzy altitude of its summit, the officer saw an astonishing sight--a man on horseback riding down into the valley through the air!","You are not to forget the nature of this man's act; it is not permitted to you to think of it as an instance of bravado, nor, on the other hand, a needless sacrifice of self.",W. C. Morrow.,"The duty of the soldier was plain: the man must be shot dead from ambush--without warning, without a moment's spiritual preparation, with never so much as an unspoken prayer, he must be sent to his account.",Among the trees--what?,"In case of failure, their position would be perilous in the extreme; and fail they surely would, should accident or vigilance apprise the enemy of the movement.",The familiar sensation of an abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties.,It is a fashion; it seems to dignify the act; we are all addicted to it.,"True, a single rifle-shot might drop him and be no great disclosure.","Not a rifleman in those crouching ranks, not a cannoneer at those masked and shotted guns, but knows the needs of the situation, the imperative duty of forbearance.",It is a hero's salute to death and history.,It may well be that his fixity of attention---Druse turned his head and looked through the deeps of air downward as from the surface of the bottom of a translucent sea.,"Yes, they are up and away.",From the edge of the wood leading up the acclivity are the tracks of horses and wheels--the wheels of cannon.,what would we not give to be in his place--with his soul!,He reins up within a respectful distance of the corps commander and salutes.,But no--there is a hope; he may have discovered nothing; perhaps he is but admiring the sublimity of the landscape.,"Again the spell is broken; our men attempt to cheer; they are choking with emotion; they utter hoarse, discordant cries; they clutch their weapons and press tumultuously forward into the open.",Again he directs his eyes forward; they slowly traverse that malign and awful crest.,Tra-la-la!,"At the salient of that second angle was a large flat rock, jutting out northward, overlooking the deep valley from which the road ascended.","But if detected he would be dead shortly afterward, that being the just and legal penalty of his crime.","The spectators suppose the sudden deflection to be caused by a shot, perhaps a wound; but take this field-glass and you will observe that he is riding toward a break in the wall and hedge.","For this powerful army, moving in battle order through a forest, has met with a formidable obstacle--the open country.",With what careless grace he sits his horse!,"Two or three aides detach themselves from the group and canter away into the woods, along the lines in each direction."
