"To their surprise, protons were knocked out of the paraffin.",But by Einstein’s equation all that energy is equivalent to only a little over a millionth of a gram.,Chadwick managed to work out the mass of the neutron from his experiments and by 1934 it was quite clear that the neutron was more massive than the proton.,"The German physicist Walther Wilhelm Georg Bothe (1891-1957) and a co-worker, H. Becker, were bombarding the light metal, beryllium, with alpha particles.","This hydrogen nucleus had a single positive charge, one that was exactly equal in size to the negative charge on the electron.","However, Aston and his mass spectrometer kept measuring the mass of different nuclei more and more closely during the 1920s and found that they differed very slightly from whole numbers.",There was one way of getting around this and this was explained in 1935 by the American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967) and by his student Melba Phillips.,This instrument was called a “cyclotron”.,"On the other hand, suppose you have lithium-7, which was thought to be made up of 7 protons and 4 electrons.",[Illustration: _C.,The proton-neutron theory was therefore accepted and remains accepted to this day.,"In the end, if enough energy is gained, the proton could do more damage than the alpha particle, despite the former’s smaller mass.",The fact that the neutron was just about as massive as the proton was to be expected if the neutron were a proton-electron combination.,The proton-electron theory was only a theory.,The result was to combine part of the alpha particle with the aluminum-27 nucleus to form a new nucleus with an atomic number two units higher—15—and a mass number three units higher—30.,Suppose we consider the neutrons as proton-electron combinations.,"Twelve separate protons would have a total mass of twelve times that, or 12.0939.",The loss of mass in radioactive changes was found to match the production of energy in just the way Einstein predicted.,[Illustration: _J.,"The manner of radioactive breakdown fits the theory, too.","For more complicated nuclei, additional neutrons are needed.","New nuclei were produced that had _more_ energy than the starting nuclei, so that energy was absorbed by the nuclear reaction rather than given off.",All the spins would cancel each other.,This was in accordance with observation.,"Nevertheless, that enormous energy change in the radioactive breakdown represented only about one-half of 1% of the total energy to which the mass of the uranium atom was equivalent.",The smallest nucleus found was that produced by knocking the single electron off a hydrogen atom in one way or another.,"The droplets, the bubbles, and the light can all be detected one way or another and the path of the subatomic particle could be followed by the trail of ions it left behind.","[Illustration: _Walther W. G. Bothe_] To try to determine something about the properties of this radiation, Bothe and Becker tried putting objects in the way of the radiation.","Since this mass is intermediate between that of an electron and proton, such particles eventually came to be called “mesons” from a Greek word meaning “intermediate”.","Indeed, the surprise was that radioactive changes gave off as little energy as they did.","For instance, suppose the helium nucleus is made up of 4 protons and 2 electrons, as was thought in the 1920s.","And until it was found, the proton-electron theory of nuclear structure, whatever its obvious deficiencies with respect to nuclear spin, remained the only one to work with.",This was the first time in history that the atomic nucleus was altered by deliberate human act.,"Subatomic particles could be detected in a variety of ways, but every single way (right down to the present time) makes use of their electric charge.","In that case the nuclear spin would be 3, either in one direction or the other.","To get hydrogen-sparkling out of the bombardment of nitrogen, Rutherford felt, he must have knocked protons out of the nitrogen nuclei.",It is for this reason that gravitational and electromagnetic interactions can make themselves felt over millions of miles of space.,In 1924 the Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) worked out a theory that treated protons and electrons as though they were spinning on their axes.,"In ordinary bodies, the attractions and repulsions usually cancel each other entirely or nearly entirely, leaving very little of one or the other to be detected as surplus.","Measured in terms of this natural unit of spin, the proton and the electron have spin ½.","If it were made up of 4 protons, it ought to have an electric charge of +4.","[Illustration: _Werner Heisenberg_] The proton-neutron theory of nuclear structure could account for isotopes perfectly well, too.",Suppose a beta particle is emitted.,Yet a fixed number of protons turned out to have different masses if they were first considered separately and then as part of a nucleus.,"D. Anderson_] In 1947, however, the English physicist Cecil Frank Powell (1903-1969) and his co-workers, also studying cosmic-particle bombardment, located another intermediate-sized body, which had the right mass and all the other appropriate properties to fit Yukawa’s theories.",What happens to this difference of 0.007825 between the proton in isolation and the proton as part of a carbon-12 nucleus?,The nuclei that serve as their targets are so unimaginably small that most of the bombarding particles are sure to miss.,The more massive nuclei are all radioactive.,"There are now, at this time of writing, “proton synchrotrons” (descendants of that first cyclotron) that produce particles with over a million times the energy of those produced by Lawrence’s first cyclotron.","Ordinary chemical reactions, with the electron shifts that accompany them, involve the electromagnetic interaction only.","Using modern standards, the mass of a proton is 1.007825.","That nucleus, often called a “deuteron”, is made up of 1 proton plus 1 neutron and has a mass number of 2 and an atomic number of 1.","Their device, called an “electrostatic accelerator”, produced protons that were sufficiently energetic to initiate nuclear reactions.","Was it possible that an electron and a proton, forced into the close confinement of the atomic nucleus might, by the force of mutual attraction, become so intimately connected as to count as a single particle.","Of the 4 protons, suppose that two had a spin of +½ and two of -½.","Suppose also that of the 2 electrons, one had a spin of +½ and one of -½.","By the time you have gigantic masses such as the earth or the sun, the gravitational interaction between them and other bodies is also gigantic.","Within many nuclei, the neutrons are quite stable and do not break up as they do in isolation.","In that case, protons in virtual contact, as within the nucleus, would attract each other, but if the distance between them was increased sufficiently to place one outside the nucleus, the nuclear interaction would decrease in intensity to less than the electromagnetic repulsion.","Neutron Bombardment As soon as neutrons were discovered, it seemed to physicists that they had another possible bombarding particle of extraordinary properties.",In 1911 the Austrian physicist Victor Francis Hess (1883-1964) had discovered that earth was bombarded from every side by “cosmic rays”.,[Illustration: ENERGY CREATED compared to MATTER (OR MASS) DESTROYED] It is this vast difference between the tiny quantity of mass and the huge amount of energy to which it is equivalent that obscured the relationship over the years.,These charged particles had to be energetic to overcome the repulsion of the nucleus and to smash into it with enough force to break it up.,"For more and more massive nuclei, the positive charge grew higher and the repulsion stronger until for elements beyond potassium, no collision could be forced, even with the most energetic naturally occurring alpha particles.",No temperatures available to the physicists of the 1920s could force atoms to smash together hard enough to reach and shake the nucleus.,"It seemed reasonable, then, to suppose that a nucleus would contain about half as many electrons in addition to the protons.","_More and more electrons seemed to be required._ Finally, when the total number of protons was 84 or more, no amount of electrons seemed sufficient to stabilize the nucleus.","In either case, electrons are knocked off atoms that are encountered by the speeding subatomic particle.","It was, in fact, by such an experiment that he first demonstrated the existence of such nuclei.",[Illustration: _Hideki Yukawa_] [Illustration: _Victor F. Hess_] [Illustration: _C.,"This came about first in 1934, when a French husband-and-wife team of physicists, Frédéric Joliot-Curie (1900-1958) and Irène Joliot-Curie (1897-1956) were bombarding aluminum-27 (atomic number 13) with alpha particles.",The mass-energy equivalence fully explained why the atom should contain so great a store of energy.,"Since it has a unit positive charge, it can be accelerated just as an isolated proton can be.","Until the discovery of the neutron, only two kinds of forces, or “interactions”, were known in the universe.","However, among the objects they placed in the path of the new radiation, they included paraffin, which is made up of the light atoms of carbon and hydrogen.",A neutron has a spin of ½ while a proton-electron combination would have a spin of either 0 or 1.,"The nuclear spin of the common isotope, nitrogen-14, was measured accurately over and over again and turned out to be 1.","In a rough way, one could tell the kind of nucleus that struck from the nature of the sparkling.","Protons in Nuclei Let us, nevertheless, go on to describe some of the progress made in the 1920s in terms of the proton-electron theory that was then accepted.","[Illustration: _Ernest O. Lawrence holds a model of the first cyclotron in 1930, a year after its conception._]                               THE NEUTRON Nuclear Spin What Rutherford did not (and could not) take into account were the consequences of a completely new type of nuclear bombardment involving a type of particle unknown in the 1920s (though Rutherford speculated about the possibility of its existence).",By 1927 Aston had made it clear that it is the middle elements in the neighborhood of iron that are most closely and economically packed.,"In the absence of electrons, what kept the protons clinging together?","Powell’s particle was called a “pi-meson”, soon abbreviated to “pion”."
