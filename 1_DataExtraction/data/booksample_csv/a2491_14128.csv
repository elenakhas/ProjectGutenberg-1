"It was already dark, when Elsbeth finally came to herself and could think of her child.","""I think I will go to the pastor, who has already given me advice,"" said his mother, delighted to have found a way out of the difficulty.","So they hurried back to the house, took a little bread and milk and started on their way again.","But then he ran right away in order to get back without being wet, and did not trouble himself further about the boy.","""Yes, yes, I saw it, Toni,"" replied his mother with a sigh, ""but did you hear what the wood-carver said?""","Then the man took the wooden jug, swung the milk-pail on his back and went out.",For five years the family lived in harmony and undisturbed peace.,"The herdsman turned off to the left with the big herd, and the man went with Toni up towards the right, followed by the smaller herd, which consisted of fewer cows but many young cattle, for not many cows could be kept on the small mountain pasture, because the milk had to be carried across to the big one where the herdsman's hut stood.",He received no answer.,Toni was so alarmed he could hardly breathe.,Toni followed him.,The mother ran to her Toni and tried to seize his hand.,It was not long before the work was finished.,"""Oh, my God!""",The last rays of the setting sun fell across the meadows and the sound of the evening bells came up from Kandergrund.,His mother too began to consider.,"The wrestlers would often call to him: ""Come and play!""",He can go up to the small mountain with the cows.,"""Now I will try one thing more,"" he said one morning to his wife.","He quickly tried to draw them, too, with his pencil and at home continued drawing the animals again and again as long as he had a bit of paper.","The farmer harnessed immediately, glad that further responsibility was taken from him and he had only to carry Toni as far as the railway.",repeated the doctor over and over again.,She had had only the one child and could so well understand the mother's trouble.,"But all around both pastures great dark masses of mountains looked down, some rocky, gray and jagged, others covered with snow, all reaching up to the sky, so high and mighty and with such different peaks and horns and some with such broad backs, that it almost seemed to Toni as if they were enormous giants, each one having his own face and looking down at him.",She forgot everything around her.,Thus the years passed by.,Then suddenly the thought came to him that if they were of wood they could stand.,"Now we are going for Father!""","The farmer was very friendly, and thought her goat was now by far one of the finest, because she had had good fodder so long.","""Don't go to the farmer!",Has he no taste for some other occupation?,Then she started down to Interlaken.,"But when Elsbeth asked after her Toni, he broke off abruptly and said he had so much to do, she must go to the Pastor, for he would have the best knowledge about the boy.","Don't you know your mother any more?""","""Can't you speak?","Many days of thunder storms followed, one after another and if the sun came out between, it burned unbearably, and new storms followed so unceasingly and violent, that the herdsman, on the other mountain often said that he had not known such a summer for years, and if it didn't change he wouldn't make half so much butter as in former summers, because the cows gave no milk, as they didn't like the fodder.",So the time passed.,But that really cannot be.,The man came and went.,It was very hard for him to leave his mother and remain away from her so much.,"Near the hut in the little shed was the goat, the milk of which supplied food for the mother and child, while the father received his board through the week on the farms where he worked from morning until night.",Then lively little Marie jumped down from her chair and came to Toni with a large piece of bread and butter.,"Then the pastor sat down, wrote a letter and said to the herdsman's boy: ""Go back to the Matten farm and tell the farmer to harness his little carriage and send it to me, and then I will see that Toni goes to-day to Bern.",Toneli repeated the prayer.,"Soon the doctor appeared, and after he had prepared the mother not to expect Toni to speak at the first moment, he brought him in.",He had no greater wish than to see his mother happy and contented.,There stood a little hut.,"Toni was never so content as when he was sitting in the little stone hut with his carving and his mother came in and out happily employed, always saying a kindly word to him and finally sat down beside him at her spinning-wheel.",The child obeyed.,"The pastor received her very cordially, had her sit down beside him and enquired with interest about her affairs, for he knew Elsbeth and how bravely she had helped herself through all the hard times.",He was not accustomed to the ways of the other boys since he had been constantly alone with his quietly working mother and used to performing definite tasks continually without any noise.,"Don't forget to pray, when the day begins, and when it ends, and the dear Lord will not forget you, and His protection is better than that of men.""","He called up to the boy, but received no answer.","""I must go to him; I must help him and see about bringing him home.""","When his mother finished speaking, the wood-carver said it seemed to him as if she thought the affair would half go of itself, but it was not so.","""Oh, my Lord,"" exclaimed Elsbeth, ""many hundred times I have repeated it beside his little bed, when he was very small, often with many tears, and he would weep too, when he didn't know why.""",Toni and the man stepped inside.,"The necessary expense of board and instruction was beyond anything that she could manage, so much so that it was quite out of the question.",She spoke kindly to him and invited him to come to the table and eat something with her children.,"The mother put on her shawl, tied on her best apron and stepped out of the house.","A king couldn't have anything better.""","When he had been four weeks in the sanitarium all hope disappeared, for the doctor had exhausted every means.","He still clung to her with the same love, helped her in every way as well as he could and spent his life beside her, entirely at his quiet occupation, in which he gradually acquired a quite gratifying skill.","It is wholly inconceivable, quite incomprehensible!""","""I have written to my friend, the Pastor, and asked him if the boy was very much attached to his mother, and if so, to send for her right away.",They had become perfectly quiet.,"If you will only let me be a wood-carver, I will work so hard, that I will earn enough, and you will not have to do so much, and then I can stay at home with you.","The one he had with him was a strong, sturdy fellow of sixteen years.","Toni had long since fled into the hut, but the lightning showed him the frightful forms and it seemed every minute as if the rolling thunder would overthrow the hut to the ground.",Elsbeth stepped up to him.,"Then he came out again, sat down on the ground and carved on a piece of wood he had in his pocket, for although he no longer dared to cherish the hope of becoming a wood-carver, yet he could not help carving for himself as well as he could.","""Then we will go too,"" replied Toneli, starting ""Yes, yes, we shall go there too,"" promised his mother, ""but now we must first go home to the stone hut,"" and without a word she went with the little one back to the silent cottage.",The herd had already been climbing the mountain for several hours.,Toneli remained unmoved.,"He thought of his mother, where she was now and how she was in the habit of standing with him at this time in front of the little cottage and talking so pleasantly.",In the first week of September the last guests left the hotel in Interlaken where Elsbeth had spent the summer.,"""See, you must do so,"" and the little girl bit a good piece from the bread and held it to him, then again a little nearer, so he only needed to bite into it.","On the other rock stood a hunter, his gun hanging by his side, and his hat, with even a feather in it, sat on his head, all so finely carved, that one would think it must be a real hat and a real little feather, and yet all was of wood.","""Now I understand how he was aroused by these words.","Here lived the honest day-laborer Toni, who conducted himself well in every farm-house, where he went to work, for he was quiet and industrious, punctual at his tasks, and reliable in every way.","""That is fortunate,"" continued the farmer.",He drew back and pressed into the corner staring into vacancy.,"The little one was still sitting beside her on the ground, with both hands pressed to his eyes, and sobbing pitifully."
