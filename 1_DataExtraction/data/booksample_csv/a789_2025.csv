""you will see to that, won't you, Imp?""","Coming at last to the shrubbery gate, we paused awhile to regain our breath.",Mr. Selwyn shrugged his shoulders and turned to the Imp.,"""Anything you like, Imp, so long as we find her.""","Never was the song of the water more pleasant to my ear, never was the spring and bend of the long sculls more grateful, as the banks swept by faster and faster.","""Heave to, there!""","It is an inn with raftered ceilings, and narrow, winding passageways; an inn with long, low chambers full of unexpected nooks and corners, with great four-post beds built for tired giants it would seem, and wide, deep chimneys reminiscent of Gargantuan rounds of beef; an inn whose very walls seem to exude comfort, as it were--the solid comfortable comfort of a bygone age.","Down this she fled, and her laughter came to me on the wind.","""Much better--he died in my arms, sir.","she mocked, nodding her head at me.","""Bless ye for that, sonny!""","""What, my noble Benjamin?""","Wondering, I took a step toward her; but as I did so she fled from me, running toward the house, never stopping or slackening speed, until I had lost sight of her altogether.",Out upon thee!,"""Sir,"" I answered, ""I do not.""","""Yes.""","""Blood-in-the-Eye!""","""Y-e-e-s, I suppose so,"" said Dorothy rather dubiously.","""Whereaway, my Imp?""","His name was Trueheart.""","""Oh, yes; you were so angry with Uncle Dick an' me--so frightfull' angry, you know, that I was going to try to find the 'wonderful lamp' so I could wish everything all right again an' all of us 'live happy ever after'; but the blasted oak did just as well, an' was nicer, somehow, wasn't it?""","""Imp, what do you mean?""","he broke off, and lugging something from his pocket, disclosed a tattered, paper-covered volume (the Imp's books are always tattered), and hastily turning the pages, paused at a certain paragraph and read as follows: ""'Henceforth my roof shall be the broad expanse of heaven, an' all tyrants shall learn to tremble at my name!'","""'Is two 'ands!""","""Yes, sir; I saw him.""","""Just a minute, Uncle Dick, while I get my parcels.","The Imp seemed much cast down, and even shocked.","""Must you go?""","""I know I can, sir.","""You wouldn't go loving anybody, would you, Uncle Dick?""","And thus it was we parted, the Imp and I, beneath the ""blasted oak,"" and I know my heart was strangely heavy as I turned away and left him.",Suddenly I started and looked round; surely that was a sob!,I must get rid of him at all hazards.,"she said, staring at me with frightened eyes, and clasping her hands nervously.","""Then if you will excuse me, I think I'll leave you to--ah--to do it; the next dance is beginning, and--ah--"" ""Certainly,"" I said, ""of course--good-night, and much obliged--really!""","Now, possibly deceived by my pacific attitude, or inspired by the bright eyes of the trim maid-servant, he seized me, none too gently, by the collar, to the horrified dismay of the Imp.","""You will find no difficulty.",supplemented the Imp.,Mr. Selwyn glanced back over his shoulder.,"""He's not a bit bald, you know!","""Very right and proper!""","""Did he though, confound him!""","""All right, master,"" he said at last; ""you've got me!""","Yet, as I say, he does occasionally speak of fish and fishing, and amongst other matters, concerning live frogs as bait, after describing the properest method of impaling one upon the hook, he ends with this injunction: Treat it as though you loved it, that it may live the longer!","""Sir,"" said I, ""I am delighted to make your acquaintance; have heard Her Grace of Chelsea speak of you--her friends are mine, I trust?""","""Yes,"" cried Dorothy, ""do let's go, Auntie.""","""Uncle Dick,"" said the Imp, regarding me with a thoughtful eye, ""did you see his arm--I mean before you smote him 'hip and thigh'?""","""Fed him regularly twice a day,"" I went on, ""and nearly famished himself in the doing of it--you remember the dry-bread incident?""","she said, and I fancied she seemed quite pleased.","he said, and offered me the grubby handkerchief.",repeated Dorothy.,and he kissed the sword.,There was a majestic deliberation in its progress that positively maddened me.,Of course I may be a fool to trust you.,"It needed but this and a second glance at the round face to assure me that it pertained to Ben, the gardener's boy.","I said, puffing at my pipe.","""If I can be of any service--""  Mr. Selwyn stopped me with a wave of his hand.","The boat came slowly into view, impelled by one who rowed with exactly that amount of splashing which speaks the true-born Cockney.","""'Fraid I'm awfull' wicked,"" sighed the Imp, shaking his head, ""'cause I told him a great big lie.""","""'Not far from the village of Down, in Kent, there is a house,'"" she began, ""'a very old house, with pointed gables and pannelled chambers, but empty to-night and desolate.'",I exclaimed.,"Indeed, they made a fitting pair, the worn old soldier and the ancient inn, alike both long behind the times, dreaming of the past, rather than the future;
