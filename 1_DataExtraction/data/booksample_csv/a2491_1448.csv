Fraulein Rottenmeier took the seat beside her and made a sign to Heidi to take the one opposite.,"Then she let the child go, and Heidi ran into the next room, and bid Peter come quickly, for it had now grown quite dark.","Heidi climbed up the steep path from Dorfli as quickly as she could; she was obliged, however, to pause now and again to take breath, for the basket she carried was rather heavy, and the way got steeper as she drew nearer the top.","During the first few days that this happened every room and corner was searched in great alarm, to see if anything had been stolen, for the general idea was that a thief had been hiding in the house and had gone off in the night with the stolen goods; but not a thing in the house had been touched, everything was safe in its place.","Clara immediately screamed out that she could not remain another minute alone, her father must come home, and Fraulein Rottenmeier must sleep in her room at night, and Heidi too must not be left by herself, for the ghost might do something to her.",They started talking again.,"""Here's a state of things!""","Heidi ran back quickly and gave Peter her hand, promising to go with him, and then making her way through the goats she once more clasped Snowflake round the neck, saying in a gentle soothing voice, ""Sleep well, Snowflake, and remember that I shall be with you again to-morrow, so you must not bleat so sadly any more.""","So the autumn and winter passed, and again the sun came shining down on the white walls of the opposite houses, and Heidi would think to herself that now the time had come for Peter to go out again with the goats, to where the golden flowers of the cistus were glowing in the sunlight, and all the rocks around turned to fire at sunset.","""No, she always gives it back to Peter, telling him it is too hard, for I have seen her do it myself,"" affirmed Heidi.","Brigitta went with her to the door, and there said in rather a mysterious voice, ""You might have kept on your dress, he would have known you all right; but you must be careful, for Peter tells me that Alm-Uncle is always now in a bad temper and never speaks.""","""Did you see any other?""","Peter now understood the drift of the old man's questions and that he was the boy who behaved like the unruly goats, and he looked somewhat fearfully towards the corner to see if anything happened to be there such as he used himself on such occasions for the punishment of his animals.","""Who is the old goat?""","Peter looked towards the cupboard where the bread and cheese were kept and said crossly, ""I never said that I should forget the X.""","Tinette disappeared, but soon came back and called down again to Dete, ""Come up, she is expecting you.""","He thought his eyes must deceive him, and yet there she was and no mistake about it.","Then Herr Sesemann returned to Clara, and begged her to have no more fear, as he would soon find out all about the ghost and put an end to it.","""Child, what does this mean?""","""Do what, Peter?""","You must milk two bowlfuls for her when she has her dinner, for she is going with you and will remain with you till you return this evening; but take care she does not fall over any of the rocks, do you hear?""","In the large space between the stove and the wall four planks had been put together as if to make a large receptacle for apples; there were no apples, however, inside, but something Heidi had no difficulty in recognising, for it was her very own bed, with its hay mattress and sheets, and sack for a coverlid, just as she had it up at the hut.","""I will begin by explaining to you how you are to conduct yourself at table,"" and she went on to give Heidi minute instructions as to all she was to do.","She would run away repeatedly from whatever she might be doing, to listen to them, for nothing seemed so strange and wonderful to her as the deep mysterious sound in the tops of the trees.","""Grandfather, you will be able to do something, won't you, so that it need not be as Clara says, and so that she is not obliged to go home?""","""No, I would rather not,"" replied Heidi firmly.",And Heidi took the rolls from the basket and piled the whole twelve up on grandmother's lap.,"""What is the matter?""","""Oh, no, grandfather, we can go back, for grandmamma told me so, and so it was in the beautiful tale in my book--but you have not heard that yet; but we shall be home directly now, and then I will read it you, and you will see how beautiful it is.""","She had quite expected a long and private account of some terrible ghostly experience of his during the night, which she would have enjoyed hearing about in the broad daylight.","Am I not right, General?""",exclaimed the grandmother in surprise.,the sun is up!,"This foe was indeed the prospect of the arrival of the Frankfurt visitors, the thought of whom filled him with exasperation.","Peter remarked scornfully, ""I dare say, when no one knows even where such people live.""","""Sesemann,"" replied the doctor, ""consider what you are doing!","He was as well versed also in the ways of the animals, great and small, and had many amusing anecdotes to tell of these dwellers in caves and holes and in the tops of the fir trees.","He went like lightning, and when he reached Dorfli, which stood on the direct road to Mayenfeld, he made up his mind to go on further, for he was sure he could not stop his rapid descent without hurting himself and the sleigh too.","Then came the picture where he was seen far away from his father's house, obliged to look after the swine, and he had grown pale and thin from the husks which were all he had to eat.",The old woman gave a little sigh.,"The grandfather carried the cakes and the shawl and the large sausage, and the doctor took Heidi's hand, so they all three started down the mountain.","""You must put your arm out in the shape of a ring, and Clara must put hers through it and lean her weight upon you, and whatever you do, don't let your arm give way; like that.","But Heidi gave her grandfather no peace till he consented to do what she wanted; she slept a great deal better, she said, on her bed of hay than on her fine pillowed bed in Frankfurt.","""That's right, eat what you can!""","When at last she saw that Heidi was growing calmer, she said, ""Now I want you to tell me something.","""Go along now and get into your bath while I go and get some milk; when we are together at supper I will tell you all about it.""","""When grandmother goes away, I shall want you to stay on with me.""",The grandmother took the child's hand in hers and held it closely.,"And Clara found a strange new pleasure in sitting all alone like this on the mountain side, her only companion a little goat that looked to her for protection.","Then Heidi went on to give him an account of the whole day, and of how delightful it had all been, and particularly described the fire that had burst out everywhere in the evening.","""Yes, sir,"" replied Sebastian, ""I will see to the matter as you wish.""","And then this one gets into trouble, and cries, 'Save me, God, for there is none other to help me,' and God says, 'Why did you go from Me; I could not help you when you ran away.'","""Twopence.""",As long ago as when his son Tobias was a child Alm-Uncle had rented the tumble- down old place.,"The two men could not help laughing, and the doctor answered that he should never have thought it.","At last, after a great deal of persuasion from Fraulein Rottenmeier, Sebastian and John plucked up courage and agreed to sit up one night in the room next to the large council-chamber and to watch and see what would happen.","She was not allowed, however, a very long interval of time for consideration, for suddenly the sound of a frightful crash was heard in the study, followed by frantic cries for Sebastian.",The boy said nothing but pointed his finger at Heidi.,You keep up your courage!,"But now we must have a little talk together, so dry your tears and come and stand in front of me, so that I may see you well--there, now we are happy again.""","The door was doubly locked at night, and for further security the wooden bar was fastened across it; but it was no good--next morning the door again stood open.","All of a sudden, before Heidi expected it, a voice called out, ""Mayenfeld.""","""Don't you want to hear more about it?""","Meanwhile it had been growing dark, and he had hardly come down from the roof and dragged the sleigh out from behind the goat-shed when Heidi appeared outside.","At last she found voice to call loudly, ""Tinette!","It was not a feeding place of theirs, for they did not care to graze on flowers.","A handsome bookcase with glass doors explained why it was called the study, and here evidently the little girl was accustomed to have her lessons.","After a few minutes' silence, Heidi asked, ""What could I take back to her?""",He gave a little laugh.,"""Yes I did; it is quite fresh.","""I assure you, Peter,"" replied Heidi, ""grandfather knows all about them.","Grandmamma being now seated on her sturdy animal, Uncle took the bridle to lead her down the steep mountain path; she begged him not to come far with her, but he insisted on seeing her safely as far as Dorfli, for the way was precipitous and not without danger for the rider, he said.","The doctor found great pleasure in his companion's conversation, and was astonished at his knowledge of the plants that grew on the mountain: he knew the uses of them all, from the aromatic fir trees and the dark pines with their scented needles, to the curly moss that sprang up everywhere about the roots of the trees and the smallest plant and tiniest flower.",The old woman had detected that Heidi was frightened and was anxious to set her mind at ease.,"here is some one,"" exclaimed Herr Sesemann, ""who will help to clear up matters for me.","""But if it is God Himself who has sent the trouble, what can we say to Him then?""","Then Heidi told him of the mountain with the great snow-field, and how it had been on fire, and had turned rosy-red and then all of a sudden had grown quite pale again and all the color had disappeared.","""Why, you don't know anything about it, I see,"" laughed Herr Sesemann.","So he might take his time about returning, which he did, and reached Dorfli just as Heidi had got home from school and was sitting at dinner with her grandfather.",THE WINTER CONTINUES Peter arrived punctually at school the following day.,Heidi then described to him the rocky mountain with the two high peaks so exactly that the grandfather was delighted.,"said Clara hesitatingly, but she followed Heidi's advice and ventured one firm step on the ground and then another; she called out a little as she did it; then she lifted her foot again and went on, ""Oh, that was less painful already,"" she exclaimed joyfully.","Why have you left off praying?"""
