He took Heidi's hand in his and together they walked down the mountain side.,"""No, no,"" said Herr Sesemann in a very decided voice, ""the child shall take home with her whatever she likes, kittens and tortoises, if it pleases her; we need not put ourselves out about that, Fraulein Rottenmeier.""","As Sebastian opened the door for the doctor he said with a bow, ""Will the Herr Doctor be so kind as to give the little miss my greetings?""",it is not so good as I expected!',"""No, no, Fraulein Rottenmeier, you must wait till papa comes; he has written to say that he will soon be home, and then I will tell him everything, and he will say what is to be done with Heidi.""","I never thought I should ever have such a splendid thing as this to put on.""","""Nonsense,"" continued Dete; then altering her tone to one half- coaxing, half-cross, ""Come, come, you do not understand any better than your grandfather; you will have all sorts of good things that you never dreamed of.""","On the fourth morning, as soon as she saw her grandfather, she said, ""I must go up to see grandmother to-day; she ought not to be alone so long.""",He now grasped the pole with his right hand and gave the sleigh a push forward with his two feet.,"A SUMMER EVENING ON THE MOUNTAIN Herr Sesemann, a good deal irritated and excited, went quickly upstairs and along the passage to Fraulein Rottenmeier's room, and there gave such an unusually loud knock at the door that the lady awoke from sleep with a cry of alarm.","And it is almost as astonishing to me that you should have guessed such an unlikely thing.""","Then Heidi's feelings got the better of her, and she poured forth her trouble.","""What's the meaning of this?""","he asked, evidently unwilling to hear her refuse.","""There, now miss can look out and see what is going on below,"" said Sebastian as he brought her a high wooden stool to stand on.","""That's right, go and learn all you can,"" said the grandmother encouragingly.","Peter, recognising the voice, jumped up like a shot.",Heidi read the address carefully; then she ran back to the shed holding out her letter to her grandfather in high glee.,The shawl she laid over the old woman's knees.,"What could make the little miss run off like that?""","She quickly gathered a bunch of sweet-smelling leaves, and then, holding them under Greenfinch's nose, said coaxingly, ""Come, come, Greenfinch, you must not be naughty!","It was Peter, who had made all that noise knocking the snow off his shoes; he was still white all over with it, for he had had to fight his way through deep snowdrifts, and large lumps of snow that had frozen upon him still clung to his clothes.","""I shall be sure not to lose it,"" said Heidi confidently, and she at once put the roll and the letter at the bottom of her basket.",Peter came up at this moment.,"Clara tried to use her own feet a little, but each time drew them quickly back.","There it lay, the thing he had wanted to see.","It was now some days since Heidi had been out with him, and when at last she did come, there she sat the whole time beside the old gentleman, and Peter could not get a word with her.",When he came up in the morning the invalid child was always already in her chair and Heidi fully occupied with her.,"""If there's a bit that can come through it will,"" she said.","What books did you have to learn from?""","""I will go at once and ask God to forgive me, and I will never forget Him again,"" she replied repentantly.","""It is always like that,"" said Peter composedly, continuing to peel his stick; ""but it is not really fire.""","But Heidi was not to be hindered in her kind intentions, and she continued to jump about, saying over and over again in a tone of exultation, ""Now, grandmother can have a roll every day and will grow quite strong again--and, Oh, grandmother,"" she suddenly exclaimed with an increase of jubilation in her voice, ""if you get strong everything will grow light again for you; perhaps it's only because you are weak that it is dark.""","""As if you had eaten something that would not go down.""","Uncle had sent word back each time that the schoolmaster would find him at home if he had anything he wished to say to him, but that he did not intend to send Heidi to school, and Peter had faithfully delivered his message.","here she comes!""","""Fresh water?""","""I have got a bed already, and Clara has put such a lot of clothes in my box that I shall never want any more.""","""Up on the mountain.""","""Yes, they will,"" Clara assured her.","But then she would hear her grandfather's voice outside, attending to the goats, and these would give one or two loud bleats, as if calling to her to make haste and go to them, and then Heidi was happy again, for she knew she was still at home, and she would jump gladly out of bed and run out to the animals as quickly as she could.","So now be off and remember what I say.""","he exclaimed, leaving the further explanation of the matter to Heidi herself.","If everything had gone on there as usual in a general way, there were still all kinds of particular things to tell Heidi about the various people who composed the Sesemann household, and who were all so well known to Heidi.",Heidi soon came running out with her book under her arm.,"""Yes, I know, it's enough to make you out of patience with me; but you must understand, dear friend""--and Herr Sesemann laid his hand imploringly on the doctor's shoulder--""that I feel I have not the courage to refuse the child what I have been promising her all along, and for months now she has been living on the thought of it day and night.","Clara greeted him with a cry of joy, and seeing her so lively and apparently as well as ever, his face cleared, and the frown of anxiety passed gradually away from it as he heard from his daughter's own lips that she had nothing the matter with her, and moreover was so delighted to see him that she was quite glad about the ghost, as it was the cause of bringing him home again.",miau!,"""I'll teach you to ring bells like that!","Even when she heard he had gone off alone, she still had an idea that a messenger would be sent over from Frankfurt to fetch the child.",Heidi walked into the room.,"She was so excited that she could hardly get her words out when she did get up to him, but he soon understood, and a look of extreme pleasure came into his face.",When Heidi was going to get into bed that night she found her old straw hat lying under the counterpane.,Peter had fallen asleep after his fatigue and the goats were climbing about among the bushes overhead.,"Heidi looked round as if in search of something, some new idea had evidently come into her head.","There was no Peter that day, and Heidi stood at the little window looking out in wonderment, for the snow was beginning again, and the thick flakes kept falling till the snow was up to the window, and still they continued to fall, and the snow grew higher, so that at last the window could not be opened, and she and her grandfather were shut up fast within the hut.","Heidi went up to the side of the bed and said, ""Are you very ill, grandmother?""","""That's right, Heidi; you have kept your word,"" said the grandfather, and then wrapping the sack firmly round her he lifted her in his arms and strode off with her up the mountain.","""I shan't go,"" said Peter obstinately.","""No, on my honor, sir; pray, do not think it; I am very uncomfortable about the matter myself,"" answered Sebastian with unmistakable truthfulness.",Suddenly she turned round and reached Clara's side out of breath with running and excitement.,"""No, no, it was beautiful, beautiful!""","""What, you are awake already, are you?""",Heidi turned over the leaves and read a line out softly to herself here and there.,"But they were too heavy for her to put aside, so she crept underneath them to get to the window.",And two large tears rolled down the old man's cheeks.,"Suddenly she jumped up and ran round, for she must know what her grandfather was doing.","it's all gone, Peter.""","Take the child in hand, do with her what you will, and make her whole and sound, and then she shall go home; but you must do something first.""","""Yes, it was not that; everything in Frankfurt is as nice as it could be.""",But Dete was prepared with an exceedingly amiable speech and began at once to praise the looks of the child.,"Clara could not conceive what was in it, and cast longing glances towards it.","She went up to the round window and looked out, and grandfather followed up with Clara in his arms, Heidi springing up after them.",Heidi persisted.,"""But the child is not a goat or a bird, she is a human being.","""That is a good idea,"" said Brigitta; ""but then, they would get hard and stale.",Shake hands!,"After many years of joyless life, the blind grandmother had at last found something to make her happy; her days were no longer passed in weariness and darkness, one like the other without pleasure or change, for now she had always something to which she could look forward.",Just as he did so a sudden gust of air blew through the open front door and put out the light which John held in his hand.,"Meanwhile Dete had arrived and was waiting in the hall, wondering what extraordinary event had come to pass for her to be sent for at such an unusual hour.","Some, however, adopted a new tone and expressed their opinion that Alm- Uncle was not so bad after all as they thought, ""for see how carefully he took the little one by the hand.""","Heidi ran off, and Clara began to hold out the leaves one by one to Snowflake, who snoozled up to her new friend in a confiding manner and slowly ate the leaves from her hand.","asked Heidi, as she clambered down the mountain at Peter's side; she waited eagerly for his answer, hoping that he would tell her it was so."
