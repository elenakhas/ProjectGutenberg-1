no one seemed to have the least hope except Brownie herself, who, however, was absolutely confident.",Peter asked tragically.,But Peter hesitated.,"his heart, the doctor said, remained cold.","He would not eat worms or insects (which they thought very silly of him), so they brought him bread in their beaks.","'I should like to,' she answered, 'but will there be room in your boat for two?'",He popped off the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments.,She did a very kind thing; she took off her scarf and gave it to him.,"When a real bird falls in flop, he spreads out his feathers and pecks them dry, but Peter could not remember what was the thing to do, and he decided rather sulkily to go to sleep on the weeping-beech in the Baby Walk.",I shall tell you presently how he got his paddle.,"She said there was only time now to walk to the top of the Hump and back, and as they trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little breasts.","Another good plan, which David and I sometimes follow, is to stare them down.","But Maimie's curiosity tugged her forward, and presently at the seven Spanish chestnuts she saw a wonderful light.","Between the well and the Round Pond are the cricket pitches, and frequently the choosing of sides exhausts so much time that there is scarcely any cricket.",'It is coming nearer!',"He remained sitting on the floor and held his breath, wondering how she knew that he had come back.","He cannot with dignity retreat, but he stops and looks about him as if lost in admiration of the scenery, and presently he strolls away with a fine indifference and a glint at me from the corner of his eye.","Perhaps the drawer had creaked;

it simply means that she is doing as she has seen the fairies do; she begins by following their ways, and it takes about two years to get her into the human ways.",After this it was most orderly.,He quite argued with her as if she could hear him.,His oddities tickled them every day] Peter wore no nightgown now.,"It was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his own home he skimmed away over St. Paul's to the Crystal Palace and back by the river and Regent's Park, and by the time he reached his mother's window he had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird.","They were sitting by this time on a fallen tree;

it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking, yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now.","So he stretched out his hand to pull it to him, but this time it ran at him, and he was so alarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat.","Then he would make her presents of his favourite toys (which he always took away from her next morning), and she accepted them with a disturbing smile.","'Of course they might want your clothes,' he had to admit rather falteringly.",The bow-legged children in the Gardens are those who had to walk too soon because their father needed the perambulator.,"[Illustration: When you meet grown-up people in the Gardens who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are] Peter was a just master, and paid his work-people every evening.","But she looked sad, and he knew why she looked sad.","All children could have such recollections if they would press their hands hard to their temples, for, having been birds before they were human, they are naturally a little wild during the first few weeks, and very itchy at the shoulders, where their wings used to be.","You yachtsmen with your wands, who think we are all there to gaze on you, your ships are only accidents of this place, and were they all to be boarded and sunk by the ducks, the real business of the Round Pond would be carried on as usual.","He had to fly back, sobbing, to the Gardens, and he never saw his dear again.","Naturally Queen Mab felt disgraced, and first she tried the effect of ordering the court into tears for nine minutes, and then she blamed the Cupids and decreed that they should wear fools' caps until they thawed the Duke's frozen heart.",'How could you get across?',"You see, though still a tiny child, it was really years and years since he had seen his mother, and I dare say the baby who had supplanted him was now a man with whiskers.",and 'But will it wear?',"There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk, where Maimie arrived in time to see a magnolia and a Persian lilac step over the railing and set off for a smart walk.","Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy again, but on the other hand, what times those had been in the Gardens!","they asked, quite surprised, and, really, Peter could not explain how he knew.","But she spoke no more, she made little moans only, and when he next peeped at her she was once more asleep, with tears on her face."
