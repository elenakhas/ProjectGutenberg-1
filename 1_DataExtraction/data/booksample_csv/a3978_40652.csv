Q.","Because the air will always hold in solution a certain quantity of vapour, (which varies according to its temperature): and when the air is _not saturated with vapour_, it may be condensed without parting with it.","Because the wind (striking against the steeple) _is reflected back_; and tumbles down the vestry chimney, forcing the smoke _into the room_.",The order may be thus arranged:--1.,Q.,"A starved man shrinks _just as a fire does_, unless it be supplied with sufficient fuel.",Q.,"Because the polished metal and woollen cloth _part with their heat so slowly_, that the vapour of the air is _not chilled into dew_ as it passes over them.",Why so?_ A.,1.--CONDUCTION.,The air itself is composed of two gases (_nitrogen and oxygen_) mixed together.,"_Why does a KETTLE RUN OVER, when the water BOILS?_ A.","The parchment head of the drum _vibrates_ from the blow of the drum-stick, and sets in motion the sound-waves of the air.","In a _fine_ day, the clouds are often 4 or 5 miles above our head; but the average height of the clouds is from 1-1/2 to 2 miles.",Q.,Q.,"In _frosty_ weather, the rise of the barometer presages _snow_.",Q.,_What is the 8TH SPECIAL RULE in regard to the barometer?_ A.,Because the sun-light _increases their carbon_; which (mingling with the yellow sap) turns the potato _green_.,_Why can we HEAR distant clocks MOST distinctly in CLEAR COLD weather?_ A.,Q.,_Why is a PRIMROSE YELLOW?_ A.,_Why is a YELLOW SUNSET an indication of WET?_ A.,Q.,"A starved man shrinks _just as a fire does_, unless it be supplied with sufficient fuel.",Q.,Q.,"_Why is not the END of a long wick BURNT OFF, as it hangs over the flames?_ A.",_Why does the fire catch the FACE more than the REST of the body?_ A.,"Because the volatile parts, (which rise from dunghills, sewers, &c.), being _laden with vapour_, are unable to rise so readily, as when they are rarefied by a bright sun.",2.--LIQUEFACTION.,(N.
