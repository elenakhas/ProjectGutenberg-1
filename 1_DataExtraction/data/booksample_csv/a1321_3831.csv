"Rivardi, letting himself go on the flood-tide of hope and ambition, pleased his mind with imaginary pictures of Morgana as his wife and as mother of his children, rehabilitating his fallen fortunes, restoring his once great house and building a fresh inheritance for its former renown.","All will be well for you!""","he said--""Few are really 'fitting' for marriage nowadays.","""I'm afraid I don't think!""","Morgana always being the kindest of patrons to Lady Kingswood, and discoursing feminine commonplaces with her as though there were no other subjects of conversation in the world than embroidery and specific cures for rheumatism.","""I am sorry to hear you say that!""",The first move towards war--the first gun fired--means annihilation for one of you or both!,"Oh, yes!","answered the Voice--""Convince yourself!--do not be deceived!","""How beautiful they are!""","Such a moon it was, too!","""No,--not I, my child!","she said--""Take a look at my car and see how you'd like to travel in it!""","Each one looked at the other enquiringly, but with no responsive result.","came the reply, spoken softly and with tenderness--""We shall meet again soon!","and as he spoke Rivardi gripped his steering-gear with a kind of vindictive force--""It seems absurd that we,--two men of fair intelligence and scientific attainment,--should be ruled by her whim,--her fancies--for after all she is made up of fancies--"" Gaspard shook his finger warningly.","said Morgana, and now she withdrew her hand from his grasp--""So you went up alone?""","It gets over me.""","Now we have finished our rescue work we may go--we can start at once--"" He looked at her.","The Marchese Rivardi, thinking along the usual line of masculine logic, had frequently turned over the problem of Morgana's complex character such as it appeared to him,--and had almost come to the conclusion that if he only had patience he would succeed in persuading her that wifehood and motherhood were more conducive to a woman's happiness than all the most amazing triumphs of scientific discovery and attainment.","Her physical fascination was magnetic, and for a moment he had some trouble to resist its spell.","How could it fly without an engine?--they very sensibly demanded,--for engine there was none!","But if we knew their lives and intentions, I dare say we should find they are quite as clever in their own line as we are in ours!'","""Yes!","What are the dwellers in your city, if it is in truth a city, and not a dream!""","As he vanished there was a sudden cry--a rush as of wings--and a woman sprang up from amid bushes where she had lain hidden,--it was Manella.","""To think of such a thing!",Very soon!,"There's a tradition in the part of Scotland where I was born which tells of a history far far back in time when sailors from Phoenicia came to our shores,--men greatly civilised when we all were but savages, and they made love to the Highland women and had children by them,--then when they went away back to Egypt they left many traces of Eastern customs and habits which remain to this day.","cried Morgana, with sudden energy--""That was anything but happiness!","""I hope you will do nothing rash!""",The Voice hesitated.,"This was an unexpected question, the result of a subconscious suggestion in Manella's mind which she herself could not have explained.",No man is too strong for God!,"Have you altered the course?""","And therefore she did not know that ""fey"" women are a race apart from all other women in the world.",she said.,"This she quickly packed and locked, ready for her journey.","Morgana looked up at him with a little smile, but her eyes were tearful.","She recalled the magnificent ball given by Morgana Royal at her regal home, when all the fashion and frivolity of the noted ""Four Hundred"" were assembled, and when the one whispered topic of conversation among gossips was the possibility of the marriage of one of the richest women in the world to a shabbily clothed scientist without a penny, save what he earned with considerable difficulty.",You were both quite worn out!,They are no part of the divine scheme of things.,she queried.,"In a kind of stupor he watched her go, her light figure disappearing by degrees, as she went up the ascending path from the sea to the house where gay music was still sounding for dancers not yet grown weary.","Messages on a Sound-Ray can reach YOU, as well as me!""",You are still in the dumps about my steering the 'White Eagle!',But does it matter at all what men think or care for?,"""It must be a terrible responsibility for her to have so much money!""","""Ah, just that!""","""Would YOU?""",Lady Kingswood's lips trembled;
