It was one morning, ""beside Mrs. Charles Norton's tea-room, in Queen's Gate Terrace,"" that his ""thrilling opportunity"" came to sit opposite to Mr. Frederic Harrison, eminent in the eyes of the young American, not for his own sake so much as because recently he had been the subject of Matthew Arnold's banter.",We may define his genius more exactly by saying that his is a general practice.,The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.,"If his vision had been aesthetic and sensual, he might have been D'Annunzio.",2.,"In the Wycherley correspondence, Pope omits Wycherley's remonstrance to him and publishes his own remonstrance to Caryll as a letter from himself to Wycherley.","He is great among the second, not among the first poets.","At the same time, it is not easy, on literary grounds, to acquiesce in all the praises that have been heaped upon him.","He is so remote that some people regard his work with mixed feelings, as a rather uncanny thing.",It is the tragic realists for whom the common man is a theme so perilous in its temptations to dullness.,"She was like a      living creature thrown to the rage of a mob: hustled terribly,      struck at, borne up, flung down, leaped upon.","""Ah!","Most people who knew him contend that he talked even better than he wrote; but one gets a good enough example of his ruling mood and attitude in the fine essay called _On Saying Good-bye._ Meditating on life as ""a sustained good-bye,"" he writes:      Life is a cheap _table d'h√¥te_ in a rather dirty restaurant, with      Time changing the plates before you have had enough of anything.","He saw the daffodils dancing by the lake, the green linnet dancing among the hazel leaves, and the young lambs bounding, as he says in an unexpected line, ""as to the tabor's sound,"" and his heart danced to the same music, like the heart of a mystic caught up in holy rapture.",His sense of beauty is frail and midge-like compared with his sense of everlasting frustration.,THE NOVELIST OF GRAINS AND SCRUPLES Henry James is an example of a writer who enjoyed immense fame but little popularity.,He achieves wit through malice: he achieves only rhetoric through virtue.,"To meet him in his books is one of the desirable experiences of contemporary literature, as to hear him speak is one of the desirable experiences of modern politics.","Watts-Dunton, finding the poor creature moulted and ""off its feed,"" carried it down to Putney, resolved to domesticate it.",In _Riders to the Sea_ he wrote as one who had been touched by the simple tragedy of human life.,"He has gone about, like a pickpocket of illusions, from the world of literature to the world of morals, and from the world of morals to the world of politics, and, everywhere he has gone, an innumerable growl has followed him.",It is this that enables him to turn his inferno into a purgatory.,"It seems likely enough, however, that in choosing it the author had in mind the fact that the supreme word of charitableness in the history of man was spoken concerning a woman who was taken in adultery.",Wordsworth had ceased to believe in liberty.,Mr. Yeats is by nature a poet of the heroic world--a hater of the burgess and of the till.,"And again he heard that voice, forced and ringing feebly, but with      a penetrating effect of quietness in the enormous discord of      noises, as if sent out from some remote spot of peace beyond the      black wastes of the gale; again he heard a man's voice--the frail      and indomitable sound that can be made to carry an infinity of      thought, resolution, and purpose, that shall be pronouncing      confident words on the last day, when the heavens fall and justice      is done--again he heard it, and it was crying to him, as if from      very, very far: ""All right.""","The Barbarian is as proud as a savage in a top hat when he      talks of the elliptical or the hyperbolic universe, and tries to      picture parallel straight lines converging or diverging--but never      doing anything so vulgarly old-fashioned as to remain parallel.","What makes it all the more difficult to decide in the present instance is one's feeling that _The Sense of the Past_, had it been completed, would have been very nearly a masterpiece.","Whether the Bishop deliberately hushed up the fact that, during his early travels in France, Wordsworth fell in love with an aristocratic French lady who bore him an illegitimate child, I do not know.",It is easy to see in the last lines that Mr. Squire has escaped finally from the idealist's disgust to the idealist's exaltation.,"The existence of a nobility, he held, ""has a necessary, tendency to dishonour labour.""","His sonnets, it may be argued, are more than decorations.","It was not a slavery without dignity, however.",There never was a landscape so alive with horror as that amid which the knight travelled in quest of the Dark Tower.,"Her father, like the clergy in her novels, was a man of leisure--of so much leisure, as Mr. Cornish reminds us, that he was able to read out Cowper to his family in the mornings.","Some readers are bewildered by his respectability in trivial things, such as dress, into failing to see his hatred of respectability when accepted as a standard in spiritual things.","Mr. Chesterton, however, believes in giving way to one's prejudices.",But it is an essential part of the scheme of the poem.,"Mr. Masefield has generously provided six pages of glossary at the end of his poem, where we are told the meaning of ""futtock-shrouds,"" ""poop-break,"" ""scuttlebutt,"" ""mud-hooks,"" and other items in the jargon of the sea.","It may seem an obvious thing to say about almost any poet, but Browning differed from other poets in being able to express, not only the love of his own heart, but the love of the hearts of all sorts of people.","Man in Mr. Conrad's stories is always a defier of the devils, and the devils are usually put to flight.","""I could not wound her by disobeying.",Not that his portraiture is always faithful.,"When the soldiers come looking for Antony, so helpless with terror is the miller, that he flies into hiding among his sacks, and his brother has to impersonate him in the interview with the officer who carries out the search.",They are full of the hoof-beats of Pegasus.,"One may disagree with this--for in natural magic Keats does not rank even with Shelley--and, at the same time, feel that Matthew Arnold gives Keats too little rather than too much appreciation.","Keats's work, indeed, is in large measure simply the beautiful expression of bodily desire, or of something of the same nature as bodily desire.","The truth is Mr. Yeats is too original and, as it were, secret a poet to capture all at once the imagination that has already fixed the outlines of its kingdom amid the masterpieces of literature.","Come life, come death, not a word be said;
