If there are dens this is a good place to construct them.,"It seemed from the amount of tracks that they had fought a duel and the crow had come out ahead, for he was still alive.","In fact, it was not generally known that any number of mink existed here.",Various forms of traps have been experimented with to obviate this difficulty.,"Also have some musk or some reliable scent, and put a few drops on a stick a short distance from the trap.",A mink will sometimes make a trail in the fresh snow by passing several times over the same route and then never use that trail again.,"Now set your trap, turn the spring to one side, fasten the chain the handiest way you can so it is secure.",Mr. Mink is not at home.,"Not like the muskrat, the habits of the mink are almost the same in all localities, but changing some in different seasons of the year.","After finding a suitable hole for setting your trap, throw a piece of muskrat liberally doped with equal parts of oil of peppermint and sweet oil back in the hole, and set your trap at the entrance; use a little care in concealing the trap and sprinkle a few drops of the above oil over the trap, and you may be sure of having the pleasure of skinning the first mink that comes along.",Being a green hand at the business I did not know whether it would work or not.,"The first snows afford good conditions for the rudimentary training, as the trail can then be plainly seen by the trapper (or rather hunter as he should be styled in this case) while a good scent is left for the dog.","Now puncture with needle to let fumes of salt through; cut a hole through the ice at the edge of the water, scrape out hole to bed salt in; but first put a stone in the hole, and bottom and side it up with stone to keep the mud from clogging the needle holes.","The most successful trapper uses some deadfalls as well as steel traps, especially if trapping for a season at one place.",It is very convenient in form and is strong and reliable.,"Many trappers advocate the use of both bait and sliding pole or spring pole, but personally I do not care for either, unless there is danger of trap lifters ""swiping"" your game; in such cases the sliding pole is the best, as it is more humane and game is entirely concealed.","Noting the cross-section of the jaws, as illustrated at the left, it is plain the animal can only gnaw off its leg at a point quite a distance below the meeting edges.",I then pulled on the other chain and the mink was in the trap.,"You may think this a small thing, but it is just such trifles that circumvent the shy fellows.","Some places are good for one or more mink every year; an old hollow log near the water, a passageway among roots or under a fallen tree trunk, a narrow shelf along the face of the bluff, a particular hole or den--any of these, if kept guarded by a well set trap, may prove a little bonanza for you every season.",0 held him by two toes.,"I used to use bait altogether, but very few mink can now be caught around here with bait.",If experience is worth anything I am sure of it.,"The mink smells the bait from below and springing up to investigate often lands plump in the trap, when if he had been afforded the chance for a closer inspection he might have gone on without troubling it.","Drive a few stakes on each side of a log at the ends to prevent the animal from jumping shore to one side of trap, and use extra strong traps, as you are likely to drop on a fox or coon with this set.","I have two methods for trapping them; one is to find a hole along some stream, an old muskrat or woodchuck hole is best.","As it was spring, they were all finished and the rats were no longer working on them.","At the hole use a small trap, Blake & Lamb is the easiest and quickest set.",Try this method once and be convinced.,"Locate your traps on long, comparatively straight reaches of the stream, as mink often make short cuts when traveling and might miss your set entirely if placed on a bend.",It was in January and we were camped on the Elk River.,I never fail to get them when I find signs of them.,"I would rather have trapped alone, but as I was just starting in I thought I would rather have some one with me that knew a little more about it.",All at once it turned square to the left going some thirty feet and came to an old dried up mole covered with the snow.,"Mink is about all there is to trap in this part of North Carolina, and I have studied out a good many things about trapping them.","Another is to get a dependable trap, which in my estimation is a Newhouse No.","She said, why don't you put salt around your traps?","The tail has, of course, to be skinned while fresh, and I cut off a ring or two of either the windpipe or tail and run a sharp stick through each piece, and carry them in my bait bag with the sticks in.",Brush away your tracks and do not approach too close.,"Mink often follow muskrat trails, especially in the fall before the snow comes.","Oftentimes while walking through the winter wood I find the track of a mink, that starts or ends in a brook or pond, says a New England trapper.",In dry land sets they walk right into your trap and you can get rid of them.,It is too tedious to get the mink over the trap to have something go wrong at the critical moment.,These two sets you can use all winter.,"Now that will do in West Virginia, but in Pennsylvania in this part of the state it takes a water set or a deadfall to catch the mink.","In setting for mink on land I go about it in this way: First, I prepare my traps by boiling in hemlock boughs.",Still another is where the muskrats got an opening through the ice or frozen bank.,CHAPTER XI.,I remember well my first experience at this style of trapping mink.,[Illustration: TRAPPING DOWN STREAM.],"Well now the stream is all frozen over tight so that nothing can get into the brook from the outside, so I don't see why a mink coming, up that brook under the ice--for under the ice they must come or we would see their tracks somewhere along the bank--can smell the bait on the outside, so what I think best is this: Take an axe and cut a long hole about 8 inches wide clear across the brook.","Now the reason for this is that the mink will very often just take a peep in and then go on, in which case if the trap was set inside you would fail to get him.","I had some of my traps in water and some on sand bars concealed the best I knew how, but I did not get him that way.",We caught several this way.,"I discarded all scents, however, 30 years ago, finding nothing better than fresh bait, the more bloody the better.","This you can make yourself by cutting up a couple of cats and muskrats in fine pieces and let them rot good, then add some fish oil and four or five different kinds of oil that you can buy at a drug store.","""That's good,"" I said, ""tell me about it.""","The third one I never vary from, and that is to set every trap as carefully as possible, as though it was intended to catch a shy mink or coon, as one of those animals will often happen around when one least expects it.",But jam an old rusty trap in his den and not cover it or set a rusty trap under old rotten bait.,"Well, I had about given up all hopes of catching him at that place so I decided to move my set 200 yards up stream, where there was a log projecting out over the water 2 feet above the water, where he traveled under.","I hang a piece of muskrat meat with mink scent on it upon a small stick leaning out over my trap, which is set in two or three inches of water, and staked out so as to drown the mink.","To set a trap in the trail would mean to catch a rat, and make a meal for a mink; so I post a rooster's head about two feet from the trail and set a No.",CHAPTER VI.,I set my trap in the spring where he had been wading; the first night he threw the trap and that seemed to make him shy of the spring.,"I never did believe in mixing a lot of stuff together as some say, says a Canadian trapper.","Set trap in water, cause anything that may come along to pass over trap by a row of dead sticks, weeds or a bunch of old weeds.",Do not use bait but can use scent.,"The fox is an exception, as it is rather hard to catch them in deadfalls.",This taught Mr. Mink a lesson.,The fourth winter a few weeks after catching one in the deadfall the trap was down and the bait gone.,The bait hole: This is a good method to use along creeks and rivers before the water freezes over in the fall.,"If a mink starts to go up a brook he's going up before he gets through with it, or lose his life trying; and down the same.","The way just spoken of, of sticking sticks across the water, is a very important way to catch mink, and I advise all trappers to give it a little more thought.",I pulled and all at once his foot slipped out.,"In the sandhill region of Virginia I could catch mink only with the water set, while in the mountains they were very easily caught with the land set.",My opinion is that it is the disturbed surroundings that cause them to shy from the trap.,"""Oh-h-h no!""","Now see that pan is set just about right, not too easy, and now you are ready for the most important part--to cover--so it will stay covered and spring regardless of freezing, thawing, snowing, or blowing, and not to clog the jaws with rubbish.","By selecting a spot where you can keep well hidden, yet commanding a long stretch of beach under some overhanging bank, you stand a good chance to secure a shot if you have plenty of patience.","So if one sees you and turns back startled don't follow him, but just crouch down in a convenient hiding place and wait for him.",Now the way I catch mink mostly is in ditches and springs and runs at the head of marshes and around rivers and trout brooks.,"Partridge heads, wood mice and frogs are all good.","I then set my trap again, tying fast another piece of rabbit, but Mr. Mink had enough rabbit for a while, so about five days afterwards I had a squirrel in it."
