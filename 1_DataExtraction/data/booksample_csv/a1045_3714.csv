save his soul!',"Presently the wagoner suddenly shouted with loud voice,-- ""Up, my grays, up with your feet, keep together!","""Well, then,"" said Bertalda, ""if it must be so, my father said, 'I will not take you with me until you are changed.","At last she slid from the supporting arm of her protector, and sinking down on the moss, she exclaimed: ""Let me lie here, my noble lord; I suffer the punishment due to my folly, and I must now perish here through weariness and dread.""","And Bertalda also could not deny the fact that she felt drawn to Undine with a tender feeling of confidence, however much she might consider that she had cause for the bitterest lamentation at this successful rival.","If you wear a hideous face behind that veil, do not raise it, but take my life, and let me see you not.""","You see, my relatives would then acquire a right over me.","As quick as lightning, the knight sprang to the other side of the horse, and aimed his sharp sword at Kuhleborn's head.","No bridegroom looks thus, and a voice tells me that if you do not leave him, you will never be happy.""",how differently had she once wandered through them!,"Undine, however, would not hear of this; she declared she would rather go with the beautiful stranger, into the wild forest itself, than return to the cottage, where no one did as she wished, and from which the beautiful knight would himself depart sooner or later.","In the name of all the witches, remain among them with your presents, and leave us mortals in peace, you sorceress!""",But the knight sprang between them.,"The knight and the fisherman then refreshed their reverend guest with food and wine, and when he had somewhat recovered himself, he began to relate how he had the day before set out from his cloister, which lay far beyond the great lake, intending to travel to the bishop, in order to acquaint him with the distress into which the monastery and its tributary villages had fallen on account of the extraordinary floods.","Whenever a door opened, the eyes of all were involuntarily turned in that direction, and if it was nothing but the butler with new dishes, or the cup-bearer with a flask of still richer wine, they would look down again sadly, and the flashes of wit and merriment which had passed to and fro, would be extinguished by sad remembrances.","In the height of its glory, summer puts on the flaming and thundering crown of mighty storms, and assumes the air of a king over the earth.","So saying, he thrust his distorted face into the wagon with a grin, but the wagon was a wagon no longer, the horses were not horses--all was transformed to foam and vanished in the hissing waves, and even the wagoner himself, rising as a gigantic billow, drew down the vainly struggling horse beneath the waters, and then swelling higher and higher, swept over the heads of the floating pair, like some liquid tower, threatening to bury them irrecoverably.","I was anxious to work my way in that direction; but a face perfectly white and indistinct, with features ever changing, kept peering at me between the leaves; I tried to avoid it, but wherever I went it appeared also.",Peace and joy had visibly taken up their abode at castle Ringstetten.,"Just then a page appeared, who assured him that he had met the lady on the path to the Black Valley.",CHAPTER III.,"At last he went straight in the direction of a rocky precipice; then it suddenly seemed to me as if a tall white man threw himself across the path of my wild steed; the horse trembled with fear and stopped: I recovered my hold of him, and for the first time perceived that my deliverer was no white man, but a brook of silvery brightness, rushing down from a hill by my side and crossing and impeding my horse's course.""","At length he came close to the brink of the swollen stream, and saw in the moonlight how it had taken its wild course directly in front of the haunted forest, so as to change the peninsula into an island.",But it had yet another meaning.,"""Alas!""","Each wanted to point out to the other the cause of his alarm, but each found the same expression of horror depicted on the face of his neighbor, only that his hands and eyes were directed to a different point where the monster, half-laughing and half-threatening, rose before him.","She invited Bertalda and sent an invitation to her foster-parents, to dine with them on the appointed day, and soon after they parted.","he heard a tearful voice say from without, and then he saw in the mirror his door opening slowly--slowly--and the white figure entered, carefully closing it behind her.","I received this information from the very person who allured Bertalda into the water, away from her parents, and who afterward placed her on the green meadow in the duke's path.""",Bertalda had meanwhile given herself up to a variety of strange thoughts.,"He stepped, however, lovingly in her path, and bold and proud as her resolve had before been, she now felt only too keenly the delight, that the friend whom she so passionately loved should rescue her from this frightful solitude, and that the joyous life in the castle should be again open to her.","You within the cottage, if you fear God and will help me, open to me.""","The fisherman and the knight had been accustomed at their mid-day meal, and also in the evening when the wind roared without, as it was always wont to do toward night, to enjoy together a flask of wine.","cried Bertalda, ""a witch, who has intercourse with evil spirits.",What it is now called we do not know.,"He is, however, powerful, and is esteemed and beloved by many great streams; and as he brought me hither to the fisherman, a light-hearted, laughing child, he will take me back again to my parents, a loving, suffering, and soul-endowed woman.""","Farewell to you and your beautiful wife.""","""He then showed the piece of gold I had given him to the goblins below, and they laughed themselves half-dead over it and hissed at me.","whispered Undine, in a low, half-singing tone, as she nestled closer to Huldbrand's side.","He sees, too, sometimes, that you are dissatisfied with me; that I, in my childishness, am weeping at this, and that Bertalda perhaps is at the very same moment laughing.","""But suppose he should leave his castle,"" said Kuhleborn, ""or should have the fountain opened again!","""And to pass from one thing to another, who may you be yourself?""","""See, oh, pray see,"" exclaimed Bertalda, in an angry, yet uneasy tone, ""how the poor beautiful water is curling and writhing at being shut out from the bright sunshine and from the cheerful sight of the human face, for whose mirror it was created!""","With the earliest beams of morning a pretty carriage drove up to the entrance gate for Undine: the horses which Huldbrand and his squires were to ride stood near, pawing the ground with impatient eagerness.",It seemed as if he were swelling in his fury to the size of a whale.,cried the two men in alarm.,"""Thanks, dear Brook,"" exclaimed Undine, clapping her little hands.","They therefore remained in their quarters, inactively hoping, as men are wont to do, and keeping alive the remembrance of their lost lord by their lamentations.","I must say ""Alas, that our sorrow should be of such short duration?""","We will discuss there how we shall share all things as sisters.""",But Huldbrand was indignant at such unsightly jugglery.,"""The flood is ever rising higher, and what does it matter to me to know who you are?""","It seemed too as if fortune were on his side, for he had not reached his fastened horse, when he distinctly heard Bertalda's plaintive voice not far distant, and could catch her weeping accents through the ever-increasing tumult of the thunder and tempest.","The storm, as if awakened by the tumult, burst forth from the mighty clouds which passed rapidly across the moon; the lake roared under the furious lashing of the wind; the trees of the little peninsula groaned from root to topmost bough, and bent, as if reeling, over the surging waters.","""She is false and boastful,"" interrupted Bertalda, ""and she cannot prove that I am the child of these low people.","After a journey of some days, they arrived one exquisite evening, at castle Ringstetten.","Can it be?""","returned the other, laughing, ""it is just the reverse, the stream goes into the very middle of our road.","for he thinks little enough of these things.""","Upon this the fisher-girl began to weep bitterly, and the young couple perceived for the first time that it was Bertalda.",The matter shall be decided there.,"""I am no spectre,"" said Undine, smiling; ""do I then look so ugly?","Bertalda screamed out that the knight was to be called, but none of her maids ventured from the spot; and even the bride herself became mute, as if trembling at her own voice.","""You cannot leave me,"" she whispered, with confident security, stroking the knight's cheek with her tender hand.",Venture to come to us alone through the haunted forest; that shall be the proof whether you have any regard for us.,"whence, sweet stranger, art thou here?","You see, we were exchanged for each other as children; our faces even then sprang as it were from the same stem, and we will now so strengthen this kindred destiny that no human power shall be able to separate it.","""I have now become,"" he wrote, ""a poor old widower, for my dear and faithful wife is dead.","""The music of the swan!","Human beings, it is true, can raise the stone again with ordinary effort, in spite of the characters inscribed on it.","I love the forest only for this reason, that its beauty is quite peculiar to itself, and it amuses me to pass along in my flowing white garments among the eases and dusky shadows, while now and then a sweet sunbeam shines down unexpectedly upon me.""",The knight pressed her tender hand and stroked her hair.,"""God forbid,"" said the old dame with a start; the fisherman shook his head in silence, and Huldbrand sprang to the window.","""They have opened the spring,"" said she softly, ""and now I am here, and you must die.""","As Undine now insisted upon hearing the knight's promised story, the aged couple smilingly and readily acceded to her desire.","They therefore all opposed the warnings of the priest with a wild and gloomy rashness, until at length the holy father quitted the castle with a sad heart, refusing to accept even for a single night the shelter offered, or to enjoy the refreshments brought him.","Undine wept silently but bitterly, and the old people gave loud expression to their grief.","This idea of the old fisherman's, and the solitude which threatened to overwhelm the knight in all the halls and galleries of the desolate castle, after Bertalda's departure, brought out the feelings that had slumbered till now and which had been wholly forgotten in his sorrow for Undine; namely, Huldbrand's affection for the beautiful Bertalda.","Just then the soft voice of Undine sounded through the uproar, the moon emerged from the clouds, and by its light Undine was seen on the heights above the valley.","""Bertalda!""","If I were to tell you""-- The knight interrupted the fisherman to draw his attention to a noise, as of a rushing flood of waters, which had caught his ear during the old man's talk, and which now burst against the cottage-window with redoubled fury.","Huldbrand now felt certain on the point, but Bertalda asked: ""And what did the master of the fountain want with you, dear Undine?""","So saying, he went out, and the fisherman and his wife followed him, crossing themselves."
