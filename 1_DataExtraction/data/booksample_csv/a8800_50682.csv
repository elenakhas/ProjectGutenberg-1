"""Frigs on.""","They returned to the control room, and Jak, whistling unmelodiously between his teeth, operated the controls that opened the outer door, then used the lifting servo-mechanism to set the signal-sender outside on the icy ground.","A bit later the thought intruded, ""Hey, if that stuff's so powerful now, after all the untold time it was stored there, what was it like when it was new?""","Did not know, or care, that their ship was now speeding around and away from the sun.","And even before that, there'd been reports of strange airships and things.",At the far stem were the driving mechanisms.,"""You and your fishing!","They went into the storeroom, and soon came back, each staggering under the weight and inconvenience of two packs.","As Jon came up, he uttered an exclamation of surprise.","Hardly had it begun opening, however, than they heard the sound of another gun being fired through the opening.",Their mother's voice held a frightened note as she saw in her plate those swiftly approaching flames.,"""No, Father.","""Don't ... know ... yet,"" the elder panted as he worked even more feverishly with his shovel.","He sometimes felt moments of guilt that he made her chase around so much, instead of letting her stay in one place--and remaining with her there.",Now we'll go take a look at your trees.,"""I'll go out,"" Jak offered quickly.","Their mother was a great help in taking the numerous photographs needed, having become quite competent in handling the cameras.","But after a moment he yelped excitedly, ""Hey, they're deflating.","""He sure is!""","""Ready when you are.""","""What do we do about this?""","So now all four felt that eagerness to be done with this matter of last-minute re-checkings, so they could be on their way back to Terra.","*       *       *       *       * ""Looks like a funny place for ore,"" Jon said as the two boys left the ship and started at a fast pace in the direction ""Annie"" had pointed out as the center of activity.","We can refine it as we go.""","""Colonial says it must be fairly close to good water, good soil, forests, and mineral deposits, however.""","""That's probably it.","These consisted of the large, comfortable living room, and two small but compact bunkrooms, the bath-toilet, the kitchen and many ingeniously designed closet and drawer spaces for stowing personal belongings, clothing and supplies.",He turned on the receiver and pointed the directional antenna.,But they disregarded fatigue in the face of their mother's probable danger--or their father's.,"""Don't know exactly how they work, but I can use one.","It took only a few moments to sever the top end, then Jak slid down the trunk and traced the vine to its root, cutting it there.","""Got your pedometer?""","Again he watched one of the smaller ones intently, noticing how it grew.","""'Carveria,' of course, stupid.",Jon picked up his shovel.,"It has been named 'Carveria,' and the five planets and seven satellites are being charted and named.","""Why not?","Soon, in his plate, he saw the top of that cache cover in the nearing distance.","""What about his being so ... so ...","""His drifting out of his coma from time to time shows there is no real damage to his brain, and now he's evidently beginning to come out of the concussion.""",But I know geologists--and possibly chemists--will be intensely interested in studying them.,"So, as soon as they were completely done on Four, he lost no time setting course for Five.",He turned his head again to face the boy with him.,"""Meanwhile, I suggest I cut to one G and that Mom fixes us some grub.","""Maybe we do sort of like each other, after all.""","Swiftly then he ran to his own pack, climbed in and fastened the straps.","Has something to do with sizes and densities, I believe--but I'm not sure even of that.","""Sure, Mother, there can be life-forms anywhere.","""How's the temp outside?""","Strap down,"" Jon called into the intercom.","""Oh, that's right.","""If Bogin is trying to get this claim--and now we know he is--he'll work out some way of getting pictures and records, too.","Then he grasped the vine firmly with both hands, a few inches in front of his chest.",Mrs.,His mother came over and ran her hand gently through his hair.,"""There's one sure thing.","And in a moment the older boy found it easier to get the sandwiches and bottles of nourishing broth their mother had prepared before take-off, and distribute them to the others.",He hoped he could do it when the time came.,"It'd be easy to open it later.""","""We'll have to figure out where to lay out our townsite, and which planet is best to put it on.""",I second Jon's plan to go out.,"After seeing her answering wave, they plunged into the forest at a point where they saw a trail, left either by the frequent passings of the great triped they had shot, or by other beasts of some type not yet seen.","Nevertheless, it was the sudden ringing of an alarm bell that woke them all into instant, wondering wakefulness.","""We'll be back long before dark.""","""I think I've figured out the theodolite well enough to tell if our lines are straight, and that's what we're using now,"" Jon continued.","I'll be right back.""","""We'll yell if anything especially interesting shows up,"" Jak called as she was leaving.",The two phrases came simultaneously from Jak and his mother.,Must be the usual thing here.,"""I'm proud of you all.""","Beneath them the land was sliding by, as the ship cruised at the slow speed, for it, of just under a thousand miles an hour.","""My height-to-descent-speed ratio was off a bit, and that was what I had to fix.""","""Well,"" philosophically, ""you'll probably learn as you grow older ... if you live that long!""","But fix your pack so you can be sure of getting in without any trouble.""",The worried look came back into her eyes.,"""If Bogin holds his acceleration, plus and minus, we can take most of the day, and still beat him in.""","""Better touch it in a few places, then, to make sure.""","""Ask some astronomer, not me.","""Cold.","""Gens on.""",The two others gasped as they saw the ground rushing toward them so swiftly.,"""Yes, guess you're right.""","""Why don't we circle around a bit and look for our townsite from the air?"""
