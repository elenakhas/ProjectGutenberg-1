The mother found them at last; she had suspected that they had taken refuge in Paula's room.,"""Do tell me, doctor, will her arm be lame?",Dora!,"and Wili and Lili jumped about more than ever, crying out, ""Yes, yes, Rolf wrote it, but we planned it all out and he made the verses, and Jule put up the poles and then we fetched the fir twigs.""","""Well, then try this one, try hard.","then you are as old as Paula;"" said Lili regretfully, who had hoped that Dora would belong to her in every respect, even in age.","Aunt Ninette was much gratified by this courtesy, and accepted it with pleasure; quite forgetting the noise of the children, which had been so great a bugbear to her.","""There is just such a dwelling as you describe, now ready for lodgers.","I had such an experience myself, and the memory of that happy time is dear to me even now!""",If they had only moved away at once!,"Then Wili repeated after his mother a short prayer, and never had he prayed so earnestly as now, with his heart full of dread for the results of his naughty conduct.","It was arranged that directly after dinner Dora should go over into the garden, and stay there till late in the evening.","""I will make you a proposal, my son,"" said Uncle Titus, as he rose from his seat, and prepared to return to the cottage; ""Come to me here every evening, and bring me the fresh set.","asked the father, when they were at last all busy over their plates.","""So the years passed, and no thought of coming sorrow and separation crossed our young lives, until one day, when we were nearly twelve years old, my father told me--I remember the very spot in the garden where we were standing at that moment--that Mr. Blank, Lili's father, was about to give up his factory and return to Germany.",But his mother would not admit the resemblance.,"""Now see, mine can,"" said the little boy, who did not like to be called stupid, and he tied his handkerchief round the neck of the long suffering nutcracker and dragged it after him up and down the room, lifting it up now and then at regular intervals.","have you quite forgotten your father's verses?""","""Oh Aunty, look!","To lose Lili, and to have her lose all her property, were two things which made my life unhappy for a long, long time.","And from these heavenly messengers the lonely child gained nightly comfort when she climbed to her little chamber in the roof, with her feeble candle for her only companion.","""Something is amiss,"" said the man to himself; and taking a long bean-pole on his shoulder, in case it should be needed, he followed Schnurri to the wash-house.","me higher still!""",The mother was silent; a very sad expression rested upon her face.,"But never again did she dare even to speak of music, no matter how eagerly she had listened to the piano, during her long sewing lessons.","She came back at once at the sound of her aunt's voice, and took her appointed place at the window where she was to sit and sew all day.",They carried the bow back to its place in silence.,"We promised to be always true to each other, and to use every effort to meet again; and then we sat down together and composed a last poem, for we had often written verses together.",But it was a long time before the impression was effaced from the child's imagination.,"He assured her that the wound was doing perfectly well, and that there was not the slightest danger of any permanent stiffness of the arm; though he laughingly owned that he had made the worst of it to Dora, in order to impress her with caution for the future.",Poor little Dora!,"""No; Miss Hanenwinkel will not teach me another till I have learned my exercises better; but I know what I will do, Dora, just wait till to-morrow, and then I will give you music lessons, and we will learn ever so many tunes.","""No, Rolf"" she said quickly, ""thank you very much, but no more to-night.","""I combine the agreeable with the useful,"" said Julius gaily, returning his father's embrace.",Stop!,"""Yes, decidedly;"" replied Mrs. Ehrenreich, ""we shall move on Monday.""","""I am fully convinced of the absolute necessity of our immediate departure,"" said Aunt Ninette, with emphasis.","Dora sprang up hastily when she noticed how dark it had grown, and recollected that her aunt would be expecting her.","Then followed a long, long winter with its cold and darkness; such cold that Dora often thought that even the hot summer days were better, for she no longer dared to open the window to look for her friends the stars, and often she could hardly get to sleep, it was so cold in the little room, under the roof.","The consequences may be very serious, and the matter must not be lightly treated.","The sound of the family coming back from church, added to their embarrassment.","It looks like an enchanted spot, and now for my favorite apple-tree.""",But go--no--come here to the water.,The doctor came as quickly as possible.,"You can never sew any more, nor do anything else!","The idea of this coming freedom almost overcame her with its bewildering delight, after all those long, long days in the seamstress' little, stifling room.","For I had no such outfit for my dolls as you children have now, no sofas and chairs and other furniture.","""Why, it can cover--well--the shell covers it.""",He defended himself to the best of his ability.,"He went on down stairs still laughing, and just at the front door met his mother.","They gathered up their work and books, and returned slowly to the house under the triumphal arch that still spanned the garden-door of the house.",But what will be the end if this is the beginning?,"cried his mother, now thoroughly alarmed, for she instantly recalled having seen the doctor hurry by to the cottage when they were at dinner.",A FRIGHTFUL DEED.,"However, perhaps there would be less noise over the hedge after this, and the windows could be opened!","and before Dora could protest, the indefatigable riddle-maker declaimed:     ""My fickle first is said to be      England's high-road of industry;      But Germany denies the same      And with a _Key_ she makes her claim.",and he read it aloud.,"Meantime, Schnurri, all dripping-wet, ran to the shed where Battiste was shaping bean-poles for the kitchen garden.","""There, there, I hope I did not hurt you,"" he said, tapping the frightened child upon the shoulder.","Lately I have not thought of it at all, but telling you the story of my early friendship, brought it again to my mind.","Don't go too high up, but stay there six weeks at least.","""I believe we have a riddle-fever, and one catches it from another.","Her father had told her that God would always help those who trusted him and prayed to him, and she had no fear.","cried Aunt Ninette in her most plaintive tone, running down the stairs to overtake him.","Going down stairs, he met Miss Hanenwinkel.","If your choice falls on the twins, you will be torn in two, and as to little Hunne; if you go with him he will talk you deaf!""",Those visits seemed to me like prolonged festivals.,"Hunne carefully divided each kernel, giving one half to Jule, while he popped the other into his own little mouth.","Her timidity came back again, at seeing the parents, for she had expected to see only the children.",said Uncle Titus tapping the lad kindly on the shoulder.,"Then she explained to Lili that when they had enough water, they could push the spout away from the log, and when they wanted it again, they could lift it up and put it into the log themselves.","Before she knew it, the time had come, and her aunt said, ""Now, Dora, you can go!""","He rushed back to the house, calling out, ""Jule, Paula, did you know that the twins shot a child yesterday?""","When the widow had talked herself out, Mrs. Birkenfeld asked if she could speak to the lady, and to the little girl who had been hurt.","Mrs. Ehrenreich wrote immediately, setting forth her wishes at full length and in great detail.","Here Lili found him, and she planted herself before him with her hands behind her back, just as she had seen her papa stand, when giving orders.","Her aunt cast a rapid glance from the window, and saw that this was true; everything was dark, even the last lantern extinguished.",At this moment the big bell rang for supper.,"Early the next day, as Julius was clattering along the passage with his big riding-boots and spurs, he heard the sounds of practising in the school-room, and knowing that Miss Hanenwinkel did not give lessons at this hour, he pushed open the door to see what was going on.",Stop playing with the nuts and I will crack some more for you bye and bye.,Suddenly a new fear seized them.,"But she did not wake up, except to find that her plate had been loaded with good things, so very real, that all anxiety passed away, and she realized that she was living, and living remarkably well, into the bargain.",They looked at each other in great fright.
