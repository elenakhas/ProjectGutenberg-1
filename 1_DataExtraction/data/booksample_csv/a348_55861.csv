and approaching his mates exclaimed-- ""He's asleep or dead, I don't know which.","I shall invite the French, the Germans, and the Turks, and the whole lot of them, and I shall use them to beat their own relations.","He found one nearly full, and swallowed the contents, wiping his mouth with his sleeve, and then shook the captain by the shoulder.","The rest of the silent dark figures sat or lay about in various positions, and these ragged objects were scarcely distinguishable in the twilight from the heaps of rubbish half overgrown with weeds which were strewn about the yard.","Vaviloff turned green, and stared at Kouvalda with wide-open eyes.","One fine day at the end of September Captain Kouvalda sat, as was his custom, in his arm-chair at the door of the doss-house looking at the big brick building erected by the merchant Petounnikoff by the side of Vaviloff's vodka shop.","Two dark figures entered the yard and approached the group of men seated round the vodka barrel, one of them asking in a hoarse voice-- ""You are drinking?""","""They're a silly race--a dull set of wooden blockheads; but let us hope that this renewed energy of the Zemstvo, this increase of schools, this enlightenment, this education""-- ""Schools!","I spit at all and everything, and life for me is like a mistress who has deserted me.","The captain rose to his feet, yawned loudly, and stretched himself till his bones cracked.","The bottle was near, but it proved to be--empty.",An hour and more passed in this silent expectation.,The devil!,"""Yes, there is one to-day.","""Well, what of that?""","""Speak according to the Bible!","""You must begin to improve it!""","""We are not good people, you damned old shopkeeper!""","""I'm curious, for--it's such fine work, you see.",You don't know where we were when Jesus was on earth.,"""Jakoff will die before we get there;

the schoolmaster is missing, but some other waifs and strays are sure to turn up, so let's say twenty.",suddenly cried the old lady to Semka.,"""I'll go and give him a knock over the head,"" proposed Martianoff.",that's what is the matter.,"began Semka, as soon as we were outside the gate.","Tiapa turned his back on the schoolmaster, and both returned to the yard, and rejoined the company.","replied the other, smiling.","cried the driver, shaking the reins on the horse's back.","Birch rods cost the peasant nothing, whereas education strips him bare to the skin, and causes him more suffering than can any rod.","After that they attack the police news, and law cases.",The judge watched him from the corner of his eye.,"All knew Petounnikoff, who often passed near them, blinking his eyes disdainfully, and paying as little attention to them as he did to the rest of the rubbish lying about in the yard.","Have you ever read the Bible?""",But now the shopkeeper's pocket and his self-esteem were going to be hurt by one of themselves!,"asked ""Scraps,"" turning his shrewd face round to the captain.","what then?""",Do you hear that?,"""Some of the houses are tumbling down already.""","Can't understand it, still you feel it's a word for the soul.""",Wasn't that an excellent joke?,"There is sawdust, trash, and refuse of all sorts in this bread;
