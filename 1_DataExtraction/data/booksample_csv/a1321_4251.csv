remember the occasion.","""It depends on what view you take of it,""--I said, laying down my work and trying to fix her attention, a matter which was always difficult--""We human beings are composed of good and evil particles.","I tried to smile in response, but I felt far more ready to weep.","""Poor child!""","I will not look at you as a thing that can or would do me harm, and therefore I am coming to you to find out your meaning!","As I did so, leaning a little over the ledge, something soft and velvety touched my hand;--it was a red rose clambering up the turret just within my reach.",It has done me good to talk to you and tell you all my sad little history.,"A golden moon looked warmly in between the giant branches, flooding the darkness of the scene with rippling radiance, and within its light two human beings walked,--a man and woman--their arms round each other,--their faces leaning close together.",I looked about me--and smiled as I saw the impossibility of any escape.,"You have studied long and deeply--you have worked hard at problems which puzzle the strongest man's brain, and you have succeeded in many things because you have kept what most men manage to lose when grappling with Science,--Faith.","He looked earnestly in my face--then laid his hands on my head in a mute blessing, and signed to me to pass into my turret room.","he said, laughing--""The owner, according to your Highland fellow, has the same blossoms on board,--probably gathered from the same morass!--surely this is quite romantic and exciting!""","They revelled in sunshine and open air, and found all sorts of excuses for their own faults, provided they got some pleasure out of them.","Yet I don't know how I knew her, or where I met her--a woman who, for some reason or other, was hateful to me because I was jealous of her!",A disagreeable line furrowed the corners of his mouth.,"Know yourself as part of the Divine Spirit of all things, and be divine in your own creative existence.","What other thing created or imagined can be compared to the joy of thee?--to the sweetness of thy lips, the softness of thy bosom--the love that trembles into confession with thy smile!","I gently moved aside the table on which I had been writing, and stood up.","*     *     *                             *     *                                * The cool, spacious interior of a marble-pillared hall or studio slowly disclosed itself to my view--it was open to an enchanting vista of terraced gardens and dark undulating woods, and gay parterres of brilliant blossom were spread in front of it like a wonderfully patterned carpet of intricate and exquisite design.","We rose and paced the deck slowly, gradually dividing in couples, Catherine and Dr. Brayle--Mr. Harland and his secretary,--Santoris and myself.","It will not be safe for her to attempt any excursion today.""","Would you tell Dr. Brayle that I shall be ready for him in ten minutes?""","Mr. Harland gave a short, derisive laugh--""Why, he's over sixty if he's a day!","""Impostor is a strong word!",I say if we could only find a way!,"""Enigmatical, as usual!""",--said Mr. Harland.,"""I am not unwilling to recognise any true thing,"" I said--""But I do not wish to be deceived--or to deceive myself.""","I waited, full of eager anticipation,--and presently the low vibrating sound of the organ trembled on the air, gradually increasing in volume and power till a magnificent rush of music poured from it like a sudden storm breaking through clouds.","Take us, O Light!","""From Eternal Life no death can come,""--continued the Voice--""from Eternal Love flows Eternal Joy.","If you would let me, I would be sufficient for you.""","Have you seen her?""",Was I not myselt the witness of his altered mind?,"It is, of course, a 'craze'--but craze or not, he is absolutely immovable on one point which he calls the great Fact of Life,--that there is and can be no Death,--that Life is eternal and therefore in all its forms indestructible.""","""-he queried, glancing at me--""Does she 'express' herself in radiance?""",Have yet a little patience!,"It has been a joy to meet you, if only for a little while--a pause in the journey,--an attempt at an understanding!--though you have decided that we must part again.""","""He is the same man,""--answered Mr. Harland, rather testily--""There are no two of his kind in the world.""",Mr. Harland glanced at me and laughed.,"Each nation envies or despises the other,--each man struggles against his fellow-man and grudges his neighbour every small advantage,--and more than all, each Creed curses the other, blasphemously calling upon God to verify and fulfil the curse!","You were pointed out to me as a ""psychist""--and while I was still listening to what was being said about you, my father came up with you on his arm and introduced us.",But then the question presented itself--What had I gained?,His eyes were luminous and compassionate.,"I asked, smiling.","--put in Fazio--""They would have to learn their trade all over again.","I have sometimes doubted even your good intentions towards me.""","""You surely didn't think she was in any danger?""","""Well, what is it?""",It was a horrible dream!--it seemed so real!,What did they mean?,"He lifted his hands in a kind of appealing astonishment, and the woman smiled sadly.",Aselzion smiled.,"For some time I remained awake on my hard little couch, looking at this ray, and steadily refusing to allow any sense of fear or loneliness to gain the mastery over me--the music which had so enchanted me ceased--and everything was perfectly still.",A keen and watchful interest flashed over his dark face.,"I leaned out of the window, and my eyes rested on the little crimson rose that still blossomed against the wall in fragrant confidence.",No!,"There is nothing very difficult in it.""","For instance, you are in pain now?""","""Go on!""",With the rush of startled recollection I found my voice.,"""It is indeed a 'Dream'!""","Long lines of delicate pale blue and green were now intermingled with the amber light of the after-glow, and the whole scene was one of indescribable grandeur and beauty.",I lifted my eyes to his.,I smiled.,You dream--and your life is that of vision simply.,"The voice was sharp and thin, and we turned round amazed to see Catherine standing in the doorway of the saloon, white and trembling, with wild eyes looking as though they saw ghosts.","""So your doctor came to look after you,""--he said, with a smile--""I thought he would not trust you out of his sight too long!""","Gradually my blood cooled, and in a few minutes I found myself smiling at my own absurdly useless indignation.","I left my rocky throne and heather canopy with slow reluctance, and he saw this.","""And that is--what?""","""Those drops you gave me are magical, Santoris!""",He could not actually perish--but he could be parted from me as he had been parted before--and I--I should be alone again--alone as I had been all my life!,"""That his age!""","If you are, the fault is in yourself, not in me!'","Without you I am--can be nothing--Cosmo de Medicis--"" At this name a kind of shadow crept upon the scene, together with a sense of cold.","I looked at him half in fear, half in appeal, as he sat in the boat with his head turned a little aside from me,--he seemed grave and preoccupied.","""Results?","That is a problem to me,--and I should like to solve it.""","A curious expression came into his eyes, as of hidden fear.","At any rate something keen, fine and subtle stole over my senses, moving me to an intense delight in merely being alive.","""Oh, not at all, sir, if you are satisfied,""--Derrick answered."
