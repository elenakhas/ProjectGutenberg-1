But what the native thought or felt had no significance; what counted was the beast ahead.,"Foolish thing to do, he thought, to camp so near the slope.","""Why, ours, of course,"" said Sipar, and went back to sleep.","""You should know,"" Duncan told it.","But loyal to what, Duncan wondered, to him, the outlander and intruder?","Then he could go back across the days that he had left behind him, back to the farm and field, back into that misty other life from which he had been so mysteriously divorced, but which in time undoubtedly would become real and meaningful again.","When morning came, Duncan and Sipar climbed the scarp, clambering over the boulders and the tons of soil and rock that covered their camping place.",But they stopped and moved no farther.,It was the sense of being watched.,he called.,"Duncan slowly swiveled, rifle held almost at arm's length, elbows crooked a little, ready to bring the weapon into play in a fraction of a second.",It knows more than it's telling.,"The beasts sniffed and clawed at the thorns to reach them, but finally went away.","And Sipar--Sipar lying by the fire, curled up and sound asleep already.",This time there will be no slip-up.,"Duncan tried to make out the size and shape, but it blended with the grass and the dun soil and he could not be sure exactly what it looked like.",It didn't seem to be there at all.,"""Why did you hunt me?""","The best thing to do, he decided, was to dig the ground away beneath his foot until he could pull it out.","""But I do not want to kill.","""Supper.""",The beast had been traveling fast.,"The Cytha, more than likely, was mother-father, incubator, nursery, teacher and perhaps many other things besides, all rolled into one.",They might not recognize me until too late.,"Behind him, a pebble came bumping down the slope.",He got up from the table and went to the heavy chest that stood against one wall.,They dragged more wood out of the thicket and piled it carefully close at hand.,"He lay back, defeated, breathing hard, wringing wet with perspiration.","*       *       *       *       * In one leap, he was at Sipar's side.","He flicked the control on the rifle back to single fire, crawled around the rock pile and sprinted for a grove of trees that stood on higher ground.",They reached the forest bank and threw themselves flat to rest.,There was no profit in rage.,"""Sipar!""",He picked them up and tossed them in the fire.,"With all your tricks, you couldn't do the job until.... Then he remembered.",Trap?,"Looking straight at Duncan, with the flicker of a smile upon its lips, the native cut its throat.",There was not a breath of moving air.,This was nothing new to him.,The little area ahead was smoother than it should be.,It would do away with the inconvenience and the irritability and the discontentment of intelligence when intelligence was unneeded.,"While it might be unexciting, it did seem downright peaceful.",You figured out the problem and you picked the course that seemed best and you didn't panic at the odds.,"""Sipar, what do you actually know about the Cytha?""","*       *       *       *       * Food-giver, eh?",He crouched behind the jumbled rocks and peered ahead.,One able to develop intelligence and abilities to meet each new situation and then lapsing back to the level of non-intelligent contentment?,"It's still out there.""",The hula-trees shimmered in the blaze of sun and the thorn-bush was gray and lifeless and the only things astir were three stilt-birds walking gravely a quarter of a mile away.,The canteens were all they had lost--the canteens and the fire.,"This was new land, never seen before by any Earthman.","Oh, clever, clever Cytha!","Unkillable because, pressed, it could fashion a bow and arrow, however crude?",They waded out into the stream.,It would be all over less than a minute after he opened fire.,"Something is running there.""",They were sure of him and there was no hurry.,His thumb slid up the metal and nudged the fire control to automatic and he flexed his legs beneath him so that he could rise and fire in one single motion.,You go downstream.,"Sipar was dead and there was no one else--and yet someone had spoken to him, and there could be only one thing in all this wilderness that might speak to him.",Everything here was kin to everything else.,"It was acting like an animal that was gaining savvy and determination, and that was somehow frightening.",The bottom shelved gradually and they had to swim no more than a hundred yards or so.,"It had somehow fitted back into its natural shape and it was a baby screamer--well, maybe not a baby, but at least a tiny screamer.","And through the months and years, the Cytha would grow, with the growing of its diverse children, until it became a monstrous thing.","He threw up an arm across his face, with the elbow crooked, to take the impact of the wind-blown Cytha and to ward it off.","And he was astonished at how calm, how coldly objective he could be, now that the chips were down.","There was more than one of them, of course.","Another day might make some sense of it, might banish the dread walker that trod upon his heels, might bring some peace of mind.","""Some playground that must have been,"" said Duncan.","For the moment, the _vua_ crop was safe.","_Skun!_"" ""I don't--"" ""Out there, mister.","The little scurrying things had given up; they'd gone back to their places, clustered around the pulsing violet of the Thanksgiving skeleton, each one fitting into place until the Cytha had taken shape again.","*       *       *       *       * Progressive adaptation, he told himself.","He held the rifle across his knees and stroked it, polishing it, petting it, making it even more closely a part of him, an instrument of his deadliness, an expression of his determination to track and kill the Cytha.","And it was queer, he thought.","Duncan poured porridge gruel into his bowl, handed the pan to Shotwell.",The rifle bucked hard against his shoulder and the report hammered in his head and the beast went down.,"Fed to hogs, made into corn-pone for breakfast back on Earth, and here, on Layard, the staple food crop for a gang of shiftless varmints who still regarded, with some good solid skepticism and round-eyed wonder, this unorthodox idea that one should take the trouble to grow plants to eat rather than go out and scrounge for them.",Nothing stirred.,"""Not that I ever heard of.""","And if it were a trap, he would have fallen into it if he had kept on following as he had started out.",They reached the bottom of the escarpment as the brief twilight closed in and they hurried to gather firewood.
