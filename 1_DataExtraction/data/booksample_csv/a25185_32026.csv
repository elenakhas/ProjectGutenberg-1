"It was something more than that, some weird entangling of the Cytha's meaning with his own.","""You have no Cytha taboo, then.""","Safer here.""",They had been mangled by his bullet.,It stayed where it had fallen.,"Scared of it is all.""","Where it had run from them the day before, now it fought to shake them off.","And two days back of that lay the farm and the _vua_ field, but they seemed much farther off than that.","""It isn't much, but it gives you strength.","""Keep low.",Duncan spun around in panic.,"""Mister?""",He could do neither one.,"""I didn't think you'd do it.""",A man would faint before he got the job done.,"""Zikkara said that mister want me,"" the native told them.","He heard Sipar moving near him and reached out a hand, searching for the tracker, not knowing exactly where it was.","We can go home now.""","*       *       *       *       * ""I suppose,"" he said, ""that these other things that are your taboos, the stilt-birds and the screamers and the like, also grew up with you.""",You go downstream.,"""But it's not the lack of sex that worries me entirely,"" Shotwell said, ""although it's the central factor.","That, thought Duncan, would be a sensible way for anything to live.","And on the knoll where the thing had fallen, the grass was twitching as if the wind were blowing, only there was no wind.",Sipar waded out with the canteens and thrust them at arm's length beneath the surface to fill them.,But it didn't stop.,The canteens were all they had lost--the canteens and the fire.,And it's beside the point as well.,He cradled the rifle in his arm.,Even the leaves were silent.,"""I know that.","The executioners, he thought.","Sipar, despite its initial reluctance, had worked well at the trailing.","""Yes, mister.","The donovan would not hurt me.""",Sipar was shivering.,"It struck and crossed the river, and the river for a moment seemed to stand on end, with a sheet of silvery water splashed toward the sky.","""Well,"" said Duncan, somewhat startled, ""that is decent of you.""","At the moment, the two heavy branches, thrust into the ground on either side of his ankle, were holding most of the tree's weight off his foot.","He simply sat there, with the rifle in his lap.","Twice in the afternoon, the trail blanked out entirely and it was only after long searching that Sipar picked it up again--in one instance, a mile away from where it had vanished in thin air.",There was just one thing left.,"It might, in fact, Duncan admitted to himself, head off a lot of trouble.","In all his years of hunting, over many planets, he had never known a bullet to rip out hunks of flesh.","For it was not inconceivable that, in a crisis or a clash of interests, one might find himself faced suddenly with a unified and cooperating planet, with every form of life making common cause against the interloper.","""There's an answer, a logical explanation.",He slid the knife from his belt and looked at it.,He watched in fascination as it moved along the river and saw the boiling fury it made out of the forest.,"He tried to crawl and couldn't, for something had grabbed him by the ankle and was hanging on.",The Cytha certainly had not wasted any time.,"""Not at the price they'd charge to ship it out,"" said Duncan.","""Let's go.""",He'd been in tight spots before.,"He tried to shrug it off, but it still stayed with him, just out of reach.","""Dead center,"" Duncan assured himself.","The extra drum of ammunition and the knife were on his belt, the bag of rockahominy in his pocket.","""Sipar!""",Especially the third one from him.,"""Don't strain yourself,"" said Duncan.","The beasts sniffed and clawed at the thorns to reach them, but finally went away.","Finally the first light of morning began to filter through the forest and it was not the glaring, clean white light of the open plain and bush, but a softened, diluted, fuzzy green light to match the smothering vegetation.",We could crawl inside.,"""You know who I am?""","There were three small gouts of torn, mangled fur and flesh lying on the ground and there was nothing else.","The hole was less than an arm's length away from him, with a little debris around its edges still trickling into it.","Beneath the thin covering of humus, he struck a solid surface and his fingers slid along it.","While it might be unexciting, it did seem downright peaceful.","A misplaced bunch of grass, a twig bent to one side, a displaced stone, the faintest pug mark were Sipar's stock in trade.",He got up a little stiffly.,"""Little pattering.",That vanishing bothered Duncan more than he would admit.,"Just one second, or even less, to draw a steady bead.","""Not even sisterhood.","And that was a good one, he thought with grim irony, because they had no shape.","In two quick strides, the beast could be upon him.",Yours wouldn't take a shot at us.,There were tiny screamers and some donovans and sawmill birds and a bevy of kill-devils and something else as well.,Sipar caught it deftly.,"The day before, the Cytha had only run away, straight-line fleeing to keep ahead of them, to stay out of their reach.","""I think so,"" Sipar answered.","And that night beside the waterhole, it had spied on him, again in the form of all its separate parts, from the safety of the thicket.",Duncan paid no attention.,"There was more than one of them, of course.","Now there was something else, a strange uneasiness, and he stirred uncomfortably, casting frantically for some clue to what it was."
