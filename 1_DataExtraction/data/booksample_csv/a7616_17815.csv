"In the case of works of history and fiction, which adopt the narrative tense, this tendency to a subsequent illusion of memory is strengthened by the disposition of the mind at the moment of reading to project itself backwards as in an act of recollection.","[62] These include profound emotional changes, which affect the ruling mental tone, and exert a powerful influence on the course of the mental images.","Thus, for example, we fall into the illusion of hearing two voices when our shout is echoed back, just because the second auditory impression irresistibly calls up the image of a second shouter.",The superstitious man talks of being led by some good or evil spirit when new ideas arise in his mind or new resolutions shape themselves.,Any sudden alteration of our bodily appearance sensibly impedes the movement of imagination.,"Metempsychosis, 294.",It is plain that the external conditions of life impose on the individual certain habits of feeling which often conflict with his personal propensities.,"So frequent is it, indeed, that one might almost say there is no dream in which it is not one great determining factor.","We have no occasion to revert to them, and if by chance we are afterwards reminded of them, they are pretty certain to look too near, just because the fact of their having greatly interested us has served to render their images particularly vivid.","If I try to localize in time a remote event, I am content with placing it in relation to a series of prominent events or landmarks which serves me as a rough scheme of the past.","With respect to subjective sensations of smell and taste, there is little to be said.",This accounts for the gradual displacement of the impression of the moment by the mental image.,"It is not at all unlikely that the several confusions of self touched on in this chapter have had something to do with the genesis of the various historical theories of a transformed existence, as, for example, the celebrated doctrine of metempsychosis.","As a last example, it may be said that the mind's certain conviction of the innateness of some of its ideas resembles those illusions of memory which arise through an inability to think ourselves back into a remote past having a type of consciousness widely unlike that of the present.","And it is exceedingly curious to notice the different directions which patients give to these sounds, referring them now to a quarter above the head, now to a region below the floor, and so on.","[23] The conditions of the production of these double images have been accurately determined by Helmholtz, who shows that the coalescence of impressions takes place whenever the object is so situated in the field of vision as to make it practically necessary that it should be recognized as one.","""[134] We see, then, that the failure of our ordinary assurance of personal identity is due to the recognition of difference without similarity.","Thus, the poet personifies nature in part because his emotional cravings prompt him to construct the idea of something that can be admired or worshipped.","External sensations come in groups, too, but as a rule they do not fuse in apparently simple wholes as our internal feelings often do.",CHAPTER I.,"On the other hand, the confusion which arises from too great and violent a transformation of our _remembered_ experiences is much less easily corrected.","[19] Two or more simultaneous sensations are indistinguishable from one another, not only when they have nearly the same local origin, but under other circumstances.","Or, to express it physically, we assume that the external force acting on the sense-organ invariably produces the same effect, and that the effect always varies with the external cause.","v., ""The Genesis of the Free-Will Doctrine."")","Thus, the ascription of beauty to one's native village, to one's beloved friends, and so on, in so far as it carries the conviction of objective worth, may imply a confusion of the individual with the common experience.","On the one hand, it closely resembles sense-perception, since it proceeds by the interpretation of a sense-impression by means of a representative image.",Ribot.,"But in our present state of knowledge, any reasoning on this supposition would probably appear too fanciful.","If, as we have found some of the best authorities saying, we are, when asleep, always dreaming more or less distinctly, and if, as we know, dreaming is a continual process of transformation of our waking impressions in new combinations, it is not surprising that our dreams should sometimes take the form of forecasts of our waking life, and that consequently objects and scenes of this life never before seen should now and again wear a familiar look.","Thus organic processes which scarcely make themselves known to the mind in a waking state, may be shown to be the originators of many of our dreams.","This being so, we may very roughly describe all illusion as abnormal.","All agree that what is called beauty consists, to a considerable extent, of a power of awaking pleasant suggestions, but in order that these should constitute a ground of aesthetic value, they must be common, participated in by all, or at least by an indefinite number.",Intuition.,"That is to say, there may be a disposition, permanent or temporary, to ascribe a certain kind of feeling to others in accordance with our wishes, fears, and so on.",And in this way a good deal of petty illusion arises.,"Just as the centres concerned in passive sensation are susceptible of central stimulation, so are the centres concerned in muscular sensation.","And just as we distinguished between those hallucinations of sense which arise first of all through some peripherally caused subjective sensation, and those which want even this element of reality and depend altogether on the activity of imagination, so we may mark off two classes of mnemonic hallucination.",[Illustration: FIG.,"There is a sort of overlapping of the mental images, and so an appearance of continuity produced in some respects analogous to that which arises in the wheel-of-life (thaumatrope) class of sense-illusions.","All of us frequently have incomplete visual and auditory hallucinations of the first order, whereas the complete hallucinations of the second order are comparatively rare.","Again, he assumes the uniformity of nature, the universality of the causal relation, and so on.","So my belief in Cicero's oratory resolves itself into the conviction that I should have heard Cicero under certain conditions of time and place, which is identical with my expectation that I shall hear a certain speaker to-morrow if I go to the House of Commons.","The intensity of the expectation of a particular kind of object excludes calm attention to what really happens, and the slightest impressions which answer to signs of the object anticipated are instantly seized by the mind and worked up into illusory perceptions.",And now we see what constitutes the object of insight.,"Closely connected with these illusions of direction with respect to resting objects, are those into which we are apt to fall respecting the movements of objects.","Whether psychology as a positive science can ever be sure of this: whether, that is to say, it can answer the question, ""How do we come by the idea of object?""","Thus organic processes which scarcely make themselves known to the mind in a waking state, may be shown to be the originators of many of our dreams.","As I have already remarked, active illusion has for its physiological basis a state of sub-excitation, or an exceptional condition of irritability in the structures engaged in the act of interpretative imagination.","As a member of society he has a powerful motive to attribute certain feelings to himself, and this motive acts as a bias in disturbing his vision of what is actually in his mind.",Hence a deeply organized habit of taking these impressions as answering to the solid and not to the flat.,"The superior vividness of the external impression cannot leave us in any doubt, when calm and self-possessed, whether our mental images answer to present realities or not.","p. 273, etc; Wundt, _Physiologische Psychologie_, p. 653.","The same is true when I can recall an event pretty distinctly, but fail to assign it its proper date.","It is a trite remark that there is a large individual factor, a considerable ""personal equation,"" in matters of taste, as in other matters.","Mill distinguishes expectation as a radically distinct mode of belief from memory, but does not bring out the contrast with respect to activity here emphasized (James Mill's _Analysis of the Human Mind_, edited by J.S.","The mystery of the process, however, greatly disappears when it is remembered that what we call a conscious ""sensation"" is really compounded of a result of sensory stimulation and a result of central reaction, of a purely passive impression and the mental activity involved in attending to this and classing it.",[60] _The Hallucinations of Insanity._ The hallucinations of the insane are but a fuller manifestation of forces that we see at work in normal life.,"In the second place, the pre-existing mental states at the time of revival are essential conditions.",One morning she related the following dream to her father (I use her own language).,"Introspection is confined to feelings which want this intimate connection with the external region, and includes sensation only so far as it is viewed apart from external objects and on its mental side as a feeling, a process which is next to impossible where the sensation has little emotional colour, as in the case of an ordinary sensation of sight or of articulate sound.","If we could go deeply enough into the matter, we should, of course, be able to explain why this particular confusion arose.","_Simple Illusory Belief_:--       (1) Expectation: its nature, 297, 298; Is Expectation ever intuitive?","My idea of a particular friend contains, among other things, numbers of vague representations of his habitual modes of feeling and acting, and numbers of still more vague expectations of how he will or might feel and act in certain circumstances.","We may even go further, and say that in the analysis and explanation of illusion the psychologist may be expected to do more than the physician.","This retrospective appreciation is determined by the number and the degree or intensity of the experiences, and, what comes very much to the same thing, by the amount of unlikeness, freshness, and discontinuity characterizing these experiences.","Introspection is presentative in the sense that the reality constituting the object of cognition, the mind's present feeling, is as directly present to the knowing mind as anything can be conceived to be.","_Hallucinations of Normal Life._ In normal life, perfect hallucinations, in the strict sense as distinct from illusions, are comparatively rare.","Now, I am not concerned here to inquire into the logical value of this transition, but simply to point out that it is extra-scientific and distinctly philosophic.","This being so, it would seem to follow that the greater the number of clearly marked changes, and the more impressive and exciting these transitions, the fuller will be our sense of time.","YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.",This coalescence of two sensations is so far erroneous since it makes us overlook the existence of two distinct external agencies acting on different parts of the sensitive surface of the body.,"And so it seems probable that any mental image which happens to take hold on the mind, if not recognized as one of memory, or as corresponding to a fact in somebody else's experience, naturally assumes the form of an expectation of a personal experience.","Commonly, the conviction seems to be only definable as an assurance of a superlative of which the positive and comparative are suppressed.","Just as we have found that our environment helps to determine our idea of self and personal continuity, so, conversely, our inner experience, our remembered or imagined joys and sorrows throw a reflection on the outer world, giving it its degree of worth.",My habitual idea of a person is a resultant of forces of memory conjoined with other forces.,A passenger steps out of the train bearing a superficial resemblance to his friend; in consequence of which he falls into the error of false identification.,This question was partly opened up at the close of the last chapter.,"Our idea of any stage of our past history, as early childhood, or school days, is built up out of a few fragmentary intellectual relics which cannot be certainly known to answer to the most important and predominant experiences of the time.",Scientific inquiry is often said to destroy all beautiful thoughts about nature and life; but while it destroys it creates.,"The coloured plates were due probably to subjective optical sensations simultaneously excited, which were made to fit in (with or without an effort of voluntary attention) with the image of the book under the form of illustrations.","This is, in part, a common experience, as in the case of sense-perception and aesthetic intuition, since to perceive another's feeling is implicitly to cognize the external conditions of a common insight.",In many of our instantaneous perceptions these two stages are indistinguishable to consciousness.,"These so-called philosophical illusions will be found, like the vulgar ones just spoken of, to illustrate the distinction drawn between passive and active illusions."
