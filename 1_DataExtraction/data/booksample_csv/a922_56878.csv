"The last partitions have fallen--and our love has become so calm, so profound, every breach has vanished so completely, leaving no trace behind it, that we do not even wish to exchange a word, a glance.... We only wish to breathe, to breathe together, to live together, to be together, ... and not even to be conscious of the fact that we are together.... XI Or, in conclusion, there presents itself to me a clear September morning when thou and I were walking together through the deserted garden, as yet not wholly out of bloom, of an abandoned palace, on the bank of a great non-Russian river, beneath the soft radiance of a cloudless sky.",Your image is now doubly dear to me....,"Her name is Nina, Ninetta--as thou wilt; she is the daughter of a wealthy merchant here.","After exchanging the customary greetings with his new acquaintance, Astákhoff made a respectful bow to the latter’s sister.","I write to you, my dear Márya Alexándrovna, and I write only because I do not wish to die without having taken leave of you, and without having recalled myself to your mind.","“Oh, she is in love!”--I thought again.",“Yes!,So why should not he be the regulator of order?”[13] The little old man burst out laughing.,"M. B. XV _From Alexyéi Petróvitch to Márya Alexándrovna_ DRESDEN, September, 1842.",Is not Márya Pávlovna fond of poetry?” “No; she thinks all that sort of thing is made up--is all false; and she does not like that.” “A strange reproach!”--exclaimed Vladímir Sergyéitch.,"With what a face he began the mazurka, how he dragged his lady after him, how he beat the floor with his foot, and twitched his head the while,--all this is almost beyond the power of human pen to describe.",My first impulse was to flee.,"He is our stage-manager, and our prompter, and everything you like.","“Whither?”--he said, in surprise.","From the damp earth arose a strong, healthy scent; a pure, light breeze fluttered all about in cool gusts.","So then, there is a magnificent ball.","But he is so languid and petty, all his desires are so narrow, that I cannot help recognising my superiority over him; he feels this, and seems to take delight in it, and precisely that repels me from him; I cannot respect him, although he has an excellent heart.","Oh, bench on which we sat in silence, with heads drooping low with happiness--I shall never forget thee to my dying hour!--How charming were those rare passers-by with their gentle greeting and kind faces, and the large, quiet boats which floated past (on one of them--dost thou remember?--stood a horse gazing pensively at the water gliding by under its feet), the childish babble of the little waves inshore and the very barking of distant dogs over the expanse of the river, the very shouts of the corpulent under-officer at the red-cheeked recruits drilling there on one side, with their projecting elbows and their legs thrust forward like the legs of cranes!...","However, it makes no difference.","She kept her large, dark eyes almost constantly lowered.","Vladímir Sergyéitch turned round and beheld one of his best friends, a certain Mr. Pompónsky.",“Dunyáshka!”--repeated the old woman.,Are you healthy now?,They were riding side by side.,"Have the vital forces never sparkled, never seethed, never quivered in us?",“No; I have not known her very long.,That’s just like you....,"She did not catch Nadézhda Alexyéevna’s last words; but, perceiving that the glances of all present were suddenly directed to her, she immediately divined what was going on, blushed, and was about to retreat into the drawing-room.... Nadézhda Alexyéevna briskly grasped her by the hand and, with the coquettish caressing action of a kitten, drew her toward her, and kissed that almost masculine hand.","One day I was walking through the garden, past the familiar fence, when I caught sight of Zinaída.","He is a fine man; I gave him what education I could; of course, I did the best a woman could.",Tea was brought.,Accept this wish from another mortal who isn’t worth a brass farthing himself.,"You understand--after that scandal ... you must be well acquainted with all that ...” (Maidánoff smiled significantly), “it was not easy for her to find a husband; there were consequences ... but with her brains everything is possible.",His rare fits of affection for me were never called forth by my speechless but intelligible entreaties; they always came upon him without warning.,"These new, unprecedented emotions so engrossed and even cheered me, that I thought very little about Zinaída herself.","I recalled the fact that, as he came out of the house, he had given orders that his horse should be saddled.",Másha spoils you.,"Eh, by the way, yonder runs a hare....” “Where?”--asked Márya Pávlovna.","But what right have I to write to you, to talk about my friendship, my feelings, about consolation?","She seemed to be committing his features to memory, and laughed to herself from time to time.",The distance from the government capital to Sásovo was reckoned at sixty versts.,“And are you fond of gardening?”--Vladímir Sergyéitch put another question to her.,XV But art?...,"“I am a native of Little Russia,” she replied, and began to sing “Humming, humming.” At first she uttered the words in an indifferent manner; but the mournfully passionate lay of her fatherland gradually began to stir her, her cheeks flushed scarlet, her glance flashed, her voice rang out fervently.",His seat was so fine and so carelessly-adroit that the horse under him seemed to be conscious of it and to take pride in it.,"The truth--not the full truth (there can be no question of that), but even that tiny fraction which is accessible to us--immediately closes our mouths, binds our hands, and reduces “to negation.”--The only thing that is then left for a man, in order to keep erect on his feet and not crumble to dust, not to become bemired in the ooze of self-forgetfulness, is self-scorn; is to turn calmly away from everything and say: “It is enough!”--and folding his useless arms on his empty breast to preserve the last, the sole merit which is accessible to him, the merit of recognising his own insignificance; the merit to which Pascal alludes, when, calling man a thinking reed, he says that if the entire universe were to crush him, he, that reed, would still be higher than the universe because he would know that it is crushing him--while it would not know that.",Truly!,"We will fight to-morrow.” “Very well.” “To-morrow morning my second will call upon you.” And with a courteous inclination, Steltchínsky withdrew, evidently well pleased with himself.",I have a commission to thee.” “Really?--I hadn’t the slightest suspicion of that.” “I’m speaking of Másha.” “On what score?” Nadézhda Alexyéevna’s face assumed a slight expression of pain.,now I am frightfully bored with myself.,"In the doorway stood a peasant-man in a new overcoat girt with a red belt, with a large beard, and an intelligent face--the overseer, judging by all the tokens.","He was a capital rider, and knew much better how to tame the wildest horses than did Mr. Rarey.",She finished.,"The former Princess Zasyékin, with whom we were all in love, you included.","I love to drink with a good friend, ma’am, sinful man that I am; I love it, ma’am.” “Stop, brother, please don’t talk like that!...","Perhaps this is all nonsense, but strange thoughts sometimes come into my head, especially when I am wakeful toward morning, when the sky is beginning to turn pink and grey.--I would, for example.... You will not laugh at me?” “No!",“Very good!,"One thing somewhat soothed me: I am convinced that you have understood under the influence of what long-suppressed feelings it was written, and have forgiven me.","I see some one galloping     On a spirited steed....     My friend, my distant friend--     Remember me!","Wait, wait!","He was delighted, sprang from his arm-chair, ran out into the anteroom and there kissed the visitor three times.","Having once become permeated with _this_ consciousness, having once tasted of _this_ wormwood, no honey will ever seem sweet--and even that loftiest, sweetest happiness, the happiness of love, of complete friendship, of irrevocable devotion--even it loses all its charm; all its worth is annihilated by its own pettiness, its brevity.","And now this was the way it had ended, this was the goal of that young, fiery, brilliant life?",He is living ... while I ... not without cause has he called me a philosopher.... ’Tis strange!,"XIX I should be hard put to it, if I were made to narrate in detail all that went on within me in the course of the week which followed my unsuccessful nocturnal expedition.",No!”--we all exclaimed with one voice.,Why can evil attract?,"Suddenly, she started, wheeled round, entered the shadow cast by a dense wall of lofty acacias, and disappeared.","The ancient park ran all the way round the pond; lindens stretched out in alleys, and stood in dense clumps; aged pine-trees, with pale yellow boles, dark oaks, magnificent maples here and there reared high in air their solitary crests; the dense verdure of the thickly-spreading lilacs and acacias advanced close up to the very sides of the two little houses, leaving revealed only their fronts, from which winding paths paved with brick ran down the slope.","She is a great friend of my sister-in-law, and bears good will to our household in general.” “A whole formal inventory,”--said Nadézhda Alexyéevna, laughing, and, as before, scanning Vladímir Sergyéitch from under her hat.",Márya Pávlovna had made an impression on him.,Evidently you called me to mind for the lack of something to do.,"“The flirt!”--thought Vladímir Sergyéitch, and taking his hat in his hand, he slipped unnoticed from the hall, hunted up his footman, to whom he had previously given orders to hold himself in readiness, and was already donning his overcoat, when suddenly, to his intense surprise, the lackey informed him that it was impossible to depart, as the coachman, in some unknown manner, had drunk to intoxication, and that it was utterly impossible to arouse him.","The young neighbour may be a good man, but I throw him over!","I’ve forgotten the other man’s name....” “Pythion,”--remarked Iván Ílitch.","She stood before me and gazed at me--and I belonged to her wholly, from head to foot, as soon as she looked at me.... A quarter of an hour later I was running a race with the cadet and Zinaída; I was not weeping; I was laughing, although my swollen eyelids dropped tears from laughing; on my neck, in place of a tie, was bound a ribbon of Zinaída’s, and I shouted with joy when I succeeded in seizing her round the waist.",I continued to kneel and to gaze at her with profound melancholy.,"Yes, he’s done for, poor fellow.” “Akh!","In other words, and to put it simply: each person makes his own fate, and it makes each person.... Each person makes his own fate--yes!...","“Hail, life and love and happiness!”--And at that same instant, with sweetly-shattering force, similar to the flower of a cactus, there suddenly flared up within me thy image--flared up and stood there, enchantingly clear and beautiful--and I understood that I loved thee, thee alone, that I was all filled with thee.... VIII I think of thee ... and many other memories, other pictures rise up before me,--and thou art everywhere, on all the paths of my life I encounter thee.--Now there presents itself to me an old Russian garden on the slope of a hill, illuminated by the last rays of the summer sun.","I had been jealous before, but only at that moment did the thought that she had fallen in love flash through my mind.",Heads began to wax rather hot; the young men began to propose toasts.,"Don’t forget also tiger-skins and cups--and gold, a great deal of gold.” “But where is the gold to be?” inquired Maidánoff, tossing back his lank hair and inflating his nostrils."
