"I have heard that he is quite well again.” “Oh, yes, he is well enough;” the man gave a smile, which meant—a great deal better than he deserves to be—“but you must call again in the afternoon.” “Thank you.",“Not a bit of it.,"“Lots of young sparks, and bucks, and dandies, and Corinthians, and I forget what else, but all much finer than you can see now, used to come down by the coaches then, some of them driving, some blowing the horn, some upon the roof like merry-Andrews, making fools of themselves as we should call it now, and not be far wrong either.","In fact, I think I have been a fool to tell you.",I have felt enough of it; but nobody knows but myself how close I have kept it.,"Where’s your common sense, Bill?","She will soon see what I am.” “I was going to tell you, but now I had better not,” Tony Tonks answered with a sly dry smile; “what good could you do, Mr. Orchardson?","The _Simon Pure_ took letters from her, which will be received with avidity, also instructions that any letters for the members of the expedition should be addressed to Ascension Island, if posted in Great Britain before the end of November.",But I can’t take it down—even now I can’t.,"“He was sitting up very late one night, in the little room allowed to him for the various tools, and instruments, and appliances, and specimens, and all that sort of thing, which were the apple of his eye; and by a special light of his own devising he was working up the finish of some grand experiment, from which he expected great wonders, no doubt.","Although, as you know, I was against the marriage, mainly for your sake, I can assure you.",She cannot make it out any more than I can.,The ground was dry and hard just there; but I found enough to show me that I had not been deceived by any trick of the imagination.,"I was not rude enough to refuse, and that is why I am in this house again.” “You have made a fine tale of it, but not told the truth.",I want your advice.,"I have news for you, important.” What mortal, dwelling wholly on his own affairs, would not have concluded that this concerned him, on his own account, and unselfishly?","Mind, I don’t say I know what it is; but I can guess.","My father seed him often; and when he fell down, he took to walking through the fuzz.” “Oh Lor’, no more of that ’Liza!","If you call her my sister any more, I shall look upon it as an insult.” “A very great compliment, I should say,” Sir Cumberleigh pondered, when his visitor was gone; “what the deuce makes him get in such a wax about it?","My plan was to tell him that the Captain was ill, and had sent me to say that the papers were all right, but he would like to know how he got hold of them, and where he could get the others that were mentioned in them, and to pay him a sovereign, just to keep things going, till the Captain should be about again.",But of course I have no right to ask what it is.,"“I have not done so badly,” he said on Friday night; “I made a fine hit through old Roper.",Now go back to your proper work.,"But oh, I cheated them out of something, because I felt that they were cheating me.","She is a light-of-love, and a robber.",I don’t see how even a woman can make it any worse than it is.,"Here goes, neck or nort!” He had pulled out a big wall-nail with a heavy shred attached, and choosing a wide space of the wire-netting, he flung it so cleverly at the head oppressed with sorrow, that the owner jumped up, and looked about, and rubbed the eyes thereof.","I was young, and strong, and full of spirit, with the sweet words kindling in my heart, as memory stirred it from time to time; and if any one had bidden me look out for danger, I should have said, “Let me see it first.” And in this humour, I strode on, without even turning my collar up.","Haughty maidens might, according to their lights, look down on me; let them do so, it would never hurt me; I desired no haughtiness.",I must not keep him any more.,"However, as soon as I was round the corner, I slipped a pair of rubber socks, that I always carry with me, over my boots, and put myself on duty in other ways; so that if he met me in the shadow, or even ten yards from a lamp, he would have little chance of knowing me.","For it had been agony to me to think, as I could not help doing, that my own Kitty all the while was nursing bitterness against me, as if it had been possible for me to wrong her.",She’s smashed taters after the real thing.,A tender remembrance?,Though you may have thought that I was looking higher.,It was worse than useless to repine; so I turned my back to everything and went to sleep.,"At one time I began to count, as if they were a machine of which I was no longer master.","But you will oblige me more than I can say, if you will let me come again, and try to learn some little.","Let Tabby take the things away, and bring another log or two.",No Parslow was ever a beggar yet.,"Sixty thousand is a good stake to run for.” “But when is it to be, Downy, when is it to be?","I hope I have a little too much faith in you,” she said, as she came and coaxed me with her hand, making me tremble with her love and loveliness.","All this part of the house was so different from the other end that I was amazed, when I came to think of it.","How Myra allowed herself to be taken, I could never quite understand, for it was not likely to help her father in the good graces of his landlord.","I would rather lose every penny I possess, and start in the world again, as a market-porter, than let this miserable story get abroad.","He struck at me with all his force; but I dashed up his fist with my left hand, while with the right I got a firm grip upon his bulky nose.","And this had tended, more than once, to impair his popularity.","What does Teddy say to it?” “Well, you know what he is.","It is your prescription, you remember.” It was as much as my aunt could do, being of a very kindly nature, to keep a smile upon her face, when the sickly girl came towards her.","Uncle Corny, I thought you were a wiser man.” I hoped that this might lead him on.","The rooms are taken, and I cannot go alone; it would be so miserable for me.","Well, I never thought you were so clever, Kit.” “Because I never boast,” I answered calmly; and it struck him for the first time that this might be so.","She is no sister of mine, nor in any way connected.",But I never heard what she said.,Isn’t there now?” “Beyond a doubt.,How can you ever bring yourself to ask the question?,"They had not failed to make inquiry among the boatmen, and along the river; although their attention had been directed chiefly to the roads and railway.","Her taking it was robbery, and nothing else.” I laughed a little at these words, which I had heard from other quarters.","“I implore you not to do that,” I said; “really that would be too hard upon me.",But his name has escaped me for the moment.,"He shook his head very wisely over this, and told me that he must think about it; for he could not at present see the meaning of it.","They call them Touts, or Ditch-frogs, or Sky-blinkers, or half-a-dozen other names; but they get well paid, and they don’t care.","But I called him back sternly, and he said, “Oh well, if you want to hear more, you must turn into my little den down here.” I followed him through a white gate which he opened in the high paling that fenced his paddocks, and presently we came to a long low building, more like a shed than a dwelling-house, but having a snug room or two at one end.","And I believe he knows no more than this—that before they quarrelled, the younger villain made a boast of it that he would have his revenge, but never let out what his plan was.","“He had won all along the board that night, and his pockets were full of money; but instead of being up, as a decent fellow would be, he took all his luck in a cold-blooded way, just as if it were nothing to what he deserved.","If a good or evil genius had stood by Sir Cumberleigh Hotchpot, or even Downy Bulwrag, and whispered, “Have a firkin there of treble X, or Indian Pale,” there might be now no chance for Bill to tell the things he had to tell.","And she rose upon one wasted arm, and offered me a hand just like a white kid glove, that has been drawn off.","That wasn’t arkerate, you know.","He did more than this now, for he pulled up short, and tossed up his nose, and accosted with a whinny a horse of more leisure, who was standing by the door.","And I was pleased that he did not in any way attempt to “talk goody,” as our people call it, nor even refer to my lonely condition; though I knew by the softness of his manner that it was present to his mind.","What is it you want me to notice, my boy?” “Why, I want you to notice particularly how Sally behaves to her husband.","He won’t be back this side of Christmas, unless my friend is a liar, and then I shall do you as good a turn as you are going to do me now.","“Shall we rest a minute beneath this willow?” he said, as the sun drew along the stream, and the myriad twinkles of bright air seemed to be dancing to the silver chord of waves; then we slid into the silence of a cool arcade, and I said,— “It is high time for Moggs to have some beer.” Mindful of this prime need of every British waterman, I had brought a little stone jar from my uncle’s tap; and thinking that the savour of this fine beverage might not be agreeable to our fair freight, I landed on the island, with a wink to “the Duke;” and he very kindly followed me.",What good is it to me?,Don’t pop the question without my leave.” What a way to put it!,"Sometimes there arises a strong hot June; but scarcely more than once in twenty summers; and then, before the days come to their turn, leaves are getting flabby, and the grass is over-ripe, and the petals of the wild rose lie in the ditch, and the blossom of the wheat has dropped, its little quivery bee’s-wing.","Tell Kitty that I am waiting for her down the garden.” And so on, until I began to smile, and to fear that I should never have my Kitty to myself.","But Downy came back to the entrance for fresh air, or perhaps to be certain that he was not watched.","I have known many very tranquil Radicals, and one or two Tories of an energetic turn.","“Two windows open, and some rain come in; but no signs of entrance by them.","But I should have thought he was about the last man you could find to risk his hide for mere larkiness.” “Well, I don’t know that he risked very much.","I tried to laugh, but could only stare, and wonder what was coming next.","I think he might have come and paid his respects to Miss Fairthorn, even if he did not think me worthy of that honour."
