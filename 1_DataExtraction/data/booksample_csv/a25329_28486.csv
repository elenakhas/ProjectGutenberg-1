One large section of the pier was vacant.,He's a good host and a really good man to deal with--liberal trader.,"Suddenly, he frowned in annoyance.","The slender creature reared into the air, tooth-studded jaws gaping wide.",You'd have to set two or three of them back on their heels the first day.,"That would be trouble, of course, but of minor nature.",Only some subhuman could bring himself to study such things.,He was feeling better now.,"There were more of the growls and hisses, then the headman waved a hand southward and the other nodded again and turned away, to run into the trees and disappear.","""If this guy needs all that stuff just to get by, he's as near to psionic zero as you can get,"" Naran told himself.","""Didn't mean a thing, I was just making a crack.""",The air in the clearing glowed and a scene formed in the open space.,"Where were your people?""",Barra looked angrily at the man.,"All south forest, near swamp.",He probably had his entire wealth tied up in this one caravan and depended on his fees and on the sale of some few goods of his own to meet expenses.,"Dar Makun nodded again, then turned and waved an arm.","Before some of the huts surrounding the rude plaza, women squatted on the ground, their arms swinging monotonously up and down as they struck their wooden pestles into bowls of grain which they were grinding to make the coarse meal which was their mainstay of diet.",He motioned.,"Of course, he knew that some lacklanders could make vocal converse with the pseudomen and caravan masters seemed to do it as a regular thing, but he could see no point in such effort.",And the village didn't match with the standards he wanted.,There were the carrier beasts.,"""All right.",He was in the central clearing of Tibara.,Was this an investigator from the Council?,"Oh, I've seen the lake region from the hills, of course, but--"" He looked at the water thoughtfully.",The flare of energy had left him incapable of so much as receiving a strongly driven thought for many days.,Kio Barra squirmed in his chair.,He floated out of the building and let himself down on the cushions in the rear of his speedboat.,"""These drivers can get pretty rough with each other.",This was not taking care of the situation.,But that could wait for a few days.,"""Not too many, but I could do with less of them.""","""I know you're scared.","Barra studied the space between boat and logs for an instant, then nodded in satisfaction.",It was a definite strain on his neck muscles to wear the thing and he always got a headache from it.,He had felt no-- He looked at Kio Barra.,"He was a tall, slender man, perfectly at ease in his plain trail clothing.","The old man looked over, then shrugged.","""I never realized what a big lake this is,"" he remarked.","""And get this mess cleaned up.","One could never be too careful, he thought.",This was not the first time he'd had to take a firm hand in Tibara.,"Besides, this matter was the responsibility of the Council of Controllers and the scholars they paid so highly.",And when this barely tolerated being had managed somehow to gain power and get amplifying devices?,He had lost pseudomen slaves in this very null and he knew he would probably lose more.,"Kira Barra was well protected, of that he had made sure.","It was not an unusual request, of course.",Barra watched as the stack of cargo grew.,The Estates had prospered.,There was no point in continuing his masquerade any further.,He had viewed the area personally.,There was no answer to that argument that he could present.,He waited till Dar Makun had finished with his growls and hisses.,"He had been right, he thought.","Certainly, the northern null was no place for him to go.","Unless he was badly mistaken, he knew now where his brother had gone.","Barra blinked, then activated the new probe.",See whether they've wandered during the night.,He smiled as he remembered his fumbling efforts with the first caravan and his halting improvements when he had dealt with the next.,Goods could be disposed of.,"Not idle, is rest day.","""You may have your drivers load up and move to a more permanent location.""","The canopy was down, leaving the lines of the boat clean and sharp.",They were tractable and comfortable to ride.,"Here and there, he noted herdsmen and chore boys either watching or urging the great brutes about with their noisemakers, keeping the herd together.",The caravan master drew his mount to a halt and drifted toward the trees.,This lacklander clown actually dared to try to establish domination over a member of the ruling class?,"At the apex of the vee, he could see the shape of a boat, its bow riding high over the water.","""A good carrier can handle a dozen tons without too much trouble, but some of these things have it tough to handle their own weight on dry land and you have to look 'em over pretty closely to be sure which is which.",Someone had disturbed the pile of building stones.,He looked critically at the huts.,Perhaps he could discern the hidden identification Makun had mentioned.,"""Why don't you face it?","It rose above the foliage, emitting a hissing bellow.","Then, tucking his heavy duty distorter under his arm, he turned toward the outer door.","He had stayed overnight and then taken his departure, saying something about cutting around the null and back to his normal, northern swing.","Grain waved in the breeze and here and there, the silhouettes of both long-neck and fin-back could be seen, half hidden by grass and trees.",Or was he attempting some sort of defiance?,I haven't and I don't.,"Of course, if the Council found out about this, they could deal with the situation.",The herd was all here--even to the chicks.,"Makun looked around, then shrugged."
