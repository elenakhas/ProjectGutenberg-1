 Divine, far-echoing, names once writ in stone  Have vanished in the dust and void of time;  But ye, firm-set, secure,  Like Treasure in the hardness of God's palm,  Are yet the same for ever; ye endure  By virtue of an old slow-ripening word,  In your grey majesty and sovereign calm,  Untouched, unstirred.","The short night passed in wakeful prayer for some,  For others in brief sleep, broken by dreams  And spiritual visitations.","The roar shall vanish at its height,  And over that tremendous town  The silence of eternal night  Shall gather close and settle down.",It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.,"'If any grow disturbed, we bring them gently hither,    To read the world's grim record and the sombre lore  Massed in these pitiless vaults, and they returning thither,    Bear with them quieter thoughts, and make for change no more.'",U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.,"PERSONALITY  O differing human heart,  Why is it that I tremble when thine eyes,  Thy human eyes and beautiful human speech,  Draw me, and stir within my soul  That subtle ineradicable longing  For tender comradeship?","Yea, 'twas hard  To keep the sacred courage in our hearts,  When all was blind with that unchanging night,  And foul with death, and on our ears the taunts  And ribald curses of the soldiery  Fell mingled with the prisoners' cries, a load  Sharper to bear, more bitter than their blows.","Within the palace court the rounds    Of glare and shadow, day and night,  Went ever with the same dull sounds,        The same dull flight:  The motion of slow forms of state,    The far-off murmur of the street,  The din of couriers at the gate,        Half-mad with heat;  Sometimes a distant shout of boys    At play upon the terrace walk,  The shutting of great doors, and noise        Of muttered talk.","Daily we were amazed at her soft strength,  Her pliant and untroubled constancy,  Her smiling, soldierly contempt of death,  Her beauty and the sweetness of her voice.","In all their great fair cities there was neither seeking    For power of gold, nor greed of lust, nor desperate pain  Of multitudes that starve, or, in hoarse anger breaking,    Beat at the doors of princes, break and fall in vain.",Or would you name it by some other name?',"For down the sloping darkness far ahead  She saw a little figure slight and small,  With yearning arms and shadowy curls outspread,  Running at frightened speed;

with the rest  Again Perpetua's father, worn with care;  Nor could we choose but pity his distress,  So miserably, with abject cries and tears,  He fondled her and called her 'Domina,'  And bowed his aged body at her feet,  Beseeching her by all the names she loved  To think of him, his fostering care, his years,  And also of her babe, whose life, he said,  Would fail without her;
