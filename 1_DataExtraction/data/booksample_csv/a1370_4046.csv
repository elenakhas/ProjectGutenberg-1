But all in vain.,"I yielded, in any case, a little to this subtle pressure from the past, and I must have strolled among the lilac and laburnums for a longer time than I knew, since the gardener who had been trimming the flower-beds with a hand lawn-mower was gone, and dusk already veiled the cedars, when I found myself leaning against the wooden gate that opened into the less formal part beyond the larches.","The Beauty that in you was truth, in Marion tenderness, was harvested: and somebody was pleased.","And the results, I may tell you now without pride, since, as we both admit, no credit attaches to myself--the results astonished the entire Colony....","The thrill had worked its magic as of old, but this time in its slower English fashion, deep, and characteristically sure.",And pity then returned.,"Then, suddenly, the shameless night drew on some exquisite veil, as the moon, between three-quarters and the full, slid out of sight behind a streaky cloud.","For it seemed a development of that new perception which first dawned upon me during my brief period of married life, and had since lain hidden in me, potential possibly, but inactive beyond all question, if not wholly dead.","I complete the confession by adding briefly, that after marriage she resented and repelled all my advances.",I have tried to tell you something of this mystery.,"A mysterious power dealt the cards for me with unfailing instinct; a fortunate combination of events placing in my hands, precisely at the moment of their greatest value, clear opportunities that none but a hopeless blunderer could have disregarded.","""Your forgiveness,"" I heard distinctly, ""I need your full forgiveness.""",The change was sudden.,And then it came.,"I visited the very field, the very poplar ...","""I would hear music,"" she whispered, ""before I go again.""","II THE brief marriage ran its course, depleting rather than enriching me, and I know you realized before the hurried, dreadful end that my tie with yourself was strengthened rather than endangered, and that I took from you nothing that I might give it to her.","I was to be that thing we used to laugh about together in your Cambridge days, a distinguished personality; I should belong to the breed of little lions.","Will you be patient now, if I give you a crude instance of what I mean?","But more--it could be shared with others; it was become a portion of myself, and that which is part of my being must, inevitably and automatically, be given out.","""You shall have it,"" I said gently, ""and very soon.","It is, for me, a definite assurance and belief, because--I know.","The slowness, the absence of colour, imagination, rhythm, baffled me, while the ugliness of common things and common usages afflicted my new sensitiveness.","The emptiness and then the satisfaction, as first and last conditions, never failed, and that they took place in my heart rather than in my mind I can affirm with equal certainty.","The wind on the Downs, your favourite Downs, your favourite southwest wind, received your dust, scattering it like pollen into space.","That which was gross in me, leaping like fire to claim her glorious beauty, met and merged with that similar, devouring flame in her; but in the merging seemed cunningly transformed into the call of soul to soul: I forgot the pity....","I feasted my eyes and ears, the blood rose feverishly to my head.","Mother, as you know, met me at the station, for they had stopped the down-train by special orders, so that I stepped out upon the deserted platform of the countryside quite alone, a distinguished man, with my rug and umbrella.","For coming unexpectedly, as it did, in this familiar scene where yet previously I had never known it, it had the effect of marking the change in me with a certainty from which there was no withdrawal possible.",Yet each time I read the cunning article (I have less hair than when I ran away from Sandhurst that exciting July night and met you in the Strand!,"The ancient inns, for instance, adapted to week-end motor traffic, were pretentious and uncomfortable, their ""menus"" of inferior food written elaborately in French.",The habits and the outlook stood precisely where I had left them.,"I have forgotten names.""","I was first visible, then concealed.",It is unexpected.,"It was the singing of this sweet English bird, making articulate for me the beauty I could not utter, that brought back to memory the scene, the music, and the words....","""I've got a headache and thought I might soothe it with a little music.",It taught me a new beauty that even my finest dreams had left unmentioned.,"I remember trying to think; I wanted to relieve the singular tension by finding words, if only inner words,--when, out of the stillness, out of the silence, out of the shadows--something happened.",It came suddenly.,"The courtliness had vanished, and the cost had come.","Now, I have treated you in this letter as though you were a woman who reads a novel, for in my first pages I have let you turn to the end and see that the climax is a happy one, lest you should faint by the way and close my story with a yawn.",The inspiration operated like a flash.,"And as I spoke her name and rose, she also spoke my own, my Christian name, and rose as well.","And on my way home, resentful perhaps yet eager still, I did a dreadful thing.","The legend that twins may share a single soul has always seemed to me grotesque and unpoetic nonsense, a cruel and unnecessary notion too: a man is sufficiently imperfect without suffering this further subtraction from his potentialities.","This exaltation passed, of course, with the passing of the thrill that made it possible; it was truly instantaneous; a point of ecstasy, perhaps, in some category not of time at all, but of some state of consciousness that lifted me above, outside of, self.","It seemed contrary to precedent, advice, against experience too, yet it was the right, the only way.","Yet sound there was, a moment later.","""Listen, mother,"" I said, turning towards her.",The walls give back their laughter; all day long     They fill the house with song.,"The lamplight showed one shoulder, one arm, one ear, the rest concealed; but the way he drove was, of course, unmistakeable; slowly, more cautiously, perhaps, but with the same flourish of the whip, the same air of untold responsibility as ever.","My trade as a soldier has led me to an administrative post in a distant land where, apparently, I have deserved well of my King and Country, as they say in the obituaries.","Thus, deftly, having touched a chord of pity in me, she began to play; her voice followed; dinner and dressing, the house-party and my mother's guests, were all forgotten.","And silence followed, so deep that I could hear the murmur of my blood...  an exquisite joy ran through me, making me quiver with expectancy from head to foot.... And it was then suddenly I became aware that the long-closed door at last was open, the still chamber occupied.",I found again the conditions of innocence and pristine wonder--of simplicity.,"That ""recovery"" of consciousness I feel bound to question, as you shall shortly hear.","Natural, simple things, as before, were the channel through which beauty appealed to that latent store of love and wisdom in me which, it almost seemed, were being slowly educated.",The glamour of association did not operate.,"Culture and knowledge we may fairly claim, no doubt, but the imaginative sense of beauty is o rare among us that its possession is a peculiarity good form would suppress.","You will see, therefore, that there was no desire in me to revive an unhappy memory, least of all to establish any fancied communication with one before whose generous love I had felt myself dishonoured, if not actually disgraced.",She had asked if I was hungry.... And then the smells!,"The Thrill stole forth and touched me, passing like a meteor through my heart, but in that lightning passage, cleaving it open to some wisdom that seemed most near to love.","Let me be frank--I sought it, even longing for it when there was no decision to be made, no guidance therefore needed: I longed for it because of the great sweetness that it left within my heart.",She seemed so tiny now.,"The sweet, faint garden smell in the English twilight:--of laurels and laurestinus, of lilac, pinks, and the heavy scent of May, wall-flowers and sweet william too--these, with the poignant aroma of the old childhood house, were the background of familiar loveliness against which my subsequent disillusion of the homeland set itself in such afflicting contrast.",I heard the wind in the poplar overhead.,The Manor House was very still when I arrived from London--& late May evening between the sunset and the dark.,"As I wrote above, I saw my own insignificance, yet, such was the splendour in me, I knew my right as well.","I loved the source of my guidance and assistance, though I dared attach no name to it.","I smelt the pungent perfume of dry heather, sand, and bracken.","Fairly clean-minded, I hope I may be, but beyond all question I am the male animal incarnate.","""You call me Marion,"" she went on in an eager tone that surely belied her pain and weakness, ""but I do not remember that.",I paused and stared.,"They stood outlined very tenderly against the sky; their slender forms still quivered; their feathery hair fell earthwards as they drew themselves together, bending their wayward little heads before the approaching night.","I think she knew with shame that she had caught me with her lowest weapon, yet still hoped that the highest in her might complete and elevate her victory.","It broke up through some repressive layer that had apparently concealed it, and made me feel--well, had I been thirty-five years younger, I could have cried--for pleasure.","How, why, and wherefore--I catch your crowd of questions in advance--we need not seek exactly to discover, although the answer of no uncertain kind, I hear within the stillness of a heart that has learned to beat to a deeper, sweeter rhythm than before.",I would shake free and follow beauty.,"All well at home, I hope?""",I can only answer: By some one who is pleased; and probably by many such.,"Its evidence lies strewn so thick, so prodigally, about our world, that not one among us, whatever his surroundings and conditions, but sooner or later must encounter at least one marvellous instance of its uplifting presence.","And in this emotion, in its quality and character, hid remotely a personal suggestion: each time it offered itself, that is, I was aware of a sharp quiver of sensitive life within me, and of that sensation, extraordinarily sweet and wonderful, which constitutes a genuine thrill."
