"There was a tale that once an Indian, whom the weaver had made an enemy, had come there in the night seeking to kill the white man who was so bold as to dwell by himself.","Goody Parsons drew back, but there was no need, the line of their flight was straight toward the stooping shoemaker.","Famine and pestilence might be checked, but the fire of heresy, once lit among them, might burn until the peace of the whole Colony was destroyed.","The music of the drum and the high, thin fife playing Yankee Doodle died in the distance and there was left only the sound of thudding feet, scuffling in a choking cloud of dust.",There was a ship just sailing from Boston whose captain was my father’s friend and a kindly man.,"That he was old, Margeret had known from the talk in the field, but she had not been prepared to see any one so feeble, so small and shrunken, so bowed down with age and long hardship.",For Stephen was thoroughly resolved that resistance should be made.,"She was speaking in a clear, steady voice that carried to the ears of all the waiting people.","Little by little, they learned the story of how the house and garden had been destroyed.","In little groups, by twos and threes, the village men and their children followed, talking excitedly as they went.","Besides, great oaf that I was, I began to feel that my unaided wit was a match for the whole British Army.” Stephen chuckled and then laughed aloud.","It chanced that the one just put into place was the best and most elaborate of all, for it had a pane of glass in its side through which one could see the newcomers already turning to the work that would result in the building up of a golden honeycomb.","Alisoun could not mistake that tall bow and broad, heavy stern.","“I would have asked your consent first,” he replied gravely, “for in the eyes of the law such a crime would be shared by all who were in the house that admitted him.",For one thing only I can be thankful; it is that misgiving checked my foolish tongue in time and I did not tell of this boy’s share in bringing me here.,"She could still remember the look on his face as the crowd went surging by them and how he had turned upon his heel muttering, “How long, O Lord, how long?” “How can they do it?” she had gasped, as she, too, turned from the terrifying sight.","“It is surely a pleasant world,” said Gerald, as he drank in long breaths of the fresh warm air and looked out at the dancing blue waters of the harbour.","The round window on the landing encircled, like a frame, a far view of rocky capes, scattered islands and broad, blue sea.","I do not know what to think, yet I cannot put the tale out of my mind.","This sounded, surely, more like ordinary common sense than like witchcraft.","To his house more than to any other she had gone, during the years of want, and had given help when otherwise starvation would have come very close.","Wheat and barley and rye now grew where once a smooth strip of greensward had extended down to the harbour’s edge, while the sturdy women and growing boys of Hopewell were taught to turn their bits of land to similar account.","The young officer who led them seemed sorely angered at what the Hessians had done; I heard him say hotly to his superior in command, “‘Such wanton destruction is a sin and a shame, sir.’ “I verily believe he would have set his own men to putting out the fire had they not been commanded to go forward at once.","“Away with the man who would have us shed innocent blood.” Master Cotton Mather was a brave man and one always firmly, nay, stubbornly loyal to his cause.","That stout soldier, after laying forth his plan to march through Hopewell and the next village and make a stand on North Hill, a spot so favourable that they could be certain of holding fast until help arrived, firmly maintained that he would not stir one step without Master Sheffield and neither would his men.","You will get nothing from her by gentleness.” Through the door, that had been left open, came a low, whining voice speaking in rapid French, and round the edge of the doorpost peered the dark face of the half-breed pedlar.","Did you think to keep all this from your poor old father, who should stop at home now that age has bowed him down?",“But this is a strange world!,"“There are travellers from Salem riding into the inn yard,” she heard some one call.","“How happily we used to play together when we two were little eager lads and he was a big, kindly one.","Friends who had grieved much over his never having married, felt now that they need be concerned no more, since Clotilde was as devoted to him and he to her as though she had been a child of his own.",That she was becoming also a great comfort to Stephen Sheffield was very plain to all who knew them.,"“I was thinking,” he answered slowly, “that I should like to have lived in such stirring times and to have seen such adventures.",The horn lantern in his hand winked and flickered but managed somehow to remain feebly alight as they struggled on against the storm.,"You shall act in the matter only as you choose.” Margeret went into the house, taking Amos with her, and left Alisoun to make her decision alone.","Who knows, it maybe in waiting for you only just around the corner of the next year.” The sun stood high overhead as they went up the path together, while through the drone of the bees and the subdued twitter of the birds in the drowsy noonday, Margeret could hear the whirr of her mother’s busy wheel.","For a month the two were to live out their honeymoon in the little house a stone’s throw from Master Simon’s door, and after that Margeret was to hide with her father or he with her, while Roger went to sea again.","What your future will be, I may not know, for presently I will go back to England and we may never meet again.",So do you keep it and if it saves you from tumbling out of any more treetops I shall be satisfied.” Captain Amos’ visit was all too short.,"“I verily believe that Stephen Sheffield would melt the head off his cane if he thought it would help,” he chuckled as he unlocked his money box.",“It was because I was weary of working so much and being so dull and sober.,That was the question on everybody’s tongue.,"It must have been that he likened it in his mind to the rising tide of the cause of Liberty, coming so slowly but not to be stopped or stayed by the hand of any man.","He stumbled out, closing the door behind him, and left Clotilde alone to a silence broken only by the crackling of the fire, the whirring of the shuttle and the creaking of the loom.","He is mad for gain these latter days, and he must have a fortune stored away in his hiding-hole behind the cupboard.” On the Sabbath day that Margeret was eighteen, she was still thinking, as she sat in the meeting-house, of the peril that had hung over them so long.","There is no power on earth can stop me now.” “And is there not?” cried out Goody, shrilly.","Was he really going, and the shadow of his ill-will to be taken from her life for all time?",On this wild night the expedition had a good chance of skirting Hopewell unnoticed and accomplishing its errand undisturbed.,"Goody Parsons chuckled as she saw him go, but it was with shaking hands that she closed the hive.","Guests were coming later among whom there would be much weighty discussion of urgent affairs, but now, for a little, there was rest and stillness.","And here, too, is a part of Goody Parsons’ hawthorn bush that I think must also have come from Master Simon.” Poor old Goody Parsons, dead so many years and gone to that Heaven that was to be like Hertfordshire, how she would have rejoiced to know that her memory still lived and had offered back the gift that Master Simon had given.","“Have you no regard for your life?” “I have,” replied Stephen quietly, “but I have a greater regard for the people’s money that has been entrusted to my care.","Here in the New England, where we are planting our fields and gardens with all of what we loved best in the Old, we are planting too, as I can see, something more than gardens, the seeds of a new country and a new life.","Did not his father, Robin Radpath, die in the effort to bear the great Queen’s message to the Emperor of Cathay?","Two other pleasant things had also happened on that same morning, previous to Miles’ coming.","I verily believe that they would burn down your house, should you do such a deed.” “Cease your old woman’s chatter,” he ordered sharply.",“She looked as would any old woman who was frightened and in trouble.,"For the proper completing of Stephen Sheffield’s house, Gerald had used a large part of the little fortune he had brought with him from England, realised from the sale of his small estate.","Those to whom Stephen had done good, and these were a countless legion, could give him nothing in return in the way of money or high office, for such rewards he did not want.","I wonder what she carries!” He could not have wondered so much as did the little maiden who stood on the other side of the hedge, her heart beating as though it would choke her.","No, I felt that I must speak to my comrades once more, and that this was a fitting time.","Some of his pupils were apt and some were not, while five-year-old Peter from across the way was always singing loudly the wrong words and trailing behind when he should have been marching ahead.",People began to shake their heads in doubt.,"Their soft light fell like a benediction upon the strange scene, on the priest’s white hair, on the dark faces of the Indians, on the wet shining leaves of the sheltering hedge.",Finally the last one slipped away; there remained behind only a boy who was putting out the candles and removing the flowers; the service was over.,"Then, seeing the boy’s face clouded with disappointment, he added, “Suppose I come in a day or two and carry you down yonder to the harbour’s edge, where you can sit all day on the warm sand and watch the full blue tide come in.” “Ah, that will be famous,” exclaimed Stephen, “and then perhaps the day after that I can run in the garden again.","“Tell me,” he cried to Branderby, “she does not know?","Such a person as Master Simon, who dared to stand against narrow public opinion when he knew himself to be right, who taught his children and his grandchildren to do the same, did he run so little risk of bringing danger upon himself and upon that which he left behind him?","“I will take the poor creature into my service,” he said, “there is need of another helper in the kitchen and there seems naught else to do with her.",He has brought up again the words of that mad Scotch minister who said that your father was a wicked man and that his garden would be laid waste for his sins.,"Only a tall stone chimney, standing upright in the midst of a heap of smoking embers, showed where the great white house had stood.","“The old age of a garden is fairer and lustier than its youth, and it comes to its greatest glory when tended by the children’s children of the man who planted it.” Since Master Simon’s fields must be tilled by other hands now, and their living therefore had grown less abundant, Margeret had become mistress at the little school, built beyond the meeting-house at the end of a winding lane.","It was, therefore, to mend these difficult matters that Stephen Sheffield was begged to go to England.","Through her kitchen window, she had seen the little shoemaker’s bent figure go up the path, his shoulders bowed by the burden upon his back.",Stand up and make Peter come into the row.,The children came laughing and romping down the schoolhouse lane with many a tribute of flowers and red apples for the teacher they loved.,"When Margeret and Roger returned an hour later, the old woman was sitting quietly by the kitchen fireplace, rubbing the pewter bowl until it shone in the candle light.","Cynthia had wished to make more certain of the heart of Hugh Atherton, the lad who was studying at Harvard College to be a minister, while Alisoun wished to assure the safe return of the young ship’s captain, Gilbert Sheffield, from his long voyage to the West Indies.",But Stephen’s hands did not move.,"It must be your quick wit and courage that can avail to save us all in such a case.” The priest spoke very little after they had gone, and finally dropped into a doze in the big chair.",“You shall not shoot!” she called out loudly as she grasped him by the dripping sleeve of his red coat.,But even he could see when such a cause had perished utterly and when it were better to pursue his object in some more hopeful place.,It will not be long before they and our brave General will force you and your like to flee beyond our borders.
