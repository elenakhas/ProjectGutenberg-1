"""You will come to attention and deliver your report.",Of course it didn't.,"And so were ours, once he told us what he'd seen.",*       *       *       *       * Tom grinned a little sympathetically.,Monroe and I started work on building the dome.,I rapped out.,"This had been regarded as a probable waste of time, rocket fuel and manpower--but a necessary precaution.","""It's a little bigger than ours, and it's a little flatter on top.","Basically, however, Tom's survey was intended to supply extra geological and astronomical meat for the report which Monroe was to carry back to Army HQ on Earth.","If he's captured, remembering that the first purpose of a scout is acquiring and transmitting knowledge of the enemy, he will snap his suit radio on full volume and pass on as much data as time and the enemy's reflexes permit.",I grunted.,"""I was afraid you'd ask that,"" I told him.","[Illustration] And then, abruptly, I heard Monroe yell my name and there was a terrific clattering in my headphones.","The leader of a top-secret expedition like this--Project Hush they call us, huh, Ben--finds another dome on the Moon.","Waiting to be wiped out, in a blast from some unimaginable weapon.",Any bit of information about them is important.,"Under the circumstances, I think it's the least he could do.""",There isn't too much choice.,He pretended puzzlement.,"Honestly, I felt my neck swelling up inside my helmet.","Now!""",They know we are here--either from watching us land a couple of hours ago or from observing Tom's scout-ship--or they do not know we are here.,"Scientists are people--they wish for recognition, too.","I noticed he was calling me by my rank for the first time since the trip started, which meant he was saying in effect, ""Man, have you got a decision to make!""",The schedule called for him to make a rough three-hour scouting survey in an ever-widening spiral from our dome.,"About what to do, I mean.","Nine years, and all that careful secrecy, all that expenditure of money and mind-cracking research--and it had come to this.","There's a brand-new tiny crater near the dome--the kind usually left by a rocket exhaust.""",Our goal was not just to reach the Moon.,"He just said, ""Poor Monroe.""",The other dome--you want to know who's in it.,I alerted Tom and told him to listen carefully.,"The lock opened and, from where I stood in the open door of our dome, I saw Monroe come out and walk toward me.","And I, Colonel Benjamin Rice, first commanding officer of Army Base No.","""Lots of luck.""","""Couldn't be just a regularly shaped bump in the ground, could it?""","""I'm a geologist, Monroe.",An unmanned rocket would be useless against the new weapons.,"Major Monroe Gridley prepared the big rocket, with its tiny cubicle of living space, for the return journey to Earth which he alone would make.","I was hoping the whole expedition would be written up in the history books, but it looked unpromising.",Nobody even knew we had raised ship.,I asked worriedly.,"1 on the Moon, dragged crate after enormous crate out of the ship on my aching academic back, and piled them in the spot two hundred feet away where the plastic dome would be built.","But we felt pretty sure, before we took off, that we had plugged every possible leak.",Project Hush were so concerned about security.,"I promised to do my best, of course.","How does that sound to you?""","Meanwhile, we proceed with extreme caution, so as not to precipitate an interplanetary war with potentially friendly Martians, or whatever they are.","After capturing Monroe, whatever's in that other dome will come looking for us, I think.","""How's every little thing?""","His round face, inside its transparent bubble helmet, was fish-belly white.",You can't tell from the crater what kind of propulsive device these characters are using.,"It was a simple pre-fab affair, but big enough to require an awful lot of assembling.",It's vitally important that Army Headquarters be informed of this immediately.,He was supposed to watch for such things as bug-eyed monsters out for a stroll on the Lunar landscape.,I had a good idea of what his expression was like.,"But that's all there is to see.""","They are either humans from Earth--in which case they are in all probability enemy nationals--or they are alien creatures from another planet--in which case they may be friends, enemies or what-have-you.","""Therefore, I suggest that I sit in the dome on one end of a telephone hookup with Tom, who will sit in the ship, his hand over the firing button, ready to blast off for Earth the moment he gets the order from me.",But I'd have hated myself just as much for picking Tom.,I'll shout it up to you and you'll still be able to take off in plenty of time.,"He will then proceed the rest of the way on foot, doing the best scouting job he can in a spacesuit.",Lieutenant-colonel Thomas Hawthorne painstakingly examined our provisions and portable quarters for any damage that might have been incurred in landing.,He pushed his way past me and sat down on a box to one side of the dome.,So we went into our ship and had a council of war.,"""Only trouble, Colonel,"" Monroe said slowly as he rose, ""is that I'm one-_fourth_ Indian and even that....","Monroe will take the single-seater down to the Riphaen Mountains, landing as close to the other dome as he thinks safe.","Unfortunately, it was put out of commission by a rock slide.",Tom was back in forty minutes.,"""Why did you pick Monroe for the scout?""","All right?""","""Hey, Tom,"" Monroe put in.","In that case, their side winds up in possession of important information concerning our personnel and equipment, while our side has only the bare knowledge that somebody or something else has a base on the Moon.","""How are you, Ben?""","There was no oxygen system in the dome yet, so I had to squeeze up a sandwich from the food compartment in my suit.","I didn't dare use the telephone to chat with Tom in the ship, for fear I might miss an important word or phrase from our scout.",I think common sense and standard military procedure demand that we consider them hostile until we have evidence to the contrary.,"Meanwhile, Tom Hawthorne took his plump self off in the single-seater rocket which, up to then, had doubled as a lifeboat.","And if anything happened and I had to tell Tom to blast off, I'd probably be sitting here in the dome all by myself after that, waiting.... ""_Broz neggle!_"" came over the radio in Monroe's resonant voice.",I seized on that.,But I was sitting under two inches of sweat.,"""We're three extremely unathletic Ph.D.s who have been in the Army since we finished our schooling.","*       *       *       *       * Two hours later, the scout ship landed near the dome."
