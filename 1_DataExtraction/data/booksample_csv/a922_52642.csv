so … and then the fear of death came … I was utterly confounded!","‘You are now a free man,’ she said, ‘and ought to feel more at ease.’ ‘More at ease, to be sure, madam,’ answered Martin Petrovitch, by no means, however, showing in the expression of his face that he really was more at ease.","There’s a great soul in this woman, believe me.… From Venice the conversation passed to Italy, to the Italians.",The discipline among her peasants is a perfect model.… The education of her children is model!,"What accomplished hypocrites they are, though, I thought.",I was at no great pains to surmise that my late arrival did not count for much in it.,She completely subsided.,"Suddenly without turning towards me, she softly whispered--‘Please don’t do that again!’ and instantly began telling me about something else.… I was very much ashamed.",have you brought him?’ asked my mother.,"Can death spare any one whatever in this world?’ ‘What have you got in your head, my good friend?","During the discussions between the landowners, Anna Martinovna’s attitude was composed and dignified, she showed no sign of being specially obstinate, nor specially grasping.",Tell me what I ought to do.,You see she knew and knows a lot that she oughtn’t to have known at her age.… But was it her fault?,"If it had not been for Priemkov walking behind us, and the little girl skipping about in front of us, I could really have fancied I was three-and-twenty, instead of thirty-five;

to-day I am going to surprise you more.","That’s why she cried the other day when she declared she would never love any one but me.--She imagines you despise her, that you most likely know about her birth;
