"if you indeed exist, you see what I suffer.","In his subtle capacity for enjoying the more refined points of earth, of human relationship, he could throw the gleam of poetry or humour on what seemed common or threadbare; has a care for the [120] sighs, and the weary, humdrum preoccupations of very weak people, down to their little pathetic ""gentilities,"" even; while, in the purely human temper, he can write of death, almost like Shakespeare.","And though the Urn-Burial certainly has much of the character of a poem, yet one is never allowed to forget that it was designed, candidly, as a scientific treatise on one department of ancient ""culture"" (as much so as Guichard's curious old French book on Divers Manners of Burial) and was the fruit of much labour, in the way especially of industrious selection from remote and difficult writers; there being then few or no handbooks, or anything like our modern shortcuts to varied knowledge.","The swift, vindictive anger leaps, like a white flame, into this white spirit, and, stripped in a moment of all convention, she stands before us clear, detached, columnar, among the tender frailties of the piece.","Still, there is some truth in the statement, and more than people think, especially as regards our own day.","In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.","Besides wide book-learning, experimental research at home, and indefatigable observation in the open air, he prosecutes the ordinary duties of a physician; contrasting himself indeed with other students, ""whose quiet and unmolested doors afford no such distractions.""","""I was driven from life in motion to life in thought and sensation:"" so Coleridge sums up his childhood, with its delicacy, its sensitiveness, and passion.","Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project Gutenberg-tm License.","At the Restoration he rejoices to see the return of the comely Anglican order in old episcopal Norwich, with its ancient churches; the antiquity, in particular, of the English Church being, characteristically, one of the things he most valued in it, vindicating it, when occasion came, against the ""unjust scandal"" of those who made that Church a creation of Henry the Eighth.","The spiritual body had anticipated the formal moment of death; the alert soul, in that tardy decay, changing its vesture gradually, and as if piece by piece.",The philosophical conception of the relative has been developed in modern times through the influence of the sciences of observation.,"And in truth, but for that adventitious poetic gold, it would be only ""plume-plucked Richard.""","because she believed, poor little soul!","But never either found another   To free the hollow heart from paining--   They stood aloof the scars remaining,   Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;

Scene II.,"""Yes!",She cast on me a terrible look and drank.,"Monseigneur de Courteheuse would seem to be little over fifty years of age: he is rather tall, and very thin: the eyes, black and full of life, are encircled by a ring of deep brown.","since there is, under the conditions supposed, for those elements of the man, for every lineament of the vision within, the one word, the one acceptable word, recognisable by the sensitive, by others ""who have intelligence"" in the matter, as absolutely as ever anything can be in the evanescent and delicate region of human language.","Such gift of appreciation depends, as I said, on the habitual apprehension of men's life as a whole--its organic wholeness, as extending even to the least things in it--of its outward manner in connexion with its inward temper; and it involves a fine perception of the congruities, the musical accordance between humanity and its environment of custom, society, personal intercourse; as if all this, with its meetings, partings, ceremonies, gesture, tones of speech, were some delicate instrument on which an expert performer is playing.",He holds that there has never existed an atheist.,"The shadowy world, which he realises so powerfully, has still the ways and houses, the land and water, the light and darkness, the fire and flowers, that had so much to do in the moulding of those bodily powers and aspects which counted for so large a part of the soul, here.","True, on the whole, to fact, it is another side of kingship which he has made prominent in his English histories.","Such modes or fashions are, at their best, an example of the artistic predominance of form over matter; of the manner of the doing of it over the thing done; and have a beauty of their own.","Rather than believe that, I would accept death at his hands a hundred times over!'","Skirting the borders of this world of bewildering heights and depths, he got but the first exciting influence of it, that joyful enthusiasm which great imaginative theories prompt, when the mind first comes to have an understanding of them; and it is not under the influence of these thoughts that his poetry becomes tedious or loses its blitheness.",202.,"As happens with sensitive natures, it attunes him to a congruous suavity of manners, by which anger itself became flattering: [195] it blends with his merely youthful hopefulness and high spirits, his sympathetic love for gay people, things, apparel--""his cote of gold and stone, valued at thirty thousand marks,"" the novel Italian fashions he preferred, as also with those real amiabilities that made people forget the darker touches of his character, but never tire of the pathetic rehearsal of his fall, the meekness of which would have seemed merely abject in a less graceful performer.",Bernard proposes to take the child away with him to Paris.,"And as happens with children he attains contentment finally in the merely passive recognition of superior strength, in the naturalness of the result of the great battle as a matter of course, and experiences something of the royal prerogative of poetry to obscure, or at least to attune and soften men's griefs.","Deeply saddened by the conditions of the present time, he habituated himself to find a refuge in the past, and the seventeenth century more particularly offered him the kind of society in which he would have wished to live--a society, well-ordered, polished, lettered, believing.","And she will never, never know that it was not so; that I am innocent; that the thought is torment to me: that I am the most unhappy of men.","'Tis very pregnant:   The jewel that we find we stoop and take it,   Because we see it; but what we do not see   We tread upon, and never think of it.","Of this new sense, the writings of Wordsworth are the central and elementary expression: he is more simply and entirely occupied with it than any other poet, though there are fine expressions of precisely the same thing in so different a poet as Shelley.","That volume bears witness to the reverse of any failure of power, or falling-off from his early standard of literary perfection, in every one of his then accustomed forms of poetry--the song, the sonnet, and the ballad.","Fancies of the strange things which may very well happen, even in broad daylight, to men shut up alone in ships far off on the sea, seem to have occurred to the human mind in all ages with a peculiar readiness, and often have about them, from the story of the stealing of Dionysus downwards, the fascination of a certain dreamy grace, which distinguishes them from other kinds of marvellous inventions.","It was but dim, and the sky not clear....","The illness, the operation (skilfully performed by the old doctor) which restores her to life, are described with that seemingly simple pathos in which M.

the wretched punctuation of the piece being not the only cause of its impressing the reader with the notion that he is but dealing with a collection of notes for a more finished composition, and of a different kind; perhaps a purely erudite treatise on its subject, with detachment of all personal colour now adhering [156] to it.","And then, how pleasantly, how reassuringly, the whole nightmare story itself is made to end, among the clear fresh sounds and lights of the bay, where it began, with   The moon-light steeped in silentness,   The steady weather-cock.","In common we indulged our enthusiasm for those days of faith; of the quiet life; its blissful hours of leisure well-secured; for the French language in its beauty and purity; the delicate, the noble urbanity, which was then the honour and the special mark of our country, but has ceased to be so.""","His suspicion, in the abstract, of what Bacon calls Idola Fori, the Idols of the Market-place, takes a special emphasis from the course of events about him: ""being erroneous in their single numbers, once huddled together, they will be error itself.""","She was [108] released on the brother's pledging himself to watch over her; and to this sister, from the age of twenty-one, Charles Lamb sacrificed himself, ""seeking thenceforth,"" says his earliest biographer, ""no connexion which could interfere with her supremacy in his affections, or impair his ability to sustain and comfort her.""","Are we in the Inferno?--we are tempted to ask, wondering at something malign in so much beauty.","I am not one of those for whom God, when He disappears, [228] leaves no sense of a void place.","Where like a man beloved of God,   Through glooms which never woodman trod,   How oft, pursuing fancies holy, [94]   My moonlight way o'er flowering weeds I wound,   Inspired, beyond the guess of folly,   By each rude shape and wild unconquerable sound!","He fancies he can trace, through all the simpler forms of life, fragments of an eloquent prophecy about the [78] human mind.",Those sciences reveal types of life evanescing into each other by inexpressible refinements of change.,The most powerful expressions of this side of experience might be found here.,"There are, thus, the born romanticists and the born classicists.","Between these groups, on a smaller scale, come the slighter and more homely episodes, with Sir Nathaniel the curate, the country-maid Jaquenetta, Moth or Mote the elfin-page, with Hiems and Ver, who recite ""the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the owl and the cuckoo.""","Fragmentary and obscure, but often eloquent, and always at once earnest and ingenious, those writings, supplementing his remarkable gift of conversation, were directly and indirectly influential, even on some the furthest removed from Coleridge's own masters; on John Stuart Mill, for instance, and some of the earlier writers of the ""high-church"" school.","To this more high-pitched feeling, since predominant in our literature, the writings of Charles Lamb, whose life occupies the last quarter of the eighteenth century and the first quarter of the nineteenth, are a transition; and such union of grave, of terrible even, with gay, we may note in the circumstances of his life, as reflected thence into his work.","What special sense does Wordsworth exercise, and what instincts does he satisfy?","Yet we almost seem to hear Bacon when Browne discourses on the ""use of doubts, and the advantages which might be derived from drawing up a calendar of doubts, falsehoods, and popular errors;"" and, as from Bacon, one gets the impression that men really have been very much the prisoners of their own crude or pedantic terms, notions, associations; that they have been very indolent in testing very simple matters--with a wonderful kind of ""supinity,"" as he calls it.",The writings of Charles Lamb are an excellent illustration of the value of reserve in literature.,The cold-blooded method of observation and experiment was creeping but slowly over the domain of science; and such unreclaimed portions of it as the phenomena of magnetism had an immense fascination for men like Browne and Digby.,"Liberty, after all his hopes of young France, is only to be found in nature:--   Thou speedest on thy subtle pinions,   The guide of homeless winds, and playmate of the waves!","We live in a world, hard, savage, full of hatred; whose one cruel law is the struggle for existence, and in which we are no more than those natural elements, let loose to war with each other in fierce selfishness, without pity, with no appeal beyond, no hope of final justice.",Indirectly it has suggested two of the most perfect compositions among the poetry of our own generation.,"He is an old-fashioned letter-writer, the essence of the old fashion of letter-writing lying, as with true essay-writing, in the dexterous availing oneself of accident and circumstance, in the prosecution of deeper lines of observation; although, just as with the record of his conversation, one loses something, in losing the actual tones of the stammerer, still graceful in his halting, as he halted also in composition, composing slowly and by fits, ""like a Flemish painter,"" as he tells us, so ""it is to be regretted,"" says the editor of his letters, ""that in the printed letters the reader will lose the curious varieties of writing with which the originals abound, and which are scrupulously adapted to the subject.""","what philosophy of life, what sort of equity?",They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.,Upon what a grand note he can begin and end [155] chapter or paragraph!,"And the difference of mood expressed in that question and its answer, is indicative of a change of temper in regard to the supernatural which has passed over the whole modern mind, and of which the true measure is the influence of the writings of Swedenborg.","Coleridge's prose writings on philosophy, politics, religion, and criticism, were, in truth, but one element in a whole lifetime of endeavours to present the then recent metaphysics of Germany to English readers, as a legitimate expansion of the older, classical and native masters of what has been variously called the a priori, or absolute, or spiritual, or Platonic, view of things."
