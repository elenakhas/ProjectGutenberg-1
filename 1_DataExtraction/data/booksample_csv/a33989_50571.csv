All was up.,If his calculations were correct the yacht should be directly east of Estorya two hundred miles.,"The Duke's two boys cried out to him to cut the so-and-so's throat, but if he was killed instead, they would avenge him when they grew up, if not sooner.",You do so by brushing your hand across this screen.,"Green ran into the cloud, got down on all fours, scuttled through the doorway, cursed desperately when the hilt of his sword caught on the doorframe, tore loose and lunged through into the dense smoke that filled the anteroom.",Be quiet.,"We're using this for just one purpose, rescuing the Earthman and your mother and sisters.","""This island is built much like the first one we encountered.","""Mennirox is an ungrateful god,"" muttered Miran.",And at that moment some savages who'd been running ahead of the torch-bearers burst out of the woods.,He had time to think that perhaps he liked this because of the torture the Duke had inflicted on his many helpless victims.,The skin seemed to have been torn off the palms of his hands.,"To Green, high up on the topmost spar of the foremast, the turning about seemed an awful and unnatural deed.","He stopped for a moment, listened to make sure nobody was in the next room, then pushed on a boss set in a pattern of bronze protuberances, which was connected with the mechanism that operated the secret door.","The next he knew, he was flying through the air, torn from his hold, catapulted far away from the 'roller.","And while he was doing that he had to extend a hand to Miran, who wasn't as fast on his feet.","""Tell me the truth.","He remembered the story of Samdroo, the Tailor Who Turned Sailor.","""This may be for nothing, but we can't just sit down and watch.",Fires were being lit for a midnight snack before the bulk of the meat was brought back to wherever their homes were.,Amra and her son blinked.,"Then, knowing that the doorway lay back to his right, he turned and felt along the metal until he came to the opening.",Instead he took the gun away from Miran's limp grip and silently put it away in the locker.,6 All the next day Green was too busy setting up the schedule of the hunting party to have time to be gloomy.,"""True, true.","25 Shortly after dawn the yacht set sail and sped toward Estorya, a hundred miles west.","Though he ordinarily was against shooting animals just for the fun of it, he had no compunction about putting a ball through these wolfish-looking creatures.","But he'd cram a highly nervous lifetime into those minutes, wondering if perhaps there wouldn't be some unforeseen frustration of Amra's schedule.","""I bow to your superior experience,"" Green said.","It's fluffy, like a young chick's feathers.",Her roots were in an entirely different culture.,The first thing to do was to find a weapon.,"""Up you go!""",And I couldn't face the moment of your departure!,"And if what he had been told was true, beneath the vegetation was one mass of inextricably tangled roots that held the soil together.",His enemies were waiting for him to reveal himself through noise.,One of them was a great eye that allowed Samdroo to see in it what was happening outside the cave.,The savages sooner or later would come to the sanctuary to ask if she'd seen any of the refugees.,Unfortunately it was too dark for the men to have worked swiftly in trimming the sails even if a full crew had been aloft.,"Grinning, the boy ran off.","Green knew that it was hopeless to try to dig through that wall, even if it would be safe for days.",He had crossed out the foreign names and put in names in the Kilkrzan alphabet.,"The city proper, however, is built on three roaming islands that were captured by their magic many centuries ago.""",He turned around and in a short time was back at the cove.,Green didn't answer.,Suddenly Amra spoke.,"It can't possibly compete with us.""",Green's skin prickled at the vindictiveness in her voice and at the vision of what she was probably planning for him.,"""I heard a sailor, Zoob, remark on that very thing just the other day.","Though, I don't know, there may be more.","""Devils?","Silently, he walked into the long single room with its high ceiling.","If he couldn't see an arm's length away, neither could the other two.","The sailor waited, one hand on a rope to steady himself, the other with its dagger held point-out at Green.",You're the candidate.,If the _Bird_ was wrecked it could be abandoned and all the crew could scoot off in the little rollers.,Now he had better try to find some way to pacify him.,He left the death chamber and went into the next room.,"""Do you suppose you could tag along behind your mother and carry Paxi for her?","Green said, watching him closely.","Green gritted his teeth and humped out to what he considered close enough to the end, about two feet away.",It was made of white-painted wood and was about seven inches long.,"But, then, you know that only too well.""","Don't you wish to ride home, too?""","Thus, I imagine that in the ancient days, when it spotted a rocket shape, which would then have been a genuine spaceship and not a mockup, it would have detoured around it.","""Ah,"" said Miran, ""you are thinking of the Tale of Samdroo, the Tailor Who Turned Sailor.",He had an officer with him.,"Thinking that he must be a survivor who had wandered off in a dazed condition, Green opened his mouth to speak to him.","Nine others were there, too, Grizquetr, Soon, Miran, Inzax, three women, two little girls.","And Lady Luck, alarmed at all the hard knocks she was getting, struggled out of his shirt pocket and slipped into the forest.","Swiftly he brought the punk up, still holding the coat over it for protection from the drizzle and also from any watching eyes.",You'll learn in time.,"He jumped up on a little ledge, seized a thick vine and hauled himself up to another minor projection.","The third day Miran was positively a tub of nerves, jittery, sweating, pacing back and forth.",He was still sulking at the foot of the mast.,"""Only that he was so drunk he'd passed out and was snoring like a pig.",He reached into the huge purse he carried slung over his shoulder and pulled out a little golden idol of the patron deity of the Clan Effenycan.,"In his hand he held a priest's green robe, the sacerdotal hexagonal spectacles and a mask for the lower part of the face.",Green was intrigued by the magical charms being hawked everywhere.,"""Oh no.","Now, he'd be gone conducting the hunting party up in the hills.",Its central location made it a great clearing house for goods from every country bordering the Xurdimur.,"Remember that the cannibals were after him, and he ran into the cave and came to just such a blank wall."
