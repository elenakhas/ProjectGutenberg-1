Was not that good-natured?,"In one word, sir, I’m neither mad nor a fool!—Your most obedient (_going_, _angrily_).","Archer, who had spent the night as a man who had the cares of government upon his shoulders, rose early in the morning, whilst everybody else was fast asleep.","I daresay you are quite correct; you must know best,” said the attorney, trembling for the agency.",The hat was held some time to the attorney’s son before he chose to see it.,"or who would toil for popular applause?”  A few words spoken in a decisive tone by a new voice operated as a charm, and the playhouse was in an instant metamorphosed in the eyes of the spectators.","I’m so weak, I cannot help laughing to-day.” The packthread cracked.","It was we kept her, and we hopes, ma’am, as you _are_—as you _seem_ so good, you won’t take it amiss.” Miss Somers and her sister smiled at the affectionate simplicity with which Susan’s little brothers undertook her defence, and they were, from this slight circumstance, disposed to think yet more favourably of a family which seemed so well united.","He never saw a man carve better than the gentleman opposite him, who was the curate of the parish.","One must ask a wit, like a fine singer, so often.","can’t you?” said Piedro, in a supplicating tone; “_can’t_ you have thoughts of it?",(_Exit Finsbury_.),"Well, what are you fumbling for?” “For money!” said Fisher, colouring.",Mr. Case began to fear that he had mistaken his game in quarrelling with this family.,“Gone!,"“Dear me, Miss Marianne, if you would not make such a rout,” cried Mrs. Tattle.","(_Exeunt Mrs. Talbot_, _Louisa_, _Farmer_, _Landlord and Waiter_.)",_Talb._  I do please.,"Keep them for Bursal or Lord John, or some of those who like them.","“Oh, nothing, not much,” said Susan; “only that I wanted the egg in a great hurry for father, it would not have vexed me—to be sure I should have clipped my guinea-hen’s wings, and then she could not have flown over the hedge; but let us think no more about it, now,” added she, twinkling away a tear.",They are all gone!” said she; and she hid her face in Leonora’s lap.,"“Wring it, then,” said Archer.","Hey, Susan is this your first baking?” “Oh, no, no,” said her father, “I have her first baking snug here, besides, in my pocket.",_Landlord_.,"it’s none of mine, I never take what does not belong to me.” “True, right, very proper, of course,” said Mr. Case; “but then you have no interest in life in the land in question?” “None.” “Then why so stiff about it, Price?","“But you have lost, I understand, the pleasure of going to the play to-night.” “I don’t think anything—much, I mean, of that, sir,” answered Franklin, smiling.",But all kept aloof.,I suppose I’d best send your own servant?,_Burs._  _Infinite credit_!,"I have lived upon charity, and I scraped together a guinea and a half and upwards, and I was travelling with it to my grandson, in the north, with him to end my days—but (_sighing_)— _Just._  But what?","Will you give me that piece of the honey-comb that lies there?” “That bit of honey-comb is for my mother’s breakfast,” said Susan;

but I tell ye all, Sir Arthur gave us this play-green for ever, on account of her being so good.” You see, at last Attorney Case, with all his cunning has not proved a match for “Simple Susan.” THE WHITE PIGEON.","Oh, how could you do so?” “I was throwing weeds and rubbish over the wall, and by accident a great lump of couch-grass, with stones hanging to the roots, fell upon your bell-glass, and broke it, as you see.” Maurice lifted up the lump of couch-grass, which had fallen through the broken glass upon his cucumbers, and he looked at his cucumbers for a moment in silence—“Oh, my poor cucumbers!",_Farm._ (_striking his stick on the floor_).,They were at supper when he returned.,"Her head, indeed, had been running upon her poor lamb.",_Wheel._  Clever?,Some dishonest person had carried it all off.,"At last, “Where is Leonora?” cried one of them;
