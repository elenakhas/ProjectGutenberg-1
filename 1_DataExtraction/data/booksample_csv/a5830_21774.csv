"That invulnerable spark of vivid life, that ""inward light"" which these men find at their own centres when they seek for it, is for them an earnest of the Uncreated Light, the ineffable splendour of God, dwelling at, and energising within the heart of things: for this spark is at once one with, yet separate from, the Universal Soul.","They mean by this word, not a notion, however august; but an experienced Fact so vivid, that against it the so-called facts of daily life look shadowy and insecure.","CHAPTER IV MEDITATION AND RECOLLECTION Recollection, the art which the practical man is now invited to learn, is in essence no more and no less than the subjection of the attention to the control of the will.","Seen from the true centre of personality, instead of the usual angle of self-interest, their scattered parts arrange themselves in order: you begin to perceive those graduated levels of Reality with which a purified and intensified consciousness can unite.",Has it never happened to you to lose yourself for a moment in a swift and satisfying experience for which you found no name?,"It becomes apparent to you that the declaration of Plotinus, accepted or repeated by all the mystics, concerning a ""higher"" and a ""lower"" life, and the cleavage that exists between them, has a certain justification even in the experience of the ordinary man.","Moreover, to that diffused and impersonal sense of the Infinite, in which you have dipped yourself, and which swallows up and completes all the ideas your mind has ever built up with the help of the categories of time and space, is now added the consciousness of a Living Fact which includes, transcends, completes all that you mean by the categories of personality and of life.","In essence, it is one continuous out-flowing movement towards that boundless heavenly consciousness where the ""flaming ramparts"" which shut you from true communion with all other selves and things is done away; an unbroken process of expansion and simplification, which is nothing more or less than the growth of the spirit of love, the full flowering of the patriotic sense.","That old comfortable clinging life, protected by its hard shell from the living waters of the sea, must now come to an end.","You fluctuate miserably between their attractions and their claims; and will have no peace until these claims have been met, and the apparent opposition between them resolved.","You do not, you never will know, _what_ this Objective is: for as Dionysius teaches, ""if any one saw God and understood what he saw, then it was not God that he saw, but something that belongs to Him.""","How, then, can a wholesale and uncritical acceptance of my sensations help me to unite with Reality?","It will depend also on the steady continuance--often perhaps through long periods of darkness and boredom--of that poise to which you have been trained: the stretching-out of the loving and surrendered will into the dimness and silence, the continued trustful habitation of the soul in the atmosphere of the Essential World.",You are not free.,It contains within itself the sum of all the processes through which thought would pass in the act of attaining the same goal: supposing thought to have reached--as it has not--the high pitch at which it was capable of thinking its way all along this road.,"To ""bring Eternity into Time,"" the ""invisible into concrete expression""; to ""be to the Eternal Goodness what his own hand is to a man""--these are the plainly expressed desires of all the great mystics.","Nor are you to suppose that this enlargement will be limited to certain new spiritual perceptions, which the art of contemplation has made possible for you: that it will merely draw the curtain from a window out of which you have never looked.","What would it mean for a soul that truly captured it; this life in which the emphasis should lie on the immediate percepts, the messages the world pours in on us, instead of on the sophisticated universe into which our clever brains transmute them?","But whosoever seeketh, loveth, and pursueth goodness, as goodness and for the sake of goodness, and maketh that his end--for nothing but the love of goodness, not for love of the I, Me, Mine, Self, and the like--he will find the highest good, for he seeketh it aright, and they who seek it otherwise do err.""","It is to stand for an instant at the Poet's side, and see that Poem of which you have deciphered separate phrases in the earlier form of contemplation.","""Mad with joy, life and death dance to the rhythm of this music:     The hills and the sea and the earth dance:     The world of man dances in laughter and tears.""","It is not, therefore, a purely mystical activity.",.,"There will be many who feel a certain scepticism as to the possibility of the undertaking here suggested to them; a prudent unwillingness to sacrifice their old comfortably upholstered universe, on the mere promise that they will receive a new heaven and a new earth in exchange.","If your turn be to religion, the richest and most evocative of fields is open to your choice: from the plaster image to the mysteries of Faith.",You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them         shape!,"This experience might be called in essence ""absolute sensation.""","Therefore the mystics tell us perpetually that ""selfhood must be killed"" before Reality can be attained.",The life of the seer is changed by it for ever.,"We turn back therefore to a further examination of the truism--so obvious to those who are philosophers, so exasperating to those who are not--that man dwells, under normal conditions, in a world of imagination rather than a world of facts; that the universe in which he lives and at which he looks is but a construction which the mind has made from some few amongst the wealth of materials at its disposal.","A mere cataloguing of all the plants-- though this were far better than your old game of indexing your own poor photographs of them--will never give you access to the Unity, the Fact, whatever it may be, which manifests itself through them.","Hence, if you accept in a spirit of trust the suggestions which have been made to you-- and I acknowledge that here at the beginning an attitude of faith is essential--and if you practise with diligence the arts which I have described: then, sooner or later, you will inevitably find yourself deeply and permanently changed by them--will perceive that you have become a ""new man.""","Magic presences throng the roadside, or cry salutations to him from the hidden fields.","This is the substance of that redemption of the world, which all religions proclaim or demand: the consummation which is crudely imagined in the Apocalyptic dreams of the prophets and seers.","This discovery of your fraternal link with all living things, this down-sinking of your arrogant personality into the great generous stream of life, marks an important stage in your apprehension of that Science of Love which contemplation is to teach.","therein all the workings of the reason fail.""","The doctrine of Plotinus concerning a higher life of unity, a lower life of multiplicity, possible to every human spirit, will now appear to you not a fantastic theory, but a plain statement of fact, which you have verified in your own experience.","It is now another Power which seeks the separated spirit and demands it; which knocks at the closed door of the narrow personality; which penetrates the contemplative consciousness through and through, speaking, stirring, compelling it; which sometimes, by its secret irresistible pressure, wins even the most recalcitrant in spite of themselves.","""None,"" says Ruysbroeck, putting this same experience, this meek outstreaming of the bewildered spirit, into other language, ""is sure of Eternal Life, unless he has died with his own attributes wholly into God.""","Eluding the flicker of the arc-lamps, thence through an upper window we may glimpse a perpetual star.","But it is not the man, it is merely his mental machinery which is under this ""necessity.""","You are lost in a wilderness, a solitude, a dim strange state of which you can say nothing, since it offers no material to your image-making mind.","It is indeed only when he reaches these levels, and feels within himself this creative freedom--this full actualisation of himself--on the one hand: on the other hand the sense of a world-order, a love and energy on which he depends and with whose interests he is now at one, that man becomes fully human, capable of living the real life of Eternity in the midst of the world of time.","You will not have peace until you do away with all banks and hedges, and exchange the garden for the wilderness that is unwalled; that wild strange place of silence where ""lovers lose themselves.""","Then you will observe that you have entered into an intense and vivid silence: a silence which exists in itself, through and in spite of the ceaseless noises of your normal world.","It is a natural human activity, no more involving the great powers and sublime experiences of the mystical saints and philosophers than the ordinary enjoyment of music involves the special creative powers of the great musician.","Further, you will observe more and more clearly, that the stuff of your external world, the method and machinery of the common life, is not merely passively but actively inconsistent with your sharp interior vision of truth.","It is, as it were, a responsive act of the organism to those Supernal Powers without, which touch and stir it.",Even those objects which minister to our sense-life may well be used to nourish our spirits too.,"The walls of the church, limiting the range of our attention, shutting out the torrent of life, with its insistent demands and appeals, make possible our apprehension of this deep eternal peace.","In his works, he is ever trying to reveal the secret of his own deeper life and wider vision, and to help his fellow men to share it: hence he provides the clearest, most orderly, most practical teachings on the art of contemplation that we are likely to find.","It would mean the exchanging of the neat conceptual world our thoughts build up, fenced in by the solid ramparts of the possible, for the inconceivable richness of that unwalled world from which we have subtracted it.","""Take your seat within the heart of the thousand-petaled lotus,"" cries the Eastern visionary.","Such an experience of Eternity, the attainment of that intuitive awareness, that meek and simple self-mergence, which the mystics call sometimes, according to its degree and special circumstances, the Quiet, the Desert of God, the Divine Dark, represents the utmost that human consciousness can do of itself towards the achievement of union with Reality.","All adventurous endeavours, all splendour of pain and all beauty of play--more, that grey unceasing effort of existence which makes up the groundwork of the social web, and the ineffective hopes, enthusiasms, and loves which transfuse it--all these will be seen and felt by you at last as full of glory, full of meaning; for you will see them with innocent, attentive, disinterested eyes, feel them as infinitely significant and adorable parts of the Transcendent Whole in which you also are immersed.","On it you fix your attention; with it you ""unite.""",exclaims Ruysbroeck.,"You, in this preliminary movement of recollection, are saying your first deliberate No to the claim which the world of appearance makes to a total possession of your consciousness: and are thus making possible some contact between that consciousness and the World of Reality.","The mystical character is far more important: and its chief ingredients are courage, singleness of heart, and self-control.","Tension, ardour, are of its essence: it demands the perpetual exercise of industry and courage.","What is it, then, which distinguishes the outlook of great poets and artists from the arrogant subjectivism of common sense?","So, too, the road is more logically planned, falls into more comprehensible stages, than those who dwell in a world of single vision are willing to believe.","A link of love now binds you to it for evermore: in spite of derelictions, in spite of darkness and suffering, your will is harmonised with the Will that informs the Whole.",They react fully to both: for them there is no conflict between the parochial and the patriotic sense.,What next?,"The character of our consciousness, intermediate between Eternity and Time, and ever ready to swing between them, makes such a device, such a concrete aid to concentration, essential to us.","This life shall not be abstract and dreamy, made up, as some imagine, of negations.",Is that a theophany too?,"From the transitional plane of darkness, you will be reborn into another ""world,"" another stage of realisation: and find yourself, literally, to be other than you were before.","Poets, gazing thus at the ""flower in the crannied wall"" or the ""green thing that stands in the way,"" have been led deep into the heart of its life; there to discern the secret of the universe.","They hear all about them the delicate music of growth, and see the ""new colour"" of which the mystics speak.","Compare this with your normal attitude to the world, practical man: your quiet certitude that you are well within your rights in pushing the claims of ""the I, the Me, the Mine""; your habit, if you be religious, of asking for the weather and the government that you want, of persuading the Supernal Powers to take a special interest in your national or personal health and prosperity.","Here all the highest values of existence are stored for him: and it is because of his existence within this Eternal Reality, his patriotic relationship to it, that the efforts and experiences of the time-world have significance for him.","Your changing scrap of vitality contributes to its corporate life; and contributes the more effectively since a new, intuitive sympathy has now made its interests your own.","The coloured scene at which you look so trustfully owes, in fact, much of its character to the activities of the seer: to that process of thought--concept--cogitation, from which Keats prayed with so great an ardour to escape, when he exclaimed in words which will seem to you, according to the temper of your mind, either an invitation to the higher laziness or one of the most profound aspirations of the soul, ""O for a life of sensations rather than thoughts!""","Its paradoxes and inequalities will be disclosed as true constituents of its beauty, an inconceivable splendour will be shaken out from its dingiest folds.","There, finally, is the rock and refuge of the seeking consciousness wearied by the ceaseless process of the flux.","Look with the eye of contemplation on the most dissipated tabby of the streets, and you shall discern the celestial quality of life set like an aureole about his tattered ears, and hear in his strident mew an echo of     ""The deep enthusiastic joy,     The rapture of the hallelujah sent     From all that breathes and is.""","Clearly, the abolition of discursive thought is not to absolve you from the obligations of industry.","Did they wreck you utterly, that Ocean would receive you; and there you would find, overwhelming and transfusing you, the unfathomable Substance of all life and joy.","This brings with it the precious quality of suppleness, the power of responding with ease and simplicity to the great rhythms of life; and this will only come when the ungainly ""lump"" of sin is broken, and the verb ""to have,"" which expresses its reaction to existence, is ejected from the centre of your consciousness.",It represents the next phase in your gradual achievement of Reality.,For him the chief factor of existence is his own movement along the road; a movement which he intends to accomplish as efficiently and comfortably as he can.
