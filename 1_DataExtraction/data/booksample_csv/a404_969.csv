but I had not strength to confront him now: my tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth; I was well-nigh sinking to the earth, and I almost wondered he did not hear the beating of my heart above the low sighing of the wind and the fitful rustle of the falling leaves.","She, however, attentively watched my looks, and her artist’s pride was gratified, no doubt, to read my heartfelt admiration in my eyes.","Tell me what it is, that I may be your mediator, and make you friends again.'","‘Oh, I’m so glad you’re come, Walter?’ cried his sister.","Remember you are not yet nineteen, and many years are yet to pass before any one can set you down as an old maid: you cannot tell what Providence may have in store for you.",But are you happy?',I heard it plainly enough.,"It may be only an ignis fatuus, after all, but it can do no harm to follow it with my eyes and rejoice in its lustre, as long as it does not lure me from the path I ought to keep; and I think it will not, for I have thought deeply on my aunt's advice, and I see clearly, now, the folly of throwing myself away on one that is unworthy of all the love I have to give, and incapable of responding to the best and deepest feelings of my inmost heart--so clearly, that even if I should see him again, and if he should remember me and love me still (which, alas!",‘“Mrs.,"I went down to dinner, but I could not force myself to eat.","‘You must, and shall tell me,’ was added, more vehemently, and the speaker threw himself on his knees beside me on the rug, and forcibly possessed himself of my hand; but I hastily caught it away, and replied,—‘It is nothing to you, Mr. Huntingdon.’ ‘Are you sure it is nothing to me?’ he returned; ‘can you swear that you were not thinking of me while you wept?’  This was unendurable.","I disclaimed all title to it, telling her her husband was predisposed to amendment before I added my mite of exhortation and encouragement, and that I had only done what she might, and ought to have done herself.","'I can't understand it at all,' said he, in bewildered perplexity.",But henceforth we are husband and wife only in the name.',‘I have trusted to the testimony of no third person.,"‘Oh, no!’ cried she; ‘I couldn’t have influenced him, I’m sure, by anything that I could have said.","‘No; but here is another for you.’ Instead of taking it quietly, I likewise took the hand that offered it, and looked into her face.","'No, not now--I don't know yet precisely what it is, or how to say it,' replied I, with more truth than wisdom; and then, fearing lest she should turn me out of the house, I began talking about indifferent matters in order to gain time.",'Go to the deuce!',"cried I, embracing my faithful friend.",But the night was long and dark: the snow heavily clogged the wheels and balled the horses' feet; the animals were consumedly lazy; the coachman most execrably cautious; the passengers confoundedly apathetic in their supine indifference to the rate of our progression.,"And we sauntered through the garden, and talked of the flowers, the trees, and the book, and then of other things.","'Hallo, Huntingdon!'",‘Remember my guardians.,What a good thing it is to be able to command one's temper!,"I now forgave him from my heart his reckless slight of me, and I felt ashamed at my pettish resentment of such a trifle--ashamed too of those bitter envious pangs that gnawed my inmost heart, in spite of all this admiration and delight.","I wish I could render the incentives to every other equally innoxious in his case.’ ‘But by such means,’ said I, ‘you will never render him virtuous.—What is it that constitutes virtue, Mrs. Graham?","‘Well!’ exclaimed the injured man, in a tone of pseudo-resignation.","Brilliant success, of course, I did not look for, but some degree of security from positive failure was indispensable: I must not take my son to starve.","'I shall not feel myself neglected: while you are doing your duty, Arthur, I shall never complain of neglect.","and returned my close embrace with a fervour like old times, and then he started, and, in a tone of absolute terror, exclaimed, 'Helen!","'You don't grudge me these attentions, do you, Helen?'","'I don't want them,' said she.","In vain I attempted to drive him away by giving a loose to my exasperated feelings, even to positive rudeness: nothing could convince him that his presence was disagreeable.",He departed.,"Milicent's own heart told her how much it cost me to make this acknowledgment; and, with a childlike impulse, she expressed her sympathy by suddenly kissing my cheek, without a word of reply, and then turning quickly away, caught up her baby, and hid her face in its frock.","She did not speak, but flew to her desk, and snatching thence what seemed a thick album or manuscript volume, hastily tore away a few leaves from the end, and thrust the rest into my hand, saying, ‘You needn’t read it all; but take it home with you,’ and hurried from the room.","He fervently embraced me, and though I shed a torrent of tears, I think I never was happier in my life than at that moment.","You mad creature, how could you come out in your light evening dress this chill autumn night?'","On such occasions I have sometimes been startled by a subtle, fiendish suggestion inciting me to show him the contrary by a seeming encouragement of Hargrave's advances; but such ideas are banished in a moment with horror and self-abasement; and then I hate him tenfold more than ever for having brought me to this!--God pardon me for it and all my sinful thoughts!",'Most certainly I do.,"I have not the heart to do it, for I think he is ashamed of himself-he must be so indeed, and such inquiries could not fail to be painful to both.","said she, as she took it in her hand.","In a little while, however, I was sensible that some one was approaching me, with a light, but slow and hesitating tread.",Benson paused aghast and looked at me.,Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.,"'Markham, will you come?","Instinctively, I guessed who it was, and, on looking up, was less surprised than delighted to see Mr. Huntingdon smiling upon me.","I felt no joy but that his sister was at length released from her afflictive, overwhelming toil--no hope but that she would in time recover from the effects of it, and be suffered to rest in peace and quietness, at least, for the remainder of her life.","But instead of boring you with my chagrin, my expectations and disappointments, my fluctuations of dull despondency and flickering hope, my varying resolutions, now to drop it, and now to persevere--now to make a bold push, and now to let things pass and patiently abide my time,--I will employ myself in settling the business of one or two of the characters introduced in the course of this narrative, whom I may not have occasion to mention again.","if I had but known her before, how much degradation and misery I should have been spared!","‘It is summer yet,’ she replied.",When must it be?,At last his patience was tired out.,"He commenced a passionate protestation of the truth and fervour of his attachment, which I cut short by another question:— ‘But is it not a selfish love?","I never saw her speak much to Mr. Huntingdon; but he would frequently look into the school-room to see how little Arthur got on with his new companion, when I was not there.","'He couldn't help it, Arthur,' said I; 'the carpet caught his foot, and there's no great harm done.","And remember your situation, dearest Helen; on your health, you know, depends the health, if not the life, of our future hope.'",He stayed away some ten or twelve days.,"mamma will weary all about her before she tires herself with her exertions; and as for Mr. Oldfield, she has given him to understand that I have refused his offer, not from any dislike of his person, but merely because I am giddy and young, and cannot at present reconcile myself to the thoughts of marriage under any circumstances: but by next season, she has no doubt, I shall have more sense, and hopes my girlish fancies will be worn away.","I think not;
