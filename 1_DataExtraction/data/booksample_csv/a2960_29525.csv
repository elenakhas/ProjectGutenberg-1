was back again, but this time above the leech.",Into spores.,Conners asked.,It should be dealt with in its own terms.,"""Why did they have to panic?","If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.",The soldier brought him to a tent.,"""Something like this, you can't let it block the road, Professor.",*       *       *       *       * It had been a long wait after the first rich food.,"Methodically, it fed on the Earth, wondering where the rich food was.",Micheals stooped and went in.,"We can never have any security while it lives.""","""Ride over it.""","""Have you ever heard of Antaeus?""","Billions of them, waiting to be fed.","Unconscious, they floated in the emptiness of space.","After that, people had to be evacuated, which took more time.","The greater radiation of day was followed by the lesser energy of night many times, as the leech ate away the earth beneath it, absorbed the air around it, and grew.","""I don't know what you've got here,"" the general said.",No thought of containing it.,"""Haven't those experts decided yet?""","""The leech has to be blown up quick.","If an individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed.","White-faced, the driver climbed to the hood of his

Army trucks rolled past.","""Yes.","Its cells, recklessly expending energy, shouted for a decision.","""What did you do?""","""You can't block this road,"" the general said.",The leech went after as quickly as its bulk would allow.,This isn't exactly the way I wanted to do it.,"On the radar screen, they saw a blob pursuing a dot.",It was anthropomorphic of O'Donnell to see the leech as an enemy.,"""Pardon me, sir,"" a soldier said, coming up behind him.","My job is to destroy it, by any means in my power, and at once.","The leech was smashed, broken up, destroyed.","""I don't think you understand me,"" Micheals said.","Mass, converted back to energy to make the trip, was used up.",Its first realization was of the impossible smallness of its body.,"General O'Donnell was given permission to use hydrogen bombs, contingent on the approval of his scientists.","But then there was no more food, and the next star was an enormous distance away.",Then Washington wanted to know if
