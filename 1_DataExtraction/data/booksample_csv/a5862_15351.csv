and in so far as he is unable thus to separate himself temporarily from his circumstances he confesses that he is less a personality than a bundle of reactions to familiar stimuli.,"Little Wars (_Small, Maynard & Company, Boston, Massachusetts_).","By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright) agreement.","This broad generalisation omits any consideration of the merely uneducated, such as Hoopdriver or Kipps, and the many women he has drawn.","This Misery of Boots (_Ball Publishing Company, Boston, Massachusetts_).",That's all there is in life for me beyond food and shelter and tidying up.,"I am distinctly sorry for Mr Brumley, but I should have been seriously disappointed in Ellen Harman if she had consented to marry him.","The change of scale, however, so long as it was changing, presents in another metaphor the old contrasts.","But we doubt the quality of his determination and of the lasting influence of the ""more wonderful desires and ambitions replacing those discrepant dreams.""",1904.,Thirty Strange Stories (_Harper_).,"The same theme is presented, but in other circumstances.","They still possessed the earth on sufferance; since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to find the day-lit surface intolerable.",The War of the Worlds (_Heinemann_).,"As the ""high-browed gentleman living at Highbury"" explains: ""Nothing can better demonstrate the collective dullness of our community, the crying need for a strenuous, intellectual renewal, than the consideration of that vast mass of useless, uncomfortable, under-educated, under-trained, and altogether pitiable people we contemplate when we use that inaccurate and misleading term, the Lower Middle Class.",I am less certain of his position as a novelist.,"If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.",He is before all else devoted to the services of growth and progress.,"It is, in fact, the least common of qualities.","That way of escape, however, soon raised financial obstructions to Trafford's work.",Door in the Wall and Other Stories (_Mitchell Kennerley_).,"It would be impossible in an exposition of this kind to dissect these essays in detail, nor would it be desirable.",In this form Mr Wells displays nothing but the exuberance of his invention.,Wheels of Chance--A Bicycling Idyll (_Macmillan Company_).,He failed as a retail chemist in Wimblehurst.,The picture of the Martians themselves develops in one direction the theory of human evolution expressed in _The Man of the Year Million_.,1913.,As a machine it works; as an ideal it lacks any presentation of the thing we call beauty.,And that is the moral we may lay to heart from the presentation of these three quite lovable and quite futile draper's assistants.,1905.,1904.,"We leave him at the door of the Putney shop full of resolution to read, to undertake his own education, in some way, no doubt, to better himself, as he might have phrased it.",_Tono-Bungay_ (1909) touches only casually on the sex question.,Section 1.,History of Mr Polly (_Duffield_).,And in this thing I claim that the conscious purpose of the artist is of comparatively small account.,1903.,"And no man can hope to dominate those forces, if he is content to let his opinions crystallise at the age of thirty-five or so.","_Mankind in the Making_ dealt very largely with education directed to a particular end, but in the book I am now considering may be found certain outlets for the expression of the less consistently strenuous.",You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.,"Ponderevo's wife--the inimitable Aunt Susan--called him ""Teddy"" and his nephew endorses the appropriateness of that diminutive; he affirms that there was a characteristic ""teddiness"" about Uncle Ponderevo.",I do not mean by it that Mr Wells has ever sat down to write a novel with the deliberate intention of converting an honest reader or so.,"He even introduced a contemporary critic of Utopian conditions in the shape of the talkative person, ""a conscious Ishmaelite in the world of wit, and in some subtly inexplicable way a most consummate ass.""",It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.,1904.,1911.,"He does not believe in the private ownership of land, for example, but I do not remember that he has ever advocated the means of the ""Single Tax.""","In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.","Like Bensington, he saw, ""behind the grotesque shapes and accidents of the present, the coming world of giants and all the mighty things the future has in store--vague and splendid, like some glittering palace seen suddenly in the passing of a sunbeam far away.""",I find no hint of sweetness or persuasiveness on that side.,Floor Games (A book about play for children) (_Palmer_).,1898.,"I choose to take as representative such a passage as the following, with all its splendid vagueness and lack of dogma, rather than a definite expression of belief that Mr Wells does not believe in a personal immortality.",New Worlds for Old (_Constable_).,The Country of the Blind and Other Stories (_Nelson_).,"And later he repeats: ""It struggles to exist, becomes conscious, becomes now conscious of itself.",In many ways _Tono-Bungay_ is the best novel that Mr Wells has given us.,"Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain ""Defects,"" such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.","And I make an application of the parable for my own purposes, and wonder how far the curiosity of Mr Wells' readers will carry them into the great mystery that lies behind the illusion of this apparently obvious world.","And Bensington, the other experimenter, succeeded in separating a food that produced regular instead of intermittent growth.","Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.",See paragraph 1.E below.,"Indeed, I think that _The War in the Air_ is the greatest of Mr Wells' achievements in fantasy that has a deeper purpose than mere amusement.","asks Mr Wells in the person of the supposed narrator and points that question on a later page as follows:--""At the climax of his Boom, my uncle at the most sparing estimate must have possessed in substance and credit about two million pounds' worth of property to set off against his vague colossal liabilities, and from first to last he must have had a controlling influence in the direction of nearly thirty millions.","The latter, whatever his idea, and it may be a brilliant idea, is always intent on elaborating the wonder of his theme by direct description.","When she was enlarged from the solitude of confinement in a cell, she was tricked and bullied into the resumption of her marital engagements.","One section of the book is a trifle too hilarious, coming perilously near to farce, but underlying the steady humour of it all is a perfectly consistent, even saddening, criticism of the Hoopdriver type.","As he says in this book: ""A human being who is a philosopher in the first place, a teacher in the first place, or a statesman in the first place, is thereby and inevitably--though he bring God-like gifts to the pretence--a quack.""",1899.,"- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days      of receipt of the work.","And for a moment in _The New Machiavelli_, and again in his next book, _Marriage_, he has a passing vision of some greater movement of which we are but the imperfect instruments.",1.F.5.,"But she was also the personification of ""other dreams.""",Kipps (_Scribners_).,The Time Machine--An Invention (_Heinemann_).,The Discovery of the Future (A Lecture given at the Royal Institute).
