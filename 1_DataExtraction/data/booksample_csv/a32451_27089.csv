"Square corners, painted olive drab.","While I was hunting around for some other idea, Karpin spoke up again, for the first time in maybe twenty minutes.",The manager--a man named Teaking--went well with the office.,"It was just an X, that's all, shakily scrawled in yellow paint, with the initials ""J-A"" scrawled much smaller beside it.",There's only one way to handle a blunt old man.,"McCann's body, floating around in the blackness, might just be found by somebody.","He sets the rocket going, and off goes McCann.",Faded slippers were on his feet.,"""Well,"" I said, ""there's this business of going to Chemisant City.","My doubt must have showed in my face, because he added, ""Mister, there isn't enough gravity on this place to shoot craps with.""","I mean, it wouldn't simply go floating off into space, would it?""",And my instinct said Ab Karpin was lying in his teeth.,"I was trying my best to point out to him that the company would spend more than it would save if it sent me all the way out to the asteroids, a prospect I could feel coming and one which I wasn't ready to cry hosannah over.","""You should have been.",McCann left a hand-written will bequeathing all his possessions to Karpin.,"No problem, boy, there wasn't any air in there to begin with.",And then it would simply _fall_ into the sun.,"he asked, with the first real sign of animation I'd seen in him yet.","""I got a big claim here.""","""Jafe McCann died just a bit too soon.","I saw how that cash-return form fit in, and how it made perfect sense.","I'd like getting back to Atronics City, and having this all straightened out, and then taking the very next liner straight back to Earth.","I mean, a little one like this.",I asked.,"The waiting room was cozy and surprisingly large, large enough to comfortably hold the six maroon leather sofas scattered here and there on the pale green carpet, flanked by bronze ashtray stands.","But I didn't find any of these either as I plodded along, being sure to keep one magnetted boot always in contact with the ground.",By the time I'd stripped off the suit he was back to work.,"""Sure,"" he said.","""You said McCann had gone out to paint the X,"" I said.",Atronics City had been Karpin's and McCann's home base.,"_Karpin_ might know that such-and-such an asteroid was nothing but worthless stone, but the guy who stops there and finds McCann's body might _not_ know it.","""Accidental.""","But, wait a second.",The rest of them work in the service occupations--running the bars and grocery stores and so on--that keep the company employees alive and relatively happy.,"""The company isn't accusing you of anything, but it has to be sure everything's on the up and up before it pays out any ten thousand credits.",Preferably a body.,"It was closer, he said, but it couldn't have been closer by more than a couple of hours.","""You can sleep over, if you want.""","""Help yourself,"" he said, in a pretty poor attempt at genial hospitality.","""Frankly,"" I said, ""I'm no expert on low gravity and asteroids.","Makes it tough on the conditioner.""","""You don't want to make too many wild accusations,"" he shouted, his voice shaking.","Close-mouthed, anti-social, fiercely independent, incurably romantic, always convinced that the big strike is just a piece of rock away.","He could have been forty, and he could have been ninety, but he was probably somewhere the other side of fifty.",I considered my answer.,Or at least I saw part of it.,"This would be the claim, and this is where I would find Karpin, sitting on his property while waiting for the sale to go through.","Not until the day before McCann died.""","*       *       * It was all one room, roughly circular, with a diameter of about fifteen feet.",Call it ten thousand credits even.,"""How did this accident happen anyway?""","And not satisfied with _that_, you filled out a cash-return form and tried to collect your money as your own heir.","Because this chunk of rock was valuable, that's why not.","So I said, ""I've just had a shaky four-hour ride coming out here.","""Shut the door,"" he said.","He welcomed me politely, but curiously, and I said, ""I wonder if you know a prospector named Ab Karpin?""","""There's a chance it's a forgery?""","He moved too fast, jerked his muscles too hard, and went sailing up and over the cot and ricocheted off the dome wall.","""Why's that?","""I'll tell you how it is,"" I said.","There was a Geiger counter, an automatic spectrograph, two atmosphere suits, a torsion densimeter, a core-cutting drill, a few small hammers and picks, two spare air tanks, boxes of food concentrate, a paint tube, a doorless jimmy-john and two small metal boxes about eight inches cube.","None of my ideas, it seemed, were happy ones.",On those I feel almost human.,"I was convinced of that, and now all I had to do was prove it.","""It sure would,"" he said.","The horizon was practically at arm's length, so it didn't take long for the dome to be out of sight.","""I see,"" I said sadly.","Twenty credits a day, plus fuel.","There's nothing to look at outside the dome but chunks of rock and the blackness of space anyway, and you've got all this cheap iron floating around in the vicinity, and all a dome's supposed to do is keep the air in.","""None.",He happens to write out the cash-return form just before dying.,"By the time we got to Atronics City, my insides had grown resigned to their fate.","As we talked, I kept finding myself holding unnecessarily tight to the arms of the chair.","""Jafe McCann was the money-minded part of the team.","If he'd lived, he would have repaid all his debts, I'm sure of it.","And if you didn't need human company, then you had everything.",That was a pity.,"McCann's dead.""",I've never been on an asteroid like this before.,"""He went out first.","""And that's what you're here for, eh?""","With this big strike in, Jafe McCann was the one who'd have to pay all that money.""","""Warm in here,"" I said."
