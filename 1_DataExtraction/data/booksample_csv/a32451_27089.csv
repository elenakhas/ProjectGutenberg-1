He could swindle his creditors and get away with it; they had no way of checking up and no reason to suspect a switch in identities.,"He knew I had him, but he tried not to show it.","From the inside, Atronics City is even jollier.","And that, so far as I could see, eliminated the possibilities.","""Why's that?","All at once, the idea that this anti-social old geezer had the drive or the imagination to murder his partner seemed ridiculous.","The agent waved at me, stony-faced, the conveyor belt trundled me outside the dome, and I kicked the weary rocket into life.","Up to this point, I couldn't attack the problem on a fact basis.","Karpin stood in the middle of the room, a small revolver in his hand.","So I said, ""I've just had a shaky four-hour ride coming out here.",*       *       * Have you ever taken an elevator ride when the gravity is practically non-existent?,"""I think I'd like that.""","he asked, with the first real sign of animation I'd seen in him yet.","""Goodbye,"" I said.","Now, all I needed was proof of murder.","What this means is that the suitcases have to be lashed down with the straps provided, and you and the operator have to hold on tight to the hand-grips placed here and there around the wall.","His mouth was thin, almost lipless.",That's why all the money stuff in the partnership was handled by McCann.,"End of Project

http://www.pgdp.net Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.",Ab Karpin was a dead ringer for all those other prospectors I'd seen back at Atronics City.,"""Crawl into your suit, little man,"" I said.","They're noisy as the dickens, they steer hard and drive erratically, and you can never carry what _I_ would consider a safe emergency excess of fuel.","That dramatic little touch about McCann's body hovering over the dome before disappearing into the void, that sounded more like the embellishment of fiction than the circumstance of truth.",*       *       * I'd had the right idea after all.,"His eyes were wide apart and small, so deep-set beneath shaggy brows that they seemed black.","No, he would aim McCann _back_, in the direction opposite to the direction or rotation of the asteroids.","""That's what you think, Henny,"" I said.","""How so?""",He nodded.,How?,That was what I was here about in the first place.,"When the red light flashed on and off, I spun the door, opened it, and stepped out onto the rock, moving very cautiously.","""The company isn't accusing you of anything, but it has to be sure everything's on the up and up before it pays out any ten thousand credits.",I knew for sure I was going to get a head cold.,"Maybe if I'd been sober I would have taken the scooter and gone after him, but I was _drunk_.""","""You're crazy.""","""Jafe McCann died just a bit too soon.","""I learn fast,"" I told him.","As for the gear inside the dome, it was functional and collapsible, and there wasn't a single item there that wasn't needed.","Because Karpin was in the process of selling it to one of the major companies, and that company would come along and chop this chunk of rock to pieces, getting the valuable metal out, and McCann's body would turn up in the first week of operations if Karpin were stupid enough to bury it here.","I wasn't sure where it led, or even if it led anywhere at all, but I was going to find out.","I believed that Karpin was lying, that he had murdered his partner.",They had maintained their partnership for fifteen years.,"This was where prospectors filed their claims, but it was a lot more than that.","I had to depend on _feeling_ now, the hunches and instincts of eight years in this job, hearing some people tell lies and other people tell the truth.","""Under duress, do you think?""","There were two chairs and a table to the right of the entry lock, two foldaway cots around the wall beyond them, the kitchen area next and a cluttered storage area around on the other side.",I'd more or less counted on finding it somehow.,"The way Karpin said it, it sounded smooth and natural.",But not today.,"""Not since they went out together the last time and made that strike.""",All I have to do is bring you back to Atronics City.,"The lock itself, of course, folded separately, into another box somewhat smaller than that.",See paragraph 1.C below.,Dirt can be patted down.,"""How did this accident happen anyway?""","""Well, it can't.","_Karpin_ might know that such-and-such an asteroid was nothing but worthless stone, but the guy who stops there and finds McCann's body might _not_ know it.",He was the one who signed for all the loans and all the equipment bought on credit.,"""You should have been.","At any rate, there I was at Atronics City.","None of my ideas, it seemed, were happy ones.","""Ged Stanton, Tangiers Mutual Insurance.","""Oh, Lord, not for a couple of months,"" he said.","He couldn't go to Atronics City, where he could have bought the rocket on credit, and he couldn't go to Chemisant City until the claim sale went through and he had some money to spend.","McCann's dead.""","I hear he got killed.""",I did--in my head--and came up with a figure of thirteen thousand and two hundred credits.,It would be something that conflicted with Karpin's story.,He looked up at my approach.,"I mean, it wouldn't simply go floating off into space, would it?""","Local citizens eased by me, their feet occasionally touching the iron pavement as they soared along, and I gave them all dirty looks.",And Atronics City seemed like the best place to get my information.,"""So,"" I went on, ""as soon as I turned McCann over to the law at Atronics City, I went and registered that claim myself.",There'll be plenty of people there to identify you.,Everything except human company.,The total effect of the place is suffocating.,"""That's a lie,"" he said, his voice getting shrill.","""I'll tell you how it is,"" I said.",The rest of them work in the service occupations--running the bars and grocery stores and so on--that keep the company employees alive and relatively happy.,He grinned a bit.,"But, wait a second.","Not until the day before McCann died."""
