"Sophia wished herself in the nethermost of Dante's hells, though in fact and reality she _was_ there already.","Are there not credible ""Varisker"" (as according to some authorities the inhabitants of Voigtland were called in Caesar's time--though others consider ""Narisker"" to have been the word), who have assured me that he bought bergamot pears in the open market-place, near the court-house, and cakes at a baker's stall, in his best suit of Sunday clothes?","This was lucky; the advocate could enter into partnership with the shoemaker, and it would be easy for these partners, by each contributing a groschen to the partnership funds, to obtain a two-groschen loaf.","Then the discords clashed and clanged more harshly yet; the shivering walls of the temple parted asunder, and the temple and the children sank--the earth and sun sank with them--and the boundless fabric of the universe Bank down before us, while high on the summit of immeasurable nature Jesus stood and gazed upon the sinking universe, besprent with thousand suns, and like a mine dug in the face of black eternal night; the suns being miners' lamps, and the milky way the veins of silvery ore. And as he gazed upon the grinding mass of worlds, the wild torch dance of starry will-o'-the-wisps, and all the coral banks of throbbing hearts--and saw how world by world shook forth its glimmering souls on to the Ocean of Death--then He, sublime, loftiest of finite beings, raised his eyes towards the nothingness and boundless void, saying, ""Oh dead, dumb, nothingness!","""But it was _you_, of course,"" said Lenette, _without_ any tone of interrogation, ""who told Leibgeber all about him, to begin with.""","The affection which we have deprived ourselves of by means of a long-continued, gradual process of chilling, is only to be regained by an equally lengthy process of warming.",Look ye down into the chasm athwart the face of which the ash-clouds float and fly.,"""So, could I not put the sermon-book, with its funeral preacher, in amongst _your_ books, that your wife might hear him, and think of death--of yours, that is to say--and so get more used to the idea of it?""","A mighty angel troubles and inspires the great ocean-pool of Bethesda; into its warm waves we plunge, with all our thousand aches and pains, and ascend from the water of life with our spasms all relaxed and our health and vigour renewed once more.","From all which it will readily appear how perfectly happy the advocate was during his honeymoon, when Lenette, in the most delightful manner, did all those things for him which he used previously to have to do for himself in a most miserable fashion and against the grain, making by unwearied sweepings and brushings his dithyrambic chartreuse as clean and level and smooth as a billiard-table.","He felt as though he himself with his old name, and his new, were going down to the grave.","Luna, elder Cato--if I mistake not thou hast seen, certainly once at the very least, that tender soul, which ought to dwell in (and heighten the tint of) a white rose in place of a body--Luna shed tears, half of delight (for they were half of sorrow for _everybody_ who was not there), half of delight not so much at the families of alders upon the rounded bank, or the Lombardy poplars lying trembling in intoxication of bliss in the gentle air which breathed about them, or the sunny green paths, as at _all this_ together (in the first place), and at the spring sky and the Rhine (which was showing that sky a picture, as it were, of its antipodean sky somewhere over America), and at the peace and gladness of her soul--but (above all) at the Alp in the centre of the island.",The evening wound a soft bandage about the pain of the morning.,"In an irritable impulse to be doing something or other, he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, and got hold of the profile of Herr von Blaise which he had clipped out (as we may remember) on the occasion when he stamped the glass wig to pieces (and with respect to which profile the only thing which had been distressing him for a twelvemonth past was that it was in his pocket, and not affixed to the gallows, where he could have stuck it with a hairpin the evening he went away).","As the woodpecker (naturalists call most gaudy-plumaged birds woodpeckers) winged his flight closer by them, they saw, as he passed them, that his face was a-glow with anger.","there the dirt-fly goes!""","Stiefel was there in the evening--a good deal of argument was going on, and Stiefel openly declared that he (with Salvian and other able theologians) was of opinion that the children of Israel (whose garments never wore into the minutest hole during all the forty years they passed in the wilderness) always continued of exactly the same _size_ (so as always to fit their clothes exactly) with the exception of children, in whose cases the clothes, which had been cut to fit them out of the wardrobes of the dead, grew with their bodies in length and breadth.","am clamped to the dust, and cannot soar up to them.","""Haven't I often asked the bookbinder myself,"" she said, ""not to hammer so hard upon his books, because my husband would hear him when he was making _his_.""","When he got down, he swore, in presence of the master of the house and all the lodgers assembled, that he was going to do his watchman's duty without his halberd, for the ghost had got hold of that; and in fact, he quivered like an aspen-leaf and his blood ran cold in his veins, every time his eye so much as rested for a moment on the Advocate's face.","the soul which has had to give up much, or has lost much, is too, too wretched on such an evening as this.","He took her hand, which, in her respect and awe of him, she half permitted, and kissed it stooping, but twisted his eyes up to her face, and said: ""Meddem!","""Don't you think,"" said Siebenkæs, in a friendly manner to Peltzstiefel, ""that if I'm going to write proper notices of Messrs. Frank and Steffens here, my wife should take care not to make a thundering noise, swishing away with her broom at my back?""","Nathalie, who had heard what the child said, came down, and said, with a blush, ""Is it I, darling?","A man can't go more suitably than with mock insignia, such as that, out of a life which has dished him up such a number of pasteboard pasties full of nothing but wind.","How is a man to get a coherent idea, fit to go to the printer and publisher, into his head with all this sweeping and scrubbing going on?""","The boding comet of the future was shorn of its sword, and went sweeping on, far brighter and whiter, into the blue expanse of heaven, passing athwart more brilliant constellations.","The pale and colourless shades flickered away to nothingness, as frosty fog dissolves before warm breath, and all grew void.","What advantage shall I reap in giving to the world this, my new edition of 'Siebenkæs,' embellished and perfected as it is with all the additions, corrections, and improvements which it has been in my power to make?",Ey!,"""The other day I cried so at reading Silly's letters (in Allwill's Papers) that I was obliged to put the book down.","At first among the market stalls; for the many-throated roaring, and the Olla Podrida of cheap pleasures, and the displayed pattern cards of all the rags out of, and upon, which we human clothes moths construct our covering cases and our abodes--all these caused his mind to sink deep into a sea of humoristic-melancholy reflections concerning this mosaic picture of a life of ours, made up as it is of so many little bits, many-tinted moments, motes, atoms, drops, dust, vapours.","As Siebenkaes now, with an outburst of anger, converted his judgment-seat into a stool of repentance for the Venner, whom he stigmatised as a canker-worm of feminine buds, a sparrowhawk, a housebreaker as regarded matrimonial treasures, and a crimp, trepanner, and soul-stealer of mated souls--vowing with the utmost warmth that it was Nathalie who had scornfully sent Rosa to the right-about, not Rosa who had rejected her: and as, of course, he interdicted her in the most peremptory terms from everything in the nature of dissemination or repetition of the Venner's lying demi-romance, he turned his unfortunate wife into a sour, pungent, Erfurt radish, from head to foot.","""I shan't be able,"" he went on, turning to Siebenkæs, and finishing a good portrait, ""to give that sneak and sharper there an account by word of mouth of my success, for a whole year to come; but by that time the one or two little touches of abuse which I have just lightly applied to him will be covered by the statute of limitations, and we shall be as good friends as ever again.""","He went back (but alone) to the pewter cupboard in the kitchen, and peeped through the rail to see whether there were two ranks of dishes or three.",The cuckoo (always her own sounding-board and multiplying echo) talked to him from the tree-top in mournful tones of sorrow; the sun was gone; the shadows were throwing thick veils of crape over the brightness of the day.,"Lenette!""",And I shouldn't have regretted having taken that oath had I seen the sudden blush which suffused her face next day when the money for the reviews and the snuff was brought.,"Just in front of our wedded pair, a master tailor of the Catholic confession was taking his walk, most sprucely attired in honour of the Feast of the Annunciation, like all the rest of his _pro_- and CON-fession.","Now let no one call our good Firmian over jealous or suspicious when, having just got well rid of one wretched sacrilegious robber of marriage honour, the Venner, the idea of a volcanic eruption which might throw stones and ashes all over a great tract of his life suddenly occurs to him; what if his friend Stiefel should be really (as it almost seems) falling in love with his wife, in all innocence, himself.","""Dear me,"" said the Rath, ""what may that be in flower there?""","And then I shall arise from the ground, pass into the angelic crowd, fall on the bosom of some distinguished descendant, and, throwing my arms around him, say, ""Thou, true, good, contented-minded, gentle son!","The blue day, which the red sky gives promise of, _does_, indeed, break in brightness; but it is in another world, where there is another sun.","stupid nonsense,"" she answered.","--Herr Heimlicher von Blasius, I have not the slightest intention of making use of libellous or abusive language to you, or of spouting an improvised pasquinade; I merely tell you, that you are an old rascal, a robber of orphans, a varnished villain, and everything else of the kind--for instance, a Polish bear, whose footmarks are just like a human being's.","""There, you see, I heard with my very own ears,"" she said, ""how that Unbeliever and Kill-joy there goes about coupling and marrying you in the Fantaisie at Bayreuth; and _this_ is the fellow an honest woman is expected to shake hands with, or touch with the tip of one of her fingers.""",We brighten and illuminate many a head which never dreams of thinking.,"_that_ I _cannot_, when I have lost my truest, my oldest friend.","""No, I suppose not,"" he went on.","inasmuch as, here below, we are nothing but images, delusively firm, and red of colour, standing on the edges of our holes, into which (like the ancient princes) we totter, crumbling to dust, when the unknown hand gives the mouldering images a shake--why do we not say (like Firmian), ""Why should I not forgive?","I shall not catalogue the whole of them, but merely quote a few specimens, e. g. 'The Forty-eight-pounder Paper' (he gratified himself by continually inventing new titles for these missives), of which the contents were: ""Stop the mouth of that tall sewing creature there, who sees perfectly well how busy I am with my writing, or I shall seize her by that throat with which she's baiting me.""","Now I thought I should portray, in his likeness, some of the more striking features of the great Buying-public; for he is a sort of portable miniature of it--like itself, he cares only for bread-studies, and beer-studies, for no talk but table-talk, no literature but politics--he knows that the magnet was only created to hold up his shop-door key if he chooses to stick it on to it--the tourmaline only to collect his tobacco ashes, his daughter Pauline to take the place of both (although she attracts stronger things, and with greater attractive power than either)--he knows no higher thing in the world than bread, and detests the town painter, who uses it to rub out pencil marks with.","Hence a universal Pythagorean noviciate would, sooner or later, give rise to epidemics, and Chartreuses of nuns would become pesthouses.","It was in the evening, before Leibgeber went back to his hotel (the Lizard, if I remember), and the deep black, half-orb of a thunder-cloud had gathered silently in the West, shrouding the sun, and mounting higher, and hanging more and more threateningly over the expectant world.","On this particular occasion, however, Schalaster drew our couple a little nearer together again.",Leibgeber had charged himself with the rest.,"I have to make a melancholy choice between famine, war, and pestilence, and have no way out of it but his.","But a deep grief fell on Siebenkæs, for men who rarely shed tears shed all the more when they do weep.",He begged her to put it on and let him see it on her--and he set it himself just as Madame von Blaise would wear it.,"Now the prize-lists--which are correct, seeing that they were made out by the secretary, under the eyes of the president, Herr von Blaise--state with distinctness that the head, the ring in the beak, and the little flag, fell into the hands of numbers 16, 2, and 63.","True, I should have to make my illustrative gestures under the warm water, because the only part of me out of my sheath would be my head (like the hilt of a dagger), with my master's cap on it.",[Footnote 24: For the next six pages or so the original literally _bristles_ with untranslatable puns and plays upon words.--Translator.],"Rosa knocked at Lenette's door, and straightway entered in at it, in order that she might not have a chance of coming and ascertaining who was there.","""No!","He said the same to the barber, and added that, of course, as hair goes on growing in the grave, the whole secret society (and fruit-bearing society) therein is adorned with fine beards, like Swiss of the age of sixty.","said Leibgeber; ""except, by the way, that I shan't go out now.",My sole object in making this observation is to point out that it did not apply to Lenette in any respect whatever.,"The reverse is the case in the palace; in a 'palais' for the 'palais' everybody's enjoyment goes into his mouth at the same instant; just as the little Aphides on the leaves all lift up their tail-ends, and squirt out the honey at the same moment,[12] in the palace it is absorbed with like simultaneousness and sociability.","People didn't like the idea of my going without something in the shape of a name--without some little vestige of Christianity of some kind--out of this world, which is a place whence we _do_ carry away even less than we bring into it with us.","The church-goers may sometimes, perhaps, be all the better for going so often; but it is for the sake of the unfortunate clergy who are obliged to preach so many times in one day, that they may think themselves lucky if all that happens to them is that they go to the devil and don't lose their voices into the bargain.","Clotilda said (not to us, but to her Luna)--(and here, dear Cato, I am drank with remembering; and I beg, accordingly, to invite you, at once, for the 10th of April), ""Ah!","I had seen absolutely nothing of the world, except this infernal gale.",Alas!,"As for Siebenkæs, he sat bolt-upright in purgatorial fire, already beginning to emit a smell of burning.","At the same time, a peace like this, brought about by a third party, is always something in the nature of a mere suspension of hostilities.",ii.,"And indeed, the Nature freak of counterpart faces is commoner than we suppose, because we only notice it when some prince or great person casts a corporeal reflection.","Then, beaming like some angel, she raised her face, worn with emotion to him, saying, ""All is over now; take the death kiss, and speak no more.""","Gone, so far as Lenette was concerned, were the tailor, the quarter-ell of chintz, the apple of discord, and the devil thereof; the blue of her eyes and the blush on her cheek fronted Stiefel as bright and as fresh as the blue of the evening sky and the blush on its sunset clouds.","With a whole iron foundry hammering in his breast, he made a long, noiseless stride into the room, which was all in apple-pie order, with its Sunday shirt of white sand on already (upon which the bed-making river goddess and water nymph had expended all her aquatic arts in the production, of a highly-finished masterpiece).","""Alas!","For Lenette, innocent as a child, believed it to be the bride's duty to give this kiss.","Gone, so far as Lenette was concerned, were the tailor, the quarter-ell of chintz, the apple of discord, and the devil thereof;
