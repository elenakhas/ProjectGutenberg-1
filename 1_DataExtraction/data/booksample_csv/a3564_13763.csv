laughed Netta.,"But, the question remained unanswered, ought she to stay?","The road was rough, and Monck slackened speed.","""I imagine so, but I really know very little.","""You can only help me by being patient--just at present,"" he said.",Let me take your Highness's cloak!,She would see for herself first.,I don't need to hear it.,"""Oh, I am not in the least nervous on my own account,"" she told him.","Can he have missed the way?""","He doesn't bite,"" she said.",In spite of herself she was moved by it.,"""Not if you are honest,"" he said.","He was bolting a hasty _tiffin_ in the dining-room when a quiet step on the verandah warned him of Bernard's approach, and in a moment or two the big man entered, a pipe in his mouth and a book under his arm.",He is undoubtedly clever.,She met the fierceness of his eyes unflinchingly.,"he said, his arms tightening about her.","Now, Captain Monck, will you be good enough to tell me how and where you spent that leave?",They'll be all right.,"Don't you realize how much better it would be for your own sake not to press me any further?""",he said.,With the return of health this resolution was forming within her.,Bernard said.,They went up into the bungalow.,"I knew it was only for mine, or of course I should have been furious.""",Everard did not look at him.,"The finger of suspicion has been pointed at the Rajah a good many times lately, and I do think that for Tessa's sake, if not for your own, you ought to put a check upon your intimacy with him.","Everard met the look, faintly smiling.",He appeared so seldom and then only by night.,"With the light tread often characteristic of heavy men, he approached it, realizing only at the last moment that it came from the window of his brother's room.","""All the same, Tessa can be a positive little demon when she likes.","And it was Everard who made the first move, turning from him as if he had ceased to count and pulling out a note-book that he always carried to make some entry.","Tessa sprang in after him, but pulled up sharply at sight of her mother.","She struggled to avoid them, but her strength was as a child's.","""It isn't,"" said Monck, with a brief smile.","If there isn't, well, I won't worry you, but you know you can count on me just the same.","Probably before that very night was over, he would have begun to gather the fruit of his ambition.","""What is it, darling?""","""Leave off crying!""","If you do, I shall shut up like a clam, and you may get pinched in the process.""","I must go round to the Club and get on the telephone at once.""","""Stella, in heaven's name, don't be afraid of me!""","""Now what exactly do you mean by a 'bust-up,' Mr.","""My dear child, what nonsense!""","I have lived years since I have been here, and I am glad of a rest.""","And--you won't feel like absolving me afterwards.""","CHAPTER VI THE SURPRISE PARTY Punctually at eight o'clock Tessa arrived, slightly awed but supremely happy, seated in a 'rickshaw, escorted by Bernard, and hugging the beloved Scooter to her eager little breast.","It seemed to Stella that she was more bent, more deliberate of movement, than usual.","Do you think Aunt Mary would mind if I stayed with you?""","""There was nothing official about it?""","I knew it was only for mine, or of course I should have been furious.""","""Oh--my God!""",We need to keep a very tight hold on faith.,What was that?,"""I never thought you noticed anything.""",I keep her safe by night as well as by day.,He kissed her on the lips.,But the veiled head bent over the child expressed nothing but complete docility.,"""You needn't be on mine,"" he said.","I'm all right now.""","It was an undignified position, and Tessa valued her dignity as a rule.","When next she stood upon that verandah, the ordeal she had begun to dread so needlessly, so unreasonably, would be over, and she would have emerged triumphant.","God knows, dear,--God knows that is all that matters now.",Everard turned and smote him on the shoulder.,No one does.,"On the second occasion she met her husband on the same errand and he drew her aside, his hand through her arm.","""Tea is ready, my _mem-sahib_"" said Peter softly behind her.",It was the only thing possible.,"He was a serpent underfoot, a knife in the dark, an evil dream.","You--you have far more beauty of soul than I have, or can ever hope to have now.""","""It was a mistake,"" she said.","""You--insist!""","During that time she had seen a good deal of her brother-in-law, who, nothing daunted by the discomforts of the journey, went to and fro several times between Bhulwana and the Plains.","If there yet remained unrest in the State, it was below the surface.","""That's as bad as telling you to pray for anything, isn't it?""",Tessa would need the utmost care.,"Now, don't be frightened!",He stood leaning slightly on the handle of the door.,"""What rot!","""That isn't the reason,"" he said.","It will keep her quiet.""",Afterwards she saw him no more.,"So far as I am concerned, it has cost a damned uncomfortable journey."
