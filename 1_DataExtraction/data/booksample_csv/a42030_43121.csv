he remained with them in Edinburgh, and, when his old playfellow's vigorous youth enabled him to rally up to a certain point, he arranged for the difficult journey south, and escorted them back to London.","""I don't think it was wrong as I was--at least for some people there does not seem anything very right.",They're very sociable and hospitable.,"""Did she?""","Thinking of you far away in   Ultima Thule, in the scenes of that dearest of books to my youth, _The   Pirate_, quite stirs my blood, and the Fitful Head and the Stones of   Stennis come vividly into my mind.","""I think you have every right to distrust me; but since you do, I will never marry you.","""I never thought of such a thing,"" said Amethyst, utterly thrown off her balance.",I am prepared to make a queen of you.,"Rather, she had hardly begun to grow, and within her were budding impulses, the nature of which she could not yet know.","he said, as he turned away.","It was a natural one.""",Every one's seen her.,"""I would give up everything on earth,"" said Amethyst.",said Lucian.,"Lucian lay motionless, and Sylvester looked round for any chance of help.","""But I can't do it, Carrie,"" said Charles, in his odd, half-shame-faced, half-rough voice.","He knew what no one else knew, enough to make him certain that there was some coil around the girl, who, three months before, had seemed the embodiment of fresh, frank youth, enough to make him doubtful how far the coil was of her own twisting.","""I'm glad I let go,"" murmured Lucian; while it came over Sylvester with a flash of certainty that the clasping hand had not given way from faintness, but had loosed its hold rather than risk pulling him over.","""What is it, Amethyst?",said another young man across the table.,"""Oh, I am sick of lovers,"" she said angrily.","Oh, I could keep school, I always liked teaching.","I meant her to have such a success in London.""",MARSHALLING THE COMPANY.,"""If it's not too much for you, I will try.""",In the meantime Amethyst had not long remained crying in Una's arms.,"Then we'll remember to-day.""","Looks like a new beginning.""","It was, really, to this humiliating need, rather than to any misapprehension or dread of discovery, that Amethyst's fate was owing.","Amethyst, the feel of that Presence is as real to me, as the feel of your arms round me when I am tired and miserable--as real, and even better.","""Does Grattan stick to Amethyst?""","She heard his voice now--""I would rather see you die than do it.""",Amethyst was standing under a chandelier; she had the faculty of being able to stand perfectly still.,"Lady Haredale did not dress too youthfully, or try to keep her beautiful daughter in the background; on the contrary, everything was arranged to make a good time for Amethyst; Lady Haredale chose her dresses with the utmost care, and taught her how to arrange them becomingly, with so outspoken a delight in the girl's beauty as almost rendered her flattery harmless.","She encouraged Una, and would not let her dwell on what Tory called ""the family crisis,"" but she was a little surprised that the two younger ones also were evidently uncomfortable, and made a point of going down-stairs under her protection.","""I think you must know why I have come, Amethyst,"" said Mrs Leigh, who was too sincere a person, and in too nervous a mood, to fence.",She ran away as she spoke.,"""There is a picture by Titian, as you call him, in my house in Rome,"" said Prince Pontresina in delicate careful English, ""which was painted for my ancestor by the master himself, and we possess his receipt for the money that was paid to him.""","said Una, after a moment's startled silence.","Amethyst wouldn't like that.""",BETTER.,"The acquaintance with the Leighs was of recent date, and Lucian's past history was evidently unknown.","and she flung herself down on her bed, sobbing pitifully.","I think, perhaps, I shall write to Miss Halliday and consult her, though I would rather teach in a High School than go back to Saint Etheldred's.","""I have come down for a few hours on business for my mother, and I came to see Miss Riddell.","She looks well, and has not lost her sweet manner, but her girlishness has all gone, and she is more the grand lady than her mother.""","""I can't marry you, my dear, as you'd see, if I could tell you anything about it, or if you could understand, which you couldn't--please God you never will.","There's trouble ahead, though you might not think it.""","She has never been with Lady Haredale.""","Lucian could not fail to see that this speech was intended to offend him, and, taken in conjunction with Lady Haredale's previous excuses, that it was intended to conceal the truth.","""But that wouldn't have made any difference.""",Let us go back.,"and suppose my lord says no?""","But I couldn't stand the thought that you might be still bound in heart to a fellow who had had scruples about you, who cared one iota to know what you had _done_--when he knew _you_.","""Thank you for bringing it to me,"" he said, and put it in his breast-pocket.","""What does it mean?""","""You like the woods?""",I'm glad now it was all my fault and not hers.,"""My ridiculous hair,"" said Una, pulling it through her fingers, and lingering a little on the epithet.","""Would mother let you?""","But, on the other hand, we're as poor as rats, as you know;
