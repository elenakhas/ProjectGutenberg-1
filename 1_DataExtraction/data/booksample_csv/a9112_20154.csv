"If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.",Arcot had chosen to give this demonstration with definite reason.,"""Think so.","All climbed swiftly, gaining ever more rapidly.",A piece of perhaps half a ton mass.,"""Eventually, we did the job.","There are, no doubt, other worlds of this Universe here that we do not know of that have felt the vengeance of Thett, and if we can cause such trouble to them by destroying these worlds, and putting the fear of our attacking their mother world into them, they will call off those other fleets.",The disc dissolved.,"""First, though, gentlemen, allow me to introduce Stel Felso Theu of the planet Talso, one of our allies in this struggle, and Zezdon Afthen and Fentes of Ortol, one of our other allies.",Installed in the _Thought_ with the _Banderlog_'s controls.,Arcot pointed out the spot in Vermont where their private lake and laboratory were.,"""You created matter.","I know my wives have never had the jealous quarrels I see in your mind pictures.""","It is not natural, and can exist only where it is made and nowhere else--obvious, but important.","It may be drained back into power coils such as ours for instance, or one might just spend that last iota of power on the job.",Morey rose and went to the door that led through the main passage to the galley.,asked Sthanto smoothly.,"""There they are--whatever they are.","There were two time-fields, overlapping time-fields.",Then suddenly the performance was over.,"Finally we captured two Venonians who had seen it, and attempted to force the information we needed from them.",This is one of the planetary blocks.,Immediately Arcot set to work.,A party of men of Talso met the terrestrians outside the ship.,"They had entered a large stone building, into which led numerous very heavy silver wires.","""Now here is where we give them something to think about.","""But the reason why it would blow up so was obvious.","The strangers advanced with a swift, light step, jumping from rock to rock, while Morey and Afthen flew part way toward them.","I'm going down now to give them a nice little dose,"" said Arcot grimly.","The other fort was near now, and started an attack of its own.","Arcot, protected in space, was thinking swiftly.","Only the leaders appeared to be in good physical condition, and the men could not develop to large stature.","The second hand joined the first, and fell to work on the bar, and pulled.","""They might take us for enemies--which wouldn't be so good.""","""Old Sthanto is much too confident, I believe,"" said an assistant working at one of the great boards in the enemy's fort, to one of his friends.",Ray screens were circular and the city was protected by dozens of stations.,Small stars do not bother us as I will explain.,One favorite seemed to be a large club.,"""Guess it will work,"" said Arcot with a grin.","We have been coasting through time on retarded rate while Earth caught up with itself, so to speak.","Immediately great artificial matter tools gripped the broken nose-section, clamped it into place, and welded it with cosmium flowing under the inconceivable pressure till it was again a single great hull.","""Arcot,"" he called.","Let them come to the appointment, while we do some work, and we have plenty of work to do, I assure you.","""We saw them investigate the planet.",Arcot spoke sharply--a new plan had occurred to him.,Then the molecular power was shut off.,"At once they returned to normal space, and darted down toward the now distant planet.","Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.","What was that?""","Lux metal he did not make, but relux, the infusible, perfect conductor, and cosmium in tremendous masses, he did make.","""If a current cuts across a magnetic field, a side thrust is developed.","I think that it would be wiser to investigate the power lines at once,"" suggested Morey.","""They all followed the same tactics on landing, so I'll simply tell what happened in Attica.","We must be ten thousand light years beyond the galaxy.""","But the men were still active, and rapidly spreading from the spot, each protected by a ray shield pack.","Chapter XX DESTRUCTION Some time later, Arcot spoke.",They seem tremendously afraid of that apparatus of yours.,"Lights were showing in the few windows the huge bulk had, and lights showed now in the buildings on the shore.","A normal field is necessarily attached to the matter that it represents, or that represents it as you prefer, but this artificial field has no connection in the form of matter.","Then the artificial matter contracted swiftly, compressing the matter, and simultaneously treating it with the tremendous fields that changed its energy form.","He went again into space, and retreated.",Arcot watched them.,"""But on the other hand, the gravity-beam pulls with a constant force.","Space suits, and rush all the apparatus out,"" snapped Arcot.","Frantically the Thessians tried weapon after weapon, and found them dead almost as soon as they were turned on--which was the natural result in the terrific magnetic field.","They begged my pardon for letting loose such a menace, quite sincerely feeling that it was their fault.","Then the terrestrian turned on the power, and gradually increased it until the power authorities were afraid of breakdowns.","Another took a piece of the relux from the broken Thessian ship, pushed it into the hole on the ship.","Frantically the Thessians tried weapon after weapon, and found them dead almost as soon as they were turned on--which was the natural result in the terrific magnetic field.",Most of the energy escaped into space.,"That law operates in the case of the pulled body; it pulls the gravitational field as a normal field, the inverse-square law applying.","If the artificial matter would only fight it, I'd be all right.""","""I hope they use good stuff,"" grinned Arcot.",The giant tamper set to work.,"In ranks, rows, and columns they were piled into a great block, for power must be stored for use of this tremendous machine, while in the artificial space when its normal power was not available, and that power source must be tremendous.",demanded the Talsonian.,"""We finally found a combination of rays, better frequencies, that did what we wanted.",exclaimed Wade.,"""What's the secret?""","Morey explained: ""It is very soft, for its atom is so large that it is soft in the molecular state.","A last awful thing--a thing they had not noticed as all eyes watched that Thing--was standing by the rent in the Sphere now, the gigantic Thessian, with leering, bestial jaws, enormous, squat limbs, the webbed fingers and toes, and the heavy torso of his race, grinning at them.","""I didn't expect to come out alive from that battleship there.","The ovaloid ship which drifted so slowly toward them suddenly seemed to jerk, and from it reached pseudopods!"
