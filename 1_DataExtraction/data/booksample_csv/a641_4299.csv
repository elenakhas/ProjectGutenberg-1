Alma won't let you go.',Boldness was necessary--far more boldness than she had yet dared to use.,"Look here--it was a toss-up whether I should let you go or not, until you said _that_.","Mr. Wigram, one of her father's co-directors, was lying at this moment in durance vile, and his wife lived somewhere or other on charity.","With this comforting assurance, Felix Dymes departed.","As you have two tongues, you naturally have two names--probably more.","'Perhaps because you yourself represent civilisation in its subtlest phase, and when I am with you I naturally think only of that.",'I know nothing about that.,"Yet more than ever she hoped to meet Redgrave, to hold him by a new link of illusory temptation, that he might exert himself to the utmost in promoting her success.",Mrs. Maskell smiled and shook her head.,"After all, you know, I'm one of the men that people talk about; my name has got into the ""directories of talent"", as somebody calls them; and I have a good deal at stake.","She had seen the little girl, but only once, and without attention.",I'm quite sure we can be friends.,"He's a hard-working man, and the children aren't very healthy, and I'm sure I don't know how he'd manage----' 'You have no choice, Ruth, I see.",Carnaby experienced a profound relief.,'It was Sibyl forced me to tell the truth.,No wonder the matter had been kept so quiet.,"You are not the ordinary girl, and you won't imagine that I feared for you; I know you too well.",On her table stood the little vial with its draught of oblivion.,"Harvey's ear detected movements without, but no one entered; in a minute or two, he again breathed freely.","As he did not answer, she half turned towards him.","'It depends what you mean by ""here"".",Women who wanted to be thought smart had quite altered their tone about her.,"'Hughie, you know, is three years old.","Yet it could not relieve Alma from the fear of her, and of Hugh Carnaby himself--fear which must last a lifetime; which at any moment, perhaps long years hence, might find its bitter fulfilment, and work her ruin.",'Why?',she asked.,'I understand.,But Harvey had a troublesome conscience.,"It appeared odd at the time, and was more difficult to understand the more she thought of it.","If she must remain in uncertainty about his attitude towards her, the approaching ordeal would be intensified with a new agitation: was he coming to her recital, or was he not?","No melodrama; a hand-grip, a significant nod, a loud humming as he went downstairs.","She knew Sibyl, and could follow the workings of her mind: a woman incapable of love, or of the passion which simulates it; worshipping herself, offering luxuries to her cold flesh as to an idol; scornful of the possibility that she might ever come to lack what she desired; and, at the critical moment, prompt to secure herself against such danger by the smiling, cynical acceptance of whatsoever shame.",At fifteen they'll take him on a training ship.--I wonder whether their father's alive or dead?',"Unless--unless Sibyl, for some reason, preferred to send the message more privately?",I wasn't a penniless adventurer.,"Unless it were a tremor of the eyelids, no movement betrayed itself in Sibyl's features; yet their expression had grown cold, and seemed upon the verge of a disdainful wonder.","'I hope I neither scowled nor snarled, dear boy, though I'm not sure that _you_ didn't.","That their dresses cost a great deal, was taken as a matter of course; also that they should go abroad when other people did, and have the best places at concert or theatre, and be expansively 'at home'.",He raised her head gently.,"Now I'm so far, I might as well go on into Italy, and make a round of it.","Well, he could say, with entire honesty, that he had over nine hundred pounds a year.","'Why didn't you give your friends tea, dear?'","Alma began to talk eagerly, joyously.",'What do you mean by that?',"She awaited him in the drawing-room, alone.",'Oh no!,"I know people at Leipzig--the Gassners, you remember.",On an appointed day the ladies paid him a visit at his rooms.,'The little ones--yes.,"The art student had acquaintances in Munich, but did not see much of them, and they were not the kind of people with whom Alma cared to associate.","You have discussed it with her, haven't you?'","he asked, after a pause.","'Well now, let _me_ put the whole matter into plainer words than I have liked to use.'","No sooner had he entered than he overcame all restraint, all misgiving; there was nothing here today but peace and good feeling, gentle voices and quiet amiability.","'Well, I'm sorry.","When they started, Alma came out to the garden gate, and dismissed them with smiling benignity; one might have expected her to say 'Be good!'","Turning presently to glance at Alma, he saw that she had not stirred, and when he leaned towards her, the sound of her breathing told him that she was asleep.","Harvey was in excellent spirits, though time hung rather heavily on his hands.","There came into the lamplight a rather tall figure in plain, serviceable travelling-costume.","'I've no doubt you could play it wonderfully--as you would ""Three Blind Mice"".'","When Mrs. Frothingham went upstairs with the letter for Alma, he broke open another envelope.","'I would at once,' Harvey replied, with hesitation, 'if I felt sure that----' He broke off, and altered the turn of his sentence.",Mrs. Larkfield is simply intolerable.,"A fellow about town somehow got hold of an idea for a melody; he didn't know a note, but he whistled it to Sykes, and Sykes dotted it down.",By the evening's post on the following day he was surprised to receive a letter addressed in Alma's unmistakable hand.,'Of course.,"'Oh, then I can give you all the news; I had a letter yesterday.",'Perhaps so.','You know me too well--you know I couldn't--say you believe me!,'Friends in _that_ sense?,'What does it mean?','You have the first offer?',It seems a month ago.,"I am glad to say that I have been able to help a little here and there, but only the kind of people whom it's easy to help.","But Hughie has a cold tonight; caught mine, I dare say, confound it!",'Oh come!,'So unfortunate!,"asked Alma, pointing to a volume on a table near her.",I'm thinking of it seriously.,"'I can't go to your rooms,' said Alma, after a useless resistance.","I promise not to speak of it again until, on coming into the room, I see your atlas lying open on the table; that shall be a sign unto me.'","she asked, remarking his appearance."
