and that the shorter, simpler and more general this verbal formula, the more effective it will be.","For we shall not be able to make order, in any hopeful sense, of the tangle of material which is before us, until we have subdued it to this ruling thought: seen one transcendent Object towards which all our twisting pathways run, and one impulsion pressing us towards it.","Thought and action on highest levels are involved in it, for it means, not religious emotionalism, but the unflickering orientation of the whole self towards Him, ever seeking and finding the Eternal; the linking up of all behaviour on that string, so that the apparently hard and always heroic choices which are demanded, are made at last because they are inevitable.","This stimulus and this education, in normal cases, are given by tradition;

and the possibility of tapping its resources, bending its plastic shape to our own mould.","[Footnote 101: William Penn: ""No Cross, No Crown.""]","These souls, living it is true with intensity their own life towards God, share and are bathed in the group consciousness of their church;

and instinctively obedient to the mystic command to sink into the ground of the soul, he leans towards those deep wells of his own being which plunge into the unconscious foundations of life.","Indeed, all who are not thorough-going materialists must regard the study of the spiritual life as in the truest sense a department of biology; and any account of man which fails to describe it, as incomplete.","Far better that our primitive emotions, with their vast store of potential energy, should be won for spiritual interests on the only terms which they can grasp, than that they should be left to spend themselves on lower objects.","Their business is rather to give us poetry, a concrete artistic intuition of reality, and to place us in the mood of poetry.",[Footnote 113: Op.,"The teacher has to reckon with this funded energy and enthusiasm, and use it to further the highest interests of the growing child.","It suggests--and here, more and more, psychology supports it--that, real and alive as we are in relation to this system with which we find ourselves in correspondence, yet we are not so real, nor so alive, as it is possible to be.","consider it well, and know that this is your own country.",29.],"[Footnote 50: Baron von Huegel In the ""Hibbert Journal,"" July, 1921.]",Thus St. Paul hides himself in Arabia;
