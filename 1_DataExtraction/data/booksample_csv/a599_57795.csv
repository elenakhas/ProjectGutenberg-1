It is not merely Humours: for neither Volpone nor Mosca is a humour.,"This thing undreamed of, sudden from on high,     Hath sapped my soul: I dazzle where I stand,     The cup of all life shattered in my hand.... Again, we find that the Greek is:     ἐμοὶ δ’ ἄελπτον πρᾶγμα προσπεσὸν τόδε     ψυχὴν διέφθαρκ᾽· οἴχομαι δὲ καὶ βίου     χάριν μεθεῖσα κατθανεῖν χρηῄζω, φίλαι.","Coleridge’s remarks—too few and scattered—have permanent truth; but on some of the greatest names he passes no remark, and of some of the best plays was perhaps ignorant or ill-informed.","The sound is _forc’d_, the notes are few!",He has no dissociative faculty.,"Such men as Tylor, and Robertson Smith, and Wilhelm Wundt, who early fertilized the soil, would hardly recognize the resulting vegetation; and indeed poor Wundt’s _Völkerpsychologie_ was a musty relic before it was translated.","The ruling faculty is a critical perception, a commentary upon experienced feeling and sensation.","The performer is interested not in form but in opportunities for virtuosity or in the communication of his “personality”; the formlessness, the lack of intellectual clarity and distinction in modern music, the great physical stamina and physical training which it often requires, are perhaps signs of the triumph of the performer.",This form was the Heroic Drama.,"It is obvious that the spring of the difference is not the difference between feeling and thought, or superior insight, superior perception, on the part of Shakespeare, but his susceptibility to a greater range of emotion, and emotion deeper and more obscure.","“The beauty of Swinburne’s verse is the sound,” people say, explaining, “he had little visual imagination.” I am inclined to think that the word “beauty” is hardly to be used in connection with Swinburne’s verse at all; but in any case the beauty or effect of sound is neither that of music nor that of poetry which can be set to music.","(Tennyson, _Dora_) In _Faustus_ Marlowe went farther: he broke up the line, to a gain in intensity, in the last soliloquy; and he developed a new and important conversational tone in the dialogues of Faustus with the devil.","He has an idea (a feeling, an image), he develops it by accretion or expansion, alters his verse often, and hesitates often over the final choice.","Turning then to the induction of _The Poetaster_, we find another success of the same kind—     Light, I salute thee, but with wounded nerves.... Men may not talk in that way, but the spirit of envy does, and in the words of Jonson envy is a real and living person.",It is also the realization of the whole appropriate content of this rhyme or rhythm.,"That it is not “rhetoric,” or at least not vicious rhetoric, we do not know until we are able to review the whole play.","32):     Like to an almond tree y-mounted high       On top of green Selinis all alone,     With blossoms brave bedeckèd daintily;       Whose tender locks do tremble every one     At every little breath that under heaven is blown.","The undigested “idea” or philosophy, the idea-emotion, is to be found also in poetic dramas which are conscientious attempts to adapt a true structure, Athenian or Elizabethan, to contemporary feeling.","One is in risk of becoming fatigued by a hubbub that does not march; the drum is beaten, but the procession does not advance.","Falstaff is not only the roast Malmesbury ox with the pudding in his belly; he also “grows old,” and, finally, his nose is as sharp as a pen.","The author of Swinburne’s critical essays is also the author of Swinburne’s verse: if you hold the opinion that Swinburne was a very great poet, you can hardly deny him the title of a great critic.","For one thing, the stage appeals to too many demands besides the demand for art for that to be possible; and also we need, unfortunately, something more than refined automatons.","But in Swinburne there is no _pure_ beauty—no pure beauty of sound, or of image, or of idea.","We begin vaguely with good taste, by a recognition that Massinger is inferior: can we trace this inferiority, dissolve it, and have left any element of merit?","Massinger had not the personality to create great farce, and he was too serious to invent trivial farce.","You can, in fact, put together heterogeneous parts to form a lively play; but a character, to be living, must be conceived from some emotional unity.","It had serious defects, even gross faults, but we cannot be considered to have erased them from our language when we are so unclear in our perception of what they are.",And Arnold lacked the active resistance which is necessary to keep a mind at its sharpest.,"A combination of non-critical, rather than uncritical, qualities made Mr. Whibley the most appropriate person in the world for the work by which he is best known.","Poetry of the surface cannot be understood without study; for to deal with the surface of life, as Jonson dealt with it, is to deal so deliberately that we too must be deliberate, in order to understand.","Massinger’s great comic rogues, Sir Giles Overreach and Luke Frugal, are members of the large English family which includes Barabas and Sir Epicure Mammon, and from which Sir Tunbelly Clumsy claims descent.",When Massinger’s ladies resist temptation they do not appear to undergo any important emotion; they merely know what is expected of them; they manifest themselves to us as lubricious prudes.,"By comparing the whole speech with Clarence’s dream, in _Richard III._, one acquires a little insight into the difference between Marlowe and Shakespeare:                          What scourge for perjury     Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?",Sensation became word and the word was sensation.,"There is a brutality, a lack of sentiment, a polished surface, a handling of large bold designs in brilliant colours, which ought to attract about three thousand people in London and elsewhere.","Jonson had his own scale, his own instrument.","In fact, the bad poet is usually unconscious where he ought to be conscious, and conscious where he ought to be unconscious.","_Cyrano_ satisfies, as far as scenes like this can satisfy, the requirements of poetic drama.","The words themselves are mostly simple words, the syntax is natural, the language austere rather than adorned.","In the nineteenth century another mentality manifested itself It is evident in a very able and brilliant poem, Goethe’s _Faust_.","But Swinburne ought to suggest or imply (I do not say impose) a reason for reading the _Sparagus Garden_ or the _Antipodes_, more sufficient than any he has provided.",His two comedies therefore occupy a place by themselves.,"The reasons for raising the question again are first that the majority, perhaps, certainly a large number, of poets hanker for the stage; and second, that a not negligible public appears to want verse plays.",This meddling with nature seldom succeeds; nature usually overcomes these obstacles.,"If you compare several representative passages of the greatest poetry you see how great is the variety of types of combination, and also how completely any semi-ethical criterion of “sublimity” misses the mark.",But in analysing the maladies of the second-rate or corrupt literature of the time he makes the labour of the creative artist lighter.,"Tennyson, who might unquestionably have been a consummate master of minor forms, took to turning out large patterns on a machine.","His particular emotions may be simple, or crude, or flat.","As an artisan of the theatre he is not inferior to Fletcher, and his best tragedies have an honester unity than _Bonduca_.",And we realize better how different—not how much more Olympian—were the conditions of the Greek civilization from ours; and at the same time Mr. Zimmern has shown us how the Greek dealt with analogous problems.,"The romance of the ancient world becomes more romantic in the idiomatic prose of North; the heroes are not merely Greek and Roman heroes, but Elizabethan heroes as well; the romantic fusion allured Wyndham.","To declare himself, therefore, is impossible.","Tradition and the Individual Talent                                    I In English writing we seldom speak of tradition, though we occasionally apply its name in deploring its absence.","But this slightness is part of the nature of the art which Jonson practised, a smaller art than Shakespeare’s.","A number of sciences have sprung up in an almost tropical exuberance which undoubtedly excites our admiration, and the garden, not unnaturally, has come to resemble a jungle.","In a few opening words Plato gives a scene, a personality, a feeling, which colour the subsequent discourse but do not interfere with it: the particular setting, and the abstruse theory of knowledge afterwards developed, co-operate without confusion.","For Tragedy is an imitation, not of men, but of an action and of life, and life consists in action, and its end is a mode of action, not a quality.”[6] Footnote 6:   _Poetics_, vi.",And it is because this elementary virtue is so rare that Swinburne must take a very respectable place as a critic.,"I say farce, but with the enfeebled humour of our times the word is a misnomer; it is the farce of the old English humour, the terribly serious, even savage comic humour, the humour which spent its last breath on the decadent genius of Dickens.","There is a trace of it only in Keats, and, derived from a different source, in Rossetti.","What we get in Swinburne is an expression by sound, which could not possibly associate itself with music.",The scene between Fulvia and Galla and Sempronia is a living scene in a wilderness of oratory.,"To attempt to do so would in the first place be unfair, as the book is a posthumous work, and posthumous books demand some personal attention to their writers.","Or as their ruin the large Tyber fills,     Make that swell up, and drown thy seven proud hills?...","Mr. Robertson points out, very pertinently, how critics have failed in their “interpretation” of _Hamlet_ by ignoring what ought to be very obvious: that _Hamlet_ is a stratification, that it represents the efforts of a series of men, each making what he could out of the work of his predecessors.","_Shakespeare_: God knows, my son,              By what by-paths and indirect crook’d ways              I met this crown.","To conform merely would be for the new work not really to conform at all; it would not be new, and would therefore not be a work of art.",His diffuseness is one of his glories.,Mr. Paul More is the author of a number of volumes which he perhaps hopes will break the record of mass established by the complete works of Sainte-Beuve.,"The poem _Whether on Ida’s shady brow_ is eighteenth-century work; the movement, the weight of it, the syntax, the choice of words—     The _languid_ strings do scarcely move!","Fletcher and Massinger rendered it ridiculous; not by not believing in it, but because they were men of great talents who could not vivify it; because they could not fit into it passionate, complete human characters.","Mr. Cruickshank’s book is a work of scholarship; and the advantage of good scholarship is that it presents us with evidence which is an invitation to the critical faculty of the reader: it bestows a method, rather than a judgment.","Wyndham was enthusiastic, he was a Romantic, he was an Imperialist, and he was quite naturally a literary pupil of W. E. Henley.",And this leads to another reason for the incompetence of our time in poetic drama.,"I mean this as a principle of aesthetic, not merely historical, criticism.",It is indestructible.,And the suspicion is in our breast that Mr. Whibley might admire George Meredith.,For Wyndham is himself a period and a tradition.,The lines in Act V. sc.,"Even when we come across lines like:     There’s a plumber laying pipes in my guts, it scalds, we must not allow ourselves to forget the rhetorical basis any more than when we read:     Come, let us march against the powers of heaven     And set black streamers in the firmament     To signify the slaughter of the gods.","Without concerning himself with the character of Sulla, and in lines of invective, Jonson makes Sylla’s ghost, while the words are spoken, a living and terrible force.","Any age has its conventions; and any age might appear absurd when its conventions get into the hands of a man like Massinger—a man, we mean, of so exceptionally superior a literary talent as Massinger’s, and so paltry an imagination.","And Hamlet the character has had an especial temptation for that most dangerous type of critic: the critic with a mind which is naturally of the creative order, but which through some weakness in creative power exercises itself in criticism instead."
