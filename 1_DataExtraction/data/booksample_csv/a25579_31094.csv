"He didn't think you were the man, he didn't trust you--thought you had been raised too strongly on the sort of gibberish you were writing.","Don't know who it was, but he sounded mighty agitated.""","""Not me,"" said Shandor flatly, standing up.","He moved south over open country, hoping to avoid the places where the 'copter might be spotted and stopped for questioning.","Shandor frowned, a snag in the chain drawing his attention.",Only a monster could have done what you're thinking.,"This story is going to press straight and true, every word of it.","Frank Mariel looked like a weasel--sallow, sunken-cheeked, with a yellowish cast to his skin that contrasted unpleasantly with the coal black hair.","""It doesn't make sense.","They must realize that the first ship was the hardest, that the trap is sprung.","The cold, metallic voice of the automatic chirped twice and said, ""Your reference, pleeyuz.""",_I want those files._ Because when I have them I'm going to do exactly what I started out to do.,"Now _get that story in_.""","He followed it, quickly checking a topographical map in the cockpit, and his heart started pounding.","Easing the ship into the sky toward Washington, he searched out a news report on the radio, listened with a dull feeling in the pit of his stomach as the story came through about the breakdown of the Berlin Conference, the declaration of war, the President's meeting with Congress that morning, his formal request for full wartime power, the granting of permission by a wide-eyed, frightened legislature.","""Harry Dartmouth told me--"" ""And who told Harry Dartmouth?""","Mariel handled propaganda through the newspapers, and PIB, and magazines--a clever man--and Harry Dartmouth handled production.","""Ben Chamberlain wrote for every large circulation magazine in the country, after the Chinese war.","A female voice, quite human, spoke as he lifted the receiver.","""It's not very impressive.""",They picked up a whole ring that's been operating for over a year.,"Hart scowled at him, his round face red and annoyed.","""What--what are you going to do?""","For all her lovely face there was an edge of thin ice to her smile, a razor-sharp, dangerous quality that made him curiously uncomfortable.",Hart scowled.,"I had to come here, to make sure the war doesn't go on any longer than necessary.""","But first people must be sold on space, from the bottom up.","You're going to tell me where Harry Dartmouth went with those files, where they are right now.",He knew only one way to get them.,"He believed that if the people of the world had a cause, a purpose, a driving force, that there wouldn't be any more wars.",Shandor eyed the door uneasily.,"I can see how you worked it, how you engineered it, but this--"" he gestured feebly at the window, at the black, impossible landscape outside.",Finally he read it again.,"Everything was quiet, orderly.","Staring, he dived into the pile of papers again, searching, frantically searching for the missing piece, something he had seen, and passed over, the one single piece in the story that didn't make sense.","""I've learned things in the past twenty-four hours I never dreamed could be true.","Her voice was small, infinitely frightened.","Shandor sat up, shaking as the chill in the room became painfully evident.","I want his number.""","They just won't be doing anything at all.""","I should be able to believe anything, I suppose, but these things knocked my stilts out from under me.",Not manganese.,"Mile upon mile of jagged, rocky crags, black rock, ageless, unaged rock.",His eyes looked up in dull anger.,"Born 1922, married 1947.","And he stared at the small figure standing at the door, a stoop-shouldered man, white hair slightly untidy, crow's-feet about his tired eyes.","In a moment he heard a receiver click off, and a familiar voice said, ""Prex speaking.""","""Why the secrecy?""","You could write it, and you'd be out of a job so fast you wouldn't know what hit you.","""She knew about it all the time?""","If you want to play games, I can play games too.",There was only one more frontier they could reach for.,"Where are you?""","""What do you want?""","""Sure, I've got an idea.","He was carrying his lily-livered pacifism right to the White House, and I couldn't see it.","""Would you say that they were enemies?""","Suddenly the 'copter radio bleeped, and Tom threw the switch.","A war of intolerance, of unmixable ideas--"" The old man paused, and drew a sip of water from the canister in the corner.",And we aimed at a controlled war.,"Should I tell them they aren't really being bombed, it's all in their minds?","Current plans say that he gets pneumonia tomorrow, and goes to Walter Reed tomorrow night.","It's horrible, I know.","""And where are the files now?""","""Let's let it ride for a moment.",Prex shrugged.,"""Munitions people, mostly.","""Listen, Mariel.","He told me that--oh, a year ago.","""But you'll have to read it in the newspapers.""","Mariel had known where he would be, and at what time.",He heard Dr. Prex's sharp voice on the wire.,He had some information that he planned to drop on the conference table with such a bang it would stop the whole world cold.,"Things happened so fast, and I was so confused--"" She looked straight at him.","""Look, I don't know what Dartmouth Bearing had in mind.","They pushed for everything they could get, and they had the money, the power, the men to do whatever they wanted.","Except for one or two items it's all staff-written.""","He shook his head angrily, trying to keep his thoughts on a rational plane.","""I know your writing, Mr. Shandor.","""Any particular thorns in his side?""","""Harry Dartmouth has the files,"" he groaned.",Space.,"""That's very odd,"" he said softly."
