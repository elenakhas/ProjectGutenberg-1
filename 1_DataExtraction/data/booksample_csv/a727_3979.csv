He opened the widow.,So the world still existed!,"While one is young and strong as we are, such cowardly conduct is not permissible.","""No.","If she herself should ask for anything, you will give her what she needs.","The words, spoken coldly, without anger, fell heavily upon Fromont's bewildered joy, and reminded him of the gravity of a situation which he was always on the point of forgetting.","""Is it you, Monsieur Planus?""",It is all over.,"Georges was deeply moved, humiliated, pale as death.",But those six months will be very hard to live through.,Risler assented to the suggestion; he had not tasted beer for six months.,I never shall return home.,Risler shook his head.,"Such was the scene lighted by the modest little lamp which Risler had seen from below, like a star fallen from the radiant chandeliers of the ballroom.",The strolling actress!,Risler turned upon him indignantly.,Then we'll go to the house together.,"Free--I am free!""",the people shouted.,"She was driven from her house, stripped, dishonored.",Risler never walked through the shops without a feeling of pleasure.,"Risler pretended not to look at him, and continued to pace the floor as he talked: ""Our house is passing through a terrible crisis.",queried the old lady from behind the door.,"""Your wife?","""Very well,"" she said; ""say that he will come.""","""Why?","And he pointed to the great windows of the salon of Cafe Vefour, gleaming in the rays of the setting sun like the chandeliers at a wedding feast.","An iron hand, falling upon her, aroused her abruptly from her torpor.","There was a terrible pause, during which they heard the muffled music of the orchestra upstairs and the noise of the ball, the dull, wearing noise of floors shaken by the rhythmic movement of the dance.","Claire Fromont, standing in the doorway, would smile as she looked at them.","The old cashier was still at work, at one o'clock in the morning!","Consider that, mingled with all these perplexities in his mind, was the superstitious reverence of the common people for holy days, for the twenty-four hours of rest, wherein one recovers strength and courage.","""Oh!","It keeps me from thinking.""","Of how many ups and downs was her new, unforeseen, and whimsical existence to consist?",Risler understood her and smiled in superb disdain.,"he said, after a pause.","She had run quickly to him, and that brief scene had in no wise disturbed the guests, then at the height of the evening's enjoyment.","The old cashier had gone out to luncheon, leaving the key in his drawer, a most extraordinary thing.","""Oh!","Reassured by Pere Achille's reply, the honest fellow thought of going up to his bedroom, avoiding the festivities and the guests, for whom he cared little.","The open doors, the rugs lying in heaps in the corners, the salvers laden with glasses, the preparations for the supper, the table still set and untouched, the dust from the dancing on all the furniture, its odor mingled with the fumes of punch, of withered flowers, of rice- powder--all these details attracted Risler's notice as he entered.","Did any one come from the Bank?""","no, indeed!",Soon four Risler Presses were definitively set up and used in the work of the factory.,And the smile of former days played about the corners of her pale lips.,"The latter, somewhat abashed, hesitated a moment; then, impelled by one of those secret springs which we have within us and which guide us, despite ourselves, in the path of our destiny, he walked straight to the cashier's grating.","""Forget?",What had they done downstairs?,"He said it without enthusiasm, hopelessly, with the satisfaction of a task accomplished, and nothing more.",The wretched man heard nothing.,He never would give up!,They were obliged to resume their seats.,"Then, suddenly, shame and disgust seized upon him and he rushed from the hall, overturning chairs and tables, pursued by the terror and imprecations of all those scandalized bourgeois.","That determination must have been very powerful; for while his temples throbbed madly, hammered by the blood that turned his face purple, while his ears were ringing and his glazed eyes seemed already turned toward the terrible unknown, the unhappy man muttered to himself in a thick voice, like the voice of a shipwrecked man speaking with his mouth full of water in a howling gale: ""I must live!","What?""","Indeed, they have become extremely negligent and indifferent.",Risler pretended not to hear him.,"The blaring brass brings out in bold relief the mild warmth of the closing hours of those summer days, so long and enervating in Paris; it seems as if one could hear nothing else.","Forgive me for having suspected you.""",Madame Fromont was informed at once.,"Then the music ceased, the garden became deserted.",The fact was that when his child was once in the gutter he ran great risk of not having a feather bed to sleep on himself.,"He glanced at the crowd from time to time with a patronizing air: but his eyes were most frequently turned toward the platform, with encouraging little gestures and smiles and pretended applause, addressed to some one whom Pere Planus could not see from his seat.","The young woman's first thought was to join the tenor Cazaboni, whom at the last she had not dared to invite to her ball; but he lived at Montmartre, and that was very far away for her to go, in that garb; and then, would he be at home?","""I should think so!""",She could hardly restrain an exclamation of pity; but the grave taciturnity of the two men told her that she must be silent.,"""I will do whatever you wish.""",his own interest was at stake in the matter.,no--I mean three years ago.,The letter and package are at my house at Montrouge.,"""Why do you refuse to take my hand?""","""Monsieur Georges sick?""",Do you suppose I am going to let you drive my child into the street.,"""Is she in Paris?""","Although it was still early, the place was full; and even before entering one had a feeling of suffocation, simply from seeing the crowds of people sitting around the tables, and at the farther end, half-hidden by the rows of pillars, a group of white-robed women on a raised platform, in the heat and glare of the gas.",Up-stairs they were still dancing.,"""Leave me--go away,"" he said to Sigismond.","So he walked through the many-windowed workshops, which the moon, reflected by the snow, made as light as at noonday.",They don't make spectacles of themselves as you've been doing ever since morning.,This is what had happened.,"For the moment a proud smile relaxed his prematurely old, gloomy features.","He has also sold their house at Asnieres with all it contained;
