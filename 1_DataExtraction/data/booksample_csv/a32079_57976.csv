"Billy, as he ran across the room, could see over the stranger’s shoulder, down between the trees to the creek and the high rocks at the edge of the little harbour.","The thing directly before her was always the one thing that Sally saw, saw it clearly and fully and knew just what she was going to do about it.","He held a mortgage on the land once, and though it was paid off in my father’s time I’m blessed if I know if there is anything to show for the payment at my end.","And there are others who say my place here is ‘so original and quaint’ and they must have a corner in their gardens just like it, so they take the seeds away to plant them somewhere in the Middle West where the ground bakes as hard as iron and the hot air dries up the buds before they can open.","If this was the way one learned to sail a boat, he supposed that he could master it as well as another.","The days went by, the poppies drooped their heads and scattered their petals in the winds, the early apples turned yellow on Captain Saulsby’s trees, and the blackberries ripened along the wall.","Now we’ve come so far we’ve got to get her.” “But—but—what do I do?” inquired Billy, quite bewildered at the task set him.","CHAPTER VIII                         THE STRANGER AT THE MILL There was a pause as Sally struggled with an obstinate latch, then she opened the door at the head of the stairs and disappeared.",The silence was so complete that Billy could hear the blood throbbing in his ears and the faint squeak of a board under Sally’s foot as she shifted her position.,"They’re taking boys of eighteen, sixteen even, if their parents say yes, fellows who have learned about as much of ships as they could find out from sailing chips in a duck-pond.","‘That lighthouse, should an accident happen there and some of the ships go on the rocks, it will be so many less against the Fatherland.’ Or, ‘That wireless station at Rockford, it is working to our harm; help to destroy it for the Fatherland.’ I sunk my boat that they might no longer try to send me on their errands.","Wait they did through the length of a hot, sultry day.","She advanced to the stairs, leaving Billy in the dark, climbed to the first landing and turned back to smile at him.","The time of Billy’s visit had come to an end; the morning of his departure arrived, and he came down, dressed in his travelling clothes, to say good-bye to his dear, good friend.","The wind was blowing fiercer and fiercer, and the spray dashing up in columns between the rocks.","The harbour he speaks of is at the northwest end—” They moved out of hearing, and Billy took the opportunity to stretch his cramped knees and shift his uneasy position before they should come back again.","If this wind could seem so sharp and bracing, if Lake Michigan could roll in such waves upon the beach, what would it be to feel the fresh sea breeze, and to hear the surf come thundering in on the shores of Appledore?","He was heartily ashamed of being there, eavesdropping but—well, one does not get into the war game often.","That will give her a chance to do a bit of real sailing.” The plan was readily agreed to by all concerned, apparently with the most heartiness by the _Josephine_ herself.","He tried to whistle to keep up the spirits of both of them, but the tune sounded high and queer and cracked, and he gave it up.","The old sailor himself seemed to be full of other thoughts, for when he spoke again it was as much to himself as to Billy.","They set out together down the lane, Billy feeling much cheered now that he had some notion of what they were to do.","“No,” they heard.","His mind had dropped away entirely into the past; he talked of Singapore now, and of hot still nights on the Indian ocean, or of the restless, choppy tossing of the China Sea.","He laid the glasses upon a ledge of rock, so that he should not break them as he clambered down to a lower level.","So America was to be guarded, so her Allies were to be given aid.",“Did you see anything?,"“That’s a dangerous kind of man, Billy Wentworth, the most risky kind a community can have.","He observed that the old sailor seemed very weary, that more than once his hands slipped from their hold and had to take a fresh grip.","He forgot Captain Saulsby completely, forgot everything except that he must run to help Sally.",Billy had a sudden feeling that it would be pleasant to rejoin Captain Saulsby and his Aunt as soon as it was possible.,"All of a sudden, as I stood there looking, I saw a full-rigged ship dead ahead of us, every sail spread out to the wind, her bow-wave slanting sharp out on each side from her cut-water, her wake showing clear in a white line of foam.","We were all dog-tired and could have slept where we stood, but the wind was still up and it wasn’t easy going yet.",We were right in line to ram her amidships; it seemed we couldn’t miss her except by a miracle.,"But on the fourth day, a clear cloudless one, with brisk winds and a sea so bright that it fairly hurt your eyes to look at it, he went down to see his friend Captain Saulsby and found that he, too, was caught by the fascination of this same war game.","Billy still clung to him and to the boat while his arms ached, then pricked and burned and finally became numb.","Wet footprints showed on the grey stone surface, as though somebody had but now walked across the weed-fringed rocks, uncovered by the half tide, and had then crossed the drier space above.","The sails were hoisted, the rudder adjusted and the little boat breathlessly lowered off the edge of a rock.","The old captain had revived enough to insist that he should be carried nowhere else, and had had the force to get his own way.","Captain Saulsby seemed to know just the moment when it was light enough for observation, for he pulled the glasses from his pocket, adjusted them, and looked long and earnestly out to sea.",He went up the steps in one breathless leap and came inside the mill.,"“I thought your clothes looked as though you had been doing something dreadful to them,” she said; “I am afraid they will never be good for anything again.” Billy did cut rather a sorry figure for he had been wet and dried and wet and dried again, before his long nap on the dusty floor.",I know all of that kind of vessel that sails in these waters and she’s a new one to me.” He adjusted the glass again and looked long at the moving speck and the wreath of smoke that trailed across the sea.,"We finally traced him down to the point here, but when we looked in at the window of the mill and heard the old captain swearing and shouting and saw only you two bending over him, we didn’t think our friend could possibly be there.","The boy was about to hurry after him, but Sally put her hand upon his arm.","“Listen.” The monotonous creak of rowlocks was plainly to be heard now, and the quiet dip and splash of oars as they rose and fell.",This was still the burden of his thoughts when the boat rounded the point into Rockford harbour and Appledore Island vanished from his sight.,"He went back along the point and up the beach path, thinking deeply.","It would be more interesting to relate his tale to them than to Aunt Mattie, although she was proving to be rather a good sort, too.","“Oh, stop her,” cried Billy, in frantic excitement.","I drifted here and drifted there, lost or spent my money the day after I got to port, and had to ship again in any berth I could.",Certainly the little boat was doing her best to be worthy of her so-famous namesake.,"Would you like to look in?” The big timbered door was fastened only by an iron latch, so there was no difficulty about pushing it open and peeping in.","If I had been young it would have been different, when lads aren’t used to standing watch such a thing may happen and we know they’ll learn better, but when an old sailor does it he can be sure of just one thing: his days at sea are near their end.",A camping trip—among those wonderful mountains—planned by himself—to include just the boys he wanted.,"There must have been a draught under the closed door at the top, for it made her candle wink and flicker, but she marched on undismayed.","Once more they stood off on the new course, the tubby little craft rising and dipping bravely, Billy clinging to the tiller and beginning to feel suddenly that the boat was a live thing under his hand, ready to do his slightest bidding.",If the tide were half an hour higher I would risk following.,"There was a big fireplace of rough stones, a bench near it, a table and a broken chair or two, with a three-legged stool in the chimney corner.","It was the week before Easter, the season of that April session of Congress when the war-bill slowly but surely made its way through Senate and House, and the possibility of a struggle became a final reality.","“He’s queerer than the Captain or Johann too,” thought Billy, and with some reason.","“She looks to me like one of those women who would try to grow poppies in a pot,” he said to Billy after she had gone.","He had been hanging to that boat four or five hours and that doesn’t tend to clear the brain.” “Well,” said the Captain, “I’m not very sure myself, but I may plan to look into the matter without telling him so.","My folks were like yours, though you wouldn’t think it; they were people with book-learning, doctors and lawyers and the like.","A friendly bluejacket who had also come to ask after the captain’s welfare, took Billy under his care, and offered to conduct him up on deck.","“If the whole United States Navy can’t catch a man like that,” he said weakly to Billy, “I guess it’s Ned Saulsby’s duty to keep in the world a little longer, and try to be a match for the rascal.” The doctor said that the old sailor’s recovery was miraculously quick; the Captain himself, that it was “slower than a wet week.” “That woman,” he would say, indicating the long-suffering nurse, “that woman that’s all rustles and starch and has no real heart, she keeps me down, when the only thing I need to get well is to walk out along the garden path and feel the good, warm sunshine on my back.” A day came, however, when “that woman’s” reign was over and she and the old captain bade each other good-bye.","That, he thought, must be part of what made him feel so queer.",Perhaps she had less imagination than other children and so was not apt to be aroused by the thought of dangerous possibilities.,He was at first angry to find he had no hope of reaching the other shore; then his anger turned quickly to a single thought—could he possibly struggle back to land again?,"For nearly three years the war had waged in Europe, a war far too big to realize, far too distant to be very disturbing to a schoolboy’s daily life.","As the boat puffed out of the harbour he leaned back in the deck chair, content at last, since he knew that now there were no more obstacles between him and his journey’s end.","It became plain to the boy, as he clung determinedly, with one arm around the old man and one flung over the ridge of the keel, that the boat was growing heavier and more water-logged with every wave to which she rose, that their one support was slowly settling beneath them.","“In Time of War and Tumults,” it was headed, and reminded him of what for a little time he had forgotten, that there was a war.","It is the Great Lakes Naval Station, where they train the sailors for the warships.","“The rest of the torpedo-boat flotilla is coming in, too,” said the sailor at his side, chuckling gleefully.","Poor things, I hate to think of them off somewhere drooping and withering for a whiff of fresh salt wind.” “Captain Saulsby,” said Billy gravely, “I do believe you care a lot for those flowers of yours.","By the time Billy had finished eating, she was not only in full possession of his story, but had put on her coat, had got ready a large bundle and a basket and had explained as much of the situation to her grandmother as spasmodic shouting could accomplish.","“I don’t think there is much fun in adventures that you have all alone,” was the grave comment that he made to himself as he stumbled up the beach.","The destroyer crept onward, feeling her way, altering her course every now and again to avoid some man-of-war swinging at anchor ahead of her.","“He certainly has had enough to kill any three ordinary men of his age,” Billy heard him say, “but an old sailor like that is made of iron and rubber and rhinoceros hide.","Captain Saulsby’s rheumatism seemed completely forgotten as he set off along the shore path to meet the boat when she came to port, with Aunt Mattie walking beside him.",He held a flag in each hand and was spelling out some signalled message in frantic haste.,"“I have wondered a good deal if they didn’t have something to do with each other.” “There’s Germans and Germans,” the old man answered."
