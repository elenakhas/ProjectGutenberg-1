"Lady Tinemouth expressed her pleasure at this meeting; and turning to the gentleman who was walking in silence by her side, said, ""Mr. Constantine, allow me to introduce to you the cousin of the amiable Miss Beaufort.""","cried she, turning suddenly towards him, and sinking clown on a chair, ""but do not give me such another look as that!""","Pembroke judged rightly of his friend; for if ever the real disinterested _amor patri√¶_ glowed in the breast of a man, it animated the heart of the young Sobieski.","""I'll teach pretty ladies to call names!""",Her dimpling smiles were now quite banished.,"I hope, Lady Dundas, you have not suffered any one to run away with her heart?","Your ladyship must know,"" cried she, ""that as Lady Sara and I were a moment ago driving up the Haymarket, I nodded to Mr. Coleman, who was coming out of the playhouse.","Thaddeus preferred this pathetic whim to her former Sapphic follies; it afforded him quiet, and relieved him from much embarrassment.","After a few kind words exchanged between the parties, they sat down with dejected countenances to their melancholy meal.","Rejoiced that he had succeeded where he had entertained no hope, Thaddeus, with a bow, was leaving the shop, when the man called after him, ""Stay, sir!""","""Nephew,"" returned the old lady, ""you are very peremptory.","and your message is not delivered.""",The arrival of Miss Dundas at the Lodge was communicated to the two young men on their return from traversing half the country in quest of game.,"In the course of an hour, her son appeared from her apartment and joined the general.","Try to forget his injustice, my dear son; and in memory of me, never part with that picture.","When the young count, during the prominent interests of the late disastrous campaign, remembered these things, he found little comfort in recollecting the name of his young English guest; and now that he was visiting England as a poor exile, with indignation and grief he gave up the wish with the hope of meeting Mr. Somerset.","from thy ravaged plains,   So mourning o'er thy sad and but loved remains,   A houseless wretch, I wander through the world,   From friends, from greatness, and from glory hurl'd!","He went past him, speaking these words-- ""I trust, father, that ingratitude is not his vice.""","By Jove, I believe him to be some Russian nobleman; perhaps the great Suwarrow himself!","When in his own room, he shut the door, and cast a wild and inquisitive gaze around the apartment; then, throwing himself into a chair, he struck his head with his hand, and exclaimed, ""It is gone!","Thaddeus threw the verses and the medallion together on the table, and sat for a few minutes considering how he could extricate himself from an affair so truly farcical in itself, but which might be productive of a very distressing consequence to him.",I cannot understand by these generous emotions that he objects to receive me as your friend.,"Two days before my arrival, that general, according to orders, had disbanded his whole party.","The count rose, and attempted to support her agitated frame on his arm; but she trembled so, he was obliged to almost carry her down stairs.","The baronet, incapable of saying more, pointed to a chair for him to sit down; then sinking into another himself, took out his handkerchief, and wiping away the large drops which stood on his forehead, panted for respiration.","Lascelles took the surface of this speech, and bowed, whilst his lordship, turning to Miss Beaufort, began to compliment himself on possessing so fair an ally in defence of an absent person.",But the Misses Dundas possessed too much money to think of its utility; they used it as counters; for they had no conception that to other people it might be the purchaser of almost every comfort.,"The good woman instantly replied that ""Mrs. Watts, her neighbor, had a nephew at present lodging with her, a steady man, recently made one of the grooms in the King's Mews, and as this was the customary hour of his return from the stables, she was sure he would be glad to do the service.""",Here all the proud energies of his nature again rallied round his heart.,"""That may be,"" resumed Lady Sara, laughing, and anxious to excite some emotion of rivalry in the breast of Thaddeus.","Grasping the hand of his friend, he gazed on his averted and dejected features with a look of desperate horror.","Three parts the army shall have; the other we must expend in giving support to the surviving families of the brave men who have fallen in our defence.""","General Wawrzecki, with his officers, begged permission to pay their personal gratitude to the countess for the hospitality of her reception; but she declined the honor, on the plea of indisposition.",Was it not the very personification of Youth upholding the fainting steps of Age?,"The sincere sentiment of equality with themselves which these two ladies evinced by their behavior to him, and the same conduct being adopted by Miss Dorothy and her beautiful niece, besides the evident partiality of Euphemia, altogether inflamed the spleen of Miss Dundas, and excited her _coterie_ to acts of the most extravagant rudeness.","""I thank you, sir,"" she replied, ""and I accept your offer with gratitude.","He would have said, as he did it, ""So, my father, I would have sheltered thy life with my own!""","""Even so,"" returned Thaddeus, pressing her hand.","During the first month of Mary's acquaintance with Thaddeus, she did not neglect to mention in her correspondence with Pembroke having met with a very interesting and accomplished emigrant, in the capacity of a tutor at Lady Dundas's.",Her heart beat with increased violence.,"It matters not to the undistinguishing bolt of carnage whether it strike common breasts or those rare hearts whose lives are usually as brief as they are dazzling;

but as he advanced, his hopes died away, and his fears and reluctance re-awakened.","You could never betray the self-deluded Lady Sara to any fatal error!""","Euphemia never made a secret of the tenderness she professed;
