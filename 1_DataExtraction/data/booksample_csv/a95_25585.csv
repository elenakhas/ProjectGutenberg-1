"It prepares and initiates the excitement required for the entire piece, and yet does not demand anything from the spectators, which their previous habits had not fitted them to understand.","It may be so: but who can doubt that it is a mistake for ""my father's child,"" meaning herself?","""Macbeth.""","I know no part of Shakespeare that more impresses on me the belief of his genius being superhuman, than this scene between Brutus and Cassius.","You must be mine,” &c. Seward’s note, and reading:—      ... “Whiteness of name, You must be mine!” Nonsense!","He is all-powerful without strength; he wishes the end, but is irresolute as to the means; conscience distinctly warns him, and he lulls it imperfectly:-- ""If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me Without my stir.""","In the very first speech of Miranda, the simplicity and tenderness of her character are at once laid open;--it would have been lost in direct contact with the agitation of the first scene.",2.,"_Non quod verum est, sed quod verisimile_, is the dramatist's rule.","Then Horatio, the representative of the ignorance of the audience, not himself, but by Marcellus to Bernardo, anticipates the common solution--""'tis but our fantasy!""",O miserable defender!,and the _sancta simplicitas_ of honest dull Theobald’s faith in him!,"They are wholly different from any representation of witches in the contemporary writers, and yet presented a sufficient external resemblance to the creatures of vulgar prejudice to act immediately on the audience.",Macbeth.,"“And yēt,” is a complete _iambus_; but _anyet_ is, like _spirit_, a dibrach u u, trocheized, however, by the _arsis_ or first accent damping, though not extinguishing, the second.","from the mere courtesy of his ""Welcome, good Marcellus!""",1 of the _Tempest_.,"The comic and tragic parts equally border on the μισητὸν,—the one being disgusting, the other horrible; and the pardon and marriage of Angelo not merely baffles the strong indignant claim of justice—(for cruelty, with lust and damnable baseness, cannot be forgiven, because we cannot conceive them as being morally repented of); but it is likewise degrading to the character of woman.","To distinguish that which is legitimate in Shakespeare from what does not belong to him, we must observe his varied images symbolical of novel truth, thrusting by, and seeming to trip up each other, from an impetuosity of thought, producing a flowing metre, and seldom closing with the line.",The generalisation is done to the poet's hand.,"I will only further remark the sweet and tempered gravity, with which Shakespeare in the end draws the only fitting moral which such a drama afforded.","The proper and immediate object of science is the acquirement, or communication, of truth; the proper and immediate object of poetry is the communication of immediate pleasure.","With the single exception of _Cymbeline_, they either place before us at one glance both the past and the future in some effect, which implies the continuance and full agency of its cause, as in the feuds and party-spirit of the servants of the two houses in the first scene of _Romeo and Juliet_; or in the degrading passion for shows and public spectacles, and the overwhelming attachment for the newest successful war-chief in the Roman people, already become a populace, contrasted with the jealousy of the nobles in _Julius Caesar_;--or they at once commence the action so as to excite a curiosity for the explanation in the following scenes, as in the storm of wind and waves, and the boatswain in the _Tempest_, instead of anticipating our curiosity, as in most other first scenes, and in too many other first acts;--or they act, by contrast of diction suited to the characters, at once to heighten the effect, and yet to give a naturalness to the language and rhythm of the principal personages, either as that of Prospero and Miranda by the appropriate lowness of the style, or as in _King John_, by the equally appropriate stateliness of official harangues or narratives, so that the after blank verse seems to belong to the rank and quality of the speakers, and not to the poet;--or they strike at once the key-note, and give the predominant spirit of the play, as in the _Twelfth Night_ and in _Macbeth_;--or finally, the first scene comprises all these advantages at once, as in _Hamlet_.","Hence we may admit the appropriateness to the old comedy, as a work of defined art, of allusions and descriptions, which morality can never justify, and, only with reference to the author himself, and only as being the effect or rather the cause of the circumstances in which he wrote, can consent even to palliate.","Yet hitherto no reason appears why it should be other than the not unusual pride of person, talent, and birth,--a pride auxiliary, if not akin, to many virtues, and the natural ally of honourable impulses.","_Ib._-- ""_Ham._ Excellent well; You are a fishmonger.""",-- as if praising the crime of Edmund's birth!,sc.,"Mend me, thou saucy fellow!""",Independence of the dramatic interest on the plot.,"I dare not, will not, think that honest Ben had _Lear_ in his mind in this mock mad scene.","The spirit of poetry, like all other living powers, must of necessity circumscribe itself by rules, were it only to unite power with beauty.","Take it and _Sejanus_, as compositions of a particular kind, namely, as a mode of relating great historical events in the liveliest and most interesting manner, and I cannot help wishing that we had whole volumes of such plays.","Just as Ben Jonson, who applied himself to the drama after having served in Flanders, fills his earliest plays with true or pretended soldiers, the wrongs and neglects of the former, and the absurd boasts and knavery of their counterfeits.","I shall, perhaps, have occasion to observe that this remark is not without importance in explaining the essential differences of the modern and ancient theatres.",Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change.,"I grieve that every late voluminous edition of his works would enable me to substantiate the present charge with a variety of facts, one-tenth of which would of themselves exhaust the time allotted to me.","All external nature in a storm, all moral nature convulsed,—the real madness of Lear, the feigned madness of Edgar, the babbling of the Fool, the desperate fidelity of Kent—surely such a scene was never conceived before or since!","I rather think that Shakespeare meant ""pleurisy,"" but involved in it the thought of _plethora_, as supposing pleurisy to arise from too much blood; otherwise I cannot explain the following line-- ""And then this _should_ is like a spendthrift sigh, That hurts by easing.""",sc.,_Ib._ sc.,"_Alb._ I cannot be so partial, Goneril, To the great love I bear you.","The first of the kind is, I believe, the only one preserved,—namely, the Χριστὸς Πάσχων, or, “Christ in his sufferings,” by Gregory Nazianzen,—possibly written in consequence of the prohibition of profane literature to the Christians by the apostate Julian.","I would take Dr. Farmer’s “umber’d,” which I had proposed before I ever heard of its having been already offered by him: but I do not adopt his interpretation of the word, which I think is not derived from _umbra_, a shade, but from _umber_, a dingy yellow-brown soil, which most commonly forms the mass of the sludge on the sea-shore, and on the banks of tide-rivers at low water.","***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SHAKESPEARE, BEN JONSON, BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER*** CREDITS May 24, 2008             Project Gutenberg TEI edition 1             Produced by Marilynda Fraser-Cunliffe, David King, and the             Online Distributed Proofreading Team at             <http://www.pgdp.net/>.","I have stated that the transitional link between the epic poem and the drama is the historic drama; that in the epic poem a pre-announced fate gradually adjusts and employs the will and the events as its instruments, whilst the drama, on the other hand, places fate and will in opposition to each other, and is then most perfect, when the victory of fate is obtained in consequence of imperfections in the opposing will, so as to leave a final impression that the fate itself is but a higher and a more intelligent will.","They presented Mysteries, and often at great expense; and reliques of this system still remain in the south of Europe, and indeed throughout Italy, where at Christmas the convents and the great nobles rival each other in the scenic representation of the birth of Christ and its circumstances.","I gave these lectures at the Royal Institution, before six or seven hundred auditors of rank and eminence, in the spring of the same year, in which Sir Humphrey Davy, a fellow-lecturer, made his great revolutionary discoveries in chemistry.","Sir Roger’s speech:—     “Did I for this consume my _quarters_ in meditations, vows, and     woo’d her in heroical epistles?","FOURTH EPOCH gives all the graces and facilities of a genius in full possession and habitual exercise of power, and peculiarly of the feminine, the _lady's_ character.",5.,"In Hamlet this balance is disturbed: his thoughts, and the images of his fancy, are far more vivid than his actual perceptions, and his very perceptions, instantly passing through the _medium_ of his contemplations, acquire, as they pass, a form and a colour not naturally their own.",FOURTH EPOCH.,"Surely it ought to be considered a very exalted compliment to women, that all the sarcasms on them in Shakespeare are put in the mouths of villains.","In observation of living characters—of landlords and postilions—Fielding has great excellence; but in drawing from his own heart, and depicting that species of character, which no observation could teach, he failed in comparison with Richardson, who perpetually places himself, as it were, in a day-dream.","And, finally, at its very point of culmination--       Lear.","And hence, also, there is an entire absence of comedy, nay, even of irony and philosophic contemplation in _Macbeth_,--the play being wholly and purely tragic.","“Love’s Labour’s Lost.” The characters in this play are either impersonated out of Shakespeare’s own multiformity by imaginative self-position, or out of such as a country town and schoolboy’s observation might supply,—the curate, the schoolmaster, the Armado (who even in my time was not extinct in the cheaper inns of North Wales), and so on.",3.,"Amphibrachys, u - u = _dĕlīghtfŭl_.","The seeming inconsistencies in the conduct and character of Hamlet have long exercised the conjectural ingenuity of critics; and, as we are always loth to suppose that the cause of defective apprehension is in ourselves, the mystery has been too commonly explained by the very easy process of setting it down as in fact inexplicable, and by resolving the phenomenon into a misgrowth or _lusus_ of the capricious and irregular genius of Shakespeare.","I heard two instances mentioned to me at different times, one in Sicily and the other in Rome, of noble devotees, the ruin of whose fortunes was said to have commenced in the extravagant expense which had been incurred in presenting the _præsepe_ or manger.","Wit ever wakeful, fancy busy and procreative as an insect, courage, an easy mind that, without cares of its own, is at once disposed to laugh away those of others, and yet to be interested in them,--these and all congenial qualities, melting into the common _copula_ of them all, the man of rank and the gentleman, with all its excellencies and all its weaknesses, constitute the character of Mercutio!","One other possible interpretation of this sentence has occurred to me, just barely worth mentioning;--that the ""twinn'd stones"" are the _augrim_ stones upon the number'd beech,--that is, the astronomical tables of beech-wood.",_Ib._ How admirably Macduff's grief is in harmony with the whole play!,"Shakespeare may sometimes be gross, but I boldly say that he is always moral and modest.",1.,"Heaven have mercy on poor Shakespeare, and also on Mr. Warburton's mind's eye!","The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} License must appear prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} work (any work on which the phrase ""Project Gutenberg"" appears, or with which the phrase ""Project Gutenberg"" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or distributed:     This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with     almost no restrictions whatsoever.","Hence it is that the sense of sublimity arises, not from the sight of an outward object, but from the beholder's reflection upon it;--not from the sensuous impression, but from the imaginative reflex.","_Sil._ I do not know The heart of his designs;
