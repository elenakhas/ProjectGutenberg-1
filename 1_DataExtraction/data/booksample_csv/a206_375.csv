"Keen, poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs.",How slowly it appeared to move!,He was a Federal scout.,"At a signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down between two ties.","Ah, that was a fine endeavor!",With their greater infrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness.,"Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell.",Farquhar dived--dived as deeply as he could.,The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle.,"""They will not do that again,"" he thought; ""the next time they will use a charge of grape.",What a sluggish stream!,One lodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably warm and he snatched it out.,The arrangement commended itself to his judgement as simple and effective.,He felt the ripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck.,.,What he heard was the ticking of his watch.,A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the rush of its body parting the water.,He watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck.,"He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced.","The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light.","He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf--he saw the very insects upon them:  the locusts, the brilliant bodied flies, the gray spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig.","""Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge.""","He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible!",.,Farquhar asked.,"The intellectual part of his nature was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was torment.","""The Yanks are repairing the railroads,"" said the man, ""and are getting ready for another advance.","An appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a loud, rushing sound, DIMINUENDO, which seemed to travel back through the air to the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to its deeps!",.,Meanwhile he did what he could.,"The liberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.","The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels, or trains will be summarily hanged.","The water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and men, all were commingled and blurred.","The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank.",They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature.,"What splendid effort!--what magnificent, what superhuman strength!",This plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant.,Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands.,.,"He wore a moustache and pointed beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp.","""Put it back, put it back!""","""Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,"" said Farquhar, smiling, ""what could he accomplish?""",While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.,Suddenly he felt himself whirled round and round--spinning like a top.,They were in silhouette against the blue sky.,"He dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and audibly blessed it.",He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and children.,"The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not quite, reached a fourth.","II Peyton Farquhar was a well to do planter, of an old and highly respected Alabama family.","""To be hanged and drowned,"" he thought, ""that is not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot.","Being a slave owner and like other slave owners a politician, he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the Southern cause.","One evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water.",There was something uncanny in the revelation.,Attention!,.,"Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he was now merely the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum.","He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point, and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners.","They were, indeed, preternaturally keen and alert.","Striking through the thought of his dear ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith's hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality.",Something in the awful disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that they made record of things never before perceived.,.,To die of hanging at the bottom of a river!--the idea seemed to him ludicrous.,.,"As to his head, he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fullness--of congestion.","As he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he heard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and in an instant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond.","He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle.",.,.,.,"That is a good gun.""","Circumstances of an imperious nature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from taking service with that gallant army which had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the inglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the larger life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction.","They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface.",The thought of his wife and children urged him on.,His whole body was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish!,"It is now dry and would burn like tinder.""","""I was there a month ago,"" he replied.","""If I could free my hands,"" he thought, ""I might throw off the noose and spring into the stream.","The trees upon the bank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms.",.,.,He noted the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass.,Objects were represented by their colors only;
