and when, after the maiden had left us (having restored us our swords under promise of peace), I told him my story, he took my hand, and said, had he been in my shoes, he had been a traitor too.",That they were coming my way was evident by the crackling of the underwood and the impatience of the horse.,"The old dotard turned the colour of my teeth when he looked up and spied it.""","I bade them, angrily enough, unhand me and let me go by, as I was an honest citizen, and pressed on an errand to Cheapside.",said the soldier gasping.,"But since we held up, and drifted within reach of his line, he honoured us by casting it our way;
