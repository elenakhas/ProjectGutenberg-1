It saved my life.,"*       *       *       *       * Next morning, on the way to the electric train, Ernie made a purchase at the drugstore.","""And cheer up, I say.","Nevertheless there were times when he seriously wished he'd never acquired whatever power it was--except for Vivian, of course.",His sister grabbed his arm.,Then he saw he was parked in front of a demolished old apartment building a few blocks from his home.,It became noticeable about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each side--an invisible slim vertical cylinder.,Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't decided anyway who that would be).,"Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough ration of air.","Flashing eyes.""","""I tell him he's attractive because he has Flashing Eyes and within two days he's wearing black glasses.",Great relief.,"Afterward, Bert Willis used to say it was one of the most mystifying experiences of his life.",There was nothing to see.,"I mean are they painful?""",But my chief sources of information I am not permitted to disclose.),He moved stiffly toward the door.,"He didn't care who yelled at him or whom he bumped, so long as it didn't slow him down.",Ernie jumped up and blurted out introductions.,"Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's surprise and embarrassment.","Now, sober again, he had a clear confirmation of it when he left a banquet on a trumped-up excuse because of a disturbing vision of inexplicable rodlike shapes--and read the next day that a hundred of the guests, of whom four finally died, had come down with bacterial food poisoning.","""Who's been getting at you?""","He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the stuff--perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's.","He puts her on whenever he gets afraid he's getting attractive.""",Mr. Jones brought him over half an hour ago and it's all arranged.,"No, thanks.""","Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they should be.",He thought of the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor.,Ernie was one in a long series of such men.,That circumstance seemed beyond imagination.,"For instance, that trick of having the images on the box fade back to the old ones.""",He hadn't intended to wear them by day and hardly knew why he'd put them on before joining Vivian.,He was pale.,"Ernie, they had to admit, was a remarkably well-preserved old gent.",And how?,"""No,"" she said, ""I didn't,"" and she looked at him steadily, as she had that morning.",He knew that the powder worked.,"I'm putting some eye-drops in them now.""",Now he had used the tube to siphon out what he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!),He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.,"After dinner, he decided it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch.",The people were just blurs anyway and soon he was beyond them.,"""Thuringer sausage at lunch.""","Ironic, considering what a drunk he'd been and what strange junk he insisted on eating now.","""Me attractive?","Next moment he was in a small cab under which steel rails were vanishing at an alarming speed, and way ahead he could just make out the platform on which he was standing, and something was hurting his head and he was slumping forward and everything was darkening and the cab was leaping forward more swiftly still.","However, they were grateful to the Cosmic All-Father.",Add     water as needed.,He turned it over several times.,He was trying to be the same without much success.,"""This is where I get off.""","""Oh.""",*       *       *       *       * He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat.,"Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded, the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind individually, or at most in strings of three and four.","Vivian accepted his seat with a certain deliberateness and with a smile that seemed to Ernie to say, ""So I'm his morning light-badinage girl, but this is the girl Mr. Meeker goes home with.","For a good half a day, Ernie Meeker studied the rows of jars, canisters and glass-stoppered bottles, sometimes lifting two down together and contemplating them, one in each hand, as if he could weigh the difference.","I do hope you won't mind.""","Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself, the first of the Big Gifts.","In fact, he felt distinctly apathetic when his sister confronted him and only with an effort did he manage to brace himself for the trial he knew she had in store for him.",*       *       *       *       * That evening marked the beginning of Ernie's serious drinking.,"But under the present circumstances, Ernie was confused.","""In any case, don't get conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know how to take advantage of them.""","Which, if it wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least darn comfortable.",Ernie nodded.,"Ridiculous, of course.","Things should behave as you expected them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the barely conscious level.","It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring way.",Gifts are upsetting.,"*       *       *       *       * Verna, on the other hand, had absolute confidence that she was sufficiently attractive for all practical purposes.","""It's his life and he's doing what he thinks best.""","""Sometimes I think the tests are _too_ fair,"" the Coadjutor observed.",She nodded absently.,"That last picture was the most vivid, and when he realized he had actually stopped his car, it was a moment before it would go away.","Could there be something wrong about the bathroom, something either in the room itself or in his childhood associations?","*       *       *       *       * As the Invisible Being had predicted, Ernie's first brush with the Great Gift gave him a considerable jolt, though he didn't suspect at first that it was a permanent gift.","""Just that you put your hand up to them as if they hurt.""",It was while you were out of the room.,And yet he did no more bathroom testing.,"If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man in a trenchcoat, _then_ he'd have felt more able to _do_ something about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company or of going to the F.B.I.",Of course the car still ran.,"""In that case,"" Uncle Fabius opined, ""you can be sure some fuel-powder swindler has been getting at _him_.","Once, at a party, he bet twenty dollars that his eyes glowed in the dark.","*       *       *       *       * Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city."
