"He passed through the old castle into an orchard that had been sawed down, and looked like a tree-churchyard; then into a pale wood, full of peeled May-trees, which with faded ribbons and banners all looked toward Elysium,--a withered pleasure grove of so many happy days.","So stands Mont Blanc before the rising moon; night veils his feet and his breast, but the light summit hangs high in the dark heaven as a star among the stars.","He came--disappointing one's expectation of an ecclesiastical gravity--with a light playfulness upon the gay train, and laid his finger in benediction on the forehead of Liana, who seemed to be his granddaughter, as it were, a second tree-blossom in the late autumn of life.","His sister he had hitherto loved as a friend,--so fraternally, so freely, so increasingly!","Mutely, and with wet eyes, she handed to her who had been hitherto her comforter the heavy sheet.",or would you yourselves?,"Here, however, with firm hand she held fast the veil over her experiences; he too had known long since, that, notwithstanding her most tremblingly delicate feelings, which shrunk even from the sight of the blue veins on the lily hand, as from a wound, she had appeared unexpectedly courageous before the dead and in the ghostly hours of fantasy.","Charles might certainly, e. g. not wish to mix up the holy time of the first recognition with this bustle of taking the allegiance-oath,--or that first suicidal masquerade might have made every succeeding one an inspiring era of a new second life,--or he knew, perhaps, in fact, about Albano's birthday,--or, finally, this glowing spirit chose to run or fly on his own track.","The tender Julienne perceived that she had to spare an agitated heart; after a tolerably loud silence, she said, in a serious tone: ""A lovely evening,--we'll go to the water-house.","How comes this soft one intelligibly by his paternal name, unless one assumes the old hypothesis, that children are usually most like that for which the pregnant mother vainly longed, which in this case was a soft spouse?","The Lector himself started not that question; for he never made rash, unsafe plans; and what one would have been more so than that of such a connection, in his poverty, or with such a father-in-law, in a country where, as in the Electorate of Saxony, a statute, so beneficial (for parents), can countermand even a marriage of many years' standing, which has been concluded without parental consent?",he started up.,"All grand situations of humanity, all emotions to which Love and Friendship and Nature exalt the heart, all these he went through in poems earlier than in life, as play-actor and theatre-poet earlier than as man, earlier on the sunny side of fancy than on the stormy side of reality; hence, when they at last appeared, living, in his breast, he could deliberately seize them, govern them, kill them, and stuff them well for the refrigeratory of future remembrance.","As, after a warm rain, the evening-red      and the liquid sunlight run from all the gold-green hills,      so stood a quivering splendor over my whole inner being and      over my past, and everywhere lay bright tears of joy.",1.E.8.,"In the castle how profusely was his heart covered with hearts, and the youngest love drowned by the old, from the easily weeping mother, Albina, even to the hand-extending old servants, who, on his account, stirred more briskly their petrified limbs!","It has already to-day, Albano,"" she added, in a lower and fainter tone, ""twice appeared to me on the way, when I heard the inner music, and previously in the thunder-house, when the sun went down, and has affectionately answered me.""","Schoppe, readily divining that with this female soul-dealer the walk or _gang_ was a press-gang,[93] the white linen, hunting-gear, the shawl, a bird-net,[94] and the neck, a swan's-neck for any fox that happened to be near, caught her by the hand at the threshold of the two chambers, and asked her, ""Do you, also, take as much interest as I in the universal joy of the land, and the long-desired court-mourning?","Already, for a considerable time, had Froulay been full of noticeable, stormy signs, and might any moment, one must needs fear, let the thunderbolt fly from him; that is to say, he was gay and mild.","Here, attended by a torch-dance of gleaming hopes, he went to and fro, but his eye was a telescope, and his ear was a hearing-trumpet.","""And into this unlocked world I had come back restored and      so happy.","""Thou?","O, if thou at this hour of death's      juggleries art contemplating the pale Prince, with the      images of youth on his breast, and thinking of the gray      friend who secretly bewails him in Tartarus, then will thy      heart dissolve, and in soft, warm flames run round through      thy bosom, and softly say: 'I will love, and then die, and      then love--O Almighty, show me the soul which longs and      languishes like mine!'","why weepest thou?""","While he portrayed with grateful remembrance his sister Rabette, Julienne became so earnestly and deeply absorbed in his eye, that she started, and asked the Lector about the steps of the _Anglaise_ which he had led at the masquerade.","He sometimes commanded impossible things, in order to meet with as much disobedience as his anger needed for the purpose of venting itself in punishment.","Albano clasped accidentally the neighboring statue with both hands, and said: ""On high places, one wants to throw something down,--even himself oftentimes; and I, too, would fain throw myself off into the world, into far-distant lands, as often as I gaze into the nightly redness yonder, and as often as I come under orangery-blossoms, as under these.",40.,"He would have done it--and put an untimely end to his life and my Titan--merely because he dreaded the disgrace of the real and verbal insults he might get from his father before so many people (yes, in the chariot sat a gentleman who was a perfect stranger) worse than suicide and hell.","But his warm heart, always expressing itself, demanded a warmer society, and this he found when he followed the pious father, and went to Lilar into the Thunderhouse, into the midst of the flowers and summits, in order, lying nearer to the heart of Nature, to dream and enjoy more sweetly.","cried Schoppe, ""in there sits, bodily, Cephisio, from Rome, who must sometime or other give me a sound drubbing.""","The century casts the flower-seeds of thy joy only from the porous sowing-machine of minutes, or rather, to the blest eternity itself there is no other handle than the instant.","He praised them for opening the _bal masqu√©_ of the new administration with these slow minuet steps, and preparing themselves for the waltz of the wedding and the grandfather's-dance of the allegiance-day.","The Vienna master wished also, of course, to draw the Count--to whom he only showed the coasts of Roquairol's isle of friendship afar off, but no point for landing--cunningly away from the brother through the sister (he had found it impossible longer to deceive and hold him back); for why did he paint it out before him at such length, how poisonously, some years before, the night-and death-chill brought on by that parting shot of a brother whom she too devotedly loved had fallen upon those tender, white leaves of her heart?",The day came.,"He stationed himself on the balcony, and held on by the colossal statue; and his eye glanced down to the lake, and up to the Alps and to the heavens, and down again; and, under the friendly air of Hesperia, all the waves and all the leaves fluttered beneath their light veil.","She stirred both to the depths of the soul, because the poor creature, with the labor of her helpless voice, was rendering her loved one the meek sacrifice of obedience.","The longing to see Don Zesara caught new warmth from the Roman history, which lifted up on high before him Caesar's colossal image, and wrote under it, ""Zesara.""","Ah, could he not more willingly have beset the Director for some romances out of the portable-library of the Minister's lady, in which the daughter must certainly have read, yes, and might well even have forgotten some notes of her reading?","A southeast breeze had arisen from its siesta in Rome, and flying along had cooled itself by the way in the tops of the lemon-trees and in a thousand brooks and shadows, and now lay cradled in the arms of the cypress.","From the dormer-window might be seen a returning village funeral-procession, conglomerated around the spot on the bank where Schoppe had plunged in.","I could wish nothing finer for one whom I held dear, than a mother,--a sister,--three years of living together on Isola Bella,--and then in the twentieth, a morning hour when he should land on the Eden-island, and, enjoying all this with the eye and memory at once, clasp and strain it to his open soul.","Albano stood to it, that the still light of health was more dignified than the poppy-oil flame of a slave of opium; and the fate of being prisoner of war to the body, which one spirit has to bear in common with the whole human army, more honorable than the cramping confinement of a personal arrest.","To be sure, Schoppe remarked, she would carry the child more _lightly_ on her left arm;[4] but the error of the good youth is a merit in him as well as the truth.","With the most unembarrassed heartiness, the architect disclosed to the glowing youth, ""They should from this time forth see each other every week, since he was to come daily to oversee the building of the church.""","That is to say, the above-mentioned anecdote--Bouverot's guardianship of the hereditary Prince on his travels, or the design of the thing--had at both courts come to be the common talk in assemblies and at tables, and was hidden only from the Prince Luigi; for on thrones, there are almost no mysteries to any one excepting him (hardly his wife) who sits thereupon, as in whispering-galleries the people in distant corners hear everything aloud, only not he who stands in the middle.","When the bright moon and flute-tones from the vale awakened him again, the silent rapture still glowed on under the ashes of slumber, and grew till it closed his eyes again.",The tenderly-moved souls did not remark that the word Charles came from the letter.,But as yet the image hangs with its face toward the wall.,"In the mystic bower, where the dead Prince had stalked along before him in the by-cavern, he found no such cavern, but only an empty niche.",Marcion.,"Singularly did the impure roil on his face contrast with the aftersummer serenity on hers, although before witnesses, as it seemed, he took away the irony from his courteousness towards her, and kept hatred, as others do love, only for solitude.","excepting because thou, like the Bourignon, didst not once know what was to be avoided, and because thy holy guilelessness excluded the suspicious spying out of remote designs, the bending of the ear toward the ground to listen for an approaching foe, and all coquettish manifestoes and warlike preparations?","Linda, as will be well remembered, is the baptismal name of the young Countess of Romeiro, with whom the Princess on the day of that (for Roquairol) so bloody masquerade had established an eternal heart- and letter-alliance; Liana, to whose pure, poetic eyes every noble woman became a blessed saint and heroine, the opaque jewel a bright, pure, transparent one, loved the high Countess as if with the heart of her brother and her female friend at once, and the gentle soul named herself, unconscious of her worth, only the little Linda of her Elisa.","It is just in this way that we authors mount to such heights; hence it is that even the worst of us, if we hold out, become somewhat, at last, and write ourselves up from Schilda to Abdera, and from there away up to Grub Street.","Liana had preserved, in the midst of the stormy mill-races of daily _assemblees_, a low voice and a delicate ear, and the tumult had driven her inward, and left her almost shy.","A simple little chamber,--under a green twilight of glimmering vine foliage, some books of Fenelon and Herder, old flowers still in their water-glasses, little Chinese dishes, Julienne's portrait, and another of a deceased youthful friend, whose name was Caroline, an unstained writing-stand, with English-pressed paper,--was what he found.","Thou anguish-stricken blind one, what say'st thou,--have I made thee truly miserable again?""","She shunned every path toward the south, where Tartarus frowned behind its high curtain.","Julienne almost said no to yes, and yes to no; only toward the Minister's lady was she serious and submissive,--a sign that, on her arena of disputation, among the grains of sand particles of golden sand still lay, whereas for philosophers the arena is the prize and the ground,--at once the battle-field, the _Champ de Mars_, and the _Champs Elys√©es_.","But the longer he saw the procession growing, that loose juggler's thread, by which they were letting down the empty but figured chest of Cypselus[100] into the family vault, so much the more indignant became his mockery.","Schoppe generally began with _comic_ humor, and ended with _tragic_; so also now did the empty mourning-chest, the crape of the horses, their emblazoned caparisons, the Prince's contempt of the heavy German Ceremonial; in short, the whole heartless mummery, lead him up to an eminence, to which the contemplation of a multitude of men at once always impelled him, and where, with an exaltation, indignation, and laughing bitterness hard to describe, he looked down upon the eternal, tyrannical, belittling, objectless and joyless, bewildered and oppressed frenzy of mankind, and his own too.",SEVENTH JUBILEE.,"His cheeks glowed, his heart flamed, he stood, priest-like, before the altar of friendship, with the fairest offering, sincerity.",His breast was here already warmed under the vulture-skin of rage.,"Then it brought him out into the open country, and now Lilar, from the east, flung, over the wide-extending spikes of grain, the splendor of a high golden ball to meet him.","""At last I wrote the poem of thanks which I append to this,      and which I will put into verse, if the _pious father_      approves.","For if it was not for appearance' sake, why did he paste up such very long altar-pieces of Liana's charms before Rabette, that impartial one, who, vying only with parsons' daughters, and not with those of ministers, heard almost as gladly the praise of _city_ beauties as we do of _Homer's_, and in whose presence only a windy fool, that would fain hold himself upright in the saddle before women by singing the praises of other women, could intone such eulogies as his were of Liana?",Only one request!,"Truly, thou art not right.""",[62] Pride of the meadows quickens the circulation of the blood even to frenzy.,"""The Exchequer and the Court,"" said he, ""have been, of course, from time immemorial, such as they are; but the Princes, dear sir, are good; they are themselves sucked dry, and then they seem to be the suckers.""",Liana led the way to Blumenbuehl over the still-blooming churchyard of buried days.,"March on, drunk with joy, full of young, light images, through the Italian night, which glimmers and breathes its fragrance around thee, and which, as over Hesperia, not far from the warm moon, hangs out a golden evening-star[42] in the blue west, as if over the dwelling of the beloved soul!","Her love was love of man,--her smile was meant for every kind eye,--she was so cheerful.","""Peace, fool!","Yes indeed, heavenly one!","The sun had laid itself with a      motherly warmth on my heart, and brooded over us all,--the      cold flower, the naked young bird, the stiff butterfly, and      every creature.","But Liana, as if for the sake of turning aside his enthusiasm, came upon the subject of her friend Caroline, and told how she always hovered before her on such days, and especially on this walk.","""Herr von Froulay!""","Why she, and to-day?","The embracing death-flood sounded with one arm around her; then did she see, without looking up, her Caroline pass by somewhere in bridal dress, and with the white, gold-spangled veil trailing along far over life; and she saw clearly how the celestial shape, when Albano begged for her life, shook its head slowly to and fro.","""Mr."
