recall all the course of your life, and recollect at what period this great change you speak of began.",Augustine_.,"The way to despair is for ever open, and everything goads one's miserable soul to self-destruction.","Petrarch._ While the doctor is finishing his advice, will he allow the patient, in the throes of his malady, to interrupt him for a minute?",[35] _S.,"And, on the other hand, I have heard the King, sitting on his high place, his sceptre grasped in his hand, subduing, binding in chains, and imprisoning those rebel blasts,--who can doubt that with equal appropriateness this applies to the Reason?",Do you know what stands in the way of your purpose of heart?,"[4] _Æneid_, iv.","""[25] For how can you continue in safety in these scenes where there are so many memories of your wounds, where things present and the memory of things past cling always to you?",Augustine._ And why?,"And therefore, just as it is impossible that your body should not cast a shadow if the sun is shining, so it is impossible also in the light of God Himself that virtues should exist and not make their glory to appear.","But, to follow the steps of so great an authority, let us suppose there are three.","The unwonted dazzle blinded your eyes, so I believe.","Moreover, if you had no other warning, the stormy course of life itself, which every day robs you of something, ought to show you how transient and perishing that flower of beauty is.","Though I feel that her attraction draws me to her with hooks of steel, nevertheless if I have to go, I can.",It is proved by the fatigue you suffer from even little things.,"But since you feel, and rightly so, that something still is wanting, I will try and unfold to you what it is, and, if God so please, remove it also; to the end that you may arise and with free, uplifted mind shake off that old bondage that so long has kept you down.","""[12] And further how I shape my course so that I may in the same poet's words-- ""Pass my old age and not my honour lose, And, if I may, still serve the lyric Muse.","_Petrarch._ I am neither covetous nor inhuman enough to be without solicitude for my friends, especially for those whose virtue or deserts attach me to them, for it is those whom I admire, revere, love, and compassionate; but, on the other hand, I do not pretend to be generous enough to court my own ruin for the sake of my friends.","""[9] Many other things shall I say to myself, as one in a fever whose mind every chance impression carries hither and thither in his fear; and then I go talking strangely to my friends, weeping and making them weep, and then presently after this we shall return to what we were before.","But if in past days my feelings were other than they are now, love and youth were the cause.","Go on, I beseech you, with what you have begun.","Augustine._ You are quite right, but redouble your efforts; and, as men wounded and fallen in battle raise themselves on their elbow, so do you keep a look out on all sides for the dangers that beset you, for fear that some foe; unseen come near and do you hurt yet more, where you lie on the ground.",One might say your case is just that of the young man who complained to Socrates that he had been a tour and it had done him no good whatever.,Remember what you are now called to is that citadel wherein alone you can be quite safe against the incursions of passion and by which alone you will deserve the name of Man.,So you may as well give up tormenting me.,"Augustine._ I feel there is still something you would like to urge, even now.","_Petrarch._ No, but of cupidity, and I do not believe there is a man in the world more free of this fault than myself.","[11] Horace, _Odes_, i.","""[49] For myself, perhaps I will declare what I think on the subject at some other time and place.",_S.,"_Petrarch._ Pray what have I done that you should desire to relieve me of the finest passions of my nature, and condemn to everlasting darkness the clearest faculties of my soul?","You lament having lighted on a place so unfavourable for study, for as the same poet says--     ""Bards fly from town, and haunt the wood and glade.","""[45] _S.",_S.,"We travel many ways to the same end, and, believe me, though you have left the road worn by feet of the crowd, you still direct your feet by a side-path towards this same ambition that you say you have thought scorn of; it is repose, solitude, a total disregard of human affairs, yes, and your own activities also, which just at present take you along that chosen path, but the end and object is glory.",_S.,"_Petrarch._ Yes, I agree he speaks truth, but if you notice he is speaking not of one who already has done with love, but of one who wishes to have done with it.","If both kind of life had one and the same end, I do not see why he should not be counted the happier who enjoys the present time and puts off affliction to another day, rather than the man who neither enjoys the present nor looks for any joy hereafter; unless you are perhaps moved by this consideration that in the end the laughter of the former will be changed to more bitter tears?",_Petrarch._ I pray you make no rash judgment.,"""[68] As you see them hasten to their setting in the west, think how you also are moving with them; and that as for your abiding you have no hope, saving only in Him who knows no change and suffers no decline.","""[4] Though I might multiply examples, yet I will rather content myself with this alone, that we might almost reckon as belonging to ourselves, and so all the more likely to come home.","Yes, you yourself with blinded eyes keep looking at your bonds; but, oh strange delusion!","[28] _Æneid_, ii.","I know that, more than to other lands, your heart turns to Italy, and that a love of your native soil is inborn in you; and you are right, for--     ""Not Media's forests rich, nor Ganges' stream,     Though fair it be, nor Hermus rolling gold,     May vie with Italy; Bactria and Ind,     And all Pachaia with its odours rare     Shall not be mentioned.","You might have known that I have loved her physical charm loss than her soul, that what has captivated me has been a life above that of ordinary lives, the witnessing of which has shown me how the blessed live above.",_S.,"Of a truth not longer did Italy once suffer the assaults of her most famous enemy, the great Hannibal; nor did she then endure more frequent onsets of her would-be lover, nor was consumed with more furious fires.","But let us hope for a year at least; on which, if we are still to follow Cicero, even the most aged reckons!",Augustine._ Do you mind giving me some example to confirm the view you have put forward?,"That as it is true no man ever fell involuntarily, so this also is true that countless numbers of those who thus are voluntarily fallen, nevertheless do not voluntarily remain so.","_Petrarch._ You may be sure I will so do, for I feel that, owing to your good counsels, I have been set free from a large part of my distress, and am therefore the better disposed to listen to what you may still have to say.",_S.,Augustine_.,_S.,"And so Virgil's simile has many a time come home to my heart,--     ""E'en as the stricken deer, that unaware     Rooming afar in pleasant groves of Crete,     The hunter pierces with his weapon keen.","""[17] And so you have made an ant your mentor and you are as excusable as the satiric poet who wrote--     ""Some people, like the ant, fear hunger and cold,""[18] but if you are going to put no limit to the following of ants, you will discover that there is nothing more melancholy and nothing more absurd than to ward off poverty one day by loading yourself with it all your days.","Consider, then, first how noble a thing is the soul, and that so great is it that were I to discourse as I should wish, I must needs make a whole book thereon.","_Petrarch._ Yes, truly, a very bad one.","_Petrarch._ Well, I may tell you that in spite of that I will suppose it no more, if you prove to me that my supposition was a false one.","""[33] Always in a state of suspense, always uncertain of the future, Fortune's favours have no attraction for me.","But to make the task of dividing the matter easier, I will examine each point in detail.",21.,We must meditate with attention thereon.,"If you have other remedy to offer me, I beg you withhold it not from him who is in need.","When you not only know all the testimony of the ancients, but have yourself proved the evils of solitude, it astonishes me that you should commit such a blunder as to seek it.",132.,Augustine_.,But the stars in their courses will not so fight against me as to prevent the order of Nature by hastening her death like that.,_S.,"""[24] Often in reflecting on this heavenly genius it has appeared to me an injustice when the disciples of Pythagoras dispense their chief from submitting proofs, that Plato should be supposed to have less liberty than he.",_Petrarch._ What!,I make no such demand on you as that.,"_Petrarch._ What would you have me say, except what was said by Domitian the Emperor, ""With even mind I brook the sight of watching, though still young, my hairs grow grey.","His youth, his beauty, his strength have brought him no help."
