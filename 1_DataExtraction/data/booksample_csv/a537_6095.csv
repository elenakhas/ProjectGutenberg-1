"He answered me at first with procrastinations, declaring, from time to time, he would mention it to my father; and still excusing himself for not doing it.",--In this manner he ran on almost a quarter of an hour before he would suffer me to speak.,"The reader may easily believe she was on no account pleased with Amelia's presence; indeed, she expected from her some of those insults of which virtuous women are generally so liberal to a frail sister: but she was mistaken; Amelia was not one      Who thought the nation ne'er would thrive,      Till all the whores were burnt alive.","Booth here made a low bow, and cried, ""O dear madam, how ignorant was I of my own happiness!""","Vanity is always contemptible; but when joined with dishonesty, it becomes odious and detestable.","How can she, then, be otherwise than surprized at your present demand?","However, the mirth of the rest, and a pretty liberal quantity of punch, which he swallowed after dinner (for Miss Matthews had ordered a very large bowl at her own expense to entertain the good company at her farewell), so far exhilarated his spirits, that when the young lady and he retired to their tea he had all the marks of gayety in his countenance, and his eyes sparkled with good humour.","""_Tace_, madam,"" answered Murphy, ""is Latin for a candle: I commend your prudence.","Here they fell immediately to commenting on the foregoing discourse; but, as their comments were, I believe, the same with what most readers have made on the same occasion, we shall omit them.","Spite, therefore, was the only motive to this cruel depredation; and indeed her behaviour on the occasion sufficiently convinced us both of the justice of our suspicion, though we neither of us durst accuse her; and she herself had the assurance to insist very strongly (though she could not prevail) with Amelia to turn away her innocent maid, saying, she would not live in the house with a thief.""","She would then repeat the compliments which others had made to her own beauty, and could not forbear once crying out, ""Upon my soul, my dear Billy, I believe the chief disadvantage on my side is my superior fondness; for love, in the minds of men, hath one quality, at least, of a fever, which is to prefer coldness in the object.","""About a month after the accident, when Amelia began to see company in a mask, I had the honour to drink tea with her.","The man assured Booth that he had made no mistake; saying, ""If your name is Booth, sir, I am positive you are the gentleman to whom the parcel I gave you belongs.""","""Oh!","--""No, my dear child,"" said the mother; ""he is the best man in the world, and therefore they hate him.""","I shook the major by the hand, and told him I not only forgave him, but was extremely obliged to his friendship; and then, going to the fryar, I found that he was Bagillard's confessor, from whom he came to me, with an earnest desire of seeing me, that he might ask my pardon and receive my forgiveness before he died for the injury he had intended me.","""'Who calls the wretched thing that was Alphonso?'",That look of yours frightens me to death.',"After a short pause of a few moments, he answered, with great solemnity, as follows: ""Young man, I am entirely unconcerned at your groundless suspicion.","Come, madam, do not be discouraged; a bit of manslaughter and cold iron, I hope, will be the worst: or perhaps we may come off better with a slice of chance-medley, or _se defendendo_"" ""I am very ignorant of the law, sir,"" cries the lady.","""To confess the truth, I am afraid we often compliment what we call upper life, with too much injustice, at the expense of the lower.",there is no true tenderness but in a woman of spirit.,"to hear this, and at the same time to see the poor delirious creature deriving the greatest horrors from my sight, and mistaking me for a highwayman who had a little before robbed her.","He then asked me if I had any prospect of going again into the army; if not, what scheme of life I proposed to myself?","answered the governor, as soon as he had recovered his breath, for it almost forsook him at the sight of the black word hundred--""No, no; there might be people indeed--but I am not one of those.","Such rises we often see in life, without being able to give any satisfactory account of the means, and therefore ascribe them to the good fortune of the person.","To this the other answered (I am sure I repeat her words, though I cannot mimic either the voice or air with which they were spoken)--'Pray, Miss Emily, which is to be the judge, yourself or that gentleman?","And this experiments he thought, would confirm him either in a good or evil opinion of that gentleman.","""When the major was drest his sister seemed to possess his whole thoughts, and all his care was to relieve her grief.","However, I will tell you this: the lawyer and Mr. Robinson have been laying their heads together about you above half an hour this afternoon.","""Fy, sir,"" answered Murphy; ""you know I hate all this; but, if the lady will trust me with her cause, I will do the best in my power.","However, I now revived this in my mind, which I artificially worked up into so high an injury, that I assure you it afforded me no little comfort.","""I now, for many days, endured the greatest torments which the human mind is, I believe, capable of feeling; and I can honestly say I tried all the means, and applied every argument which I could raise, to cure me of my love.","As to perjuries in civil matters, they are not so very criminal.""","To say the truth, if all which unwittingly dropt from Miss Matthews was put together, some conclusions might, it seems, be drawn from the whole, which could not convey a very agreeable idea to a constant husband.","Tenderness for women is so far from lessening, that it proves a true manly character.","""Well, madam, after a lecture of about a quarter of an hour's duration from Mrs. Harris, I suffered her to conduct me to the outward gate of her court-yard, whence I set forward in a disconsolate condition of mind towards my lodgings.","I was highly pleased with this answer, in which I thought I could discover both sense and spirit.",Is this a time for me to mention a thing of this kind to your father?',"""After a restless and sleepless night, when I rose the next morning I had the comfort to receive a visit from the woman of the house, who, after a very short introduction, asked me when I had heard from the captain, and when I expected to see him?",do I say?,"I do assure you I would offer him no less was it my own case.""","if I die, will you not have escaped the horrors of a parting ten thousand times more dreadful than this?","replied the child, ""for I am sure he is very good.""","Booth told her he had heard some such thing himself, and then continued his story as in the next chapter.","I had just taken a lodging in the verge of the court, and had writ my dear Amelia word where she might find me, when she had settled her affairs in the best manner she could.","Indeed, women cannot be cautioned too much against such lovers; for though I have heard, and perhaps truly, of some of our sex, of a virtue so exalted, that it is proof against every temptation; yet the generality, I am afraid, are too much in the power of a man to whom they have owned an affection.","--She then forced the poor, trembling, fainting Amelia out of the room; which when she had done, she began very coolly to reason with me on the folly, as well as iniquity, which I had been guilty of; and repeated to me almost every word I had before urged to her daughter.","And so well bred was the good woman, that we could scarce get her out of the room the whole night.","[Illustration: She then gave a loose to her passions] ""What do you hear?""","Amelia turned pale as death at these words; indeed, I feared she would have fainted, if I could be said to fear, who had scarce any of my senses left, and was in a condition little better than my angel's.","Booth was then satisfied that Mr. Robinson, whom he did not yet know by name, was the gamester who had won his money at play.","There was time, however, for the boat to pass and repass; so that, when we came to call over names, three only, of all that remained in the ship after the loss of her own boat, were missing.","These fatigues, added to the uneasiness of her mind, overpowered her weak spirits, and threw her into one of the worst disorders that can possibly attend a woman; a disorder very common among the ladies, and our physicians have not agreed upon its name.",He is indeed one of the worthiest men the world ever produced.,"She then put a bank-bill of a hundred pounds into Mr. Booth's hands, and asked him with a smile if he did not think she had reason to be offended with so much insolence?","""Pardon me, madam,"" answered Booth; ""I hope you do not agree with Mandevil neither, who hath represented human nature in a picture of the highest deformity.","I hope I am not to take up my lodging with these creatures.""","""Fellow!""",This faithful creature came into the hall with the footman who had driven the cart.,"Well, whoever writ it is a matter very immaterial; yet, as it seemed so odd and unaccountable an incident, I could not help mentioning it.",Thus did this generous colonel (for generous he really was to the highest degree) restore peace and comfort to this little family; and by this act of beneficence make two of the worthiest people two of the happiest that evening.,"are glory and fame, and not his Amelia, the happiness of my husband?",What this was the reader shall know in the next chapter.,"To triumph over the widow, for whom I had in a very short time contracted a most inveterate hatred, was a pride not to be described.","""Oh!",it would be so still--why can't my Billy think so?,"""After a scene,"" continued he, ""too tender to be conceived by many, Amelia informed me that she had received a letter from an unknown hand, acquainting her with my misfortune, and advising her, if she ever desired to see me more, to come directly to Gibraltar.","When Amelia therefore perceived the visible confusion in Miss Matthews she presently called to remembrance some stories which she had imperfectly heard; for, as she was not naturally attentive to scandal, and had kept very little company since her return to England, she was far from being a mistress of the lady's whole history.","She therefore sent a kind note to her the moment of our arrival, giving her her option, whether she would come to us at the inn, or whether we should that evening wait on her.",did you not even get drunk in the time of your wife's delivery?,"Abroad I scarce ever went, lest I should meet any of my former acquaintance;

S._ ""Though I am now on my return home, I have taken up my pen to communicate to you some news I have heard from England, which gives me much uneasiness, and concerning which I can indeed deliver my sentiments with much more ease this way than any other.","I lost my former bed-fellow, my sister, and-- you may, I think, guess the rest--the villain found means to steal to my chamber, and I was undone.","""Our amour had already been buzzed all over the town; and it came at last to the ears of Mrs. Harris: I had, indeed, observed of late a great alteration in that lady's behaviour towards me whenever I visited at the house; nor could I, for a long time before this evening, ever obtain a private interview with Amelia; and now, it seems, I owed it to her mother's intention of overhearing all that passed between us.","So many tender ideas crowded at once into my mind, that, if I may use the expression, they almost dissolved my heart.","I knocked softly at the door, and being bid to open it, I found the major in his sister's ante-chamber warming her posset.","""We went hence to pay a visit to Miss Harris, whose reception of us was, I think, truly ridiculous; and, as you know the lady, I will endeavour to describe it particularly."
