"""No!""","Murder was in his heart, and the urge to break this tough guy Fenton with his bare hands.",The lanky scientist outlined the further details of his plan in swift whispers while he worked with the energizing capsule of Luke's garment.,"""Sure your friends'll be there?""","I discovered that this radioactivity can be used to defeat the purpose of the neutro-rays as well or better than the regular insulation, which, of course, we can not obtain.","He did not even wince, but swiftly lashed out with a bony fist, raking Luke's cheek with sharp knuckles.",What he said was true.,Kulan fingered the black tube of his neutro-beam and his broad face was chalky white.,"""One more day in this place and it'll be too late for me.""",And the work of reallotting squads went on.,had already progressed to such a point that it was hardly possible he could recover.,"""Five days in the sealed cell; ten altogether in the Workshop.""","And then Gannett whirled to look over the mess tables, whence a few scattered hisses had arisen.","This Kulan, a head over him in stature and broad in proportion, was sure in his mind that he could handle the red-headed Earthman without resort to weapons.","The runway, he observed, was a strip of yielding metal that glowed faintly with an unnatural greenish light.",That all feeling had left his limbs in the deep-biting cold meant nothing; that his lungs were near bursting under the terrific strain meant even less.,And the chief guard's dart gun twanged as its needlelike missile sped forth and drove into the sick man's breast where it sang its shrill song of vibratory dissolution.,But you can carry on the work; go to my friends and tell them--everything.,And the longer his thoughts dwelt upon the things Fuller had told him the more suspicious he became.,There was no way of beating the authorities at this game.,"""You, Fenton,"" he snapped, ""ten paces forward.""",They stood erect and moved freely among the prisoners who sprawled everywhere in grotesque squashed heaps.,Then a light beam flashed forth from the black tube and Luke sagged down with an astonished oath squeezed grunting from his throat.,"""Certainly they will; they've been waiting two days.""",It was sheer baiting of the big Martian.,"""You ain't figurin' on gettin' out to-day?""","With my hands.""","""It'll be good for discipline.","Luke did comprehend, even though the technical explanation was beyond his understanding.",The bond between them strengthened.,"Luke turned his head, but could see nothing of their pursuers.","Luke stared, horrified.",Here was courage of a kind he never had encountered; here a man in whose bright eyes fearlessness and defiance mingled with a cool disdain that brought the first real feeling of inferiority Luke ever had experienced.,I'm licked.,"Kulan, the big Martian, selected Luke.",He dived head foremost into a rectangular wooden trough that was used for the disposal of the gangue from a crushing mill above.,And the cold was unbelievably intense.,Luke pondered this.,"We merely pack a quantity of the radioactive salt around the capsules in the lining of our garments, and the radium emanations continue the excitation of the tiny atomic generators even under the influence of the neutralizing vibrations.","""Mean to tell me you----"" ""I had a reason to get in here,"" Fuller broke in mildly.",Then Luke drove a hard fist to his jaw--a pulled punch so as not to betray his real strength.,In both cases vibratory ether waves are sent out and these are of such frequency and wave form as to neutralize the anti-gravity energies originating in our capsules.,"With the radium.""",The liberation of the tiny planet and consequent shifting of the terminator was bringing frigidity to Vulcan's Workshop.,But the loud yelling of guards back there in the pit gave evidence that word of the escape was being passed along to Gannett.,"There was a faint pungent odor in the air of the room, a new smell that widened Luke's nostrils and caught at his throat and lungs.","They're completely fooled, and we'll be well on our way before they know the truth.""","Reeling and stumbling, his leg and back muscles shot through with stabbing pain as the frost worked slowly upward, Luke plodded doggedly ahead.","""You'll last another period,"" he snarled.","""I'll run him, you mean.",His back straightened and Fuller was swung clear of the ground.,"With legs spread wide and with sweat oozing from every pore, he heaved himself erect, straightening knees and spine and standing there firmly on his two feet.","Great massed flakes falling endlessly--the moisture of the mist crystallized and closing in on him to hide him even more safely, than had the mists themselves.",A strangely grotesque heap was at his feet--Tom Fuller.,"They'll send out the alarm and----"" ""Ah, that is where we fool them, Fenton.",That working period was a highly gratifying one to Luke.,"They render our suits useless, but those of the guards are provided with insulating coverings which block off the waves and thus permit their own garments to function even when the neutro-broadcast is in operation.""","And yet, these smart guys Luke always had detested--the doctors and surgeons and such--they might be able to do something for the poor devil.",Yet there was no cessation of that awful weight when the thing was done.,"Laughing derisively, he completed his ten paces with leisurely aplomb.",And yet he was content to bide his time.,Fuller's tone was impatient and his words came painfully.,"In spite of all this, man has persisted in establishing himself in the vapor belt of Vulcan for the sake of wresting from the rocky soil its vast deposits of rare ores, and a great number of mining operations are continually in progress.",There was a new and utterly unaccountable huskiness in his voice as he straddled the prone body and locked his strong fingers underneath.,"You can get away yourself, alive.","Anyway, he determined, he'd get the scientist to his friends dead or alive, and he'd see to it that they treated him right.","In the ominous silence a cracked voice yelped: ""Attaboy Fenton!""",There was much bitterness in the scientist's refusal to dwell on this point.,Luke grinned but made no move.,"""It's a trick.","The missile, in passing, had carried away the belt and part of the fabric of Tom's garment--carried away the capsule and the radium that energized it.","As agreed, Tom Fuller came out first and Luke held back, dragging his feet and cursing softly to himself.","Its periods of rotation and revolution are equal, so that it always presents the same face toward the solar system's great center of heat and light--for which reason one side is terrifically hot and the other, that facing into outer space, unbearably cold.","""That's right, you big ape,"" he grated, ""you ain't man enough to fight the way men fight.",An occasional shout came from far behind where the guards still searched the rocky plateau.,"Still he hung back, scarcely moving from where he stood just within the door.","After three red-lit days of grueling labor and three similarly red-lit nights of listening to Novak, he reached the grudging conclusion that escape from this place was impossible.",Luke stood swaying on those spreadeagled legs and his lungs were near bursting from the exertion in the noxious atmosphere.,And he'd try to keep it so.,"Eyeing Luke suspiciously, the senior guard grunted, then moved on along the line.","he protested, ""No unnecessary killing, Fenton.","Tell them what you saw back there--tell them----"" ""Shut up!""","Immediately there was the raucous call of the general alarm siren and a flashing light from the bastion that paled the red mists to a sickly, luminous pink."
