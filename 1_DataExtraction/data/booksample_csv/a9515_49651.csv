"I have power enough to see to that.""","Tedric roared, in such a voice that not a man moved.","""Sergeant, you will bear my sword and hammer.",A full company of the Royal Guard was already there.,"""Just barely, sire, but in time.""",Such conduct is very unseemly--decidedly ungodlike.,"*       *       *       *       * ""They come, master, to the number of eleven,"" his lookout boy came running with news at mid-afternoon of the seventh day.","Seize him, men, and smash that image!""",He studied the enemy formation briefly.,"You just said, yourself, that his image was made of stone and copper and ..."" ""Don't be silly, Lord.","Equally thoroughly, however, he believed in the actuality and in the power of Tedric's new god.",You will be my only god as long as I live.,He called in his henchmen and issued orders.,Two more to go.,All others of his ilk will die ere this day's sunset.,"Gods of the ancients, what a woman!","That there is to be no more of it, even to you?","Just stiff.""","No slave, or any number of slaves, would do.","Tedric's eyes flamed more savagely, his terrifically muscled body tensed.","While Sarpedion had not appeared personally in Devann's lifetime, he had so appeared many times in the past; and by a sufficiently attractive sacrifice he could be persuaded to appear again, particularly since this appearance would be in self-defense.","Then, deciding that the proposed victim could not be taken alive, he led his crew back the way they had come, trailing fiery threats.","Copper is no good, I cannot harden it enough.","""This furnace must stay this hot all day and all of tonight, and there are other things as bad.","Your wrought iron is beautiful stuff; so is your white cast iron; and you would not, ordinarily, in your lifetime, come to know anything of either carburization or high-alloy steel, to say nothing of both.",Why?,"That worthy did, with longing; to buy it would take six months of a foreman's pay.","And most or all of those runty little slavelings behind you,"" waving his left arm contemptuously at the group, ""will also die before they cut me down.","And with the head, any resemblance at all to Skandos ceased.","Take that biggest chunk of 'metal-which-fell-from-the-sky'--you'll find it's about twice your weight ..."" ""But I have never been able to work that particular piece of metal, Lord.""","""Wrong?","They must be so because I will have to cut my way alone through a throng of armed and armored mercenaries and priests.""","This armor I wear is not of iron, but of god-metal, the metal of Llosir, my personal and all-powerful god.","And of the black ore of which you have occasionally used a little, one-fourth of your weight ..."" The instructions went on, from ore to finished product in complete detail, and at its end: ""If you follow these directions carefully you will have a high-alloy-steel--chrome-nickel-vanadium-molybdenum-tungsten steel, to be exact--case-hardened and heat-treated; exactly what you need.","Then, during the hours of lull, in which there was nothing much to do except keep the furious fires fed, Tedric worked upon the image of his god.","Slay me those traitor priests before they slay Rhoann and you may...."" Tedric did not hear the rest of it, nor was his mind chiefly concerned with the plight of the royal maid.","That done, he turned to the altar--he had not even glanced at it before.","*       *       *       *       * Thus it came about that a towering figure clad in flashing golden armor--the king himself, with a few courtiers scrambling far in his wake--dashed up the last few steps just as Tedric was wrenching out Sarpedion's liver.","""'Twould be better,"" the monarch agreed.","Nevertheless the attackers pressed forward; and, even though each blow of his devastating sword took a life, Tedric was forced backward up the stairs, step by step.","Reaching the Temple of Scheene, he found to his immense relief that he would not have to storm that heavily-manned rampart alone.",Still no damage.,"""I said _strike_!""","On his left, beyond the stairwell, the wall was equally solid for twice as far.","Besides, the image might make it easier for me to call on you in time of need.""","Her eyes went from shattered image to blood-covered armored giant and back to image; her face was a study of part-horrified, part-terrified, part-worshipful amazement.",That is final.,"He fitted the two-hand grip meticulously with worked and tempered rawhide, thrilling again and again as each touch of an educated and talented finger-tip told him over and over that here was some thing brand new in metal--a real god-metal.","""HOLD!""","Time runneth short, but I would stay and oblige if pressed.""","This first swing, horizontal and neck-high, was fully as fierce-driven as the one that had cloven the test-piece and almost ruined his testing-block.","There was a brief silence, then: ""To what do I owe the honor of this visit, priest?""",How can we of Lomarr _ever_ attain comfort and happiness if more die each year than are born?,"""Perhaps; but I have blasphemed before and Sarpedion hasn't killed me yet.","""Make him Lord of the Marches, father,"" the girl said, sharply.","It probably wasn't too late yet, but the sooner he got there, the better would be his chance of winning.","Hence, when the minions of Sarpedion next appeared, armored this time in the heaviest and best iron they had and all set to overwhelm him by sheer weight of numbers, he was completely ready.","""Sarpedion will be enough.","In fact, except for the noise, they scarcely bothered him.",A burly captain disentangled himself from the front rank and saluted.,"Good--they weren't worried enough about him yet, then, to send a big one.","I've just killed Sarpedion, right here.""","Come what may of god or devil you need not fear it, for I and all with me fight under Llosir's shield.",The rest of you will ram me into the center of that phalanx with everything of driving force that in you lies.,"He should have thought of that himself, sooner, damn him for a fool!","He had never struck such a blow before, except possibly with a war-axe or a sledge.","Can you remember them all?""","""Good!",Work with me until this iron is made and I give you that sword.,We'll go into details later.,"Ordinary meteorites are nickel-iron, but this one carries two additional and highly unusual elements, tungsten and vanadium, which are necessary for our purpose.",Ah ... the king's daughter.... At the thought the pit of his stomach turned cold.,But 'twill not take long.,"""I thank you, sire.","Wherefore the next blow, a vertical chop, merely split a man to the chin instead of to the navel: and the third, a back-hand return, didn't quite cut the victim's head clear off.",See to it that nothing ever does change it.,"We will offer you anything else--_anything_ else--but not even your refusal to give me the god-metal will change my stand on that.""","When those links are broken, by fire and sacrifice, the god may not exactly die, but he can do no more of harm until his priests have made a new image and spent much time and effort in building up new linkages.","""I'll take the three at the altar--you fellows take the rest of them!""","Think, then; that will do just as well.","I will be glad to make you my son.""","""You know better than to ask that question, priest.","He bent his mighty back to the crank, but even in that raging inferno of heat he kept on talking."
