He scratched his head again.,Among the imprisoned hours as we choose....,"He stood a moment, shaking the extras of the night from hair and clothing, then laughed with a sound like running water as the birds swooped down and carried the straws and twigs away with a great business of wings.","Sunshine, colour, and perfume filled the room to overflowing, yet not so full that there was not ample space for the ""somebody"" who had brought them.",The Gardener replied without his usual hesitation.,asked Tim in a whisper.,"""You are both well aware,"" Aunt Emily went on, ignoring their excuses as in duty bound, ""that your parents would not approve.",Delicate threads like nerves run through it everywhere.,Where the rain-drops 'ides theirselves on getting down and the grubs keeps secret till they feel their wings.,Judy made a movement like a swan that inspects the world behind its back.,"""We're lost,"" said Tim bluntly, turning round and round.",Then he sat up and stared at her.,"Profoundly satisfied with himself, he looked round at his bedraggled Uncle.",Now everything could come true.,"Then, remembering vaguely that he expected somebody or something out of the ordinary, he made a peculiar noise that seemed to meet the case: he tried to whistle at it.",This mere description told her nothing real.,she declared with energy.,He realised the uselessness of words.,"Then, as the trio of humans stared with delight, they saw another guest arrive and dance up gaily to the feast.","One was that the clocks had stopped for twenty-four hours and that an extra, unused day was dawning; another, that To-day was Sunday.",Leaves and twigs don't care about being blown when there's no one there to see them.,"""Uncle, you've been arguing.","""Then what's an orgully occasion?""",He stared at Judy and his uncle.,"""Hiding, is he?""","Better look out!""","""It's a lovely morning,"" continued Judy politely, smiling at the empty place.","Then Judy suddenly nudged Tim, and Tim nudged Uncle Felix, and Uncle Felix dug his elbow into Come-Back Stumper, and Stumper somehow or other caught the attention of the Tramp--a sort of panting sound, half-whistle and half-gasp.","And she was singing to herself in a thin but happy voice that was not unlike an old and throaty corncrake: ""The birds are singing....Hark!","Aunt Emily glanced up from her ferns, nodded and said, ""Good morning, it's a lovely day""--and resumed her digging again.","""Hm"" he murmured softly once again, then heard a sound of wings rush whirring past his face, and next a chattering of birds somewhere overhead among the heavy eaves.","It was in a tropical jungle, where the foliage was so thick that the sunlight hardly penetrated at all.","""What has he done?""",No grown-up could have been more thoughtful of his welfare than she was.,"It was a self-repeater--of some violence, moreover, when the smallness of the hero is considered.",In a night the lawns turned white.,"They caught the wind, they held the sunset and the dawn; they turned the air into a shining garden.","It's natural to sing, and natural to dance--when you're alive and looking--and know it.""","""When I was young,"" he said, with an expression half quizzical, half yearning.",She tried to hide the mellowness by swallowing it.,"""It's outside.",The trees miraculously opened up a way for them as they dived and stooped and wriggled forward.,Judy and Tim were prancing wildly.,"""It's a woman with sad, black eyes,"" thought Tim, ""that's how I like it.""",But another vaster sound lay underneath.,"He was a dear old thing, whatever happened.","Then added, with the first touch of awe about him, ""It has no centre.""",But he kept his secret about the robin tightly in its hiding-place.,"""Why, he's not only passed this way--he's actually touched it.",He moved a step nearer.,"The children felt the danger in the air, and watched their uncle with quivering admiration.","""That is why,"" he replied pathetically.",Listen a moment!,"""Could,"" he added.","When they had eaten and drunk, they, too, would come and join the search.","The effort exhausted him, it seemed.","""Master Tim goes poking along the ground, looking for something with his feet.",She was contented where she was.,He straightened up and looked with an air of respectful candour at the others.,"""_He_ ought to be with us, too,"" said Judy, looking back.","""The fact is,"" stammered Uncle Felix, ""you're so like the rest of the garden--so like a bit of the garden, I mean--that we didn't notice you at first.","Is that why--?""","""Birds can rise above everything--and so can I!""","Their mischief, moreover, is not revenge, though some might think it so--but a natural desire to be recognised and thought and talked about a little.","Anything passing across it at such a moment, whether insect, bird, loose leaf or even human being, would be aware of this, and thus, for a fleeting second, share another world.","In Stumper's case their interest had waned, they felt they had been cheated somehow, they knew themselves defeated and had given up the search.",she whispered.,"A few, however, set to work to discover what it was.",No one had noticed it before.,"It was familiar enough to all of them, yet marvellous.","They stood and watched the spade; it went in with a crunching sound; it came out slowly with a sort of ""pouf,"" and a load of rich, black earth slid off it into the world of sunshine.","Some lived in a room and read hundreds of books;
