For more than a century now, planet time, they had been fighting their queer, twisted war among the stars.","And, fearing that the stranger might win free and disappear, the Terran spotlighted the captive in the beam, reckless of Throg or enemy reinforcements.","There were no dreams, nothing but an unconsciousness which even a Throg attack could not have pierced.",And if his plans went through--and hope does not die easily--then this time he would not waste his labor either.,Her profile reminded Shann of something for an instant; but it should have been golden-yellow instead of silver with two jeweled patterns ringing the snout.,"""Supplies?""",And it was that need which forced him at last into action.,For the general loot of a Survey field camp would be relatively worthless to those who picked over the treasure of entire cities elsewhere.,"""It's regulation, isn't it?""","Now, with three of them at the digging, the brown hump was uncovered, and Shann pried down around its edge, trying to lever it up and over.",Water!,The Throg must be coming to him.,"Shann sat down in the sand, hardly daring to breathe.","But an adult Throg, even unarmed, was not to be considered easy meat, Shann thought.","Thorvald must have rounded the south point of land and be very close to the reef passage, perhaps through it by now.","The Terran was certain that his opponent would be on the scene somewhere when he was led, dreaming, to destroy his work once more.",Both of us were on water--water which had an eventual connection with the sea.,"They had the creature almost clear now, though the shell still rested firmly on the ground, and they had no notion of what it might protect.","Then, as if a knife slashed, the hum of that contact was gone.","""My dream----"" Shann said.",And Warlock itself was a fact.,Then some of the strain smoothed out of the gaunt features and Thorvald laughed softly.,He might have been surveying a submerged world.,They merely stood watching him.,"Shann had tasted loneliness in the mountains, experienced the strange world of the river at night lighted by the wan radiance of glowing shrubs and plants, forced the starkness of the heights.","If we have to convince some stubborn females, as well as fight Throgs, well""--he shrugged--""we'll have a busy, busy, time.""","Did you not also break free from the power of the disk when I led you by the underground ways, awaking in the river?","""The unreal can be mighty real--here.""","I want to have a breathing spell before I have to play quarry in one of their hunts.""","And could the Survey officer now be caught in Shann's dream in turn, climbing up somewhere into the nose slit of a skull-shaped mountain?","""Well, if we strike away from here, we'll just get right back in again.""","He smiled, his amusement growing--not aimed at his companion on this cliff top, but at himself.","We have sought for that, but there has been no communication between us, neither of mind nor of voice.""",But Shann did not protest.,"""It would seem, Readers-of-the-rods""--the middle one of the triumvirate at the table spoke now--""that all living things do not follow our pattern of life.","We've always considered the ones we fight to be males, but they might just as possibly be amazons.","He glanced up, discovered the other surveying him critically.",Or what he awaited?,"But maybe we can really lick it now.""","Perhaps, if he were very lucky, he could knock the other from his clawed feet.",The source of the green shimmer lay to his left.,Thorvald caught at Shann's arm.,The wolverines backed from jaws which snapped fruitlessly.,"And he was a prisoner along with the wolverines, a prisoner on an island which was half the size of the valley which held the Survey camp.",He was fast losing that sense of well being which had been his during his travels through the fog; a fatigue tugged at his arms and weighed leaden on his shoulders.,"They had hoped for some exit from the territory of the veil, but now they faced a solid slab of dark stone, neither a conventional exit or entrance, as they proved by circling its base.","And again, oddly enough, he was not irritated by this unconscious arrogance; rather he was intrigued and amused.","""Now what, or where?"""
