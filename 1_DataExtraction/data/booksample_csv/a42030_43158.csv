she could not, except under great stress of feeling, discuss the matter with Emberance, and of her mother's stern, clear view she had an instinctive dread.","""Katharine has never had any troubles, and she is naturally lively,"" returned Emberance.","""And why do you like Kingsworth better than Applehurst?""","said Mrs Kingsworth to herself with slower tears than Katharine's rising in her eyes, ""yet I suppose her wishes are natural.""",Malcolm Mackenzie had replied that she herself could never disappoint him.,"Her vague misgivings were painfully realised, yet having often experienced her mother's severe judgment, she took refuge in a sort of instinctive doubt of the truth of her impressions.","""Rectify it?","Katharine looked grave, but with the dutiful solemnity of a child, inwardly every pulse was dancing, and when her uncle left her she stood for a minute, then with a spring and a cry that she could hardly repress, went dancing down the garden-path, clapping her hands together.",It was a bitter experience even if it might have been bitterer still.,Yet she should like to know how the situation would strike Walter.,"""It is close upon eight o'clock,"" she said, ""what can keep them?""",I couldn't keep it--and _she_ to be unhappy.,"It's not a bad prospect--for these days, uncle,"" said Emberance, with a sort of imploring simplicity, ""and his family is just as good as mine.","But then, there was no one to speak to, and as to going to a ball, I never _dreamed_ of such a thing.","""I won't.","When will they come?""","As it was, the poor child jarred her mother with every taste and turn that she developed.","And of course we know that we must wait,"" said the girl, timidly, but with firmness.","""I shall like to see it, pretty or ugly,"" said her cousin as the music struck up again and Kate's partner came to claim her.","She had turned down a lane that led away from the sea;
