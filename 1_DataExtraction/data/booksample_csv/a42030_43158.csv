"Are you going to have another blackberrying to-morrow?""","She blushed and then continued laughing: ""But you know, Major Clare, we are simple-minded country girls, and we do enjoy picking blackberries.","Oh, Emmy, I wouldn't keep it and leave you to want it, for all the world.""","Her mother has kept her away from Kingsworth, taking grudgingly the least advantage from her inheritance.",She says she was suspected of doing something wrong; but that it was not true.,"""But,"" said Katharine, ""mamma looked at me and the tears came into her eyes, and she said, as if she hated me, `So you can enjoy pleasures your cousin does not share,' and went away.""","said Walter, feeling himself in a great scrape.","""I do not know,"" she said, ""I do not know Katharine's feelings.",Emberance doesn't like to talk about the family.,"""That is something unusual.""","She did not ask any more questions, and her agitation subsided; while to her mother's intense disappointment, she said nothing more of what had passed.","Emberance was puzzled, she could not tell how the discovery had come about, and moreover, she guessed that the facts were more complicated than Kate supposed.",and I have always been shut up by myself!,Still she was enough disturbed by what had passed to resolve almost for the first time in her life on consulting Canon Kingsworth.,"The morning-room in which Kate was had been Mrs Kingsworth's favourite sitting-room long ago, and was as cheerful a room as any in the house, with white panels and a carved cornice, and long windows that looked towards the village.","""Did you, uncle?""","There was nothing very characteristic or picturesque about the class, they wore the ordinary dress of labouring women, except that their petticoats were very short, and they were generally as rough and ignorant as might be expected of the inhabitants of a place which had enjoyed so few advantages as Kingsworth.","The speaker was a tall young man of four or five and twenty, whose roundish dark eyes and hooked nose were sufficiently of the Kingsworth type to satisfy any one on the look-out for a family likeness, while his good looks and pleasant open expression were enough to account for the interest which Miss Deane was expressing in his presence at the ball; the large rooms at Mayford were all gay with lights and flowers, as the company began to assemble from all the country round, for the Deanes were popular people, and the ball a large one.",She _never_ walks on the shore.,"People are dead after seven years, you can marry somebody else even?""","""Dear Kitty, I hope you won't be very dull and unhappy, after I have gone.""","""My dear, dear child!""",The question was if it were worth keeping.,"""And what is your name?","Emberance had answered warmly, and Love Lane or Hatchard's Lane, as it was called, according to the tastes of the speaker, always brought her promise to her mind.","She was picking--and eating--blackberries with all her might, comparing her basket with her companions', scratching her fingers, and tearing her gown with the most entire enjoyment.","The Canon did not, she thought, write freely to her; she could not, except under great stress of feeling, discuss the matter with Emberance, and of her mother's stern, clear view she had an instinctive dread.",She turned away from the path towards the Vicarage; with a shy unwillingness to be met _there_ by herself; yet her thoughts as she walked along were not wrapped in the sunny haze proper to a young maiden just awaking to a sense of preference given and received.,"She looked up with that in her eyes, which, had he met them, must have brought the scene to a point at once, and given it a very different ending.","But remember, the time was so short that he may have   been only waiting for a favourable opportunity.","""Walter may have another opportunity of judging if he likes,"" said his father.","She liked attention, and, as a pretty half-grown girl, had met with a good deal; but she did not intend finally to yield except to an ideal youth, the colour of whose hair, and the expression of whose eyes had been accurately decided upon, while his admiration of herself was to be evident from their first meeting.",Walter could have bitten his tongue out for his imprudence.,She did not understand it.,"She could hardly grasp her own thought, to express it was still more difficult.","""Oh--because of friends,"" said Kate.","""But you will not retract, Katharine, you will not fall again into temptation?","""Will you dance with me, Miss Kingsworth?""","She was small and rather short, with the sort of birdlike air, always given by a delicately hooked nose, and round dark eyes set rather close together.","She was a tall woman, with a figure slender and _elance_ as that of a girl, delicate, regular features, and a small head adorned with an abundance of smooth, dark hair.",But Kate had not come to the point of perceiving that any particular line of action could be expected of her.,He has no one belonging to him to keep him in England.,"And he went, though somehow his sisters could extract no more enthusiasm from him on the subject of the south-country cousins.","She stopped a minute in her walk, and looked over the hedge across the cabbages in Hatchard's market garden, and said to herself,-- ""I'm not bearing it, I'm trying to escape it.","""Refused him?""",we shouldn't come to gather blackberries if they were of no use!,"""Dear, _dear_ Emmy, I _should_ like you to have one too,"" she said.","She was to go home in time for Christmas, and at home would be much more likely to pick up fragments of intelligence.",And mamma would not consent--so how could I get there?,"Emberance glanced at her, and said,-- ""Kitty, we mustn't stay for tea, it is so dark, let us go home.","Emberance found things pleasant enough, but she felt as if there were years of life between herself and her cousin, as she thought of Malcolm Mackenzie's ship tossing on the waves which never rose without costing her an unreasonable sense of apprehension.","""He would not have made any new will at all, but for that false report,"" said Mrs Kingsworth.","""I do not agree with you,"" said Mrs Kingsworth.",I am in a great perplexity.,"She knew that she could have borne anything cheerfully then, but to wait and have her life spoiled, and no hope of sharing his--Emberance cried and chafed, and, for the first time, wished that she was heiress of Kingsworth.","He had three or four miles to walk, through russet hedges, thick with hips and haws, and then over bleak and open downs till he came to the little fishing village running back into the shore in its green cove.",It is full of painful memories to your mothers and to me.,"High-mindedness was to be cultivated by a careful and sparing selection of poetry and romance; but this provoking Katharine at twelve years old borrowed the kitchen-maids Sunday-school prizes, and preferred them to the ""Lady of the Lake.""",And _now_ the evil of it is seen.,"""What?""","""What is your view about Kingsworth?""","sobbed Kate at last.--""Do the Clares.--Do people know?""",I got quite tired of the subject long ago.,"She had lived so secluded a life and was of so unpractical a nature herself, that while she anxiously speculated whether Kate was not too fond of dancing and of dress, she never guessed that the dress was beginning to be worn and the dance to be valued for something more than itself.","""I am sorry, Kate, but it cannot be.","""Emberance's father and mine were drowned,"" she thought, ""so mamma disliked the place for ever afterwards.","""I have no wish to know anything of Emberance,"" said Mrs Kingsworth, hastily, ""it is not for her sake I act, but,--well, if you think it might incline Katharine to what I wish.""",I think the family were too ready to take up an attitude of mystery about it.,"""I haven't been dull at all.""","""Ah, yes,"" he said more softly, ""letters would be very sweet; but still--we know we love each other, and that is so much to me, that nothing can ever put me out of heart.""","Mr George, _he_ was always a quiet one.""","""You can only say that she has round eyes,"" said Eva, one morning at breakfast, when the subject came up again, some weeks after Walter's visit to the south.","""It has come to us through ill-doing.""","""When your cousin kindly gave me Mrs Deane's invitation, he offered Kingsworth as an inducement, and I liked the idea of seeing it.",I won't hear of it.,"Her hair of a reddish chestnut was crisp and rough, her skin brilliantly fair and rosy, and her teeth white, and just perceptible beneath the short upper lip.","But I don't care about that.""","""I wish Kingsworth did not belong to you, Katharine, that you had no concern with it,"" said Walter, abruptly.","I do not know a more joyless face than Mrs Kingsworth's, and there is a stern unwillingness to identify herself with the place, which is very noticeable.""","She was too straightforward to have expected him to try again to ""deceive her,"" as she called it; but as she stood alone, and looked out towards the Vicarage, there came over the poor child all in a minute the weariest feeling of wishing that he had.","The white dresses, with white heather and fern leaves, promised to be equally becoming to Kate's vivid roses and chestnut locks, and to her cousin's blush-rose fairness and slender grace; and though Emberance was far the handsomer girl of the two, Katharine's chances were doubtless balanced by her heirship.","It was impossible that she should forget her former attempt at consulting Walter, and though he avoided the subject, her perceptions were not acute enough to discover this.","She had been open and honest, and she would have been a worse girl if she had stifled her instinct of telling Major Clare the truth, though she fancied now that she would have been a much happier one."
