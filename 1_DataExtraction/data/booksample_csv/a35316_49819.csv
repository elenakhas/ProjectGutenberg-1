"The innermost shell could hold only 2 electrons, the next 8, the next 18 and so on.","In order to do that, wires would have to be sealed into a glass tube from which all (or almost all) the air was withdrawn.",[Illustration: _Dmitri Mendeléev and Bohuslav Brauner in Prague in 1900.,"The same was true of thorium (atomic number 90), which began a series that also ended with lead.","The isotopes could be referred to as lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208.","A solid might turn into a gas; a single substance might change into two or three different substances, but whatever happened, the total mass at the end was exactly the same (as nearly as chemists could tell) as at the beginning.",Suppose the sun’s mass were a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen and it were burning at a rate sufficient to produce the energy at the rate it was giving it off.,"If, after being pulled apart, the atoms are allowed to come together again, they give off energy.","Scientists began to speculate that electricity, like matter, might consist of tiny units.",Soddy had worked out the way in which atomic weights altered every time an alpha particle or a beta particle was given off by an atom.,Thomson’s instrument was the first one capable of separating isotopes and such instruments came to be called “mass spectrometers”.,"In 1900, indeed, Becquerel studied the beta particles and found them to be identical in mass and charge with electrons.","There were positive ions made up of atoms or groups of atoms, from which one or more of the electrons within the atoms had been removed.",Uranium was the first element found to be radioactive.,"When electricity broke up a molecule, perhaps a unit of electricity attached itself to each atom.","At least elements with atomic numbers of 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, 87, and 91 were still not known.","This seemed to show that the cathode rays possessed mass and were a stream of atom-like particles, rather than a beam of mass-less light.","In 1911 he noted that when X rays passed through atoms, some were absorbed and some bounced back.","What’s more, alpha particles were being emitted at velocities of perhaps 30,000 kilometers per second, while the lighter beta particles were being shot off at velocities of up to 250,000 kilometers per second (about 0.8 times the velocity of light).","If only the innermost shell contained electrons and it were filled with the 2 electrons that were all it could hold, then that was a stable arrangement.",It also produced important changes in matter.,But what if an atom did not have its electron shell so neatly filled.,"There was such a close connection, in fact, that Moseley could arrange the elements in order according to the wavelength of the characteristic X rays.",He suggested that the sun was contracting.,"Working backward, however, it seemed that 25 million years ago, the sun must have been so large as to fill the earth’s orbit.","When the X rays struck atoms of high atomic weight, the X rays that bounced back were particularly penetrating.",By 1906 Rutherford had worked out the nature of the alpha particles.,If it attached a negative unit of electricity to itself it would be pulled in the other direction.,"If _all_ the energy delivered by a gram of uranium in the course of its radioactivity over many billions of years was totalled, it was enormously greater than the energy produced by the burning of a candle with a mass equal to that of uranium.",Was that fractional atomic weight something that was possessed by all neon atoms without exception or was it the average of some lightweight atoms and some heavyweight ones?,"In the first years of the 19th century, it was found that a current of electricity could cause different atoms or different groups of atoms to move in opposite directions through a liquid in which they were dissolved.",One of those involved in the search was the French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852-1908).,"[Illustration: _Antoine Henri Becquerel._] At once, physicists became fascinated with X rays and began searching for them everywhere.",But what was the mysterious radiation emitted by uranium and thorium?,This increases the chance that some molecules will be broken up into separate atoms (though the actual process is rather complicated).,"Until then, uranium had not been of much interest to chemists.",All the rest of the atom was filled with the very light electrons.,The answer wasn’t easy to get.,He used the rise in temperature as a measure of the energy.,"Heat is a form of energy, since it will expand steam that will force wheels into motion that can then do work.","For instance, hydrogen gas, as it is found on earth, is made up of molecules containing 2 hydrogen atoms each (H₂).",There are various forms of energy.,"Electricity did more than radiate through matter, however.","This work of Rutherford and Soddy began a line of investigation that by 1907 had shown that there was a whole radioactive chain of elements, each one breaking down to the next in line by giving off either an alpha particle or a beta particle, until finally a lead atom was formed that was not radioactive.","The 2 ions, with opposite charges, would cling together, since opposite charges attract, and thus the molecule of sodium fluoride (NaF) would be formed.","Others, in addition to Becquerel, were soon investigating the new phenomenon.","That is, a moving hammer will drive a nail into wood, while the same hammer held motionlessly against the nailhead will not do so.","If the atomic weight of some element happens to be very close to a whole number to begin with, it may consist of a single kind of atom.",Anything capable of performing work is said to possess “energy” from Greek words meaning “work within”.,The amount of energy in burning wood could be measured if it were mixed with air and allowed to burn in a closed container that was immersed in a known quantity of water.,The energy in a match flame is enough to raise the temperature of the mixture and to make the hydrogen and oxygen molecules move about more rapidly and more energetically.,"It did not seem impossible that such a rule might exist, since one had been found in connection with matter that appeared in even greater variety than energy did.",Helmholtz calculated that the sun’s contraction over the 6000 years of recorded history would have reduced its diameter only 560 miles—a change that would not have been noticeable to the unaided eye.,The uranium series ought to end with lead atoms that had an atomic weight of 206.,In 1912 Thomson was working on neon.,"Then, 98.9% of all carbon atoms (atomic symbol C) are ¹²C, but 1.1% are ¹³C.","The neon atom has 10 electrons—2 in the innermost shell, and 8 in the next—and it does not react.",By 1847 he was convinced that any form of energy could be turned into fixed and predictable amounts of heat; that a certain amount of work was equivalent to a certain amount of heat.,In 1916 the American chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis (1875-1946) carried this notion farther.,"In the combined presence of a magnet and of an electric field, the neon ions move in a curved path.","It is not surprising that the atomic weights of nitrogen and carbon are just about 14 and 12, respectively.",The energy released by the uranium over a very long time grew to be enormous.,The atomic number increases as one goes up the line of atoms.,[Illustration: _W.,It quickly turned out that the atomic number was more fundamental and more characteristic of a particular element than was the atomic weight.,"In 1891, though, the Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney (1826-1911) suggested that the supposed unit of electricity be given a name at least.","By 1885, however, the English physicist William Crookes (1832-1919) showed that cathode rays could be made to turn a small wheel when they struck that wheel on one side.","There were the atoms, which made up ordinary matter, and the electrons, which made up electric current.",It is for that reason that a great deal of energy (mostly in the form of heat) is given off if a jet of hydrogen gas and a jet of oxygen gas are allowed to mix in such a way as to form water.,"It starts at one pole of a battery, or of some other electricity generating device, and ends at the other.",[Illustration: _Niels Bohr_] [Illustration: _Bohr’s study._] Since Dalton’s time it had been assumed that all the atoms of a particular element were of equal atomic weight and that atoms of two different elements were always of different atomic weight.,The third was soon called “gamma rays” after the third letter.,"The early investigators quickly found that the breakdown of uranium-238, for instance, could not be hastened by heat, pressure, changes in chemical combination, or, indeed, anything else they could think of.","If something like the Thomson view were correct then the number of electrons, each with one unit of negative electricity, would depend on the total size of the positive charge carried by the atom.","The rate of radioactive changes, however, could not apparently be altered.","The uranium atom would give off 2,000,000 times as much energy in breaking down, as the carbon atom would in combining.",None could either be destroyed or created.,"Uranium X₁, had, however, radioactive properties different from ordinary thorium.",The sun gave the appearance of being a huge globe of fire.,"Here, then, is the meeting point of electrons and of atoms—the particles of electricity and of matter.","By 1945, all seven had been discovered.",The molecules of hydrogen and oxygen must be separated and that takes a little energy.,"In fact, each different type of atom seemed associated with reflected X rays of a particular penetrating power, so Barkla called these “characteristic X rays”."
