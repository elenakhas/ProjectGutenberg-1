ENERGY The Law of Conservation of Energy We have now gone as far as we conveniently can in considering the intertwining strands of the atom and of electricity.,They carried a positive electric charge that was twice as great as the electron’s negative charge.,"What’s more, alpha particles were being emitted at velocities of perhaps 30,000 kilometers per second, while the lighter beta particles were being shot off at velocities of up to 250,000 kilometers per second (about 0.8 times the velocity of light).","The rate of radioactive changes, however, could not apparently be altered.",And then in 1896 came the discovery of radioactivity.,"In the case of some elements, each atom could attach 2 units of electricity to itself, or perhaps even 3.","If only the innermost shell contained electrons and it were filled with the 2 electrons that were all it could hold, then that was a stable arrangement.","The atomic weight of uranium (chemical symbol U) is just about 238 and, indeed, most of its atoms are ²³⁸U.",Atomic weights determined by this system were “physical atomic weights”.,All the rest of the atom was filled with the very light electrons.,The various atoms formed in these three radioactive series were not all different in every way.,"Eventually, Stoney’s name for the units of electricity was applied to the particles that carried those units.","This was not easy to do and it was not until 1854 that Heinrich Geissler (1814-1879), a German glass-blower and inventor, accomplished this feat.","[Illustration: _Michael Faraday_] The units of electricity were a great deal more difficult to study than the atomic units of matter, and throughout the 19th century they remained elusive.",The energy of their collisions might then be converted into heat and light and this could keep the sun shining for as long as the supply of meteors held out—even millions of years.,"In order to do that, wires would have to be sealed into a glass tube from which all (or almost all) the air was withdrawn.","If some were more massive than others, the more massive ones would curve less.","It would be a matter of crucial importance if isotopes of neon could be found, for neon had nothing to do with any of the radioactive series.","Thomson showed, from the amount of curving, that there was a neon isotope with an atomic weight of 20 and one with an atomic weight of 22—²⁰Ne and ²²Ne.",Always the amount of energy absorbed in one change is given off in the opposite change.,"Its outermost layers were falling inward, and the energy of this fall was converted into heat and light.",It appeared that if an atom attached a positive unit of electricity to itself it would be pulled in one direction through the solution by the voltage.,"[Illustration: _Frederick Soddy_] There was, in short, a “radioactive series” beginning with uranium (atomic number 92) and ending with lead (atomic number 82).",Was there some source of energy greater than chemical energy?,"In the combined presence of a magnet and of an electric field, the neon ions move in a curved path.",Further investigations yielded results not compatible with the raisins-in-the-pound-cake notion.,"Working backward, however, it seemed that 25 million years ago, the sun must have been so large as to fill the earth’s orbit.",Its atomic weight was 207.2.,"Uranium X₁, had, however, radioactive properties different from ordinary thorium.",The English scientist Michael Faraday (1791-1867) noted in 1832 that a given quantity of electricity seemed to liberate the same number of atoms of a variety of different elements.,"There were negative ions made up of single atoms or of groups of atoms, to which one or more extra electrons had been added.",The heat could help boil water and run a steam engine.,It quickly turned out that the atomic number was more fundamental and more characteristic of a particular element than was the atomic weight.,"In that same year, the German physicist Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz (1821-1894) advanced the general notion that a fixed amount of energy in one form was equal to the same amount of energy in any other form.","[Illustration: showing Helium atom, Hydrogen atom; Nucleus, Proton,                       Neutron, Electron labelled] Isotopes In 1902 Rutherford and his co-worker Frederick Soddy (1877-1956) showed that when uranium atoms gave off alpha particles, a new kind of atom was formed that was not uranium at all.","(This effect, when current flows in a wire, is what makes a motor work.)",For that reason ²H and ¹H differ in ordinary chemical properties more than isotopes usually do and Urey therefore gave ²H the special name of “deuterium” from a Greek word meaning “second”.,"The reason mankind had remained unaware of radioactivity and very aware of chemical reactions was, first, that the most common radioactive processes are so slow that their great energies were stretched over such enormous blocks of time as to be insignificant on a per second basis.","What’s more, the radiation would fog the plate, even if the plate were wrapped in black paper, so that it could penetrate matter just as X rays could.",They _were_ electrons.,The energy in a match flame is enough to raise the temperature of the mixture and to make the hydrogen and oxygen molecules move about more rapidly and more energetically.,"Furthermore, the alpha particle was much more massive than the electron.",It couldn’t be very large for if it were the alpha particles would hit it frequently.,The radioactive elements did not escape this new view either.,"Its nucleus carries a unit positive charge, +1, and the hydrogen atom possesses 1 electron to balance this.",For that matter a single smoldering cigarette end can serve to burn down an entire forest in a vastly destructive chain reaction.,By 1906 Rutherford had worked out the nature of the alpha particles.,But what if an atom did not have its electron shell so neatly filled.,"For some 40 years prior to this, the elements had been listed in order of atomic weight.",The uranium series ought to end with lead atoms that had an atomic weight of 206.,"The same was true of thorium (atomic number 90), which began a series that also ended with lead.","Still a third element, actinium (atomic number 89) was, at that time, the first known member of a series that also ended in lead.",None could either be destroyed or created.,It is time to turn to the third strand—energy.,The instrument was therefore called a “calorimeter”.,In 1904 the German chemist Richard Abegg (1869-1910) first suggested that atoms were held together through the transfer of electrons from one atom to another.,"Naturally, if you let 2 oxygen atoms come together to form an oxygen molecule, you get back 12% more energy than if you allow 2 hydrogen atoms to come together to form a hydrogen molecule.","ELECTRICITY Units of Electricity Through the 18th century, scientists had been fascinated by the properties of electricity.","This sharing could only take place if the atoms remained close neighbors, and it would take energy to pull them apart and break up the shared pool, just as it would take energy to pull 2 ions apart against the attraction of opposite charges.",Sometimes it even bounced directly backward.,"If, in such a case, an electron were removed, the atomic charge of +5 would be balanced by only 4 electrons with a total charge of -4.","On his right are early X-ray pictures._] This view of the cathode rays as consisting of a stream of electrically charged particles was confirmed by another English physicist, Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940).","This name, containing “X” for “unknown”, was retained even after physicists worked out the nature of X rays and found them to be light-like radiation made up of waves much shorter than those of ordinary light.","Or could stable lead be made up of a mixture of isotopes, each of a different whole-number atomic weight and was the overall atomic weight a fraction only because it was an average?",Such electrically charged atoms were called “ions” and their existence had been suspected since Faraday’s day.,The molecules of hydrogen and oxygen must be separated and that takes a little energy.,"[Illustration: _Hans Geiger (left) and Ernest Rutherford at Manchester University about 1910._] According to Rutherford’s notion, the atom consisted of a single tiny positively charged lead shot at the center of a foam of electrons.","Where, then, did that energy come from?","Secondly, chemical reactions are easily controlled by changing quantities, concentrations, temperatures, pressures, states of mixtures, and so on, and this makes them easy to take note of and to study.","It was understood at the time that electricity existed in two varieties, which were called positive and negative.","The sodium atom has 11 electrons—2, 8, and 1—while the fluorine atom has 9 electrons—2 and 7.","Beginning in 1840, however, the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818-1889) began a series of experiments in which he made use of every form of energy he could think of.",He and those who followed him located many isotopes and determined the frequency of their occurrence with considerable precision.,"Helium, for instance (atomic symbol He) has an atomic weight of just about 4 and, indeed, almost all the atoms making it up are ⁴He.","Though all give off beta particles, radium B has a half-life of 27 minutes, radium D one of 19 years, thorium B one of 11 hours, and actinium B one of 36 minutes.",In 1884 the Swedish chemist Svante August Arrhenius (1859-1927) had first worked out a detailed theory based on the suggestion that these ions were atoms or groups of atoms that carried an electric charge.,"The New Zealand-born physicist Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) called the first two kinds of radiation “alpha rays” and “beta rays”, after the first two letters of the Greek alphabet.","Since the development of the telescope, two and a half centuries earlier, the decrease in diameter would have been only 23 miles and that was not measurable by the best techniques of Helmholtz’s day.","Thus, when Moseley first presented scientists with the atomic number it turned out that there were still 7 elements that were not discovered.","Then, the investigations into radioactivity had shown that atoms of uranium and thorium spontaneously broke up into smaller particles, including electrons and alpha particles.","A solid might turn into a gas; a single substance might change into two or three different substances, but whatever happened, the total mass at the end was exactly the same (as nearly as chemists could tell) as at the beginning.",An oxygen atom might then strike a hydrogen molecule to form water (O + H₂ → H₂O) and more energy is given off than was absorbed from the match flame.,"Almost at once it was learned that whatever the radiation was, it was not uniform in properties."
