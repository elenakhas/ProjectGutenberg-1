"It seems to me we can work together.""","Lord love ye, she's an old friend o' mine.","Remember?""",asked Grandfather Nat.,"Mrs. Grimes screwed her red nose at the woman before her, jerked up her crushed bonnet, and plucked her rusty skirt across her knees with the proper virtuous twitch.",I still failed to understand the method of its arrival.,"""Where is he?""","Viney swore, and dropped his other hand.","""You're a stranger lately.","Ah, I know, I do!""",It amounted to this.,"It's what I might call the universal topic in neighbourin' circles, an' a gen'ral subjick o' local discussion.","The sun sank below London, and night came slow and black over the marshes and the Cop.","The talk in the bar went on, being almost entirely the talk of Mr. Cripps; who valued himself on the unwonted importance his news gave him, and aimed at increasing it by saying the same thing a great many times; by saying it, too, when he could, in terms and phrases that had a strong flavour of the Sunday paper.","Mrs. Grimes's head drooped faintly, and her eyelids nearly closed.","He tugged at her wrist to extort an answer, and the woman's face was drawn with fear.","Maybe the mail's late.""",It was no matter of scruple or compunction; of that he never dreamed.,"Then he replaced them on his knees and rested his fists on his thighs, just above where they lay.","Mrs. Grimes's declaration drew a growling answer in a man's voice, wholly indistinct; and I found a patch in the canvas, with a loose corner, which afforded a peep-hole.","Another pair o' doors just over there, an' the bar brought round like so, an' that for Bottle an' Jug, and throw the rest into Public Bar.","I was on'y doin' the friendly, that's all; bein' a old pal.","Screaming still, with a growing hoarseness, and writhing where he lay, the blinded wretch scratched helplessly at the reeking lime that scorched his skin and seared his eyes almost to the brain.","Up and over the bank, and down on the side next the river, he went so boldly that one at a distance would never have guessed him blind; for on any plain road he had once traversed he was never at fault; and he turned with such readiness at the proper spot, and so easily picked his way to the shed, that Dan had scarce more warning than could bring him as far as the door, where they met.","I'll give 'im honest an' grateful!""",Tell 'im to-night.,he sung out.,"""Will ye tell 'im, then?","Ever see him before?""","Grimes came running in shirt and trousers, and, as soon as he could find how matters stood, turned and ran again for oil.","he cried, ""there's a toff somewhere near, I can tell by the sound of his money!","But it's halves for me, mind ye.","he said, in a low voice, drawing me to his side.","Out with it!""","Presently I got up again, and looked out over the river.",'E can't come to you 'cos o' showin' 'isself.,"""No--not to say dear, seein' 'ow prices is up.",For a moment Musky Mag disbelieved eyes and ears together.,"How long would a man last, that had both his eyes to see with, eh?""","But see now, Stevy, see; as to goin' away, now.","I'm afraid it may be gone now; but if I'd 'a 'ad the money----"" A noise of trampling and singing without neared the door, and with a bang and a stagger a party of fresh customers burst in and swept Mr. Cripps out of his exposition.","The blow on the head might have been caused by an accident on the riverside, or it might have been inflicted wilfully by an assailant.","Reassured, as it seemed, by what he saw of the company present, he came boldly in, and called for a drink with an elaborate air of unconcern.","""Looks as though the money wasn't his, don't it?""","""Love ye, cap'en, why, I didn't mean that!","Well, I know that; an' not play no tricks.","Mrs. Grimes's face was blank with wonder and doubt, but in her eyes there was a growing and hardening suspicion.","Which reminds me, speakin' of 'andsome things.","You'll 'ave sich a sign as'll attract the 'ole artistic feelin' of Wapping an' surroundin' districks of the metropolis, I assure you.","""Yes,"" replied Viney, now a little more himself.",CHAPTER VIII STEPHEN'S TALE I found it quite true that one might eat the loose sugar wherever he judged it clean enough--as most of it was.,"""_When_ I get it,"" my grandfather replied with a chuckle, ""anything might happen without surprisin' me.","I thought I should catch cold, and perhaps tumble overboard, if I had a bad dream; and I said so.",'Ope I didn't 'urt ye!,"He went grinning and cursing up the passage and so toward the bridge, without another word or look.","Nobody was there, and nobody was in the bar.",For a moment Mr. Cripps's countenance fell; truly it would have been more imposing to have jumped over the bar.,"Indeed that disaster was very freely spoken of, all along the waterside, as a deliberate scuttling, and it was felt that Captain Nat could lay his bereavement to something worse than the fair chance of the seas.","And there were two others, regular frequenters both.","I got to frighten 'em, my boy--an' I do it, too.""","Clearer against a faint patch, which had been white with lime in daylight, the figure grew to that of a man; a man moving in that murky darkness with an amazing facility, address, and quietness.",he queried.,I nodded gravely.,"So he said very little, except that Viney might come and make any proposal he pleased; hoping for some chance-come expedient whereby he might screw out a little on account.","""Ahoy!""","he repeated; ""Cap'en Nat Kemp's got 'em.""","And if you'd like something on account to buy the board for the sign--or say two boards if you like--we'll see about it after dinner.""","And pawn-shops, slop-shops, tobacco-shops--every shop almost--had somewhere in its window a selection of those curiosities that sailors make abroad and bring home: little ship-models mysteriously erected inside bottles, shells, albatross heads, saw-fish snouts, and bottles full of sand of different colours, ingeniously packed so as to present a figure or a picture when viewed from without.","As for that artist, he attained his dinner, and a few shillings under the name of advance; and so was well pleased with his morning's work.","Where was it?""","While Dan Ogle remained undisturbed, and justice was balked for a while; for it turned out in the end that when the police suspected Dan Ogle they were right, and when they went to other conjectures they were wrong.","True, I had seen very little of my father, but when he was at home he was always as kind to me as Grandfather Nat himself, and led me about with him everywhere; and last voyage he had brought me a little boomerang, and only laughed when I hove it through a window that cost him three shillings.","Grandfather Nat had business in the Minories in the matter of a distiller's account; and for this reason divers injunctions, stipulations, and warnings were entered into and laid upon Mr. Cripps before his departure.","""Don't see it?","Then he looked up, his face stern and hard beyond the common: and his was a stern face at best.","""No,--haven't seen him for months.","""When he was a boy.",So you have--with a knife up your sleeve.,"""Yes.""",he said.,Don't waste time--they're turning him over themselves.,"Then he asked suddenly, ""Where's this blind chap?","But presently I tired of it, and climbed the steps to read the bills describing the people who had been found drowned."
