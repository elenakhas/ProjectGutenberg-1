consequently they were instructed in things which would be most necessary and useful to young women in their rank of life.","The lion was not too proud to be served by the poor little mouse,"" said Victoire.","Her vanity was innocent and transient, her benevolence permanent and useful.","Her affection for Victoire was increased by compassion: during two months the poor child's arm hung in a sling, so that she could not venture to play with her companions.","The mother, who was sitting up waiting most anxiously for the return of her children, clasped her hands in an ecstasy when she saw them return with Madame de Fleury.",No young person had ever boarded six months at her convent without becoming attached to good Sister Frances.,"I could not conceive that the clothes were the cause of their sickness;

and he stopped short and settled his wig.",Then I must tell you that my friend Villeneuf has acquired an immense fortune!,"O'Neill, surprised at the change in her manner, followed her when she left the house, and said, ""It would be a great misfortune to me to have done anything to offend Miss Hill, especially if I could not conceive how or what it was, which is my case at this present speaking.""","By my exertions, or rather by my precautions, they suffered but little damage, and all my neighbours looked upon me as their deliverer and friend; they loaded me with presents, and offered more, indeed, than I would accept.","Satisfied by this promise, the good Sister Frances smiled upon Victoire, who stood beside her bed, and with that smile upon her countenance expired.--It was some time before the little children seemed to comprehend, or to believe, that Sister Frances was dead: they had never before seen any one die; they had no idea what it was to die, and their first feeling was astonishment; they did not seem to understand why Victoire wept.","He was a man who, to an exact knowledge of the duties of his office, joined the power of discovering truth from the midst of contradictory evidence, and the happy art of soothing or laughing the angry passions into good-humour.","She thought of the good Sister Frances, who had been exposed by her means to the unrelenting persecution of the malignant and powerful Tracassier.",The man was clear and firm.,"The Abbe Tracassier is in love with a dear friend of mine, and I know all the secrets of state from her--and I know what I know.","This unfortunate lady was forbidden all intercourse with her friends, and it was in vain she attempted to obtain from her gaolers intelligence of what was passing in Paris.","What farther adventures befell Murad the Imprudent are not recorded;

I could clothe them cheaply.'","She commissioned my brother to bespeak for her, at Venice, the most splendid looking-glass that money could purchase.",Let her rest herself--let her rest; she is quite overcome.,"""Then I advise you, keep your own counsel, as I will.""","I stayed, as usual, this night upon deck, and solaced myself by smoking my pipe.","But let her rest, let her rest--we'll not say a word more, only God bless her;

and he now beheld, by the light of some embers, the person of his gipsy majesty, to whose sublime appearance this dim light was so favourable that it struck a secret awe into our wise man's soul; and, forgetting Hereford Cathedral, and oak bark, and Limerick gloves, he stood for some seconds speechless.","Marshal looked at one another during this speech; and the dread of ridicule again seized on Mr. Hill, when he apprehended that, after all he had said, the mountain might at last bring forth--a rat.","This I carefully did till the day we arrived at Alexandria; when, unluckily, I neglected to count the bales, taking it for granted that they were all right, as I had found them so the preceding day.",I saw them mount their camels!,"Upon the same principles which decided Madame de Fleury against encouraging Victoire to be a poetess, she refrained from giving any of her little pupils accomplishments unsuited to their situation.","here comes my little Mary"" (one of her children, who came running in); ""this is the little girl, sir, to whom the lady has been so good.","Yesterday Maurice mended for    Annette's mistress the lock of an English writing-desk, and he mended    it so astonishingly well, that an English gentleman, who saw it, could    not believe the work was done by a Frenchman;
