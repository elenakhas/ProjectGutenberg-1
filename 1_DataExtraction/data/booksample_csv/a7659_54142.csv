I must give at least one taste of the dramatic manner for which both of these men were sponsors.,"Once upon a time this great king at “Will’s” was waylaid and sorrily cudgelled; which is an experience that--however it may come about--is not elevating in its effects, nor does it increase our sense of a man’s dignity; for it is an almost universal fact that the men most worthy of respect, in almost any society, are the men who never do get quietly cudgelled.",He has never joyed himself     since--no more has any of us.” Yet there were plenty of folks who sneered at these papers even then--as small--not worthy of notice.,"A bookish color is pervading; if he does not steal flowers from books, he does what is better--he shows the fruit of them.","Of Ben Jonson he says: “He lived with a woman that governed him, near Westminster Abbey, and neither he nor she took much care for next week, and would be sure not to want wine; of which he usually took too much before he went to bed, if _not oftener and sooner_”--all which shows a pretty accessibility to gossip.","On their terraces and under their trees used to pace and meditate that strange creature Jonathan Swift, who was in his young days a _protégé_ or secretary of Sir William Temple; and there, too, in the same shade, and along the same terraces, used to stroll and meditate in different mood, poor Mistress Hester Johnson, the “Stella” of Swift’s life-long love-dream.","[45] John Selden, b.",Peps”--was born 1633; died 1703.,"Past his house near Red Lion Square the howling mob drag the bodies of Cromwell and Ireton, and hang them in their dead ghastliness.","[17] It is enough that he wrote them; the merry ones when his heart was light, and the tragic ones when grief lay heavily upon him.",This Archbishop Laud is not only keen-sighted but he is bountiful and helpful within the lines of his own policy.,"“He sat with them some time at the window, taking them on his knees, and kissing them, and talking with them of their duty to their mother, and to their elder brother, the Prince of Wales.” He carried his habitual dignity and calmness with him on the very morning, going between files of soldiers through St. James’s Park--pointing out a tree which his brother Henry had planted--and on, across to Whitehall, where had come off many a gay, rollicking masque of Ben Jonson’s, in presence of his father, James I.",I     dined with Lord Treasurer.,"[73] Richard Baxter, b.","The little boy prince, Gloucester, presumptive heir to the throne, died in 1700 (so did John Dryden and Sir William Temple).","He was witty, and wise in a way, and coarse, and had humor; but he was of a bar-room stamp, and although he could make a great gathering of the court people stretch their sides with laughter, it does not appear that he had any high sense of honor, or much dignity of character.","Englishmen were not as boastful of being Englishmen as in the days when the virgin Elizabeth queened it, and shattered the Spanish Armada, and made her will and England’s power respected everywhere.","And herein lies the difference between this man Shakespeare, and most that went before him, or who have succeeded him; he has supplied real characters to count up among the characters we know.",Its leisurely discourse--placid as summer brooks--would beguile us to sleep.,His name is down among those accessory to the murder of the King.,No scholarly editing of his works or life has been done.,"These twain were handsome fellows, by Aubrey’s and all other accounts; Beaumont most noticeably so; and Fletcher--brightly swarthy, red-haired, full-blooded--dying a bachelor and of the plague, down in the time of Charles I., and thrust hastily into the grave at St. Saviours, where Massinger presently followed him.","But poor Mr. Pepys, in another and later entry, says, “I have bought _Hudibras_ again; everybody does talk so much of it;” which is very like Mr. Pepys, and very like a good many other buyers of books.","_An Irish Dragoon._ Among the writers specially identified with this Queen’s reign was Sir Richard Steele;[99] not a grand man, or one of large influence; and yet one so kindly by nature, and so gracious in his speech and writing, that the world is not yet done with pardoning, and loving, and pitying that elegant author of the _Tatler_--though he was an awful spendthrift, and a fashionable tippler, and a creature of always splendid, and always broken, promises.","What the goldsmith-vicar’s sermons were we can only conjecture: what the poems were he writ, we can easily guess from the flowers that enjewel them, or the rarer “noble numbers” which take hold on religious sanctities.","Anne, the infirm one, who neither read nor wrote, and Mary, so overworked, and Deborah, the youngest (latterly being very helpful)--all desert him.","Later still, he underwent another sentence for offences growing out of his unrelenting and imperious Puritanism--this time in company with one Burton (not Robert Burton,[54] of the _Anatomy of Melancholy_), who was a favorite with the people and had flowers strown before him as he walked to the pillory.","A stern doctrinal theology overshadowed all his boyish years, full of threatening, fiery darts, and full of golden streaks of promise.",[31] From the “Nice Valour or the Passionate Madman.” By Seward this comedy is ascribed to Beaumont.,"It was the witty Dean Swift who suggested to the brisk and frolicsome poet, John Gay, that these gentlemen of the high-road would come well into a pastoral or a comedy; and out of that suggestion came, some years later, “The Beggar’s Opera,” with Captain Macheath for a hero, that took the town by storm--ran for sixty and more successive nights, and put its musical, saucy songlets afloat in all the purlieus of London.","Another striking figure about the court of Charles was a small, red-faced man, keen-eyed, sanctimonious, who had risen from the humble ranks (his father having been a clothier in a small town of Berkshire) to the position of Archbishop of Canterbury.",poor Prue!,"Francis Beaumont, son of Sir Francis Beaumont, b.","He was not introduced, as Spenser had been, by Sir Philip Sidney and by Raleigh to the favor of the Queen.","Certain it is that Taine, in writing of these times, has put an almost malignant touch into his story, blinking the fact that the trail which shows most of corrupting phosphorescence came over the Channel with the new King; forgetting that French breeding was at the bottom of the new tastes, and that French gold made the blazonry of the chariots in which the Jezebels rode on their triumphal way through London to--perdition.","There may be versions that will be truer to the Greek; there may be versions that will be far truer to the Hebrew; there may be versions that will mend its science--that will mend its archæology--that will mend its history; but never one, I think, which, as a whole, will greatly mend that orderly and musical and forceful flow of language springing from early English sources, chastened by Elizabethan culture and flowing out--freighted with Christian doctrine--over all lands where Saxon speech is uttered.","There are colonies, too, planted over seas, and growing apace in these days, whither the eyes and thoughts of many of the bravest and clearest thinkers are turning.","London, 1886.","Or, possibly through urgence of the Court Chamberlain, King James’ _Counterblaste to Tobacco_ may be put on sale there, to mend manners; or Joshua Sylvester’s little poem to the same end, entitled _Tobacco battered and the Pipes shattered about their Eares that idly idolize so base and barbarous a Weed, by a Volley of hot shot, thundered from Mount Helicon_.","“To the office, and thence to dinner at the Hoope Tavern, given us     by Mr. Ady and Mr. Wine the King’s fishmonger.","There is apple-eating, nut-cracking, and some vender of pamphlets bawling “Buy a new booke;” such a one perhaps as that _Horne Booke of Gulls_--which I told you of, written by Dekker--would have been a favorite for such venders.","And one must remember, in visiting the locality, that there stood the ancient and renowned royal mansion of Henry II.--that there was born the Black Prince--and, very probably, Chaucer may have wandered thereabout, and studied the “daisies white,” and listened to the whirring of the pheasants--a wood-music one may hear now in all the remoter alleys.",This will weaken your sympathy for him at once--as it should do.,"[28] “The Duke of Milan.” [29] John Fletcher, b.","But a prevaricator--pretending feeling that is not real--offering friendship that means nothing--proffering gentle words, for hire; never, never!” And in that great Court of Justice--which I am old-fashioned enough to believe will one day be held--where juries will not be packed, and where truth will shine by its own light, withstanding all perversion--and where opportunities and accomplishment will be weighed in even scales against possible hindrances of moral or of physical make-up--there will show, I am inclined to think, in the strange individuality of Swift, a glimmer of some finer and higher traits of Character than we are accustomed to assign him.",_Robert Herrick._ I deal with a clergyman again; but there are clergymen--and clergymen.,"But Addison, more or less fortunate than Sir Roger, does win the widow’s hand, and has a sorry time of it with her.",1587 (at Cologne); d. 1679.,"At Bemerton vicarage, almost under the shadow of Salisbury cathedral, he began, shortly thereafter, that saintly and poetic life which his verse illustrates and which every memory of him ennobles.","And so, with these bright young fellows at the front, and the excellent gray-heads I have named at the rear, we ring down the curtain upon our present entertainment with an “_Exeunt omnes!_” CHAPTER VII.","The ponderous periods of Richard Hooker, and the harshly worded wise things of John Selden,[45] found lodgement in souls that were battling with the snows and pine-woods where Andover and Salem and Newburyport were being planted.","These, with a fishing bout (by way of exceptional entertainment), and a Sunday in a village church, with the Litany well intoned, were all in all to him.","The despairing mother found what consolation she could in virtually adopting the young Andrew Marvell, and eventually bestowing upon him her whole fortune.","Earlier, however, in the lifetime of the poet had begun the issue of those thunderbolts of pamphlets which he wrote on church discipline, education, on the liberty of unlicensed printing, and many another topic--cumbrous with great trails of intricate sentences, wondrous word-heaps, sparkling with learning, flaming with anger--with convolutions like a serpent’s, and as biting as serpents.","He calls the Presbyterians,     “Such, as do build their faith upon     The holy text of pike and gun;     Decide all controversies     By infallible artillery;     And prove their doctrines orthodox     By apostolic blows and knocks;     Call fire and sword and desolation     A godly, thorough reformation,     Which always must be going on     And still be doing--never done;     As if Religion were intended     For nothing else but to be mended.","Even then and there rested on him the same kingly composure; the fine oval face, pale but unmoved; the peaked beard carefully trimmed, as you see it in the well-known pictures by Vandyke, at Windsor or at Blenheim.",Waller has come to a casual literary importance in these days under the deft talking and writing of those dilettante critics who would make this author the pivot (as it were) on which British poesy swung away from the “hysterical riot of the Jacobeans” into measured and orderly classic cadence.,"[33] London was not over-large at this day; its population counted about 175,000.","The coupling together of this pair of authors at their work has the air of romance; both were well born; Fletcher, son of a bishop; Beaumont, son of Sir Francis Beaumont, of Grace-Dieu (not far away from Ashby-de-la-Zouch); both were university men, and though differing in age by eight or nine years, yet coming--very likely through the good offices of Ben Jonson--to that sharing of home and work and wardrobe which the old gossip Aubrey[30] has delighted in picturing.","Not one whit; he is austere among the most austere; in this very week he is engaged upon his defence of regicide, with its stinging, biting sentences.",_The London of Dryden._ But let us not forget where we are in our English story; it is London that has been all aflame in that dreadful year of 1666.,"He did study, however, in his young days, at that old town of Stratford, where he was born--his father being fairly placed there among the honest tradespeople who lived around.","For sometime he was in the household of one of Cromwell’s generals,[79] who lived in a stately country-hall a little way out of Bedford; again, he filled some dependency at that stately Ludlow Castle on the borders of Wales--forever associated with the music of Milton’s “Comus.” It was after the Restoration that he budded out in his anti-Puritan lampoon; but though he pandered to the ruling prejudices of the time, he was not successful in his search for place and emoluments; he quarrelled with those who laughed loudest at his buffoonery and died neglected.","_Hudibras_ is, in fact, a great, coarse, rattling, witty lunge at the stiff-neckedness and the cropped heads of the Puritans, which the roistering fellows about the palace naturally enjoyed immensely.","A monumental record in Trinity Church, Stratford, reads thus: “In memory of Thomas Hart, who was the fifth descendant in a direct line from Joan, eldest daughter of John Shakespeare.",Perhaps the Dean was too blinded for fine reading in the garden alleys then; certainly his fierce headaches were shaking him year by year nearer to the grave.,"He visits them betimes and listens to their adulatory prattle; they, too, come up to the deanery when there are friends to entertain; often take possession when the Dean is away.","“Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave,     Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye,     Thy root is ever in its grave,             And thou must die.","There Locke directed the studies of Ashley’s son; and presently--such was my Lord’s confidence in him--was solicited to find a wife for the young gentleman;[94] which he did, to the great acceptance of all parties, by taking him off into Rutlandshire, and introducing him to a pretty daughter of the Earl of Rutland.",But the Bishops’ Bible was never so popular as the Geneva one.,Even the peasants thereabout stayed the plough and listened reverently (another Angelus!),"It was in the first year of his reign, 1603--he having passed a good part of the summer in hunting up and down through the near counties--partly from his old love of such things, partly to be out of reach of the plague which ravaged London that year (carrying off over thirty thousand people); it was, I say, in that first year that, at the instance of some good Anglicans, he issued a proclamation--“_Touching a meeting for the hearing and for the determining things pretended to be amiss in the Church._” Out of this grew a conference at Hampton Court, in January, 1604.","One wonders, as he comes from toiling through the sweat and muck and irreverent satire of _The Tale of a Tub_, what could have possessed the man to write so piously.",It does not appear in the Wyclif of 1380.,"At the time of trouble with the Scots (1639) he raised a troop for the King’s service that bristled with gilded spurs and trappings; but he never did much serious fighting on British soil; and in 1641--owing to what was counted treasonable action in behalf of Strafford, he was compelled to leave England.","And if the whole weight of tradition is not to be distrusted, it was in this little prison over the river, where passers-by might shout a greeting to him--that John Bunyan fell into the dreamy fashioning of that book which has made his name known everywhere, and which has as fixed a place in the great body of English literature as Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” or Spenser’s _Faery Queen_--I mean the _Pilgrim’s Progress_.","In that budget of notelets I spoke of (and which the wife so carefully cherished), are some charming ones to his children: thus he writes to his daughter Elizabeth, whose younger sister, Mary, has just begun to put her initials, M. S., to messages of love to him:     “Tell her I am delighted: tell her how many fine things those two     letters stand for when she writes them: _M.","When the business of revision actually commenced it is hard to determine accurately; but it was not till the year 1611--eight years after the Hampton Conference--that an edition was published by printer Barker (who, or whose company, was very zealous about the matter, it being a fat job for him) and so presently, under name of King James’ version “appointed (by assemblage of Bishops) to be read in churches,” it came to be the great Bible of the English-speaking world--then, and thence-forward.","He had great dignity; he had wealth; a sort of earlier Edward Everett--as polished and cold and well-meaning and fastidious; looking rather more to the elegance of his speech than to the burden of it; always making show of Classicism--nothing if not correct; cautious; keeping well out of harm’s way, and all pugnacious expressions of opinion; courteous to strong Churchmen; courteous to Papists; bowing low to my Lady Castelmaine; very considerate of Cromwellians who had power; moulding his habit and speech so as to show no ugly angles of opinion anywhere, but only such convenient roundness as would roll along life’s level easily to the very end.",Aubrey says he was one of the best bowlers of his time.,"I steal a piquant bit of his satire on metaphysic study from _What you Will_; it reminds of the frolic moods of Browning:             “I wasted lamp oil, bated my flesh,     Shrunk up my veins, and still my spaniel slept;     And still I held converse with Zabarell,     Aquinas, Scotus, and the musty saws     Of antique Donate:--still my spaniel slept.","[54] Robert Burton, b.","But whatever may befall, always the throng is pressing on, and always the thousands are dropping away and disappearing in the gulf that sweeps below."
