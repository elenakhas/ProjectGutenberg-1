These two ladies set up their homestead near to Swift’s vicarage; he goes to see them; they come to see him.,We hear around it the tramp of armies and the blare of trumpets; yet these do not drown the sick voice of poor distraught Ophelia.,"In the course of the talk we may well believe that King James nodded approval of anything that would flatter his kingly vanities, and shook his big unkempt head at what would make call for a loosening of his purse-strings.","Those who knew him described him as “of middling stature, strong set, roundish face, cherry-cheeked, hazel-eyed, brown-haired.”[75] There are dainty poems of his, which should be read, and which are worth remembering.","Some of these Boyle meditations were on the drollest of topics--as, for instance, “Upon the Sight of a Windmill Standing Still,” and again, “Upon the Paring of a rare Summer Apple.” Swift had no great appetite for such “parings;” but Lady Berkeley being insatiate, he slips a meditation of his own, in manuscript, between the leaves of the great folio of the Hon.","The talk in his comedies, by its pliancy, grace, neat turns, swiftness of repartee, compares with the talk in most comedies as goldsmith’s work compares with the heavy forgings of a blacksmith.","The truth is, Mrs. Vanhomrigh[113] has a daughter--young, clever, romantic, not without personal charms, who is captivated by the intellect of Mr.","But O, she dances such a way!","A show is kept up of his school-keeping, but with doubtful success; for in 1647 we learn that “he left his great house in Barbican, and betook himself to a smaller in High Holborn, among those that open back into Lincoln’s Inn Fields;” but there is no poem-making of importance (save one or two wondrous Sonnets) now, or again, until he is virtually an old man.","Sir Rich^d Saltonstall, Knt., Lord Mayor of London, and 2 others, Commissioners of her Majesty (fortieth yr of Queen Elizabeth), and the parties deputed to collect the first of these subsidies granted by Parliament the yr preceding--(bearing date Oct. 1598), for the _rate of S^t Helen’s Parish_, Bishopsgate ward--the name of _Wm.","The coupling together of this pair of authors at their work has the air of romance; both were well born; Fletcher, son of a bishop; Beaumont, son of Sir Francis Beaumont, of Grace-Dieu (not far away from Ashby-de-la-Zouch); both were university men, and though differing in age by eight or nine years, yet coming--very likely through the good offices of Ben Jonson--to that sharing of home and work and wardrobe which the old gossip Aubrey[30] has delighted in picturing.","May,       Hamnet, twin with            Judith, bapt.",His tastes led him more to banquets at Exeter House.,"The character of Sir Roger will live forever--so gracious--so courteous--so dignified--so gentle: his servants love him, and his dogs, and his white gelding.","So home and to     prayers and to bed.” Another day, having been to court, he says:     “The Queene, a very little plain old woman, and nothing more in any     respect than any ordinary woman.","Anne, strangely enough, married--dying shortly after; Mary died years later, a spinster; and Deborah, who became Mrs. Clark, had some notice, thirty years later, when it was discovered that a quiet woman of that name was Milton’s daughter.","Swift began with being a Whig, to which side his slapdash wilfulness, his fellowship with Temple, and his scorn of tradition drew him; but he ended with veering over to the Tory ranks, where his hate of Presbyterianism and his eager thrusts at canting radicals gave him credit and vogue.",So starched was he in his High-Church views that the Pope had offered him the hat of a cardinal.,When there was some purpose to effect--some wrong to lash--some puppet to knock down--some tow-head to set on fire--some public drowsiness to wake--he rushed into print with a vengeance.,"I know that his latest biographer and advocate, Mr. Saintsbury, whose work you will be very apt to encounter in the little series edited by John Morley, sees poems like those I have cited with other eyes, and fashions out of them an agreeable poetic consistency very honorable to Dryden; but I cannot twist myself so as to view the matter in his way.",There is a charming life of him by Izaak Walton.,"No news to tell you: went to dine with     Mrs. Vanhomrigh, a neighbor.","Not long after these things were a-brewing, Sir William Temple died (1699), bequeathing his papers to his secretary.","Edmund Waller, b.","Rimbault’s _Life_, 1856; also Strahan’s _Biographical Dictionary_, 1784.","Wrapt soft and warm your name is sent on high,     As flames do on the waves of incense fly:     Music herself is lost, in vain she brings     Her choicest notes to praise the best of kings;     Her melting strains in you a tomb have found,     And lie like bees in their own sweetness drown’d.” No wonder that he came ultimately to have the place of Poet-laureate, and thereafter an extra £100 a year with it!",[35] He was a man who had supplemented his university training by long residence abroad; who had been of service to King James (before the King had yet left Scotland) by divulging to him and defeating some purposed scheme of poisoning.,"He went to Cambridge for study at a time when he may have encountered there the grim boy-student, Oliver Cromwell, or possibly that other fair-faced Cambridge student, John Milton, who was upon the rolls eight years later.",What is he to do there?,"At Laracor, the little Irish parish which he came by shortly after, he had a glebe and a horse, and became in a way domesticated there, so far as such a man could be domesticated anywhere.","Addison came to the help of Steele in the _Tatler_, and Steele, afterward joined forces with Addison in the _Spectator_.",[43] Herrick is not an example of this; but Herbert is; so is Overbury with his “Wife;” so is Vaughan; so is Browne.,"And herein lies the difference between this man Shakespeare, and most that went before him, or who have succeeded him; he has supplied real characters to count up among the characters we know.","Then the palace doors opened for that “good,” and certainly weak, Queen Anne, whose name is so intimately associated with what is called “the Augustan age” of English letters, and whose personal characteristics have already been subjects of mention.","In the days when the Armada was crushed, when British ships and British navigators brought every year tales of gold, tales of marvellous new shores, when princes of the proudest courts came flocking to pay suit to England’s great Virgin Queen, what poet should not sing at his loudest and his bravest?","I had my battledore in my hand, and fell a beating the     coffin, and calling ‘Papa.’… My mother catched me in her arms, and     almost smothered me in her embraces, and told me, in a flood of     tears, ‘Papa could not hear me, and would play with me no more.’” This is on page 364 of the _Tatler_, and on page 365 he says: “A large train of disasters were coming into my memory, when my servant knocked at my closet door, and interrupted me with a letter, attended with a hamper of wine, of the same sort with that which is to be put to sale on Thursday next, at Garraway’s coffee-house.” And he sends for three of his friends--which was so like him!","London smoke was a torture to him;

Hamnet and Judith (twins), baptized 1585.","[55] The former of these (Cowley) was the son of a London grocer, whose shop was not far from the home of Izaak Walton; he was taught at Westminster School, and at Cambridge, and blazed up precociously at the age of fifteen in shining verses.",Waller has come to a casual literary importance in these days under the deft talking and writing of those dilettante critics who would make this author the pivot (as it were) on which British poesy swung away from the “hysterical riot of the Jacobeans” into measured and orderly classic cadence.,"He was a man of Devonshire birth, of good family;--a little over-boastful of being above any “want for money;” showing traces, indeed, of coarse arrogance, and swaying dramatically into coarse brutalities.","Yet Locke, although a man of the keenest and rarest intellect--which almost etherialized his looks--was possessed of a wonderful deal of what he would have called “hard, round-about sense;” indeed it would be quite possible to fill a whole calendar with bits of his printed talk that would be as pitpat and common-sensical as anything in _Poor Richard’s Almanac_.","Here, too, he wrote that monument of toleration, _The Liberty of Prophesying_, a work which would be counted broad in its teachings even now, and which alienated a great many of his more starched fellows in the Church.","Independents, Presbyterians, Church of England men, and Papists were all by the ears; and it did seem to many among the shrewdest of even the Puritan workers that some balance-wheel (of whatever metal), though weighted with royal traditions and hereditary privileges, might keep the governmental machinery to the steady working of old days.",Captain Sentry showed great     kindnesses to the old house-dog my master was so fond of.,"[30] Aubrey, who died in 1697, and who is often cited, was an antiquary--not always to be relied upon--an Oxford man, friend of Thomas Hobbes, was heir to sundry country estates, which, through defective titles, involved him in suits, that brought him to grief.","This Princess Anne (afterward Queen Anne) was married to a prince of Denmark, only notable for doing nothing excellently well; and was mother of a young lad, called Duke of Gloucester, whom all England looked upon as their future king.",CHAPTER VI.,"Mr. Pepys (whose memoirs you have heard of, and of whom we shall have more to tell) says that he bought the book one day in the Strand because everybody was talking of it--which is the only reason a good many people have for buying books; and, he continues--that having dipped into it, without finding much benefit, he sold it next day in the Strand for half-price.","He was a man, I think, who would have infinitely scorned and revolted at many of the apologies that have been made for him.","Then, again, English vice is more outspoken and less secretive than that of the over-Channel neighbors.","This Pepys stands a good chance to outlive Butler, and to outlive Burnet, and to outlive Clarendon, and to outlive John Evelyn.",1565 (?,"A Mr. Danvers, kinsman of Herbert’s step-father, thought all the world of the poet, and declared his utter willingness that Herbert “should marry any one of his nine daughters [for he had so many], but rather Jane, because Jane was his beloved daughter.” And to such good effect did the father talk to Jane, that she, as old Walton significantly tells us, was in love with the poet before yet she had seen him.","[56] Indeed his aptitude, his ingenuities, his scholarship, kept him in the first rank of men of letters all through his day, and gave him burial between Spenser and Chaucer in Westminster Abbey.","Milton, however, makes lucky escape, with only a short term of prison;

they passing three days and nights upon the edge of that huge tempest of flame and smoke which devoured nearly two-thirds of London; the old poet hearing the din and roar and crackle, and feeling upon his forehead the waves of fierce heat and the showers of cinders--a scene and an experience which might have given, perhaps, other color to his pictures of Pandemonium, if his great poem had not been just now, in these fateful years, completed--completed and bargained for; £20 were to be paid for it conditionally,[68] in four payments of £5 each, at a day when London had been decimated by the plague, and half the city was a waste of ruin and ashes.","Buckingham was there--that second Villiers,[70] of whom I had somewhat to say when the elder Buckingham came up for mention in the days of Charles I.; this younger Villiers running before the elder in all accomplishments and all villainies; courtly; of noble bearing; with daintiest of speeches; a pattern of manly graces; capable of a tender French song, with all his tones in exultant accord with best of court singers, and of a comedy that drew all the play-goers of London to the “Rehearsal;” capable too, of the wickedest of plots and of the foulest of lies.",In a previous chapter I spoke of the fatherly edicts against Bible-reading and Bible-owning in the time of Henry VIII.,"’Twas said that her ambition and high spirit pushed the poor Elector into political complications that ruined him, and that made the once owner of that princely château an outcast, and almost a beggar.","John Davies b. in Wiltshire about 1570, and d. 1626.","In 1640, only one year after Jeremy Taylor was established in his pleasant Rutland rectory, Archbishop Laud went to the Tower, not to come forth till he should go to the scaffold; and in the Civil War, breaking out presently, Jeremy Taylor joined the Royalists, was made chaplain to the King, saw battle and siege and wounds; but in the top of the strife he is known by his silvery voice and his exuberant piety, and by the rare eloquence which colors prayer and sermon with the bloody tinge of war and the pure light of heaven.","_A Pamphleteer._ A writer, however, of that time, of about the same age with Congreve, whom King William did favor, and did take at one period into his confidence,--and one of whose books, at least, you all have liked at some epoch of your life, and thought quite wonderful and charming--I must tell you more about.","His habits were to study of a morning--dine at a tavern; then to Button’s coffee-house, near to Covent Garden, for a meet with his cronies; and afterward--when the spectre of marriage was real to him--to the tavern again, and to heavier draughts than he was wont to take in his young days.",Even the peasants thereabout stayed the plough and listened reverently (another Angelus!),"I give a sample from his “Ballad upon a Wedding,” though it may be over-well known:     “Her cheeks so rare a white was on     No daisy makes comparison         (Who sees them is undone):     For streaks of red were mingled there     Such as are on a Catharine pear,         The side that’s next the sun.","Therefore and thereby it is that he has fused his thought into such shape as takes hold on human sympathies everywhere, and his characters are all live creatures.","), with William of Orange, and so gave to England that royal couple, William and Mary.","It may interest our special parish to know further that the first American (English) Bible was printed at Philadelphia, by a Scotchman named Aitkin, in the year 1782; but the first Bible printed in America was in the German language, issued by Christopher Sauer, at Germantown, in 1743.",He is unsafe; he will kick over the traces; he will take the bit in his mouth; he will be his own man and not our man.,"[17] It is enough that he wrote them; the merry ones when his heart was light, and the tragic ones when grief lay heavily upon him.","There was foreign travel, also, in which he accomplished himself in continental languages and socialities; he had offers of diplomatic preferment, but his doubtful health (always making him what over-well people call a fussy man) forbade acceptance; else we might have had in him another Sir William Temple.","After some brief stay with his mother in Leicestershire, he goes, at her instance, and in recognition of certain remote kinship with the family of Sir William Temple, to seek that diplomat’s patronage.",Editions of the _Pilgrim’s Progress_ are innumerable.,"With skill her eyes dart every glance,       Yet change so soon, you’d ne’er suspect ’em,     For she’d persuade they wound by chance,       Tho’ certain aim and art direct them.” They are very pretty; yet are you not sure that our wheezing, phlegmatic, business-loving, Dutch King William would have sniffed contemptuously at the reading of any such verselets?","If his use of it be only to     understand some books writ in it without a critical knowledge of the     tongue itself, reading alone will attain his end, without charging     his mind with the multiplied rules and intricacies of grammar.”…     “If there may be any reasons against children’s making Latin themes     at school, I have much more to say and of more weight against their     making verses--verses of any sort.","_King Charles and his Friends._ We open this morning upon times when New-England towns were being planted among the pine-woods, and the decorous, courtly, unfortunate Charles I. had newly come to the throne.","I cannot stay to characterize his great poem; nor is there need; immortal in more senses than one; humanity counts for little in it; one pair of human creatures only, and these looked at, as it were, through the big end of the telescope; with gigantic, Godlike figures around one, or colossal demons prone on fiery floods.","I do not suppose you have read much that he wrote except one book; that, I know you have read; and this bustling, bouncing, inconsistent, indefatigable, unsuccessful, earnest scold of a man was named Daniel Defoe;[98] and the book you have read is _Robinson Crusoe_--loved by all boys better than any other book; and loved by all girls, I think, better than any other book--that has no love in it.",Next we hear of him as preacher--not properly sanctioned even by the non-conforming authorities--but opening that intense religious talk of his upon whatever and whomsoever would come to hear.
