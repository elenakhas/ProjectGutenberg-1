"Why had she been so dense before, why had she thought of it so late, when real harm might have already come?","David opened the heavy, charred door of his own refuge and showed Betsey the remains of the room inside with the fragments of a brick staircase that had once wound upward above it.","But his stories have come down to me so clear and vivid, that I almost feel that I have known those very places with their white houses, their tropical green, the confusion and chatter of foreign tongues in the narrow streets, the hushed silence of the wide, walled gardens.","It stood on the edge of the basin in the last of the failing twilight and, in its airy grace of form and glittering of jade and jewels, it seemed scarcely a thing of reality at all.","Elizabeth had opportunity, while Miss Miranda had gone to fetch some blankets, of telling David that Michael, too, had been seeing strange things in the garden of the ruined house.","What was it you saw?” “It was not so much what I saw, for my eyes are dim and old now, it was what I heard.",Michael sighed deeply.,I hope it will often be that way and that we can help each other more.,"There was a breeze as Miss Miranda had promised, a gentle wind that moved the heavy branches of the pines and touched the surface of the water.","I heard the water splash like a fish jumping, but I am thinking it was more like a charm for bad luck being dropped in, as such Creatures love to do.",The whole desolate place before them was very still.,Eighteen days from Gibraltar and all records broken at last!,Even Dick scarcely turned his head as he sat like some brooding spirit above his master.,“How those coyotes yelp!,"I will have to try again.” It was very late, so that David, after some lingering and wishing that he could be of service, took his leave, Betsey walking with him as far as the gate.","The minutes passed, then a half hour, finally the hour itself struck from a spire in the village.","It is high time to set out the onions to-day, but he would be so disturbed at putting them in before the dark of the moon that I have not the heart to insist on it.","Many nights Betsey spent at the cottage when she guessed that Miss Miranda felt lonely and depressed, although her friend’s cheerful spirit would never admit failing courage.",She has borne away the hearts of both of us but she is a good ship and she will bring them back again.” His stout faith in his ship was matched only by Humphrey’s unwavering confidence.,"“It looks almost like one of Aunt Susan’s picture post cards,” she reflected, “only I don’t think Aunt Susan would stop long at any such quiet and out-of-the-way place as this.” There had been a gay-colored shower of bright postals from Aunt Susan lately, ships and hotels and panoramas of tropical scenes where the inhabitants seemed to have nothing to do but sit about on banks of flowers with brilliant green palms as a background.","She could not believe that any one so stricken as had been Mr. Reynolds an hour before, could have really recovered so quickly.","“Such a long day,” she lamented, “and there are hours of it left!” Very slowly she went upstairs at last.","So clear would be his vision—as he grew a little drowsy—that the very flowers and hedges about him would seem crowded with tiny, rustling figures and the warm night air be full of the beat of little wings.","Those are just the things I never can remember.” “History doesn’t seem so hard,” returned David, “except that, if you study it without a teacher, you get so interested in some parts that you forget to pay any attention to the others.","Once, however, when she looked in she did not see him.","“By five days you shortened the voyage,” he said, “and I had not really hoped for more than four.",But still the wind held and still the ship cut the South-Atlantic rollers like an arrow.,"A surprised farmer, not knowing quite what to make of such a breathless and disheveled stranger, led her up the narrow stairs that climbed to the pigeon loft and opened the door upon the rows of perches and nests.","“I am afraid not,” she replied.","“Quick,” he cried, and, seizing her hand, dragged her, almost headlong, across the open space and up another slope of sliding bricks.","That looks bad for the sheep.” It was disturbing also to see how many scattered sheep he was beginning to pass, little bands, solitary ewes with half-grown lambs trotting at their heels, adventurous yearlings straying farther and farther from their comrades.","“There are favorable winds and chances for good luck on the eastern passage, but when your prow is turned toward home again, when you are obliged to go southward to get the trade winds that blow for all ships alike, then you will find that this is an ordinary craft, just like all the rest.” “We will equal our record or better it,” Humphrey replied obstinately, “although, as I own, the westward voyage is a longer and more difficult one.",I make them my compliments.,I had laid my pocketknife on a stone and Dick’s eye caught it at once.” He began to gather up the scattered papers which were drifting more and more wildly across the lawn.,"It was fortunate that she did not speak aloud for there was the old gardener himself, just behind her.","“I am needing help in the garden,” was all he condescended to say as he pocketed the envelope; “could you give me a hand with pulling the lettuce?","He said little of his worries, however, merely toiled away as the day came ever nearer.","“As you will,” he returned, shrugging his shoulders grumpily, “but it will be dark before long and plenty of time for visiting then.","His face, his white shirt and his blue trousers were all coated alike with dust but she noted with satisfaction how broad his shoulders were and how quickly he moved.","But if he should be delirious again—” “I will be here, sir,” David announced briefly, at his side.","As Betsey looked at it the whole mass was tottering and, but for David’s quickness, would have engulfed them both.","“You should hear Michael sing your praises,” she said.","To come home from school, weary with the labors of the day and find no one there save Anna, busy in the kitchen and not wishing to be disturbed, to have no one glad to see her or desirous of knowing just how things had gone—it had seemed a depressing prospect.","Dick swooped across the garden, where Betsey stood laughing at him and at Michael’s irritation, and flew to the top of the stone wall where he sat scolding with all his might.","One more minute and that hidden figure would move across the moon, but she had no thought for that mystery now.","Yet the beady eyes of the African, fixed so steadily upon him, seemed to hint that some present must be forthcoming or serious difficulties would follow.","It is just at the beginning that I always come to grief.” “Perhaps you could help me and I could help you,” David suggested excitedly.",The place belongs to Miss Miranda and it should be looked after.,Would the looming bulk of this misshapen figure grow bigger and bigger until it blocked her road to higher education?,"“It was a flaw in the steel, I suppose,” he said.","I think it ought to be a very great thing when it is done.” “I think,” began Betsey, “that—oh, look, look!” She stood transfixed with dismay, staring at something behind him.",The subject was one that did not tend greatly toward making one peaceful or at rest in that lonely place.,“You are trying to argue me out of it because you don’t want to believe your own eyes.,"While they moved slowly up the lane, Elizabeth gave an account of the crow’s misadventures.","Perhaps only Dobbin knows how much I think about it while I work here in my uncle’s fields.” “Is that your uncle’s house?” questioned Betsey, looking up at the big chimneys above the trees.","Are you hurt?” “The rod caught me a crack across the knuckles when it first gave way, but it does not signify,” he replied cheerily.","But where is it?” “Wherever it has gone,” Betsey said, “it may come back again some day.","She slept soundly, but for a very little time, awakening with a start.","Donald, in evident concern, was coming closer, but David barred the way and warned him off.","Broken pictures still showed half buried under bricks and plaster, while a mirror leaned crookedly against a wall, showing fantastic patterns of shivered glass.","Since you believe that no man speaks the truth, you shall see with your own eyes that the Chinaman and his treasure are not here.” There was no doubt that the man who had the duty of escorting the foreigner over the ship took extreme delight in conducting him through the narrowest, dirtiest recesses of the hold, so that the court official’s fat person was breathless and his silken garments much the worse for grease and tar when he finally expressed himself as satisfied and came once more on deck.","The green-shaded light, with its brilliant, narrow circle of illumination, showed nothing else clearly, but gave only faint vision of wheels and pulleys, of shining glints that sparkled back from polished steel or ruddy copper, while through the whole room droned the slow song of turning wheels.","The one thought that kept going through her head, oddly enough, was, “I am so glad I did not go with Aunt Susan!” The paper was handed to her, Plane and Solid Geometry, the most difficult subject first as it should be.","David went across the hill to get the things that she had telephoned to Anna to pack, while Betsey mounted the stairs with Miss Miranda to prepare a sleeping place.",For some reason they trod more quietly and spoke more softly when they came within the circle of the open lawn.,"“If it was in the Old Country,” he muttered, “the very Little People themselves would rise up to help a man in such a plight.",The light from the cottage windows fell upon him as he approached the door and showed his figure more clearly although his face was still hidden.,"I just waited in case you needed any help, but you managed better alone than with an old man to hinder.",It was only then that she realized how excited she had been and how wet and weary she was.,"The brighter western sky showed beyond the roofless house, throwing the bent head and broad shoulders into sharp relief.","The sheep was down now, with one of the savage hunters standing over it, another tearing at its throat while the third was slipping along the edge of the flock selecting a fresh victim.","“It’s better I am in body,” the Irishman answered; “indeed I begin to feel almost like a whole man again.",“We stop here so often that now he never goes by.,"“There may be some one at work there,” she thought, “and I can ask the way.” But it seemed far indeed to drag her heavy feet up the hill, through a spur of woodland and along a rough lane between two hedges.",Garven was staring silently out through the window.,"“You have seen something yourself,” she announced.",She is too proud to endure either.,But I know it was only a bolt of lightning and a wooden roof and nobody at hand to save the place.,"“You do make it up to me,” she said.","Betsey stood at the door, watching as long as she could as they went down the hill.",Don’t you want to live here again?” Betsey asked eagerly.,“And may I go and bring the tree to show David?” Elizabeth asked.,"“It is strange how I always loved to watch them,” Miss Miranda said, peering into the quiet water as intently as Betsey; “I used to see all the Signs of the Zodiac, that I believed from their name were so mysterious, but that were pictured here so plainly, month by month, that they became as simple as every day."
