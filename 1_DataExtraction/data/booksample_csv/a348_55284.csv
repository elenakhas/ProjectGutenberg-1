This is really serious.,"""I believe not; but I'm not sure.""",He spoke irritably; clearly he disliked very much what I had read to him.,And he walks like a girl.,And yet there's something drunken in these dreams.,"He was a man of rebellious flesh; when angry, bumps would suddenly rise on his bald head; and his ears would move.","A writer, national in the truest and most complete sense, he embodied in his great soul all the defects of his nation, all the mutilations caused us by the ordeals of our history; his misty preaching of ""non-activity,"" of ""non-resistance to evil""--the doctrine of passivism--this is all the unhealthy ferment of the old Russian blood, envenomed by Mongolian fatalism and almost chemically hostile to the West with its untiring creative labour, with its active and indomitable resistance to the evil of life.",It's unlikely that you ever drank much.,"It is impossible with impunity to waste one's strength, as the young men of my time did.","He used to speak with amazing beauty of the past, and particularly of Turgeniev; of Fet always with a good-natured smile and always something amusing, of Nekrassov coldly and sceptically; but of all writers exactly as if they were his children and he, the father, knew all their faults, and--there you are!",It would be banal to pity a man like him.,"""Hugo?","And I see what a vast amount of life was embodied in the man, how inhumanly clever he was, how terrifying.","There are certain silly French things called _articles de Paris_--well, that's what your stringers of verses produce.","People do desire to live, but he tries to persuade them: ""That's all nonsense, our earthly life.""",I should think you don't understand women; they don't come off with you.,"I myself, when I write, suddenly feel pity for some character, and then I give him some good quality or take a good quality away from someone else, so that in comparison with the others he may not appear too black.""",It isn't true.,"After lunch on the terrace, he took up the book again, and, finding the passage, ""Tolstoi, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche could not live without an answer to their questions, and for them any answer was better than none,"" he laughed and said: ""What a daring coiffeur; he says straight that I deceived myself, and that means that I deceived others too.","Everything is simple, the words few, and a great deal of feeling.",I know it; there are two families like that in Tula.,"Nekrassov's miserable verses, too, are invented from beginning to end.""","NOTE.--When I lived in Kazan, I entered the service of General Kornet's wife as doorkeeper and gardener.","He sighed, screwed up his eyes, thought for a bit, and then added in a low voice: ""We know nothing.""","It could not and cannot be otherwise, for men have become worn out, exhausted, terribly separated, and they are all chained to a loneliness which dries up the soul.","""Ah, you are one of us!","A peasant doesn't ask: 'Why is a third more than a fourth, if four is always more than three,' as one learned young lady asked.","He always roused in me sensations and agitations which were enormous, fantastic; even the unpleasant and hostile feelings which he aroused were of a kind not to oppress, but rather to explode the soul: they made it more sensitive and capacious.","Saying this, he smiled triumphantly: at times he has the broad, calm smile of a man who has overcome something extremely difficult or from whom some sharp, long-gnawing pain has lifted suddenly.","In the evening, while walking, he suddenly said: ""Man survives earthquakes, epidemics, the horrors of disease, and all the agonies of the soul, but for all time his most tormenting tragedy has been, is, and will be--the tragedy of the bedroom.""","He showed just as much of the _barin_ as was needed for these serfs, and when they called out the _barin_ in Tolstoi it appeared naturally and easily and crushed them so that they shrivelled up and whined.","""But how would you reconcile Flerovsky's theory, say, with the part played by the Normans in the history of Europe?""","They had studied life from books written by inventors like themselves, and they thought it a serious business; but it was of no use to a soul.""","he said thoughtfully: ""He is not a Great Russian, and so he must see our life better and more truly than we do.""","And smiling affectionately, he put his hand on Tchekhov's shoulder; and the latter became uncomfortable and began in a low voice to mutter something about his bungalow and the Tartars.","XXI He sat on the stone bench in the shade of the cypresses, looking very lean, small and grey, and yet resembling Sabaoth, who is a little tired and is amusing himself by trying to whistle in tune with a chaffinch.","Then he said: ""How well the peasants compose stories.","and one had to answer: ""No, I don't.""",A telegram came containing the commonest of words--is dead.,"XXXVI ""I do not like people when they are drunk, but I know some who become interesting when they are tipsy, who acquire what is not natural to them in their sober state--wit, beauty of thought, alertness, and richness of language.","""You don't know?","What bird is it?""",He is too rational for that and knows life and people too well.,"Beasts and swindlers--we can leave them out of consideration, though our beast is exceedingly national--what a filthy coward he is for all his cruelty.","Yesterday, before dinner, he came into the drawing-room, just like that, his thoughts far away.",You stand revealed before him and he at once sees all your weak points.,A young witch!,"If he did not want to answer, he would always say ""That's another thing.""","Leo Nicolayevitch looked at him and said with a broad smile: ""You are peevish to-day, like a girl who has reached the age when she should marry but has no lover.""",That is done deliberately; under the silliness of their words is always concealed a desire to allow the other person to show what is in his mind.,"When I answered that Kuvalda had been drawn from life, he said: ""Tell me, where did you see him?""","I had two impressions from this first meeting: I was glad and proud to have seen Tolstoi, but his conversation reminded me a little of an examination, and in a sense I did not see in him the author of _Cossacks, Kholstomier, War and Peace_, but a _barin_ who, making allowances for me, considered it necessary to speak to me in the common language, the language of the street and market-place.","I always thought that these people infected the Yassnaya Polyana house, as well as the great house of Countess Panin, with a spirit of hypocrisy, cowardice, mercenary and self-seeking pettiness and legacy-hunting.","He speaks and forgets, but she remembers.","Let them leave a man in peace, to his habitual, tormenting, and sometimes cosy loneliness in face of the bottomless pit of the problem of ""the essential.""","To-day in the Almond Park he asked Anton Tchekhov: ""You whored a great deal when you were young?""","Suler disagreed with him and, lisping with excitement, read very feelingly some more poems.","This Buslayev characteristic in Tolstoi was perceived through some mysterious intuition by Olaf Gulbranson, the caricaturist of Simplicissimus: look closely at his drawing and you will see how startlingly he has got the likeness of the real Tolstoi, what intellectual daring there is in that face with its veiled and hidden eyes, for which nothing is sacred and which believe ""neither in a sneeze, nor a dream, nor the cawing of a bird.""","""I don't know.""","It would have been a Christian act, and behind it there would have hidden a quick, ironical, little smile, which would be understood as the way in which a wise man retaliates on the fools.","He also said: 'Argue as much as you like, but obey.'",But it's obvious.,"What is called Tolstoi's ""anarchism,"" essentially and fundamentally, expresses our Slav anti-stateism, which, again, is really a national characteristic and desire, ingrained in our flesh from old times, to scatter nomadically.","Sensible people will understand.""","[At times his thoughts and feelings seemed to me capriciously, even deliberately, perverse, but what particularly struck and upset men was just the stern directness of his thought, like Job, the fearless questioner of the cruel God.","How charming it is when man is handsome, how very charming!""","Once Suler, Sergey Lvovitch, Tchekhov, and someone else, were sitting in the park and talking about women; he listened in silence for a long time, and then suddenly said: ""And I will tell the truth about women, when I have one foot in the grave--I shall tell it, jump into my coffin, pull the lid over me, and say, 'Do what you like now.'""","I am scarcely more bookish than he, and at the time I thought him a cruel rationalist despite all his pleasant little phrases.","XXXIII I read him some scenes from my play, _The Lower Depths;_ he listened attentively and then asked: ""Why do you write that?""","In the musing motionlessness of the old man I felt something fateful, magical, something which went down into the darkness beneath him and stretched up, like a searchlight, into the blue emptiness above the earth -as though it were he, his concentrated will, which was drawing the waves to him and repelling them, which was ruling the movements of cloud and shadow, which was stirring the stones to life.","He always greatly exalted immortality on the other side of life, but he preferred it on this side.",His eyes flashed.,"When he accompanied me to the door, he embraced and kissed me and said: ""You are a real mouzhik.","""I don't remember.","I dreamt once that I saw the sky scrofulous, putrescent, greenish-yellow, and the stars in it were round, flat, without rays, without lustre, like scabs on the skin of a diseased person.","O!""","It was pleasant to see this creature of the purest blood, to watch the noble grace of his gestures, the proud reserve of his speech, to hear the exquisite pointedness of his murderous words.","It came out with such amazing simplicity, his pleasure in its beauty was so sincere, that I shall never forget the delight which it gave me at the time, a delight which I could not--did not know how to express, but which I could only suppress by a tremendous effort.",They called us to come to dinner.,"Heroes--that's a lie and invention; there are simply people, people, and nothing else.""","""Hardly,"" said Leo Nicolayevitch doubtfully.","Not only by the labour of peasant men and women, not only by the taxes they pay, but in the literal sense by their blood.",I remember in one of his stories he makes a comparison between a quack village vet.
