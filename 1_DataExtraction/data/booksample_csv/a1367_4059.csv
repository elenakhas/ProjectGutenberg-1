the lady, perhaps, looking for something warmer.","Afterwards he came to think of those poor, home-returning ghosts, which all men have fancied to themselves--the revenants--pathetically, as crying, or beating with vain hands at the doors, as the wind came, their cries distinguishable in it as a wilder inner note.","Included, as Chapters 1, 6, and 8, papers which had already appeared in Magazines in 1892.","In most cases those early Pointed churches are entangled, here or there, by the constructions of the old round-arched style, the heavy, Norman or other, Romanesque chapel or aisle, side by side, though in strong contrast with, the soaring new Gothic of nave or transept.","Perugino's pictures are for the most part religious contemplations, painted and made visible, to accompany the action of divine service--a visible pattern to priests, attendants, worshippers, of what the course of their invisible thoughts should be at those holy functions.","Bartolommeo, Da Vinci, were masters certainly of what we call ""the ideal"" in art.","A master of irony also, in Madame Lucrezia he seems to wish to expose his own method cynically; to explain his art--how he takes you in--as a clever, confident conjuror might do.",The art of Romanino still lights up one of the darkest of those churches with the altar-piece which is perhaps his most expressive and noblest work.,II.,"Or that sanctity of which, in some cases, the world itself instinctively feels the distinction, though it shrinks from the true explanation of it?","[137] At Pontigny itself, for instance, there is a good one; and a very early one at Paray-le-Monial.","Prior Saint-Jean arose, and looked forth--with wonder.","And so, with the bird found, but himself in an agony of home-sickness, thus capriciously sprung up within him, he was driven quickly away, far into the rural distance, so fondly speculated on, of that favourite country-road.",Yet what difficulties again in the religion of Christ!,"To most children the sombre questionings to which impressions like these attach themselves, if they come at all, are actually suggested by religious books, which therefore they often regard with much secret distaste, and dismiss, as far as possible, from their habitual thoughts as a too depressing element in life.",But only see him as he goes.,As he walked or sat he was apt to perceive a yawning depth beside him; would set stick or chair there to reassure himself.,"With no pronounced ornamentation, it is as if in the upper story ponderous root and stem blossomed gracefully, blossomed in cornice and capital and pliant arch-line, as vigorous as they were graceful, and rose on high quickly.","Here again then as he passes through the world, so delightfully to others, they tell him, as if weighing him, his very self, against his merely scholastic capacity and effects, that he would ""do for the army""; which he is now wholly glad to hear, for from first to last, through all his successes there, the army had still been scholar Stokes' choice, and he had no difficulty, as the reader sees, in keeping Uthwart also faithful to first intentions.","Not in vain, it seemed, had Prior Saint-Jean come to this mystic place for the improvement of his body's health.","The lad, however, from one and another, had learned much, when, with his share of the patrimony in hand, enough to keep him, but not to tempt him from scholarly ways, he came to Perugia, hoping still further to improve himself.","Of certain quite visibly elect souls, at all events, the theory of irresistible grace might seem the almost necessary explanation.",6.,"He needs now in fact less repression than encouragement not to be a ""passman,"" as he may if he likes, acquiescing in a lowly measure of culture which certainly will not manufacture Miltons, nor turn serge into silk, broom-blossom into verbenas, but only, perhaps not so faultily, leave Emerald Uthwart and the like of him [227] essentially what they are.","The well-worn, perhaps conventional, beauties of their ""dead"" Greek and Latin books, associated directly now with the living companion beside him, really shine for him at last with their pristine freshness; seem more than to fulfil their claim upon the patience, the attention, of modern youth.","Friend Apollyon seemed able to draw the wild animals too, to share their sport, yet not altogether kindly.","But the beauty of the twin sub-alpine towns further eastward is shaped by the circumstance that mountain and plain meet almost in their streets, very effectively for all purposes of the picturesque.","All around the gulf there is but an expanse of tanglework; beyond it, bleached mountains.","the sense of authority, of a large intellectual authority over us, impressed anew day after day, of some impenetrable glory round ""the masters of those who know,"" is, of course, one of the effects we [218] look for from a classical education:--that, and a full estimate of the preponderating value of the manner of the doing of it in the thing done; which again, for ingenuous youth, is an encouragement of good manners on its part:--""I behave myself orderly.""","Facile master as he may seem, as indeed he is, he is also one of the world's typical scholars, with [39] Plato, and Cicero, and Virgil, and Milton.","In Uthwart, then, is the plain tablet, for the influences of place to inscribe.","or over the roof, and onward into space, circling there independently, minutely, as Sidus Cantiorum?","*Published in the New Review, Nov. 1890, and now reprinted by the kind permission of the proprietors.","From perch to perch of the great axle-tree in the centre, monastic feet might climb, gentle monastic hands pass round to every tiny compartment in turn.","Thither nevertheless he was now to depart, sent to the Grange or Obedience of Notre-Dame De-Pratis by the aged Abbot (about to resign in his favour) for the benefit of his body's health, a little impaired at last by long intellectual effort, yet so invaluable to the community.","It was like a calm at sea, delaying one's passage, one's purpose in being on board at all, a dead calm, yet with an awful feeling of tension, intolerable at last for those who were still all athirst for action.",So it was with Uthwart about his seventeenth year.,"Yet the order of Cluny, in its time, in that dark period of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, had deserved well of those to whom religion, and art, and social order are precious.",How great the disappointment!,A false restoration only frustrates the proper ripening of his work.,"Henceforward Raphael will be able to tell a story in a picture, better, with a truer economy, with surer judgment, more naturally and easily than any one else.","A consequent close acquaintance with antiquity, with the very touch of it, blossomed literally in his brain, and, under his facile hand, in artistic creations, of which the Galatea is indeed the consummation.","Men of the world find them agreeable, and even women intelligible.""","The very structure of the place, and its relation to the main edifice, indicate that it was for use on occasion, when, at certain great feasts, that of the Magdalen especially, to whom the church of Vezelay is dedicated, the monastery was swollen with pilgrims, too poor, too numerous, to be lodged in the town, come hither to worship before the [138] relics of the friend of Jesus, enshrined in a low-vaulted crypt, the floor of which is the natural rocky surface of the hill-top.","See under ""Romanticism,"" 1876.","And again what outline, what absolute clarity of outline!","The veritable plunge from youth into manhood came when one passed finally through those old Gothic gates, from a somewhat dreamy or problematic preparation for it, into the world of peremptory facts.","""You are forming me!""","With his delightful, fresh-blown air, he is for ever tossing the sheath from the sword, but always as if into bright natural sunshine.",SOME GREAT CHURCHES IN FRANCE.,"Raphael's connexion with it seems to have become intimate, and from the first its influence must have overflowed so small a place.",High monastic walls intrenched the monk still further.,"""It is hell-fire!""",How afflicting to the mind's eye!,"It is like a nun's church, or like a nun's coif.","For he could find quotations to his purpose from recondite writers, [73] though he was not a man of erudition; like a man of the world again, he read little, but that absorbingly, was the master of two authors, Epictetus and Montaigne, and, as appeared afterwards, of the Scriptures in the Vulgate.","He and his fascinations, his music, himself, might at least be taken for an embodiment of all those genial influences of earth and sky, and the easy ways of living here, which made him turn, with less of an effort than he had known for many years past, to his daily tasks, and sink so regularly, so immediately, to wholesome rest on returning from them.","Mais quand l'univers l'ecraseroit, l'homme seroit encore plus noble que se qui le tue, parce qu'il sait qu'il meurt, et l'avantage que l'univers a sur lui, l'univers n'en sait rien.","In the natural objects of the first Pointed style there is the freshness as of nature itself, seen and felt for the first time; as if, in contrast, those older cloistral workmen had but fed their imagination in an embarrassed, imprisoned, and really decadent manner, or mere reminiscence of, or prescriptions about, things visible.","VEZELAY* [126] As you discern the long unbroken line of its roof, low-pitched for France, above the cottages and willow-shaded streams of the place, you might think the abbey church of Pontigny, the largest Cistercian church now remaining, only a great farm-building.","The kind of thing people there had already seen so many times, but done better, in a sense not to be measured by degrees, with a wholly original freedom and life and grace, though he perhaps is unaware, done better as a whole, because better in every minute particular, than ever before.",He seemed to feel upon his shoulder just then the touch of his friend beside him.,the contents?,"He no longer records, therefore, the mathematical apercus that may visit him;
