"To whom I made a promise, if the Lord permitted, to be with them on the time aforesaid.","_Bun._  I said the Scripture should: and that by comparing one Scripture with another; for that will open itself, if it be rightly compared.","* * * * * AFTER that I had received this sentence of banishing, or hanging, from them, and after the former admonition, touching the determination of the justices if I did not recant; just when the time drew nigh, in which I should have abjured, or have done worse (as Mr Cobb told me), came the time in which the King was to be crowned.",139.,"Further, if I conclude that banishment is the worst, then if death comes, I am surprised: so that I see, the best way to go through sufferings, is to trust in God through Christ, as touching the world to come; and as touching this world, _to count the grave my house_, _to make my bed in darkness_; _to say to corruption_, _Thou art my father_, _and to the worm_, _Thou art my mother and sister_: that is, to familiarize these things to me.","In the light and encouragement of this word I went a pretty while; and the comfort was the more, when I thought that the Lord Jesus should think on me so long ago, and that He should speak those words on purpose for my sake; for I did think verily, that He did on purpose speak them to encourage me withal.","_Bun._  I said, Show me the place in the epistles, where the Common Prayer-Book is written, or one text of Scripture, that commands me to read it, and I will use it.","36, 37, etc.","Yea, I thought it impossible that ever I should attain to so much goodness of heart, as to thank God that He had made me a man.","I saw, it was as easy to persuade Him to make a new world, a new covenant, or a new Bible, besides that we have already, as to pray for such a thing.","I had two or three times, at or about my deliverance from this temptation, such strange apprehensions of the grace of God, that I could hardly bear up under it: it was so out of measure amazing, when I thought it could reach me, that I do think if that sense of it had abode long upon me, it would have made me incapable for business.","You may do much good if you continue still in the land; but alas, what benefit will it be to your friends, or what good can you do to them, if you should be sent away beyond the seas into _Spain_, or _Constantinople_, or some other remote part of the world?","_But there is forgiveness with Thee_, _that Thou mayest be feared_.",Dan.,"31, _I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not_; but it would not abide upon me; neither could I, indeed, when I considered my state, find ground to conceive in the least, that there should be the root of that grace in me, having sinned as I had done.","Ay, saith he, and to a hundred, I warrant you.",1 Sam.,"I have also thought of that saying, _the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city_, _that bonds and afflictions abide me_.",24.,"Now I sunk and fell in my spirit, and was giving up all for lost; but as I was walking up and down in the house as a man in a most woeful state, that word of God took hold of my heart, _Ye are justified freely by His grace_, _through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus_.","When I have indeed conceited that I might be banished for my profession, then I have thought of that scripture: _They were stoned_, _they were sawn asunder_, _were tempted_, _were slain with the sword_, _they wandered about in sheep-skins_, _and goat-skins_, _being destitute_, _afflicted_, _tormented_, _of whom the world was not worthy_; for all they thought they were too bad to dwell and abide amongst them.",_Another_.,187.,Job xxix.,"This scripture did also seem to me to trample upon all my desires; _It is not of him that willeth_, _nor of him that runneth_; _but of God that showeth mercy_.",52.,"And all the while they run in my mind, methought I had still this as the answer, ’_Tis a question whether He hath or no_: _it may be He hath not_.",163.,"Wherefore, one day, when I was in a meeting of God’s people, full of sadness and terror; for my fears again were strong upon me; and, as I was now thinking, my soul was never the better, but my case most sad and fearful, these words did with great power suddenly break in upon me; _My grace is sufficient for thee_, _My grace is sufficient for thee_, _My grace is sufficient for thee_, three times together: And oh!",99.,"’twas hard for me now, to have the face to pray to this Christ for mercy, against Whom I had thus most vilely sinned: ’twas hard work, I say, to offer to look Him in the face, against Whom I had so vilely sinned; and indeed, I have found it as difficult to come to God by prayer, after backsliding from Him, as to do any other thing.","thought I, that He would come down again!",92.,333.,_Cobb_.,"thought I, if it should differ from it, though but the breadth of an hair, what a happy condition is my soul in!","Only Justice _Chester_ being present, stept up and said, that I was convicted in the court, and that I was a hot-spirited fellow (or words to that purpose), whereat he waived it, and did not meddle therewith.",190.,_fire_!,iii.,That Christ’s flesh and blood were within the saints.,"_Bun._  I said, To go to _Elstow_, or _Bedford_, was a civil thing, and not material, though not commanded, and yet God’s Word allowed me to go about my calling, and therefore if it lay there, then to go thither, etc.","This man made it much his business to deliver the people of God from all those false and unsound tests, that by nature we are prone to.",201.,20.,"Sometimes again when I have been preaching, I have been violently assaulted with thoughts of blasphemy, and strongly tempted to speak the words with my mouth before the congregation.","When I would do good, evil is present with me.","Now Christ was all; all my wisdom, all my righteousness, all my sanctification, and all my redemption.","At another time I remembered, I was again much under this question, _Whether the blood of Christ was sufficient to save my soul_?","1, 2.","I quaked at the apostles; I knew their words were true, and that they must stand for ever.",64.,"I did also desire the prayers of the people of God for me, but I feared that God would give them no heart to do it; yea I trembled in my soul to think, that some or other of them would shortly tell me, that God hath said those words to them, that He once did say to the prophet concerning the children of Israel, _Pray not for this people_, _for I have rejected them_.","This made me marvel: for thus thought I, _This man could not know any thing of the state of Christians now_, _but must needs write and speak the experience of former days_.",Luke ix.,why may I not do good to two?,xxii.,"But how should we know it, said he?","So I continued at a great loss; for I thought, if they only had faith, which could do so wonderful things, then I concluded, that for the present I neither had it, nor yet for the time to come, were ever like to have it.","Wherefore I began with all seriousness to examine my former comfort, and to consider whether one that had sinned as I had done, might with confidence trust upon the faithfulness of God, laid down in those words, by which I had been comforted, and on which I had leaned myself: but now were brought those sayings to my mind.","16, and the Spirit that stirreth up in our hearts desires to come to God, for such things as we stand in need of, Matt.",9.,"Again, after I had thus considered the sins of the _saints_ in particular, and found _mine_ went beyond them, then I began to think with myself, Set the case I should put _all theirs_ together, and _mine alone_ against them, might I not then find some encouragement?","Now as Satan laboured by reproaches and slanders, to make me vile among my countrymen; that, if possible, my preaching might be made of none effect; so there was added hereto, a long and tedious imprisonment, that thereby I might be frightened from my service for Christ, and the world terrified, and made afraid to hear me preach; of which I shall in the next place give you a brief account.","The tempter would also much assault me with this, _How can you tell but that the_ Turks _had as good scriptures to prove their_ Mahomet _the Saviour_, _as we have to prove our Jesus is_?","for, about a fortnight before, I was looking on this very place, and then I thought it could not come near my soul with comfort, therefore I threw down my book in a pet: then I thought it was not large enough for me; no, not large enough; but now it was as if it had arms of grace so wide, that it could not only enclose me, but many more such as I besides.","Once as I was walking to and fro in a good man’s shop, bemoaning of myself in my sad and doleful state, afflicting myself with self-abhorrence for this wicked and ungodly thought; lamenting also this hard hap of mine for that I should commit so great a sin, greatly fearing that I should not be pardoned; praying also in my heart, that if this sin of mine did differ from that against the Holy Ghost, the Lord would show it me.","At which words, he {187b} was in a chafe, as it appeared; for he said that he would break the neck of our meetings.","But, saith Justice _Keelin_ (who was the judge in that court), do you come to church (you know what I mean); to the parish church, to hear Divine service?",339.,"Then I considered that in the 10th chapter of the _Hebrews_, and found that the _wilful sin_ there mentioned, is not every wilful sin, but that which doth throw off Christ, and then His commandments too.","I would have gone on, but he would not give me leave.","Well, when I came to the justice again, there was Mr _Foster_ of Bedford, who, coming out of another room, and seeing me by the light of the candle (for it was dark night when I went thither), he said unto me, Who is there?",227.,"This I saw, this I felt, and under this I groaned; yet this advantage I got thereby, namely, a farther confirmation of the certainty of the way of salvation; and that the scriptures were the word of God.","Which, when the tempter perceived, he strongly suggested to me, _That I ought not to pray to God_, _for prayer was not for any in my case_; _neither could it do me good_, _because I had rejected the Mediator_, _by Whom all prayers came with acceptance to God the Father_; _and without Whom_, _no prayer could come into His presence_: _wherefore now to pray_, _is but to add sin to sin_; _yea_, _now to pray_, _seeing God has cast you off_, _is the next way to anger and offend Him more than you ever did before_.","_Secondly_, Because they are denied a share in the promise of life: _It shall never be forgiven him neither in this world_, _neither in the world to come_.","the un-thought-of imaginations, frights, fears, and terrors, that are affected by a thorough application of guilt yielding to desperation!",Now was I tore and rent in an heavy case for many days together.,Thus was my soul at this time (and as I then did think for ever) set at liberty from being afflicted with my former guilt and amazement.,These things did sink me into very deep despair; for I concluded that such things could not possibly be found amongst them that loved God.,"Wherefore I was much afflicted with these things; and because of the sinfulness of my nature (imagining that these were impulses from God), I should deny to do it, as if I denied God, and then should I be as guilty, because I did not obey a temptation of the devil, as if I had broken the law of God indeed.","_Bun._  Then, said I, it is possible my judgment may be as good as theirs."
