In solitude the Desert soaked down into him.,"Firmly determined to keep caution uppermost, yet he went unresistingly to a secluded corner by the palms where they could talk in privacy.","Possibly his face, caught unawares, betrayed this.","But this woman, had she been Jemima Jones, would have made the name distinguished and select.","He peered through the window into the blurred darkness, listening.","His hand was absolutely steady, and he felt that he was a hero.",Another wilder call was sounding in his ears.,"It opens suddenly, cut deep into the swaying world of level plateaux and undulating hills.",It was religious--yet hardly of this earth at all.,"But for these two to skate together in the semi-darkness without speech, often of necessity brushing shoulders almost, was too absurd to think of.",Trumpet voices called to his heart again across the desert of some dim past.,There _may_ be curious results.,"Unlike his first encounter with the man, she looked straight at him.","""A very clever, or a very imaginative man,"" he said to himself, ""who could squeeze the secrets of life and death from such broken lines as those!""","The short hour of twilight brought, too, a bewitchment into the silence that was a little less than comfortable.",The beggar said no single word the whole time.,"A third was necessary to some plan they had on hand, and--they waited to see if he could fill the place.","And all three laughed, yet a laughter without merriment in it.","But wait,"" he added significantly; ""wait till I find these Tablets of the Gods!","It was not yet midnight, and he could skate for half an hour.","It's upset you already; you looked scared, I thought, the moment you came in.""",The Desert lay before him--an open tomb wherein his soul should read presently of things long vanished.,"""I went off easily?""","Turning a moment, he looked back at shining little Helouan in the blaze of evening light.","This was the first impression that he got--from the most striking, curious face he had ever seen in a woman.","He bowed his head a moment, hardly knowing what he did.","The specks of smaller emotions left it clear at first, and as his eye wandered vaguely over the people assembled in the dining-room, it was arrested with a vivid shock upon two figures at the little table facing him.","Of forbidding, even menacing type, they somewhere mated with genuine grandeur.","V In the hall there was light and bustle; people were already arriving from the other hotels and chalets, their costumes hidden beneath many wraps.","Then, making a sideways movement, his feet kicked against something soft and yielding that lay heaped upon the Desert floor, and Henriot discovered the rugs the Arab boy had carefully set down before he made full speed for the friendly lights of Helouan.","You remember--"" he turned hesitatingly to his wife--""some people, I heard,"" he changed his sentence, ""were made quite ill by her.""","""And _much_ wiser,"" said Laidlaw, with a smile, as he bustled about the platform for porters and gave his chief the latest scientific news.","And he said it was the period called the Night of Power--time when the Desert encroaches and spirits are close.""","Here, for the first time, he drew close to Egypt, the Egypt he had sought so long.",A certain confusion spread slowly through his mind as he heard her.,"He, Henriot, was not the only one in danger.","""I have brought them home,"" said the other, in a voice with a ring like iron; ""and I have--deciphered them.""","Moreover, what Vance watched so intently was himself, and the reactions in himself this remarkable woman produced.","But the appointed spot, whence he was to watch, lay upon the summit of the opposite cliffs.",Broad and powerful too.,"And, without a body, we are helpless to control or manage it--deal with it in any way.","And, every night, the sunsets restored the forbidding, graver mood, with their crimson, golden splendour, their strange green shafts of light, then--sudden twilight that brought the Past upon him with an awful leap.",And curious were the thoughts and sensations that accompanied him.,The concentration of his mind incessantly upon them removed it grain by grain and speck by speck.,"The wind _had_ risen, and clouds obscured the moon.","But, while he hesitated, Fate, who sent the warning, pushed him at the same time into the circle of their lives: at first tentatively--he might still have escaped; but soon urgently--curiosity led him inexorably towards the end.","Through the morning mists upon the Nile an old pyramid bowed hugely at him across London roofs: ""Come,"" he heard its awful whisper beneath the ceiling, ""I have things to show you, and to tell.""","Overdressed, the latest worldly novel under their arms, they strutted the narrow pavements of their tiny world, immensely pleased with themselves.","She wore grey clothes of some kind, though not the customary long gloves or sweater, for indeed her hands were bare, and presently when he skated with her, he wondered with something like astonishment at their dry and icy coldness.",It always was a story.,The wind died down.,Centuries passed between the enormous knee-stroke of their stride.,"For the sands heaped upon my memory are shifting, and it is _you_ who are moving them away.""",But Henriot was no longer listening.,"Here, in all the homely, friendly turmoil of a Charing Cross crowd, a curious feeling of cold passed over his heart, touching his life with icy finger, so that he actually trembled and felt afraid.","""It will change things a bit--at last,"" he sighed, settling back into his chair.","He saw the sheet of glimmering, pale desert near and far; and something stung his skin below the eyes.","He's her favourite nephew, and she's as rich as a pig.",Vance went calmly on.,He saw the eternal countenance of the Desert watching him--immobile and unchanging behind these shifting veils the winds laid so carefully over it.,There is no luggage to follow.,"I wanted to kick the beggar for practising such bally rubbish, and in such a place too.",Please don't apologise.,"he thought, referring to the wire netting.","He crossed the Nile at Bedrashein, and went again to the Tomb-World of Sakkara; but through all the chatter of veiled and helmeted tourists, the _bandar-log_ of our modern Jungle, ran this dark under-stream of awe their monkey methods could not turn aside.","""She spoke?""","""And this is all I have.","_In_ his own soul, however, it took place.","Lady Statham had been invisible for days, and Vance was somehow never within speaking distance.","It has, you see, a ready-made mould into which it can come down.""","""How very queer!""","There was the world of tourist English, civilised, quasi-educated, to which he belonged by birth, at any rate; there was the world of peasants to which he felt himself drawn by sympathy--for he loved and admired their toiling, simple life; and there was this other--which he could only call the world of Nature.",that was the word that first stood out and startled him.,Questions and answer flashed.,The life of any one lion is the life of all--the lion group-soul that manifests itself in the entire genus.,"""You saw them?""","For here, in this unguarded moment, the cloven hoof had plainly shown itself.",And with it his mind went too.,Henriot could not name it to himself.,"""Odd,"" he said at length.","And so obsessing was this majesty of its close presence, that Henriot sometimes wondered how people dared their little social activities within its very sight and hearing; how they played golf and tennis upon reclaimed edges of its face, picnicked so blithely hard upon its frontiers, and danced at night while this stern, unfathomable Thing lay breathing just beyond the trumpery walls that kept it out.",It was sacred.,"There are easier and better ways than that."""
