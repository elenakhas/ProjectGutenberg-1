lifting my head at last, I beheld on the littered decks below huddled figures that lay strangely twisted, that writhed or crawled.","Now as I walked betwixt these shapeless forms that flitted on silent feet and spake no word, my flesh chilled; in despite my reason, for they seemed rather spectres than truly men, yet phantoms of a grim and relentless purposefulness.",'Twas after she'd set the ship afire and sought to murder Don Federigo; we left her in the 'tween-decks and I found her nigh stifled by the smoke.,"""'Twas but an Indian herb, fool, and good 'gainst colic and calenture.",said she at last.,"""Trouble, Señor?","And there was a duchess, Martin, was set upon wedding my riches (and me along of 'em) but I have no leaning to duchesses, though this one was young and comely enough.","And now, crouching in this secure haven, I marvelled at the sudden, unearthly stillness of all things; not a leaf stirred and never a sound to hear, for beast and bird alike had fallen mute.","It was an Indian woman who lay where she had fallen, a dead babe clasped to dead bosom with one arm, the other shorn off at the elbow.","Hereupon Sir Richard, scowling mighty fierce, bid such of them as loved life to be gone, whereat in the utmost haste and as one man, up started they all five and took themselves off with such impetuous celerity that we stood alone and masters of all their gear in less time than it taketh me to write down.","""Nay, this is as you will, Martino.","""Oh, Martin!""","What with sea, wind and fierce sun we grew brown as any Indians, but Sir Richard seemed to mend apace and to my great joy, for as time passed my respect for him deepened and with it a kindlier feeling; for in these long days and nights of our fellowship I grew to know how, by suffering patiently borne, a man might come by a knowledge of himself and his fellows and a kindly sympathy for their sins and sorrows that is (as I do think) the truest of all wisdom.","But ever and anon, through some rent in this smoky curtain, I might catch a glimpse of the English ship, her shot-scarred side and rent sails, or the grim havoc of our own decks.","Sir Richard: Indeed so I am, but my joints have been so oft stretched on the rack that I cannot go far and then but slowly, alas!","She: Oh, Martin, dear, foolish blunderer to dream you could fright me with tales of hardship, or dangers, or solitude when you were by, to think I must break my heart for home and England when you are both to me.",Hark'ee again: 'They shall be as chaff before the wind.,"""Drink battle, murder, shipwreck and hell-fire to Adam Penfeather, with a curse!","said Sir Richard, halting to glance about us.","cried he, clasping my hand.","""Begone!""","""Aye, but 'twas me she loved, for I was younger then and something kinder to the eye.",What other way was there?,"And I am happy to inform the Señorita I have been so fortunate as to take and hang no less than five and twenty of her pirate fellowship since last I had the gratification of meeting her.""","And then a voice spake in sonorous Spanish, very soft and low and sweet, yet a voice that chilled me none the less: ""Whom bring ye?""","Tormented thus of my doubts and most horrid speculations, I went at furious speed, yet ever my fears grew the more passionate until it grew beyond enduring and I sighed and groaned, insomuch that my Indian comrade stood off, eyeing me askance where I had cast myself miserably beside the way.","But, finding he yet breathed, I made haste to lower the sail and, shipping oars, paddled towards that opening in the reef that gave upon the lagoon.",said he at last.,"""This--O, glory of God!",quoth I.,"""And yet do I fear!""",said I.,"You are yourself again.""","""And do ye so?""",cried I.,"""And what o' my Lady Joan?","""Are ye much hurt?""","So saying, she put by their hold and (albeit she stumbled for very weakness) nevertheless contrived to descend the quarter-ladder and wave cheery greeting to the roar of acclaim that welcomed her.",I questioned.,"And nigh upon this fort I beheld the stealthy forms of men, toilworn and ragged, whose battered, rusty armour glinted ever and anon as they crept in two companies advancing to right and left.","For look now (and heed me) here we have soul, mind and will, or what you will, pulling one way, and body hauling t'other, and body hath it, physics versus metaphysics--a pretty and notable case--"" ""Why, he hath a notable hard head, Master Penruddock--"" ""Head, Sir Adam, head--were his head as adamantine, as millstone or hard as one o' your cannon balls that shall not save him, if mind and body agreeably seek and desire death, and mind (pray understand, sir) is the more potent factor, thus (saving and excepting the abnormal vigour of his body) by all the rules of chirurgical science he should ha' died three days agone--when the seizure took him.""","""Pray unceasing, friend, plague the Throne wi' petitions, comrade, and a word or so on behalf of old Resolution ere the battle joins, for there's--"" ""I pray God utterly destroy this accursed ship and all aboard her!""",And yet (thinks I) by so doing I should leave two people on this solitary island cut off from their kind.,"Lift me, Martino--lift me--let me die--upon my feet!""",quoth Resolution.,"quoth she, frowning.","Thus, after no great search, I had discovered all such planking as I needed and forthwith began to convey it down to the boat.","Hereafter was the rustle of his stealthy departure, the soft noise of bolts, and silence.","""Wherefore we thank you, Atlamatzin, good friend, you and them, but if fire and battle are abroad we must on so soon as we may.""","""Let a man move a leg and that man's dead!","said he: to the which I agreed and forthwith set about cutting up the pig, first flaying it as well as I might, since I judged the skin should be very serviceable in divers ways.","""But I was ever a fool.""","Suddenly my heart leapt to a shrill scream and thereafter I heard an awful voice, loud and hoarse and tremulous, and between each gasping cry, dreadful periods of silence: ""Oh, God ... Oh, God of pity, aid me ... make me to endure ... Lord God, strengthen my coward soul ... help me to be worthy ... faithful at last ... faithful to the end...."" As for me, well knowing the wherefore of these outcries, the meaning of these ghastly silences, a frenzy of horror seized me so that I shouted and raved, rolling to and fro in my bonds.","But, God forgive you, Adam, why must you be wasting time over your curst journal and idle talk--"" ""I think, Martin!","""Stand to't, my bullies!""","""Lord love you, Martin,"" said he, snatching me in his iron grip, ""Lord love you, what would you be at?","cried a voice, and turning I beheld my enemy, Sir Richard Brandon, his gaunt and fettered arms upraised, his eyes fierce and steadfast.",I commanded.,And men and dog alike seemed direly thin and emaciate.,"said she softly, staring where it glittered in my shackled hand.","""Aye, did he!""","""Loved you it--so greatly, Joan?""","""'Twas so I thought, Martin,"" said he a little humbly, and laying his hands upon my shoulders, ""but only for myself, dear lad, I fight better than I walk, so will I stay and make this my cumbersome body of some little use, perchance; but as for thee, dear and loved lad, I would have you haste on--"" ""Enough, sir,"" quoth I, catching his hands in mine, ""if you must stay to fight, so do I.""","I have seen them when you slept--and never a one but set there by my hand--and now--now you must cherish me if I fail by the way--must bear me in your arms--grieve for my weakness--Oh, dear lad, I would you were a little harsher--less kind.""","Hereupon in feverish haste I recounted much of what I have already set down concerning this strange, wild creature, to all of which he hearkened mighty attentive, pinching at his chin and a frown on his face.","I demanded, scowling, whereupon he beamed on me friendly-wise and blinked his solitary eye.","Well, strike, lady--here, above my gorget--"" ""Die then!""","And because there is nought so purging as fire, to the fire art thou adjudged except, thy conscience teaching thee horror of thine apostacy, thou wilt abjure thy sin and live.","""Aye, by her own confession, and I do know her for a pirate beside, more desperate and resolute than any, known to every rogue along the Main as Captain Jo.""","For there, dim-seen 'twixt the immensity of sea and sky, was a speck I knew for the topsails of a ship.",she murmured painfully.,"In a moment I was on my feet and, with Sir Richard beside me, came where we might look into the green depths below us.","""Rot me but you are afraid of me--afraid, yes!""","""Aye, a boat,"" I nodded.","""I am pirate, yes--and have used dagger and pistol ere to-day and shall again."""
