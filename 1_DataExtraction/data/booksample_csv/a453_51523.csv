"The general view was that the Germans were not very keen on fighting, and a number of them when captured said that they were forced by their officers to fight.",Serve the swine right.,"Shortly after I was wounded the Germans gained the crest of a hill, and one of the Scots Guards lying there wounded put up his hands for them not to shoot, but one of them came to within two yards of him and shot him through the stomach, and he rolled over again and died about two hours afterwards.""","Some of them put up a white flag, and when about fifty of the Warwickshires went out to take the surrendered men they opened fire with a machine gun and slaughtered the Warwicks.",We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.,"The writer continues with a description of the charge, in which, he says, the men of the Black Watch hung on to the stirrup-leathers of the Greys and went through machine-gun fire on to the German lines, and thence through to the guns of the enemy.",There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.,"Official reports leave it beyond doubt that these German troops had undergone three weeks of the severest strain that has ever been imposed on fighting men, and that their _moral_ was so far impaired that, after the wheel made by von Kluck's army away from Paris, the whole of them had to be drawn back and replaced by other troops.","At Quatre Bras, where they were under the eye of the Duke of Wellington, the 92nd (now the 2nd battalion of the Gordons) lost heavily, and then at Waterloo itself the battalion was reduced to 300 men before the memorable charge took place.","Throughout the day, while an artillery duel had raged, the dead had lain out on the battlefield, and a long grave was dug for them by their comrades.","A patrol, sent out to get into communication with the Northamptons, had to take cover from the German artillery fire, which was so fierce that it was only in darkness they were able to return.","The actual route taken by the regiment, in the moves made by the British forces since the war began, can be traced pretty accurately by means of various personal accounts.","One day a section of men lay waist deep in water from nine in the morning till three in the afternoon, patiently waiting for dusk to come, that they might get a chance to dry their clothes.","They do their share.""","In a little more than two months the survivors of the battalion had their revenge at Paardeberg, when Cronje was forced to surrender with 4,000 men.","The Germans lost heavily, but were in very strong force, and at night the Seaforths drew back to get a rest.","After Walcheren, the Seaforths had little chance of winning distinction in the Napoleonic wars, but in 1819 and 1835 the regiment was engaged at the Cape in Kaffir wars, and the next incident of note in the history of the Seaforths was their work in the Mutiny, when they served under Havelock, marching from Allahabad to the relief of Cawnpur and Lucknow.","Later, they got into the trenches, where some of the men were standing knee-deep in water, and others were submerged up to their waists.","With the rest of the brigade the Argylls moved on to Paardeberg and the capture of Cronje and his force; and from that time onward to the end of the war the record of the battalion is one continuous story of marching, fighting, and the general work of the campaign, up to the time of the signing of peace at Vereeniging.","R. Bruce, Master of Burleigh, in the retreat from Mons.","There followed nineteen years of peace service, and then the Borderers were sent to Gibraltar as reinforcements, arriving in time to assist in the final discomfiture of the besieging force.","The offer was accepted, and Cameron raised 700 of his clansmen in Inverness-shire, a body which became the 79th Foot, and had its title altered in 1881 to the Cameron Highlanders.",Prominent among these were the Royal Scots.,"The first battalion was formed at Stirling in 1788 under Colonel Robert Abercromby, and was sent to India for fourteen years of active service in Mysore and Southern India.","But the glare of his rifle fire must have betrayed his position, for almost immediately he received another wound in the body, and this time it was a sufficiently serious matter to cause him to be sent home.","At about nine in the evening, however, a burial party set out to lay the dead commander to rest up on the face of a hill, near a large farmhouse which was the headquarters of the force for the time.","Their trenches were situated in a row on a rise in a field, and we could not get our range on them.",1.E.2.,"On one occasion Germans were seen walking between the trenches--their own and the British--carrying stretchers; and, under the assumption that they were carrying wounded, firing was stopped for the time.","Round about Mons the Gordons were heavily engaged, and found the German infantry firing weak, but their artillery work not to be despised.",There the story ends.,"Sleeping accommodation varied in quality and extent from night to night, ranging from a ploughed field or an orchard to the floor of a deserted house.","""The Germans generally cease operations at dusk, and on these occasions the same old order comes along the line--""Dig yourselves in, men.""","In his letter, as in all the accounts quoted here, is noticeable an absolute lack of doubt as to the final result of the titanic struggle.","In the Ashanti War the Black Watch took the leading and most conspicuous part, and shared in the capture and burning of Kumasi.","By means of such letters as these one may trace the regiment through the first, and in some respects the worst, of the fighting.","While in the trenches, and under a hot fire, Captain Price ran forward to help a corporal who had been shot in the arm, and in kindly fashion the captain was preventing the corporal from seeing his wound--shielding the injured arm while it was being dressed.","Circumstantial and bearing the impress of truth is the account of the doings of the regiment given by one Private Ward, who came home wounded from the Aisne.","The way in which his views of ""the conceited English"" altered as time went on is worthy of note.",One must sort out the various engagements mentioned and compare them with the official account of the first engagements in order to arrive at an estimate of the position in which the Seaforths began their fighting.,"I don't know what I would have done had not an officer passing in his motor seen me and taken me to the hospital.""","One wounded and captured German, placed in the next bed in hospital to a wounded Borderer, spoke broken English, and in the course of a chat was asked what he thought of the British.","But the youngster got little rest or respite in hospital, for the Germans shelled the hospital building, after their fashion, and the patients had to beat a quick retreat.","It was not until March of 1900 that the Camerons landed at East London to take part in the South African campaign, and they were then incorporated in the 21st Brigade under General Bruce Hamilton.","In 1780 the second battalion of the Black Watch was raised, to begin its active service in India.","It tells how the company had to charge the enemy out of his trenches at the bayonet point, which was done with some considerable loss of killed and wounded, and the writer comments--""There was not a coward among us.""","The men never wavered, and gaps were always filled.","CHAPTER VII THE SEAFORTH HIGHLANDERS The 1st battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders originally bore the number subsequently allotted to the 2nd battalion, for in 1778 the 1st battalion was raised as the 78th infantry of the line by the Earl of Seaforth, and with that as its official number it went to Jersey to defend the island against a French attack, and subsequently to India.","These distinctions were well earned, for the 78th defeated a force ten times as strong as itself in the course of the battle.","But, whatever may have happened in this way, there can be no doubt that the Royal Scots Fusiliers, of which the second battalion certainly took part in these battles, has maintained the honour of the regiment to the full, and such of its officers and men as have fallen have rendered good account of themselves.",With the aid of the 117th Battery of R.F.A.,But there are some newspaper errors in connection with this event which are almost amusing.,"""Chitral"" is one of the names emblazoned on the regimental colours, and in the Tirah campaign the Gordons won undying fame at the storming of the Dargai heights--which, however, was but one incident in seven months of strenuous fighting.","""They are big chaps, most of them, but have not got the heart for it,"" he observes.","The charge of the Camerons on the enemy's lines is a feat that has been often described, and Lieutenant-Colonel Leith's cry of ""Come on, 79th!""","Lord Macleod, after whom the regiment was named, was its first commanding officer, and under his command the original members of the 73rd went to Madras in 1780, their voyage lasting no less than twelve months.","It begins with the account of the adventures of a maxim-gun section during the first week of the war, as related by a man of the gun section who was invalided home very early in the campaign.","Then at Messina the Fusiliers alone were responsible for the capture of over a thousand officers and men out of a force which attempted to land there, and up to the time of the abdication of Napoleon the regiment was engaged in active service.","The brigade commander saw that if the enemy were given time to bring up heavy artillery they would render their own position impregnable and that of the British force untenable--the height had to be taken that day, if at all.","Almost immediately afterwards the retreat was continued, and according to one account the colonel was found lying wounded by the Germans.","Magersfontein was avenged at Paardeberg, where the Seaforths took part in the rounding up and capture of Cronje, following up this with the action at Poplar Grove and that of Driefontein.","The German bullet passed right across the Borderer's scalp, but in the firing line it was impossible to get immediate medical attention, and the wounded man had to be in the trench for hours before nightfall gave him the chance to get back to the field hospital under cover of darkness.","When there was any close fighting, and it came to using the cold steel, the Germans ran from them like hares.",Surely in this one incident is as great accusation against the German race as in the other and worse accounts.,"Such stories as this last are welcome, and form a relief from the numberless stories of German barbarity that have appeared.","On the whole, however, the writer conveys a very good idea of the work of those first few days--he was wounded in the retirement from Mons, and thus his narrative ceases there.","Concerning this action of the 14th of September, another participant tells that the British troops were steadily driving the Germans back, and the company of the Seaforths to which he belonged had crossed the river two days before, and were holding a ridge, though the enemy had a great advantage in point of numbers.","The regiment, known in old time as the ""Forty-second,"" was originally formed out of the independent companies raised in 1729 to keep the peace in the hills of the Scottish Highlands, and the first parade as a regiment took place near Aberfeldy in 1740, when the regiment was numbered ""43.""","They had their turn in the Mutiny, however, for they fought their way from Ambala to Delhi, and sat on the ""Ridge"" under great John Nicholson from June to September, taking part in the final assault and storming the Kashmir gate.","To come back to the real work of the regiment, a further account deals with the battle of the Aisne, where, on the 14th of September, the men occupied some high ground, and were discovered by the enemy, who set to work to render the position untenable by means of artillery fire.","The first of these accounts states that the Seaforths were first engaged at Agincourt, where an advance party of Germans took the regiment by surprise, and they were hotly engaged.","The retreat was a trap, for on the advance the two British battalions were subject to shell as well as rifle fire, and out of one section of fourteen men only one was left.","At that, ""the Germans did not wait to say 'Good night,' but simply ran, as they won't face the cold steel at any price.""","The stories quoted here form a fairly connected record of the work of the Black Watch up to the time of the battle on the Aisne; of what came after, there is as yet no definite record.","Not that they disprove the stories of brutality, but they go to show that the policy of ruthlessness is a calculated one, and that the individual German might be a kind-hearted man at times if his officers would let him.",and received several enthusiastic affirmatives.,"It was here that the Borderers were first made acquainted with the practice of fixing the bayonet alongside the muzzle of the musket instead of into it, for up to that time fixing bayonets had involved thrusting the bayonet into the barrel, when the weapon could not be fired.",Then the Seaforths took Ceylon from the Dutch.,"In 1793 the Borderers were transformed into Marines, in which capacity they came in for a share of the prize money accruing from the capture of a ship valued at a million sterling, and then took part in the victory won by Lord Howe over the French fleet at Brest.","Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this work or
