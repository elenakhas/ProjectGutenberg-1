the boy I had known for four years seemed suddenly transformed into a man who made me feel very young.,He was all the world.,"The idea of a tour without Stephens in the background seemed suddenly momentous, and the smile she gave him was more serious than she meant it to be.","""You will learn.""","There was a momentary silence in the room, and Diana became conscious of a muffled, rhythmical beat near her, like the ticking of a great clock, and realised with dull wonder that it was her own heart beating.","He pointed to the coffee that the woman had recommenced to make, her back turned to them, but Diana stamped her foot.",He was going to make the young man take his chance as the rough-rider had taken his.,I saw him only a few months ago when Aubrey and I passed through Paris.,"She had had nothing to eat all day, but the food nearly choked her and she could hardly swallow it, but she forced herself to eat a little.",Diana watched him interestedly.,She was useless to him.,"Terror, agonising, soul-shaking terror such as she had never imagined, took hold of her.","Monseigneur's horses are known through all the Barbary States, and as far as France,"" he added, with a little accent of pride creeping into his voice.","The little man rode magnificently, and put up a longer fight than the others had done, but at last his turn came, and he went flying over the colt's head.",Time to think of them when they came.,"""Forgive me, Raoul.",Diana read eagerly.,"""Coward!""","Diana had not seen him, and it was not until the traveller had been served with dinner in his own tent that the Sheik had sent the usual flowery message conveying what, though wrapped in honeyed words, amounted practically to a command that he should come to drink coffee and let himself be seen.",He ranged alongside of her now with a murmured apology.,"His hand slipped to her shoulder, his fingers gripping the delicate, rounded arm.","""In what way--real?""","His caresses had been careless and infrequent, and his indifference so great that she had wondered miserably if the flame of his passion for her was burning out and if this was the end.","She would not admit that there was any danger, though her heart was beating in a way that it had never done before.","""He hates the English.""",The flaming light of desire burning in his eyes turned her sick and faint.,"Did he wish her to crawl abjectly to his feet to give him the pleasure of spurning her contemptuously, or was it only that he wanted her senses merely to respond to his ardent, Eastern temperament?",His careless kisses would scorch her and the strength of his arms would be a mockery.,"She wrote a letter for her husband which she gave into my father's keeping, together with her wedding ring, which had an inscription inside of it, and a miniature of Glencaryll which she had worn always hidden away from sight.","She tried to keep silent, but the question was forced from her, and she waited tense for his answer.","""Forgive me,"" she murmured, her voice muffled in the rough, grey hair.","If he would only shout or bluster like the average angry man she felt that she could brave him longer, but the cold quiet rage that characterised him always was infinitely more sinister, and paralysed her with its silent force.",It was one of his cigarettes that she was smoking.,"Diana came forward slowly, a faint colour rising in her face.","And as she reached him the black horse dashed up alongside, stopping suddenly, and rearing straight up.","She remembered the noise, the fleeting vision she had had in the hotel at Biskra.",He motioned to the south with an impatient jerk of his head.,"He was stooping to light a cigarette from a match that Gaston was holding, and then they walked together nearer to the colt.","Even in speaking of it she insisted that the fault was hers, that the trouble was due to her stupidity, glossing over his brutality; in fact, it was not from her, but from inquiries that he made after her death, that my father learned most of what her life had been.","""What?","""Your pardon, Madame.","""Gaston!""",Would he live?,"But she knew herself at last and knew the love that filled her, an overwhelming, passionate love that almost frightened her with its immensity and with the sudden hold it had laid upon her.",His black brows drew together slowly.,"His curses had eaten into her heart, and she had fled from him to stifle the coward instinct that urged her to confess her love and beg his mercy.","He stood some time after Gaston had gone to his own quarters looking out into the night, and when he came in, lingered unusually over closing the flap.","Quite suddenly she knew--knew that she loved him, that she had loved him for a long time, even when she thought she hated him and when she had fled from him.","""How many men had Ahmed Ben Hassan in the camp in which he kept you?""","He was a brute, but she loved him, loved him for his very brutality and superb animal strength.",The day was wearing away quickly.,"She was sitting with her hand still clasped over the Sheik's and the other one shading her face, and the Vicomte went on speaking: ""It is so easy to judge, so difficult to understand another person's temptations.","""You must be very tired, Raoul,"" she said, slipping her hand through his arm, for her need was almost as much for physical as mental support.","""If he killed me he could not kill my love,"" she murmured, with a little pitiful smile.","Again the empty saddle was filled, and a curious hush came over the watching crowd.","She had heard tales before she left Biskra, and since then she had been living in an Arab camp, and she knew something of the fiendish cruelty and callous indifference to suffering of the Arabs.","She had seen enough in her short glimpse of the Arabs' tactics when they had passed her to know that she was dealing with a finished horseman on a perfectly trained horse, and that her idea could never succeed.","She could give no account of herself, as, owing to the effects of the sun or other causes, she was temporarily out of her mind.","She had hoped for an encampment, where there would be women or a caravan of traders whose constant communication with the towns would make them realise the importance of guiding her to civilisation unharmed.","Near her the Sheik with Gaston and Yusef stood watching a mad, ramping colt that was being held with difficulty by two or three men, who clung to him tenaciously in spite of his efforts to break away, and beyond was a semi-circle of Arabs, some mounted and some on foot, leaving a wide, open space between them and the tent."
