"In his most genial subsequent impressions of the place there was always a lingering [28] trace of that famous frost through which he made his way, wary of petrifying contact against things without, to the great western portal, on Candlemas morning.","What if the truest opinions were not always the most commodious to man, ""being of so wild a composition""?",The little panelled drawers were full of them.,Here and there a secular oak tree maintained a solitude around it.,"In about an hour's time they returned, not a little disconcerted, to tell a story of which Gaston was reminded (seeing them again in thought as if only half real, amid the bloomy night, with blood upon their boyish flowers) as they crossed his path afterwards at three intervals.",It was he who had led the others on this visit to Gaston de Latour.,"Looking back afterwards, this singularly self-possessed person had to confess that under its influence he had lost for a while the exacter view of certain outlines, certain real differences and oppositions of things in that hotly coloured world of Paris (like a shaken tapestry about him) awaiting the Eve of Saint Bartholomew.","They were prisoners like [46] the rest, Gaston and the grandparents, shut up in their little hotel; and Gaston, face to face with it, understood at last what war really means.","And still that was no dubious or generalised form it gave to flower or bird, but the exact pressure of the Jay at the window; you could count the petals,--of the exact natural number; no expression could be too faithful to the precise texture of things; words, too, must embroider, be twisted and spun, like silk or golden hair.","The incident in his life which opened for him the profoundest sources of regret and pity, shaped as it was in a measure by those greater historic movements, owed its tragic significance there to an unfriendly shadow precluding knowledge how certain facts had really gone, a shadow which veiled from others a particular act of his and the true character of its motives.","With what justice, by the way, had those Latin poets dealt with winter, and wintry charms, in their bland Italy!","From those first fair days of early Greek speculation, love had occupied a large place in the conception of philosophy; and in after days Bruno was fond of developing, like Plato, like the Christian Platonists, combining something of the peculiar temper of each, the analogy between the flights of intellectual enthusiasm and those of physical love, with an animation which shows clearly enough the reality of his experience in the latter.","For such as ""make it their business to oversee human actions, it seems impossible they should proceed from one and the same person.""",Yet a nature so opulently endowed can hardly have been lacking in purely physical or sensuous ardours.,"In the sudden tremor of an aged voice, the handling of a forgotten toy, a childish drawing, in the tacit observance of a day, he became aware suddenly of the great stream of human tears falling always through the shadows of the world.","PEACH-BLOSSOM AND WINE [73] Those searchings of mind brought from time to time cruel starts from sleep, a sudden shudder at any wide outlook over life and its issues, draughts of mental east-wind across the hot mornings, into which the voices of his companions called him, to lose again in long rambles every thought save that of his own firm, abounding youth.","Physical twilight we most of us love, in its season.","For him, as for Plato, for Socrates whom he cites so often, the essential dialogue was that of the mind with itself; but this dialogue throve best with, often actually needed, outward stimulus--physical motion, some text shot from a book, the queries and objections of a living voice.--""My thoughts sleep, if I sit still.""","And was it that Gaston too was a less independent ruler of his own mental world than he had fancied, that he derived his impressions of things not directly from them, but mediately from other people's impressions about them, and he needed the pledge of their assents to ratify his own?","Following a long period of quiet progress--the tranquil and tolerant years of the [16] Renaissance-- the religious war took possession of, and pushed to strangely confused issues, a society somewhat distraught by an artificial aesthetic culture; and filled with wild passions, wildly-dramatic personalities, a scene already singularly attractive by its artistic beauty.","The being whose one claim had lain in her incorrigible lightness, came to seem representative of the suffering of the whole world in its plenitude of piteous detail, in those unvalued caresses, that desire towards himself, that patient half- expressed claim not to be wholly despised, poignant now for ever.","Still, for the most part, in their perfect health, nothing seemed to reach them but their own boyish ordinances, their own arbitrary ""form.""","And what was the purport, what the justification, of this undissembled egotism?","There was Joseph's dream, with the tall sheaves of the elder brethren bowing to Joseph's sheaf, like these aged heads around the youthful aspirant of to-day.","And as for himself, the great poet, with his [63] bodily graces and airs of court, had always possessed the gift of pleasing those who encountered him.","Observance, loyal concurrence in some high purpose for him, passive waiting on the hand one might miss in the darkness, with the gift or gifts therein of which he had the presentiment, and upon the due acceptance of which the true fortune of life would turn; these were the hereditary traits alert in Gaston, as he lay awake in the absolute, moon-lit, stillness, his outward ear attentive for the wandering footsteps which, through that wide, lightly-accentuated country, often came and went about the house, with weird suggestions of a dim passage to and fro, and of an infinite distance.","Fortune, chance, that is to say, the incalculable contribution of mere matter to man, ""would still be mistress of events""; and one might think it no un-wisdom to commit everything to fortuity.","It was the chamber of Gabrielle de Latour, who had died of joy.",Immense distinction!,"How imperceptibly had darkness crept over them, effacing everything but the interior of [90] the great circular chamber, its book-shelves and enigmatic mottoes and the tapestry on the wall,--Circe and her sorceries, in many parts--to draw over the windows in winter.","The mind of Gaston, for one, was touched by the sense of some remote and delicate beauty in these things, like magicians' work, like an effect of magic as being extorted from unsuspected sources.","They had set out on foot, after a votive mass said early in the old chapel of the manor, to assist at the ceremony of the day.","Privately, in fact, Gaston had conceived of a poetry more thaumaturgic than could be anything of earlier standing than himself.","Looked at in this way, some of the well- [71] marked characteristics of the poetry of the Pleiad assumed a hieratic, almost an ecclesiastical air.","A crowd of worshippers filled the church of Sainte-Foy, built partly upon the ramparts; and at the conclusion of the mass, the Sacrament was to be carried to a sick person.","As to Gaston himself,--had this kindly entertainer only been drawing the screws of a very complex piece of machinery which had worked well enough hitherto for all practical purposes?--Was this all that had been going on, while he lingered there, week after week, in a kind of devout attendance on theories, and, for his part, feeling no reverberation of actual events around him, still less of great events in preparation?",Was this shrewd casuist only bringing him by a roundabout way to principles he would not have cared to avow?,"On his right hand a broad, lightly diversified expanse of vineyard, of towns and towers innumerable, rolled its burden of fat things down the slope of the Gironde towards the more perfect level beyond.","Fantastic humour seemed at its height in the institution of a new order of knighthood, the enigmatic splendours of which were to be a monument of Henry's superstitious care, or, as some said, of his impious contempt, of the day which had made him master of his destiny,--that great Church festival, towards the emphatic marking of which he was ever afterwards ready to welcome any novel or striking device for the spending of an hour.","Bright as the scene of his journey had been, it had had from time to time its grisly touches; a forbidden fortress with its steel-clad inmates thrust itself upon the way; the village church had been ruined too recently to count as picturesque; and at last, at the meeting-point of [81] five long causeways across a wide expanse of marshland, where the wholesome sea turned stagnant, La Rochelle itself scowled through the heavy air, the dark ramparts still rising higher around its dark townsfolk:--La Rochelle, the ""Bastion of the Gospel"" according to John Calvin, the conceded capital of the Huguenots.","Yet a less than Machiavellian cunning might perhaps have detected, amid all this sudden fraternity--as in some unseasonably fine weather signs of coming distress--a risky element of exaggeration in those precipitately patched-up amities, a certain hollow ring in those improbable religious conversions, those unlikely reconciliations in what was after all an age of treachery as a fine art.",His own egotism was but the pattern of the true intellectual life of every one.,Monsieur Michel could tell him much of the great ones--of the Greek and Latin masters of style.,"From the same hands, in due order, the fair surplice ripples down over him.",Ah!,"He was in truth but ""love's secretary,"" noting from hour to hour its minutely changing fortunes.","It was the invincible nature of the royal lad to speak, and feel, on these mad, alto notes, and not unbecoming in a good catholic; for Huguenots never swore, and these were subtly theological oaths.","Yet, again, even on this ultimate ground of judgment, what undulancy, complexity, surprises!--""I have no other end in writing but to discover myself, who also shall peradventure be another thing to- morrow.""","It was such a coloured thing; though the grey things also, the cool things, all the fresher for the contrast--with a freshness, again, that seemed to touch and cool the soul--found their account [55] there; the clangorous passage of the birds at night foretokening rain, the moan of the wind at the door, the wind's self made visible over the yielding corn.","In mid-distance, even then a funeral procession was on its way humbly to one of the village churchyards.","Through repeated dangers good-fortune has saved that unrivalled treasure of stained glass; and then, as now, the word ""awful,"" so often applied to Gothic aisles, was for once really applicable.","And yet, with all their gaiety, as its last triumphant note in truth, they were ready to trifle with death, welcoming, by way of a foil to the easy character of their days, a certain luxurious sense of danger--the night-alarm, the arquebuse peeping from some quiet farm-building across their way, the rumoured presence in their neighbourhood of this or that great military leader--delightful premonitions of the adventurous life soon to be their own in Paris.","Only, could that, after all, be a real sun, at which other people's faces were not irradiated?","And one result, certainly, of this constant prepossession was, that it kept him on the alert concerning theories of the divine assistance to man, and the world,--theories of inspiration.","also the treachery, of the public event seemed to identify themselves tragically with his own personal action.","Conscious of that rudeness in his home, and feeding a strong natural instinct for outward beauty hitherto on what was barely sufficient, he found for himself in this perfumed place the centre of a fanciful world, reaching out to who could tell what refined passages of existence in that great world beyond, of which the echoes seemed to light here amid the stillness.","In nature, indeed, as in one's self, there might be no ultimate inconsequence: only, ""the soul looks upon things with another eye, and represents them to itself with another kind of face: for everything has many faces and several aspects.","The weak would but suffer somewhat more than was usual, in the interest of the strong.","Was there anything better, fairer, than the beautiful light of health?","a new religion, or at least a new worship, maintaining and visibly setting forth a single overpowering apprehension.","Here, truly, was a doctrine to propagate, a secret open to every one who would learn, towards a new management of life,--nay!","The work, by its own force and fortune, sometimes outstrips the workman.",and what counsellors be they who have given him this advice?,"A few years were still to pass ere sacrilegious hands despoiled it on a religious pretext:--the catholic church must pay, even with the molten gold of her sanctuaries, the price of her defence in the civil war.","So much the larger was the fund of superfluous affection which went forth, with a delicacy not less than their own, to meet the sympathies of the aged people who cherished him.",That had remained with him as his one fixed standard of value in the estimate of men and things.,"THE LOWER PANTHEISM      Jetzo, da ich ausgewachsen,      Viel gelesen, viel gereist,      Schwillt mein Herz, und ganz von Herzen,      Glaub' ich an den Heilgen Geist.--HEINE.+ [132] Those who were curious to trace the symmetries of chance or destiny felt now quite secure in observing that, of nine French kings of the name, every third Charles had been a madman.","An abundance of almost life-sized sculpture clung to the pillars, lurked in the angles, seemed, with those symbolical gestures, and mystic faces [6] ready to speak their parts, to be almost in motion through the gloom.",que j'ai eu un meschant conseil!,"even running headlong upon it, with [92] a real affection""?","More truly commendable was the custom of the Lacedaemonians, who when they went to battle sacrificed always to the Muses, that ""these might, by their sweetness and gaiety, soften martial fury.""",So it seemed likely to be with Gaston de Latour.,"As for me, I never see all of anything; neither do they who so largely promise to show it to others.","The master's wistful tolerance, so [114] extraordinary a characteristic in that age, attracted him, in his present humour, not so much in connexion with those problematic heavenly lights that might find their way to one from infinite skies, as with the pleasant, quite finite, objects and experiences of the indubitable world of sense, so close around him.","It was the perfect stroke of Catherine's policy, the secret of her predominance over her sons, thus, with a flight of purchaseable fair women ever at command, to maintain perpetual holiday, perpetual idleness, with consequent perpetual, most often idle, thoughts about marriage, amid which the actual conduct of affairs would be left to herself.",Gaston in half an hour seemed to have known his entertainer all his life.,"when his name is called, and advances manfully; though he kneels meekly enough, and remains, with his head bowed forward, at the knees of the seated bishop who recites the appointed prayers, between the anthems and responses of his Schola, or attendant singers--Might he be saved from mental blindness!","The letter for Monsieur Michel de Montaigne was to hand, with preparations for the distant journey which must presently break up their comradeship.","That rigid correctness; that gracious unction, as of the medieval Latin psalmody; that aspiring fervour; that jealousy of the profane ""vulgar""; the sense, flattering to one who was in the secret, that this thing, even in its utmost triumph, could never be really popular:--why were these so welcome to him but from the continuity of early mental habit?","Still, at Deux-manoirs, this warfare, seething up from time to time so wildly in this or that district of France, was for the most part only sensible in incidents we might think picturesque, were they told with that intention; delightful enough, certainly, to the curiosity of a boy, in whose [19] mind nevertheless they deepened a native impressibility to the sorrow and hazard that are constant and necessary in human life, especially for the poor.","I am betimes sensible of the little breezes that begin to sing and whistle in the shrouds, the forerunners of the storm.--When I walk alone in a beautiful orchard, if my thoughts are for a while taken up with foreign occurrences, I some part of the time call them back again to my walk, to the orchard, to the sweetness of the solitude, and to myself.--There is nothing in us either purely corporeal, or purely spiritual.",VII.,"For the prevention of which conspiracy the king enjoined the Provost to possess himself [127] of the keys of the various city gates, and seize all boats plying on the river, to the end that none might enter or depart."""
