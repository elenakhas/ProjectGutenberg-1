"It was a still, sunny, drowsy afternoon, and scarcely a soul was visible in the length and breadth of the street.",said the trumpet- major to Anne as they retired from the old man.,'Don't know--how is that?',"'Thinks I, there's no knowing what I may do to shock her, so I'll take my solid victuals in the bakehouse, and only a crumb and a drop in her company for manners.'",said the miller reproachfully.,'That's how you play with me!',"'I _am_ out for a walk, captain,' said the lady, who had criticized him from the crevice of her eye, without seeming to do much more than continue her demure look forward, and gave the title as a sop to his apparent character.",'Yes?,"'Now, didn't you think highly of her, Miss Garland?'","She ran and dipped her handkerchief into the splashing mill-tail, and with it damped Matilda's face.","On getting close they found that the shutters of all the lower windows were closed, but on trying the door it opened to the hand.","He helped her to the slope indicated, and continued, still as if his thoughts were more occupied with the mystery of her recent situation than with what he was saying: 'We arrived at Budmouth Barracks this morning, and are to lie there all the summer.",Festus was curious enough to descend and look at the marks.,'And not care about me at all?',"The jolting here was most distressing, and seemed about to snap the springs.","Bob then opened his tale in order, relating graphically the conversation to which he had been a party, and they listened with breathless attention.","'No rattling dinners at Stacie's Hotel, and the King below with his staff.","As Associated Volunteers you will be called out only once a week,    unless the actual Landing of the Enemy should render your further    Services necessary.","'If you don't, upon my life I will throw it out to the first beggar I see.",he said.,"'I might ask for you, Loveday,' said the captain thoughtfully, 'and so get you there that way.","When Cornick was gone, Festus, instead of passing straight on, halted on the little bridge and meditated.","She must have carried her box with her own hands, poor girl.","'Since you have been gone,' he said, 'a Government man has been here, and to all the houses, taking down the numbers of the women and children, and their ages and the number of horses and waggons that can be mustered, in case they have to retreat inland, out of the way of the invading army.'","John admitted that it was getting to feel like summer: and, bending his gaze upon her with an earnestness which no longer left any doubt of his subject, went on to ask-- 'Have you ever in these last weeks thought of how it used to be between us?'","'It is not right to talk so lightly at such a serious time,' she thoughtfully returned, going on towards the church.","'I have nothing to say, sir.","Captain Hardy may be depended upon for that; he knows every current about here, being a native.'","As she neared the mill an erect figure with a blue body and white thighs descended before her from the down towards the village, and went past the mill to a stile beyond, over which she usually returned to her house.","'Well, we have only to tell him that Loveday is a seaman to be clear of him this very night.'",'That's John!',shouted Bob.,'I cannot come to see it.,She little thinks I have kept an account of 'em all.',"Nobody was within; the house appeared to have been abandoned in some confusion, and the probability was that the shepherd had fled on hearing the alarm.","'O no--that's nothing,' said John hastily.",halt!,"His mind was in such a state that he derived no pleasure even from Anne Garland's presence, though he held a corner of the same book with her, and was treated in a winsome way which it was not her usual practice to indulge in.","cried Anne, jumping up and laughing, in her relief.","They breathed rather than spoke their thankfulness and relief, the miller's eyes being moist as he turned aside to calm himself; while Anne, having first jumped up wildly from her seat, sank back again under the almost insupportable joy that trembled through her limbs to her utmost finger.",I must assemble with the company.',"said the miller, his tasselled nightcap appearing in the opening.","Derriman went to the corner of the cellar, and pulled out a clamped box from under the straw.","Why, she turned colour and nearly fainted away.","You begin to look pale, man.'","There was no water to be had, and he could think of nothing else but to hold her tenderly till she came round again.","Her eyes would have been called brown, but they were really eel-colour, like many other nice brown eyes; they were well-shaped and rather bright, though they had more of a broad shine than a sparkle.","Wandering up and down the pavement, or leaning against some hot wall between the waggon-office and the corner of the street above, he passed the time away.","At last the miller said, 'Well, really, Bob, I'm hungry; we must begin without her.'","'But we can see him,' replied Anne, 'and notice by his face which of them it is he is so charmed with.","You and Anne and the maid must be off to Cousin Jim's at King's-Bere, and when you get there you must do as they do.","Not wishing to alarm Anne and her mother, the miller assured them that Bob and himself were merely going out of doors to inquire into the cause of the report, after which they plunged into the gloom together.",'Bless your dear old heart for being so anxious!,Until this moment he had been in utter ignorance of the theatrical company and all that pertained to it.,'Well?',Anne started off at a run.,'Of course!',The French will be here within two months; that's certain.,I hope my return to faithfulness will make no    difference to you.,At the beginning of autumn John brought news which fearfully depressed her.,'Just a word now and then.',"He saw her face enter the beam of candlelight, stay there for a moment, and quickly withdraw.","Not far from this came Nettlecombe Tout; to the west, Dogberry Hill, and Black'on near to the foreground, the beacon thereon being built of furze faggots thatched with straw, and standing on the spot where the monument now raises its head.","The ludicrous humility of his manner led her to add playfully over her shoulder, 'It serves you right, you know.'","I am sure you ought to accept some one gift, dear, out of compliment to those old times!'","'Ah!--I know your father,' cried the trumpet-major, 'old James Cornick.'",Duels?,We will let it be buried in eternal mixens of forgetfulness.',Many and many a time have I stood by your poor father while he worked.,"Anne took the glass, and he supported it by his arm.","'He is coming home _to be married_,' said the trumpet-major, without looking up.",The waggon contained all Derriman's workpeople.,'Have you heard anything new?',Anne did not speak.,.,You'll find a store of them ready in the corner of the church tower.,See how they tilt 'em on the two back legs--and that's ruin to a chair!,'O no.,'Down here?','Just let me know your whole mind.,"Neighbours' minds had become so saturated by the abundance of showy military and regal incident lately vouchsafed to them, that the wedding of middle-aged civilians was of small account, excepting in so far that it solved the question whether or not Mrs. Garland would consider herself too genteel to mate with a grinder of corn.","'But if I was you two, I should drive home-along straight and quiet; and be very busy in the mill all to-morrow, Mr.",Amidst mumblings and curses the gang descended the pair of ladders and came into the open air; but Captain Bob was nowhere to be seen.
