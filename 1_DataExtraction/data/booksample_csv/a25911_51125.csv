"It would help me to smash Wendel in a legal way, which is always the best way, when backed up as it would have to be by armed, completely lawful authority.",She nodded.,"It shouldn't have surprised me too much, because of what she'd said to the doctor.",But it was just as well to be on the completely safe side.,"The Spaceport's in the other direction, completely isolated.","But only the two giants--Wendel Atomics and Endicott Fuel--have fought each other to a standstill and threaten the peace, and stability of the entire colony.","And that's even more true of a hospital patient who has been close to death and running a fever and may still be in an irresponsible state, his reason undermined by the suffering he's undergone.",And for our lives as well.,Or any kind of propaganda.,"In the maze of a hundred legends, a hundred witness-confirmed stories of triumph and disappointment, of heroic progress and tragic back-tracking, it had remained an important link between Earthside expectations and what was actually taking place on Mars.","""Yes ...","A saluting guard stepped back and what was perhaps the narrowest, least impressive door in the entire building opened and closed and I found myself in his presence.","""Well ... he could have recognized her,"" I said.",So ... to hell with it ...,"I could tell by the dull, unseeing glaze which had over-spread his pupils and the terrible stillness which had come upon him.",I hoped Joan wouldn't mind if she ever got to hear about it.,"""The impossible?""","The significance of that finely-wrought, seldom-worn silver bird was not lost on me.","It wasn't surprising, because the agony was still with me and I saw everything in fitful starts, in brief flashes, between bouts of blacking out and coming to and blacking out again.",I came out into the biggest square I'd ever seen.,"The colonization of Mars is a tribute to Man's stubborn refusal to be easily discouraged or to let mechanical difficulties, no matter how formidable, stand in his way.",The robots were a story in themselves--a story that could bear a great deal of re-telling.,"I'd have said it couldn't be done ... and so would you, I'm sure, because you're as familiar with the inspection routine as I am.","It's hard to tell what a man looks like anyway, when he's facing away from you, and you can only see his disappearing shoulders and the back of his head.",If you'd seen the look on his face and the way he was twisting her wrist you'd have been sure as I was that he was quite capable of killing her.,"It was still a very big _if_, but the questions were just as vital, and were directly tied in with it.",But I was sure that if it hadn't she'd have gone right on retreating backwards until she either started screaming again or crumpled to the floor in a dead faint.,"""But there's no sense in your reading this.","""That explosion was miles from here,"" he went on breathlessly, ""but it lifted the tractor right off the ground, treads and all, for a second.",Their eyes are slitted and they're stripped to the waist and there is a fine sheen of sweat on their chests.,"I shut and locked the front door and almost called out: ""It's me, darling!""",It will make you feel better.,"Mr. Big hadn't even mentioned Joan in the ugly little talk I'd had with him, and if she was still somewhere in the hospital I had a feeling he'd have used her nearness as one more way of tightening the thumbscrew.",Of course I was being unfair to her.,"But I didn't even pause to weigh them, because right up to that minute I'd done very well, and the fear which had come upon me had been as brief as an autumnal flurry of wind when you're coming around a tall building at breakneck speed.","You're seated all alone in the middle of what looks like a medieval torture chamber--if you leave out the racks and thumbscrews and iron maidens and just think of such a chamber as a blank-walled, cell-like horror--and on the screen, fifty or a hundred times lifesize, are the lads who have been given the task of cutting you down to size.","I no longer wanted to permanently demolish him, now that she'd broken free.","In a way, it's like the serpent you see in bas-reliefs dating back three thousand years, in Babylonian and Pre-Dynastic Egyptian tombs, for instance, or on totem poles in the Northwest ... a serpent that's continually swallowing its own tail.","""No,"" she said, answering me in full a half-minute later, when the door of the hospital room had been firmly closed behind us and we were committed to the big risk and there could be no turning back.","Only ... a little moderation even in people who go all out can be a saving grace.""","But you weren't that weak, and you're not going to die.","""I've every right.","It shouldn't be too difficult, because there's a seeing eye that hovers over the Mars' Colony day and night.","I'm not defending the Wendel monopoly, understand.",I can't even tell you his name.,She shut the book abruptly and straightened in her chair.,"""But only to get ... something I didn't want you to find.","He was there, all right.","He was saying ""Nurse this,"" and ""Nurse that"" and speaking with crisp authority, as if there was a gulf between a nurse and a doctor which even the kindliest, least hidebound of physicians had no right to ignore.",We passed a doctor in a smock so spotless it didn't seem as if he could have been wearing it for longer than a few minutes.,"We had several very serious things to discuss, because five hours had passed since I'd sat facing him in the same chair and Helen Barclay had sat in another chair at right angles to a third chair, which he had drawn out from his desk and occupied for a full hour without a coffee break, his eyes searching her face as she talked.","Or Smith, or Jones.","No combine is wealthy enough to undertake that kind of two-pronged enterprise.""","A deep, lustrous brown.","You don't know how many corridors there are, or how many alarm bells will start ringing the instant anyone sees you.","They were still the weakest part of me, but they went right on supporting me until I'd finished clouting him with something that was just as good as a sledgehammer--the firm wall itself, completely stationary as it was.",But remember this.,"When he killed me--God, how easy it was to overlook the most vital things!","""That's what it boils down to.",On Mars bringing that about shouldn't be too difficult ... with Wendel Atomics determined to build up a reputation for ruthlessness to protect its interests in the war it was waging with Endicott Fuel and all of the colonists who were being forced to wildcat in a commodity field so explosive that it could turn them into killers of the dream and blow them apart for good measure.,"""That's right,"" I said.","Not straight off, anyway--not until I knew much more than I did, and all of the big, vital questions had been answered with candor and I could go right on feeling the way I did about her with a clear conscience.","""It will always be stopped in the end, I think--if you have enough moral courage.",Just the fact that you're the only one who knows what would happen if I don't get out of here fast would be better news--the best there is.,"""There's no desert to cross,"" she said.",Sure he had.,"But when a full minute passed and the darkness held, and he didn't say a word, when I couldn't even hear him breathing, I began to grow uneasy.",and snapped the box open.,"I could picture him saying instead: ""Ralph, even an armed car can be blown up.","""Dr. Crawford says you mustn't try to talk.","Wendel knew that the Board was sending someone to Mars to investigate the combine, a man who couldn't be bribed to shut his eyes to what he was sure to see here.","""Don't annoy your father with questions now, Thomas ... please,"" Grace Lynton said.",I was out of danger now and beginning to mend and that was the only thing that counted.,Even if you're alone in a steel-walled vault it's a dangerous question to ask.,"""If he was trailing her he could have suspected she might be on board and may have been searching everywhere for her,"" Littlefield pointed out.",But she was going to Mars because of something that Wendel Atomics had done.,"The long line of tractors was still there, too.",But it was like the Old West in a good many other ways.,"""Well, it isn't the best job in the world, Buster, as I guess you've found out already.","In that massive, almost half-mile-long building, on every floor, there were guards who knew me and guards who had never set eyes on me before.",I was sure of that.,It's just not true.,"He was starting for the door when Grace Lynton called out warningly: ""John, don't!"
