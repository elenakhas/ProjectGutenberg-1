"Turn the man out by an actual thrusting I could not; to drive him away by calling him hard names would not do; calling in the police was an unpleasant idea; and yet, permit him to enjoy his cadaverous triumph over me,--this too I could not think of.",No reply.,"""I would prefer not to.""","A few days after this, my other clerks being absent, and being in a great hurry to dispatch certain letters by the mail, I thought that, having nothing else earthly to do, Bartleby would surely be less inflexible than usual, and carry these letters to the post-office.","Ere revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I first simply suggested to Bartleby the propriety of his permanent departure.","Throughout, the scrivener remained standing behind the screen, which I directed to be removed the last thing.",I felt additional incentives tempting me to my fate.,"""That's the man--here he comes,"" cried the foremost one, whom I recognized as the lawyer who had previously called upon me alone.",you will not dishonor yourself by such cruelty?,"Nay, that was out of the question.","Why,"" I added, unaffectedly starting, ""you have not even touched that money yet,"" pointing to it, just where I had left it the evening previous.","""Will you tell me _any thing_ about yourself?""","To all appearance, I thought they did.",Was any thing amiss going on?,Yet a certain melancholy mixed with this: I was almost sorry for my brilliant success.,I began to reason with him.,He remained silent.,"""What earthly right have you to stay here?","""You are decided, then, not to comply with my request--a request made according to common usage and common sense?""","""But what reasonable objection can you have to speak to me?","Though to be sure, when I reflected upon it, it was not strange that people entering my office should be struck by the peculiar aspect of the unaccountable Bartleby, and so be tempted to throw out some sinister observations concerning him.","""I would prefer to be left alone here,"" said Bartleby, as if offended at being mobbed in his privacy.","But there was something about Bartleby that not only strangely disarmed me, but in a wonderful manner touched and disconcerted me.","After a few words touching his qualifications, I engaged him, glad to have among my corps of copyists a man of so singularly sedate an aspect, which I thought might operate beneficially upon the flighty temper of Turkey, and the fiery one of Nippers.",What then will you do?,"In a brief word or two, he moreover added, that perhaps I had better walk round the block two or three times, and by that time he would probably have concluded his affairs.","A few days after this, Bartleby concluded four lengthy documents, being quadruplicates of a week's testimony taken before me in my High Court of Chancery.","But he seemed alone, absolutely alone in the universe.","what does conscience say I _should_ do with this man, or rather ghost.",He would be the last man to sit down to his desk in any state approaching to nudity.,"I am pained, Bartleby.","Am I not right?""",He must be gone.,"If hereafter in your new place of abode I can be of any service to you, do not fail to advise me by letter.","""I would prefer not to,"" he said, and gently disappeared behind the screen.","""Bartleby,"" said I, in the kindest tone I could assume under such exciting circumstances, ""will you go home with me now--not to my office, but my dwelling--and remain there till we can conclude upon some convenient arrangement for you at our leisure?",But he made no motion.,"I mean no mischief, seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity, thought I; besides, the desk is mine, and its contents too, so I will make bold to look within.",oh yes--queer word.,"As if long famishing for something to copy, he seemed to gorge himself on my documents.","Shall I go and black his eyes?""",I then begged to have an interview.,"As soon as tranquility returned I distinctly perceived that I had now done all that I possibly could, both in respect to the demands of the landlord and his tenants, and with regard to my own desire and sense of duty, to benefit Bartleby, and shield him from rude persecution.","""At present I prefer to give no answer,"" he said, and retired into his hermitage.","""Bartleby,"" said I, ""I owe you twelve dollars on account;
