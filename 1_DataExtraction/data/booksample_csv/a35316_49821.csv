They tended to travel too far too soon and get outside the lump of uranium too easily.,"Until about 1900, no one suspected the existence of nuclear energy.","The explosion was sure to be millions of times as powerful as ordinary chemical explosions involving the same quantity of exploding material, since the latter used only the electromagnetic interaction, while the former used the much stronger nuclear interaction.",Could a chain reaction capable of producing energy (for useful purposes as well as for bombs) be established?,Surely that would be the ultimate energy source.,"If so, it is not impossible that eventually man’s restless brain may come to understand and even utilize it.",Even as the walls heat up they liberate some of their own atoms into the plasma and introduce impurities that will prevent the fusion reaction.,"Suppose one had 2 slabs of enriched uranium, each below critical size, but which were above critical size if combined.",There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.,"Still, Dirac’s original theory of antiparticles was not confined to electrons.","_Wilhelm Roentgen and the Discovery of X Rays_, Bern Dibner, Franklin   Watts, Inc., New York, 1968, 149 pp., $2.95.","Barium, however, had an atomic number of 56, only a little over half that of uranium.","Roosevelt,   President of the United States,   White House   Washington, D.C.
