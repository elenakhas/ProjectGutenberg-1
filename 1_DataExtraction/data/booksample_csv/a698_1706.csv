He used some striking illustrations of the effect of light and the position of the eye upon colors.,"We see how Lilly, an opponent of the king, made his so-called prophecy of the disaster of the king and his army.","There is reason to believe, however, that while Roberval's discovery was made before Torricelli's, the latter reached his conclusions independently.","Possibly the dying away of ripples in water may have furnished, by analogy, an explanation of the gradual dying out of the impulse which propels the stone.","To refute this theory, and to show instances to the contrary, Boyle, among other things, shows that various colors--blue, red, yellow--may be produced upon tempered steel, and yet the metal within ""a hair's-breadth of its surface"" have none of these colors.","These studies were associated with observations on projectiles, regarding which Galileo was the first to entertain correct notions.","These discoveries very naturally aroused all manner of doubt and criticism, which in turn helped in the development of independent thought.",He was led to this demonstration through considering the orbital motion of the moon.,"""I did,"" he says, ""embrace at the beginning these doctrines, as my adversaries (followers of Galen) have done, but since I saw that from their procedures nothing resulted but death, murder, stranglings, anchylosed limbs, paralysis, and so forth, that they held most diseases incurable.... therefore have I quitted this wretched art, and sought for truth in any other direction.","All his writings aim to promote progress in medicine, and to hold before the physician a grand ideal of his profession.","Encouraged by these offers, a certain carpenter named Harrison turned his attention to the subject of watch-making, and, after many years of labor, in 1758 produced a spring time-keeper which, during a sea-voyage occupying one hundred and sixty-one days, varied only one minute and five seconds.","And although Musschenbroek is sometimes credited with being the discoverer, there can be no doubt that Von Kleist's discovery antedated his by a few months at least.","But, without all doubt, the nature of gravity towards the planets is the same as towards the earth.","""(4) This conclusive demonstration that the veins return the blood to the heart must have been most impressive to Harvey, who had been taught to believe that the blood current in the veins pursued an opposite course, and must have tended to shake his faith in all existing doctrines of the day.","Bacon, as the earliest path-breaker, showed the way, theoretically at least, in which the sciences should be studied; Descartes, pursuing the methods pointed out by Bacon, carried the same line of abstract reason into practice as well; while Leibnitz, coming some years later, and having the advantage of the wisdom of his two great predecessors, was naturally influenced by both in his views of abstract scientific principles.","A person born when the Sun is in any of the latter degrees of Taurus, say the twenty-fifth degree, will have a small, sharp, weak chin, curved up towards Gemini, the two vertical lines on the upper lip.","We shall see presently, however, that some twenty years later an English scientist dispelled this illusion by producing both positive (or vitreous) and negative (or resinous) electricity on the same tube of glass at the same time.","Here again, however, the point of view of each individual plays the governing part in determining the importance of such a document.","There is reason to believe that he based his generalizations on the experiment of Snell, though he did not openly acknowledge his indebtedness.",wilt thou say.,"These deductions seem the more wonderful because at the time he made them the dip had just been discovered, and had not been studied except at London.","After the death of Charles I., Lilly admitted that the monarch had given him a thousand pounds to cast his horoscope.","The disputed nationality of Copernicus strongly suggests that he came of a mixed racial lineage, and we are reminded again of the influences of those ethnical minglings to which we have previously more than once referred.","Gold was looked upon as the most perfect metal, and all other metals imperfect, because not yet ""purified.""","If I had said that the universe does not move on account of the impotence of its ruler, I should have been wrong and your rebuke would have been in order.","In this interpretation, not in his mere observations, lay the secret of his success.","He had shown the fallibility of many of the teachings of the hitherto standard methods of treating diseases, and had demonstrated the advantages of independent reasoning based on observation.","It was, therefore, a reckless alchemist indeed who dared boast that he had made the coveted discovery.",WILLIAM GILBERT AND THE STUDY OF MAGNETISM It will be observed that the studies of Galileo and Stevinus were chiefly concerned with the force of gravitation.,"He reintroduced the use of the ligature in controlling hemorrhage, introduced the ""figure of eight"" suture in the operation for hare-lip, improved many of the medico-legal doctrines, and advanced the practice of surgery generally.","""O all you Emperors, Kings, Princes, Rulers and Magistrates of Europe, this unaccustomed Apparition is like the Handwriting in Daniel to some of you; it premonisheth you, above all other people, to make your peace with God in time.","As illustrating the accuracy of Tycho's observations, it may be noted that he rediscovered a third inequality of the moon's motion at its variation, he, in common with other European astronomers, being then quite unaware that this inequality had been observed by an Arabian astronomer.","The greater the sphere is in such a case, so much longer is the time required for its revolution; the smaller the sphere the shorter the time.","To satisfy all these doubts I have contrived the following experiment to demonstrate how truly the air does support these bodies; for I have found, when one of these bodies which floats when placed lightly on the water is thoroughly bathed and sunk to the bottom, that by carrying down to it a little air without otherwise touching it in the least, I am able to raise and carry it back to the top, where it floats as before.","However, the little flaw in the otherwise complete demonstration of Harvey detracts nothing from the main issue at stake.",To make such a statement to-day seems not unlike the sober announcement that the earth is round or that the sun does not revolve about it.,The squares of the distance of the various planets from the sun are proportional to the cubes of their periods of revolution about the sun.,"The arguments contained in these pamphlets are very much the same as those of the astrologers three hundred years ago, except that they lack the quaint form of wording which is one of the features that lends interest to the older documents.","Such an estimate, however, is a manifest exaggeration of the facts, although there is probably a grain of truth in it withal.","Although Huygens's report was received last, he was anticipated by such a brief space of time, and his views are so clearly stated--on the whole rather more so than those of the other two--that we give them in part here: ""1.","For example, it was useless to give the stomach of an ox in gastric diseases when the indication in such cases was really for the stomach of a rat.","These exhibitions aroused the interest of the kings and noblemen, so that electricity no longer remained a ""plaything of the philosophers"" alone, but of kings as well.","Even in the best quadrant with a plain sight, therefore, the altitude must be uncertain by that quantity.","And it should be recalled that Antony von Leeuwenhoek, whose death took place shortly before Newton's, had discovered such micro-organisms as bacteria, had seen the blood corpuscles in circulation, and examined and described other microscopic structures of the body.","With the aid of his telescope, Galileo saw that Venus, for example, passes through phases precisely similar to those of the moon, due, of course, to the same cause.",The sum of the products arising from multiplying the mass of any hard body into the squares of its velocity is the same both before and after the stroke.,Two forms of pseudo-science were peculiarly prevalent--alchemy and astrology.,"But while the medical science of the Mohammedans greatly overshadowed that of the Christians during this period, it did not completely obliterate it.","But this fact, which is expressed in what we now term the first law of motion, was extremely difficult to grasp.","In this experiment Watson discovered the superiority of wire over chain as a conductor, rightly ascribing this superiority to the continuity of the metal.","These laws of planetary motion were vastly important as corroborating the Copernican theory of the universe, though their position in this regard was not immediately recognized by contemporary thinkers.","Even if the astronomer himself did not believe this, some of his superstitious admirers would; for to the unscientific mind predictions of earthly events would surely seem no more miraculous than correct predictions as to the future movements of the sun, moon, and stars.","The regular list of studies that came to be adopted everywhere comprised seven nominal branches, divided into two groups--the so-called quadrivium, comprising music, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy; and the trivium comprising grammar, rhetoric, and logic.","He believed the whole body to be controlled by an archaeus influus, the soul by the archaei insiti, and these in turn controlled by the central archeus.","He also introduced a thermometer which he advocated as valuable in cases of fever, but the instrument was probably not his own invention, but borrowed from his friend Galileo.","When this communication was made public, it proved to be an explanation of the discovery of the composition of white light.","In these experiments, however, Leonardo seems to have advanced little beyond Hero of Alexandria and his steam toy.","In short, every-day experience gives us illustrations of what might be called compound motion, which makes it seem altogether plausible that, if the earth is in motion, objects at its surface will partake of that motion in a way that does not interfere with any other movements to which they may be subjected.","""'I regret,' replied the astrologer, in answer to this inquiry, 'to be the herald of ill, though TRUE, fortune; your sojourn on earth will be short.'","There, as every one knows, he disavowed any intention to oppose the teachings of Scripture, and formally renounced the heretical doctrine of the earth's motion.","Boyle's notions of the exact chemical action in these phenomena were of course vague and indefinite, but he had observed that some part was played by the air, and he was right in supposing that the air ""may have a great share in varying the salts obtainable from calcined vitriol.","Unfortunately, however, there are good grounds for doubting that he was particularly influential in reintroducing these medicines.","But now, of course, a much more simple mechanism sufficed to explain the planetary motions, since the orbits were correctly referred to the central sun and not to the earth.","""The astrologer complied with the request of the mysterious visitor, drew forth his tables, consulted his ephemeris, and cast the horoscope or celestial map for the hour and the moment of the inquiry, according to the established rules of his art.","Those stars, namely, which were at the equator two thousand years ago, and hence described great circles in their revolutions, must to-day move more slowly and in smaller circles, because they are many degrees removed from it.","According to the familiar story, which has become one of the classic myths of science, Newton was led to take up the problem through observing the fall of an apple.","During the three years he became more and more convinced that science was not being studied in a profitable manner, until at last, at the end of his college course, he made ready to renounce the old Aristotelian methods of study and advance his theory of inductive study.","This principle very naturally explains why the ends of threads of silk or wool recede from each other, in the form of pencil or broom, when they have acquired an electric quality.","And, indeed, if here and there a man might have risen to such an appreciation, there were abundant reasons for the repression of the impulse, for there was nothing humorous about the response with which the authorities of the time were wont to meet the expression of iconoclastic opinions.","For it should be remembered that the return of the blood by the veins was unknown, and nothing like a ""circulation"" more than vaguely conceived even by Harvey himself.","One of the most bitter of these contests was over the question of ""revulsion,"" and ""derivation""--that is, whether in cases of pleurisy treated by bleeding, the venesection should be made at a point distant from the seat of the disease, as held by the ""revulsionists,"" or at a point nearer and on the same side of the body, as practised by the ""derivationists.""","They were supposed by him to be percipient, self-acting beings, not under arbitrary control of the deity, and yet God himself was the original monad from which all the rest are generated.","Some little consolation was found in the thought that in case all the baser metals were converted into gold iron would then become the ""precious metal,"" and would remain so until some new philosopher's stone was found to convert gold back into iron--a much more difficult feat, it was thought.",The improved method of generating electricity that had come into general use made several of the scientists again turn their attention more particularly to attempt putting it to some practical account.,"He also ascertained that air existed in a state of mechanical mixture with liquids, ""existing between their particles in a state of condensation.""","Taking his cue from this, he examined the lung of a turtle, and was able to see in it the passage of the corpuscles through these minute vessels, making their way along these previously unknown channels from the arteries into the veins on their journey back to the heart.","It is not necessary to go into details as to the cosmological system which Copernicus advocated, since it is familiar to every one.",ROGER BACON Bacon was born in 1214 and died in 1292.,"""Having three small, round glass bubbles, blown at the flame of a lamp, about the size of hazel-nuts,"" he says, ""each of them with a short, slender stem, by means whereof they were so exactly poised in water that a very small change of weight would make them either emerge or sink; at a time when the atmosphere was of convenient weight, I put them into a wide-mouthed glass of common water, and leaving them in a quiet place, where they were frequently in my eye, I observed that sometimes they would be at the top of the water, and remain there for several days, or perhaps weeks, together, and sometimes fall to the bottom, and after having continued there for some time rise again.","At one time he even went so far as to declare that, once he was ""free of this business,"" he would renounce scientific research forever, at least in a public way.","Probably they did, each according to his own mental bias; but, if so, they seldom committed themselves to writing, confining their discourses largely to speculations as to the properties of this illusive substance.",The elaborate experiments of Galileo regarding the former subject were made by measuring the velocity of a ball rolling down a plane inclined at various angles.,"One of the most important of these was the Lyncean Society, founded about the year 1611, Galileo himself being a member."
