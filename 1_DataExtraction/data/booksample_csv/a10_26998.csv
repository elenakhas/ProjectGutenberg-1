and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so long.",and he gasped and then nodded.,And when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept.,"The high-born fairies obtain this admired effect by pricking their skin, which lets the blue blood come through and dye them, and you cannot imagine anything so dazzling unless you have seen the ladies' busts in the jewellers' windows.","'I believe no one could teach that to you,' she answered adoringly, but Peter thought she meant that he was stupid.",Perhaps you wonder why he did not swim across.,"They then said, 'Well-a-day,' and 'Such is life,' for they can be frightfully sarcastic; but she felt sorry for those of them who had no crutches, and she said good-naturedly, 'Before I go to the fairies' ball, I should like to take you for a walk one at a time; you can lean on me, you know.'","Maimie could also see the pompous doctor feeling the Duke's heart and hear him give utterance to his parrot cry, and she was particularly sorry for the Cupids, who stood in their fools' caps in obscure places and, every time they heard that 'Cold, quite cold,' bowed their disgraced little heads.","At this the thrushes began to fidget, which made Peter tremble for his scheme.","How nice that would be to him, but oh!","Having escaped the danger of which, he was mercifully carried into a small bay, where his boat rode at peace.","They were wheeling a hand-cart with the flowers in it, and were quite surprised to find the bed occupied.","Poor Peter uttered a little moan at this, and he cried for the first time for I know not how long.","Well, Peter Pan got out by the window, which had no bars.","'Never, never!'",For weeks afterwards you can see the ring on the grass.,"'The window I flew out at will be open,' Peter said confidently.","But if it was the same one, it was Peter Pan's light.","Most gladsome sight of all, the Cupids plucked the hated fools' caps from their heads and cast them high in the air.",'O mother!',You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball.,"When they came up to whip Maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquilly--not shamming, you know, but really sleeping, and looking like the sweetest little angel, which seems to me to make it almost worse.",You must not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back.,"Peter also felt strangely uncomfortable, as if his head was stuffy; he heard loud noises that made him look round sharply, though they were really himself sneezing.",I shall tell you presently how he got his paddle.,I have promised to tell you also about his paddle.,"Most of them really are flowers, but some of them are fairies.","'If I chose to go back to mother,' he asked at last, 'could you give me that wish?'","They have a postman, but he never calls except at Christmas with his little box, and though they have beautiful schools, nothing is taught in them; the youngest child being chief person is always elected mistress, and when she has called the roll, they all go out for a walk and never come back.","But the kite broke to pieces in the air, and he would have been drowned in the Serpentine had he not caught hold of two indignant swans and made them carry him to the island.",P.' is written on the corner of the invitation-cards sent out by all really good families.,"She thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket, and tried to pull it over her head.","The windows were the size of a coloured picture-book and the door rather smaller, but it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof.","'Maimie,' he said, 'will you marry me?'","replied the oak bitingly, 'how deliciously cosy it is to stand here buttoned to the neck and watch you poor naked creatures shivering.'","'You are twenty thousand times braver than Tony,' she said; 'you are ever so much the bravest boy I ever knew.'",You know the boards which tell at what time the Gardens are to close to-day.,that she had to come out and show herself.,"But Solomon was right--there is no second chance, not for most of us.","'And if you want very much to give me a kiss,' Maimie said, 'you can do it.'","The fairies are exquisite dancers, and that is why one of the first things the baby does is to sign to you to dance to him and then to cry when you do it.",'Why don't you go?',"'What's this,' he cried, and first he shook the heart like a watch, and then he put his ear to it.","'Thank you,' she replied, 'I was so cosy and warm.","It was under a lime-tree, near the entrance to the Fairy Queen's Winter Palace (which is within the circle of the seven Spanish chestnuts), and Peter approached it warily, for the birds had never mentioned such things to him.",Peter now gave him a pound.,He was a poet; and they are never exactly grown-up.,"Then all the thrushes hopped for joy, and that very day was begun the celebrated Building of the Boat.",But there is also a way of finding out about the ball before it takes place.,"She stepped out by the roof, right over the garden, and then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the night.","You never can be sure of them, but a good plan is to walk by looking the other way, and then turn round sharply.","He could scarcely believe she meant it, but when he did believe he screamed with joy.","If you think he was the only baby who ever wanted to escape, it shows how completely you have forgotten your own young days.","'You will be a Betwixt-and-Between,' Solomon said, and certainly he was a wise old fellow, for that is exactly how it turned out.","Lest it was alive, he addressed it politely; and then, as it gave no answer, he went nearer and felt it cautiously.","He cannot with dignity retreat, but he stops and looks about him as if lost in admiration of the scenery, and presently he strolls away with a fine indifference and a glint at me from the corner of his eye.","Perhaps a human voice frightened the little house, or maybe it now knew that its work was done, for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began to grow smaller; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking, yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now.",The crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees and shrubs.,how exquisitely delicious it would be to her.,"She was disappointed not to see Peter Pan, and I may as well tell you now why he was so late that night.",They traced Maimie easily by her footprints in the snow.,That was the beginning of fairies.,This enables them to get begun half an hour earlier.,"It is because Peter wearies for summer and plays that it has come, and the chestnut being so near, hears him and is cheated.","When the first baby laughed for the first time, his laugh broke into a million pieces, and they all went skipping about.","This hoop always sank at once, but he waded in for it, and sometimes he dragged it gleefully round the rim of the pond, and he was quite proud to think that he had discovered what boys do with hoops.","When David heard this story first he was quite certain that he had never tried to escape, but I told him to think back hard, pressing his hands to his temples, and when he had done this hard, and even harder, he distinctly remembered a youthful desire to return to the tree-tops, and with that memory came others, as that he had lain in bed planning to escape as soon as his mother was asleep, and how she had once caught him half-way up the chimney.","But he smoked their design, and though on occasions he began, 'I wish----' he always stopped in time.",But Peter hesitated.,You will see presently why thrushes only were invited.,"He looked forward to retiring by and by, and devoting his green old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yew-stump in the Figs which had taken his fancy, and for years he had been quietly filling his stocking.","Maimie stamped her foot naughtily, and was putting her fingers to her eyes, when she heard a kind voice say, 'Don't cry, pretty human, don't cry,' and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy regarding her wistfully.",What a glorious boy he had meant to be to her!,"There are also numbers of them along the Baby Walk, which is a famous gentle place, as spots frequented by fairies are called.","But, first, he had to tell the birds of the value of Shelley's boat; and though they were too honest to demand it back, he saw that they were galled, and they cast such black looks at Solomon, who was rather vain of his cleverness, that he flew away to the end of the island, and sat there very depressed with his head buried in his wings.","At last, with a grand design burning within his brave heart, he begged them to do it once more with him clinging to the tail, and now a hundred flew off with the string, and Peter clung to the tail, meaning to drop off when he was over the Gardens."
