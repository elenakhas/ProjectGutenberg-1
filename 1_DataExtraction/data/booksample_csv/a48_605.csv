I did not know for certain that Dian was there; but I surmised as much.,"But Hooja had drawn closer in toward shore than we, so it looked as if he might head us off before we could land.","I took a step toward her, my arms outstretched.","""I have told you that before, but you would not believe me.",I was alone.,For that there was cause for great rejoicing.,Gr-gr-gr was standing beside me when the last of the cave men disappeared in rapid flight down the valley.,She was useless.,It was he whom we sought; but at its foot no river wound down toward any sea.,"One after another, following closely upon one another's heels, came fifty of the trim, graceful vessels.",Could I but have had my lost express-gun in my hands at that moment!,"We made our way steadily down the rim of the beautiful river which flows the length of the island, coming at last to a wood rather denser than any that I had before encountered in this country.","""They tell us that we are upon the right trail and not wandering far in the wrong direction.",He was coming down for breakfast.,It was well for me that this was true.,"The hot rays of the noonday sun did a great deal toward raising my spirits, and dispelling the mental gloom in which I had been shrouded almost continually since entering the Land of Awful Shadow.","Were there far-distant lands of which none of my people had ever heard, where a race had so greatly outstripped all other races of this inner world?",My masters did not seem to realize my perfidy.,At last there were but ten boatloads left.,He never would get anywhere without a balance-wheel--without some one to direct his energies.,Toward this I made my way.,For the life of me I couldn't see how both of us could escape.,"But we had no intention of sitting idle while our fate overtook us, so we bent to our paddles and, keeping parallel with the coast, did our best to pull away from our pursuers.","I questioned Juag upon the feasibility of attempting to cross to the mouth of the great river of which he had told me, and up which he said we might paddle almost to Sari; but he urged me not to attempt it, since we had but a single paddle and no water or food.","But let a tiger gaze fixedly at you from ambush, and unless your primitive instincts are completely calloused you will presently commence to glance furtively about and be filled with vague, unreasoning terror.",CHAPTER VII FROM PLIGHT TO PLIGHT I have never been much of a runner; I hate running.,"""Go back now to your people,"" I counseled them, ""and tell them that you have seen David I, Emperor of the Federated Kingdoms of Pellucidar, and that single-handed he has overcome you, just as he intends overcoming the Mahars and the Sagoths and any other peoples of Pellucidar who threaten the peace and welfare of his empire.""","It was still a long way off, and we couldn't make out whether it was island or mainland; but at least it was land.",He was having a most exciting time.,"""At least he can direct us upon the right direction toward Sari.""",A feeling of loneliness overwhelmed me.,"""Recently has another reason come.","I could see its mountains and valleys, oceans, lakes, and rivers, its broad, grassy plains and dense forests.","They may be a people of whom we have never even heard, and if so we can ask them to help us--if they know the way to the mainland.""","Again I tried to dissuade him, but he was simply crazy over the psychological effect which the appearance of this strange and mighty craft would have upon the natives of Pellucidar.","We had stuck the ends of some of the saplings into the ground in the building of our shelter, first stripping the leaves and branches from them, and when we awoke we found that many of them had thrust forth sprouts.",Nor were these all.,"""Set me free,"" I replied quickly.",He would fiddle around manufacturing gun-powder and trying to improve upon it until some one blew him up with his own invention.,"""You told me of great canoes which moved across the water without paddles, and which spat death from holes in their sides.","We planned much, rebuilding all our shattered air-castles; but above all we planned most to find Dian.",She was half-way down the cliff and progressing finely.,"He had to smile at that; but in extenuation of his act he assured me that it was quite customary for prime ministers to give their personal attention to the building of imperial navies; ""and this,"" he said, ""is the imperial navy of his Serene Highness, David I, Emperor of the Federated Kingdoms of Pellucidar.""","The location of Anoroc, the Mountains of the Clouds, the river, and the strip of seacoast were all familiar to him.",It was a critical moment.,"""Presently a little hole appeared in the wall at the point from which the voice had come.",With the impact with the water the hyaenodon released his hold upon my shoulder.,"There would his body be preserved in its icy sepulcher for countless ages, until on some far distant day the slow-moving river of ice had wound its snail-like way down to the warmer level, there to disgorge its grisly evidence of grim tragedy, and what in that far future age, might mean baffling mystery.",One of the nooses dropped to my ankles and was jerked up with a suddenness that brought me to my face upon the ground.,"""He has stolen my mate and I have come here to take her away from him and punish Hooja.""","With the secret of artificial propagation once more in their hands their numbers would soon be made so to overrun the world of Pellucidar that there could be no hope for the eventual supremacy of the human race, the cause for which I so devoutly hoped, for which I had consecrated my life, and for which I was not willing to give my life.","In that case my end would be no more certain, though infinitely more horrible and painful, for in the pits I should be subjected to cruel vivisection.","But as the Thurian came Raja loosened his hold upon the lidi and dashed for him, with the female close after.",I was surprised to discover that gratitude was a characteristic of the dominant race of Pellucidar.,"We know nothing of such things.""","When finally the female ceased to struggle and rolled over on her back, her forepaws limply folded, I was sure that she was dead.",Juag was still running in plain sight ahead of the bull.,There seemed but one thing to do; that was to keep on sailing straight before the wind--since we could travel most rapidly along that course--until we sighted land of some description.,They buried their talons in his back and lifted him bodily from the arena as if he had been a chicken in the clutches of a hawk.,"There is a certain unwritten law of the arena that vouchsafes freedom and immunity to the victor, be he beast or human being--both of whom, by the way, are all the same to the Mahar.","But the felucca pursued them relentlessly, her crew firing at will.",As Raja came close I caught him by the neck and pulled him up to me.,"And so we walked on together toward Thuria--I talking to the beast at my side, and he seeming to enjoy my company no less than I enjoyed his.","We are going back to look for it now.""",When he was opposite me I sprang for the heavy mane that covered his huge neck.,The going was easy by comparison with the awful obstacles we had had to encounter upon the opposite side of the divide.,he asked.,"The ""firing-line"" of the brute-men wielded no weapon other than their long fiber nooses.",Yet I think that we gave a good account of ourselves in our final effort to escape.,"Before we halted to eat or rest, we stood beside a little mountain brook beneath the wondrous trees of the primeval forest in an atmosphere of warmth and comfort.","""What could the men of Pellucidar do without you to lead them?","But eventually she tolerated Juag as she had Dian and me, and the five of us set out toward the coast, for Juag had just completed his labors on the thag when we arrived.",There I saw the huge imprints of a lidi's feet.,Thus was it with me then.,"How can he reward you?""",We might even use them later ourselves in this same capacity.,"""Why did you kill them?""",I laid my hand upon his head.,They were marching across our front.,"What are you, and what strange thing is that which flutters from the little tree in the front of your canoe?""","It was a nasty place to land, and I realized now why it was not used by the natives; but at last I managed, after a good wetting, to beach my canoe and scale the cliffs.",When I glanced over my shoulder I could see that the archers had already fitted arrows to their bows in readiness to fire upon us the moment that they should draw within range.,"With it came I, David, Emperor of Pellucidar."
