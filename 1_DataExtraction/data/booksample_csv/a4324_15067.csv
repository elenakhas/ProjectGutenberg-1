"Ah, here alone can one feel near Her, and see Her!","He had, in fact, retraced his steps, and lay half paralyzed, no longer even in the vestibule of his mansion, but in the outer court.","If we sum up the whole impression produced by this work, we are led to the conclusion that mystical art, still dwelling on earth, and not restricted to scenes in Heaven, as Angelico had chosen to limit it in his ""Coronation of the Virgin,"" has produced in Roger van der Weyden's triptych the purest effluence of prayer to be found in painting.","And what, after all, were these trifles, these minor details in the splendid completeness of the cloister?",That town was the second stage of Her progress through France in the nineteenth century.,This diversion made him glad; he thought that this task might perhaps preserve him from vain thoughts of his discomfiture at Chartres and his fancy for the cloister.,"Be this as it may, he, with the eye of a visionary, with his serious but fervid art, his genius for concentration, for getting a spot of the essence of sunlight into the heart of darkness, has accomplished great results; and in his Biblical scenes has spoken a language which no one before him had even attempted to lisp.","Yes, indeed, he is quite right--our friend is right,"" she went on, addressing the priests, who laughed.","Tradition gives this statue the name of St. Jude, and this resemblance is suggestive between the saint whom Christians most neglected, and who for several centuries found so few devotees that suddenly, one day, on the theory that he, less than the others, would have exhausted his credit with God, people took to imploring him for desperate cases, lost souls, and the poet so utterly ignored or so stupidly condemned by the very Catholics to whom he has given the only mystical verses produced since the Middle Ages.","""For instance, Saint Epiphanius describes her as tall, with olive eyes arched and very black eyebrows, an aquiline nose a rosy mouth, and a golden-toned skin.",This indeed was the idea put into words by the Synod of Arras in 1025: 'That which the illiterate cannot apprehend from writing shall be shown to them in pictures.',asked the Abbe Plomb.,"""But all this is evidently familiar to you.","The establishment of the Church in the place of the Synagogue is foretold by Ezekiel, Isaiah, Joel, and Micah; and the Mass, the Eucharistic Sacrament, is plainly adumbrated by Malachi, who declared that for the offerings of the Old Law offered only in the Temple at Jerusalem shall be substituted 'a pure offering to be offered in every place and by all nations'--by priests chosen from among all people, Isaiah adds, and David says after the order of Melchizedec.","I will now tell you of a singular instance of a church which, instead of reproducing the attitude of the Divine Corpse, represents that of His still living Body, a church which seems to have a suggestion of movement as if bending like Christ on the Cross.","At Bourges, for instance, analogous prophets and very similar queens stand meditative in, one of the extraordinary side bays where the Arab trefoil is so conspicuous.","From the little I have been told by my two priests, the blessed silence of the Cistercians is not the rule with the black-frocked Orders.","He had, to be sure, only thought of it definitely in the form of impossible longings and regrets, for he knew full well that neither was his body strong enough nor his soul staunch enough for him to bury himself as a Trappist.","""Moreover, if we admit that the sculptors of the thirteenth century introduced the acanthus on account of its emollient qualities, the oak because it is emblematic of strength, and the water-lily because its broad leaves are accepted as a figure of charity, we ought no less to conclude that at the end of the fifteenth century, when the mystery of symbolism was not as yet altogether lost, the toothed bunches of curled cabbage, of thistles and other deeply-cut leaves mingling with true-love-knots, as in the church at Brou, might have had some meaning.",There he could laugh and not be ashamed.,"The weather was gloomy, and yet a furnace of gems flamed in the lancets of the windows and the blazing wheels of the roses.","""Very true,"" replied the Abbé Plomb.","""This school may be thus summed up,"" said Durtal.","""If you like!""","There were doubts as to her being admitted to the Order, and again Saint Theresa intervened and commanded the Abbess to receive her.","""Well, well; but she is a good woman!""",It was like being in the tomb.,"He is a Sister rather than a Friar-artist; and it is from this loving sensibility, which in the mystic vocation is more generally peculiar to women, that he has drawn the pathetic orisons and tender lamentation of his works.","He could not find him in his own house, nor in the cathedral; but at last, directed by the beadle, he made his way to the house at the corner of the Rue de l'Acacia, where the choir-school was lodged.","""Dryness of spirit and the dreams to which it gives rise are not the sign of a vocation,"" said he.",But the Virgin!,The Abbe rose and went to the window.,"He had his divan there, his pictures, the old furniture he had brought from Paris; and against the walls, shelves, painted black, held thousands of books.",What was most odd was the various shapes of their coifs.,"Durtal, kneeling before Her, determined to address Her, to say to Her,-- ""I am afraid of the future and of its cloudy sky, and I am afraid of myself, for I am wasting in depression and bewilderment.","Merely looking at a sleeping vice is enough to wake it.""","""For pride we have the pumpkin, which was worshipped of old as a divinity in Sicyon.","""The avatar of some other Scriptural personages might be equally well carried out by these emblematical minerals,"" observed the Abbe Gevresin.","Thus, on the whole, the types used by Angelico are not less restricted than his colours.","And at last, when he felt himself bruised by these alternating desires and fears, he took refuge with Notre Dame de Sous-Terre.","Their attempt, however, had begotten no following, and at this day the school is almost dead, producing nothing but feeble prints for old women designed by the lay-brothers.","""To her he was a sort of priestly angel charged with the preparation for the great Act of Redemption.""","""As to blue stones, we must not forget that St. Mechtildis regarded the sapphire as the very heart of the Virgin,"" observed the Abbe Plomb.","The sort of requisition he had laid before the Abbé Gévresin, to put an end to his tossing and decide for him one way or the other, was distracting while it terrified him.","""This archaeologist's ideas, in fact, cannot be maintained.","""I will not contradict you,"" said the Abbé Plomb.",Among the religious youth of to-day no one is to be found equal to the presentment of Church subjects.,"""And the saint added, 'God, who deprived him of them, would not that the stones should lose their virtues; He desired, on the contrary, that they should ever be held in honour, and used in medicine to the end that sickness should be cured and ills driven out.'","It was difficult to see, and Durtal had begun to think that he should never succeed in getting past the dim mass of the wall that shut in the square, by pushing open the door behind which lay that weird forest, redolent of the night-lamp and the tomb, and protected from the gale.","""This Carmelite convent you see is a very austere house,"" said she, ""and as you may suppose, grace abounds;"" and when Durtal murmured,-- ""What a contrast between this dead spot and the railway that runs past it, always in a stir!""","We can take shelter in the church, and study the interior at our leisure.""","The Synoptical Gospels number him among the Apostles, but Saint John omits him, and mentions in his place one Nathanael, of whom the other three Evangelists do not speak.","Yes, if we admit the law of antagonism, the rules of inversion, and if we know that symbolism authorizes the system of contraries, allowing the use of the hues which are appropriated to certain virtues to indicate the vices opposed to them.""","""What I should now like to know,"" he went on, ""is why the historians of this cathedral pronounce the scene of the last Judgment represented on the tympanum of the door as the most remarkable of its kind in France.","""At Solesmes; but he comes home the day after to-morrow.","The she-goat is sometimes held in ill-fame as being akin to the he-goat, but it more often is regarded as the Well-Beloved, to which the Bride in Canticles compares it.",What was most odd was the various shapes of their coifs.,"Add to that his inability to keep a carriage, so that he has to hire a conveyance for his pastoral rounds.","Flesh sputtered on the walls, mingling the black stench of burnt fat with the blue vapour of incense; the Patriarch anointed the right ear and thumb and foot of Aaron and his sons with blood; then, taking up the flesh of the sacrifice, he placed them in the hands of the new-made priests, who rocked first on one foot and then on the other, thus waving the offerings above the altar.","Only, in the present day, such memories of heroic times were vain.","""He is scarcely mentioned in the Gospels, but they point out that he is not to be confounded with Judas--which, however, was done, actually by reason of the similarity of name, during the Middle Ages; Christians rejected him and sorcerers appealed to him.","The Virgin so guilelessly charming, so exquisitely chaste, holding out the Infant to Simeon, who stands mild and devout in his solemn garb as High Priest.","The first on the right is the mantle of St. Cecilia; others are the bodice of St. Agnes, St. Stephen's robe, a prophet's tunic; and above these, before reaching the lapis-lazuli border of sky, the robe of the first angel.","I knew when I went there that I should not stay; it was a painful time to be endured, but it was only a short time; whereas at this moment I have to come to a determination from which there is no turning back, to go to a place where, if I once shut myself in, I must stay till I die.",Why was this?,"It struck Durtal that the woes repressed in the morning hours were poured out in the twilight; the faithful did not now come for Her alone, but for themselves; each one brought a load of sorrows and opened it before Her.","""And yet the Lord certainly commanded her to found this Order of the Incarnate Word.","In fact, his baleful effluvia are of two kinds: one characterized by the stench of sulphurous waters and drains; the other by a false odour of sanctity, delicious gusts of sweetness and temptation.","at the feet of Notre Dame de Sous-Terre; by the grace of heaven, the remaining frescoes seemed extinct; at any rate, they lay in shadow.","""Very true; these various meanings of persons and objects, resulting from numerical differences, are at first very puzzling.""","""Nor is that all,"" he went on.","Four typifies the cardinal virtues, the four Greater Prophets, the Gospels and the elements.","This Way of the Cross was matchless from this point of view: Monastic piety had introduced an unexpected element, giving evidence of the mysterious power it has at its command, infusing a personal emotion, a peculiar aroma, into a work which, without it, would never indeed have existed.","""Symbols, then, have a divine origin; it may be added that from the human point of view this form of teaching answers to one of the least disputable cravings of the human mind.","And seeing that Durtal was listening to him with interest, the Abbe came back to his seat, and said,-- ""What is a symbol?","she was always gay, and preached cheerfulness to her daughters in these words: ""It is all very well for those who sin to be sad; but we ought to have twice as much joy as the angels, since we, like them, fulfil the will of God, and we, in addition, can suffer for His glory, which they can never do.""","""Well, then, what is there to hinder you?","""It has been served with every sauce!","""And the sacristy?""",exclaimed Durtal.,"""Then is there nothing, absolutely nothing, to the credit side for the Church?""","""And yet more of the soul's peace,"" replied the Abbé.",he would ask himself.
