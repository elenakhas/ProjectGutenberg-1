"He was sick and dizzy, and blood oozed from his nose.","A cloud of smoke hid everything, but a naked, blood-stained devil caught me by the throat and drove his knife into my breast.","He had not slain his foe, because he wished to hold the threat of his losing over the heads of his own rebellious subjects.",Octavia changed color and listened with intensified interest as the counsellor nodded toward her.,"'That won't be much, but it'll give you a chance to get past him down the stair.","Something whirred above her head and she cowered, even though realizing it was only a bat.","As he climbed the cliff, one of these men breathed deeply and stealthily lifted a bow.",The people--the dark-skinned people--one of them caught me in the forest and brought me here.,"While carnage and slaughter bellowed through the red smoke that choked the streets, the grimmest act of that grim drama was played in the cryptic dome behind the great daised chamber with its copper throne and its walls mottled like the skin of serpents.",Kill me with your sword before he bursts the door!',"'It is more through wild animal instinct than through intelligence,' answered Ghaznavi.",'Oh Mitra!,"And as he did so, his heart nearly stopped.",'I will not!',A low cry escaped her as the door shook and a bolt gave way with a groan.,Through the tangled branches not even a star peered.,She stood with hanging head before her master until he motioned her to a seat on the divan beside him.,"There was no one to be seen, but beyond the western wall there sounded cries and moaning wails that made Octavia tremble.",'But how?',It does not matter.,"Conan cleared the space between him and the throne with a desperate bound, his scimitar swinging with all his power.","'But that can not be,' she murmured, 'because I am alive, and I thought I was dead.",Lifting his bow he drew the shaft to its head and loosed.,"Make for that door at the other end of the hall, because I'll be past helping you.","Strange that a devil has to break down a door like a common man; but after all, his strength itself is a diabolism.'",I don't care.,"The hinges had given under the giant's terrible assault and the door rocked crazily, held only by the bolts.","No less disturbed, he hastily laid her on the furs upon the dais.",He told me--he said--am I mad?,Have you cut the heads off many Yuetshi?',"'But they are very terrible,' she murmured.",Let us live while we can.,"Then presently there was silence, but there was a new _feel_ in the air.",They had waited for no more.,"'No,' he said, 'it's no dream.","Conan jerked the supine body out of the panel-entrance and stepped through, pulling the panel shut after him.",This snake was evidently meant to represent one of those grim monsters of the marsh which in past ages had haunted the reedy edges of Vilayet's southern shores.,"He went silently in his soft leather boots, his gaze sifting every shadow in eagerness to catch sight of the splendid tawny-haired beauty of whom he had dreamed ever since he had seen her in the pavilion of Jehungir Agha by Fort Ghori.","I had rather catch him descending the stair, where we can feather him with arrows from a safe distance.'","Sword shaking in his grasp, horror and revulsion and fear almost choking him, he backed away and down the glass steps with painful care, glaring in awful fascination at the grisly thing that slumbered on the copper throne.","She seemed to partake of the illusion that haunted this whole city, but the firm resilience of her limbs under his questing fingers convinced him that he had a living human girl in his arms, and not the shadow of a dream.","She did not like the look of those ebony shadows, but she set her teeth and went toward them, trying not to think of snakes.","He stood silently facing the dark towers that loomed through the trees, his eyes slits of blue bale-fire.",She had come upon what seemed to be steps carved in the cliff.,"'If we could trap Conan on that island, alone, we could hunt him down at our leisure, with bows, as men hunt a lion.'",Love me!',"'On the contrary,' rejoined Jehungir with studied cruelty, 'you will.","His face lost something of its human aspect, a nimbus of fire played about his awesome head, and like a moving tower he came on.","It was not a clever copy, but the skin of an actual beast.",replied Jehungir feelingly.,But folk who have tasted death are only partly alive.,"Once among them, the darkness closed frighteningly about her.","But she merely smothered a yawn with a dainty hand, rose from the alcove and leaned negligently against the hanging which she held with one hand.",She shook her head as if to clear it.,"'Nor was there light, nor motion, nor any sound.",3 In the darkness before dawn an unaccustomed sound disturbed the solitude that slumbered over the reedy marshes and the misty waters of the coast.,"Conan admired the scaly torso, thick as his thigh and obviously of great length, and he reached out and laid a curious hand on the thing.","The circumference of the wall was not great, but the number of green stone buildings it contained was surprizing.",From that dome the Yuetshi priest emerged alone.,"As he approached he saw that the walls were composed of the same green stone that had formed the ruins, and he was haunted by a vague sense of familiarity.",he snapped.,If you can get out of the palace you may escape him yet.,"'You will not die, my rebellious beauty,' said Jehungir, 'but you will be subjected to a very painful and humiliating experience.'",'Don't stop to talk!','The magic Yuetshi blade!,She scrambled up over the cliff edge and looked timidly at the dense shadows which confronted her.,It pleased him to restore the city as it was in the days before its fall.,"4 As the first tinge of dawn reddened the sea, a small boat with a solitary occupant approached the cliffs.","Each scale stood out as distinctly as in real life, and the iridescent colors were vividly reproduced.","But the valves yielded to his touch, and he glided through and closed them behind him.",The eyes were balls of dark fire.,"Through the belling of the voice which was like a tolling of triumph over the ordered laws of a sane planet, a human sound anchored Conan's mind from its flight through spheres of madness.",But after many ages a fierce and brutish people appeared on the shores of the sea.,It did not move.,"She idly inspected her smooth bosom, and then sank upon Conan's lap and passed her supple arms around his massive neck.","By his necromancy he lifted the towers from the dust of forgotten millenniums, and the folk which had been dust for ages moved in life again.","His burning gaze had frightened and humiliated her, but his cleanly elemental fierceness set him above Jelal Khan, a monster such as only an overly opulent civilization can produce.",Conan shut it and dropped in place the great bars with which it was furnished.,"In the stillness Conan heard other noises on the landing outside--the beat of wings, and a muttering voice that was like the whining of wind through midnight branches.",She knew that most of the islands off that marshy coast were uninhabited.,"An instant he reeled on wide-braced legs, feeling his ribs caving in on his vitals and his sight growing dark, while his scimitar gleamed above his head.",You are no dream.,'You are not a Dagonian.
