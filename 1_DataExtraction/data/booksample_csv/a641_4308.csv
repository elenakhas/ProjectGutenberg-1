their start promised an enjoyable day.,"And you always come just this way 'cause it's nice and convenient for Lambeth Road, ain't it?","""You reserve to yourself; I presume, the duty of acquainting her with these painful facts?""","""Aunt Louisa's been making a bother, has she?",Best is near a Board School when the children are about.,"she exclaimed at length in profound agitation, ""that explains so many things!","That's what I like about you; you always look respectable.""","Oh, yes, of course.","And I don't know you either after to-night, so just remember that, Mr. Parish.","""You've nowhere to sleep--ain't that it?""","""What do you mean by it, Mrs. Bubb?",asked his hostess.,"""We will say nothing to her yet, if you please.","He added a brief account of what had happened between Polly and her uncle, Greenacre listening as if this threw new light on the case.","""Quodlings' traveller.","He had set his mind on discovering Mrs. Clover's husband, and was all the more determined to perform this feat since the recent events in Kennington Road.","""I hoped you were going to walk,"" urged Christopher timidly.",Now he would not visit her; he would not write.,The girl laughed loudly as if at a preposterous question.,"When he went forth into the cold street never was man more softly amorous, more mirthfully exultant, more kindly disposed to all the dwellers upon earth.","Polly grew hot with anger, then subsided into mortification.",So saying he took his leave with bows and flourishes.,Flecks of dim white had for some minutes been visible above their heads; it was beginning to snow.,"You're a man of business, are you not?","""Oh, I've a good memory for faces.","""Well, Mr. Gammon, I do think--"" But the landlady's protest was cut short by a loud slamming of the house-door.","""Nonsense!",It returned upon both with the freshness of surprise; even Polly had quite lost sight of the startling fact during the last few minutes.,"""Now then, give an account of yourself.""","Both of them, it seemed, bore a likeness to some profligate aristocrat.","With a marked display of interesting embarrassment Miss Waghorn introduced him to her companion, Mr. Nibby, who showed himself cordial.",He could not determine whether he had given her up or not; he did not know whether to bow before Mrs. Clover or to protest and persevere.,"At a second meeting with the venerable bagman--who had a wonderful head for whisky--Gammon acquired so much technical information that oil and colours might fairly be set down among his numerous ""specialities.""","you nasty, ungrateful young woman, you!""",Of all the shimeless creatures!,"A few days after this Minnie's mother, overcoming a secret scruple and yielding to a long desire, allowed herself to write a letter to Mr. Gammon.","I've had a present given to me; well, what of that?","But this was the last day save one of Polly's week, and as yet she had given no sign.","Why, I've as good as forgot there was such a man!","Instantly a man sprang forward to her defence, and he, too, planted his fist between the eyes of the hapless peer.","""Then Mrs. Clover--as we call her--wasn't really his wife at all?""","""All right, if you won't do it say so, and I'll ask somebody else.","What you've got to do, my angel, is to find where that lady lives--the one that sat next our friend, you know, not the foreigner.","replied the other, as cheerfully as he could.","On the walls hung three brightly-coloured calendars, each an advertisement: one of sewing machines, one of a popular insurance office, one of a local grocery business.",Polly was short with him.,It came so sudden.,"I'm so glad you happened to drop in.""","I'm sure it would be better, and I may be able to give you a reason before long.""",Gammon looked at his watch.,"Polly went down into the kitchen, where Mrs. Cheeseman, a stout woman of slatternly appearance, was sitting with her legs crossed and a plate of shrimps in her lap.",I am not welcome;
