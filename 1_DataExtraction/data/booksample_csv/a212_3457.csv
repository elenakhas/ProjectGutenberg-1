you the double-cross,"" cut in Bo Rayner's cool voice.","""He's done it!""","The time seemed long, but at last she got there.","Why, Nell and I couldn't even walk to the store in the village.","Helen did not need to see any more, but Dale silently pointed to a patch of blood.","Bo was all eyes while Dale slipped off the bridle from his horse and then with slow, plain action readjusted it.",Bo said he'd be killed.,“Who 're you goin' to prove it to--thet I'm dishonest?” “To my men--to your men--to the people of Pine--to everybody.,"CHAPTER XXI The girl refused to take food proffered her by Riggs,
