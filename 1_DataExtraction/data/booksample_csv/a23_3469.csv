I make a great mistake if she has for a moment thought of concealing that from him.',"Will you delay your answer till some time hence, when you have thoroughly considered; since I fear it may be a hasty one now?'","If I could    not get a pupil-teachership in some London school (and I believe I    could by advertising) I could stay with you, and be governess to    Georgina and Myrtle, for I am sure you cannot spare time enough to    teach them as they ought to be taught, and Emmeline is not old enough    to have any command over them.","'Though he is your brother, sir, I must say this, that I would rather she married the poorest man I know.'",At about the midnight hour she felt more fortified on the expediency of marriage with Lord Mountclere than she had done at all since musing on it.,One wintry afternoon he reached the door--now for the third time--and gave a knock which had in it every tender refinement that could be thrown into the somewhat antagonistic vehicle of noise.,"I have been trying at Knollsea for a fortnight, and it is no use.",'No; quite the reverse.,"You see, my dear Berta,    marriage is a thing which, once carried out, fixes you more firm in a    position than any personal brains can do; for as you stand at present,    every loose tooth, and every combed-out hair, and every new wrinkle,    and every sleepless night, is so much took away from your chance for    the future, depending as it do upon your skill in charming.","'Now, how do you think this bonnet will do?","Ethelberta did everything for her, in short; and Picotee obeyed orders with the abstracted ease of mind which people show who have their thinking done for them, and put out their troubles as they do their washing.","'O no, no: there is nothing like that.",I think they would all like to speak to you.','Confound the clothes!,I hardly can myself.',said Ethelberta.,"'I thought I would call on her this afternoon, but when I got there I found she had left early for the performance.",The result of this change was soon perceptible.,"What was honest in Enckworth Court was that portion of the original edifice which still remained, now degraded to subservient uses.","This epistle was very courteously written, and in point of correctness, propriety, and gravity, might have come from the quill of a bishop.","Picotee opened the door, and said, with an anxiety transcending Ethelberta's, 'Well?'","a tear, and a song.","He watched Picotee and her brother off the premises, and the pair went on their way towards Exonbury Crescent, very few words passing between them.","'I wonder if she has deceived him in anything,' murmured Chickerel.",'Care for us both equally!',"said Picotee, just as bitterly.","'No, I too shall go to the church first, just to assure myself,' said Chickerel.",'Are you the parish clerk?',"Upon the glazed tiles within the chimney-piece were the forms of owls, bats, snakes, frogs, mice, spiders in their webs, moles, and other objects of aversion and darkness, shaped in black and burnt in after the approved fashion.","Well, 'tis a fine place.",I wish Picotee and yourself could see us oftener; I am as confirmed a bachelor now as Faith is an old maid.,"'If it were true,' added Ethelberta, smiling.",Chickerel mused on the circumstance as he took his ticket and got into the train.,"'Thank you,' said Sol.","They parted and took their respective places, Lord Mountclere choosing a compartment next to the one Ethelberta was entering, and not, as she had expected, attempting to join her.","'Ah, yes; thank you,' said Christopher.",he murmured.,"'Yes,' said Mr. Doncastle, in a low tone.",Menlove!,"'I suppose they will be off somewhere, and she is busy getting ready?'",Autumn had begun to make itself felt and seen in bolder and less subtle ways than at first.,"When we have put Joey into buttons, he will do very well to attend to the door.'","You know what lady's face served as the original to this, I suppose?'",'But see what she implied to me!,.,'O no--I think you will be mine now.',"Ethelberta and Lord Mountclere looked that way: and behold, Picotee had nearly swooned.","'You are too warm about it, Kit--it cannot be so bad as that.","The question is, how long shall I be able to do it?'",Leave all to me.,"The shop-folk be out of stock, I hear, and the visiting lady up the hill is terribly in want of clothes, so 'tis said.","It contained these words only, in a scrawl so full of deformities that she could hardly piece its meaning together:--    'I must see you again to-day unless you absolutely deny yourself to    me, which I shall take as a refusal to meet me any more.",.,"The approach was like a turnpike road full of great ruts, clumsy mendings; bordered by trampled edges and incursions upon the grass at pleasure.",It became evident to all the family that some misunderstanding had arisen between Ethelberta and Mr. Julian.,"'Never mind it,' said Christopher, a sense of the true state of her case dawning upon him with unpleasant distinctness, and bringing some irritation at his awkward position; though it was impossible to be long angry with a girl who had not reasoning foresight enough to perceive that doubtful pleasure and certain pain must be the result of any meeting whilst hearts were at cross purposes in this way.",But their sister had other lines laid down for them than those of level progress; to start them some day as masters instead of men was a long-cherished wish of Ethelberta's.,"So, though I don't mean to be    harsh, I must impress upon you the necessity of going on as you are    going just at present.","The occasion, the place, and their own condition, made them kin.","said Neigh, noticing an abstraction in his companion.",Christopher had now a far better opportunity than before for observing Ethelberta's betrothed.,I don't like it.,But melancholy and mistaken thoughts of herself as a counterfeit had brought her to this.,'I do not--you did not blench.,"No sooner had Picotee left her sister's room, than Ethelberta thought it would after all have been much better if she had gone down herself to speak to this admirably persistent lover.","'No, Christopher: really you did not.",He bowed and walked out awkwardly.,"'It is,' said Cornelia.","He entered and sat down beside Mountclere, not without a sense that he was spoiling good upholstery; the coachman then allowed the lash of his whip to alight with the force of a small fly upon the horses, which set them up in an angry trot.","There, don't spoil your eyes: you may have to sell them.'","'And so she told him,' said Ladywell.",37.,I wish Captain Strong to bring the Fawn round into Knollsea Bay.,"Say, shall it be here, or where they are standing?'","Christopher parted from his companion and soon reached a stile, clambering over which he entered a park.",'What man was that?',"She spoke in a settled way, as if something intended had been set in train; and Christopher having promised for his sister, he went out of the house with a parting smile of misgiving.",'Lord Mountclere is to be married to Mrs. Petherwin quite privately.',When the hour drew nigh enormous force of will was required to keep her perturbation down.,"'Since the matter has been mentioned,' said Mr. Jones, 'I may say that I too noticed the singularity of it.'","'I'll tell somebody downstairs of you, who'll soon see about it!'","I don't like my relations being my servants; but if they did not work for me, they would have to work for others, and my service is much lighter and pleasanter than any other lady's would be for them, so the advantages are worth the risk.","Some disclosure or reference to me otherwise than as your mistress, will certainly be made else, and then I am ruined."
