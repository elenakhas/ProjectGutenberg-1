she was probably born here, and will be buried in a corner of the cemetery, by the side of her father.","""She loves another?","In a word, he belonged to that small class who live quietly, and who are worth more to the world than those who do not appreciate them.","All external sensations caused me insupportable fatigue, all well-known objects of daily life repelled and annoyed me;

and that which, fifteen days before, would have intoxicated me with love and happiness, repeated thus, filled me with horror.",And they have said that thy passing beams have illumined their fugitive life.,"A dilapidated open wagon, flaming torches lighting up painted faces; such laugh and sing.","I stopped in the hall; every note reached my ear distinctly; never had she sung so sadly, so divinely.","I waited a moment, in order to conceal my astonishment.","But tell me, is that the love of our women?","These are the signs which led to an unfavorable opinion of Mercanson, an opinion which was unfortunately correct.","Why has she closed her door against me, and why did she send you to tell me of it?""","Her daily life was recorded there; what she had lost, what she had hoped, the isolation she experienced even in my presence, the barrier that was growing up between us, the cruelties I subjected her to in return for her love and her resignation--all that was written down without a complaint;
