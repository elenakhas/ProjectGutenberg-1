"""O!""",For shame!,"Sir Jasper rose, drew a paper from his bosom, sighed, languished with his soulful eyes and read:   ""Groan, groan my heart, yet in thy groaning joy   Since thou'rt deep-smit of Venus' blooming boy;   Till Sorrow's flown   And Joy's thine own   Groan!""","""'Twas madness, Charles.""","""A Gad's name--why?""","Furthermore and moreover Mr. Dalroyd would be the last man I'd ha' you cross blades with on account o' the Captain's devilish sword-play--that thrust of his in carte nigh did your honour's business ten years ago, consequently to-day I hold my peace regarding suspicions o' same.""","I bowse no lage, but one whole gage     O' this I'll bowse to you----"" ""Stow the chaunting, Jerry!""","""Well, you've sung 'bout a bird, 'n' fish, 'n' beast--why ignore the humble reptile?","""It hath been done before, I think, sir!""","None the less I joy to see thee, George,"" said the Major, rising and extending his hand.","""'Tis the one I used for to carry when we were on outpost duty at night, sir--the one as I had shortened for the purpose, your honour.","'Twill never do----"" ""Sink me, Ben--why not?""",A blooming plum--round and ripe--aha!,"""I saw you also, madam.""","All the afternoon he kept the road, and as the day waned he became ever more alert, his quick eyes scanned the road before and behind and he rode for long stretches with his head leaned to that angle of patient listening for sounds afar.","But all at once she started from him as, afar off, a faint wailing arose: ""Betty, my love!","""Were?""","Hard by, Alvaston lay forward across the table, his face pillowed upon a plate, deep-plunged in stertorous slumber while the Colonel, sitting opposite, leaned back in his chair and stared up solemnly at the raftered ceiling.","The Major, scowling and disgusted thus to have stumbled upon a vulgar amour and fearing to be seen, waited impatiently for them to be gone.","""Sir,"" said Joseph, eyes lowered yet perfectly aware of his master's watchful scrutiny, ""everything is packed save your brushes and the gillyflower water.""","""Until to-morrow night--at the ruined mill, Zeb.""","What for?""","""Od, gentlemen,"" said he, lace handkerchief a-flutter, ""since you'd have it, I'll freely--hem!",Her air!,"""Charity Bent, sir.""",exclaimed Sir Benjamin in very apparent relief.,"The Major glanced from his disordered dress to the Sergeant's bloody face: ""Are you hurt, Zeb?""","she answered and clasping her arm about him set her cheek to his, and the Viscount, glancing from one face to the other, fell back in staring surprise.","""John,"" she murmured, ""you dear, noble, generous Jack--ah, don't you see?","I do love your respect and reverent homage, 'tis this doth make me yearn to be more worthy--but alack!","And why, Tom?""",'Tis then agreed--O 'twill be pure!,"""None, sir.""",said the Major.,"""Naughty lad!""","""But hope an' expect to observe same to-night towards the hour o' midnight or thereabouts and if so, shall immediately try what cold steel can do agin it.""","""Hum!""","Here, meeting his ardent gaze, she flushed and drooped her lashes, yet nestled closer.",he enquired.,said the Major.,"""I'm glad o' that, Zeb, very!""",But Betty was in London and London's the devil of a way from Carlisle.,"""Drunk as usual, Jerry?""",growled Mr. Marchdale.,"""Only now I must go!""","Inside, sheltered from rain and wind the Major unloosed his heavy coat and took from under his arm a certain knobby bludgeon and twirled it in the dark while Sergeant Zebedee, hard by, struck flint and steel, but the tinder was damp and refused to burn.","The Major bowed: ""May I pour you a glass of wine, Captain Effingham?","wailed the Lady Belinda, starting up from her cushions.","The rascal fences purely well, I vow.""",exclaimed the Major.,"""'Tis a true saying, Zeb,"" he sighed, ""a true saying and not to be controverted.""","""And my name is Betty and yours is John and we are neighbours.","They would naturally search there first and very thoroughly.""","And your jack-boots is buckle-shoes, and you're very much alive, ain't you, sir--so I'll ax you to pick up your property and to get back over the wall yonder and to do it--prompt, sir.""","""Stop!""","""And in danger, d'ye say?","""Thank'ee humbly, my Benjamin!""","Mr. Dalroyd took one, balanced it and cursed its weight and clumsiness.","""Nay, he's very secret.""",exclaimed the Colonel suddenly.,"You learn precisely when the soldiers march for Westerham and, if need be, you make your excuses and ride back to warn me of their coming.","""Ha--begad!",he enquired.,Where?,"exclaimed the Sergeant suddenly, ""clean through the gizzard, sir!""","""And now,"" she questioned, ""why do you tramp to and fro sleepless all night?","""The lane makes a bend there sir, and when I saw I stopped----"" ""So here's the true cause of your quarrel, Tom?""",said the Major.,"""You were wiser to avoid Sir Oliver Rington's neighbourhood, and here's somewhat to aid you on your way.""","the fount, the source, the mainspring of valour, is't not?","He was close upon the combatants when one staggered and fell, another was beaten to his knees and then the earl was upon them.","exclaimed the Sergeant, starting.","""No, no, my dear, no no!""","""Who, mam?""","""A free-lance in love, I--to woo precisely how and where and--when, I choose.""","""But I have seen it!""","""Yes,"" he answered, ""because of her memory I have lived a hard life and let love go by nor thought of it.""","For once in her twenty-two years of life my lady Betty felt herself at a disadvantage; twice she turned to speak but he, walking behind with head bowed, seemed utterly oblivious of her, wherefore she held her peace and threw up proud head disdainfully.",To-night you did look on me as I had committed--as I had been--O 'twas a hateful look!,"""Egad you're in the right on't--er--I fear my attention was wandering as 'twere--though I listen very well with my eyes shut!""","she commanded, speaking over her shoulder, ""I've heard enough, aye--enough for a lifetime!""",she enquired gravely.,"""'Twas a woman's notion,"" explained Sir Jasper, ""a whim, a fancy."
