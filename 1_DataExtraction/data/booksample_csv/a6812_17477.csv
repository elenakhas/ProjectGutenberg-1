That was all.,"""I'm testifyin' to that!""","Lawler crossed the big rotunda, where the light was subdued; and walked down a wide corridor, pausing before a door on which was the legend: ""State Railroad Commissioner.""","The people of this state are pretty well worked up, and are demanding legislation that will curb the power of the railroads--that will make impossible a situation such as existed under the regime of my predecessor.","she said, startled, when she saw Antrim's face in the glare of light from within; ""I thought you were one of the Circle L men!""",For I couldn't make you hear me.,Don't move a finger or bat an eyelash!,Then the scene changed swiftly.,"An' if we winter them on the open range there wouldn't be a sound hoof left by spring, for we've got no feed put by.","""Didn't I hit him right,"" he sneered.",He did not intend to be taken by surprise.,"Lawler walked to the table and sat beside it, placing the gun near his right hand.","He had placed no credence in the rumors, ascribing them to the imaginations of mischievous brains, prejudiced against Singleton because of his bluff, dominant manner.","""I--I thought that--perhaps--when you saw that I would testify against you--you would--"" She paused and tried to get closer to him, but he held her off and watched her keenly, suspiciously.","Then he walked into a rear room, where several other men were playing cards, and repeated his words.","she said, scornfully.",And she was determined to have him.,"Mebbe you'll take a man's word after this!""","But he had conquered those surges of passion, though the victory always left him with a smile on his face that would have awed Warden, had he seen it.",No cars--you can't get them!,"""I aim to be able to tell a coyote first pop, whether he's sneakin' in the sagebrush or settin' in a office.","When about midnight she heard the beating of hoofs near the cabin she sat very quiet, rigid, still determined, her eyes flashing with resolution.",In my right shoulder.,"""Don't be unpleasant, Hatfield.","The driving intensity of his desire to kill Warden, Singleton, and Slade would overwhelm him if he should find they had harmed Ruth.","And yet when they rode into the Two Diamond stable and dismounted, both men were breathless and tired; their legs and arms stiff with cold and their faces raw and blue from the bitter wind that had swirled around them.",Yet something in his eyes--the thing the two men had seen--gave the lie to the atmosphere of deliberate ease that radiated from him.,"Lawler halted just inside the door, to await the man's leisure.","He's layin' mighty low, an' keepin' his trap shut.","The man staggered back, clapping a hand to his head, where, it seemed to him, the bullet from the pistol had been aimed.",At this minute he was conscious of one thing only--that Slade was in Willets.,All youth is not ungainly.,There was a chill in Lawler's voice that brought Simmons rigid with a snap--as though he had suddenly been drenched with cold water.,They ain't no difference.,"For she saw, now, that it had been inevitable--that Lawler had acted in self-defense.",Caldwell and the others had driven their cattle to Red Rock also--not one of them visiting Warden to arrange for cars.,She never had loved Warden; she had not even respected him.,"""Della,"" she called; ""do you want anything?""","The flush left his face; he drew a deep, quick breath; then stood with open mouth, watching Lawler.","Do you understand that, Warden?""","Lawler lifted him bodily, threw him upon the pile of wood in the corner, where he lay huddled up, unconscious.","""I'm figurin' to do a man's work--tonight or tomorrow, Slade.",Call them what you like.,I rode close to the door and pounded on it.,Physical contact with the girl had brought his passions to life again.,"And at the last minute the convention was in danger of stampeding to him, threatening to nominate him despite his protests.","Added to that was disgust over the knowledge that Warden, and not Jim Lefingwell, was a liar--that Warden had no respect for the sacredness of his word, given to Lefingwell.","""I certainly wasn't expecting the norther to bring you.",A little later Lawler and Ruth and Shorty formed the van of the crowd that walked down the street toward the Wolf--where the Circle L men had left their horses.,It had been the incident of the fluttering handkerchief that had aroused him.,"He noted how she clasped her hands; how she nervously twined and untwined her fingers, and how she kept pushing her chair toward him, as though for protection.","That will be in addition to regular trail herd wages.""",When the herd reached the fence there was no break in it.,"When the afternoon began to wane the herd was far out in the basin, traveling steadily toward a point where the little river doubled, where Blackburn intended to camp for the night.","""Hamlin, I ought to kill you.",Yet Blackburn was determined.,"He peered close at Lawler, his eyes narrowing with suspicion, and then, finally, with savage amusement.","His eyes were glittering, his lips were stiff and white, and he was drawing great, long breaths that could be heard above the shuddering gasps of the horse he rode.",Not a sound escaped Link as he fell.,He lounged loosely in the saddle.,"And, shortly after noon they rode out of town together, Warden apparently in the best of humor over finding her safe; Della elated over the success of the deception.","He was setting a bad example for the other pupils.""",He meant to be generous in the moment of victory.,There won't be a stick standin' when I get through!,And chance---- Here Gary Warden's face flashed in her mental vision.,"Anyways, the gang didn't appear in no hurry to unload the hosses; an' a trainman yells to them, sayin' they'd have to hurry.","But incidentally, they're going to mulct every other cattle owner in the state.","""An' we'd better hit the breeze right now, for she's comin' fast.""","The running horse and the crouching rider were still a mile from Lawler; but even at that distance Lawler recognized Shorty, and he urged Red King on to meet him, suspecting that nothing but a stern emergency would make the man race his horse at that speed.","They brought up at the Rabbit Ear, at that old house of Rud Dickman's--who cashed in three or four years ago, leavin' nobody behind him.""","Deep in his heart, though, lurked a spark of passion that, day by day, had been slowly growing, warming him, making his veins swell a little when his thoughts dwelt upon Warden and the others; bringing into his heart a savage longing that he often had yielded to in the old days--before he had learned to control his passions.","Streaks of flame were splitting the darkness in the basin; there were reports of pistols--which were reduced to mere faint, popping noises by the distance they traveled before reaching the ears of Antrim and his men; they saw the herd start; heard it go thundering up the valley in a cloud of dust and strike the edge of the plain above, to swing eastward toward Kinney's ca√±on.","He had lived a rough, hard life, in which values were computed by the rule of sheer worth--a life that had taught him that performance, and not appearances, must be the standard by which all men and women must ultimately be judged.","""And you have been acting dreadfully distant.","I ain't said anything to the boys, but it's likely they've seen 'em, too--for they've got their eyes peeled.",Lawler could dimly see the herd moving toward the fence; he could see the men plainly; and as he watched them his eyes narrowed.,Toward the close of the second day corrugations began to appear in the level.,"""Warden didn't say nothin'--he'd lost his voice, I reckon.",Hatfield narrowed his eyes and studied Lawler's face.,"I reckon he's gone.""","""Two days,"" advised Lawler.",1.F.,And we won't force him.
