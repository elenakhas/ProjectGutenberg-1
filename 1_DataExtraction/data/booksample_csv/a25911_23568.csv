"""Catch them before they harm Uncle Al!","""I can bone-feel the Harmon boat a-comin', young fella,"" he said, using the pipe to gesture with.",Jimmy gulped and gestured wildly toward the bend.,"To grow up with them, Jimmy--and to understand them.",Jimmy started to take hold of his sister's wrist and pry the paper from her clasp.,"""W--Who are you?""","In his mind's gaze Jimmy saw himself holding the Harmon brothers up by their long, mottled legs.",*       *       *       *       * The river could rise fast too.,"But a hollow, sick feeling in his chest couldn't mean anything by itself, he told himself fiercely.",But now the blow was coming from just one part of the sky.,"NEW FLYING MONSTER REPORTED                         BLAZING GULF STATE SKIES Jimmy snatched the paper and backed away from Pigtail, his eyes glued to the headline.",They're white and thin and transparent and have to struggle hard to survive and grow up.,Just as though a giant in the sky had trained a big burning glass on the Harmon brothers and whipped it back quick.,"_Hurry!_"" There was a strange lifting sensation in Jimmy's chest now.","""Don't you dare!","It was less than thirty feet away now, drifting straight past and rocking with the tide like a topheavy flatbarge.",Down the river in the sunlight a shantyboat was drifting.,"""You see, Jimmy, our race was once entirely human.","For wide wastes of years we have cruised Earth's skies, almost unnoticed by the Earth people.","Then we can show ourselves to them as we really are, and help them openly.""","""You can be right smart when you've got nothing else on your mind, Pigtail,"" he said.",Then the voices began again.,There was a white core of anger in Jimmy which seemed suddenly to blaze up.,"Then as Jimmy stared into the depths of the strange glow behind his eyelids the city dwindled and fell away, and he saw a huge circular disk looming in a wilderness of shadows.",Jimmy obeyed.,"Lower and lower the disk swept, trailing plumes of white smoke, lashing the water with a fearful blow.","""Kidnap plot linked to airliner crash killing fifty,"" she read.","We're going to take you across wide gulfs of space to the bright and shining land of your birth.""","Crazy, crazy, you hear?""",But before he could get a really good look at the shining object it pierced the shadows and passed into the disk.,But Uncle Al wasn't sitting on the deck.,"So big and bright that Jimmy could see the faces of the Harmon brothers fifty times as large as life, shriveling and disappearing in a magnifying burst of flame high above the cypress trees.","Very close to Jimmy, but larger, more powerful.","""You were carried by your parents into a waiting ship, and then out across wide gulfs of space to Earth.","Straight down out of the sky the disk swooped, a huge, spinning shape as flat as a buckwheat cake swimming in a golden haze of butterfat.",Only started--for as Pigtail wriggled back sunlight fell on a shadowed part of the paper which drew Jimmy's gaze as sunlight draws dew.,True--Jimmy had no respect for packet boats and deserved a good trouncing.,"Jed was passing the sticks along to his brother, depending on wad dynamite to silence Uncle Al forever.","They were frogs too, maybe, but good frogs.","""Watched?","The voice paused, then went on quickly.","Jimmy was scared, all right.","""Take it easy, Jimmy!","Not friendly, good natured frogs like Uncle Al, but snake frogs.","But it took courage too, and a willingness to believe that you were more than human, and armed with the great proud strength and wisdom of the Shining Ones.""",The Harmon brothers were not in the least alike.,"*       *       *       *       * A long silence while the river mists seemed to weave a bright cocoon of radiance about Jimmy clinging to the bank, and the great circular disk that had swallowed up Uncle Al.","Jimmy started to reply, then shut his mouth tight.",he said sympathetically.,"We're just going to have a friendly little talk with Uncle Al.""","It seemed to blaze out of the page at Jimmy as he stared, his chin nudging Pigtail's shoulder.",Slowly Uncle Al and Pigtail were drawn into the disk.,"I've a right to see what's going on in the world!""","That meant Jimmy was the man in the family, and wore the pants, and nothing Pigtail said or did could change that for one minute.",Jimmy turned pale.,"The waves rose and rose, and Jimmy's cheeks swelled out and the river kept getting angrier.",But what a scrapper the lad was!,"""A planet's not a star, Pigtail,"" he said patiently.","""No you won't, young fella!","""Nobody knows where they come from!",You hear me?,"Closer and closer the shining object came, until Jimmy could see that it was carrying a human infant that stared straight at Jimmy out of wide, dark eyes.","What you talking about?""","But you're still young enough to feel human, and we want you to feel human, Jimmy.""","Grabbing Pigtail Anne by the arm, he propelled her across the deck and into the dismal front room of the shantyboat.","""You heard what I said, young fella.","Up and down the river Pigtail Anne was known as a tomboy, but she wasn't--no-ways.","*       *       *       *       * He was kind to his sister, however.","Jimmy could see Uncle Al reclining in the web, with Pigtail in the crook of his arm, his long, angular body as quiet as a butterfly in its deep winter sleep inside a swaying glass cocoon.","Beside him Joe Harmon stood quivering like a mound of jelly, a stick of dynamite in his hand, his flabby face looking almost gentle in the slanting sunlight.","Sucking the still air deep into his lungs, Jimmy swung about.",the voice said.,"As the _Natchez Belle_ dwindled around a lazy, cypress-shadowed bend Pigtail Anne became a superior being, wrapped in a cosmopolitan aura.","""Save Uncle Al!""","""You see, Jimmy, we wanted you to study the Earth people on a great, wide flowing river, far from the cruel, twisted places.","Around the bend in the sunlight came a great spinning disk, wrapped in a fiery glow.","""I want to stay here and fight with you, Uncle Al,"" Jimmy said.",Jimmy heard himself protesting.,There was no deck for Uncle Al to sit upon.,"""Shucks, it was nothing!""","Uncle Al was shooting now, his face as grim as death.","It was strange, though.","You see, Jimmy, we must watch and protect the young of our race until sturdiness comes upon them, and they are ready for the Great Change."""
