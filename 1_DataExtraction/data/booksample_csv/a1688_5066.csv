and, with no moment now to spare, yet wishing not to lose my small silver clue, I just put it here for one of the white pebbles, or whatever they were, that Hop o' my Thumb, carried off to the forest, dropped, as he went, to know his way back.",I simply gasped.,"Not only the quality of his mercy, but also of his admiration, is quite unstrained.","He shook hands with us hastily and abstractedly, and asked if he might speak to me inside the house.","Her voice sort of shook, and I thought I'd better settle it for her one way or the other, so I nodded and said, ""Wouldn't be surprised,"" and then, if you'll believe it, that girl got angry--at ME.","If it was about anybody but your aunt Elizabeth I would, but I can't speak against her.","""Forgive, Peggy,"" she moaned.","Not so you'd notice it.""","Then he said, in the same queer voice: “Is Mrs. Peter in?","And now that it's come,” she went on, bravely, “we can only just do as we always have done--and not make any difference--can we?” “Except that I feel I must be here, because we can't know from minute to minute what may come up.” “You feel you can't leave me, mother.","Or p'r'aps I should in justice say, to what, in an Adelphi play, is known as situation.""",The usual farewell performance was in progress.,Glad to see you!” and offered his hand over the low coping so cordially that I felt warranted in holding it a moment.,"He has started what they call a little movement of the kind now, and is training two young scriveners.""","She shook her head, with that look that makes you feel sometimes that she isn't just the gentle and placid person that she appears to be.","Sid hurriedly scrubbed it with his handkerchief, but even that didn't really make it clean, and by that time you couldn't read the address.","That's about all that seems to keep some of them going when they get old.” I knew that here he had his mother-in-law rather than his daughter in mind, and I didn't interrupt the sarcastic silence into which he fell.","And then he made me tell him further what Peggy said and what I said, and he laughed that time about my comforting her, though I don't see why.","At ten o'clock there was only one person in the house, perhaps in Eastridge, who was ignorant of our daughter's singular fortune.","""I've got to!""","He said it was all rot, anyway, and that Harry was a nice boy, but not worth making such a fuss over.","She was standing up on a chair, with one of his hands to steady her.","We found Lorraine and Charles Edward standing in the middle of the room, holding hands and looking at each other.","Surely it will do no harm if I glance at it.""","But there was a blockade on the way, and I wasn't on time.","There was something else there, too--a dark, wet, pulpy, soggy-looking thing with pieces of gum and molasses candy and other things sticking to it.","When I found that she wasn't crying; when I got face to face with that soft, fine excitement in the eyes which a girl wears when she has a love-affair, not stagnant, but in action--I concluded at once that Peggy had her reservations and was keeping something from me.","Two or three days ago I heard Grandma Evarts say something to the minister about ""the down-trodden and oppressed of foreign lands,"" and after he had gone I asked her what they were.","I could of course scarce believe my eyes when, at the turn of a quiet alley, pulling up to gape, I recognized in a young man brooding on a bench ten yards off the precious personality of Harry Goward!","I know they mean to be nice to me, but they take it for granted that every habit Charles Edward has or hasn't, and everything he does or doesn't, is because I didn't do something that I ought to have done, or condoned something that I ought not.",I have this precious document in my pocket.,"Well, I drove round by the Red Bridge, and was gone an hour and twelve minutes, and I thought they'd be missing me and in a fit to get home, so I just raced Hotspur the last mile.","We of course don't know--that is Mother and Grandmamma don't, in any definite way (any more than I do, thanks to my careful stupidity) how exceeding small some of the material is consciously ground in the great grim, thrifty mill of industrial success; and indeed we grow about as many cheap illusions and easy comforts in the faintly fenced garden of our little life as could very well be crammed into the space.","A journalist, a rolling stone, a man who has seen other life, how can one not suspect him of some deeper game than he avows--some such studious, surreptitious, ""sociological"" intent as alone, it would seem, could sustain him through the practice of leaning on his fence at eventide to converse for long periods with poor Father?","Queer enough the superstition that Granny is a very solid and strenuous and rather grim person, with a capacity for facing the world, that we, a relaxed generation, have weakly lost.",VII.,It did look smudgy.,"Aunt Elizabeth doesn't know how many times I have smoothed matters over for her, how many times Cyrus has been provoked because he thought she didn't show enough consideration for me.","However, Maria HAS Tom.",Aunt Elizabeth came closer and put her hands on my shoulders.,III.,"Tom had dashed it there and blown off somewhere, leaving me, as he usually does, to make my own decisions.",Peggy pushed back her cloud of bright hair and fastened it in the nape of her neck.,"Finally I crept out of the house without saying a word to her or letting her know I was there, and I leaned on the gate to think it over and try to imagine what a girl in a book would do.",I must leave my address for Tom pinned up somewhere.,"""One's the gas-bill,"" said Billy, ""and one's for you.""",The toad or lizard that couldn't be livelier than he is would be a pretty sad animal.,"""Mind?","""I not only thought of it,"" said Goward, ""but I was.","If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder.","He put his hands in his pockets, threw back his handsome head, and then and there, in that sacred feminine vestibule, he laughed as no woman could laugh if she tried.","""As for you, sir!""",Which reminds me that I ought to explain how I got Dr. Denbigh to let me write this for Lorraine.,"When her babies were born I was with her; I helped her bring them up; as I have grown older, though she comes to me less and less, wishing to spare me, I seem to need less telling; for I know myself when anything ails her.","""Sha'n't I?""","I told her so, too; but, of course, she only looked at me over her spectacles and didn't understand what I meant.","Cyrus loved them all, but the only one he thought he understood was Peggy, and her he usually misunderstood, because she was so much like him.",I looked forward with fear to what Ada might have to go through if it didn't turn out all right.,"She didn't; she cleared out with solidity and despatch, and my Aurora, as the school-teacher would say, came in his whirling car, and in I popped, and we had a corking time.","I stood there hesitating because, of course, I didn't know who to give it to, and Grandma Evarts shot out, ""Well, Alice!",She is a case of arrested development.,“I never even saw his uncle.,"Coming away in such a hurry, he must telegraph to the Works.","As Peggy's brother, it will be more suitable for him to attend to the matter.""","I believe they had gotten him out of petticoats and into trousers, but much as ever, and my skirts were still abbreviated.","""I can't make head or tail of it.","They were looking the other way, so they didn't notice my fish-line either.",That looks like Peggy's suit-case the porter's carrying down.,"He wrote me about you.""","Then Mr. Goward told me all those things at the dance, how he had found life a bitter waste, how he had been betrayed over and over by the vain and worldly, and how his heart was dead and nobody could bring it to life but me.","Really, I don't hate him at all.","So we drove along, chaffing and laughing, until we came to the dear, old, ugly house.","“The Happy Family.”--It is day after tomorrow, and Tom and I are going to take the noon train home.",I am going to New York by the early morning express--the 7.20.,"We quarrelled, and he went into the smoker.","For his misfortune has, of course, not changed my knowledge of his nature.","Then Peggy cried out, ""Oh, Aunt Elizabeth, how dreadful!",I could have danced and sung with happiness.,"""The Happy Family.""","You know Harry left quite unexpectedly--soon after Elizabeth came; he didn't write for a week--and then to her, and Peggy's only had one short note from him--"" I can see through a hole in a millstone as well as any one, and a light dawned on me.",They were all seated at the table already--supper is not a movable feast in that well-regulated establishment--save Aunt Elizabeth.,"I try to do justice to every one, and I hope I am not unfair when I say that the best of men, and Cyrus is one of them, are sometimes blind and obstinate.","Peggy gasped and said, ""Oh--oh!"
