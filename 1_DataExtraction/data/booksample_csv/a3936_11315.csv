"and a happy smile they could scarce believe their eyes and ears, for they thought it was Matilda.","There was a roller coaster which knew just when to stop and start so that none of the children could ever hurt themselves upon it, and a little play grocery, a little play candy store, and a little play ice cream parlor so that the children could go there at any time and get cookies and candy and ice cream whenever they wished.","""There are hundreds of children just like you who make hard work of getting up when they are called in the morning and who remain cross and ugly all day long!""",said the wife as she picked the bottle up to look at it.,Then he dipped the kettle into the sea and placed the crab and the lobster in the kettle of water and put the lid on.,She was always unhappy.,"""Why, I'm Merry Chuckle from Make-Believe Land!""","""How pretty!""","""Oh, but indeed you can help it, Marjorie!""",Now Sally Migrundy had always lived in her tiny cottage on the bank of the tinkling stream which ran through the whispering forest.,"And Billy Bumblebee said to Old Man Hoppy-toad, ""Now you must leave our neighborhood, for we do not permit anyone to bother anyone else in the Town of Tinythings.""","""The presents were not for me, Katrinka!""","""Let's go up higher so that we can see them better,"" Willy Ladybug said.","And you must smile and be friendly just as I would do.""","Would you, Friend Lobster?'","""This is the end!""",So they all lifted Grumpy Grundy on a chair and wiped her eyes and what do you think!,"Each morning she would scatter food upon the surface of the singing stream and the lovely fish, their sides reflecting rainbow colors, would leap from the tinkling waters and splash about to show their pleasure.","and the answering notes of plaintive melody, ""Toowoo-toowoo Tooawoooooo!""","[Illustration] And, while Sally Migrundy remains a tiny little lady only two feet high, she has as much happiness inside as if she were as large as a great big mountain, for as you have probably also guessed, she is a fairy and can have as much room inside for happiness as the little magic cottage could have room inside for all the happy children.",So Thumbkins fell fast asleep and dreamed the most pleasant dreams.,"Then there were a few more squeals of laughter, and the four pink feet pitter-patted across the floor and Johnny could see the owners hop into a snow-white bed.","""I know where there is a box full of candy!""",However Sally Migrundy's tiny cottage is just the same tiny cottage on the outside.,"""I am very glad that we are green, too.""","""They have the little nook right across the hall!""","[Illustration] And, as she turned it, she saw the figures of her childhood playmates turn before her upon her lap, and they joined their voices with the silvery notes of the violin's long ago songs until the attic was filled with the melody and the figures danced from her lap and, taking her by the hand, circled in the center of the attic room laughing and singing.",Timidly they opened the door and looked in.,"""Oh dear!""","There was Mamma Meadow-Lark sitting upon her nest with her head tucked under her wing, sound asleep.","""Let us fly way up in the air so that we may look down over all the country!""",said the lobster.,"""Pooh!""","""Yes!",cried all the objects upon the shelf.,"Thumbkins said, so he hopped out of his warm little bed and lit his tiny lantern.","In fact, Sally Migrundy's living room was larger inside than the whole little cottage was on the outside, for, as you have probably guessed, Sally Migrundy's cottage was a magic house.",And suddenly the scene changed!,"""You are indeed very welcome,"" Mamma Meadow-Lark replied, ""and any time it rains you can come back to my nest and crawl beneath my wing and keep warm and dry.","The old lady sat very still and dreamed, for her brother was playing one of their childhood songs.","So Johnny started to climb over the mantel shelf and down the side of the fireplace when there came a puff of wind down the chimney which made the stockings swing away out into the room, and snowflakes fluttered clear across the room.","""How do you like that?""","Johnny's toe struck something hard, he yawned, rubbed his eyes and looked into the boot.","The little old man had been playing with his eyes closed, but as the songs grew louder he opened them and beheld the ring of little figures, with his sister holding hands with two of them.","""After a while,"" Grand'pa Skeeterhawk continued, ""They got up courage to peek out of the mud, and as they saw nothing to frighten them, they formed in a circle and told more tales of their fighting qualities.","But when he held his tiny lantern close, Thumbkins could see that she shivered as the cold raindrops splashed upon her back.","Marjorie cried, for she thought him the most comical little creature she had ever seen.","They had not gone far until they met Wallie Woodpecker, who also was singing happily.",said a deep voice from inside the tin can house.,"Finally when all the guests had gone, Matilda saw Katrinka gather up half of the presents and put them in a basket.","*** START:

lobster's back.","There was a tiny tinkle from a bell and, just as Johnny hopped behind the clock, he saw a boot stick out of the fireplace.","Johnny Cricket was too cold to stop and put on his little red boots, but scrambled through the crack in the fireplace and hopped into bed.",[Illustration] [Illustration] THE TWIN SISTERS Everybody in the little village called them the twin houses because they were built exactly alike.,"""Suppose you climb upon my back, Thumbkins, and let me help you find her!""","He was out in the woods, with lofty trees towering above him, while all about, laughing and talking, were hundreds of little fairies, gnomes and sprites, and there, too, were the playmates of long ago, just as he had seen them when he had closed his eyes and played in the attic.","When all was finished and the tiny rugs had been placed just right, they heard a stamping of tiny feet in the hallway.",the wishbone answered.,"Merry Chuckle replied, quick as a wink, his little eyes twinkling brightly.","And there was Willie Woodchuck with the beautiful yellow and red and blue and black and white rattle, and when he rattled it Grumpy Grundy rolled on the floor and laughed until the tears ran from her eyes.","Tim Tim called, putting his hands to his mouth and forming a sort of horn.","""Hello, Marjorie!""","""Yes, indeed!""",said the crab.,The other little gnome tip-toed up and joined his brother and when they had listened a while they winked at each other and quietly walked back to the beach.,Presently Willy Ladybug saw a strange fish in the water.,"And all the children avoided Matilda, for, sometimes mistaking her for Katrinka and running close to greet her, they would have their noses tweeked for their trouble.","""Have you seen Mrs. Thumbkins, Tommy Grasshopper?""","And each morning when they tumbled, laughing and shouting, out of their little snow white beds, they found underneath a new present.","""Was anyone hurt when the top of the tree fell?""",He is not large enough.,"Tommy Grasshopper, Johnny Cricket and Willy Ladybug were playing on a high bank of the river, and watching the little fish jumping after tiny flies and bugs that fell upon the surface of the stream.","""Hmm!""","""That's a catfish!""",Tim Tim cried cheerily.,"Old clothes changed to new!""","""Don't the people in the house here wish good luck?""",I know I should not be able to stand it!,"It was a magic soda fountain, as the children soon found out, and they could have all the soda water they wished at any time.",said Mamma and Papa Cricket.,"HUMMMM!""",Two long hairs grew from his eyebrows and curled over his cap.
