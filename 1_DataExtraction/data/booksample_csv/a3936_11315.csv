"""After a while,"" Grand'pa Skeeterhawk continued, ""They got up courage to peek out of the mud, and as they saw nothing to frighten them, they formed in a circle and told more tales of their fighting qualities.","The little old man had been playing with his eyes closed, but as the songs grew louder he opened them and beheld the ring of little figures, with his sister holding hands with two of them.","""And I wish for a million golden pennies piled high upon the kitchen table!""","""In the middle of the great meadow, and it will belong to the one who finds it first.""","""No, I will go, Katrinka!""","cried Marjorie, ""and I just hate to go to the store!",Thumbkins said.,"""Oh dear!","You must live in my house and pretend that you are me, and I will live in your house and pretend that I am you!",The door was so small the children had to get down upon their hands and knees to crawl through.,This was his way of thinking very hard.,"Are their heads flat?""",It was the Fairy Ring.,"Then Dickie ran back home and had some more ice cream and candy, and asked Daddy if he might take some of the golden pennies downtown and buy something, and Daddy Dorn said: ""Of course, Dickie Dorn, for they are your golden pennies.""","""She has not been home all day!""","Thumbkins thanked Mamma Meadow-Lark again, and told her of his nice warm cozy little nest beneath the mushroom.",Old Man Hoppy-toad had locked her in the kitchen so she would have to bake lots and lots of pancakes for him.,"And sure enough that was the case, for although they had eaten almost all of the ice cream and candy before now the two boxes were filled again.","""So the catfish, although they were so frightened that their fins grew stiff, decided that they would follow their chief, for they expected he would be the first to hide under the mud when the big beast came.","When the little nut took root and sent its tiny shoots up in the air, the old, rough Stone said, ""There!","Timothy Toad cried, ""Willie Woodchuck is, whittling because he has nothing else to do!""","By the time Dickie reached home he was hungry for more ice cream and candy, so he went to the box to get some.","Then there were a few more squeals of laughter, and the four pink feet pitter-patted across the floor and Johnny could see the owners hop into a snow-white bed.",Then I turned around and came back the same way.,"""Where are you going in such a hurry?""","""Sure enough, I did crawl out of bed backwards this morning!""","""'Shall we fight the big hawk who wades in the water and catches some of us?'",said the sister.,"cried the child with the longest part of the broken wishbone, ""The room will be filled with candy!""","The third crow now cried, ""Awww!",asked a little kitten fish.,The door was closed.,So Thumbkins climbed up the flower stalk and took a seat upon Billy Bumblebee's back.,"The little bottle floated along, tumbling over the tiny falls and tinkling ripples and bobbing up and down in the deep, blue, quiet, places until finally it floated to Sally Migrundy's and came to rest in the mass of pretty flowers where Sally Migrundy came each morning to dip her tiny bucket of water.","""Good morning, Dickie!""","""I know you did, my dear!""","Thumbkins kept very quiet, for the baby meadow-larks were sleepy little fellows, and before he knew it Thumbkins was sound asleep himself, with an arm around one of the baby birds.","""I wish that this kitchen were just filled with candy and cake, then we could eat all we wish to!""","""I really do not mean to be cross, but I just can't help it sometimes!""","""OOOHooooo!""","The first crow cried, ""I know where there is a box filled with golden pennies!""","As he did so, the figures rose in the air and seemed to grow lighter and larger.",And all were greatly pleased at the great change in Grumpy Grundy.,"Presently the raindrops began to patter on the round top of the mushroom and ""drip-dropped"" to the ground without getting Thumbkins' little house the least bit wet.","""Caw-AAAAH!","""Here they come!""","he said, and told her about the iron ring.","""I do not know!""","And, looking about him with shining eyes, he again drew his bow across the strings and played a tune so lively and full of sweet happiness the childhood friends caught hands and danced in a circle, and the little sprites, elves, gnomes and fairies caught hands and danced around the children, and as they passed before the brother he caught a mischievous glance from the eyes of one of the little fairies, and he knew in a moment she was the one who had played the old woman, and who had given him the iron ring....","Why, I not only pulled him in the water and dragged him all over the bottom, but I made him promise he would never disturb any of the catfish tribe after this!'","""This is our birthday and I have brought you half of the presents which were given me!",One day Thumbkins was passing through the meadow and it began to rain.,"And never again did another tree grow above the old, rough Stone to keep him company.",He is not large enough.,"Matilda watched the party from her dark window and the longer she watched, the more angry she grew, for the longer the party lasted, the louder grew the happy laughter.","""How wonderful it must have been!""","""Well, I will tell you, Tom Tom,"" Tim Tim answered, ""You know Mrs. Fuzzytail lived with her grandchildren squirrels up in the top of the tree, and they had a very cozy den up there, too, but Mrs. Fuzzytail wished to make some small improvements, such as a new peep-hole window and a little cupboard for Chinkapins and hickory nuts.",In another room were two little snow white beds.,"""I have never enjoyed myself so much before, and I will never be grumpy and be called a Grundy again!","My brother, where?""",Finally the pounding ceased and the man leaned over and kissed the owners of the pink feet.,Now Katrinka had called Matilda over to her own house to see the changes she had made and Matilda was beginning to see what she had missed all along.,Ever so much longer!,"Finally when all the guests had gone, Matilda saw Katrinka gather up half of the presents and put them in a basket.",and he disliked the tree from that time on.,They had not gone far before they met Billie Bumblebee.,Thumbkins thought to himself as he stood and looked at her.,Then Daddy Dorn took two large handfuls of golden pennies from the golden penny box and they watched the box fill up with pennies again.,"""And I am going to tell you how.","""I will buzz down that way and see him!""","""Oh, Granpa Tobackyworm!","""Yes, you do!""","Sally Migrundy was very much surprised to see the two children, for she had almost forgotten she had written the invitation.","""Watch the room fill with candy!""","he said, when the two Toads stopped him.","So the people never called Granny a witch after that, for they knew she was very good and kindly.","""Was anyone hurt when the top of the tree fell?""",Johnny was still very sleepy and could hardly keep his eyes open as he reached for his little red-topped boots.,"""We are going back to see him!""",But just then Tom Tom Teenyweeny walked in the door.,Then the children came romping into the kitchen.,"""I wish another squirrel would come to eat nuts upon me!""",Have you seen Mrs. Thumbkins?
