"We saw that Thales made some remarkable measurements with the aid of shadows, and we have more than once referred to the gnomon, which is the most primitive, but which long remained the most important, of astronomical instruments.","With either form water may be lifted, by the mere turning of the screw, to any desired height.",The idea is perhaps made clearer if we picture the actual progress of the lantern attached to the rim of an ordinary cart-wheel.,"Had he done so, perhaps he might have reflected, like Aristarchus before him, that it seems absurd for our earth to hold the giant sun in thraldom; then perhaps his imagination would have reached out to the heliocentric doctrine, and the cobweb hypothesis of epicycles, with that yet more intangible figment of the perfect circle, might have been wiped away.",No line alleged to have been written by Pythagoras has come down to us.,Upon them devolved the duty of predicting the time of the Nile flood; a duty they were enabled to perform without difficulty through observation of the rising of the solstitial sun and its Sothic messenger.,"Doubtless this is fiction, yet, as usual with such fictions, it contains a germ of truth; for we may well suppose that the promulgator of the atomic theory was a man whose mind was attracted by the subtleties of thought rather than by the tangibilities of observation.","But in recognizing the time of the inundations and the vernal equinox, the Assyrians did not dethrone the moon from its accustomed precedence, for the year was reckoned as commencing not precisely at the vernal equinox, but at the new moon next before the equinox.",Even at a very early period the Romans recognized the advantage of surgical methods on the field of battle.,"In other words, the first stage of picture-writing did not go beyond the mere representation of an eagle by the picture of an eagle.","These, then, were the preliminary data required by Eratosthenes.","They were not hospitals in our modern understanding of the term, but were more like dispensaries, where patients were treated temporarily, but were not allowed to remain for any length of time.","As it is, he seems rather disposed to quote any interesting citation that he comes across in his omnivorous readings, shielding himself behind an equivocal ""it is said,"" or ""so and so alleges.""",We have sufficiently detailed the theory in speaking of Hipparchus.,Little wonder that the thinker whose science carried him to such scepticism as this should have felt the wrath of the superstitious Athenians.,XI.,GREEK SCIENCE OF THE ALEXANDRIAN OR HELLENISTIC PERIOD We are entering now upon the most important scientific epoch of antiquity.,"He made also a careful and fairly accurate study of the anatomy of the eye, a greatly improved the old operation for cataract.","""But Archimedes having told King Hiero, his kinsman and friend, that it was possible to remove as great a weight as he would, with as little strength as he listed to put to it: and boasting himself thus (as they report of him) and trusting to the force of his reasons, wherewith he proved this conclusion, that if there were another globe of earth, he was able to remove this of ours, and pass it over to the other: King Hiero wondering to hear him, required him to put his device in execution, and to make him see by experience, some great or heavy weight removed, by little force.","If, then, our own calendar were so defective that in the course of 120 years the month of February had shifted back to occupy the position of the original January, the change would have been so gradual, covering the period of two life-times or of four or five average generations, that it might well escape general observation.","This, of course, amounts to a full day every fourth year.","In it place the mamit,   2. in the sick man's right hand.",In considering it we shall have to do with the very last great scientist of the Alexandrian school.,"The diameter of the shadow (cast by the earth at the point where the moon's orbit cuts that shadow when the moon is eclipsed) is double the diameter of the moon.""","And nous ruled the rotation of the whole, so that it set it in rotation in the beginning.","Of the three other great Italic leaders of thought of the early period, Xenophanes came rather late in life to Elea and founded the famous Eleatic School, of which Parmenides became the most distinguished ornament.","A few illustrations, drawn from Greek literature at various ages, will suggest the popular attitude.","He was not merely an astronomer and a geographer, but a poet and grammarian as well.","And with each succeeding period of four years the day of heliacal rising, which marked the true beginning of the year--and which still, of course, coincided with the inundation--would have fallen another day behind the calendar.","These studies tended to authenticate the essential fact on which the legend of Kadmus was founded; to the extent, at least, of making it probable that the later Grecian alphabet was introduced from Phoenicia--though not, of course, by any individual named Kadmus, the latter being, indeed, a name of purely Greek origin.",He was quite correct in finding that the sun spends more time on one side of the equator than on the other.,This may be the explanation of the tradition of the speaking statue in the temple of Ammon at Thebes.,So much for Democritus the man.,"Then a lump of pure silver of the same weight was similarly immersed; lastly the crown itself was immersed, and of course--for the story must not lack its dramatic sequel--was found bulkier than its weight of pure gold.","As already noted, the existing tablets chance not to throw much light on the subject.","TWO FAMOUS EXPOSITORS--PLINY AND PTOLEMY While Strabo was pursuing his geographical studies at Alexandria, a young man came to Rome who was destined to make his name more widely known in scientific annals than that of any other Latin writer of antiquity.","Here, as elsewhere, it is impossible to admire him for any high development of theoretical science.","There were besides these quacks, however, reputable eye-doctors who must have possessed considerable skill in the treatment of certain ophthalmias.","While the astrologers deduced their omens from all the celestial bodies known to them, they chiefly gave attention to the moon, noting with great care the shape of its horns, and deducing such a conclusion as that ""if the horns are pointed the king will overcome whatever he goreth,"" and that ""when the moon is low at its appearance, the submission (of the people) of a far country will come.","His knowledge of the structure and arrangement of the bones, however, was fairly accurate, but the anatomy of the softer tissues, as he conceived it, was a queer jumbling together of blood-vessels, muscles, and tendons.","Here we see each side hesitating to attack the other, merely because the oracle had declared that whichever side struck the first blow would lose the conflict.","We are constrained, then, to believe that the inventive genius who was really responsible for the mechanisms we are about to describe was Ctesibius, the master.","As already noted, the heliocentric doctrine is not expressly stated here.","But, on the other hand, that a small body like the earth should revolve about the gigantic sun seemed inherently probable.","Doubtless this, like most similar good sayings, is apocryphal; but whoever invented it has made the world his debtor.",Hence geographers came to think of the habitable globe as having the somewhat lenticular shape which a crude map of these regions suggests.,"And this change of the day Thales, the Milesian, had foretold to the Ionians, laying down as a limit this very year in which the change took place.",A new and most important element was added to the science of astronomy.,"Shortly after this, however, the superstitious Nicon, following the interpretations of a dream, decided that his son should take up the study of medicine, and placed him under the instruction of several learned physicians.",Yet the same eyes that witnessed these scenes with ecstatic approval would have been averted in pious horror had an anatomist dared to approach one of the mutilated bodies with the scalpel of science.,"""(14) That the idea of transmutation of parts, as well as of mere homology, was in mind is evidenced by a very remarkable sentence in which Aristotle asserts, ""Empedocles says that fingernails rise from sinew from hardening.""","), on the arms, or on the feet, everywhere he meets with the heart, because its vessels lead to all the members.","He might claim for his largest atom the same quality of substance as for his smallest, but so long as he conceived that the large atoms, when adjusted together to form a tangible substance, formed a substance different in quality from the substance which the small atoms would make up when similarly grouped, this concession amounts to the predication of difference of quality between the atoms themselves.","The forcible elevation of Nuit had been effected on the day of creation by a new god, Shu, who came forth from the primeval waters.",Plato himself speaks to us directly.,"His tenets were accepted as final by their great popularizer, Ptolemy, three centuries later; and so the heliocentric theory of Aristarchus passed under a cloud almost at the hour of its dawning, there to remain obscured and forgotten for the long lapse of centuries.",Yet this discrepancy does not in the least take away from the validity of the method which Aristarchus employed.,"Moreover, let us urge again that this was no mere accidental flight of the imagination; it was a scientific induction based on the only data available; perhaps it is not too much to say that it was the only scientific induction which these data would fairly sustain.",So fond were the Egyptians of their pictorial symbols used ideographically that they clung to them persistently throughout the entire period of Egyptian history.,"Fish was forbidden on certain days; and what was still more difficult in a country so rich in mice, on the 12th of Tybi no mouse might be seen.","So, too, Nicetas must be named among those whom rumor credited with having taught that the world is in motion.","He was a practical physician as well as a theorist, and, withal, a clear and concise writer.","Yet, as we have said, some genius of prehistoric Egypt conceived the idea and put it into practical execution, and the hieroglyphic writing of which the Egyptians were in full possession at the very beginning of what we term the historical period made use of this phonetic system along with the ideographic system already described.","Eratosthenes, the inventive world-measurer, was succeeded by Strabo, the industrious collator of facts; Aristarchus and Hipparchus, the originators of new astronomical methods, were succeeded by Ptolemy, the perfecter of their methods and the systematizer of their knowledge.","The wealthy Romans, who owned large estates and numerous slaves, were in the habit of purchasing some of these slave doctors, and thus saving medical fees by having them attend to the health of their families.","His words are as follows: ""Xenophanes believes that once the earth was mingled with the sea, but in the course of time it became freed from moisture; and his proofs are such as these: that shells are found in the midst of the land and among the mountains, that in the quarries of Syracuse the imprints of a fish and of seals had been found, and in Paros the imprint of an anchovy at some depth in the stone, and in Melite shallow impressions of all sorts of sea products.","Some commentators have thought that Aristotle merely referred to the area of the inhabited portion of the earth and not to the circumference of the earth itself, but his words seem doubtfully susceptible of this interpretation; and if he meant, as his words seem to imply, that philosophers of his day had a tolerably precise idea of the globe, we must assume that this idea was based upon some sort of measurement.","Furthermore, we know that condemned criminals were sometimes handed over to the medical profession to be ""operated upon and killed in whatever way they thought best"" even as late as the sixteenth century.","All that was required, then, was to measure, at Alexandria, the angular distance of the sun from the zenith at noon on the day of the solstice to secure an approximate measurement of the arc of the sun's circumference, corresponding to the arc of the earth's surface represented by the measured distance between Alexandria and Syene.","We need not doubt, therefore, that for the Egyptian this solid vault of the heavens had a very real existence.","Thus Ritter interprets him as supposing ""that the earth is in the centre spherical, and maintained in rotary motion by its equiponderance; around it lie certain rings, the highest composed of the rare element fire, the next lower a compound of light and darkness, and lowest of all one wholly of night, which probably indicated to his mind the surface of the earth, the centre of which again he probably considered to be fire.",His worship was essentially solar.,"He had perforce learned some things about astronomy, because these were necessary to his worship of the gods; about practical medicine, because this ministered to his material needs; about practical arithmetic, because this aided him in every-day affairs.","This man, said he, employs our ships as buckets to draw water: and boxing about our sackbuts, as if they were unworthy to be associated with him, drives them from his company with disgrace.",Could we analyze the details of this civilization from its earliest to its latest period we should of course find the same changes which always attend racial progress and decay.,"He had gathered also a company of great teachers and founded a school of science which, as has just been said, made Alexandria the culture-centre of the world.","In general, colonists from the different parts of Greece localized themselves somewhat definitely in their new homes; yet there must naturally have been a good deal of commingling among the various families of pioneers, and, to a certain extent, a mingling also with the earlier inhabitants of the country.",Rather is it typical of its age in that it is an elaborate compilation and a critical review of the labors of Strabo's predecessors.,We have already noted the fable that his enthusiasm over this discovery led him to sacrifice a hecatomb.,"He nowhere attempts to estimate the precise size of the earth, of the moon, or of the sun, or the actual distance of one of these bodies from another.","Such as it is, however, the natural history stands to the credit of the Stagirite.",Let us take for consideration the consonantal sound represented by the letter b.,"It should be explained, however, that, with both Hipparchus and Ptolemy, the theory of epicycles would appear to have been held rather as a working hypothesis than as a certainty, so far as the actuality of the minor spheres or epicycles is concerned."
