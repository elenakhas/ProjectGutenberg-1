"Both of them had the heavy build of their mountain stock, and the garments of the free swordsman would do for Flor's purpose, even though they might not fit him perfectly.","*       *       *       *       * At length, he decided the time was right to talk to the Duke of more serious things.","He must have words, he decided, with Bel Menstal.","The merchant barge swept through the rapids just beyond Menstal, her polemen deftly preventing disaster against the rocks.",But we don't go around scaring transvisors.,The Duke sighed wearily.,"""Search this man.""",But he seemed to be condemned in advance.,"He guided his mount through the narrow streets to the castle gate, where he confronted a sleepy, heavily-armed sentry.","When the barge had cleared, serfs inside the tower strained at the windlass in obedience to the commands of their overseer, and the chain rose jerkily, to regain its former position across the stream.","""None of them knew a thing,"" he snarled.","As I said, visibility refraction doesn't work right in their case.",He reached into the case.,*       *       *       *       * The great market square at Orieano was crowded.,"I don't know.""","""You ran into a transvisor, I'm afraid.","The team chief laughed shortly, bringing the flat of his blade down in a resounding smack and Flor straightened, involuntarily bringing a hand to his outraged rear.","And, of course, he was invited to join the hunts.","The merchant shook his head dazedly, but offered no word of protest.","""Here, weakling.",Derikuna smiled sardonically.,"""You were lucky to get away.","""Simple enough.""",He snapped his lingers and a page hurried forward.,He folded his hands and bowed his head submissively.,"Merchants and their assistants hovered about, each endeavoring to outdo the rest in enticing the swarming crowd into his tent.","""Yes, Excellency.""",Konar shrugged.,"I have funds, adequate to garrison the tower of the Menstal, and even to make it livable for a considerable force of men.",And memory crowded upon him.,"He started sliding down an endless, dark chute, ending in impenetrable blackness.","Others simply strode about, still looking for the things they had come to seek out.","At last, he kicked the nearest bale.",They would simply expose him and accuse him before the Duke.,"He raised his hands, palms together, and looked up pleadingly.","""You would dispute my judgment?""",The forest was somehow more clear to him than it had ever been.,"Next month, at the fair, he would press suit for the hand of the heiress, and a few months after that he would have control of the rich farm lands and the trading city.","He could be struck with the sword, and perhaps in the confusion, an escape would be possible.","The small hand weapon he carried would render the obsolete body shield ineffective, if necessary, and a light charge would assure that the man wouldn't awaken.","The page returned, bearing a large cup and a flagon of wine.","""That awful thing!","The steward reached into the chest, removing bags which clinked as they were dropped to the table.","His hand, holding the short club above the Earl's throat, trembled uncontrollably.","That'll pick up any power radiation from the castle.""","""There is a further bit of evidence I might offer,"" he added.",Florel came upon the Duke while he was considering the news of one of these raids.,"Possibly, she was of eastern descent, Konar thought.","""What an overload!",Gerda drew himself up into a commanding pose.,"It would be the work of a few minutes to remove the equipment the man had, to substitute the purely ornamental insignia, and to sweep out of the room, closing the window after him.","During the days and nights that followed, he exerted himself to gain the favor of the Duke and his household.","Almost always, there has been the cry, 'It's witchcraft!'",He stepped back.,The haze about him scintillated and became impenetrable darkness.,"""And there is no chance that any of your men could have hidden anything on the way here?""","But what's going on?""",The castle steward came toward them.,"""Old Marnio sees you like that,"" he muttered warningly, ""makes lashes.""",But I had nothing to do with it myself.,Who expected one of these roving soldiers of fortune to be dressed in the height of style?,He looked at the stone buildings of the town and its castle.,"""Cattle,"" he growled, ""to think they could cheat the Baron Bel Menstal of his just tax.""","Before him was a dish of good cakes, beside him, a cup and flagon of good wine.","As the boat's keel grated against gravel, he shook his head and stepped forward.","Taking up the sword, he replaced it in its scabbard and swaggered through the forest, imitating the man-at-arms' song.",More small blocks of wood fell out.,"""Yes, sir?""","Of course, he had far to come, and the way through the mountains could be difficult.","""Pretty nasty clip, wasn't it, sir?""",He looked at Konar.,"Here is one thing we can produce well in these mountains.""","Ah, well, perhaps it would be as well to allow him to finish his life in peaceful possession of his broad fields.",Flor looked savagely at his captive.,"Sitting with his back to a small tree, he closed his eyes and folded his thick arms over his head.","Flor watched as his prisoner started to disrobe, then pulled off his own single garment, carefully guiding it through the belt at his waist, so as not to disturb the talisman's powers.","He continued at the head of his retinue, through the center of the square.","We have stripped them, but they have no unusual things about them.",Don't give her any cause for fear.,"Unquestionably, these were genuine men of the west.","She could become Lady Death, if she got frightened.","He'll be drowsing inside, where it's warm.","""Oh, to be sure."""
