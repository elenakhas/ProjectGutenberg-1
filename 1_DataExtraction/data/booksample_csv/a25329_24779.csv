"""Surely, you don't think I'd be so foolish as to tamper with the Baron's taxes?","Unquestionably, these were genuine men of the west.",The beauteous damsel of Orieano would be a simple task.,"He stepped back out for a moment, to watch the merchant barge enter the rapids beyond the chain.","He examined the belt, noting the long metal case, with its engraving and its bosses.",He turned and struck a gong.,"This, Bel Menstal thought, must be checked.","Now, we'll see whether he's the guy we've been looking for, the guy with our equipment.""","He chose three small scraps of wood, scrawled tally marks on them, and went over to a heavy chest.","""Six thousand teloa, Your Honor.","Bel Menstal, protected by his body shield, brushed the stroke aside.","He looked around, deciding that the Earl's living quarters would be in the wooden building at the head of the inner courtyard.",He smiled to himself.,"The caravan clattered through the gate beneath the castle, twisted through the streets just beyond the wall, and stopped in the market place.","""Good thing I've got my body shield modulated for full refraction,"" he told himself.",*       *       *       *       * Baron Bel Orieano looked worried.,We want to know what abnormal or unusual developments have taken place in what country in the last twenty years.,"The Duke nodded, satisfied.",Lor spread his hands.,"""Hold still, sir,"" he instructed.","He touched the controls of his body shield to raise himself a few inches above the cobblestones, and floated between the two sentries, going slowly to avoid making a breeze.","He looked over at the thicket into which the little animal which had started the charger, was hiding.",He reached into the case.,"My barony has been a peaceful community, having little need for arms.""","That worked with no trouble.""",But it was a little strange he was not yet here.,"""I'm just dreaming up a nice, dirty trick,"" he admitted.","At last, satisfied with his estimate of the cargo's valuation, he turned.","We must gather the forces of the barony.""","Somehow, they pick up visual sensation right through a screen, regardless of its adjustment.","""What's your cargo value?""","""You didn't explain that part.""","It's a heavy duty job, I know.",Gerda stepped forward swiftly.,"A good one.""",Florel came upon the Duke while he was considering the news of one of these raids.,"Two guards seized the prisoner, and Konar tore the belt from the man's waist.","At last, he came back, holding the door for the leader of the castle guard detachment, who came forward to salute his superior.","Certainly, no western Earl would desert his holdings to journey to far lands and to take service with another, not even one so highly placed as yourself.""","""And how were collections?""","She could become Lady Death, if she got frightened.","He looked at the bags, then tossed them aside and looked coldly at the guard officer.","Here, his chamberlain would find the things he had been ordered to get that the comfort of the castle might be furthered.",But the old man was really dead.,"I have no knowledge of such.""","""And what are these?""","None from this land had ever been even to the mountainous backbone of his own land, he was sure.","Weron threw his arms before him, trying to ward off the blows, then slumped as the blade sank into his flesh.",The girl looked harmless enough.,Nor would they be able to deny him aught.,"The searcher made a thorough examination of Gerda's clothing, muttered to himself, and went over his search again.","But what's going on?""",Konar looked curious.,"""We are deeply indebted to you, Excellency,"" he added, turning to the Duke.","Konar smiled a little, pointing a small object as Meinora slipped his own sword out.",He set the cup down.,"""Why, I ...","Now that they're out of their force field, they'll start to sublimate.","Meinora looked at the detector set, then around at the younger man beside him.","And always there has been a more simple, worldly explanation.""","""He knew nothing.""","No more, please.""",Meinora shrugged.,He had stolen nothing.,His presence in the town had certainly been noted.,"""This, Excellency, is an unusual problem.","""Well, let's keep watch on it.""","A line of men were coming down the steep path, stepping cautiously as they wound about the sharp turns.","""They're not only violent themselves, but they expect violence from others.","""The Duke has sent couriers,"" he said, ""to gather the fighting men of the duchy.","Seven barges came through during the night, with good cargoes.""","""Yes, Excellency, I----"" ""Inept fool!",Florel smiled.,She turned to point at the flower-bordered patch of berry bushes at the other end of the court.,He knew what fear could do.,"One incident stood out--a time when the old man, having overindulged in the local wine, had demonstrated his ability to divine the thoughts of others.",That coronet he always wore beneath his steel cap had served him well.,An iron hat--_deri kuna_.,The forest was somehow more clear to him than it had ever been.,He looked uneasily at the two guards who flanked him.,"Here, he could take service with the Duke as a young man of noble blood, once afflicted with a restless urge for travel, but now ready to establish himself.",It had not been for nothing that he had carefully studied the ways of the nobility.,"With a sob of effort, Flor dashed his club downward, as though striking a _husa_."
