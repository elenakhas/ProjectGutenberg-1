It'll change our whole primary plan.,"The merchant shook his head dazedly, but offered no word of protest.",Gerda handed the bags to his clerk.,"""Good thing Ciernar and I backed you up a little.","This boy never had any instruction.""","Here, they would learn to respect him, too.",It might be suicide.,He faced Bel Menstal.,"He stopped, to look into the chest with a puzzled expression on his face.","Flor, he thought, could be part of a name.","""Yes, sir.","""Hey, what's the matter, youngster?","""With the power he's using,"" Meinora remarked, ""it's a wonder he doesn't upset every mind in his castle.""","It had been pure chance, he knew, that they had noticed this bit of equipment.","""But you still insist you had nothing to do with the disappearance of this money?""","He tried to get away with a tenth, then protested the valuation.","""Look, call Barskor.","For an instant, his fingers played with the ornamental bosses.","He got out of his chair and circled the table, striding close to the steward.","Seven barges came through during the night, with good cargoes.""","Her eyes fluttered weakly, and she struggled to regain her feet.","Knights have occupied the heights, protecting the border for a time, to be sure, but the land has always escheated to the duchy.","Then, the floor came at him with blinding speed and he ceased to wonder.","It covered the coronet, effectively hiding it.","""That awful thing!",Meinora spread his hands.,"*       *       *       *       * From somewhere atop the cliff, a bell tolled.",His hand sought his sword hilt.,Flor snatched his sword from its sheath.,"The eastern continent may be loaded with 'em.""","The scream reverberated through his brain, rising in an intolerable crescendo, blotting out other sensory perception.","He looked at the tiny castle far below, noticing that from his altitude, it looked like some child's toy, set on a sand hill, with bits of moss strewed about to make a realistic picture.","Here and there, a cutpurse slunk through the crowd, seeking his own type of bargain--an unwary victim.","""They're rather rare.","""It will be,"" he stated positively.","""That's right.","After that, it would be a simple, practiced routine.",He paused.,"He would assume his talismans had simply lost their powers due to some occult reason, as many others had during recent times.","I don't care how you do it, and I'm not going to be bothered with your petty details.","""Draw up your guard,"" he ordered.","Now, he wished to get to the castle of Orieano, where he would take refreshment after his trip.","Now, he was engaged in earnest conversation with Orieano.","Then, he bowed respectfully.",He smiled grimly to himself as he remembered the last robber attack.,"""Yes, it seems to be about right.",*       *       *       *       * The page reappeared with a flagon of wine and some cakes.,"The Baron waved a hand impatiently, then adjusted his golden coronet to a more comfortable angle.","I wish to pay him my respects, and those of my father, the Earl of Konewar.""","""Yes, Excellency.""","This insignia is but the outward symbol of that superiority.""","But certainly, the son of Dwerostel would have no word in the control of the duchy.","It was still there, and he could feel a sense of fearful wonder, a desire to be gone, coupled with a fear of being discovered.","A sudden, sharp pain tore at Gerda's throat, and blinding light seemed to strike back of his eyes.","""Nobles,"" was the reply, ""do not fight with serfs.","""Possibly a small tax?""","In so doing, she faced directly toward Konar.",But I am here.,"Bring refreshment, at once.""","The east coast earldom was known, of course, but somehow, searchers had failed to discover that the Earl held any equipment.","Startled by the noise, a _husa_, which had been hiding beneath a nearby bush, raced into the open.","""We shall make note of your name, Merchant.",Serfs belonged on the land--part of it!,"""Including his own.""",Konar looked curious.,"""He claims to be a younger son of the Earl of Konewar.","""It would be pleasing to us,"" he said.","Usually, I have discovered the errant one--with the help of my guards, of course.","But on other occasions, the Earl had been so engrossed in explaining the device as to neglect the presence of the eavesdropper.",Konar glanced at the panel again.,"Makes you uncomfortable.""",The Duke listened contentedly.,"Now, we'll have to slog it out the hard way.","Is this true?""","""You would try it?""","You see, they're beings with a completely wild talent.",He put the coronet on his head and shuddered a little as the awareness increased to an almost painful intensity.,He had caught the semi-fearful thoughts.,"""Have you found anything yet?""","Neither do several of the other team chiefs.""","The castle guard, he gathered, was a little less than perfectly alert.","""This may become a matter for the Baron's personal attention,"" continued the steward.","Sometimes, he took service with a captain, who would engage in a campaign."
