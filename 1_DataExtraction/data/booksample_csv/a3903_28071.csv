"It seemed a rather large hall, and I caught a momentary glimpse of bare rafters and plasterless wall.","""I said that any such oath taken without foreknowledge of the crime could not have contemplated such an event, and that however wrong the taking of such an oath might have been in itself, to assist in concealing such a crime as this murder was infinitely worse--infinitely worse than taking the oath, and infinitely worse than breaking it.","Supposing such a case in this matter of Mr. Telfer, it would only be necessary for Mayes to meet him in the corridor, repeat his formula and command the victim to bring out the paper he specified.",There was one ventilator only in the small room.,"Don't be very long, now.""",Then I left the policemen with their prisoner and made for the nearest cab-rank.,"""I haven't heard a word,"" he said.",Hewitt shook his head.,"""A black leather case, eh!","Some expedients are being attempted, of course, but you will understand that any new code would have to be arranged with scattered items of the fleet in all parts of the world, and that probably with the present code in the hands of the enemy.","""No signs of a struggle,"" commented Plummer, ""and there was no noise, they say.",I shall go there first.,I can't say it strongly enough--he never would!,But why should such an apparently unimportant thing as that be carefully brought from the waste-paper basket and burnt?,"""'It certainly seems so,' I said.","I was first at the meeting-place--indeed, a little before my time.","And so the telegram went to Plummer, and Hewitt, accepting the rector's invitation to an early dinner before starting on their visit, resigned himself to wait.","Mayes probably thought that a notable example like this, so boldly displayed and so conspicuously reported in the Press, would impress his auxiliaries throughout London with the terror that was one of his weapons; for they would well understand the meaning of the Red Triangle, and they would receive a striking illustration of the consequences of rebellion or bad faith.",And there will be more than Myatt to take--he was not alone!,"""You have done your best, now I must do mine.","""But why,"" asked the astonished rector, ""why did he come back?""","Mr. Hewitt, when I went away without warning on Thursday night I was dogging Mayes!""","When I come to examine the comparative frequency of the different letters, I find them much as they might be expected to be in a sentence of normal English, and any change would destroy the proportion.","""They have put out the light, it seems,"" Hewitt said.","The passenger in the fly, a thin, dark, elderly man, leaned over the side to look ahead at us, and with that the policeman pulled up with a great gasp and staggered into the ditch.","But when you sent for me, no doubt you had some definite idea or intention in your mind.",I can't think what's wrong with poor uncle!,"""Never, unless they are sent for.""","I read the moves downward--_i_ to _w_, _e_ and _h_, and found that led to nothing.","When he first came out with you I recognised him at once as a man I had seen at that same door a little after two o'clock--say a quarter past.""","There are few boots, and those not much worn, although he was living in the country.","The keys on the bunch I took in my pocket, of course, and the room door key I also took.","From first to last his eyes had never ceased to search me, and now as I descended the stairs I could _feel_ that they were fixed on me still.","You had best be putting on older things while I get into newer.""","And it was inflicted with a razor, Henning's own, as was very clearly proved after inquiry.",replied Hewitt.,Now why should he do that?,"At a quarter-past two--that was about it, I think?""","What next?""","Well, that assistant was a very intelligent man of mine, named Corder--a fellow with a wonderful memory for a face.","The house on which our eyes were fixed was a little too far up the street for us to see perfectly through the window of the second-floor, though we could see enough to indicate that it was furnished as an office.","Off to the right from where we stood the village roofs were visible, giving indication of the position of the road to Redfield.","Ground-floor, Stevens, packing-case maker; first-floor, Hutt, agent in fancy-goods; second-floor, dunno.","""Not my lock!""","""That is Mayes, and no other,"" said Plummer, when I had made my report and described the man with the eyes.","He pointed out quite clearly the path by which his master had gone on his last walk; showed us the gate, still fastened, over which he had climbed to gain the adjoining meadow, and put us in the way of finding the small wood and the barn.","It was terror, Mr. Potswood--sheer, sick terror!","""Hardly.","More, you must remember that the body has not been seen by either of Peytral's relatives.""","You don't happen to have any more, do you?""","Well, then there's the top-floor--but I s'pose it's the same tenant.","That is why I sent for you; for that, and because I thought it might be advisable to keep the matter quiet, till you had taken some steps.""","""Very well, Miss Peytral, I will first go and look at some things I must see, and I will do without your mother's help as long as I possibly can.","The box indicated was one of ordinary thin sheet iron, japanned black--something like what is called a deed box.","There is the other crime, too!","But a consultation of the railway guide showed that trains to Throckham were fewer than one might suppose, considering the proximity of the village to London, and that the next would leave in about an hour and a quarter; so that I saw Hewitt before he started.","The man is one who knows all the geography of Channel Marsh, and he also knows exactly where to find the boat I used to-day.","""Excuse my rushing in like this,"" he said, ""but your lad told me that it was Mr. Brett who was with you, and the matter needs hurry.","There was a moment's pause, a sound of movement from the upper part of the ruin, another quiet moment, and then a bang and a flash from high on the wall to the right.","Martin Hewitt, however, had his plans, as he was soon to show.","Then we get this.""","The cashier took it, turned it over, and shifted mechanically to post the amount in the book on his desk.","Is that the fact?""",can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.,"But as it seemed that the risk was to be chiefly Mason's, and as Mason knew all of which both he and the rector were ignorant, Mason must be allowed to choose his own time.","With scarcely a preliminary word he burst out, 'Have you seen this in the paper?","But the cypher has told me something, as I will explain presently.""","Martin Hewitt nodded, with a jerk of the hand toward the padlock.","Though as to the latter, I repeated that any such engagement made without contemplation or foreknowledge of such a crime would seem to be void in that respect.",I think at least that it gives us another conjecture.,"""Nothing more; but it was something, you see.","Why, if any person wished to send a note and a key in a closed envelope, should he take the trouble to pack the note inside the key?","""There's Mason's gardener!""","And after I had called him 'doctor,' too!""","We'll get him out of the mess as soon as possible.""","And the triangle was suggestive, too.""",At once I thought of Denson's disappearance unobserved by the housekeeper.,"That was eighty miles away and more, across swamps, and forests and mountains.","Besides,"" McCarthy added, dropping into a seat before his desk, ""if he's got any friends they'll come, sooner or later, when they miss him.","So I'm with you, Plummer, if you'll allow it; and you can make your official application for a special retainer or not, just as you please.""","You've bin a stranger lately.""","Now let us see the dummies.""",The next stile led to Penn's Meadow.
