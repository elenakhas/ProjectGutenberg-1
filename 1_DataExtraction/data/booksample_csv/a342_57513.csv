[83] X.—SYMPATHETIC MAGIC.,"IS it for that in old time it was not held honest and lawfull for children to do off their clothes before their fathers; nor the sonne in law in the presence of his wives father; neither used they the stouph or bath together: now is _Jupiter_ reputed the priests or _Flamines_ father: and that which is done in the open aire, seemeth especially to be in the verie eie and sight of _Jupiter_?","Q._ 68, drove out the evil spirits of disease, sterility, &c., by the blows from their scourges.","At Rome, we find from Festus,[115] the bride was also sprinkled with water.","Howbeit, when _Livius Drusus_ was departed this life, his companion in office _Aemylius Scaurus_, would not give over and renounce his place, untill such time as certeine Tribunes of the people, for his contumacie commanded, that he should be had away to prison.","IS it for the same cause, that as in some cities of _Greece_, the sacerdotall dignitie was equivalent to the royall majestie of a king, so they would not chuse for their priests, meane persons and such as came next to hand.","The period of this fluctuation in usage may be assumed to have been long enough to allow of the requisite diversity of gentile names, while the fact that the number of _gentes_ is always fixed, however far back they can be historically traced, shows that the fluctuation at last hardened into unyielding custom.","It is worth while to note that at different times a man might belong to four different joint undivided families: he might be born into a family which still united in worshipping the spirit of his great-grandfather: and thus his cousins, his first cousins once removed, and his second cousins once removed, would dwell in the same household with him.","[83] ""Make of it an image in his likeness (_i.e._, of Namtar, the plague);       apply (the image) to the living flesh of his body (_i.e._, of the       sick man).","Hence a continual tendency to extend the family name, and to enlarge the number of prohibited degrees.","Or rather, was it not for some other secret advertisment, to teach us not to violate or kill any thing whatsoever that hath life, if it hurt not us first; as if fire were a living creature: for need it hath of nourishment and moveth of it selfe: and if a man doe squench it, surely it uttereth a kinde of voice and scricke, as if a man killed it.",_Ianus_.,"The reasonable course for them to pursue, therefore, is to treat him as though he were a ghost: if he is no ghost, it will do him no harm; if he is, they will have protected themselves.",Roman antiquaries explained the practice as due to fear lest the worshipper should see anything of evil omen during his prayer.,"_What is the cause that upon the thirteenth day of December, which in   Latine they call the_ Ides _of December, there is exhibited a game of   chariots running for the prize, and the horse drawing on the right hand   that winneth the victorie, is sacrificed and consecrated unto_ Mars, _and   at the time thereof, there comes one behinde, that cutteth off his taile,   which he carrieth immediatly into the temple called_ Regia, _and   therewith imbrueth the altar with blood: and for the head of the said   horse, one troupe there is comming out of the street called_ Via sacra,   _and another from that which they name_ Suburra, _who encounter and trie   out by fight who shall have it_?","And as I suppose this _Carmenta_ was the mother of _Evander_, who came with him into _Italy_; whose right name indeed was _Themis_, or as some say _Nicostrata_: now for that she rendred propheticall answeres and oracles in verse, the Latins surnamed her _Carmenta_: for verses in their tongue they call _Carmina_.",25; Aur.,"The exceptions may be real, or they may be due to faulty observation; they may be of the highest importance, as being the sole indications of a prior and very different form of family life, or they may be merely local, transient departures from the normal patriarchal form, and so be insignificant or deceptive; but in any case, they are relatively so few as to leave it a practically true statement to say that the patriarchal family has been normal among the Aryans in historic times.","for in truth they have no ushers or vergers to carie before them the knitches of rods, which are the ensignes of magistracie; neither sit they in the chaire of estate called _Sella curulis_, to determine causes judicially, or give audience unto the people; nor enter into the administration of their office at the beginning of the yeere, as all other magistrates doe: neither are they put downe and deposed after the election of a Dictatour: but whereas the full power and authoritie of all other magistrates of State, he transferred from them upon himselfe: the Tribunes onely of the people continue still, and surcease not to execute their function, as having another place and degree by themselves in the common-weale: and like as some oratours and lawiers doe hold, that exception in law is no action, considering it doth cleane contrary to action; for that action intendeth, commenseth, and beginneth a processe or sute; but exception or inhibition, dissolveth, undooeth, and abolisheth the same: semblably, they thinke also, that the Tribunate was an empeachment, inhibition, and restraint of a magistracie, rather than a magistracie it selfe: for all the authority and power of the Tribune, lay in opposing himselfe, and eroding the jurisdiction of other magistrates, and in diminishing or repressing their excessive and licentious power.","For this seemeth to be verie absurd, that   they themselves should do those things, which they reprooved in others as   damnable._ MAY it not be that they judged it an execrable superstition, to sacrifice a man or woman unto the gods, marie unto divels they held it necessarie?","_Why begin the Romans their yeere at the moneth Januarie?_ FOR in old time the moneth of March was reckoned first, as a man may collect by many other conjectures, and by this specially, that the fift moneth in order after March was called _Quintilis_, and the sixt moneth _Sextilis_, and all the rest consequently one after another until you come to the last, which they named December, because it was the tenth in number after March: which giveth occasion unto some for to thinke & say, that the Romans (in those daies) determined and accomplished their compleat yeere, not in twelve moneths but in ten: namely, by adding unto everie one of those ten moneths certain daies over and above thirtie.",viii.,"When the Italians learnt that Hera was the goddess under whose protection the Greek women were, they naturally thought of the Juno who was the guardian-spirit of each Italian woman, and applied to Juno the cult and myths that belonged to Hera.","The source of this difficulty plainly is the assumption that the original ancestor of the tribe had a family name, which was inherited by all his descendants.",9;       Serv.,"A devotion to the principle of agnation so strong as to over-ride the innate Aryan aversion to endogamous marriages, so strong even in the days of civilised Athens as to afford the Orestes of Æschylus with the defence that the mother whom he had killed was not of his blood, cannot be explained as a survival from times when kinship was counted exclusively through the female line.","for it seemeth that this was the cause, why _Romulus_ killed his owne brother _Remus_, for that he presumed to leape over an holy and inviolable place: whereas contrariwise, it was not possible to consecrate and hallow the gates, thorow which there must needs be transported many things necessary, and namely, the bodies of the dead.","But if it be so as _Labeo_ saith, that this word _Hora_ is rightly derived of the Greeke verbe ὁρμᾶν or παρορμᾶν, which signifieth to incite or provoke; consider better, whether this word _Orator_ also, that is to say, one who stirrith up, exhorteth, encourageth, and adviseth the people, as a prompt and ready counseller, be not derived likewise in the same sort, and not of ἀρα or εὐχὴ, that is to say, praier and supplication, as some would have it.","But the feast of the Larentalia (or Larentinalia), to which Plutarch alludes in _R.","A tribe, therefore, which consists of several clans cannot consist of descendants of a common ancestor.",Op.,"_What is the reason that the Romans punish the holy Vestall Virgins (who   have suffered their bodies to be abused and defiled) by no other meanes,   than by interring them quicke under the ground?_ IS this the cause, for that the maner is to burne the bodies of them that be dead: and to burie (by the meanes of fire) their bodies who have not devoutly and religiously kept or preserved the divine fire, seemed not just nor reasonable?","6, 50.","[4] Meyer, _Indogermanische Mythen_, ii.","This ""symbol"" of the Pythagoreans is well-known.","Why were the _anchisteis_, ""the nearest relations,"" as the Greeks technically named them, so sharply distinguished from the others?","Or for that they measuring and determining the time according to the differences of the moone, they observed in her every moneth three principall changes and diversities: the first, when she is altogether hidden, namely during her conjunction with the sunne; the second when she is somewhat remooved from the beames of the sunne, & beginneth to shew herselfe croissant in the evening toward the West whereas the sunne setteth; the third, when she is at the full: now that occultation and hiding of hers in the first place, they named Calends, for that in their tongue whatsoever is secret & hidden, they say it is [_Clam_] and to hide or keepe close, they expresse by this word [_Celare_;] and the first day of the moones illumination, which wee heere in _Greece_ tearme _Noumenia_, that is to say, the new-moone, they called by a most just name _Nonæ_, for that which is new and yoong, they tearme _Novum_, in manner as wee doe νὲον.","When then we find Porphyry, in his life of Pythagoras (§ 43), saying that Pythagoras bade his followers ""abstain from beans as from human flesh,"" we may reasonably infer that beans were regarded, in the folk-lore of the day, as resembling some part of the human body, and as having a mysterious affinity with it.","I submit, therefore, that a widowed Flamen was considered in danger of sudden death, and that this danger (a danger to the community, which might thus lose the sky-spirit) consisted in the probability that the soul of the departed wife might tempt away the soul of the living Flamen.",145 _ff._) has abundantly shown that many of the symbols of Pythagoras are but maxims of folk-lore which have gathered round the name of that mysterious philosopher.,"Q._, 29), ""_would not permit the new wedded bride to passe of herself over the door-sill or threshold, when she is brought home to her husband's house, but they that accompanie her must lift her up between them from the ground, and so convey her in_.","Or because he it is that ministred libations first, that is to say, those effusions and offrings of wine that are given to the gods?","Consider moreover, whether _Numa_ chose not this moneth for to begin the yeere withall, as best sorting with nature in regard of us; for otherwise in generall, there is no one thing of all those that by nature turne about circularly, that can be said first or last, but according to the severall institutions and ordinances of men, some begin the time at this point, others at that.",Thus far our explanation is hypothetical: to verify the hypothesis it is necessary to show that the dead are or were as a matter of fact treated as the Roman custom prescribes that the _soi disant_ living man shall be treated.,"21 and 28);       but no spirit was forthcoming for gold coin, which was first struck       in B.C.",[134] 9.,130.,"On the other hand, as Plutarch informs us (_R.",7.,"We do not imagine that because some of the taboos laid on the Mikado were the same as some laid on the flamen Dialis, they were therefore borrowed.",14.,"I cannot even conjecture _what is the reason that Quintus Metellus forbad to observe auspices after the moneth Sextilis_, nor why _they thought Aruspices ought to have their lanterns and lampes alwaies open_, nor why _obsserve they the vultures most of any other fowles in taking of presages_.","Gracch._, i.",117.,"363-371 and 490-494) should also be noticed here: a maiden is given the heart of a dead man to eat, and two hours afterwards she bore a son, who could speak and run the moment he was born.","[43] Again, the Teutonic house-spirit on the one hand is admittedly a deceased ancestor, and on the other is an indubitable fairy.","Then the coffin must be carried foot foremost through the door; for if the corpse's face be turned to the house, the ghost can return.","The downward movement, therefore, from the maximum to the minimum number of prohibited degrees which is observable in historic times must have been preceded in pre-historic ages by an upward movement from the minimum to the maximum; and, as far as the evidence at present goes, though the upward movement may, in pro-ethnic times, have proceeded as far as the Remote Kin, it may equally well only have reached to the limits of the Near Kin; while, after the Aryan dispersion, the movement may have continued upwards amongst the Hindoos, downwards amongst the Athenians, and, for a long time, have ceased to move in any direction amongst the conservative Romans.","[30] Hard, however, as Plutarch's question appears at first sight, it may by the aid of modern folk-lore and savage custom be explained.",53.,The folk-explanation treated it as a symbol commemorative of the expulsion of the Tarquinii.,"As a matter of fact, even in the _Roman Questions_, without going further, we have indications that both practices were known in Italy.",See _R.,Frazer.,"""Turmeric has a brilliant yellow colour, which indicates that it has the power of curing jaundice;

considering that they had their elders to oversee them, yea, and to controll their demeanour: and in this regard haply also, that their fathers themselves should in their carriage be more sober, honest, and frugall, in the presence of their children: for looke where old folke are shamelesse, there it can not chuse but (as _Plato_ saith) children and youth will be most gracelesse and impudent.","Or is it not, for that the man who hath the superintendence of treaties of peace, and of othes, ought to see as _Homer_ saith, ἅμα πρόσω και ἐπίσω, that is to say, before and behind.","Moreover, for refreshing the colour of those images and statues, it is a necessarie piece of worke;
