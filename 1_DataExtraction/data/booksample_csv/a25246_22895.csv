"""That is hardly the spirit which has led science to its great achievements, Dixon,"" he observed amiably.","But this time you will be prepared, and the effect will be much less.""","Now the question is, where would we put it, since all the space we have is already occupied by space?","There was a light in the window of his laboratory over in the Physics Building, so I dropped in, making my way past the desk where Carter labored, and the corner where Miss Fitch sat in dull primness at her endless task of transcribing lecture notes.","She's glorious, and Fitch is plain and scrawny and ugly.","""It depends on how you look at it,"" I responded glumly.","What she said to van Manderpootz was in tones too low for me to hear, and apparently too low for Carter's ears as well, else I should have heard her words through the attitudinizor.","""Very simply.","""A second time will not only be easier, but also impossible,"" I said crossly.","What do you think?""",It was with an effort that I untangled myself from the web of fascination enough to catch Carter's thought of her name.,"Shaking his finger, the professor recited oracularly, ""'Oh, wad some pow'r the giftie gie us to see oursel's as ithers see us.'",There was the solution!,"""But no one can ever really understand another person's point of view,"" I said.",Of course it's all in the point of view.,"So, after a puzzled but admiring survey of its infinitely delicate wires and grids and lenses, I made the obvious move.",Ouch!,Thus he could apprehend my conception of van Manderpootz's reaction to the color red.,And shapes!,"""I don't care how the dictionary pronounces the word!""",I put it on.,"""And is it also true that you chose to investigate the viewpoint of Carter out there?""","That was my first impression, for the world was a dull panorama of greys and whites and blacks.","""O-o-o-h!""","For a few moments I watched her through Carter's eyes, but as she neared the laboratory door, he turned his attention again to van Manderpootz, and she was lost to my view.","His attention was completely taken up by the voice of van Manderpootz, who had passed from a personal appraisal of Carter's stupidity to a general lecture on the fallacies of the unified field theory as presented by his rivals Corveille and Shrimski.",He looked blankly at me.,I scarcely know how to describe the sensation of looking at the world through the filter of another's mind.,"The eyes of van Manderpootz, or perhaps his brain, interpreted color in a fashion utterly alien to the way in which my own functioned, and the resultant spectrum was so bizarre that there is simply no way of describing any single tint in words.",But which?,"""Suppose you describe the nature of the insults, and if possible, something about the workings of the attitudinizor as well.","""It's ready,"" he announced impressively.","""After all,"" I said consolingly, ""you must remember that the achievements of van Manderpootz are such as to attract the attention of the intelligent few rather than of the many.""","""If you wish to drop over to my quarters, we'll proceed to the laboratory and try it out.","One flashes the beam of this light on the subject whose point of view is desired; the visible light is reflected back with a certain accompaniment of psychons, which are here intensified to a degree which will permit them to be, so to speak, appreciated?""","*       *       *       *       * It was a week or ten days later that I happened to be passing the University on my way from somewhere to somewhere else, and I fell to wondering whether the professor had yet forgiven me.","I didn't answer; what I saw was, for the moment, quite indescribable.","But perhaps the most astonishing thing, though I did not think of it until later, was that the compound eye of the insect, did not convey to it the impression of a vast number of separate pictures, such as the eye produces when a microphotograph is taken through it.","Van Manderpootz is that power, Dixon.",You're mad!,"I perceived Carter's opinion of himself, and his self-picture was an even more mouselike portrayal than my own impression of him.","What does it do?""","She was glorious, magnificent, indescribable.","And that,"" he continued abstractedly, ""leads to certain interesting speculations.",Suddenly an echo of a long-forgotten psychology course recurred to me.,He sighed.,"""Who is she?""","Thus the thoughts of even the simplest mind can suggest to the man of genius his sublime conceptions, as is evident from the fact that I got this idea from you.""",Imbecile!,I picked up the device and fell to examining its construction.,"Haven't _you_ tried it out yet?""","One man is happy with little, another is miserable with much.","And in the second place, I have asked myself whether it is fair to the world for van Manderpootz to be the first to try out a new and possibly untrustworthy device, and I reply, 'No!'""",said van Manderpootz triumphantly.,I propound the theory that the observer _is_ the point of view.,"""Do you know who beautiful Lisa is?","I ignored that last dig, but had a time been set, I would doubtless have been even later than usual, for it was with some misgivings that I induced myself to go at all.","It is obvious that we have no time to fit in an extra couple of hours, since all our time is already accounted for.","But all I considered at the moment was my own curiosity; I wanted to learn what sort of viewpoint could produce that strange, instantaneous flash of beauty.",And habits can be learned!,"Would you believe""--his voice lowered--""would you believe that only seven and four-tenths percent are even aware of the _existence_ of van Manderpootz?","Well, everytime I try out any of your inventions I find myself in some kind of trouble.",he roared.,Attitudes are habits.,"Van Manderpootz stared curiously at me; then little by little a shrewd suspicion seemed to dawn in his broad, intelligent features.","Therefore there are as many worlds as there are points of view.""",It is equally obvious that a strictly religious man occupies a different world than that of a materialist.,"For some moments I saw nothing other than I had been seeing right along from my own personal point of view, because, as van Manderpootz explained later, the psychons from the miserable brain of a fly are too few to produce any but the vaguest of impressions.","Suppose I were to convert, say, a ton of material protons and electrons into spations--that is, convert matter into space.","And there was Miss Fitch; I confess that she had always seemed unattractive to me, but my impression of her was Venus herself beside that of the professor!","Calm, that is, for about three minutes.","And as I saw the professor close his dissertation and approach me, I slipped the attitudinizor from my head and forced myself to a measure of calm.","I was fascinated, I could do nothing but watch, and I felt a wild surge of jealousy as I caught the adoration in the attitude of the humble Carter.","""So we come now to my attitudinizor.","When I had fallen in love with my own ideal--well, at least she was _mine_, even if I couldn't have her.","I tore the attitudinizor from my head and tossed it to the table, feeling suddenly a little foolish at the sight of the grin on the face of the professor.",In love with a point of view!,"I'd be a fool to go around looking for more difficulty, wouldn't I?""","After a few moments I was able to give my full attention to the phenomena of the attitudinizor, and queer phenomena they were, too.","""But you were just talking to her!","For once I learned to do that, I could see in Lisa Fitch the very things he saw, and the vision would become reality to me as well as to him.","And doubtless many of the few that are, come from among the students in the neighborhood.","""Look here,"" proceeded van Manderpootz."
