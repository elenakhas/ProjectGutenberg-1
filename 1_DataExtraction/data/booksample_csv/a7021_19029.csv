"She knew what Lur meant, the suit which had protected her in the underworld was impervious to everything outside its surface--or to every substance its makers knew--just as Lur's own hide made his flesh impenetrable.",From the sun there shot an orange-red beam to strike full upon the metal.,"There are two paths before you--.""","Varta's eyes followed its drift and so were guided to what she had forgotten, the worlds of Asti.","Perhaps He has some use for us and it!""","Lur's instinct was right, as it ever was.","There was a grating, as from metal long unused, and a block fell back, opening a narrow door to them.",He had solved the mystery of the space suit and had stripped it from the unknown.,Under her exploring hands it was firm and whole.,"Within her hood a beaded line of moisture outlined her lips, a pulse thundered on her temple.",Varta squatted back on her heels and began to look at the water and then at the banks with more care.,"""Did the turbi blossom fade when pulled out?""","But long, and long, and long ago there was a pact made with us in His Name.","Before she stepped within, the priestess lifted her hand above her head and when she withdrew it, the sun and planets remained to form a diadem just above the intricate braiding of her dull red hair.","She held the sun on a line with one of the wrist bonds, She must avoid the flesh it imprisoned, for Asti's power could kill.","This is indeed a mystery!""","It is the scent of them which you catch--"" ""No.","The eyes of that which stood within the suit were closed, as if in sleep, but there was a warm, healthy tint to the bronze skin, so different in shade to her own pallid coloring.","She felt Lur press against her, forcing her back against a rock.",Did you expect a serpent?,And in a moment she too saw a dark hulk nosing through the vapor.,But below the surface of the water-- Varta's breath hissed between her teeth and Lur's head snapped around as he caught her thought.,"Then she crept forward, shuddering as the water rose about her ankles.","Pass free from us, woman of the Light.","It moved slowly, seeming to balance at each step as if travel was a painful act.",Swiftly she loosed the other hoops and restored the sun and worlds to their place over her head as the captive slumped across the threshold of his cell.,"""These forgotten people fought with fearsome weapons.""",The Guardian considered her answer gravely.,"The ledge sloped upwards, at a steep angle at first, and then more gently.","""But, Lur,"" her eyes were round with wonder, ""perhaps it is Asti's Will which brought us here to find this marvel!",But it bore steadily to the meeting of the two paths.,Men forget knowledge in time.,"""For him life begins at the very point it ended--even as it did for the turbi flowers.",By the glint of sunlight on the stone around them the day was already well advanced.,"But what made this--?""","The question was a shrill whine in her brain, her hands half arose to cover her ears-- ""I am Varta, Maiden of Asti.",But his people knew the art of such communication long before the first priest of Asti had stumbled upon their secret.,"""It is no enemy--"" But she did not need that reassurance from Lur.","But she saw a great city plunged into flaming death in an instant and felt the horror and remorse of the man at her feet because of his own part in that act, the horror and remorse which had led him to open rebellion and so to his imprisonment.",Lur was looking up too.,"The breaths were deeper-- Then the man half turned, his arm moved.","One of the small, jewel bright flying lizard creatures of the deep jungle poised and dipped to investigate more closely the worlds of Asti.",She leaned back against a rock.,"She examined the flowers closely, to all appearances they were perfect and natural.","Had Lur suggested it, or had that wild thought been hers alone?","""There is life--"" Hardly daring to believe that, she dropped down beside Lur and touched their prize.","Memphir knew not such--.""",The worlds of Asti!,"Then, as he sighted Varta and Lur, his eyes went wide.","""There is something beyond, something which once had life--"" Varta crowded up to him.",countered Lur.,Time did not exist in the underworld of Erb.,"""What if we carry him out only to have--to have--"" Her mind shuddered away from the picture which followed.","Half remembering old tales, she put her hands on the arch of the lower ribs and began to aid that rhythm.","""Where do they lead, Guardian of the Dark?""","""Asti!""",But now they had to fight their way through jungle and it was hard--until they reached a ridge of rock running out from the mountain as a tongue thrust into the blasted valley.,Only this ship was so old--so very old!,"""It cooks the flesh, we can not walk here,"" was his verdict.","Hoops of metal locked it firmly to the wall, but the head had fallen forward so that the face plate in the helmet was hidden.","Varta shaded her eyes and tried to see the end of this, but, if there was a distant rim of green beyond, the heat distortions in the air concealed it.",Varta laid her hand upon a ruddy scrap between two rocks and it became a drift of powdery dust.,"There was water before them, a small lake of it.","They began to climb again, across slimed rock where there were evil trails of other things which lived in this haunted darkness.","Even in Memphir the lords of the last days forgot the wisdom of their earlier sages--they fell before the barbarians easily enough.""",When they pulled themselves up onto a wide ledge the talons on Varta's gloves were worn to splintered stubs and there was a bright girdle of pain about her aching body.,"And it was there, on the slope of the mountain that they found the greatest wonder of all, Lur scenting it before they sighted the remains among the stones.",Varta nodded.,"They tumbled down together, Varta's head pillowed on Lur's smooth side, and so slept as the sun and worlds of Asti whirled protectingly above them.","But she was resolute enough when she picked up the food pouch and strode forward, passing out of the robing chamber into a narrow way which was a natural fault in the rock unsmoothed by the tools of man.",Lur put out a front paw to test the slag but withdrew it instantly.,Lur padded along the scrap of shore surveying the thing.,The Guardian paused for so long that Varta dared to prompt it.,Much of what she read now was confused or so alien to Erb that it had no meaning for her.,"It is a pity he is dead--"" Varta felt a rich warm tide rising in her throat to answer that teasing half question.","If it was His Will which had brought them here, then Asti's power would wrap her round with safety.",Then the old legends were true!,"But when this rocky road ended upon the lip of a gorge, Varta hesitated, plucking at the throat latch of her hood-like helmet.","There was a hood to cover the entire head, taloned gloves for the hands, webbed, clawed coverings for the feet--as if the skin of a giant, man-like lizard had been tanned and fashioned into this suit.","""It was a machine in which men traveled,"" his thoughts arose to her.",Tugging and straining they brought him out of the broken ship into the sunlight of Erb.,Unearthly as the thing looked it had no menace.,"Pictures of another world, another solar system, began to grow more clear as the space man became more at home in the new way of communication."
