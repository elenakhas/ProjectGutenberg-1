"But, if you are only at the stage of the last-joined chorus-girl, you cannot hope to dance the _pas seul_!",be safely “seated upon the fence” for a sufficient time to be able to decide whether the debated thing is only some small passing folly of one set--or if it is really something brought by the spirit of the Age.,Is there really something indecent and immodest in it?,"Therefore, if you want really to enjoy life and count as a coveted quantity, you must rise above the general company of young, unmeaning beings of your sex, so as to make the nice young man you may fancy think of you, not as one of a batch for him to choose from, but as the only desirable creature in all the world for him to strive to obtain.","The man, although he may forgive you, will never recover from the sting and the humiliation, and you will have created a canker in his feelings for you which nothing you can ever afterward do will heal.","Every time you go out observe what women look the nicest, and what makes them achieve this effect.","I am extremely grateful that you have sent me this sketch now, when it is not too late, and we have still some months before us to alter matters.","And when you see people with a fine title or great riches commanding no prestige, you may know it is because in themselves they have failed to come up to the standard of what the best society requires.","She must not stand against the times, but be so ruled by fine taste that she cannot be drawn into any exaggeration.",So I shall have to tell it to you in plain words.,"And further to provoke my ire, although this girl in the picture is drawn in an ordinary morning skirt and boots, she wears a light-colored ribbon in her hair!",Try to eradicate the root if you have a tendency to either of its demonstrations.,"ELINOR: To think out the reason why of things, to try to see the truth in everything.",A fine task!,"I am talking of this because I have often in these letters urged you to acquire prestige through individuality, so I must explain, that you may not misunderstand me.","Your words cannot alter my basic principle, which you will find very sound, if you care to apply to it the test of common sense.",that it had only just begun!,"[Illustration: “_I wonder if you smoke, dear girl?_”] I wonder if you smoke, dear girl?","There are numbers of girls who at the end of a month of marriage have done, said, and looked things which they would have died rather than let their fiancés perceive, hear, or see, and yet who are much astonished and feel resentful and aggrieved because they begin to reap the harvest of their own actions in the fact of their husbands showing less love and respect for them.","Deportment masters and mistresses grew to be less and less in vogue, and ridicule was cast upon the rules that had been in practice for every girl entering society.",ELINOR: Not at all!,"The whole tendency (as I think I said in a former letter) of modern society is toward rowdiness and vulgarity, and if one is very young and full of spirits it is so easy to be led away into indiscretions when one sees most of one’s companions doing the same thing.","Thus, if you bore your husband in his leisure, he may stay with you for a while from a sense of duty, but he will begin to make excuses of work to curtail the moments, and he will snatch time from his real work for his pleasure elsewhere.",ELINOR: Nowhere.,I do call that hard!,"Remember you have all your lives in front of you, and that satiety is an ever-present danger.","Marriage is the aim and end of all sensible girls, because it is the meaning of life.","Most of us retrospect or anticipate, and so lose the present.” Do not retrospect--do not anticipate.","Try to be just, do not repine, admit to yourself that you have lost the first prize in the lottery of marriage, but that there is still the second to be obtained, namely, an unassailable position, your husband’s respect, perhaps the interest in possible children, the interest in your life and your place in the world.","For, remember, this particular aspect of affection called being in love is caused by the senses of both participants being exalted.","One might say the only natural “right” a woman appears to have is to become a mother, because this seems to be her obvious mission in the scheme of things.","You may say every girl does them--which may be true, but that is no proof that they are pretty or desirable habits!",It is not altogether a bad thing; it is a proof in one way of their increasing individuality; but meanwhile it does not tend toward their happiness.,"In one of my books I once wrote this maxim: “It is better to marry the life you like, because after a while the man does not matter!” It was a very cynical sentence, but unfortunately true.",But love--that exquisite essence which turned the world into Paradise--is a thing flown away.,"I hope you agree with me, Caroline?","To see a lot of--presumably--ladies lounging all over the cloth, as they lean forward eagerly to talk to their _vis-à-vis_ or the persons next them, is not an engaging sight, and only a few years ago it would have been considered as branding them as belonging to another world.","And, as he is stronger, so he will break bonds which are irksome to him more readily.","Whatever the man has done, she ought to say or do nothing which can make him feel _less respect for herself_ in return.","Try to counteract by care the inevitable effect of outdoor games upon your hands, Caroline; use creams, wear gloves when it is possible, and keep your nails nicely polished.","About every fad, every fashion, every new thing which is started, the wise woman, Caroline, reserves judgment.",While we are talking of personal habits and such things you will notice that quantities of girls are not particular about their hands in these days.,"The wise woman instantly appreciates this point, and knows that, if she gives way to her, perhaps just, reproaches, she will be adding another millstone round her own neck in a further weakening of her attraction for, and influence over, the man.","You may think, Caroline, that, considering you are only just coming out, I might be talking to you upon lighter and more frivolous subjects; but, as you are pretty and an heiress, the marriage question will crop up so very soon that I feel that now, while you will still listen to me, is my only chance to impress its importance upon you--because the lighter things are for such a little time, and marriage is for so many years!","Then let us suppose you have done so, and marry him.","Some of them are weary old maids--some have made hole-and-corner, still enduring, wretched marriages--and some have gone under and are divorced and forgotten.","You will not have committed yourself to either side by this abeyance of expressed opinion, and can (to use another political phrase!)","It may be, if you are only trying to enter it, but it is certainly not the case if you have a right to your position, and are already there.","Be extremely particular about your foot-covering, too, Caroline.","Granted this, and the poorest intelligence might then credit Him with having the best of all the attributes with which He has endowed mankind, whom he created--chief of these being common sense.","ELINOR: John, when God made man I do believe He left out one colossal quality in him--the faculty of seeing the obvious.","JOHN: But, my poor child, that would produce a universal state of brotherly love.",ELINOR: Certainly not.,"And now, Caroline dear, I must conclude, and next week, when we meet in London, I hope we shall clasp hands in mutual contentment.","Owing to the scarcity of men, as I said before, they are inclined to give themselves airs, and numbers of young women do the seeking and the hunting, while the poor youths are scared of being captured, and, when they are secured at all, it is unwillingly.",Try always and ever to keep the atmosphere between you in harmony.,"I had meant, my dear Caroline, to write to you upon the interesting subject of marriage in this letter, but before I can commence upon that, I must speak of something else, and you must promise me not to be offended at what I am going to say, since we both desire the same end--your success and welfare.","To digress a moment--I went to a party the other night, a musical party where the guests were obliged to sit still round the room quietly; and I counted no less than thirteen of the younger women with their legs crossed, which in some cases, on account of these very narrow skirts we are all wearing, caused the sights to be perfectly grotesque.","If you do, you may be certain he will only tell you the truth when he feels inclined--and one day you will find it out, and then think he is always lying.","ELINOR: Yes, I mean that.","If the lessening of your attraction for him has been engendered by the arrival of a stronger magnet on the scene, your efforts must be redoubled to replenish your own magnetic powers.","So do not let us bother over these abstract points, but accept men as they are, dear, attractive, selfish darlings!","Very deep affection can remain when all sense of “being in love” is over, but it has lost its exquisite aroma of sweetness.","Unselfishness in her should go as far as not to want always to have her own way, regardless of whom it hurts or discomforts.","But man--just man in the abstract--can have no “rights” at all, for with whom did he make a bargain?","The legitimate way is to render yourself as utterly desirable as possible, and then fate will bring you the particular needle your kind of magnet draws.","You say it is more like you than the only photograph I possess of you, taken when you were fifteen; and it is because of your assuring me of this that I cannot remain silent--for, Caroline child, I must confess it shocks and disconcerts me, and makes me feel that I must be very frank with you, if you are ever going to be able to attain that position which we both hope that you may.","Would such popularity be worth having, and what would it bring in a few years?","To please a man after marriage every attraction which lured him into the bond should be continually kept up to the mark, because there are, then, the extra foes to fight--the natural hunting instinct in man and the destroying power of satiety.","There are many girls who seem very popular and get plenty of public attention, but who behave themselves so that they are spoken of lightly by every young man.","And now, Caroline, good-night--we have finished this talk upon religion--and need not refer to it again, since I believe your intelligence is such that you have grasped my basic principle.","Games are good for the health, and pretty white fingers are pleasant to the sight.",Learn to manage these yourself.,"No one considers her;

it will not take up much of your time, and is a gracious tribute of youth to age.",And one cannot blame him.,"Then try to decide upon the grade in public opinion you would desire to occupy yourself, and what are the causes of your friends being in whatever places they are.","Remember this maxim: “A fool can win the love of a man, but it requires a woman of _resources_ to keep it”--the difficulty being much greater in a country like England, where the women are in the majority, than in another where they have to be fought for, and the men are the more numerous.","I could write pages and pages about the vagaries of fashion, and how what looks _chic_ one year may be vulgar the next, but we have not time or space for that.","People complain of being misunderstood, but it is because they themselves, unconsciously perhaps, have given the cause for misunderstanding."
