"""What will Nelson think of us?""","They then collected five other seamen, by whose assistance they succeeded at length in getting the boat afloat; for it had grounded with the falling tide.","His letters at this time breathe an angry feeling toward Troubridge, who was now become, he said, one of his lords and masters.","Sometimes he went a birds'-nesting, like a boy; and in these expeditions Mrs. Nelson always, by his expressed desire, accompanied him.","Regardless of this interdict, which, under his circumstances, it would have been an act of suicidal folly to have regarded, he anchored in the harbour; and, by the exertions of Sir James Saumarez, Captain Ball, and Captain Berry, the VANGUARD was refitted in four days; months would have been employed in refitting her in England.","Ruffo advancing without any plan, but relying upon the enemy's want of numbers, which prevented them from attempting to act upon the offensive, and ready to take advantage of any accident which might occur, approached Naples.",They have not done me justice.,"But, thank God!","Here he communicated with his old friend Collingwood; who, having been detached with a squadron, when the disappearance of the combined fleets, and of Nelson in their pursuit, was known in England, had taken his station off Cadiz.","The Prince of Esterhazy entertained him in a style of Hungarian magnificence--a hundred grenadiers, each six feet in height, constantly waiting at table.","If I were to say I was content, I should lie; but I shall endeavour to submit with all the fortitude in my power.","They thanked him ""for having, by his victory, preserved that part of Greece from the horrors of anarchy; and prayed that his exploits might accelerate the day, in which, amidst the glory and peace of thrones, the miseries of the human race would cease.""","""And what a forlorn undertaking!""",They shipped these under the charge of a supercargo.,We thank them for the officers they have placed over us.,"Sir Gilbert Elliott believed that the great body of the Corsicans were perfectly satisfied, as they had good reason to be, with the British Government, sensible of its advantages, and attached to it.","The latter is represented as a partisan of Genoa, favouring the views of the oppressors of his country by the most treasonable means.","Then shrugging up his shoulders, he repeated the words--""Leave off action?","He retired to Naples, and brought up his youngest son in the Neapolitan service.","Frustrated thus in all his hopes, after a pursuit, to which, for its extent, rapidity, and perseverance, no parallel can be produced, he judged it best to reinforce the Channel fleet with his squadron, lest the enemy, as Collingwood apprehended, should bear down upon Brest with their whole collected force.","The cot was placed on the floor, and he continued to dictate from it.","Berry was supported from the spritsail-yard, which locked in the SAN NICOLAS's main rigging.","""Close with a Frenchman,"" he used to say, ""but out manoeuvre a Russian.""","After an action of four hours he had captured an eighty-four and a seventy-four, and then thought it necessary to bring-to the squadron, for the purpose of securing their prizes.",Mr. Vansittart sailed in it; the British Cabinet still hoping to attain its end by negotiation.,"Only one of them succeeded in this attempt; and that only because she was so covered with smoke that her intention was not discovered till she had reached the rear: the others were so warmly received, that they put about, took to flight, and did not appear again in the action to its close.","Some of their crews were then examined in Nelson's cabin, where the Judge of Admiralty happened to be present.","An official account of the battle was published by Olfert Fischer, the Danish commander-in-chief in which it was asserted that our force was greatly superior; nevertheless, that two of our ships of the line had struck; that the others were so weakened, and especially Lord Nelson's own ship, as to fire only single shots for an hour before the end of the action; and that this hero himself, in the middle and very heat of the conflict, sent a flag of truce on shore, to propose a cessation of hostilities.","There was a pressing necessity for this, for the Danes, either from too much confidence in the strength of their position and the difficulty of the channel, or supposing that the wounded might be carried on shore during the action, which was found totally impracticable, or perhaps from the confusion which the attack excited, had provided no surgeons; so that, when our men boarded the captured ships, they found many of the mangled and mutilated Danes bleeding to death for want of proper assistance--a scene, of all others, the most shocking to a brave man's feelings.","La Combe St. Michel, the commissioner from the national convention, who was in the city, replied in these terms to the summons of the British admiral--""I have hot shot for your ships, and bayonets for your troops.","Satisfied with his success, which was indeed sufficiently complete, and respecting, like a brave and honourable man, the gallantry of his enemy, the Spaniard acceded to the proposal, found boats to re-embark them, their own having all been dashed to pieces in landing, and before they parted gave every man a loaf and a pint of wine.","A band of assassins was once advancing against him; he heard of their approach, went out to meet them; and, with a serene dignity which overawed them, requested them to hear him.","The fleet immediately unmoored and weighed, and at six in the evening ran through the strait between Biche and Sardinia: a passage so narrow that the ships could only pass one at a time, each following the stern-lights of its leader.","In Sardinia the same burden of misgovernment was felt; and the people, like the Sicilians, were impoverished by a government so utterly incompetent to perform its first and most essential duties that it did not protect its own coasts from the Barbary pirates.","The armament at Toulon consisted of thirteen ships of the line, seven forty-gun frigates, with twenty-four smaller vessels of war, and nearly 200 transports.","Hitherto his career had been glorious; the baneful principles of his heart had never yet passed his lips; history would have represented him as a soldier of fortune, who had faithfully served the cause in which he engaged; and whose career had been distinguished by a series of successes unexampled in modern times.","The answer arrived on the 16th: Nelson, meantime, had exchanged visits with the governor, and the most friendly intercourse had subsisted between the ships and the shore.","His indignation was excessive; and in the apprehension that he should be exposed to the anxieties of the suit and the ruinous consequences which might ensue, he exclaimed, ""This affront I did not deserve!","It would have moved you to have seen all my children, boys and girls, hanging on my neck, and crying for joy at the happy news.","Nelson then remarked that the junior flag-officers of his fleet had been omitted in this vote of thanks; and his surprise at the omission was expressed with more asperity, perhaps, than an offence so entirely and manifestly unintentional deserved; but it arose from that generous regard for the feelings as well as the interests of all who were under his command, which made him as much beloved in the fleets of Britain as he was dreaded in those of the enemy.","The brother of the emperor is just going to marry the great Something of Russia, and it is more than expected that a kingdom is to be found for him in Italy, and that the king of Naples will be sacrificed.""","His hope was that peace might soon be made, or that he should be relieved from his command, and retire to Merton, where at that distance he was planning and directing improvements.","The defeat of this armament, whatever might be its destination, was deemed by the British government an object paramount to every other; and Earl St. Vincent was directed, if he thought it necessary, to take his whole force into the Mediterranean, to relinquish, for that purpose, the blockade of the Spanish fleet, as a thing of inferior moment; but if he should deem a detachment sufficient, ""I think it almost necessary,"" said the first lord of the Admiralty in his secret instructions, ""to suggest to you the propriety of putting it under Sir Horatio Nelson.""","Upon this Nelson bore away, and prepared to set all sail; and the enemy, having saved their ship, hauled close to the wind, and opened upon him a distant and ineffectual fire.","Sorry am I to say, much to the contrary has been dispersed.""","""We will fag ourselves to death,"" said he to Lord Hood, ""before any blame shall lie at our doors.","It was soon after ascertained that they had passed the Straits of Gibraltar on the day following; and Nelson, knowing that they might already be half way to Ireland or to Jamaica, exclaimed that he was miserable.","as the word for the army; and the next day TE DEUM was sung by the archbishop in the cathedral; and the inhabitants were invited to attend the ceremony, and join in thanksgiving for the glorious entry of the French; who, it was said, being under the peculiar protection of Providence, had regenerated the Neapolitans, and were come to establish and consolidate their happiness.","However, as your present situation must be very disagreeable, I will certainly take an early opportunity of removing you, provided your conduct to your present captain be such that another may not refuse to receive you.""","Military books, plans and maps of Italy, with the different points marked upon them where former battles had been fought, sent by the directory for Buonaparte's use, were found in the convoy.","This quality, which is as much rarer than military courage as it is more valuable, and without which the soldier's bravery is often of little avail, Nelson possessed in an eminent degree.","The signal to prepare for action had been made early in the evening; and as his own anchor dropt, Nelson called out, ""I will fight them the moment I have a fair wind!""",Part of this slaughter might have been spared.,"He had therefore made the best of his situation, and chosen the strongest position which he could possibly take in an open road.",This fidelity the French and their adherents counteracted by another kind of devotion: the priests affirmed that St. Januarius had declared in favour of the revolution.,Neither party would yield upon this point; and one of the Danes hinted at the renewal of hostilities.,This appeal to the feelings of the people was made with circumstances which gave it full effect.,"He offered his services for the attack, requiring ten sail of the line and the whole of the smaller craft.","The British admiral wrote in reply:--""Lord Nelson's object in sending the flag of truce was humanity; he therefore consents that hostilities shall cease, and that the wounded Danes may be taken on shore.",More frequently his correspondence breathed a deeper strain.,Let us hope that these islands may one day be made free and independent.,"The patience with which he had watched Toulon, he spoke of, truly, as a perseverance at sea which had never been surpassed.","They were married on March 11, 1787: Prince William Henry, who had come out to the West Indies the preceding winter, being present, by his own desire, to give away the bride.","They really mind shot no more than peas.""","""June 18th,"" his diary says, ""Cape Spartel in sight, but no French fleet, nor any information about them.","I believe this ill-luck will go near to kill me; but as these are times for exertion, I must not be cast down, whatever I may feel.""","Had I not, though I own, against my inclination, been kept at Genoa, from 8000 to 10,000 men would have been taken prisoners, and, amongst the number, General de Vins himself; but by this means the pass of the Bocchetta was kept open.","They then endeavoured to procure some intelligence of the admiral and the rest of the officers, but without success.","The incessant fatigue of body, as well as mind, which Nelson had undergone during the last three days, had so exhausted him that he was earnestly urged to go to his cot; and his old servant, Allen, using that kind of authority which long and affectionate services entitled and enabled him to assume on such occasions, insisted upon his complying.","Mr. Herbert, the president of Nevis, behaved with singular generosity upon this occasion.","The convention upon this denounced him as a rebel, and set a price upon his head.","Then stating the grounds upon which he had proceeded, he added, ""At this moment of sorrow, I still feel that I have acted right.""","This course accordingly he held, but still without success.","The admiral, at the same time, made the signal for the van ships to join him.",How amply was this second-sight of glory realised!,"If I am in my grave, what are the mines of Peru to me?","During the whole five months he seldom or never quitted the ship, but carried on the duty with strict and sullen attention.","Doubtless, the British Admiral seemed to himself to be acting under a rigid sense of justice; but to all other persons it was obvious that he was influenced by an infatuated attachment--a baneful passion, which destroyed his domestic happiness, and now, in a second instance, stained ineffaceably his public character.","This month is worse than the last; the next will render the contest doubtful; and, in six months, when the Neapolitan republic will be organised, armed, and with its numerous resources called forth, the emperor will not only be defeated in Italy, but will totter on his throne at Vienna.","Whenever an officer fails to win the affections of those who are under his command, he may be assured that the fault is chiefly in himself.","Meantime he himself; with ten sail of the line, two frigates, a brig, and a schooner, made for the Gulf of Finland.","But I have done my duty, and have nothing to accuse myself of.""","The war he thought, could not be long; just enough to make him independent in pecuniary matters."
