the officer's spy-glass pronounces her a full-rigged ship, with all sail set, and coming right down to us, though in our own vicinity the calm still reigns.","But of all chamber furniture in the world, best calculated to cure a had temper, and breed a pleasant one, is the sight of a lovely wife.","""What station do you mean, sir?""",cried the Captain.,"""Only one more stitch to take,"" muttered Ringrope, creeping near the face.","These tompions slip in and out very handily, like covers to butter firkins.","The will was comprised in one solitary sentence, exclusive of the dates and signatures: ""_In case I die on the voyage, the Purser will please pay over my wages to my wife, who lives in Portsmouth, New Hampshire_.""","I shall be happy to see you all on the occasion, and also your juniors"" (alluding to the absent _Assistant Surgeons_).",CHAPTER LXXIV.,"And St. Paul, too, knew how to box the compass, my lad!","Not to speak again of the continual dampness of the decks consequent upon flooding them with salt water, when we were driving near to Cape Horn, it needs only to be mentioned that, on board of the Neversink, men known to be in consumptions gasped under the scourge of the boatswain's mate, when the Surgeon and his two attendants stood by and never interposed.","ONE REASON WHY MEN-OF-WAR'S MEN ARE, GENERALLY, SHORT-LIVED.","""To your duty, captain of the main-top!""",But are there incompetent officers in the gallant American navy?,"As I now deviously hover and lingeringly skirmish about the frontiers of this melancholy recital, a feeling of sadness comes over me that I cannot withstand.","But as for the First Lieutenant, he ought to have extra pay allowed to him, on account of his extraordinary outlays in cap fronts;
