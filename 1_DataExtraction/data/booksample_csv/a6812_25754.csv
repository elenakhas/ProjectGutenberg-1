the squeaking protests of the saddle leather, and Randerson's low voice as he coaxed the pony to greater speed.","He seemed annoyed, but spoke persuasively.","""You an' dad was a heap mistaken, then,"" he grinned as he dismounted and trailed the reins over the pony's head.","And it must be after midnight, now!""","""If I should complain to the sheriff?""",That makes them see things where there ain't anything to see.,"Jealous, mebbe--eh?""","Seven men, besides the cook--asleep under the wagon--and Randerson, were lying around the fire in positions similar to his own.","""He used to kiss me.","She had seen Pickett's movement when Randerson had momentarily turned his back to him, but she had also seen Randerson's retaliatory movement.","""Why--why,"" hesitated Ruth, ""the thing that makes you yourself--apart from every other person;

they negotiated the plain that spread between the ranchhouse and the ford where Randerson had just missed meeting Ruth that day; they went steadily over the hilly country and passed through the section of broken land where Ruth's pony had thrown her.,"Randerson, the one exception, was seated on the edge of the chuck box, its canvas cover pushed aside, one leg dangling, his elbow resting on the other.","But after he had lain there a while, he spoke aloud: ""He'll come this way, if he comes at all.""","She did not open her lips until Uncle Jepson had concluded, and then she murmured a low ""Oh!""","When he recovered he drew back out of sight, and leaning against the wall of the cabin, with a pencil and a small piece of paper taken from a note book in a pocket, he wrote.","She was over her scare now, he knew--as he was over his fears for her, and he grinned with a humor brought on by a revulsion of feeling.","And his voice sounded insincere to her--there was even no flavor of shame in them: ""I'm sorry I done what I did, ma'am.""","He turned his head from her and smiled, toward the stable, and then he laid a hand on Ruth's shoulder and spoke comfortingly.","He had gazed downward, and he did not look up at once.",And again Uncle Jepson had trouble with his pipe.,"""I ain't been thinkin' of the killin' of Pickett as murder, ma'am.","""Women is mighty uncertain critters, ain't they, Ma?""","Oh Nig, Nig, what am I goin' to do now?""","Out at the edge of the porch, Hagar shot a dreading glance around.",He grinned at Randerson suspiciously.,"It was hideous--the dread, the uncertainty, the terrible suspense, the dragging minutes.","""I'm waitin' for you to tell Masten that you don't want to manage him.""","CHAPTER XXV                            A MAN IS BORN AGAIN The meeting between Catherson and Randerson had taken the edge off Catherson's frenzy, but it had not shaken his determination."
