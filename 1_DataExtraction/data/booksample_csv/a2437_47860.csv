and he particularly reminded me that I should upon that occasion not forget to bring with me at least 150 dinars.,"Before building my fire and disposing myself to sleep, I looked at the outline of the walls and domes and graceful minarets against the last of the evening, and I revolved in my mind that thought which shall ever be mine on my departure from any town.","The witness has insolently answered “No”.’ He then turned to me and said, with a severity that thrilled me to the marrow: ‘This is a Civil Court; but remember, sir,’ and here he raised his voice in a very terrible manner, ‘I can impound documents and present all that you have said to the Lord Prosecutor.’ “‘Yes, Your Holiness,’ said I, now thoroughly at sea.","He had no sandals, for they would have impeded him on such ground; he bore an inlaid ebon staff with an ivory hand-grasp, and was occupied, when I first saw him, in shouting a new order to a distant group of diggers.","“My camels were parked, I took my place in the chief inn of the city (under the name of Ishmaïl-of-Taftah, merchant), and my first act before ordering a meal was, again, from the very bottom of my heart, to thank Allah for the return of his mercies.","None the less I awaited that decision with some interest, for, after all, nothing is certain until it is concluded.","Which our wealthier classes bear also in an immoderate degree?’ “At this phrase the exultation of the Lord Chief Treasurer knew no bounds, and he led the stream of cheering which it so richly deserved.",I told them I was bound for the shrine of a Most Holy Man whose name I gave them.,"The other is that you shall continue to use your evident talents for the furtherance of this trade, but that I shall be regarded as a sleeping partner in the same, with half the takings.",I think I may say without boasting that I possess in a singular degree those faculties which you say you lack.,I watched him narrowly in order to imitate (when I should have left his presence) those peculiar little details which mark affluence and are of such service in negotiation.,Its hospitality had not been exaggerated.,"You are the Creator, the Artist: I am but the base mercantile instrument, and I shall be proud to share in your triumph.’ As I said this I put into my eyes the expression of inspired admiration which we of the commercial world very properly assume when we are dealing with this kind of fodder.","By it there is bound to be paid to you and your heirs for ever the revenue from the Salt Tax, and the issue will lie, I think, upon whether the clause implies payment undiminished and perpetual, or whether the recent Proclamations make a gumbo-rumbo of the original.’ “‘A what?’ said I.",Pray continue.,"Could I not, oh!","It was clear that I was in the presence of a man unusually well-informed, and my conviction was confirmed when after yet another solemn pause the voice continued as though in conclusion: “‘In acquiring money there is profit, but in letting it slip there is none at all.’ “This last jewel of wisdom I immediately recalled as part of yet another collection, to wit, the Sacred Books of the Jews; and from this further example of immense erudition my estimation of the Being possessed of it arose to the clouds.","‘It will save me,’ said I, ‘the perpetual trouble of rowing across in my little skiff and also occupy my leisure; for I am something of an engineer.’ “In truth very little engineering was required.","I admire you, my dear boy, I perceive your singular gifts.","You, as I am now convinced, know how to sell and to buy, and have all the qualities for discovering the dearest and the cheapest markets.",“Was it not strange for a man of my temperament to remain thus pottering with a few boats and leaving sacks full of coin unused?,We do not attempt the impossible or tear up the ancient framework of our State.,I avoided the main gate (which I had now passed twice and where I might be too well known) and entered the city by a little postern.,Every man rose to his feet.,“Great men have a sort of simplicity in their dealings.,"“For just as when you come to a new city of a morning, before you enter it, and after having prayed God, you should muse within yourself what sums of money you may hope to lift from its inhabitants; so when you leave any city at evening, never omit (after due thanks to your Creator!)",“Stop!” said the merchant testily.,‘An excellent case!...,I will not even swear that the value of the opportunity was lost on me.,He walked feverishly up and down.,"Price leapt upward, and as I was the author of the rumour I was also the first to take advantage of the rise in price.",I did not put this million which I had acquired aside.,There is no cause for such a bother.,"I had (for the moment at least) wearied of getting the better of others--which should be the chief activity of a man; I was already toying with such fripperies as the reading of books, the contemplation of fine manuscripts, the designing of a house for myself, the planning of gardens, futile conversation with the learned, and, worst of all, the taking of an interest in the past.","But I have a good heart, and at last I began to wink at the use of the bridge by more than these.","For a man who not only builds for a city a fine bridge but also, from a pure public spirit, leaves it open and free to all, is worthy of very high reward indeed at the hands of the Commonwealth.","His eloquence was sober, his speeches with praise of Izmat and quotations from the Sacred Books, as also with known jests--things which this practical people infinitely preferred to empty theories of the Mainland.","“My main treasure, stored in the hundred iron boxes, I dared not touch;
