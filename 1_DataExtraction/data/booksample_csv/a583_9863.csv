Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous locations.",She begs her respects to you all--along with which please present those of your humble servant.,"I laid down my goose feather to beat my brains for an apt simile, and had some thoughts of a country grannum at a family christening; a bride on the market-day before her marriage; or a tavern-keeper at an election dinner; but the resemblance that hits my fancy best is, that blackguard miscreant, Satan, who roams about like a roaring lion, seeking, searching, whom he may devour.","I particularly remember one half-stanza which was music to my boyish ear--   ""For though on dreadful whirls we hung      High on the broken wave--"" I met with these pieces in Manson's English Collection, one of my school-books.","MY DEAR LOVE,--I received your kind letter with a pleasure which no letter but one from you could have given me.","He was the only man I ever saw who was a greater fool than myself where woman was the presiding star;

come with the milder, gentle, easy inspirations, which thou breathest round the wig of a prating advocate, or the tÃªte of a tea-sipping gossip, while their tongues run at the light-horse gallop of clish-maclaver for ever and ever--come and assist a poor devil who is quite jaded in the attempt to share half an idea among half a hundred words;
