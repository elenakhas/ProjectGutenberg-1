"""Well,"" I said, ""if you deny the name to others who lay more claim to it, will you not at least allow it to the three or four painters who started with you in life?""","It is true that friends who are accustomed to our habit of thought and manner of expression sometimes catch our meaning before we have expressed it Not rarely, before our thought has reached that stage at which it becomes intelligible to a stranger, a word, a look, or a gesture will convey it perfectly and fully to a friend.","But when a genuine distinction had been earned by poetry that was in no way immature, Rossetti discovered, by the gratuitous revelation of a friend, that a copy of the youthful production--privately printed and never published--was actually in the library of the British Museum.",At length the time had arrived when it was considered prudent to retire.,"Later in our acquaintance, I found that he, like all meditative men, had the greatest conceivable dread of being taken unawares, and that there was no safer way for any fresh acquaintance to insure his taking violently against him, than to take the step of coming down upon him suddenly, and without appointment, or before a sufficient time had elapsed between the beginning of the friendship and the actual personal encounter, to admit of his forming preconceived ideas of the manner of man to expect.","There are men who feel more deeply the sense of isolation amidst the busiest crowds than within the narrowest circle of intimates, and I have heard from Rossetti reminiscences of his earlier life that led me to believe that he was one of the number.",[Here _Love Sweetness_ is printed.],You mention something he said to you of me and my      surroundings.,"This fourth and final message came to hand the morning after the meeting, when I had the satisfaction to reflect that (owing more perhaps to the plethora of other subjects of interest than to any suspicion of its being tabooed) I had luckily eschewed the proscribed topic.","Here the love involved is so etherealised as scarcely to be called human, save only on the part of the mortal dreamer, in whose yearning ecstasy the ear thinks it recognises a more earthly note.","I did send the _Dante and Circle_, but don't know if it was ever received or reviewed.",There are few indeed whom      the facile enthusiasm for contemporary models does not      deaden to the truly balanced claims of successful efforts in      art.,"""You can never say too much about Coleridge for me,"" Rossetti would write, ""for I worship him on the right side of idolatry, and I perceive you know him well.""",Shakspeare; felled by the Rev.,"Sheppard, Turpin, pleading with black tongue      This viler thief's unsuffocated breath!","I usually dine in my studio and in my painting coat!""",They are splendid      affairs.,"I have a      good number of sonnets for _The House of Life_ still in MS.,      which I have worked on with my best effort, and, I think,      will fully sustain their place.",I asked if his work usually took much out of him in physical energy.,In later life he used to tell with infinite zest a story of a blunder of earlier years which might easily have led to serious if not fatal results.,"Previously I was willing to believe in his unswerving loyalty to the much greater men who were his friends, but even that poor confidence in him must perforce be shaken when one finds him silent at a moment when Keats most needs his voice, and abusive when Coleridge is a common subject of ridicule.","At the time in question I was under the necessity of leaving him for a day or two every week in order to fulfil, a course of lecturing engagements at a distance; and upon my return in each instance I was told much of all that had happened to him in the interval.","I may here remark that I never resisted any idea of Rossetti's at the moment of its inception, since resistance only led to a temporary outburst of self-assertion on his part.","Faust is little better than a wizard from the first, for if knowledge had given him what he: sought, he had never had recourse to witchcraft!",Rossetti took a great interest in the fund started for the relief of Mme.,"To that false friend he came at this time with only too great assiduity, and the chloral, added to the seclusive habit of life, induced a series of terrible though intermittent illnesses and a morbid condition of mind in which for a little while he was the victim of many painful delusions.","""I certainly imagine,"" I replied, ""that a superior carpenter would find it hard to paint another _Dante's Dream_, which some people consider the best example yet seen of the English school.""","You certainly, in my opinion, ought to print Wells's sonnet.","In reply to this I told Rossetti that, as a ""jealous honourer"" of his, I confessed to some uneasiness when I read that he had been making important additions to _Sister Helen_.","That it could      have had on any man the effect you describe, I can scarcely      believe; indeed, I think that no living man had so little to      complain of as Rossetti, on the score of criticism.","But never either found another      To free the hollow heart from paining--      They stood aloof, the scars remaining,      Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;      A dreary sea now flows between,      But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,      Shall wholly do away, I ween,      The marks of that which once hath been.","The continuation in question was by one Eliza Stewart, and appeared in a shortlived monthly thing called _Smallwood's Magazine_, to which my father contributed some Italian poetry, and so it came into the house.","And as frequently as he called my attention to such favourable comment, he did so without a particle of vanity, and with only such joy as he may feel who knows in his secret heart he has depreciators, to find that he has ardent upholders too.",I have altered the last line of octave in _Lost Days_.,It would not be afc all found      that my best sonnets are always in the mere form which I      think the best.,It was      printed in a thing called _The Düsseldorf Annual_ in (I      think) 1853--published in Germany.,I have always said that twenty years after his death his name will be a familiar one.,The beauty of Beatrice in the _Vita Nuova_ is like a ray of sunshine flooding a landscape--we see it only in the effect it produces.,"It would be hard to find in his earlier work anything bearing more clearly the stamp of reality than the descriptions of the wreck in _The White Ship_, of the two drowning men together on the mainyard, of the morning dawning over the dim sea-sky--      At last the morning rose on the sea      Like an angel's wing that beat towards me-- and of the little golden-haired boy in black whose foot patters down the court of the king.","His own powers stand high in various ways--poetically higher      perhaps than is I at present admitted, despite his      detestable flutter and airiness for the most part.","Rossetti's primary interest in Chatterton dates back to an early period, as I find by the date, 1848, in the copy he possessed of the poet's works.",I cannot say that I like the conclusion nearly so      well as this.,"It was that where Coleridge says      Her silken robe and inner vest      Dropt to her feet, and full in view      Behold!","""I cannot tell you,"" he said, ""at what terrible moment it was wrung from me.""","The Shakspeare sonnet, spoken of in the letter as being withheld on account of its incongruity with the rest of the poems, was published in an early _Academy_, notwithstanding its jocose allusion to the worshipful body of tailors.","It was a cruel and irremediable wound inflicted upon a fine spirit, sensitive to attack beyond all sensitiveness hitherto known among poets.","He said: A sonnet, entitled _Nuptial Sleep_, is quoted and abused at page 338 of the Review, and is there dwelt upon as a “whole poem,” describing “merely animal sensations.” It is no more a whole poem in reality than is any single stanza of any poem throughout the book.","I had not written a line or put pen to paper for the purpose, but I could tell him, in general terms, what my unaccomplished marvel of sonnet-craft was to be about.","A remark in it to the effect that old age is usually more indulgent than middle life to the work of first manhood, and that, consequently, Rossetti would be a less censorious judge of his early efforts at a later period of life, seemed to show that the writer himself was no longer a young man.","“You can never say too much about Coleridge for me,” Rossetti would write, “for I worship him on the right side of idolatry, and I perceive you know him well.” Upon this one of my first remarks was that there was much in Coleridge’s higher descriptive verse equivalent to the landscape art of Turner.","However, for all I might desire in the direction spoken of,      volition is vain without vocation; and I had better really      stick to knowing how to mix vermilion and ultramarine for a      flesh-grey, and how to manage their equivalents in verse.","As you have the vols, of _Fortnightly_, look up a little poem of mine called the _Cloud Confines_, a few months later, I suppose, than the tale.",It is strange that there is not yet one complete edition of      him.,"I remember that, touching the last-mentioned of these poems, he remarked that out of his love of it while still a boy his own _Blessed Damozel_ originated.",You can pardon me now; for _so_ bad a pun      places me at your mercy indeed.,"“I know this is the final signal,” he said, “and I shall die.” I did my utmost to compose him by recounting afresh the personal incident hinted at, with many added features of (I trust) justifiable exaggeration, but it is hardly necessary to say that I did not hold the promise I gave him as to secrecy sufficiently sacred, or so exclusive, as to forbid my revealing the whole circumstance to his medical attendant.","He urged his grandson to finish the poem in question, promising it, in a completed state, the dignity and distinction of type.","The letters I am now to quote show the origin of those additions, and are interesting, as affording a view of the author's estimate of the gain in respect of completeness of conception, and sterner tragic spirit which resulted upon their adoption.","Skeat is a thorough philologist, but no hand      at all when substitution becomes unavoidable in the text....      Read the _Ballad of Charity, the Eclogues, the songs in      Ælla_, as a first taste.",Ah!,"In later years he was assuredly not altogether a hero as to personal suffering, and I afterwards found that, upon the periodical recurrence of the symptom, he never failed to become convinced that he spat arterial blood, and that on each occasion he had received his death-warrant.",I remarked that the pre-Raphaelite movement was no doubt a serious one at the beginning.,"of this volume, will show.","I made some playful allusion, assuredly not meant to involve Mr. Swinburne, to Sheridan's epigram on easy writing and hard reading; and to the Abbe de Marolles, who exultingly told some poet that his verses cost no trouble: ""They cost you what they are worth,"" replied the bard.",The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States.,"This is a sort of ballad-romance, such as _Christabel_ and _The Lay of the Last Minstrel_; and this, and this only, was what Rossetti aimed after, and entirely compassed in his fine works just mentioned.","I replied to this letter (containing, as it did, the expression of so much more than the necessary solicitude), by saying that I too had been haunted, but it had been by the fear that I had been asking too much of his attention.",Net results are certainly the poorest tests of relative values where the work done belongs to periods of development.,"I should be very      glad to know you, and would ask you, if you thought of      calling, to give me a day's notice when to expect you, as I      am not always able to see visitors without appointment.",Rossetti now perceived that higher agencies were at work: it was _not meant_ that he should get rid of the book: why should he contend against the inevitable?,"I lie on the couch, the racked and tortured medium, never permitted an instant's surcease of agony until the thing on hand is finished.""","Next morning, an old man of the riverside labourer class knocked at the door, bearing in his hands a small parcel rudely made up in a piece of newspaper that was greasy enough to have previously contained his morning's breakfast.","In youth, it was one of his pleasures to engage in exercises of sonnet-skill with his brother William and his sister Christina, and, even then, he attained to such proficiency, in the mere mechanism of sonnet structure, that he could sometimes dash off a sonnet in ten minutes--rivalling, in this particular, the impromptu productions of Hartley Coleridge.","The terms in which he had replied to my offer of it (so far from being of a kind to annoy or hurt me), had, to my thinking, been only generous, sympathetic, and beautiful.","as---           I wove a crown before her           For her I love so dearly,           A garland for Lenora!","on      Italian poetry which you mentioned in a former letter, and      which my book somewhat recalled to your mind.","Some mention was made in this connection of Rossetti's young connection, Oliver Madox Brown, who wrote _Gabriel Denver_ (otherwise _The Black Swan_) at seventeen years of age.","Some mention was made in this connection of Rossetti’s young connection, Oliver Madox Brown, who wrote _Gabriel Denver_ (otherwise _The Black Swan_) at seventeen years of age.","When there arose, subsequently, some idea of my reviewing the book, Rossetti wrote me the following letter, full of disinterested solicitude:      You will be quite delighted with an essay on Blake by Jas.","""That is friendly nonsense,"" rejoined my frank host, ""there is now no English school whatever.""","“Perfectly.” “Nurse Abrey cannot: what a good creature she is!” That night we telegraphed to Mr. Marshall, to Mr. W. M. Rossetti, and Mr. Watts, and wrote next morning to Mr. Shields, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Madox Brown.","Rossetti certainly never over-valued the applause of his own immediate circle, but still no man was more sensible of the value of the good opinion of one or two of his immediate friends.","Luke the Painter_, into      a sequence with two more not yet printed, and given the      three a general title of _Old and New Art_, as well as      special titles to each."
