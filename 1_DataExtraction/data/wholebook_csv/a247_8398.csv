course, if our telephone friend was the man who had brought these things about, he had done it to force you to do what he demanded.",But he would lose the effect of his lesson unless you understood

promptly.","""Are you sure?""","""I know my instruments pretty well; and I've had experience enough so I can tell by the sound of the sending about how far off they come from.""","""And this was from somewhere about one to two hundred miles away, you think?""","""Yes, sir.""","""Do you know whether any other instruments caught this?""","""No, only mine.""",He was very positive.,"""How do you know?""","""Mr. McCarthy had me inquire.""","""How do you account for it?""","""I don't know, except that maybe my instrument happened to be just tuned to catch it.",That's another reason I know it

do you want?""","""I want a job, a good engineering-construction job, for a friend of mine.""","""What can he do?""","""He can learn.","I want a good honest place where he can learn under a good

and out of doors,"" Darrow answered for him; ""streets, water, engineering.""","""It's a holdup,"" said McCarthy sullenly drawing a tablet toward himself, and thrusting the stub of a pencil into his mouth.","""A beneficent and just holdup,"" added Darrow; ""the first of its kind in this city.""",McCarthy glared at him malevolently.,"""It don't go unless you deliver the goods,"" he threatened.","""Understood,"" agreed Darrow.","""What's his name?""","demanded McCarthy, withdrawing the pencil stub, and preparing to write.","""His name,"" answered Darrow, ""is John Warford, Junior.""","McCarthy started to his feet with a bellow of rage, his face turning purple.","""Of all the infernal--!""","he roared, and stopped, as though stricken dumb.",For two or three words further his mouth and throat went through the motions of speech.,Then an expression of mingled fear and astonishment overspread his countenance.,He sank back into his chair.,Percy Darrow nodded twice and smiled.,"CHAPTER VII A WORLD OF GHOSTS A deathly stillness had all at once fallen like a blanket, blotting out McCarthy's violent speech.",The rattling typewriter in the next room was abruptly stilled.,"The roar of the city died as a living creature is cut by the sword--all at once, without the transitionary running down of most silences.","Absolute dense stillness, like that of a sea calm at night, took the place of the customary city noises.",In his astonishment McCarthy thrust a heavy inkstand off the edge of his desk.,"It hit the floor, spilled, rolled away; but noiselessly, as would the inkstand in a moving picture.","To have one's world thus suddenly stricken dumb, to be transported orally from the roar of a city to the peace of a woodland or a becalmed sea is certainly astonishing enough.","But this silence was particularly terrifying to both McCarthy and Jack Warford, though neither would have been able to analyze the reason for its weirdness.",For silence is in reality a composite of many lesser noises.,"In a woodland almost inaudible insects hum, breezes blow, leaves and grasses rustle; at sea the tiny waves lap the sides and equally tiny breaths of air stir the cordage; within the confines of the human shell the mere physical acts of breathing, swallowing, winking, the mere physical facts of the circulation of the blood, the beating of the heart, produce each its sound.",Even a man totally deaf feels the subtle influence of these latter physical phenomena.,"And underneath all sound, perceptible alike to those who can hear and those who can not, are the vibrations that accompany every activity of nature as the manifestations of motion or of life.",An ordinary deep silence is not so much an absence of sound as an absence of accustomed or loud sound.,And in that unusual hush often for the first time a man becomes acutely aware of the singing of the blood in his ears.,But this silence was absolute.,All these minor sounds had been eliminated.,"For a moment Boss McCarthy stared; then shoved back his chair with a violent motion, and rose.",He was like a shadow on a screen.,The filching from the world of one element of its every-day life had unexpectedly rendered it all phantasmagoric.,"As McCarthy shouted, and no sound came; as he moved from behind his desk, and no jar accompanied his heavy footfall, he appeared to lose blood and substance, to become unreal.","As no sound issued from his contorted face, So it seemed that no force would follow his blow, were he to deliver one.","He stumbled forward, dazed and groping as though he were in the dark, instead of merely in silence; a striking example in the uncertainty of his movements of how closely our senses depend on one another.","Jack spoke twice, then closed his lips in a grim straight line.","He held his elbows close to his sides, and looked ready for anything.",A look of mild triumph illumined Percy Darrow's usually languid countenance.,"He stepped quickly to the wall, and turned the button of the incandescent globe.",The light instantly glowed.,At this he nodded twice more.,"From his pocket he drew a note-book and pencil, wrote in it a few words, and handed it to the dazed and uncertain boss.","""I was right,"" Darrow had scrawled.","""This proves it.",It's by no means the end.,"Better be good.""",McCarthy's bulldog courage had recovered from its first daze.,"He began to see that this visitation was not entirely personal, but extended also to his two companions.","This relieved his mind, for he had suspected some strange new apoplexy.","""Did you expect this?""",he wrote.,Darrow nodded.,"Together the three ghosts left the phantom office, and glided down the phantom halls.",Other ghosts in various stages of alarm were already making their way down the stairs.,"Some of them spoke, but no sound came.","One woman, her eyes frightened, reached out furtively to touch her neighbor, apparently to assure herself of his reality.","Urged by an uncontrollable impulse, a man thrust his hand through the ground glass of an office door.","The glass shivered, and crashed to the tile floor.",The pieces broke--silently.,It was as though the man had been the figure in a cinematograph illusion.,He stared at his cut and bleeding hand.,The woman who had touched the man suddenly threw back her head and screamed.,"They could see her eyes roll back, her face change color, could discern the straining of her throat.",No sound came.,At this a panic seized them.,"They rushed down the stairs, clambering over one another, pushing, scrambling, falling.",A mob of a hundred men fought for precedence.,Blows were struck.,No faintest murmur of tumult came from their futile heat.,It might have been the riot of a wax-works in a vacuum.,"They fell into the lower hallway, and fought their way to the street, and stood there dazed and staring, a strange, wild-eyed, white-faced, bloody crew.","The hurrying avenue stopped to gaze on them curiously, gathering compact in a mob that blocked all traffic.",Policemen pushed their way in and began roughly to question--and to question in real audible words.,"But for the space of a full minute these people stood there staring upward, drinking in the blessed sound that poured in on them lavishly from the life of the street; drinking deep gulps of air, as though air had lacked.","Darrow, and with him Jack Warford, had descended more leisurely.","Before leaving the building Darrow placed the flat of his hands over his ears, and motioned Jack to do the same.",Thus they missed the stunning effect of receiving the world of noise all at once; as a man goes to a bright light from a dark room.,"Furthermore, Darrow returned several times from the sound to the silence, trying to determine where the line of demarcation was drawn.","Then, motioning to Jack, he began methodically to make his way through the crowd.",This proved to be by no means an easy task.,Rumors of all sorts were afoot.,Some bold spirits were testing a new sensation by venturing into the corridor of the building.,The police were undecided as to what should be done.,"One or two reporters were already at hand, investigating.","McCarthy, his assurance returned, was conversing earnestly with a police captain.","Percy Darrow, closely followed by Jack, managed to worm his way through the crowd, and finally debouched on Broadway.","""What was it?","What struck us?""",demanded Jack.,"""Do you know?""","""I can guess; in essence,"" said Percy.","""I was pretty sure after last evening's trouble; but this underscores it, proves it.","Also, it opens the way.""","""What do you mean?""","""Along the lines of these phenomena there are two more things possible.","Possible, I say.","They might be called certain, were we dealing only with theory; but there is still some doubt how the practical side of it may work out.""","""I suppose you know what you're talking about,"" said Jack resignedly.","""I don't.""","""You don't need to, yet.",But here's what I mean.,"If my theory is correct, we are likely to be surprised still further.""",Jack ruminated; then his engaging young face lighted up with a smile.,"""All right,"" said he; ""I'm enlisted for the war.","What have you got to do with it?""","""I'll explain this much,"" said Darrow; ""more I'll not tell at present, even to you.","If one breath should get out that any one suspected--well, this is a man-hunt.""","""Who's the man?""","""An enemy of McCarthy.""","""Whom you are going to find for him?""","""Perhaps.""","""And you were putting up that job for me as part of your pay!""",Percy Darrow smiled slowly.,"""As all of my pay--from McCarthy,"" said he.","""I was just bedeviling him.""","Jack Warford started to say something, but the scientist cut him short.","""This is bigger than McCarthy,"" he said decisively.","""We are the only people in this city who suspect a human origin of these phenomena.","Other men are yet working, and will continue to work, on the supposition that they are the results of some unbalanced natural conditions.","The phenomena are, as yet, harmless.","It will not greatly injure the city, once it is prepared, to be without electricity or without sound for limited periods.",I doubt very much whether the Unknown can continue these phenomena for longer than limited periods.,But conceivably this man may become a peril.,"He has, if I reason correctly, four arrows in his quiver; the fourth is dangerous.",It is our duty to find him before he uses the fourth arrow--if indeed he has discovered the method of doing so.,"That is always in doubt.""",Jack's eyes were shining.,"""Bully!""",he cried.,"""He may conceivably possess the power to launch the fourth and dangerous arrow, but may withhold it unless he believes himself suspected or close pressed.",His probable mental processes are obscure.,"At present he directs himself solely against McCarthy.""","Percy Darrow had been thinking aloud, and realized it with a smile.","""This is one of your jobs, fellow detective,"" said he.","""You've got to be a mark for me to think at.""","""I wish you'd think a little more clearly,"" observed Jack.","""It sounds interesting, but jumbled.","I feel the way I did when I began to read Greek.""","""McCarthy's incidental,"" observed Darrow in his detached tone.","""Eh?""","""Oh, I thought we might as well worry McCarthy by asking him for that job on the side.","It's amusing.""","""What do you want me to do?""",asked Jack.,"""This,"" said Darrow, with an unusual rapidity of utterance.","""See that thick-set, quick man in gray clothes?",He's a policeman.,"In a moment he'll arrest me.""","""Arrest you--why?""","demanded Jack, in tones of great astonishment.","""I reason that McCarthy will come to that conclusion.",He is beginning to think I have something to do with what he calls his annoyances.,I saw it in his eyes.,This last curious manifestation came along too pat.,"You remember, it cut off the dressing-down he was going to give me.""",Darrow chuckled in appreciation.,"""Didn't the humor of that strike you?""","""Me?","Oh, I was scared,"" admitted Jack.","""I want you to go home and tell Helen just what happened in the Atlas Building.",Do not tell her that I believe the phenomena are due to any human agency.,"Say simply that if it is repeated, and she happens to be within the zone of its influence, to keep calm, and wait.","It will pass, and it is not to be feared.","Tell her I said so.""","""Lord!""",cried Jack.,"""You don't think it's going to happen again!""","""Within the next twenty-four hours,"" said Darrow.","""Oughtn't we to warn the people?""","""And let our hidden antagonist know we are aware of his existence?""",inquired Darrow.,"""Anything else?""","""No--yes.",Buy a gun.,"If I bring you into any trouble, I'll see you clear.","You understand?""","""I do.""","""I rely on your being game.""","""To the limit,"" said Jack.","""Here comes your friend.",Won't this arrest ball things up?,"Shall I rustle bail?""","""No,"" said Darrow.","""I want to think.",All I need is all the papers.,"I'll be out by ten to-morrow morning, sure.""","""Why are you sure of that?""","""_Because by that hour McCarthy will have disappeared_,"" said Percy Darrow.","The man in the gray suit, having finished his scrutiny, lounged forward.","""You are Mr. Darrow,"" he stated.","""Sure I am, my amiable but obvious sleuth,"" drawled that young man.","""Lead on.""","He nodded a farewell to Jack, and linked his arm in that of the officer.",After a few moments he burst into an irrepressible chuckle.,"""The fat, thick-necked, thick-witted, old fool!""",said he.,"CHAPTER VIII PERCY DARROW'S THEORY Percy Darrow in the police station, where he had been assigned an unused office instead of a cell, amused himself reading the newspapers, of which he caused to be brought in a full supply.","Theories had begun to claim their share of the space which, up to now, the fact stories had completely monopolized.","Darrow, his feet up, a cigarette depending from one corner of his mouth, read them through to the end.",Then he indulged the white walls of his little apartment with one of his slow smiles.,The simplest of the theories had to do with comets.,"The most elaborate traced out an analogy between the ""blind spot"" in vision and a ""point of rest"" in physical manifestations--this ""point of rest"" had just now happened to drift to a crowded center, and so became manifest.","""Ingenious but fantastic youth,"" was Percy Darrow's tribute to the author, Professor Eldridge of the university.","The ""human-interest"" stories of both the evening before and those in the extras describing the latest freak in the Atlas Building, Darrow passed over with barely a glance.",But certain figures he copied carefully into his notebook.,"When he had found all of these, and had transcribed them, they appeared about as follows:   Atlas--Wednesday, 5:25.",3:00 (about): 9 hr.,35 min.,"General--Thursday, 6:00.",7:56 (exact): 1 hr.,56 min.,"Atlas--Friday, 10:10.",10:48 (exact): 38 min.,"On the basis of these latter figures he made some calculations which, when finished, he looked on with doubtful satisfaction.","""Need more statistics,"" said he to himself, ""before I can pose as a prophet.","Just now I'm merely a guesser.""",By now it was afternoon.,"An official came to announce visitors, and a moment later Helen and her brother came in.","As Percy's case was merely one of detention, or for some other obscurer reason, known only to those who took their orders from McCarthy, the three were left alone to their own devices.","At the sight of Helen's trim tailor-clad figure Percy's expression brightened to what, in his case, might almost be called animation.","He swept aside the accumulation of papers, and made room for both.","After the first greetings and exclamations, Helen demanded to know particulars and prospects.","""All right, I'll tell you,"" agreed Darrow.","""I'm thought out; and I want to hear it myself.""",Jack looked about him uneasily.,"""Is it wise to talk here?""",he asked.,"""I don't doubt they have arrangements for overhearing anything that is said.""","""I don't think they care what we say,"" observed Darrow.","""They are merely detaining me on some excuse or another that I haven't even taken the trouble to inquire about.""","""That must astonish them some,"" said Jack.","""And if they do overhear, I don't much care.","Now,"" said he, turning to Helen, ""we have here three strange happenings comprising two phenomena--the cutting off of the electricity, first in the Atlas Building, second in the city at large; and the cutting off of sound in the Atlas.","Although we are, of course, not justified in generalizing from one instance, what would you think by analogy would be the next thing to expect?""","""That sound would be cut off in the city,"" said Helen; ""but Jack has already delivered me your warning or advice,"" she added.","""Precisely.",Now as to theories of the ultimate cause.,Naturally this must have been brought about either by nature or by man.,"If by nature, it is exceedingly localized, not to say directed.","If by man, he must have in some way acquired unprecedented powers over the phenomena of electricity and sound.","These he can evidently, at will, either focus, as on the Atlas Building, or diffuse, as over the city.","For the moment we will adopt the latter hypothesis.""","""That it is a man in possession of extraordinary powers,"" said Helen, leaning forward in her interest.","""Go on.""","""We have, completed, only the phenomena of electricity,"" continued Darrow; ""the phenomena of sound remain to be completed.","We observe as to that (a)""--he folded back his forefinger--""the Atlas manifestation lasted about nine and a half hours; and (b)""--he folded his middle finger--""the city manifestation was a little less than two hours.""","""Yes,"" cried Jack, ""but then this second--"" ""One minute,"" interrupted Darrow; ""let me finish.","Now, let us place ourselves in the position of a man possessed of a new toy, or a new power which he has never tried out!","What would he do?""","""Try it out,"" said Jack.","""Certainly; try it out to the limit, to see just what it could do in different circumstances.","Now, take the lapses of time I have mentioned, and assume, for the sake of argument, that these powers are limited.""","""Just how do you mean--limited?""",asked Helen.,"""I mean exhaustible, like a watering-pot.","You can water just so much, and then you have to go back and fill up again.","In that case, we can suppose this man's stream will last nine hours and a half when he dribbles it down on one spot, like the Atlas Building; but it will empty itself in about two hours when he turns her upside down over a whole city.",There remains only the length of time necessary to refill the water-pot to round out our hypothesis.,"That is something more than nine hours and something less than fifteen.""","""How do you get those figures?""",demanded Jack.,"""The Unknown is anxious, after the Atlas success, to try out his discovery on the larger scale.",He will naturally do so at the first opportunity after his water-pot is refilled.,But he wishes to do so at the first effective opportunity.,What is the most effective moment?,The rush hours.,What are the rush hours?,"From eight to ten, and at six.","Since he did not pull off his show in the morning, we are fairly justified in concluding, tentatively, that the water-pot was not full by then, and, as the Atlas phenomena subsided at three of the morning before, the inference is obvious.""","""But isn't the most effective time at night, anyway, on account of the lights?""",asked Jack.,"""Good boy!""",approved Darrow.,"""He might have waited for that.",But the city-wide phenomena ceased at eight the night before; and the Atlas sound phenomena did not occur until ten the next morning--fourteen hours.,"Now, the most effective time to scare McCarthy was any time after nine.","McCarthy arrives as the clock strikes.""",Jack shook his head.,"""Oh, it's not proof; it's idle hypothesis,"" admitted Darrow.","""We shall have to test it.","But let's go on with it, anyway, and see how it works out.""","""What's McCarthy got to do with it?""",demanded Helen.,"""That's so, you aren't in touch there.""",Darrow sketched briefly the situation as it affected the boss.,Helen's eyes were shining with interest.,"""Now,"" continued Darrow, ""having tried out his new power to the limit, our friend would begin to use it only as he needed it.",There is now no reason to empty the water-pot entirely.,"All he wanted to do this morning was to scare McCarthy, and impress the public.",He did that in thirty-eight minutes.,"On the basis of fourteen hours to fill the water-pot, it is evident that he would be rehabilitated, ready for business, in an hour.","Therefore, all he is waiting for now is the most effective moment to try out his city-wide experiment of silence.","I imagine that will be about six.""","""Sounds reasonable,"" admitted Jack.","""Reasonable!","It's certain!""",cried Helen.,Darrow smiled.,"""No, only a wild hypothesis.""","""It'll scare people to death,"" observed Jack.","""They're scared already; and they're somewhat prepared by the performance this morning.","Besides, I don't see yet that human agency is suspected.""","""Don't you think you'd better warn people what is going to happen, and tell them there's nothing to be frightened of?""",pleaded Helen.,"""No,"" said Darrow, ""I do not.","It would confuse the phenomena, and they must be unconfused in order that I can either prove or disprove my hypothesis.","If this lasts about two hours, the fact will go far to prove me right.","If the next manifestation comes at about ten the next morning, we shall have established a periodicity, at least.","But if the man realizes that his existence is suspected, he will purposely vary in order to mix me up.""","""The next manifestation!""",cried Helen.,"""Then you think they will continue--"" ""Why not,"" smiled Darrow, ""until he has scared McCarthy out?""","""Which will it be next time, do you think?""","""Whatever happens, don't be frightened,"" said Darrow enigmatically.","""It seems to me there is something absurd about all this,"" said Helen.","""A man with such a discovery, such powers, using them in such a manner, for such a petty purpose!""","""He is, of course, crazy,"" Darrow said quietly; ""the methodical logical lunatic--the most dangerous sort.""","""What is it he has discovered?""",asked Jack.,"""I do not know, yet.""","""But you suspect?""","Darrow nodded, but would not explain.","""What will be the outcome?""","""I am going to cut loose from science and guess wildly,"" said Darrow, after a moment.","""To-morrow morning, somewhere about ten, McCarthy will disappear.""","""You said that before!""",cried Jack.,"""Well, I say it again,"" drawled Darrow.","CHAPTER IX THE GREAT SILENCE Percy Darrow sat quite calmly, though a little hungrily, through the first of the two hours of the Great Silence.","As it fell, he looked at his watch; then went on reading.",Strangely terrified faces flitted by the open door of his little room.,"About seven o'clock Darrow, struck by a sudden idea, arose, walked down the corridor outside, and quite deliberately set to work to force the light door.","As has been intimated, either by direct order of McCarthy or because of some vagueness of the orders, the young man had been confined, not in the jail proper, but in one of the living apartments of the wing.",Few realize how important a role sound plays in what might be called the defensives of our every-day life.,"Sight is important, to be sure, but it is more often corroborative than not; it is more often used to identify the source of the alarm that has been communicated through other channels.","When we are told of the hero--or the villain--that he stood ""with every sense alert"", our mental picture, in spite of the phrasing, is that of a man listening intently for the first intimations of what may threaten.",So it is in prison.,"The warders can, of necessity, remain within actual view of but a few of the prisoners a small proportion of the time.",But through those massive and silent corridors sound stands watch-dog for them.,"The minute scratch of a file, the vibrations attendant on the most cautious attempts against the stone structure, the most muffled footfall reports to the jailer that mischief is afoot.",Instantly he is on the spot to corroborate by his other faculties the warnings of the watch-dog of the senses.,Now the watch-dog was asleep.,"Percy Darrow reflected that, were it not for the terror of these unexplainable hours, the prisoners within or their friends without could assail their confines boldly and formidably, even with dynamite, and none would be the wiser if only none happened to be within actual visual range of the operations.",He himself quite coolly used the iron side piece to his bed as a battering-ram to break the locks of the door.,"Then he walked down the long corridor and out through the police station, bowing politely to the bewildered officers.",The latter did not attempt to stop him.,"The people in the streets were, for the most part, either standing stock-still, or moving slowly forward in a groping sort of fashion.","Darrow, for the second time, noticed how analogous to the deprivation of sight was the total deprivation of hearing and feeling vibration.",Traffic was at a standstill.,"People's faces were bewildered, for the most part; though here and there one showed contorted with the hysteria of fright, or exalted with some other, probably religious, emotion.",The same impression of ghostliness came to Darrow here as in the Atlas Building.,Visual causes were not producing their wonted aural effect.,"On the street corner a peanut vender's little whistle sent aloft bravely its jet of steam; the bells on a ragpicker's cart swung merrily back and forth on their strap; a big truck, whose driver was either undaunted or drunk, banged and clattered and rattled over the rough cobbles of a side street--but no sound came from any one of them.",This complete severance of one cause and effect was sufficient to discredit all natural laws.,No other cause and effect was certain.,"Everywhere people were touching things to see if they were solid, or wet, or soft, or hard, as the case might be.","Even Darrow felt, absurdly enough, that it would not be greatly serious to jump off the top of any building into the street.",Darrow swung confidently enough down the street.,"He was the only person, with the exception of the drunken truck driver, who moved forward at a natural and easy gait.",The effect was startling.,Darrow seemed to be the only real human being of the lot.,All the rest were phantasmagoric.,But as he proceeded down-town the spell was beginning to break.,People were communicating with one another by means of pencil and paper.,"Darrow was amused, on crossing the park, to see against the lighted windows on Newspaper Row the silhouetted forms of activity.","Evidently, the newspaper men were already at work on this fresh story.",Near the corner of the park Darrow saw standing a policeman of his varied acquaintance.,"The scientist walked up to this man, who was standing in the typical vacant uncertainty, smiled agreeably, clapped him on the back, and shook his hand.","The patrolman grasped Darrow's hand, but the look of groping uncertainty deepened on his face.","Darrow slipped his note-book from his pocket, and scribbled a few lines, which he showed to the officer.","The latter read, inwardly digested for a moment, and smiled.","""Keep your hair on,"" ran Darrow's screed.","""This will pass in a few minutes, and it won't hurt you, anyway.","Don't look like all these other dubs.""",He stood there companionably by the patrolman.,They looked about them.,"All at once, with this touch of normal, unafraid, human companionship, the weird horror of the situation fell away.","Darrow and his companion were seeing humanity disjointed from its accustomed habit, as one looks on a stage full of men hypnotized into belief of an absurdity.","Where the blotting out of electricity had been tragic, this, as soon as its utter harmlessness was realized, became comic.",All about through the park men were meeting the situation according to the limited ideas developed by a crustacean life of absolute dependence on the shell of artificial environment.,A considerable number of all sorts had fallen on their knees and were praying.,"One fat man in evening dress, with a silk hat and a large diamond stud showing between the lapels of a fur-lined coat, was particularly fervent.",By force of habit Darrow remarked on this individual.,"""I'll bet he hasn't been to church since he was a kid,"" he observed, of course inaudibly.","The policeman caught the direction of his look, however, and grinned with understanding.","Some stood frozen to one spot, their faces agonized, as a man would stand still were the earth likely to yawn anywhere.","Darrow would have liked to reassure these, for their eyes expressed a frantic terror.","One red-faced individual with white side-whiskers, looking exactly like the comic-paper caricatures of the trusts, had evidently refused to accept any arbitrary dictates of natural forces.",Probably he had never accepted any dictates of any kind.,"He was going from one taxicab to another, trying to command a driver to take him somewhere, talking vehemently and authoritatively, his face getting more and more purple with anger.",The taxicab drivers merely stared at him stupidly.,"""That old boy's kept his nerve,"" Darrow remarked, of course inaudibly, to his companion.","""But he'll die of apoplexy if he doesn't watch out.""","Again the policeman caught the direction of Darrow's glance, and grinned in understanding.","He reached his huge gloved hand for the young man's pencil and paper, on which he wrote the name of a man high in railroad circles, and grinned again with evident relish.",At this moment an entirely self-possessed young man swung across the street.,"He surveyed the two men sharply a moment, then approached, producing a sheaf of yellow paper as he did so.","""Professor Darrow?""",he wrote.,Darrow nodded.,"The young man pointed to himself, then to the Despatch Building.","""Cause?""","he wrote, and waved his hand.",Darrow shook his head.,"""Dangerous?""",Darrow shook his head again.,"The reporter was about to add another question, when Darrow reached for the paper.",It was thrust eagerly into his hand.,Darrow consulted his watch.,"""If,"" he wrote, ""you will wait here four minutes, I'll give you an interview.""","The reporter read this, and nodded.","""You're on!""",he added to the written dialogue.,"Then he produced a cigarette, lighted it, and joined the other two men in their amused survey of the public's performances.",During the four minutes that ensued Darrow examined the reporter speculatively.,Finally his eye lighted up with recollection.,CHAPTER X THE LIFTING OF THE SPELL The spell lifted.,The city broke into a roar.,"People sprang into rapid and violent motion, as though released from a physical lethargy.","""All over?""",asked the reporter.,He asked it in a loud shout.,"""All over,"" replied Darrow.","""You don't need to yell.","I'm not deaf.""",The reporter grinned.,"""I guess that's what everybody else in town is doing,"" he surmised.",Certainly this remark was justified by the sample in the square.,Every man was shouting at his neighbor to the lung-straining limit of his ability.,"Three exhorters, their eyes ablaze with fanaticism, began to thunder forth dire warnings of the wrath to come--and gained a hearing.",Men rushed to and fro aimlessly.,"The gentleman with the side-whiskers, who looked like the caricatures of the trusts, having at last succeeded in making his imperial wishes known, clambered into a taxicab, and sat back, apparently unimpressed.","After a moment the driver recovered sufficiently to fall into the habit of obedience, and so drove away.","While the three men watched, a burly individual with a red face came hurtling directly at them.","If they had not dodged hastily to one side, they would have suffered a collision.","""The end of the world is at hand!""",this man was shrieking.,"""Repent!","Repent!""","""That's Larry Mulcahey,"" remarked the reporter, with a grin.","""He keeps bar.""","""I'm hungry,"" observed Darrow.","""Haven't eaten since noon.""","""Free lunch,"" suggested the reporter practically.","""You won't be able to get any service anywhere.",How about that interview?,"Got anything to say?""","""You're the busy little bee to-night,"" said Darrow.","""But I'll tell you what I'll do.",I'll give you a tip.,"Be at the Atlas Building at not later than nine to-morrow morning, and stay at least until ten.","If you can fix it, be on the tenth floor.",Hunt up the United Wireless man and make him talk.,"Then come to me.""","""That's afternoon paper stuff--unless it's exclusive,"" said the reporter instantly.","""If you'll obey my orders the most important part of it will be exclusive,"" said Darrow.",The reporter eyed him keenly.,"""Why?""",he asked.,"""You're Hallowell, aren't you?",I thought I wasn't mistaken.,I saw you at work on that Duane Street murder case.,Your work was good.,"Besides, I like the _Despatch_--and the afternoon papers are too soon for what I want.""","""Last reason accepted.","Others received and placed on file.""","""All right,"" agreed Darrow.","""Have it your own way--only obey orders.""",He entered the door of the bar and advanced on the lunch counter.,"CHAPTER XI THIRTY SECONDS MORE At nine o'clock the following morning five men grouped in McCarthy's office, talking earnestly.",Darrow and Jack Warford had been the first to arrive.,McCarthy did not seem surprised to see them; nor did he greet them with belligerence.,"""Well?""",he demanded.,"""Well?""","repeated Darrow, sinking gracefully to one corner of the table.","""You're an old fool, McCarthy.","What good did you think it would do you to arrest me?""","""I intended to sweat you,"" confessed the boss frankly, ""but I was too busy.""","""Sweat me, eh?""","demanded Darrow, with some amusement.","""So you decided not to, did you--hence the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the police in effecting my recapture.","You didn't imagine I caused all this, did you?""","""I don't know,"" growled McCarthy.","""But if you, or the other fellow, or whoever or whatever it is, think you can bluff me out, you or he or it's left!","That's all!""","""So you've been getting more wireless, have you?""",surmised Darrow.,"McCarthy cast a surly glance toward Jack, whom previously he had ignored.","""Yes,"" he admitted grudgingly.",Darrow held out his hand.,"After a moment's hesitation McCarthy thrust forward a single yellow paper, and Darrow read aloud in spite of the boss' warning gesture:   ""McCarthy: The sign has been sent you and sent your people.","You are   stubborn, but it shall not avail you.",You must go; and within   twenty-four hours.,It will not avail you unless you go.,The _Celtic_   leaves to-morrow at noon.,You must go on that ship.,I shall know   whether or not you obey me.,Once more I shall warn you; one more   sign shall I send.,"Then I shall strike!""","""He's getting garrulous,"" remarked Darrow reflectively; ""but he's relieved my mind.","You'd better go.""","""Go!""","cried McCarthy, half starting to his feet.","""Not on your life!""",Darrow surveyed him calmly.,"""You're getting rattled,"" said he, ""and it doesn't pay you particularly to try to bluff me.","A jack-rabbit of average firmness could stampede you in your present state of mind.""","""You think so?""",sneered McCarthy.,"""I know so.",And you're quite right.,"If you attempt the game too long, he'll destroy you.""","""How?""",demanded McCarthy.,"""Take my word for it, _he can do it!_"" replied Darrow.","McCarthy ruminated, drumming his thick fingers on the desk.","""Find him,"" said he, at last.","""I intend to,"" replied Darrow.","""That'll be all right about your friend's job,"" conceded McCarthy, with a nod toward Jack.","""I fancy you won't have anything to do with it,"" returned Darrow pleasantly.",At this moment the door opened and Hallowell entered.,"He nodded to Darrow, and greeted McCarthy.","""Nothing for you,"" growled the latter.",Darrow glanced at his watch.,"""He will have in about five minutes,"" said he to the reporter.","The fifth member of the party now entered in the person of Simmons, the United Wireless operator.",On seeing the number gathered in McCarthy's office he came to a halt.,Darrow immediately detached himself from the group and approached this man.,"""Anything new?""",he inquired in a low voice.,Simmons glanced toward McCarthy.,"""New about what?""",he demanded stolidly.,"""Any more messages from our mysterious friend out in the ether to our equally mysterious friend at the desk?""","""I don't know what you mean.""",Darrow surveyed him reflectively.,"""This is a pretty big story,"" he said at last, ""and affects a lot of people.","If you really haven't leaked--well, he""--with a jerk of his head toward McCarthy--""must bribe high, or have a strangle hold on you for fair.""","He looked around to see the boss' eye fixed intently on him, smiled pleasantly, and moved to one side.","Simmons stepped forward, handed McCarthy a paper, and went out.","The boss read the message slowly, and turned a little pale.",After a moment or so he surreptitiously drew out his watch.,Percy Darrow smiled.,"He, too, held his watch in his hand.","""Thirty seconds more--about,"" he remarked pleasantly.",The boss looked up startled.,"The last thing he saw was the faintly smiling, triumphant face of the young scientist.",Then absolute blackness fell on him.,For several seconds astonishment held the inmates of the room chained to their places; and for that space of time no sound broke the deathly stillness.,"Then Percy Darrow spoke, in his natural voice.","""Well, Jack,"" he remarked, ""it worked out, to a second, almost.","Now I'm certain.""","As though this breaking of the silence had released a force hitherto held in repression, the room filled with tumult and clamor, with crashing, banging and scurrying of heavy bodies.","A final concussion shook the air, and then, again abruptly, silence fell.","""Say!""","Hallowell's voice spoke up, a trifle uncertainly.","""I'll stand for most any kind of a dark seance, but this particular spook business is getting on my nerves.","Are you there, Darrow?""","""Yes, I'm here,"" answered the scientist.","""Well, can you explain _that_ phenomenon?""","""That,"" drawled Darrow, a slight note of laughter in his voice, ""was that extraordinary upheaval of natural forces known as Brother McCarthy going away from here--hastily.""",Jack chuckled.,"""He hit me on the way out,"" remarked that young man.","""I'll testify he was a solid spook.""","The reporter was methodically striking match after match, but without result.",After a moment the acrid smell of burning woolen rose in the air.,"""Are you dropping those matches?""",asked Darrow.,"""Sure; they're no good.""","""Well, they're good enough to burn holes in McCarthy's rugs.","Stamp around a little to put them out; and quit it.""","""What next; and how long?""",asked Jack.,"""What is it?","Have we gone blind, or is it a total eclipse, or what?""","""I don't know how long,"" came back Darrow's voice calmly.","""Next we will get out of the building.",I want to make some observations.,"Get hold of my hand; we'll have to grope our way out.""","""If we could only get a light,"" muttered Hallowell.","""You can't,"" stated Darrow.",They felt their way down the ten flights of stairs like blind men.,"A few inmates of the building they jostled, or passed, or picked up on the way.","""This settles it,"" one remarked profanely.","""My lease quits.",They can sue and be damned.,"I decline to have anything more to do with any freak-lined skyscraper of this description.""",In the lower corridors Darrow halted them.,"""Here's another thing,"" said he: ""if I'm right, we should run out of this just eleven feet beyond the last elevator cage.""","He felt his way along the grill, made four paces forward, and uttered a little cry of satisfaction.",The two men followed him blindly.,As though stepping from one room to another they emerged into glaring daylight!,Both involuntarily looked back.,"The darkness hung there like a curtain, just inside the outer walls of the building.",Already a crowd had gathered to observe this new and strange phenomenon of the now celebrated Atlas Building.,"It was a curious and a facetious crowd, but not awestricken, as it had been at the first manifestations of this freakish upset of natural forces.",A man observing the flight of an aeroplane for the first time loses his sense of strangeness inside of a few minutes; and yet flying has been since the days of Icarus considered one of the impossible achievements.,So the general public of Manhattan were becoming accustomed to reversals of form in the affairs of the physical world.,"The frivolous majority, having discovered nothing to be apprehended from the phenomena save a few hours' helplessness of a sort, and much to be gained through the savor of novelty, were inclined to an amused or irritated attitude, depending on the extent to which its occupations were interfered with.",The minority took to religious meetings and interpretations.,"Darrow's exit, and that of his companions, was greeted uproariously.","""'Please go 'way an' let me sleep!'""","sang one, at the blinking men.","""Here's another!""",shrilled a gamin.,"""Get up!","The porter wants to make up your berth!""","Several of the crowd, pending the usual arrival of the police to clear the corridor, had ventured through the wide portals, and were experimenting with this strange palpable quality of darkness.","One or two popped inside the curtain, but emerged quickly, looking a little scared.","A bright youth made the discovery that if one lighted a match and stepped within the blackness, the match was immediately extinguished, but that upon emerging into daylight the flame came up again.",Some one happened along with a plumber's gasoline torch.,Immediately this was lighted and the experiment repeated.,"The bearer of the torch, astonished at the instant extinguishment of the flame, felt with his hand to see what could be the matter.","Instantly he uttered a yelp of pain, and leaped outside, displaying a badly burned palm.","""There wasn't no flame; I swear it!""","he explained excitedly, ""but she burned, just the same!""","He rushed about from one to another, displaying his injured palm to whoever would look.",Darrow paid little attention to this gathering crowd.,"First of all, he scanned a paper he held in his hand; then plunged back again into the blackness.","Jack Warford and Hallowell, left together, hesitated uncertainly.","""He'll be back,"" the reporter decided finally, ""and he's the man to tie to.""","While waiting, he proceeded to pick up what information he could from the bystanders.","It seemed that the first intimation of anything wrong was followed very shortly by the emergence of McCarthy, disheveled, hatless, staring, gasping.","The boss had stumbled into the street, hesitated, then started south on a run.","Before any one could stop him, he had turned a corner and disappeared.",The excitement at the Atlas Building had distracted attention from him.,Nobody wondered at his getting rattled and running away.,"The few tenants remaining in the building had stumbled forth, vowing never to return to such a--assorted adjectives--building.",That was all there seemed to be to say.,In the meantime the crowd had increased from a few hundred to thousands.,Police appeared.,The corridors were cleared of all but a few.,"Among these were Hallowell and Jack Warford; the former as a reporter, the latter as the reporter's companion.",Doctor Knox and Professor Eldridge arrived shortly.,"After a time Darrow reappeared, sauntering quite calmly from the pall of darkness, as though emerging from behind a velvet curtain.",CHAPTER XII THE UNKNOWN It will now become necessary to glance in passing at the personal characteristics of Professor Eldridge.,"This man was in about his fortieth year, tall, spare, keenly intellectual in countenance, cold, possessed of an absolute reliance on the powers of science, beyond which his mental processes did not stray.","His manner was distinguished by a stiff unbending formality; his expression by a glacial coldness of steel-gray eyes and a straight-line compression of thin lips; his dress by a precise and unvarying formalism, and his speech by a curious polysyllabic stiffness.","This latter idiosyncrasy would, in another, have seemed either priggish or facetiously intended.",With Professor Eldridge it was merely a natural method of speech.,"Thus, arriving once at the stroke of the dinner hour, he replied to compliments on his punctuality by remarking: ""I have always considered punctuality a virtue when one is invited to partake of gratuitous nourishment.""","Withal, his scientific attainments were not only undoubted, but so considerable as to have won for him against many odds the reputation of a great scientist.","His specialty, if such it might be called, was scientific diagnosis.","The exactness of scientific laws was so admirably duplicated by the exactitudes of his mind that he seemed able, by a bloodless and mechanical sympathy, to penetrate to the most obscure causes of the strangest events.","It might be added that practically his only social ties were those with the Warfords, and that the only woman with whom he ever entered into conversation was Helen.",At sight of him Percy Darrow's lounging gait became accentuated to exaggeration.,"""Hello, Prof!""",he drawled.,"""On the job, I see.","Good morning, Doctor,"" he greeted Knox.","""What do you make of it?""","""I make of it that the Atlas Building will shortly be without tenants,"" replied the doctor; ""me, for one.""",Eldridge surveyed Darrow coldly through the glittering toric lenses of his glasses.,"""The cause of these extraordinary phenomena is self-evident,"" he stated.","""You mean their nature, not their cause,"" replied Darrow.","""In nature, they refer back to the interference with etheric and molecular vibrations.","That,"" he added, ""is a fact that every boy in the grammar-school physics class has figured out for himself.","The cause is a different matter.""","""I stand corrected,"" said Eldridge.","""Such lapses in accuracy of statement are not usual with me, but may be considered as concomitant with unusual circumstances.""","""Right-o!""",agreed Darrow cheerfully.,"""Well, what about the causes?""","""That I will determine when I am satisfied that all the elements of the problem are in my hands.""","""Right-o!""",repeated Darrow.,"""Well, I'll bet you a new hat I'll land the cause before you do.","Be a sport!""","""I never indulge in wagers,"" replied Eldridge.","""Well,"" said Darrow to Jack and Hallowell, ""come on!""","Without waiting to see if he was followed, the young man again plunged into the black and clinging darkness.","""Get hold of my coat,"" his voice came to the others.","""We're going to climb.""","Accordingly they climbed, in silence, up many flights of stairs, through the cloying darkness.","At last Darrow halted, turned sharp to the left, fumbled for a door, and entered a room.","""Simmons?""",he said.,"""Here!""",came a voice.,"""I thought you'd be on the job,"" said Darrow, with satisfaction.","""How's your instrument?","Going, eh?","We are in the wireless offices,"" he told the others.","""Sit down, if you can find chairs.","We'll wait until the sun is shining brightly, love, before we really try to get down to business.","In the meantime--"" ""In the meantime--"" repeated both Jack and Hallowell, in a breath.","""Go on, my son,"" conceded the latter.","""I bet we have the same idea.""","""Well, I was going to say that I'm not in the grammar-school physics class, and I want to know what you meant by your remark to Eldridge,"" said Jack.","""That's my trouble,"" said Hallowell.","""It's simple enough,"" began Darrow.","""We have had, first, a failure of all electricity; second, a failure of all sound; third, a failure of all light.",The logical mind would therefore examine these things to see what they have in common.,The answer simply jumps at you: _Vibration_.,Electricity and light are vibrations in ether; sound is vibration in air or some solid.,"Therefore, whatever could absolutely stop vibration would necessarily stop electricity, light and sound.""","""But,"" objected Jack, ""if vibration were absolutely stopped, why wouldn't they all three be blotted out at once?""","""Because,"" explained Darrow, ""the vibrations making these three phenomena are different in character.","Sound is made by horizontal waves, for example, while electricity and light are made by transverse waves.","Furthermore, the waves producing electricity and light differ in length.","Now, it is conceivable that a condition which would interfere with horizontal waves would not interfere with transverse waves; or that a condition which would absolutely deaden waves two hundred and seventy ten-millionths of an inch long would have absolutely no effect on those one hundred and fifty-five ten-millionths of an inch long.","Am I clear?""","""Sure!""",came the voices of his audience.,"""That much Eldridge and any other man trained in elementary science already knows.","It is no secret.""","""It hasn't been published,"" observed Hallowell grimly.","""Well, go to it!","The task of the independent investigator, of which we are some, is now to discover, first, what are those conditions, and, second, what causes them.","With the exception of Mr. Hallowell, we all know what this guiding power is.""","""Don't get it,"" growled Simmons.","""Now, look here, Simmons, you are very loyal to McCarthy, for whatever reason, but your loyalty is misplaced.","For one thing, your man has disappeared, and will not return.",That last message scared him out.,"For another thing, we're going to need you in our campaign, the worst way.""","""I'm from Copenhagen; you got to show me,"" said Simmons.",Darrow laughed softly.,"""We'll show you, all right,"" said he.","He sketched briefly for Hallowell's benefit the reasoning already followed out, and which it is therefore unnecessary to repeat here.","""So now,"" he concluded, ""we will consider this hypothesis: that these phenomena are caused by one man in control of a force capable of deadening vibrations in ether and solids within certain definite limits.""","""Why do you limit it?""",cried Hallowell.,"""Because we have had but one manifestation at a time.",If this Unknown were out really to frighten--which seems to be his intention--it would be much more effective to visit us with absolute darkness and absolute silence combined.,That would be really terrifying.,He has not done so.,"Therefore, I conclude that his power is limited in applicability.""","""Isn't that a little doubtful?""",spoke up Jack.,"""Of course,"" said Darrow cheerfully.","""That's where we're going to win out on this sporting proposition with our dear Brother Eldridge.",He won't accept any hypothesis unless it is absolutely copper-riveted.,"We will.""","""I think you underestimate Eldridge,"" spoke up Hallowell.","""He's the only original think-tank in a village of horse troughs.""","""I don't underestimate him one bit,"" countered Darrow; ""but we have a head start on him with our reasoning; that's all.","He's absolutely sure to come to the conclusions I have just detailed, only he'll get there a little more slowly.","That's why I want you in on this thing, Hallowell.""","""How's that?""","""We'll publish everything up to date and cut the ground from under him.""","""What's your special grouch on Eldridge, anyway?""",asked Jack.,"""I like to worry him,"" replied Percy Darrow non-committally.",At this moment the darkness disappeared as though some one had turned a switch.,"The reporter, the operator and the scientist's young assistant moved involuntarily as though dodging, and blinked.",Darrow shaded his eyes with one hand and proceeded as though nothing had happened.,"""Here are the exclusive points of your story,"" he said to Hallowell, handing him a sheaf of yellow wireless forms.","""I got them in McCarthy's office.","They are messages from the unknown wielder of the mysterious power to his enemy, the political boss.","There will be plenty who will conclude these messages to be the result of fanaticism, after the fact; that is to say, they will conclude some wireless amateur has taken advantage of natural phenomena and, by claiming himself the author of them, has attempted to use them against his enemy.","Of course, the answer to that is that if the Unknown--let's call him Monsieur X--did not cause these strange things, he at least knew enough about them to predict them accurately.""","""You just leave that to me,"" hummed Hallowell under his breath.","The reporter had been glancing over the wireless forms, and his eyes were shining with delight.","""Here is the last one,"" said Darrow, producing a crumpled yellow paper from his pocket.","""I went back after it.""","""McCarthy: My patience is at an end.",Your last warning will be sent   you at nine thirty this morning.,If you do not sail on the Celtic at   noon I shall strike.,"You are of a stubborn and a stiff-necked   generation, but I am your lord and master, and my wrath shall be   visited on you.","Begone, or you shall die the death.""","""That bluffed him out,"" said Darrow, ""and I don't blame him.","Now, Simmons,"" said he, turning to the operator, who had sat in utter silence, ""how about it?","Are you with us, or against us?""","""How do you mean?""",demanded Simmons.,"""This,"" said Darrow sharply.","""The time has passed for concealment.",Every message through the ether must now reach the public.,We must send messages back.,The case is out of private hands; it has become important to the people.,"Will you agree on your honor faithfully to transmit?""","He leaned forward, his indolent frame startlingly tense.","""Are you afraid of McCarthy?""","""He's been good to me--it's a family matter,"" muttered the operator.","""Well--"" Darrow arose, crossed to the operator, and whispered to him for a moment.","""You see the seriousness--you are an intelligent man.""",The operator turned pale.,"""I hadn't thought of that,"" he muttered.","""I hadn't thought of that.","Of course I'm with you.""","""I thought you would be,"" drawled Percy Darrow slowly.","""If you hadn't decided to be, I'd have had another man put in your place.","Hadn't thought of that, either, had you?""","""No, sir,"" replied Simmons.","""Well, I prefer you.","It's no job for a quitter, and I believe you'll stick.""","""I'll stick,"" repeated Simmons.","""Well, to work,"" said Darrow, lighting the cigarette he had been playing with.","""Send this out, and see if you can reach Monsieur X.","""'_M_,'"" he dictated slowly.","""'Do you get this?'","Repeat that until you get a reply.""",Without comment the operator turned to his key.,The long ripping crashes of the wireless sender followed the movements of his fingers.,"""I get his '_I_--_I_,'"" he said, after a moment.","""It's almighty faint.""","""Good!""",said Darrow.,"""Give him this:   ""'McCarthy has disappeared.","Can no longer reach him with your   messages.'""","""He merely answers '_I_--_I_,'"" observed the operator.","""By the way,"" asked Darrow, ""what is your shift, anyhow?","Weren't you on at night when this thing began?""","""I'm still on at night; but Mr. McCarthy sent me a message, and asked me to stay on all this morning as a personal favor to him.""","""I see.","Then you're still on at night?""","""Yes, sir.""","""Well, tell Monsieur X that fact, put yourself at his disposal, and tell him he'd better get all his messages to you rather than to the other operators here.""","""All right.""","""There's your story,"" said Darrow to Hallowell; ""it's in those messages.",The scientific aspect will probably be done by somebody for the evening papers.,"You better concentrate on Monsieur X's connection with McCarthy.""","""Say, my friend,"" said Hallowell earnestly, ""do you think I'm a reporter for the _Scientific American_ or a newspaper?""",All three rose.,The operator was busy crashing away at his Leyden jars.,"""What next?""",asked Jack.,"""That depends on two things.""","""Whether or not McCarthy takes the _Celtic_,"" interposed Hallowell quickly.","""And whether Monsieur X will be satisfied with his mere disappearance, if he does not take the _Celtic_,"" supplemented Darrow.","""In any case, we've got to find him.",He's unbalanced; he possesses an immense and disconcerting and a dangerous power; he is becoming possessed of a _manie des grandeurs_.,You remember the phrasing of his last message?,"'I am your lord and master, and my wrath shall be visited on you.",Begone!',That is the language of exaltation.,"Exaltation is not far short of irresponsible raving.""","""What possible clue--"" began Jack Warford blankly.","""When a man is somewhere out in the ether there is no clue,"" replied Darrow.","""Then how on earth can you hope to find him?""","""By the exercise of pure reason,"" said Darrow calmly.","CHAPTER XIII DARROW'S CHALLENGE With a final warning to Simmons as to the dissemination of any information without consulting him, Darrow left the room.",Hallowell listened to this advice with unmixed satisfaction; the afternoon papers would not be able to get at his source of information.,The reporter felt a slight wonder as to how Darrow had managed his ascendency over the operator.,An inquiry as to that met with a shake of the head.,"""I may have to ask your help in that later,"" was his only reply.","At the corner, after pushing through a curious crowd, the men separated.",Hallowell started for the wharf; Jack Warford for home--at Darrow's request.,"The scientist returned to his own apartments, where he locked himself in and sat for five hours cross-legged on a divan, staring straight ahead of him, doing nothing.","At the end of that time he cautiously stretched his legs, sighed, rose, and looked into the mirror.","""I guess you're hungry,"" he remarked to the image therein.",It was now near mid-afternoon.,"Percy Darrow wandered out, ate a leisurely meal at the nearest restaurant, and sauntered up the avenue.","He paused at a news stand to buy an afternoon paper, glanced at the head-lines and a portion of the text, and smiled sweetly to himself.",Then he betook himself by means of a bus to the Warford residence.,"Helen was at home, and in the library.",With her was Professor Eldridge.,The men greeted each other formally.,After a moment of general conversation Darrow produced the newspaper.,"""I see you have your theories in print,"" he drawled.","""Very interesting.","I didn't know you'd undertaken grammar-school physics instruction.""","""I know I'm going to be grateful for any sort of instruction--from anybody,"" interposed Helen.","""I'm all in the dark.""","""Like the Atlas Building,"" Darrow smiled at her.","""Well, here's a very good exposition in words of one syllable.",I'll leave you the paper.,"Professor, what have you concluded as to the causes?""","""They are yet to be determined.""","""Pardon me,"" drawled Darrow, ""they have been determined--or at least their controlling power.""","""In what way, may I ask?""",inquired Professor Eldridge formally.,"""Very simply.",By the exercise of a little reason.,"I am going to tell you, because I want you to start fairly with me; and because you'll know all about it in the morning, anyway.""","""Your idea--the one you told us yesterday--is to be published?""","cried Helen, leaning forward with interest.","""The basis of it will be,"" replied Darrow.","""Now""--he turned to Eldridge--""listen carefully; I'm not going to indulge in many explanations.","Malachi McCarthy, political boss of this city, has made a personal enemy of a half-crazed or at least unbalanced man, who has in some way gained a limited power over etheric and other vibrations.","This power Monsieur X, as I call him--the Unknown--has employed in fantastic manifestations designed solely for the purpose of frightening his enemy into leaving this country.""","Eldridge was listening with the keenest attention, his cold gray eyes glittering frostily behind their toric lenses.","""You support your major hypothesis, I suppose?""",he demand calmly.,"""By wireless messages sent from Monsieur X to McCarthy, in which he predicts or appoints in advance the exact hour at which these manifestations take place.""","""In advance, I understand you to say?""","""Precisely.""","""The proof is as conclusive for merely prophetic ability as for power over the phenomena.""","""In formal logic; not in common sense.""","Eldridge reflected a moment further, removing his glasses, with the edge of which he tapped methodically the palm of his left hand.","Helen had sunk back into the depths of her armchair, and was watching with immobile countenance but vividly interested eyes the progress of the duel.","""Granting for the moment your major hypothesis,"" Eldridge stated at last, ""I follow your other essential statements.","The man is unbalanced because he chooses such a method of accomplishing a simple end.""","""Quite so.""","""His power is limited because it has been applied to but one manifestation of etheric vibration at a time; and each manifestation has had a defined duration.""",Darrow bowed.,"""You are the only original think-tank,"" he quoted Hallowell's earlier remark.","""You are most kind to place me in possession of these additional facts,"" said Eldridge, resuming his glasses, ""for naturally my conclusions, based on incomplete premises, could hardly be considered more than tentative.","The happy accident of an acquaintance with the existence of these wireless messages and this personal enmity gave you a manifest but artificial advantage in the construction of your hypothesis.""","""Did I not see you in the corridor of the Atlas Building the day of the first electrical failure?""",asked Darrow.,"""Certainly.""","""Then you had just as much to go on as I did,"" drawled Darrow, half closing his eyes.","The long dark lashes fell across his cheek, investing him in his most harmless and effeminate look.","""I fail to--"" ""Yes, you fail, all right,"" interrupted Darrow.","""You had all the strings in your hands, but you were a mile behind me in the solution of this mystery.","I'll tell you why: it was for the same reason that you're going to fail a second time, now that once again I've put all the strings in your hands.""","""I must confess I fail to gather your meaning,"" said Professor Eldridge coldly.","""It was for the same reason that always until his death you were inferior to dear old Doctor Schermerhorn as a scientist.","You are an almost perfect thinking machine.""","Darrow quite deliberately lighted a cigarette, flipped the match into the grate, and leaned back luxuriously.","Professor Eldridge sat bolt upright, waiting.",Helen Warford watched them both.,"""You have no humanity; you have no imagination,"" stated Darrow at last.","""You follow the dictates of rigid science, and of logic.""","""Most certainly,"" Eldridge agreed to this, as to a compliment.","""It takes you far,"" continued Darrow, ""but not far enough.",You observe only facts; I also observe men.,You will follow only where your facts lead; I am willing to take a leap in the dark.,"I'll have all this matter hunted out while you are proving your first steps.""","""That, I understand it, is a challenge?""","demanded Eldridge, touched in his pride of the scientific diagnostician.","""That,"" said Percy Darrow blandly, ""is a statement of fact.""","""We shall see.""","""Sure!""",agreed Darrow.,"""Now, the thing to do is to find Monsieur X. I don't know whether your curiously scutellate mind has arrived at the point where it is willing to admit the existence of Monsieur X or not; but it will.",The man who finds Monsieur X wins.,"Now, you know or can read in the morning paper every fact I have.","Go to it!""",Eldridge bowed formally.,"""There's one other thing,"" went on Darrow in a more serious tone of voice.","""You have, of course, considered the logical result of this power carried to its ultimate possibility.""","""Certainly,"" replied Eldridge coldly.","""The question is superfluous.""","""It is a conclusion which many scientific minds will come to, but which will escape the general public unless the surmise is published.","For the present I suggest that we use our influence to keep it out of the prints.""",Eldridge reflected.,"""You are quite right,"" said he; and rose to go.",After his departure Helen turned on Darrow.,"""You were positively insulting!""","she cried, ""and in my house!","How could you?""","""Helen,"" said Darrow, facing her squarely, ""I maintained rigidly all the outer forms of politeness.",That is as far as I will go anywhere with that man.,"My statement to him is quite just; he has no humanity.""","""What do you mean?","Why are you so bitter?""","asked Helen, a little subdued in her anger by the young man's evident earnestness.","""You never knew Doctor Schermerhorn, did you, Helen?""",he asked.,"""The funny little old German?","Indeed, I did!","He was a dear!""","""He was one of the greatest scientists living--and he was a dear!","That goes far to explain him--a gentle, wise, child-like, old man--with imagination and a Heaven-seeking soul.","He picked me up as a boy, and was a father to me.","I was his scientific assistant until he was killed, murdered by the foulest band of pirates.","Life passes; and that is long ago.""",He fell silent a moment; and the girl looked on this unprecedented betrayal of feeling with eyes at once startled and sympathetic.,"""Doctor Schermerhorn,"" went on Darrow in his usual faintly tired, faintly cynical tone, ""worked off and on for five years on a certain purely scientific discovery, the nature of which you would not understand.",In conversation he told its essentials to this Eldridge.,Doctor Schermerhorn fell sick of a passing illness.,"When he had recovered, the discovery had been completed and given to the scientific world.""","""Oh!""",cried Helen.,"""What a trick!""","""So I think.",The discovery was purely theoretic and brought no particular fame or money to Eldridge.,"It was, as he looked at it, and as the doctor himself looked at it, merely carrying common knowledge to a conclusion.",Perhaps it was; but I never forgave Eldridge for depriving the old man of the little satisfaction of the final proof.,It is indicative of the whole man.,"He lacks humanity, and therefore imagination.""","""Still, I wish you wouldn't be quite so bitter when I'm around,"" pleaded Helen, ""though I love your feeling for dear old Doctor Schermerhorn.""","""I wish you could arrange to get out of town for a little while,"" urged Darrow.","""Isn't there some one you can visit?""","""Do you mean there is danger?""","""There is the potentiality of danger,"" Darrow amended.","""I am almost confident, if pure reason can be relied on, that when the time comes I can avert the danger.""","""Almost--"" said Helen.","""I may have missed one of the elements of the case--though I do not think so.","I can be practically certain when I telephone a man I know--or see the morning papers.""","""Telephone now, then.",But why 'when the time comes'?,"Why not now?""",Darrow arose to go to the telephone.,He shook his head.,"""Let Eldridge do his best.",He has always succeeded--triumphantly.,"Now he will fail, and he will fail in the most spectacular, the most public way possible.""","He lifted his eyes, usually so dreamy, so soft brown.",Helen was startled at the lambent flash in their depths.,He sauntered from the room.,After a moment she heard his voice in conversation with the man he had called.,"""Hallowell?""","he said, ""good luck to find you.",Did our friend leave on the _Celtic_?,No?,Sure he didn't sneak off in disguise?,I'll trust you to think of everything.,Sure!,"Meet me at Simmons' wireless in half an hour.""",Helen heard the click as he hung up the receiver.,A moment later he lounged back into the room.,"""All right,"" he said.","""My job's done.""","""Done!""",echoed Helen in surprise.,"""Either I'm right or I'm wrong,"" said Darrow.","""Every element of the game is now certainly before me.",If my reasoning is correct I shall receive certain proof of that fact within half an hour.,"If it is wrong, then I'm away off, and Eldridge's methods will win if any can.""","""What is the proof?",Aren't you wildly excited?,"Tell me!""",cried Helen.,"""The proof is whether or not a certain message has been received over a certain wireless,"" said Darrow.","""I'll know soon enough.","But that is not the question; can not you get out of town for a little while?""",Helen surveyed him speculatively.,"""If there is no danger, I can see no reason for it,"" she stated at length, with decision.","""If there is danger you should warn a great many others.""","""But if that warning might precipitate the danger?""","""Shall I go or stay?""","she demanded, ignoring the equivocation.",Darrow considered.,"""Stay,"" he decided at last.","""I'll bet more than my life that I'm right,"" he muttered.","""Now,"" he continued, a trifle more briskly, ""be prepared for fireworks.",Unless I'm very much mistaken this little old town is going variously and duly to be stood on its head at odd times soon.,That's the way I size it up.,Don't be frightened; don't get caught unprepared.,I think we've had the whole bag of tricks.,"At almost any moment we're likely to be cut off from all electricity, all sound, or all light--never more than one at a time.","I imagine we shall have ample warning, but perhaps not.","In any case, don't be frightened.",It's harmless in itself.,Better stay home nights.,You can reassure your friends if you want to; but on no account get my name in this.,"If I am quoted, it will do incalculable harm.""","""Why not tell the public that it is harmless?""",demanded Helen.,"""Think of the anxiety, the accidents, the genuine terror it would save.""",Darrow rose slowly to go.,"He walked quite deliberately over to Helen, and faced her for a moment in silence.","""Helen,"" he said impressively at last,

the rug, staring after him, a new expression in her eyes.",She had known Percy Darrow for many years.,"Always she had appreciated his intellect, but deprecated what she had considered his indolence, his softness of character, his tendency to let things drift.",For the first time she realized that not invariably do manners make the man.,"CHAPTER XIV THE FEAR OF DANGER Before leaving the house, Darrow summoned Jack Warford.","""Come on, old bulldog,"" said he.","""You're to live with me a while now.","The game is closing down.""","""Bully,"" said Jack.","""I'll pack a suit case.""","""Have it done for you, and sent down to my place.","We must hustle for the Atlas Building now.""","""What's doing?""","asked Jack, as they boarded a surface car.","""Absolutely nothing--for some time

office.","""Thought you were on night duty,"" said he.","""I am,"" replied Simmons curtly.","""But judging by what you said this morning, I considered I'd better be on the job myself.""","""Good boy,"" approved Darrow.","""I see I've made no mistake in you.","Just stick it out twelve hours more, and we'll have it settled.","Anything more?""",Simmons thrust a message across the table.,Darrow took it quite calmly.,At this moment Hallowell entered.,"""What time did this come?""","asked Darrow, nodding to the reporter.","""At twelve thirty.""",Darrow nodded twice with great satisfaction.,Then quite deliberately he unfolded the paper and perused its contents.,Without change of expression he handed it to Hallowell.,"The latter read aloud:   ""TO THE PEOPLE: A traitor is among you--one who has betrayed you,   one and all, but whom you cherish to your bosoms as a viper.","I, who   am greater than you all, have laid my commands upon him, and he has   seen fit to disobey.",He is now in hiding among you.,This man must be   produced.,"I would not willingly harass you, but this, my will, must   be carried out.",If he is not found by six to-morrow a sign will be

to Jack, ""that settles it.",Everything's running like a catboat in a fair wind.,"He's in communication with us; he is gaining confidence in his inflated imaginary importance; we are to have a continuance of his peculiar activities; and we can put our hands on him at a moment's notice.""","""What!""","shouted Hallowell and Jack Warford, leaping to their feet.","""Where is he?""",demanded the reporter.,"""How do you know?""",cried Jack.,"Simmons, his head-piece laid aside, looked up at him in silent curiosity.","""It is sufficient for now that I do know,"" smiled Darrow.","""As for how I know, that last wireless proved it to me.""",All three men immediately bent over the message for a detailed perusal.,"After a minute's scrutiny, Hallowell looked up in disappointment.","""Too many for me,"" he confessed.","""What is there in that?""",But Darrow shook his head.,"""I play my own game,"" was all the explanation he would vouchsafe.","""You may as well knock off, old man,"" he told Simmons.","""I don't think there'll be anything more doing to-night; and it doesn't matter if there is.","Tell your other man to jot down anything from that sending, if any comes.","Now,"" he turned to Hallowell, ""I want to see your managing editor.""",The three took the subway to City Hall Square.,The managing editor received Darrow with much favor as the vehicle of a big scoop brought in far enough ahead of going to press to permit of ample time for its development.,"""Now, Mr. Curtis,"" said Darrow to this man, ""this is going to be an interesting week for you.",Here's your last exclusive despatch.,"From to-morrow morning every paper in town will naturally get every wireless that comes in.""","""H'm,"" observed Curtis, reading the despatch.","""What next?""","""He'll fulfil his threat.","To-morrow evening at six o'clock he will stop the vibrations either of light, of electricity, or of sound--probably of electricity, as he has appointed the rush hour.""","""Most likely,"" Curtis agreed.","""Warn the people to keep out of the subways, and not to get scared.",Take it easy.,There's no danger.,"Explain why in words of one syllable.""","""Sure.""","""Now, this is what I'm here for.",Up to now these manifestations have been harmless in their direct effects.,But follow the hypothesis to its logical conclusion.,"Suppose this man can arrest the vibrations not only of light and sound, but also of the third member of the vibratory trinity.","Suppose he should go one step farther; and, even for the barest fraction of time, should be able to stop the vibrations of heat!""",The managing editor half rose.,As the idea in its full significance gained hold on their imaginations the three men turned to stare blankly at one another.,"""That is annihilation!""",Curtis whispered.,"""On a wholesale scale,"" agreed Darrow calmly.","""It means the death of every living thing from the smallest insect to the largest animal, from the microbe to the very lichens on the stones of Trinity.","I agree with the way you look.""",He laughed a little.,"""But the case isn't so bad as it sounds,"" he went on.","""If the crust of the earth were to collapse, that would be annihilation, too.",But it isn't likely to happen.,"There are several things to think of.""","""What, for the love of Pete!""",gasped Curtis.,"""Any small efforts at muck-racking this refrigerator trust would be thankfully received.""","""In the first place, as you know,"" explained Darrow, ""his power seems to be limited in certain directions.",He apparently can stop vibrations only of certain defined wave-lengths at one time.,"It may be that he is unable to stop heat vibrations at all.""","""You'll have to do better than that,"" growled Curtis.","""The rest is faith--on your part,"" replied Darrow.","""For I'll guarantee that even if Monsieur X has this power, I'll stop him before he exercises it.""","""Guarantee?""",inquired Curtis.,"""There's nothing to prevent my moving to California or Mombassa if I thought myself in any danger here,"" Darrow pointed out.","""It would be very easy for me quietly to warn my friends and quietly do the grand sneak.""","""True,"" muttered Curtis, rummaging on his desk for a pipe.","""The danger isn't the point--_it's the fear of danger_,"" said Darrow.","Curtis looked up, arresting the operation of crowding the tobacco into the pipe bowl.","""Suppose that throughout the length and breadth of this city the idea should be spread broadcast that at any given moment it might be destroyed.","Can you imagine the effect?""","""Immediate exodus,"" grinned Curtis.","""Immediate is a nice dignified word,"" he added.","""Quite so, and then?""","""Eh?""","""What in blazes would four million city people without homes or occupations do?",Where would they go?,"What would happen?""","""You see what I mean,"" went on Darrow, after the slight pause necessary to let this sink in.","""The fear would bring about a general catastrophe only less serious than the fact itself.",It's up to you newspaper men to see that they don't catch this fear.,There'll be a hundred letters from foxy boys with just enough logic or imagination to see the possibility of cutting off the furnace; but without imagination enough to get the final effect of telling people about it.,Suppress it.,"Unless I'm mistaken, the affair will be over in a week.""",Curtis drummed thoughtfully on his desk.,"""It's got to be done, and it will be done,"" he said at last.","""I'll get to every paper in the city to-night--if it costs us our scoop.""","""But won't the people who write the letters tell about it, anyway?""",asked Jack.,"""And won't the outside papers have the same stuff?""","""Sure,"" agreed Curtis promptly, ""but what isn't in the city press doesn't get to the mass of the public; that's a cinch.",There will be some thousands or even tens of thousands who will leave; there'll be rumors a-plenty; there'll be the damnedest row since the Crusades--but the people will stick.,"I'm taking your word for the danger.""","""Well, I'm the hostage,"" Darrow reminded him.","""Correct,"" said Curtis, reaching for the desk telephone.",Hallowell followed the visitors to the narrow hall.,"""Now,"" said Darrow in parting, ""remember what I have said.","Don't mention my name nor indicate that there is anywhere an idea that the identity or whereabouts of Monsieur X is by anybody suspected.""","CHAPTER XV THE MASTER SPEAKS AGAIN Having thus detailed rather minutely the situation in which the city and the actors in its drama found themselves, it now becomes necessary to move the action forward to the point where the moneyed interests took a hand in the game.",That was brought about in somewhat more than fifty hours.,In the meantime the facts as to vibrations were published in all the papers; the despatches and the relations between McCarthy and Monsieur X exclusively in the _Despatch_--to that organ's vast satisfaction and credit; and the possibilities of tragedy in none.,This latter fact was greatly to the credit of a maligned class of men.,It is common belief that no cause is too sacred or no consequence too grave to give pause to the editorial rapacity for news.,The present instance disproved that supposition.,"No journal, yellow or otherwise, contained a line of suggestion that anything beyond annoyance was to be feared from these queer manifestations.",The consequences on a mixed population like that of New York were very peculiar.,The people naturally divided themselves into three classes.,"In the first were those who had received their warning from logic, friends, or the outside world; and who either promptly left town or, being unable to do so, lived in fear.","In the second were all that numerous body who, neurasthenically unbalanced or near the overbalance, shut instinctively the eyes of their reason and glowed with a devastating and fanatical religious zeal.","Among these, so extraordinarily are we constituted, almost immediately grew up various sects, uniting only in the belief that the wrath of God was upon an iniquitous people.","By far the largest class of all, comprising the every-day busy bulk of the people, were those who accepted the thing at its face value, read its own papers, went about its business, and spared time to laugh at the absurdities or growl at the inconveniences of the phenomena.","With true American adaptability, it speedily accustomed itself to both the expectation of, and the coping with, unusual conditions.","It went forth about its daily affairs; it started for home a little early in order to get there in season; it eschewed subways and theaters; it learned to wait patiently, when one of the three blights struck its world, as a man waits patiently for a shower to pass.","This class, as has been said, was preponderantly in the majority, but its mass was being constantly diminished as a little knowledge of danger seeped into its substance.","News of the possible catastrophe passed from mouth to mouth; a world outside, waiting aghast at such fatuity, began to get in its messages.",Street corner alarmists talked to such as would listen.,Thousands upon thousands left the city.,"Hundreds of thousands more, tied hard and fast by the strings of necessity, waited in an hourly growing dread.","The ""sign"" had been sent promptly at six o'clock, as promised.",It proved Darrow's prediction by turning out to be a stoppage of the electrical systems.,This time it lasted only half an hour-long enough to throw the traffic and transportation into confusion.,It was followed at short intervals by demonstrations in light and sound; none was of long duration.,"After the first few, their occurrence came freakishly, in flashes, as though the hidden antagonist delighted in confusing his immense audience.",The messages he sent over the wireless in the Atlas Building grew more and more threatening and grandiose.,They demanded invariably that McCarthy should be sought out and delivered up to a rather vaguely described vengeance; and threatened with dire calamities all the inhabitants of Manhattan if the Unknown's desires were not fulfilled.,These threats grew more definite in character as time went on.,"The effect of all this in the long run was, of course, confusion and instability.",People laughed or cursed; but they also listened and reasoned.,"Gradually, throughout the city, dread was extending the blackness of its terror.",A knowledge that would have caused a tremendous panic if it had been divulged suddenly now gave birth to a deep seated uneasiness.,"Where the panic would have torn men up by the roots and flung them in terrorized mobs through the congested ways and out into the inhospitable country, the uneasiness of dread held them cowering at their accustomed tasks.","They were afraid; but they had had time to think, and they realized what it would mean to leave their beloved or accustomed or necessary city, as the case might be.",And it must be remembered that the definite knowledge of what might be feared was not yet disseminated among them.,"But this attitude hurt business, and business struck back.",The subways were practically deserted; the theaters empty; the accustomed careless life of the Great White Way thinned; the streams of life slackened.,"Furthermore, the intelligent criminal immediately discovered that ideal shields were being provided him gratis behind which to conduct his crimes.","In the silence a man could blow out the side of a bank building with impunity, provided only he kept out of sight.","In the darkness he could pilfer at will, with only the proviso that he forget not his gum shoes.",The possibilities of night crime when electricity lacks have already been touched upon.,To meet unusual conditions the people individually and collectively rose to heights of forgotten ingenuity.,The physical life of a city is so well established that the average city dweller grows out of the pioneer virtue of adaptability.,"Now once more these people were forced to meet new and untried conditions, to guard against new dangers, new opposing forces.",In an incredibly short space of time they grew out of aimless panic.,"They learned to sit tight; to guard adequately their lives, their treasure, and even to a certain extent their time against undue loss.",In the meantime the moneyed powers had been prompt to act.,They did not intend to stand idly while their pockets were being picked by untoward circumstances; nor did they intend to continue indefinitely the unusual expenditures necessary to guard themselves against even a greater loss.,"As there seemed to be two men to find, they employed the best of detectives to search for McCarthy; and professor Eldridge, as the greatest living expert, to hunt down the Unknown.",Thus unexpectedly Eldridge found himself with definite backing in his strange duel with Darrow.,"It is now desirable to place before the reader samples of the messages sent by Monsieur X and received in the wireless office of the Atlas Building, after which we can proceed once more to follow out the sequence of events.","""TO THE PEOPLE: The sign has been sent you.",You must now believe.,"The traitor is among you, and you must hunt him down.","This is your   sacred duty, for I, your master, have laid it upon you.""",That was one of the first.,"After a round dozen of similar import, there came this:   ""TO THE PEOPLE: I, your master, am displeased with you.","The   visitations of darkness and of silence have been sent, but you have   heeded little.","I doubt not that ye search, as I have commanded, but   you do not realize to the full your sacred obligation.",You go about   your business and you carry on your affairs.,"Your business and your   affairs are not so important as these, my commands.",Beware lest you   draw down the wrath of the Lord's Anointed.,"I am patient with your   ignorance; but give heed.""","The last at present to which your attention is called came just before the events to be detailed:   ""TO THE PEOPLE: Your time is drawing short.",You are a stubborn and a   stiff-necked generation.,My patience is ebbing away.,"You have been   shown the power of my right hand, and you have gone your accustomed   ways.",You have defied the might of the Right Hand of God.,Now I will   lay on you my commands.,"""You must seek out Apollyon and deliver him even into my hands, and   that shortly.","I shall be patient yet a little while longer, for I   know that you grope in darkness and have not the light that shines   upon me.","But soon I shall strike.""",CHAPTER XVI THE PROFESSOR'S EXPERIMENT Throughout all this excitement Percy Darrow did absolutely nothing.,"He spent all his time, save that required for meals and the shortest necessary sleep, in a round-armed wooden chair in the wireless station of the Atlas Building.",Jack Warford sat with him.,"Darrow rarely opened his mouth for speech, but smoked slowly a few cigarettes, and rolled many more, which he held unlighted in the corner of his mouth until they dropped to pieces.","He watched quietly all that went on; glanced through such messages as came in from Monsieur X, read the papers, and dozed.","To reporters he was affable enough in his drawling slow fashion, but had nothing to say.","""Eldridge is doing this,"" he said to them; ""I'm only in the position of an interested spectator.""",Eldridge had taken hold in a thoroughly competent way.,"Back of the cold precision of his undoubted scientific attainments lurked, unexpected by most, a strong ambition and a less admirable hankering for the lime-light.","His opportunity to gratify all these appetites--science, advancement, and fame--was too good not to cause him the deepest satisfaction.","""I have determined,"" he told the reporters, ""that this particular instrument alone receives the messages from the unknown perpetrator.","Our investigations must be initiated, therefore, in this apartment.""","""How do you explain it?""",asked one of the reporters.,"""I can not explain it scientifically,"" admitted Eldridge, ""but I can surmise that the fact either purposely or accidentally has to do either with this instrument's location or with some slight and undetermined peculiarity of its tuning.""","""You could easily tell which by moving the instrument to another station where they aren't getting the messages now,"" suggested Darrow lazily.","""Certainly,"" snapped Eldridge, ""any child could deduce that.",But I fail to see the use or necessity for the determination at all unless in a spirit of frivolous play.,"Our task is not to discover where the messages can be received, but whence they are sent.""",He gazed frostily at the man who had interrupted him.,Darrow smiled softly back.,"""How far will your instrument carry in sending?""",Eldridge asked Simmons.,"""Its extreme is about two hundred miles.""","""Then we can safely assume that a circle drawn with a two-hundred-mile radius would contain this man you call Monsieur X""--the newspapers had adopted Darrow's nickname for the Unknown--""since you have succeeded in communicating with him.""","""Marvelous,"" said Darrow to Jack--but under his breath.","""As the sending of Monsieur X is faint, it follows that he is somewhere near the periphery of this circle, or that he is possessed of a primitive or weak instrument.","By the doctrine of probabilities we should be justified in concluding against the latter supposition.""","""How's that, Professor?""",asked the _Morning Register_ man.,"""It doesn't get to me.""","""He is evidently a man not only of scientific attainments, but of immense scientific possessions--as is evidenced by these phenomenal results he is able to accomplish.",But we are not justified in reasoning according to the doctrine of probabilities.,"Therefore, we shall proceed methodically.","I have already made my preparations.""",Eldridge looked about him with an air of triumph.,"""I am fortunate enough to have, in the present crisis, unlimited financial backing,"" he said.","""Therefore, I am in a position to carry out the most exhaustive of experiments.""","He stretched his hand out for a long roll, which he laid flat upon the table, pinning down the corners.","""Here is a map of the Eastern States,"" said he.","""I have drawn a circle on it with a two-hundred-miles radius.",At this moment a private instrument with a full crew to string sending and receiving wires is two hundred miles from here on the New York Central Railroad.,"It has for its transportation a private train, and it will be given a clear right of way.""",He turned to Simmons.,"""Have you found yourself able to communicate with this Monsieur X at any time?""","""Communicate!""",echoed Simmons.,"""Why, he's easier to talk to than a girl who wants an ice-cream soda!""","""Then send this: 'Your messages have been communicated to the people.","Be patient.'""",Simmons touched the key.,The spark leaped crashing.,"""What do you get?""","asked Eldridge, after a moment.","""Oh, a lot of the same sort of dope,"" answered Simmons wearily.","""Do you want it?""","""No, it is not necessary,"" replied Eldridge.","""But listen for another message from about the same distance when he has finished.""",Silence fell on the room.,At the end of ten minutes Simmons raised his head.,"""I get 'O K Q' over and over,"" said he.","""Want that?""","""That,"" replied Eldridge with satisfaction, ""indicates that my crew on the special train in the Adirondacks two hundred miles away has heard your message to Monsieur X.""",He glanced at his watch.,"""Now, if you would be so good as to afford me a moment's assistance,"" he requested Simmons, ""I wish to disconnect from your battery one of your powerful Leyden jars, and to substitute for it one of weaker voltage.","I ventured to instruct my delivery man to leave a few in the outer hall.""","""That will weaken the sending power of my instrument,"" objected Simmons.","""Exactly what I wish to do,"" replied Eldridge.","""He's clever all right,"" Darrow murmured admiringly to Jack.","""See what he's up to?""","""Not yet,"" muttered Jack.","The substitution completed, Eldridge again glanced at his watch.","""Now,"" he instructed Simmons, ""send the letters 'Q E D,' and continue to do so until you again hear the letters 'O K Q.'""",Simmons set himself to the task.,It was a long one.,At last he reported his answer.,"""He sends 'O K Q ten,'"" he said.",Eldridge turned to the reporters.,"""That means that the substitution of the smaller Leyden jar for one of the larger reduced the sending power of this instrument just ten miles,"" said he.","""My crew has quite simply moved slowly forward until it caught our sending here.""","""Next,"" he instructed Simmons, ""see if you can communicate with Monsieur X.""",The operator speedily reported his success at that.,Eldridge removed his glasses and polished their lenses.,"""Thus, gentlemen,"" said he, ""from our circle of two-hundred-mile radius we have eliminated a strip ten miles wide.","Naturally if this weakened sending reaches only one hundred and ninety miles, and our antagonist receives our messages, he must be nearer than one hundred and ninety miles.","We will now further reduce the strength of our sending and try again.""","The younger men present broke into a shout, ""Good work!""",somebody cried.,"They crowded about, keenly interested in this new method of man-hunting.","Only Darrow, tipped back in his chair against the wall, seemed unexcited.",To Jack's whispered question he shook his head.,"""It's ingenious,"" he acknowledged, ""but he's on the wrong track.""","That was as far as he would explain, and soon dropped into a slight doze.",Throughout the greater part of the night the experiment continued.,Battery by battery the sending power of the instrument was weakened.,"Mile by mile the special train drew nearer until, by catching the prearranged signal, it determined just how far the new sending reached.",Then Simmons tried Monsieur X.,"As the latter invariably answered, it was, of course, evident that he remained still in the narrowing zone of communication.","It was fascinating work, like the drawing of a huge invisible net.",The reporters on the morning papers mastered only with difficulty their inclination to stay.,"They had to leave before their papers went to press, but were back again in an hour, unwilling to lose a moment of the game.",A tension vibrated the little office.,"Only Percy Darrow dozed alone in the corner, leaning back in his wooden armchair.",At near four o'clock in the morning Simmons raised his head after a long bout of calling to announce that he could get no reply from Monsieur X.,"""He's got tired of your fool messages,"" remarked the _Register_ man.","""And I don't wonder!","Guess he's gone to bed.""","Eldridge said nothing, but replaced the Leyden jar he had but just removed.","""Try one,"" said he.","""I get him,"" reported Simmons, after a moment.","""Send him anything plausible and reassuring,"" commanded Eldridge hastily.",He turned to his small and attentive audience in triumph.,"""Thus, gentlemen,"" he announced, ""we have proven conclusively that our man is located between forty and fifty miles from New York.","If we draw two circles, with this building as center, the circumference of one of which is fifty, the other forty miles away, we define the territory within which the malefactor in question is to be found.""",The people in the room crowded close about the table to examine the map upon which Professor Eldridge had drawn the circles.,"""There's an awful lot of country--some of it pretty wild,"" objected the _Bulletin_ man.","""It will be a long job to hunt a man down in that territory.""","""Even if it were as extensive a task as a hasty review of the facts might indicate,"" stated Eldridge, ""I venture to assert that enough men would be forthcoming to expedite such a search.","But modifying circumstances will lighten the task.""","""How's that?""","asked the _Banner_ man, speaking for the others' evident interest.","""We have no means of surmising the method by which this man succeeds in arresting vibratory motions of certain wave-lengths,"" said Eldridge didactically, ""any more than we are able to define the precise nature of electricity.","But, as in the case of electricity, we can observe the action of its phenomena.",Two salient features leap out at us: one is that these phenomena are limited in time; the other that they are limited in space.,"The latter aspect we will examine, if you please, gentlemen.","""The phenomena have been directed with great accuracy (a) at the Atlas Building; (b) at this city and some of its immediate suburbs.",The peculiarity of this can not but strike an observant mind.,"How is this man able, at forty or fifty miles distance, to concentrate his efforts on one comparatively small objective?",We can only surmise some system of insulating screens or focal mirrors.,I might remark in passing that the existence of this power to direct or focus the more rapid ethereal vibrations would be a discovery of considerable scientific moment.,"But if this is the method employed, why do we not cut a band of vibratory nullifications, rather than touch upon a focal point?""","""Repeat softly,"" murmured the irrepressible _Register_ man.","""Why,"" explained Eldridge patiently, ""are not the people and buildings between here and the unknown operator affected?",The only hypothesis we are justified in working upon is that the man's apparatus is at a height sufficient to carry over intervening obstacles.,This hypothesis is strengthened by the collateral fact that the territory we have just determined as that within which he must be found lies in the highlands of our own and neighboring states.,"We may, therefore, eliminate the low-lying districts within our radius.""",Percy Darrow opened one eye.,"""Perhaps he's up in a balloon,"" he drawled languidly; ""better take along an aeroplane.""",Eldridge cast on him a look of cold scorn.,Darrow closed the eye.,"CHAPTER XVII DRAWING THE NET The ""zone of danger"", as the _Bulletin_ named it, was immediately the scene of swarming activities.","Besides the expedition immediately despatched by the interests backing the investigation, several enterprising newspapers saw a fine chance for a big scoop, and sent out much-heralded parties of their own.","The activities of these were well reported, you may be sure.",Public interest was at once focused reassuringly on the chances of finding the annoying malefactor to-day or to-morrow; there no longer existed a doubt that he would be found.,"The weight of dread was lifted, and in the reaction people made light of the inconveniences and fun of the menacing messages that now came in by the dozen.","[Illustration: ""Let Eldridge do his best.""]",It was necessary to take extraordinary precautions against thieves and fire; the people took them.,It was needful to slacken business in order that the congestion of the rush hour might not again prove tragic; business was slackened.,"People were willing to undergo many things, because, after all, they were but temporary.",The madman of the Catskills would sooner or later be found; his pernicious activities brought to a conclusion.,"The country to be searched was tremendous, of course, but the search was thorough.","The public delivered itself joyously to a debauch of rumors and of ""extras"".","The insistent alarms of danger, trickling in slowly from the outside world, dried up in the warmth of optimism.","Only the more thoughtful, to a few of whom these warnings came, coupled them with Monsieur X's repeated threats, and walked uncertain and in humility.","Percy Darrow did not interest himself in the search, nor did he desert his post in the wireless office.",There he did nothing whatever.,"Jack Warford stayed with him, but immensely bored, it must be confessed.","Once he suggested that if Darrow had nothing for him to do that afternoon, he thought he would like to go out for a little exercise.",Darrow shook his head.,"""You may go, if you want to, Jack,"" said he, ""but if you do I'll have to get some one else.","This isn't much of a job, but I may need you any moment.""","""All right,"" agreed Jack cheerfully.","""Only I wish you'd let a fellow know what to expect.""",Darrow shook his head.,The two now practically lived in the office.,Neither had taken his clothes off for several days.,They slept in their chairs or on the lounge.,"Darrow read the various messages from the Unknown, glanced over the newspapers, and dozed.",Thus there passed two days of the search.,On the third day the intermittent phenomena and the messages suddenly ceased.,This fact was hailed jubilantly by all the papers as indicating that at last the quarry had become alarmed by the near-coming search.,"From the contracted district still remaining to be combed over, nobody was permitted to depart; and so closely was the cordon drawn by so large a posse that it was physically impossible for any living being to slip by the line.","Thus even if Monsieur X, convinced that at last his discovery was imminent, should destroy his apparatus or attempt to move it and himself to a place of safety, he would find his escape cut off.","Thousands of men were employed, and thousands more drafted in as volunteers to render this outcome assured.",It was an army deployed in an irregular circle and moving inward toward its center.,"Men of the highest executive ability commanded it, saw to its necessary deliberation, eliminated all possibility of a confusion through which any man could slip.","The occasion was serious, and it was taken seriously.",Of the outcome no one in touch with the situation had a moment's doubt.,The messages and the phenomena had continued to come from the danger zone.,It was of course evident that they could not have been sent from any portion of the zone actually searched and occupied by the searchers.,"The remaining portion of the zone, from which they were still coming, had been completely surrounded.",After that the manifestations had ceased.,"Therefore, Monsieur X must be within the beleaguered circle.","To add to the probabilities, as Eldridge pointed out, the remaining district compassed the highest hills in the zone--a fact on all fours with his hypothesis.",On the appointed morning the army moved toward the center.,"Men beat the ground carefully, so close to one another that they could touch hands.","As they closed in, the ranks became thicker.","Animals of many kinds, confused as the ranks closed in on them, tried to break through the cordon and were killed.","Captains held order in the front row, that the army might not become a crowd.","Birds, alarmed by the shouting, rose and wheeled.",In the city immense crowds watched the bulletins sent momently from the very field itself by private wires strung hastily for the occasion.,"Enterprising journals had prepared huge rough maps, on which the contracting circle was indicated by red lines, constantly redrawn.",It was discovery before a multitude.,"The imagination of the public, fired by its realization of this fact, stretched itself ahead of the distant beaters, bodying forth what they might find.",As the circle narrowed excitement grew.,All business ceased.,The streets were crowded; the windows of the buildings looking out on the numerous bulletin-boards were black with heads.,Those who could not see demanded eagerly of those who could.,In the Atlas Building the wireless operator hung out of his window.,Beside him was Jack Warford.,Darrow declined to join them.,"""You tell me,"" said he.",Jack therefore reported back over his shoulder the bulletins as they appeared.,"The crowds below read them, their faces upturned.","One ran:   ""Cordon now has surrounded the crest of the Knob.",Station of   Monsieur X determined among oak-trees.,Men halted.,"Picket company   surrounds.""",The crowd roared its appreciation and impatience.,A long pause followed.,"Then came the next bulletin:   ""Search discovers nothing.""","A puzzled angry murmur arose, confused and chopped, like cross currents in a tideway.","Finally this was hung out:   ""No traces of human occupancy.""",A moment's astonished pause ensued.,"Then, over the vast multitude, its faces upturned in incredulous amazement; over the city lying sparkling in the noonday sun fell the pall of absolute darkness.",In the wireless office of the Atlas Building Percy Darrow laughed.,CHAPTER XVIII CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED The absolute failure of Eldridge's hypothesis immediately threw public confidence into a profound reaction.,Certainty gave place to complete distrust.,Rumor gained ground.,The exodus increased.,"Where formerly only those who could do so without great sacrifice or inconvenience had left town, now people were beginning to cut loose at any cost.","Men resigned their positions in order to get their families away; others began to arrange their affairs as best they might, as though for a long vacation.","As yet panic had not appeared openly in the light of day, but she lurked in the shadows of men's hearts.",The railroads and steamboats were crowded beyond their capacity.,Extra trains followed one another as close together as the block signals would allow them to run.,Humanity packed the cars.,It was like a continual series of football days.,In three of them it was estimated that two hundred thousand people had left Manhattan.,It would have been physically impossible for the transportation lines to have carried a thousand more.,They had reached their capacity; the spigot was wide open.,Percy Darrow showed Jack the head-lines to this effect.,"""Cheerful thought,"" he suggested.","""Suppose the whole four million should want to get out at the same time!""",Eldridge had come back to the wireless office thoroughly bewildered.,"It is a well-known fact that the exact scientist is the hardest man to fool, but the most fooled if fooled at all.",Witness the extent to which noted scientists have been taken in by faking spiritualist mediums.,So with Eldridge.,His hypothesis had been so carefully worked out that the failure of its logic threw his mind into confusion.,"Until he could discover the weak link in his chain of reasoning, that confusion must continue.","An hour and a half after the bulletin announcing the failure of the search had been posted, Eldridge rushed into the wireless office.",The plague of darkness had lifted after fifteen minutes' duration.,"""Call Monsieur X,"" he gasped to the day operator.","In fifteen minutes, by rapid substitutions of batteries to weaken or strengthen the sending current, he had redetermined his previous data.","Apparently, without the shadow of a doubt, Monsieur X was within the circle.","""He may be at sea,"" suggested the operator.",But Eldridge shook his head.,"The circle of the sea had been well patrolled, and for days.","""Begin over again,"" drawled Darrow.","""I told you that you were on the wrong track.""",Eldridge glanced at him.,"""I can't say that you've done much!""",said he tartly.,"""No?""","queried Darrow, with one of his slow and exasperating smiles.","""Perhaps not.",But you'd better get to thinking.,You won't be able always to take things easy.,"You may have to hustle before long.""","""There has been, I admit,"" said Eldridge stiffly, repeating in substance the interview he had already given out, ""some flaw in our chain of reasoning.",This it will be necessary to review with the object of revision.,Every physical manifestation must have some physical and definite cause; and this can be found if time enough is bestowed on it.,"Often the process of elimination is the only method by which the truth can be determined.""",Darrow chuckled.,"""Look out the process of elimination doesn't overtake you,"" he remarked.","Eldridge detailed the same reasoning, at greater length, to the men who had employed him.",These were very impatient.,"Business was being not merely impeded, but destroyed.",Their customers had no time for them; their employees were in many cases leaving their jobs.,"They called in all the help they could to assist Eldridge's speculations, but in the end they had to fall back on the scientist as the best on the market.","The case was not left in his hands alone, however.",After a meeting they offered a reward to any one discovering and putting to an end the disconcerting phenomena.,"""Here's where we make money, Jack, big money,"" observed Darrow when he read this offer.","""It'll be bigger before we get through.","You and I can have the little expedition to Volcano Island.""","""Nothing suits me better,"" said Jack.","""Are you sure we'll get it?""","""Sure,"" said Darrow.",Monsieur X had of course honored the waiting world with a message.,"It followed the fifteen minutes of darkness:   ""TO THE PEOPLE: I have been patient and have stayed my hand in order   that you may learn the vanity of your endeavor.",Who are ye that ye   shall strive to take me?,Vanity and foolishness is your portion.,Now   ye know my power and ye will listen unto my words as to the words of   the Master.,Ye must hunt down this man McCarthy and deliver him over   unto me.,"If every one of you gives himself to the task,

only activity in the city was that bent on seeking out the abiding-place of Monsieur X.

at times somewhat beyond the end of the fifty-mile radius.,Eldridge immediately undertook a series of more delicate experiments by means of indicators especially designed by him for the occasion.,Once more the little wireless office became the focus of repertorial attention.,"""Our major premises we find still to be correct,"" announced Eldridge in the coldly didactic manner characteristic of the man.","""This unknown operator is at a distance;
