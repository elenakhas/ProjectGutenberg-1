No sound came from the woods.,The singing of the birds and the faint sound of the woods had gone.,But when Miriam left her room to go across to the schoolroom and wait for the children she found the spring in the house.,The landing was bright with the light streaming through many open doors.,Rooms were being prepared.,On a large tray on the landing table lay a mass of spring flowers and little flowered bowls of many shapes and sizes filled with fresh water.,"Stokes and Wiggerson were fluttering in and out of the rooms carrying frilled bed-linen, lace-edged towels and flowered bed-spreads.",People with money could make the spring come as soon as the days lengthened.,"Clear bright rooms, bright clean paint, soft coloured hangings, spring flowers in the bright light on landings.",The warmth from stoves and fires seemed as if it came from the sun.,Its glow changed suddenly to the glow of sunlight.,It drew the scent of the flowers into the air.,And with the new scent of the new flowers something was moving and leaping and dancing in the air.,Outside the wintry weather might go on and on as though the spring would never come.,In a dull cheap villa there might be a bunch of violets in a bowl on a whatnot.,Snuffing very close you could feel the tide of spring wash through your brain.,But only in the corner where the violets were.,In cold rooms upstairs you could remember the violets and the spring; but the spring did not get into the house.,There was an extraordinary noise going on downstairs.,Standing inside the schoolroom door Miriam listened.,"Joey's contralto laugh coming up in gusts, the sound of dancing feet, the children shouting names, Mrs. Corrie repeating them in her laughing wavering chalky voice.",Joey; certainly Joey was not dancing about.,"She was probably sitting on the sofa watching them, and thinking.",Fancy their being so excited about people coming.,Just like any ordinary people.,She went into the schoolroom saying over the names to herself.,"""Mélie to-day ... Dad and Mr. Staple-Craven to-morrow ... the Bean-pole for Sunday"" ... someone they knew very well.",It might be either a tall man or a tall woman....,They made the house spring-like because people were coming.,Would the people notice that the house was spring-like?,Would they _realise_?,People did not seem to realise anything.,They would patronise the flowers ... they ought to feel wild with joy; join hands and dance round the flowers.,"At lunch time the door at the far end of the dining-room stood open showing the shrouded length of a billiard-table, and beyond it at the far end in the gloom a squat oak chimney-piece littered with pipes and other small objects.","The light, even from the overcast sky, came in so brilliantly that the holland cover looked almost white.",There must be several windows; perhaps three.,"What a room to have, just for a billiard-room.","A quiet, mannish room, waiting until it was wanted, the pockets of the table bulging excitingly under the cover, the green glass supports under the squat round stoutly spindling legs, a bit of a huge armchair showing near the fireplace, the end of a sofa, the green shaded lamps low over the table, the dark untidy mantelpiece, tobacco, books, talks, billiards.",In there too the spring flowers stood ready on the table.,"They would be put somewhere on the wide dark mantel, probably on a corner out of the way.","""We used to play table billiards at home,"" said Miriam at random, longing to know what part the billiard-room played in the week-end.","""Billy-billy,"" said Mrs. Corrie, ""oh, we'll have some fun.","We'll _all_ play.""","""It was _such_ a bore stretching the webbing,"" said Miriam critically, avoiding Sybil's eager eyes.","""It _must_ have been--but how awfully jolly to have billiards.","I simply adaw billiards,"" said Joey fervently.","""Such a fearful business getting them absolutely taut,"" pursued Miriam, feeling how much the cream caramel was enhanced by the sight of the length, beyond the length of the dining-room, of that bright long heavy room.",She imagined it lit and people walking about amongst the curious lights and shadows with cues--and cigarettes; quiet intent faces.,Englishmen.,Did the English invent billiards?,"""Poor old Joey.",Wish you weren't going to the dentist.,"You won't be here when Mélie comes.""","""Don't mind the dentist a scrap.",I'm looking forward to it.,"I shall see Mélie to-night.""","She doesn't like her, thought Miriam; people being together is awful; like the creaking of furniture.",2 Mélie arrived an hour before dinner time.,Miriam heard Mrs. Corrie taking her into the room next to her own with laughter and many phrases.,"A panting, determined voice, like a voice out of a play, the thick, smooth, rather common voice of a fair-haired middle-aged lady in a play kept saying, ""The pores, my dear.",I must open my pores after the journey.,"I'm _choked_ with it.""",Presently Mélie's door closed and Mrs. Corrie tapped and put her head inside Miriam's door.,"""She's goin' to have a steam bath on her floor, got an injarubber tent on the floor and a spirit lamp.",She's gettin' inside it.,"Isn't she an old _cure_!""","""She's thinking more about her food than anything they're saying; she doesn't really care about them a bit,"" thought Miriam at dinner, gazing again and again across at Mrs. Staple-Craven's fat little shape seated opposite herself in a tightly fitting pale blue silk dress whose sleeves had tiny puffs instead of the fashionable large square sleeves.","Watching her cross unconscious face, round and blue-eyed and all pure ""milk and roses,"" her large yellow head with a tiny twist of hair standing up like the handle of a jug, exactly on the top of the crown, her fat white hands with thick soft curly fingers and bright pink nails, the strange blue stare that went from thing to thing on the table, hearing her thick smooth heedless voice, with its irrelevant assertions and statements, Miriam wondered how she had come to be Mrs. Staple-Craven.",She was no more Mrs. Staple-Craven than she was sitting at Mrs. Corrie's table.,She was not really there.,"She was just getting through, and neither Mrs. Corrie nor Joey really knew this.",At the same time she was too stout and gluttonous to be still really a fairy in Devonshire.,Where was she?,What did she think?,She went on and on because she was afraid someone might ask her that.,Although Joey had been to have her hair dyed and had not been to the dentist at all she was not pretending nearly so much.,She was a little ashamed.,"Why had she said she was going to the dentist and come back with sheeny bronzy hair, ashamed?",She had been worrying about her looks.,Perhaps she was more than twenty-one.,"Nan Babington said no one need mind being twenty-one if they were engaged, but if not it was a frantic age to be.","Joey was a poor worried thing, just like any other girl.",3 When they were safely ensconced round the drawing-room fire Mrs. Staple-Craven sat very upright in her chair with her plump little hands on either arm and her eyes fixed on the blaze.,Joey pleading toothache had said good night and gone away with her coffee.,There was a moment's silence.,"""You'd never think I'd been fairly banged to death by the spirits last night,"" said Mrs. Staple-Craven in a thick flat reproachful narrative tone.","It sounds like a housekeeper giving an order to a servant she knows won't obey her, thought Miriam, swishing more comfortably into her chair.",If Mrs. Craven would talk there would be no need to do anything.,"""Ah-ha,"" said Mrs. Craven, still looking at the fire, ""something's pleasing Miss Henderson.""","""Is she rejoicin'?","Tell us about the spirits, Mélie.",I'm deadly keen.,Deadly.,She mustn't be too delighted.,"I've told her she's not to get engaged.""","""Engaged?""","enquired Mrs. Craven, of the fire.","""She's promised,"" said Mrs. Corrie, turning off the lights until only one heavily shaded lamp was left, throwing a rosy glow over Mélie's compact form.","""She won't, if she's not under the star, to be sure.""","""Oh, she mustn't think about stars.","Why should she marry?""",Miriam looked a little anxiously from one to the other.,"""You've shocked her, Julia,"" said Mrs. Staple-Craven.","""Never mind at all, my dear.","You'll marry if you're under the star.""","""Star, star, beautiful star, a handsome one with twenty thousand a year,"" sang Mrs. Corrie.","""I don't think a man has any right to be handsome,"" said Miriam desperately--she must manage to keep the topic going.",These women were so terrible--they filled her with fear.,She must make them take back what they had said.,"""A handsome man's much handsomer than a pretty woman,"" said Mrs. Craven.","""It's cash, cash, cash--that's what it is,"" chanted Mrs. Corrie softly.","""Oh, do you?""",said Miriam.,"""I think a handsome man's generally so weak.""",Mrs. Craven stared into the fire.,"""You take the one who's got the ooftish, my friend,"" said Mrs. Corrie.","""But you say I'm not to marry.""","""You shall marry when my poor little old kiddies are grown up.","We'll find you a very nice one with plenty of money.""","""Then you _don't_ think marriage is a failure,"" said Miriam, with immense relief.",Mrs. Corrie leaned towards her with laughter in her clear light eyes.,It seemed to fill the room.,"""Have some more coffy-drink?""","""No, thanks,"" said Miriam, shivering.","""Sing us something--she sings, Mélie--German songs.","Isn't she no end clever?""","""Does she?""",said Mrs. Craven.,"""Yes.",She's got a singing chin.,"Sing us a pretty song, my dear.""","As she fluttered the leaves of her Schumann album she saw Mrs. Craven sit back with closed eyes, and Mrs. Corrie still sitting forward in her chair with her hands clasped on her knees gazing with a sad white face into the flames.","""Ich grolle nicht, und wenn das Herz auch bricht,"" sang Miriam, and thought of Germany.",Her listeners did not trouble her.,They would not understand.,"No English person would quite understand--the need, that the Germans understood so well--the need to admit the beauty of things ... the need of the strange expression of music, making the beautiful things more beautiful and of words when they were together in the beauty of the poems.",Music and poetry told everything--whether you understood the music or the words--they put you in the mood that made things shine--then heart-break or darkness did not matter.,Things go on shining in the end; German landscapes and German sunshine and German towns were full of this knowledge.,In England there was something besides--something hard.,"""'Menjous, ain't it?""","said Mrs. Corrie, as she rose from the piano.","""If we lived aright we should all be singing,"" said Mrs. Craven, ""it's natural.""","4 ""You look a duck.""",Miriam stood still at the top of the stairs and looked down into the hall.,Mrs. Staple-Craven was standing under the largest lamp near the fireplace looking up at a tall man in a long ulster.,"Grizzled hair and a long face with a long pointed grizzled beard--she was staring up at him with her eyes ""like saucers"" and her face pink, white, gold, ""like a full moon""--how awful for him ... he'd come down from town probably in a smoking carriage, talking, and there she was and he had to say something.","""I've just had my bath,"" said Mrs. Craven, without altering the angle of her gaze.","""You look a duck,"" said the tall man fussily, half turning away.","Standing with his back to the couple, opening letters at the hall table was a little man in a neat little overcoat with a silk hat tilted back on his head.","His figure had a curious crooked jaunty appearance, the shoulders a little crooked and the little legs slightly bent.","""It's Mr. Corrie,"" mused Miriam, moving backwards as he turned and went swiftly out banging the front door behind him.","""He looks like a jockey""; she got herself back into her room until the hall should be clear.","""He's gone down to the stables.""",She listened to the quick jerky little footsteps crunching along the gravel outside her window.,Soon after the quick little steps sounded on the stairs and the children shouted from their rooms.,A door was opened and shut and for five minutes there was a babel of voices.,Then the steps came out again and went away down the passage leading off the landing to the bathroom and a little spare room at the further end.,They passed the bathroom and the door of the little room was opened and shut and locked.,"Everything was silent in the house, but from the room next to hers came the sounds of Mr. Craven plunging quickly about and blowing and clearing his throat.",She had not heard him come up.,When at last she came downstairs she found the whole party standing talking in the hall.,"The second gong was drowning the terrible voices, leaving nothing but gesticulating figures.","Presently Mr. Staple-Craven was standing before her with Mrs. Corrie, and her hand was powerfully wrung and released with a fussy emphatic handshake cancelling the first impression.","Mr. Craven made some remark in a high voice, lost by Miriam as Mr. Corrie came across to her from talking to Joey under a lamp and took her hand.","""Let me introduce your host,"" he said, keeping her hand and placing it on his arm as he turned towards the dining-room, ""and take you in to dinner.""","Miriam went across the hall past the servants waiting on either side of the dining-room door and down the long room with her hand on the soft coat sleeve of a neat little dinner jacket and her footsteps led by the firm, disconnected, jumpy footsteps of the little figure at her side.",There was a vague crowd of people coming along behind.,"""Come on, everybody,"" Mrs. Corrie had pealed delicately, and Mrs. Craven had said in a thick smooth explanatory voice, ""Of course she's the greatest stranger.""","The table was set with replicas of the little groups of Venetian wine and finger glasses and fine silver and cutlery that had accompanied Miriam's first sense of dining and when she found herself seated at Mr. Corrie's left hand opposite Mrs. Craven, with Joey away on her left, facing Mr. Craven and Mrs. Corrie now far away from her at the door end of the table, it seemed as if these things had been got together only for the use of the men.",Why were women there?,Why did men and women dine together?,"She would have liked to sit there and watch and listen, but not to dine--not to be seen dining by Mr. Corrie.","It was extraordinary, this muddle of men and women with nothing in common.",The men must hate it.,She knew he did not have such thoughts.,"All the decanters stood in a little group between him and the great bowl of flaring purple and crimson anemones that stood in the centre of the table, and the way in which he said when her soup came, ""Have some Moselle,"" and filled her glass, compelled her to feel welcome to share the ritual of the feast.","She sat with bent head wrapped and protected, hearing nothing as the voices sounded about the table but the clear sweet narrow rather drawling tones of Mr. Corrie's voice.","She could hear it talking to men, on racecourses, talking in clubs, laughing richly, rather drunkenly, at improper stories in club smoking-rooms; dining, talking and lunching, dining, talking, talking every day and sitting there now, wonderfully, giving her security.",She knew with perfect certainty that nothing painful or disagreeable or embarrassing could come near her in his presence.,But he knew nothing about her; much less than Wiggerson knew.,"5 Joey felt the same, of course.",But Joey was laughing and talking in her deep voice and making eyes.,"No, it was not the same.",Joey was not happy.,These people sitting at his table were supposed to be friends.,But they knew nothing about him.,He made little quiet mocking jokes and laughed and kept things going.,The Staple-Cravens knew nothing at all about him.,Mrs. Staple-Craven did not care for anybody.,She looked about and always spoke as if she were answering an accusation that nobody had made--a dressmaker persuading you to have something and talking on and on in fat tones to prevent your asking the price.... Mr. Craven only cared for himself.,He was weak and pompous and fussy with a silly elaborate chivalrous manner.,There was a stillness round the table.,Miriam felt that it centred in her and was somehow her fault.,Never mind.,She had successfully got through whitebait and a quail.,"She would write home about the quails and whitebait and the guests and say nothing about her own silence--""Mr. Staple-Craven is a poet ...""

she could almost hear the humming of the bees, and flung back the bead curtain with unseeing eyes half expecting some doorway to open on the remembered garden; the scent was overpowering ... the drawing-room was cool and silent with closed windows and drawn blinds; bowls of roses stood in every available place; she tiptoed about in the room gathering their scent.",As she opened the hall door Mrs. Corrie's voice startled her from the dining-room.,Going into the dining-room she found her with a flushed face and excited eyes and the children dancing round her.,"""Another tin!","One more tin!""","they exclaimed, plucking at Miriam.",From the billiard-room came the smell of fresh varnish.,Wiggerson was on her knees near the door.,"""She's done some stupid thing,"" thought Miriam, looking at Mrs. Corrie's excited, unconscious face with sudden anxiety; ""some womanish overdoing it, wanting to do too much and spoiling everything.""",She felt as if she were representing Mr. Corrie.,"""Will it be dry in time?""","she asked, half angrily, scarcely knowing what she said and in the midst of Mrs. Corrie's apologetic petition that she would bring a tin of oak stain back with her.","""Lordy, don't you think so?""","whispered Mrs. Corrie, only half dismayed.","Miriam had not patience to follow her as she went to survey the floor ruefully chanting, ""Oh, Wiggerson, Wiggerson.""","""Anyhow I'm sure it oughtn't to have any more on as late as when I come back,"" she scolded boldly.","How annoyed Mr. Corrie would be....                                    5 As she was going down the quiet road past the high oak garden palings of the nearest house she heard the bumping and scrabbling of a heavy body against the palings and a dog leapt into the road almost at her feet, making the dust fly.",It was an Irish terrier.,"It smiled and barked a little, waiting, looking up into her face and up and down the road.","""It thought it knew me,"" she pondered; ""it mistook me for someone else.""","She patted its head and went forward thinking of the joyful scrabbling, its headlong determination.","The dog jerked back its head with a wide smile, tore down the road and came back leaping and smiling.","Something disappeared from the vista of the roadway as the dog rushed along it nosing after scents, looking round now and again, and now and again rushing back to greet her.",It brought back the sense of the house and the strange gay life she had just left to go on her errand to the little unknown town.,It wore a smart collar; it belonged to that life.,People in it were never alone; when they went out there was always a dog with them.,"""It thinks I'm one of them.""",But it liked the wild; when they came out on to the common it rushed up a sandy pathway and disappeared amongst the gorse bushes.,"For a while Miriam hoped it would come back and kept looking about for it; then she gave it up and went ahead with the commons drifting slowly by on either side; she wished that the action of walking were not so jerky, that the expanses on either side might pass more smoothly and easily by: ""that's why people drive,"" she thought; ""you can only really see the country when you are not moving yourself.""","Standing still for a moment she looked across the open stretch to her left and smiled at it and went on again, walking more quickly; the soft beauty that had retreated to the horizon when the dog was with her was spreading back again across the whole expanse and coming towards her; she hurried on singing softly at random, ""Scorn such a _foe_ ... though I could fell thee at a blow, though I-i, cou-uld fe-ell thee-ee a-at a-a _blow_"" ... people walking and thinking and fussing, people driving somewhere in victorias were always coming along the road, to them it was a sort of suburb, quite ordinary, the bit near home.","But it was big enough to be full of waves and waves of something real, something cool and true and unchanging.","Had anybody seen it, did the people who lived there know it?",Did anybody know this strange thing?,"She almost ran;

before she reached the end of the long road the sandy pathways were beginning to glare.,"There was the river and the little bridge and the first shop just beyond it, where her purchase was to be made.",Its wood-work was very bright white; it had a seaside look.,She stood still on the slight ascent of the bridge mopping her face and preparing to represent Mrs. Corrie in the shop.,Scrambling up the shallow bank from the common came the yellow dog.,"""Oh, hooray--you duck,"" she breathed, patting the warm stubbly head and listening to his breathless snortings.",A piano-organ broke into loud music in the little street.,"It was not a mysterious little town, there was nothing of the village about it.",The white framed windows held things you would see in a Regent Street confectioner's; it was a special shop for the kind of people who lived here.,"Miriam felt for her three and six and asked for her pound of coffee creams with a bored air, wishing she knew the dog's name so that she could claim him familiarly.","She contented herself with telling him to lie down in an angry whisper repeatedly, as the creams were being weighed.",He stood panting and gazing at her wagging his stump.,"""'Ullo, Bushy,"" said the shopwoman languidly; the dog faced round panting more loudly.","""There you are, Bush,"" she said, as the scales balanced, and flung the dog a chocolate wafer which he caught with a snap.","Miriam gazed vaguely at the unfamiliar spectacle, angrily feeling that the shopwoman was observing her.","""You're not going to take him through the town?""",said the shopwoman severely.,"""Oh, no,"" said Miriam nervously.","""He's the worst fighter in the parish; they never bring him into the town unless it's the groom sometimes.""","""Thank you,"" said Miriam, taking her bag of coffee creams.","""Dogs _are_ a nuisance, aren't they?""","she added, in an emphatically sympathetic tone, getting away through the swing door almost hating the yellow body that squeezed through at her side and stood eagerly facing towards the market-place waiting for her movements.","7 She hurried up over the bridge calling to the dog without looking round, listening fearfully for sounds of conflict with a brown collie she had caught sight of standing with head high and ears pricked, twenty yards down the street.",The piano-organ jingled angrily.,The dog came thoughtfully trotting over the bridge and ambled off across the common--safe.,"He might have been killed, or killed another dog; how cruel dogs were, without knowing better.",She looked to the common asking consolation for her beating heart.,"The bag of creams was safe and heavy in her hand, the dog had gone, the little town was behind, it had hurt her; it was spoiled; she would never like it.",It had done nothing but remind her that she was a helpless dingy little governess.,"She toiled along, feeling dreadfully tired; the sounds of her boot soles on the firm, sand-powdered road mocked her, telling her she must go on.","If she could be quite sure of finding a kind woman, not a hard-featured woman with black and grey hair, like the shopwoman, but kind, knowing and understanding everything, in a large print apron with her sleeves rolled up to the elbows, living in a large cottage with a family, who would look at her and smile a quiet short certain smile, as if she had been waiting for her, and take her in and let her help and stay there for ever, she would put down the bag of coffee creams on the edge of the common and go straight across it to her; but there would not be a woman like that here; all that the women round here would think about her would be to wonder which of the families she belonged to.","If a victoria came along and in it a delicate, lonely old gentleman who had a large empty house with deep quiet rooms and a large sunny garden with high walls and wanted someone to be about there singing and happy till he died she would go.","He would drive away with her and shut her up in the quiet beautiful house, protecting her and keeping people off, and she would sing all day in the garden and the house and play to him and read sometimes aloud, and he would forget he was old and ill, and they would share the great secret, dying of happiness.",Die of happiness.,People ought to be able to die of happiness if they were able to admit how happy they were.,"If they admitted it aloud they would pass straight out of their bodies, alive;
