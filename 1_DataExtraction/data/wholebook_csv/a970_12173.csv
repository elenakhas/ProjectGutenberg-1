tell my secret; Not so much have I been granted License to avow my sufferings, But I am, as 't were commanded Thus to break my painful silence, Doing honestly, though sadly, Willingly the fact disclosing, Which by force had been extracted.","Hear it, Claudius: my Chrysanthus, My Chrysanthus is not absent: In this very house he 's living!-- Would the gods, ah!","me, had rather Made a tomb and not a prison Of his present locked apartment!","Which is in this house, within it Is he prisoned, chained, made captive.","This surprises thee, no wonder: More surprised thou 'lt be hereafter, When thou com'st to know the reason Of a fact so strange and startling.","On that fatal day, when I Sought the mount and thou the garden, Him I found where thou didst lose him, Near the wood where he had rambled: He was taken by my soldiers At the entrance of a cavern, With Carpophorus:--oh!","here Patience, patience may heaven grant me!-- It was lucky that they did not See his face, for thus it happened That the front of my dishonour Was not in his face made patent: Him they captured without knowing Who he was, it being commanded That the faces of the prisoners Should be covered, but ere captured This effectually was done By themselves, they flying backward With averted faces; he Thus was taken, but his partner, That strange prodigy of Rome-- Man in mind, wild beast in manners, Doubly thus a prodigy-- Saved himself by power of magic.","Thus Chrysanthus was sole prisoner, While the Christian crowd, disheartened, Fled for safety to the mountains From their grottoes and their caverns.","These the soldiers quickly followed, And behind in that abandoned Savage place remained but two-- Two, oh!","think, a son and father.-- One a judge, too, in a cause Wicked, bad, beyond example, In a cause that outraged Caesar, And the gods themselves disparaged.","There with a delinquent son Stood I, therefore this should happen, That both clemency and rigour In my heart waged fearful battle-- Clemency in fine had won, I would have removed the bandage From his eyes and let him fly, But that instant, ah!",unhappy!,"Came the soldiers back, and then It were but more misery added, If they knew of my connivance: All that then my care could manage To protect him was the secret Of his name to keep well guarded.","Thus to Rome I brought him prisoner, Where pretending great exactness, That his friends should not discover Where this Christian malefactor Was imprisoned, to this house, To my own house, I commanded That he should be brought; there hidden And unknown, a few days after I in his place substituted .",.,.,Ah!,what will not the untrammelled Strength of arbitrary power Dare attempt?,what law not trample?,"Substituted, I repeat, For my son a slave, whose strangled, Headless corse thus paid the debt Which from me were else exacted.","You will say, ""Since fortune thus Has the debt so happily cancelled, Why imprison or conceal him?""","-- And, thus, full of doubts, I answer That though it is true I wished not, Woe is me!","the common scaffold Should his punishment make public, I as little wished his hardened Heart should know my love and pity Since it did not fear my anger: Ah!","believe me, Claudius, 'Twixt the chastisement a father And an executioner gives, A great difference must be granted: One hand honours what it striketh, One disgraces, blights, and blackens.","Soon my rigour ceased, for truly, In a father's heart it lasteth Seldom long: but then what wonder, If the hand that in its anger Smites his son, in his own breast Leaves a wound that ever rankles-- I one day his prison entered With the wish (I own it frankly) To forgive him, and when I Thought he would have even thanked me For receiving a reproof, Not severe, too lenient rather, He began to praise the Christians With such earnestness and ardour, In defence of their new law, That my clemency departed, And my angrier mood returned.",I his doors and windows fastened.,"In the room where he is lying, Well secured by gyves and shackles, Sparingly his food is given him, Through my hands alone it passes, For I dare not to another Trust the care his state demandeth.","You will think in this I reached to The extreme of my disasters-- The full limits of misfortune, But not so, and if you hearken, You 'll perceive they 're but beginning, And not ended, as you fancied.","All these strange events so much Have unnerved him and unmanned him, That, forgetful of himself, Of himself he is regardless.",Nothing to the purpose speaks he.,"In his incoherent language Frenzy shows itself, delusion In his thoughts and in his fancies:-- Many times I 've listened to him, Since so high-strung and abstracted Is his mind, he takes no note of Who goes in or who departeth.","Once I heard him deprecating Some despotic beauty's hardness, Saying, ""Since I die for thee, Thou thy favour sure wilt grant me"".","At another time he said, ""Three in one, oh!","how can that be?""",Things which these same Christian people In their law hold quite established.,"Thus it is my life is troubled, Lost in doubts, emeshed, and tangled.","If to freedom I restore him, I have little doubt that, darkened By the Christian treachery, he Will declare himself instanter Openly a Christian, which Would to me be such a scandal, That my blood henceforth were tainted, And my noble name were branded.","If I leave him here in prison, So excessive is his sadness, So extreme his melancholy, That I fear 't will end in madness.","In a word, I hold, my nephew, Hold it as a certain axiom, That these dark magician Christians Keep him bound by their enchantments; Who through hatred of my house, And my office to disparage, Now revenge themselves on me Through my only son Chrysanthus.","Tell me, then, what shall I do; But before you give the answer Which your subtle wit may dictate, I would with your own eyes have thee See him first, you 'll then know better What my urgent need demandeth.","Come, he 's not far off, his quarter Is adjoining this apartment; When you see him, I am certain You will think it a disaster Far less evil he should die, Than that in this cruel manner He should outrage his own blood, And my bright escutcheon blacken.","[He opens a door, and Chrysanthus is seen seated in a chair, with his hands and feet in irons.]",CLAUDIUS.,"Thus to see my friend, o'erwhelms me With a grief I cannot master.",POLEMIUS.,"Stay, do not approach him nearer; For I would not he remarked thee, I would save him the disgrace Of being seen by thee thus shackled.",CLAUDIUS.,"What his misery may dictate We can hear, nor yet attract him.",CHRYSANTHUS.,Was ever human fate so strange as mine?,Were unmatched wishes ever mated so?,"Is it not enough to feel one form of woe, Without being forced 'neath opposite forms to pine?","A triune God's mysterious power divine,   From heaven I ask for life, that I may know,   From heaven I ask for death, life's grisly foe, A fair one's favour in my heart to shrine: But how can death and life so well agree,   That I can ask of heaven to end their strife, And grant them both in pitying love to me?","Yet I will ask, though both with risks are rife, Neither shall hinder me, for heaven must be   The arbiter of death as well as life.",POLEMIUS.,See now if I spoke the truth.,CLAUDIUS.,I am utterly distracted.,(The door closes.,POLEMIUS.,"Lest perhaps he should perceive us, Let us move a little further.","Now advise me how to act, Since you see the grief that racks me.",CLAUDIUS.,"Though it savours of presumption To white hairs like yours, to hazard Words of council, yet at times Even a young man may impart them: Well-proportioned punishment Grave defects oft counteracteth.","But when carried to extremes, It but irritates and hardens.",Any instrument of music Of this truth is an example.,"Lightly touched, it breathes but sweetness, Discord, when 't is roughly handled.","'T is not well to send an arrow To such heights, that in discharging The strong tension breaks the bowstring, Or the bow itself is fractured.","These two simple illustrations Are sufficiently adapted To my purpose, of advising Means of cure both mild and ample.","You must take a middle course, All extremes must be abandoned.",Gentle but judicious treatment Is the method for Chrysanthus.,For severer methods end in Disappointment and disaster.,"Take him, then, from out his prison, Leave him free, unchecked, untrammelled, For the danger is an infant Without strength to hurt or harm him.","Be it that those wretched Christians Have bewitched him, disenchant him, Since you have the power; for Nature With such careful forethought acteth, That an antidotal herb She for every poison planteth.","And if, finally, your wish Is that he this fatal sadness Should forget, and wholly change it To a happier state and gladder, Get him married: for remember Nothing is so well adapted To restrain discursive fancies As the care and the attachment Centered in a wife and children; Taking care that in this matter Mere convenience should not weigh More than his own taste and fancy: Let him choose his wife himself.","Pleased in that, to rove or ramble Then will be beyond his power, Even were he so attracted, For a happy married lover Thinks of naught except his rapture.",POLEMIUS.,"I with nothing such good counsel Can repay, except the frankness Of accepting it, which is The reward yourself would ask for.","And since I a mean must choose Between two extremes of action, From his cell, to-day, my son Shall go forth, but in a manner That will leave his seeming freedom Circumscribed and safely guarded.","Let that hall which looketh over Great Apollo's beauteous garden Be made gay by flowing curtains, Be festooned by flowery garlands; Costly robes for him get ready; Then invite the loveliest damsels Rome can boast of, to come hither To the feasts and to the dances.","Bring musicians, and in fine Let it be proclaimed that any Woman of illustrious blood Who from his delusive passions Can divert him, by her charms Curing him of all his sadness, Shall become his wife, how

her graces Is so powerful, as to temper His affliction, since love conquers All things by his magic presence, He will give her (if a noble) As his wife, and will present her With a portion far surpassing All Polemius' self possesses, Not to speak of what is promised Him whose skill may else effect it.","Thus it is that Rome to-day Laurel wreaths and crowns presenteth To its most renowned

ever made in English verse.","It is, too, as it seems to me, remarkably successful.","Not that asonantes can be made fluent or graceful in English, or easily perceptible to an English ear, but that the Spanish air and character of Calderon are so happily preserved.","Mr. M'Carthy, in 1853, had published two volumes of translations from Calderon, to which I have already referred; and, besides this, he has rendered excellent service to the cause of Spanish literature in other ways.","But in the present volume he has far surpassed all he had previously done; for Calderon is a poet who, whenever he is translated, should have his very excesses, both in thought and manner, fully produced, in order to give a faithful idea of what is grandest and most distinctive in his genius.","Mr. M'Carthy has done this, I conceive, to a degree which I had previously considered impossible.","Nothing, I think, in the English language will give us so true an impression of what is most
