His family followed him at a short distance.",The Professor stopped in front of the bathroom door.,Everything was quiet as death.,"He listened for a minute and then rapped measuredly, steadying his hand by clutching its wrist with the other.","There was a faint splashing, but no other sound.",Another minute passed.,The Professor rapped again.,Now there was no response at all.,He very gingerly tried the knob.,The door was still locked.,"When they had retreated to the stairs, it was the Professor's Wife who once more voiced their thoughts.",This time her voice carried overtones of supernatural horror.,"""_What's he doing in there?_"" ""He may be dead or dying,"" the Professor's Coltish Daughter suggested briskly.","""Maybe we ought to call the Fire Department, like they did for old Mrs.","Frisbee.""",The Professor winced.,"""I'm afraid you haven't visualized the complications, dear,"" he said gently.","""No one but ourselves knows that the Martian is on Earth, or has even the slightest inkling that interplanetary travel has been achieved.","Whatever we do, it will have to be on our own.","But to break in on a creature engaged in--well, we don't know what primal private activity--is against all anthropological practice.","Still--"" ""Dying's a primal activity,"" his daughter said crisply.","""So's ritual bathing before mass murder,"" his wife added.","""Please!","Still, as I was about to say, we do have the moral duty to succor him if, as you all too reasonably suggest, he has been incapacitated by a germ or virus or, more likely, by some simple environmental factor such as Earth's greater gravity.""","""Tell you what, Pop--I can look in the bathroom window and see what he's doing.",All I have to do is crawl out my bedroom window and along the gutter a little ways.,"It's safe as houses.""","*       *       *       *       * The Professor's question beginning with, ""Son, how do you know--"" died unuttered and he refused to notice the words his daughter was voicing silently at her brother.","He glanced at his wife's sardonically composed face, thought once more of the Fire Department and of other and larger and even more jealous--or would it be skeptical?--government agencies, and clutched at the straw offered him.","Ten minutes later, he was quite unnecessarily assisting his son back through the bedroom window.","""Gee, Pop, I couldn't see a sign of him.",That's why I took so long.,"Hey, Pop, don't look so scared.","He's in there, sure enough.","It's just that the bathtub's under the window and you

door.""",The one word the Professor's Wife spoke was like a death knell.,"""_Drowned!_"" ""No, Ma, I don't think so.","His schnozzle was opening and closing regular like.""","""Maybe he's a shape-changer,"" the Professor's Coltish Daughter said in a burst of evil fantasy.","""Maybe he softens in water and thins out after a while until he's like an eel and then he'll go exploring through the sewer pipes.","Wouldn't it be funny if he went under the street and knocked on the stopper from underneath and crawled into the bathtub with President Rexford, or Mrs. President Rexford, or maybe right into the middle of one of Janey Rexford's Oh-I'm-so-sexy bubble baths?""","""Please!""","The Professor put his hand to his eyebrows and kept it there, cuddling the elbow in his other hand.","""Well, have you thought of something?""",the Professor's Wife asked him after a bit.,"""What are you going to do?""",The Professor dropped his hand and blinked his eyes hard and took a deep breath.,"""Telegraph Fenchurch and Ackerly-Ramsbottom and then break in,"" he said in a resigned voice, into which, nevertheless, a note of hope seemed also to have come.","""First, however, I'm going to wait until morning.""",And he sat down cross-legged in the hall a few yards from the bathroom door and folded his arms.,*       *       *       *       * So the long vigil commenced.,The Professor's family shared it and he offered no objection.,"Other and sterner men, he told himself, might claim to be able successfully to order their children to go to bed when there was a Martian locked in the bathroom, but he would like to see them faced with the situation.",Finally dawn began to seep from the bedrooms.,"When the bulb in the hall had grown quite dim, the Professor unfolded his arms.","Just then, there was a loud splashing in the bathroom.",The Professor's family looked toward the door.,The splashing stopped and they heard the Martian moving around.,Then the door opened and the Martian appeared in the Professor's gray pin-stripe suit.,His mouth curled sharply downward in a broad alien smile as he saw the Professor.,"""Good morning!""",the Martian said happily.,"""I never slept better in my life, even in my own little wet bed back on Mars.""",He looked around more closely and his mouth straightened.,"""But where did you all sleep?""",he asked.,"""Don't tell me you stayed dry all night!","You _didn't_ give up your only bed to me?"""
