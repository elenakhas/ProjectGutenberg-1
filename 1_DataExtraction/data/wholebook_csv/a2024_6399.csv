"After he had given his comedies to the world, at a time when he had not passed his thirty-fifth year, in order to avoid suspicion, as he found others publishing their works under his name, or else to make himself acquainted with the modes of life and habits of the Greeks, for the purpose of exhibiting them in his plays, he withdrew from home, to which he never returned.","Volcatius gives this account of his death:     Sed ut Afer sei populo dedit comoedias,     Iter hic in Asiam fecit.","Navem cum semel     Conscendit, visus nunquam est.",Sic vita vacat.,"(535) When Afer had produced six plays for the entertainment of the         people,     He embarked for Asia; but from the time he went on board ship     He was never seen again.",Thus he ended his life.,"Q.

JUNIUS JUVENALIS, who was either the son [944] of a wealthy freedman, or brought up by him, it is not known which, declaimed till the middle of life [945], more from the bent of his inclination, than from any desire to prepare himself either for the schools or the forum.","But having composed a short satire [946], which was clever enough, on Paris [947], the actor of pantomimes, (537) and also on the poet of Claudius Nero, who was puffed up by having held some inferior military rank for six months only; he afterwards devoted himself with much zeal to that style of writing.","For a while indeed, he had not the courage to read them even to a small circle of auditors, but it was not long before he recited his satires to crowded audiences, and with entire success; and this he did twice or thrice, inserting new lines among those which he had originally composed.","Quod non dant proceres, dabit histrio, tu Camerinos,     Et Bareas, tu nobilium magna atria curas.","Praefectos Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunos.",Behold an actor's patronage affords     A surer means of rising than a lord's!,"And wilt thou still the Camerino's [948] court,     Or to the halls of Bareas resort,     When tribunes Pelopea can create     And Philomela praefects, who shall rule the state?","[949] At that time the player was in high favour at court, and many of those who fawned upon him were daily raised to posts of honour.","Juvenal therefore incurred the suspicion of having covertly satirized occurrences which were then passing, and, although eighty years old at that time [950], he was immediately removed from the city, being sent into honourable banishment as praefect of a cohort, which was under orders to proceed to a station at the extreme frontier of Egypt [951].","That (538) sort of punishment was selected, as it appeared severe enough for an offence which was venial, and a mere piece of drollery.","However, he died very soon afterwards, worn down by grief, and weary of his life.",THE LIFE OF PERSIUS.,"AULUS PERSIUS FLACCUS was born the day before the Nones of December [4th Dec.] [952], in the consulship of Fabius Persicus and L. Vitellius.",He died on the eighth of the calends of December [24th Nov.] [953] in the consulship of Rubrius Marius and Asinius Gallus.,"Though born at Volterra, in Etruria, he was a Roman knight, allied both by blood and marriage to persons of the highest rank [954].",He ended his days at an estate he had at the eighth milestone on the Appian Way.,"His father, Flaccus, who died when he was barely six years old, left him under the care of guardians, and his mother, Fulvia Silenna, who afterwards married Fusius, a Roman knight, buried him also in a very few years.","Persius Flaccus pursued his studies at Volterra till he was twelve years old, and then continued them at Rome, under Remmius Palaemon, the grammarian, and Verginius Flaccus, the rhetorician.","Arriving at the age of twenty-one, he formed a friendship with Annaeus Cornutus [955], which lasted through life; and from him he learned the rudiments of philosophy.","Among his earliest friends were Caesius Bassus [956], and Calpurnius Statura; the latter of whom died while Persius himself was yet in his youth.","Servilius (539) Numanus [957], he reverenced as a father.","Through Cornutus he was introduced to Annaeus, as well as to Lucan, who was of his own age, and also a disciple of Cornutus.","At that time Cornutus was a tragic writer; he belonged to the sect of the Stoics, and left behind him some philosophical works.","Lucan was so delighted with the writings of Persius Flaccus, that he could scarcely refrain from giving loud tokens of applause while the author was reciting them, and declared that they had the true spirit of poetry.","It was late before Persius made the acquaintance of Seneca, and then he was not much struck with his natural endowments.","At the house of Cornutus he enjoyed the society of two very learned and excellent men, who were then zealously devoting themselves to philosophical enquiries, namely, Claudius Agaternus, a physician from Lacedaemon, and Petronius Aristocrates, of Magnesia, men whom he held in the highest esteem, and with whom he vied in their studies, as they were of his own age, being younger than Cornutus.","During nearly the last ten years of his life he was much beloved by Thraseas, so that he sometimes travelled abroad in his company; and his cousin Arria was married to him.","Persius was remarkable for gentle manners, for a modesty amounting to bashfulness, a handsome form, and an attachment to his mother, sister, and aunt, which was most exemplary.",He was frugal and chaste.,"He left his mother and sister twenty thousand sesterces, requesting his mother, in a written codicil, to present to Cornutus, as some say, one hundred sesterces, or as others, twenty pounds of wrought silver [958], besides about seven hundred books, which, indeed, included his whole library.","Cornutus, however, would only take the books, and gave up the legacy to the sisters, whom his brother had constituted his heirs.","He wrote [959] seldom, and not very fast; even the work we possess he left incomplete.","Some verses are wanting at the end of the book [960], but Cornutus thoughtlessly recited it, as if (540) it was finished; and on Caesius Bassus requesting to be allowed to publish it, he delivered it to him for that purpose., In his younger days, Persius had written a play, as well as an Itinerary, with several copies of verses on Thraseas' father-in-law, and Arria's [961] mother, who had made away with herself before her husband.",But Cornutus used his whole influence with the mother of Persius to prevail upon her to destroy these compositions.,"As soon as his book of Satires was published, all the world began to admire it, and were eager to buy it up.","He died of a disease in the stomach, in the thirtieth year of his age [962].","But no sooner had he left school and his masters, than he set to work with great vehemence to compose satires, from having read the tenth book of Lucilius; and made the beginning of that book his model; presently launching his invectives all around with so little scruple, that he did not spare cotemporary poets and orators, and even lashed Nero himself, who was then the reigning prince.",The verse ran as follows:     Auriculas asini Mida rex habet;     King Midas has an ass's ears; but Cornutus altered it thus;     Auriculas asini quis non hahet?,Who has not an ass's ears?,in order that it might not be supposed that it was meant to apply to Nero.,THE LIFE OF HORACE.,"HORATIUS FLACCUS was a native of Venusium [963], his father having been, by his own account [964], a freedman and collector of taxes, but, as it is generally believed, a dealer in salted (541) provisions; for some one with whom Horace had a quarrel, jeered him, by saying; ""How often have I seen your father wiping his nose with his fist?""","In the battle of Philippi, he served as a military tribune [965], which post he filled at the instance of Marcus Brutus [966], the general; and having obtained a pardon, on the overthrow of his party, he purchased the office of scribe to a quaestor.","Afterwards insinuating himself first, into the good graces of Mecaenas, and then of Augustus, he secured no small share in the regard of both.","And first, how much Mecaenas loved him may be seen by the epigram in which he says:     Ni te visceribus meis, Horati,     Plus jam diligo, Titium sodalem,     Ginno tu videas strigosiorem.","[967] But it was more strongly exhibited by Augustus, in a short sentence uttered in his last moments: ""Be as mindful of Horatius Flaccus as you are of me!""","Augustus offered to appoint him his secretary, signifying his wishes to Mecaenas in a letter to the following effect: ""Hitherto I have been able to write my own epistles to friends; but now I am too much occupied, and in an infirm state of health.","I wish, therefore, to deprive you of our Horace: let him leave, therefore, your luxurious table and come to the palace, and he shall assist me in writing my letters.""","And upon his refusing to accept the office, he neither exhibited the smallest displeasure, nor ceased to heap upon him tokens of his regard.","Letters of his are extant, from which I will make some short extracts to establish this: ""Use your influence over me with the same freedom as you would do if we were living together as friends.","In so doing you will be perfectly right, and guilty of no impropriety; for I could wish that our intercourse should be on that footing, if your health admitted of it.""","And again: ""How I hold you in memory you may learn (542) from our friend Septimius [968], for I happened to mention you when he was present.","And if you are so proud as to scorn my friendship, that is no reason why I should lightly esteem yours, in return.""","Besides this, among other drolleries, he often called him, ""his most immaculate penis,"" and ""his charming little man,"" and loaded him from time to time with proofs of his munificence.","He admired his works so much, and was so convinced of their enduring fame, that he directed him to compose the Secular Poem, as well as that on the victory of his stepsons Tiberius and Drusus over the Vindelici [969]; and for this purpose urged him to add, after a long interval, a fourth book of Odes to the former three.","After reading his ""Sermones,"" in which he found no mention of himself, he complained in these terms: ""You must know that I am very angry with you, because in most of your works of this description you do not choose to address yourself to me.","Are you afraid that, in times to come, your reputation will suffer; in case it should appear that you lived on terms of intimate friendship with me?""","And he wrung from him the eulogy which begins with,     Cum tot sustineas, et tanta negotia solus:     Res Italas armis tuteris, moribus ornes,     Legibus emendes: in publica commoda peccem,     Si longo sermone morer tua tempora, Caesar.--Epist.",ii.,i.,"While you alone sustain the important weight     Of Rome's affairs, so various and so great;     While you the public weal with arms defend,     Adorn with morals, and with laws amend;     Shall not the tedious letter prove a crime,     That steals one moment of our Caesar's time.--Francis.","In person, Horace was short and fat, as he is described by himself in his Satires [970], and by Augustus in the following letter: ""Dionysius has brought me your small volume, which, little as it is, not to blame you for that, I shall judge favourably.","You seem to me, however, to be afraid lest your volumes should be bigger than yourself.","But if you are short in stature, you are corpulent enough.","You may, therefore, (543) if you will, write in a quart, when the size of your volume is as large round as your paunch.""",It is reported that he was immoderately addicted to venery.,"[For he is said to have had obscene pictures so disposed in a bedchamber lined with mirrors, that, whichever way he looked, lascivious images might present themselves to his view.]","[971]  He lived for the most part in the retirement of his farm [972], on the confines of the Sabine and Tiburtine territories, and his house is shewn in the neighbourhood of a little wood not far from Tibur.","Some Elegies ascribed to him, and a prose Epistle apparently written to commend himself to Mecaenas, have been handed down to us; but I believe that neither of them are genuine works of his; for the Elegies are commonplace, and the Epistle is wanting in perspicuity, a fault which cannot be imputed to his style.","He was born on the sixth of the ides of December [27th December], in the consulship of Lucius Cotta [973] and Lucius Torquatus; and died on the fifth of the calends of December [27th November], in the consulship of Caius Marcius Censorinus and Caius Asinius Gallus [974]; having completed his fifty-ninth year.","He made a nuncupatory will, declaring Augustus his heir, not being able, from the violence of his disorder, to sign one in due form.","He was interred and lies buried on the skirts of the Esquiline Hill, near the tomb of Mecaenas.","[975] (544) M. ANNAEUS LUCANUS, a native of Corduba [976], first tried the powers of his genius in an encomium on Nero, at the Quinquennial games.",He afterwards recited his poem on the Civil War carried on between Pompey and Caesar.,"His vanity was so immense, and he gave such liberty to his tongue, that in some preface, comparing his age and his first efforts with those of Virgil, he had the assurance to say: ""And what now remains for me is to deal with a gnat.""","In his early youth, after being long informed of the sort of life his father led in the country, in consequence of an unhappy marriage [977], he was recalled from Athens by Nero, who admitted him into the circle of his friends, and even gave him the honour of the quaestorship; but he did not long remain in favour.","Smarting at this, and having publicly stated that Nero had withdrawn, all of a sudden, without communicating with the senate, and without any other motive than his own recreation, after this he did not cease to assail the emperor both with foul words and with acts which are still notorious.","So that on one occasion, when easing his bowels in the common privy, there being a louder explosion than usual, he gave vent to the nemistych of Nero: ""One would suppose it was thundering under ground,"" in the hearing of those who were sitting there for the same purpose, and who took to their heels in much consternation [978].","In a poem also, which was in every one's hands, he severely lashed both the emperor and his most powerful adherents.","At length, he became nearly the most active leader in Piso's conspiracy [979]; and while he dwelt without reserve in many quarters on the glory of those who dipped their hands in the (545) blood of tyrants, he launched out into open threats of violence, and carried them so far as to boast that he would cast the emperor's head at the feet of his neighbours.","When, however, the plot was discovered, he did not exhibit any firmness of mind.","A confession was wrung from him without much difficulty; and, humbling himself to the most abject entreaties, he even named his innocent mother as one of the conspirators [980]; hoping that his want of natural affection would give him favour in the eyes of a parricidal prince.","Having obtained permission to choose his mode of death [981], he wrote notes to his father, containing corrections of some of his verses, and, having made a full meal, allowed a physician to open the veins in his arm [982].","I have also heard it said that his poems were offered for sale, and commented upon, not only with care and diligence, but also in a trifling way.",[983] THE LIFE OF PLINY.,"[984] PLINIUS SECUNDUS, a native of New Como [985], having served in (546) the wars with strict attention to his duties, in the rank of a knight, distinguished himself, also, by the great integrity with which he administered the high functions of procurator for a long period in the several provinces intrusted to his charge.","But still he devoted so much attention to literary pursuits, that it would not have been an easy matter for a person who enjoyed entire leisure to have written more than he did.","He comprised, in twenty volumes, an account of all the various wars carried on in successive periods with the German tribes.","Besides this, he wrote a Natural History, which extended to seven books.",He fell a victim to the calamitous event which occurred in Campania.,"For, having the command of the fleet at Misenum, when Vesuvius was throwing up a fiery eruption, he put to sea with his gallies for the purpose of exploring the causes of the phenomenon close on the spot [986].","But being prevented by contrary winds from sailing back, he was suffocated in the dense cloud of dust and ashes.","Some, however, think that he was killed by his slave, having implored him to put an end to his sufferings, when he was reduced to the last extremity by the fervent heat.",[987] THE END OF LIVES OF THE POETS.,"FOOTNOTES: [925]  Lucius Fenestella, an historical writer, is mentioned by Lactantius, Seneca, and Pliny, who says, that he died towards the close of the reign of Tiberius.",[926]  The second Punic war ended A.U.C.,"552, and the third began A.U.C.",605.,Terence was probably born about 560.,[927]  Carthage was laid in ruins A.U.C.,"606 or 607, six hundred and sixty seven years after its foundation.","[928]  These entertainments were given by the aediles M. Fulvius Nobilior and M. Acilius Glabrio, A.U.C.",587.,"[929]  St. Jerom also states that Terence read the ""Andria"" to Caecilius who was a comic poet at Rome; but it is clearly an anachronism, as he died two years before this period.","It is proposed, therefore, to amend the text by substituting Acilius, the aedile; a correction recommended by all the circumstances, and approved by Pitiscus and Ernesti.","[930]  The ""Hecyra,"" The Mother-in-law, is one of Terence's plays.","[931]  The ""Eunuch"" was not brought out till five years after the Andria, A.U.C.",592.,[932]  About 80 pounds sterling; the price paid for the two performances.,"What further right of authorship is meant by the words following, is not very clear.","[933]  The ""Adelphi"" was first acted A.U.C.",593.,"[934]  This report is mentioned by Cicero (Ad Attic, vii.","3), who applies it to the younger Laelius.","The Scipio here mentioned is Scipio Africanus, who was at this time about twenty-one years of age.",[935]  The calends of March was the festival of married women.,"See before, VESPASIAN, c. xix.","[936]  Santra, who wrote biographies of celebrated characters, is mentioned as ""a man of learning,"" by St. Jerom, in his preface to the book on the Ecclesiastical Writers.","[937]  The idea seems to have prevailed that Terence, originally an African slave, could not have attained that purity of style in Latin composition which is found in his plays, without some assistance.","The style of Phaedrus, however; who was a slave from Thrace, and lived in the reign of Tiberius, is equally pure, although no such suspicion attaches to his work.",[938]  Cicero (de Clar.,Orat.,c. 207) gives Sulpicius Gallus a high character as a finished orator and elegant scholar.,He was consul when the Andria was first produced.,"[939]  Labeo and Popilius are also spoken of by Cicero in high terms, Ib.",cc.,21 and 24.,"Q.
