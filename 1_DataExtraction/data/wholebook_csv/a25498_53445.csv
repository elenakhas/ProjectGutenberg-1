            The bay was faithful, wild or still,             To the heart of the ocean far away.","There were three pines above the comb             That, when the sun flared and went down,             Grew like three warriors reaving home             The plunder of a burning town.","A piper lived within the grove,             Tending the pasture of his sheep;             His heart was swayed with faithful love,             From the springs of God’s ocean clear and deep.","And there a ship one evening stood,             Where ship had never stood before;             A pennon bickered red as blood,             An angel glimmered at the prore.","About the coming on of dew,             The sails burned rosy, and the spars             Were gold, and all the tackle grew             Alive with ruby-hearted stars.","The piper heard an outland tongue,             With music in the cadenced fall;             And when the fairy lights were hung,             The sailors gathered one and all,             And leaning on the gunwales dark,             Crusted with shells and dashed with foam,             With all the dreaming hills to hark,             They sang their longing songs of home.","When the sweet airs had fled away,             The piper, with a gentle breath,             Moulded a tranquil melody             Of lonely love and longed-for death.","When the fair sound began to lull,             From out the fireflies and the dew,             A silence held the shadowy hull,             Until the eerie tune was through.","Then from the dark and dreamy deck             An alien song began to thrill;             It mingled with the drumming beck,             And stirred the braird upon the hill.","Beneath the stars each sent to each             A message tender, till at last             The piper slept upon the beach,             The sailors slumbered round the mast.","Still as a dream till nearly dawn,             The ship was bosomed on the tide;             The streamlet, murmuring on and on,             Bore the sweet water to her side.","Then shaking out her lawny sails,             Forth on the misty sea she crept;             She left the dawning of the dales,             Yet in his cloak the piper slept.","And when he woke he saw the ship,             Limned black against the crimson sun;             Then from the disc he saw her slip,             A wraith of shadow—she was gone.","He threw his mantle on the beach,             He went apart like one distraught,             His lips were moved—his desperate speech             Stormed his inviolable thought.","He broke his human-throated reed,             And threw it in the idle rill;             But when his passion had its mead,             He found it in the eddy still.","He mended well the patient flue,             Again he tried its varied stops;             The closures answered right and true,             And starting out in piercing drops,             A melody began to drip             That mingled with a ghostly thrill             The vision-spirit of the ship,             The secret of his broken will.","Beneath the pines he piped and swayed,             Master of passion and of power;             He was his soul and what he played,             Immortal for a happy hour.","He, singing into nature’s heart,             Guiding his will by the world’s will,             With deep, unconscious, childlike art             Had sung his soul out and was still.",And then at evening came the bark             That stirred his dreaming heart’s desire;             It burned slow lights along the dark             That died in glooms of crimson fire.,"The sailors launched a sombre boat,             And bent with music at the oars;             The rhythm throbbing every throat,             And lapsing round the liquid shores,             Was that true tune the piper sent,             Unto the wave-worn mariners,             When with the beck and ripple blent             He heard that outland song of theirs.","Silent they rowed him, dip and drip,             The oars beat out an exequy,             They laid him down within the ship,             They loosed a rocket to the sky.","It broke in many a crimson sphere             That grew to gold and floated far,             And left the sudden shore-line clear,             With one slow-changing, drifting star.","Then out they shook the magic sails,             That charmed the wind in other seas,             From where the west line pearls and pales,             They waited for a ruffling breeze.","But in the world there was no stir,             The cordage slacked with never a creak,             They heard the flame begin to purr             Within the lantern at the peak.","They could not cry, they could not move,             They felt the lure from the charmed sea;             They could not think of home or love             Or any pleasant land to be.","They felt the vessel dip and trim,             And settle down from list to list;             They saw the sea-plain heave and swim             As gently as a rising mist.","And down so slowly, down and down,             Rivet by rivet, plank by plank;             A little flood of ocean flown             Across the deck, she sank and sank.","From knee to breast the water wore,             It crept and crept; ere they were ware             Gone was the angel at the prore,             They felt the water float their hair.","They saw the salt plain spark and shine,             They threw their faces to the sky;             Beneath a deepening film of brine             They saw the star-flash blur and die.","She sank and sank by yard and mast,             Sank down the shimmering gradual dark;             A little drooping pennon last             Showed like the black fin of a shark.","And down she sank till, keeled in sand,             She rested safely balanced true,             With all her upward gazing band,             The piper and the dreaming crew.","And there, unmarked of any chart,             In unrecorded deeps they lie,             Empearled within the purple heart             Of the great sea for aye and aye.","Their eyes are ruby in the green             Long shaft of sun that spreads and rays,             And upward with a wizard sheen             A fan of sea-light leaps and plays.","Tendrils of or and azure creep,             And globes of amber light are rolled,             And in the gloaming of the deep             Their eyes are starry pits of gold.","And sometimes in the liquid night             The hull is changed, a solid gem,             That glows with a soft stony light,             The lost prince of a diadem.","And at the keel a vine is quick,             That spreads its bines and works and weaves             O’er all the timbers veining thick             A plenitude of silver leaves.",AT LES ÉBOULEMENTS.,"A glamour on the phantom shore                    Of golden pallid green,                    Gray purple in the flats before,                    The river streams between.","From hazy hamlets, one by one,                    Beyond the island bars,                    The casements in the setting sun                    Flash back in violet stars.","A brig is straining out for sea,                    To Norway or to France she goes,                    And all her happy flags are free,                    Her sails are flushed with rose.",THE WOLF.,"Whoo—whoo—                     The rain in the hollow                     The wan gray sleet will follow,                     The shaggy moor                     Will lie at the door,                     Heavy with mould,                     Dead with cold,                       Whoo—whoo;—yu-loô—yu-loô.","Whoo—whoo—                     The wind in the willow,                     The snow heaped up for a pillow,                     The shell of ice,                     Will crush in a trice,                     An iron mould,                     To have and to hold,                       Whoo—whoo;—yu-loô—yu-loô.","Whoo—whoo—                     The frost in the furrow,                     Heat takes long to burrow,                     The fire on the hearth                     Shakes its mirth                     At one of God’s poor,                     Outside the door,                       Whoo—whoo;—yu-loô—yu-loô.","Whoo—whoo—                     Weary and worry him,                     Gnaw him, tug him, and carry him;
