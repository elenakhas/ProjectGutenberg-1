The room was empty.,Only the Manager and himself were in it.,"Jones turned from his desk where he had been standing, and locked the door leading into the main office.","He saw the army of clerks scribbling in their shirt-sleeves, for the upper half of the door was of glass.","He had perfect control of himself, and his heart was beating steadily.","The Manager, hearing the key turn in the lock, looked up sharply.","""What's that you're doing?""",he asked quickly.,"""Only locking the door, sir,"" replied the secretary in a quite even voice.","""Why?","Who told you to--?""","""The voice of Justice, sir,"" replied Jones, looking steadily into the hated face.","The Manager looked black for a moment, and stared angrily across the room at him.","Then suddenly his expression changed as he stared, and he tried to smile.","It was meant to be a kind smile evidently, but it only succeeded in being frightened.","""That _is_ a good idea in this weather,"" he said lightly, ""but it would be much better to lock it on the _outside_, wouldn't it, Mr.","Jones?""","""I think not, sir.",You might escape me then.,"Now you can't.""",Jones took his pistol out and pointed it at the other's face.,"Down the barrel he saw the features of the tall dark man, evil and sinister.",Then the outline trembled a little and the face of the Manager slipped back into its place.,"It was white as death, and shining with perspiration.","""You tortured me to death four hundred years ago,"" said the clerk in the same steady voice, ""and now the dispensers of justice have chosen me to punish you.""","The Manager's face turned to flame, and then back to chalk again.","He made a quick movement towards the telephone bell, stretching out a hand to reach it, but at the same moment Jones pulled the trigger and the wrist was shattered, splashing the wall behind with blood.","""That's _one_ place where the chains burnt,"" he said quietly to himself.","His hand was absolutely steady, and he felt that he was a hero.","The Manager was on his feet, with a scream of pain, supporting himself with his right hand on the desk in front of him, but Jones pressed the trigger again, and a bullet flew into the other wrist, so that the big man, deprived of support, fell forward with a crash on to the desk.","""You damned madman!""",shrieked the Manager.,"""Drop that pistol!""","""That's _another_ place,"" was all Jones said, still taking careful aim for another shot.","The big man, screaming and blundering, scrambled beneath the desk, making frantic efforts to hide, but the secretary took a step forward and fired two shots in quick succession into his projecting legs, hitting first one ankle and then the other, and smashing them horribly.","""Two more places where the chains burnt,"" he said, going a little nearer.","The Manager, still shrieking, tried desperately to squeeze his bulk behind the shelter of the opening beneath the desk, but he was far too large, and his bald head protruded through on the other side.",Jones caught him by the scruff of his great neck and dragged him yelping out on to the carpet.,"He was covered with blood, and flopped helplessly upon his broken wrists.","""Be quick now!""",cried the voice of Thorpe.,"There was a tremendous commotion and banging at the door, and Jones gripped his pistol tightly.","Something seemed to crash through his brain, clearing it for a second, so that he thought he saw beside him a great veiled figure, with drawn sword and flaming eyes, and sternly approving attitude.","""Remember the eyes!","Remember the eyes!""",hissed Thorpe in the air above him.,"Jones felt like a god, with a god's power.",Vengeance disappeared from his mind.,He was acting impersonally as an instrument in the hands of the Invisibles who dispense justice and balance accounts.,"He bent down and put the barrel close into the other's face, smiling a little as he saw the childish efforts of the arms to cover his head.","Then he pulled the trigger, and a bullet went straight into the right eye, blackening the skin.","Moving the pistol two inches the other way, he sent another bullet crashing into the left eye.",Then he stood upright over his victim with a deep sigh of satisfaction.,"The Manager wriggled convulsively for the space of a single second, and then lay still in death.","There was not a moment to lose, for the door was already broken in and violent hands were at his neck.",Jones put the pistol to his temple and once more pressed the trigger with his finger.,But this time there was no report.,"Only a little dead click answered the pressure, for the secretary had forgotten that the pistol had only six chambers, and that he had used them all.","He threw the useless weapon on to the floor, laughing a little out loud, and turned, without a struggle, to give himself up.","""I _had_ to do it,"" he said quietly, while they tied him.","""It was simply my duty!","And now I am ready to face the consequences, and Thorpe will be proud of me.","For justice has been done and the gods are satisfied.""","He made not the slightest resistance, and when the two policemen marched him off through the crowd of shuddering little clerks in the office, he again saw the veiled figure moving majestically in front of him, making slow sweeping circles with the flaming sword, to keep back the host of faces that were thronging in upon him from the Other Region.","*       *       *       *       * _The Man Who Found Out_ (A Nightmare) 1 Professor Mark Ebor, the scientist, led a double life, and the only persons who knew it were his assistant, Dr. Laidlaw, and his publishers.","But a double life need not always be a bad one, and, as Dr. Laidlaw and the gratified publishers well knew, the parallel lives of this particular man were equally good, and indefinitely produced would certainly have ended in a heaven somewhere that can suitably contain such strangely opposite characteristics as his remarkable personality combined.","For Mark Ebor, F.R.S., etc., etc., was that unique combination hardly ever met with in actual life, a man of science and a mystic.","As the first, his name stood in the gallery of the great, and as the second--but there came the mystery!","For under the pseudonym of ""Pilgrim"" (the author of that brilliant series of books that appealed to so many), his identity was as well concealed as that of the anonymous writer of the weather reports in a daily newspaper.","Thousands read the sanguine, optimistic, stimulating little books that issued annually from the pen of ""Pilgrim,"" and thousands bore their daily burdens better for having read; while the Press generally agreed that the author, besides being an incorrigible enthusiast and optimist, was also--a woman; but no one ever succeeded in penetrating the veil of anonymity and discovering that ""Pilgrim"" and the biologist were one and the same person.","Mark Ebor, as Dr. Laidlaw knew him in his laboratory, was one man; but Mark Ebor, as he sometimes saw him after work was over, with rapt eyes and ecstatic face, discussing the possibilities of ""union with God"" and the future of the human race, was quite another.","""I have always held, as you know,"" he was saying one evening as he sat in the little study beyond the laboratory with his assistant and intimate, ""that Vision should play a large part in the life of the awakened man--not to be regarded as infallible, of course, but to be observed and made use of as a guide-post to possibilities--"" ""I am aware of your peculiar views, sir,"" the young doctor put in deferentially, yet with a certain impatience.","""For Visions come from a region of the consciousness where observation and experiment are out of the question,"" pursued the other with enthusiasm, not noticing the interruption, ""and, while they should be checked by reason afterwards, they should not be laughed at or ignored.","All inspiration, I hold, is of the nature of interior Vision, and all our best knowledge has come--such is my confirmed belief--as a sudden revelation to the brain prepared to receive it--"" ""Prepared by hard work first, by concentration, by the closest possible study of ordinary phenomena,"" Dr. Laidlaw allowed himself to observe.","""Perhaps,"" sighed the other; ""but by a process, none the less, of spiritual illumination.","The best match in the world will not light a candle unless the wick be first suitably prepared.""",It was Laidlaw's turn to sigh.,"He knew so well the impossibility of arguing with his chief when he was in the regions of the mystic, but at the same time the respect he felt for his tremendous attainments was so sincere that he always listened with attention and deference, wondering how far the great man would go and to what end this curious combination of logic and ""illumination"" would eventually lead him.","""Only last night,"" continued the elder man, a sort of light coming into his rugged features, ""the vision came to me again--the one that has haunted me at intervals ever since my youth, and that will not be denied.""",Dr. Laidlaw fidgeted in his chair.,"""About the Tablets of the Gods, you mean--and that they lie somewhere hidden in the sands,"" he said patiently.",A sudden gleam of interest came into his face as he turned to catch the professor's reply.,"""And that I am to be the one to find them, to decipher them, and to give the great knowledge to the world--"" ""Who will not believe,"" laughed Laidlaw shortly, yet interested in spite of his thinly-veiled contempt.","""Because even the keenest minds, in the right sense of the word, are hopelessly--unscientific,"" replied the other gently, his face positively aglow with the memory of his vision.","""Yet what is more likely,"" he continued after a moment's pause, peering into space with rapt eyes that saw things too wonderful for exact language to describe, ""than that there should have been given to man in the first ages of the world some record of the purpose and problem that had been set him to solve?","In a word,"" he cried, fixing his shining eyes upon the face of his perplexed assistant, ""that God's messengers in the far-off ages should have given to His creatures some full statement of the secret of the world, of the secret of the soul, of the meaning of life and death--the explanation of our being here, and to what great end we are destined in the ultimate fullness of things?""",Dr. Laidlaw sat speechless.,These outbursts of mystical enthusiasm he had witnessed before.,"With any other man he would not have listened to a single sentence, but to Professor Ebor, man of knowledge and profound investigator, he listened with respect, because he regarded this condition as temporary and pathological, and in some sense a reaction from the intense strain of the prolonged mental concentration of many days.","He smiled, with something between sympathy and resignation as he met the other's rapt gaze.","""But you have said, sir, at other times, that you consider the ultimate secrets to be screened from all possible--"" ""The _ultimate_ secrets, yes,"" came the unperturbed reply; ""but that there lies buried somewhere an indestructible record of the secret meaning of life, originally known to men in the days of their pristine innocence, I am convinced.","And, by this strange vision so often vouchsafed to me, I am equally sure that one day it shall be given to me to announce to a weary world this glorious and terrific message.""","And he continued at great length and in glowing language to describe the species of vivid dream that had come to him at intervals since earliest childhood, showing in detail how he discovered these very Tablets of the Gods, and proclaimed their splendid contents--whose precise nature was always, however, withheld from him in the vision--to a patient and suffering humanity.","""The _Scrutator_, sir, well described 'Pilgrim' as the Apostle of Hope,"" said the young doctor gently, when he had finished; ""and now, if that reviewer could hear you speak and realize from what strange depths comes your simple faith--"" The professor held up his hand, and the smile of a little child broke over his face like sunshine in the morning.","""Half the good my books do would be instantly destroyed,"" he said sadly; ""they would say that I wrote with my tongue in my cheek.","But wait,"" he added significantly; ""wait till I find these Tablets of the Gods!",Wait till I hold the solutions of the old world-problems in my hands!,"Wait till the light of this new revelation breaks upon confused humanity, and it wakes to find its bravest hopes justified!","Ah, then, my dear Laidlaw--"" He broke off suddenly; but the doctor, cleverly guessing the thought in his mind, caught him up immediately.","""Perhaps this very summer,"" he said, trying hard to make the suggestion keep pace with honesty; ""in your explorations in Assyria--your digging in the remote civilization of what was once Chaldea, you may find--what you dream of--"" The professor held up his hand, and the smile of a fine old face.","""Perhaps,"" he murmured softly, ""perhaps!""","And the young doctor, thanking the gods of science that his leader's aberrations were of so harmless a character, went home strong in the certitude of his knowledge of externals, proud that he was able to refer his visions to self-suggestion, and wondering complaisantly whether in his old age he might not after all suffer himself from visitations of the very kind that afflicted his respected chief.","And as he got into bed and thought again of his master's rugged face, and finely shaped head, and the deep lines traced by years of work and self-discipline, he turned over on his pillow and fell asleep with a sigh that was half of wonder, half of regret.","2 It was in February, nine months later, when Dr. Laidlaw made his way to Charing Cross to meet his chief after his long absence of travel and exploration.",The vision about the so-called Tablets of the Gods had meanwhile passed almost entirely from his memory.,"There were few people in the train, for the stream of traffic was now running the other way, and he had no difficulty in finding the man he had come to meet.",The shock of white hair beneath the low-crowned felt hat was alone enough to distinguish him by easily.,"""Here I am at last!""","exclaimed the professor, somewhat wearily, clasping his friend's hand as he listened to the young doctor's warm greetings and questions.","""Here I am--a little older, and _much_ dirtier than when you last saw me!""",He glanced down laughingly at his travel-stained garments.,"""And _much_ wiser,"" said Laidlaw, with a smile, as he bustled about the platform for porters and gave his chief the latest scientific news.",At last they came down to practical considerations.,"""And your luggage--where is that?","You must have tons of it, I suppose?""",said Laidlaw.,"""Hardly anything,"" Professor Ebor answered.","""Nothing, in fact, but what you see.""","""Nothing but this hand-bag?""","laughed the other, thinking he was joking.","""And a small portmanteau in the van,"" was the quiet reply.","""I have no other luggage.""","""You have no other luggage?""","repeated Laidlaw, turning sharply to see if he were in earnest.","""Why should I need more?""",the professor added simply.,"Something in the man's face, or voice, or manner--the doctor hardly knew which--suddenly struck him as strange.","There was a change in him, a change so profound--so little on the surface, that is--that at first he had not become aware of it.","For a moment it was as though an utterly alien personality stood before him in that noisy, bustling throng.","Here, in all the homely, friendly turmoil of a Charing Cross crowd, a curious feeling of cold passed over his heart, touching his life with icy finger, so that he actually trembled and felt afraid.","He looked up quickly at his friend, his mind working with startled and unwelcome thoughts.","""Only this?""","he repeated, indicating the bag.","""But where's all the stuff you went away with?","And--have you brought nothing home--no treasures?""","""This is all I have,"" the other said briefly.",The pale smile that went with the words caused the doctor a second indescribable sensation of uneasiness.,"Something was very wrong, something was very queer; he wondered now that he had not noticed it sooner.","""The rest follows, of course, by slow freight,"" he added tactfully, and as naturally as possible.","""But come, sir, you must be tired and in want of food after your long journey.","I'll get a taxi at once, and we can see about the other luggage afterwards.""",It seemed to him he hardly knew quite what he was saying; the change in his friend had come upon him so suddenly and now grew upon him more and more distressingly.,Yet he could not make out exactly in what it consisted.,"A terrible suspicion began to take shape in his mind, troubling him dreadfully.","""I am neither very tired, nor in need of food, thank you,"" the professor said quietly.","""And this is all I have.",There is no luggage to follow.,"I have brought home nothing--nothing but what you see.""",His words conveyed finality.,"They got into a taxi, tipped the porter, who had been staring in amazement at the venerable figure of the scientist, and were conveyed slowly and noisily to the house in the north of London where the laboratory was, the scene of their labours of years.","And the whole way Professor Ebor uttered no word, nor did Dr. Laidlaw find the courage to ask a single question.","It was only late that night, before he took his departure, as the two men were standing before the fire in the study--that study where they had discussed so many problems of vital and absorbing interest--that Dr. Laidlaw at last found strength to come to the point with direct questions.","The professor had been giving him a superficial and desultory account of his travels, of his journeys by camel, of his encampments among the mountains and in the desert, and of his explorations among the buried temples, and, deeper, into the waste of the pre-historic sands, when suddenly the doctor came to the desired point with a kind of nervous rush, almost like a frightened boy.","""And you found--"" he began stammering, looking hard at the other's dreadfully altered face, from which every line of hope and cheerfulness seemed to have been obliterated as a sponge wipes markings from a slate--""you found--"" ""I found,"" replied the other, in a solemn voice, and it was the voice of the mystic rather than the man of science--""I found what I went to seek.",The vision never once failed me.,It led me straight to the place like a star in the heavens.,"I found--the Tablets of the Gods.""","Dr. Laidlaw caught his breath, and steadied himself on the back of a chair.",The words fell like particles of ice upon his heart.,For the first time the professor had uttered the well-known phrase without the glow of light and wonder in his face that always accompanied it.,"""You have--brought them?""",he faltered.,"""I have brought them home,"" said the other, in a voice with a ring like iron; ""and I have--deciphered them.""","Profound despair, the bloom of outer darkness, the dead sound of a hopeless soul freezing in the utter cold of space seemed to fill in the pauses between the brief sentences.","A silence followed, during which Dr. Laidlaw saw nothing but the white face before him alternately fade and return.",And it was like the face of a dead man.,"""They are, alas, indestructible,"" he heard the voice continue, with its even, metallic ring.","""Indestructible,"" Laidlaw repeated mechanically, hardly knowing what he was saying.","Again a silence of several minutes passed, during which, with a creeping cold about his heart, he stood and stared into the eyes of the man he had known and loved so long--aye, and worshipped, too; the man who had first opened his own eyes when they were blind, and had led him to the gates of knowledge, and no little distance along the difficult path beyond; the man who, in another direction, had passed on the strength of his faith into the hearts of thousands by his books.","""I may see them?""","he asked at last, in a low voice he hardly recognized as his own.","""You will let me know--their message?""","Professor Ebor kept his eyes fixedly upon his assistant's face as he answered, with a smile that was more like the grin of death than a living human smile.","""When I am gone,"" he whispered; ""when I have passed away.",Then you shall find them and read the translation I have made.,"And then, too, in your turn, you must try, with the latest resources of science at your disposal to aid you, to compass their utter destruction.""","He paused a moment, and his face grew pale as the face of a corpse.","""Until that time,"" he added presently, without looking up, ""I must ask you not to refer to the subject again--and to keep my confidence meanwhile--_ab--so--lute--ly_.""","3 A year passed slowly by, and at the end of it Dr. Laidlaw had found it necessary to sever his working connexion with his friend and one-time leader.",Professor Ebor was no longer the same man.,The light had gone out of his life; the laboratory was closed; he no longer put pen to paper or applied his mind to a single problem.,In the short space of a few months he had passed from a hale and hearty man of late middle life to the condition of old age--a man collapsed and on the edge of dissolution.,"Death, it was plain, lay waiting for him in the shadows of any day--and he knew it.","To describe faithfully the nature of this profound alteration in his character and temperament is not easy, but Dr. Laidlaw summed it up to himself in three words: _Loss of Hope_.","The splendid mental powers remained indeed undimmed, but the incentive to use them--to use them for the help of others--had gone.","The character still held to its fine and unselfish habits of years, but the far goal to which they had been the leading strings had faded away.","The desire for knowledge--knowledge for its own sake--had died, and the passionate hope which hitherto had animated with tireless energy the heart and brain of this splendidly equipped intellect had suffered total eclipse.",The central fires had gone out.,"Nothing was worth doing, thinking, working for.",There _was_ nothing to work for any longer!,The professor's first step was to recall as many of his books as possible; his second to close his laboratory and stop all research.,"He gave no explanation, he invited no questions.","His whole personality crumbled away, so to speak, till his daily life became a mere mechanical process of clothing the body, feeding the body, keeping it in good health so as to avoid physical discomfort, and, above all, doing nothing that could interfere with sleep.","The professor did everything he could to lengthen the hours of sleep, and therefore of forgetfulness.",It was all clear enough to Dr. Laidlaw.,"A weaker man, he knew, would have sought to lose himself in one form or another of sensual indulgence--sleeping-draughts, drink, the first pleasures that came to hand.","Self-destruction would have been the method of a little bolder type; and deliberate evil-doing, poisoning with his awful knowledge all he could, the means of still another kind of man.",Mark Ebor was none of these.,"He held himself under fine control, facing silently and without complaint the terrible facts he honestly believed himself to have been unfortunate enough to discover.","Even to his intimate friend and assistant, Dr. Laidlaw, he vouchsafed no word of true explanation or lament.","He went straight forward to the end, knowing well that the end was not very far away.","And death came very quietly one day to him, as he was sitting in the arm-chair of the study, directly facing the doors of the laboratory--the doors that no longer opened.","Dr. Laidlaw, by happy chance, was with him at the time, and just able to reach his side in response to the sudden painful efforts for breath; just in time, too, to catch the murmured words that fell from the pallid lips like a message from the other side of the grave.","""Read them, if you must; and, if you can--destroy.","But""--his voice sank so low that Dr. Laidlaw only just caught the dying syllables--""but--never, never--give them to the world.""",And like a grey bundle of dust loosely gathered up in an old garment the professor sank back into his chair and expired.,But this was only the death of the body.,His spirit had died two years before.,"4 The estate of the dead man was small and uncomplicated, and Dr. Laidlaw, as sole executor and residuary legatee, had no difficulty in settling it up.","A month after the funeral he was sitting alone in his upstairs library, the last sad duties completed, and his mind full of poignant memories and regrets for the loss of a friend he had revered and loved, and to whom his debt was so incalculably great.","The last two years, indeed, had been for him terrible.","To watch the swift decay of the greatest combination of heart and brain he had ever known, and to realize he was powerless to help, was a source of profound grief to him that would remain to the end of his days.",At the same time an insatiable curiosity possessed him.,"The study of dementia was, of course, outside his special province as a specialist, but he knew enough of it to understand how small a matter might be the actual cause of how great an illusion, and he had been devoured from the very beginning by a ceaseless and increasing anxiety to know what the professor had found in the sands of ""Chaldea,"" what these precious Tablets of the Gods might be, and particularly--for this was the real cause that had sapped the man's sanity and hope--what the inscription was that he had believed to have deciphered thereon.","The curious feature of it all to his own mind was, that whereas his friend had dreamed of finding a message of glorious hope and comfort, he had apparently found (so far as he had found anything intelligible at all, and not invented the whole thing in his dementia) that the secret of the world, and the meaning of life and death, was of so terrible a nature that it robbed the heart of courage and the soul of hope.","What, then, could be the contents of the little brown parcel the professor had bequeathed to him with his pregnant dying sentences?","Actually his hand was trembling as he turned to the writing-table and began slowly to unfasten a small old-fashioned desk on which the small gilt initials ""M.E.""",stood forth as a melancholy memento.,He put the key into the lock and half turned it.,"Then, suddenly, he stopped and looked about him.",Was that a sound at the back of the room?,It was just as though someone had laughed and then tried to smother the laugh with a cough.,A slight shiver ran over him as he stood listening.,"""This is absurd,"" he said aloud; ""too absurd for belief--that I should be so nervous!","It's the effect of curiosity unduly prolonged.""",He smiled a little sadly and his eyes wandered to the blue summer sky and the plane trees swaying in the wind below his window.,"""It's the reaction,"" he continued.","""The curiosity of two years to be quenched in a single moment!","The nervous tension, of course, must be considerable.""",He turned back to the brown desk and opened it without further delay.,"His hand was firm now, and he took out the paper parcel that lay inside without a tremor.",It was heavy.,"A moment later there lay on the table before him a couple of weather-worn plaques of grey stone--they looked like stone, although they felt like metal--on which he saw markings of a curious character that might have been the mere tracings of natural forces through the ages, or, equally well, the half-obliterated hieroglyphics cut upon their surface in past centuries by the more or less untutored hand of a common scribe.",He lifted each stone in turn and examined it carefully.,"It seemed to him that a faint glow of heat passed from the substance into his skin, and he put them down again suddenly, as with a gesture of uneasiness.","""A very clever, or a very imaginative man,"" he said to himself, ""who could squeeze the secrets of life and death from such broken lines as those!""","Then he turned to a yellow envelope lying beside them in the desk, with the single word on the outside in the writing of the professor--the word _Translation_.","""Now,"" he thought, taking it up with a sudden violence to conceal his nervousness, ""now for the great solution.","Now to learn the meaning of the worlds, and why mankind was made, and why discipline is worth while, and sacrifice and pain the true law of advancement.""","There was the shadow of a sneer in his voice, and yet something in him shivered at the same time.","He held the envelope as though weighing it in his hand, his mind pondering many things.","Then curiosity won the day, and he suddenly tore it open with the gesture of an actor who tears open a letter on the stage, knowing there is no real writing inside at all.",A page of finely written script in the late scientist's handwriting lay before him.,"He read it through from beginning to end, missing no word, uttering each syllable distinctly under his breath as he read.",The pallor of his face grew ghastly as he neared the end.,He began to shake all over as with ague.,His breath came heavily in gasps.,"He still gripped the sheet of paper, however, and deliberately, as by an intense effort of will, read it through a second time from beginning to end.","And this time, as the last syllable dropped from his lips, the whole face of the man flamed with a sudden and terrible anger.","His skin became deep, deep red, and he clenched his teeth.",With all the strength of his vigorous soul he was struggling to keep control of himself.,For perhaps five minutes he stood there beside the table without stirring a muscle.,He might have been carved out of stone.,"His eyes were shut, and only the heaving of the chest betrayed the fact that he was a living being.","Then, with a strange quietness, he lit a match and applied it to the sheet of paper he held in his hand.","The ashes fell slowly about him, piece by piece, and he blew them from the window-sill into the air, his eyes following them as they floated away on the summer wind that breathed so warmly over the world.",He turned back slowly into the room.,"Although his actions and movements were absolutely steady and controlled, it was clear that he was on the edge of violent action.",A hurricane might burst upon the still room any moment.,His muscles were tense and rigid.,"Then, suddenly, he whitened, collapsed, and sank backwards into a chair, like a tumbled bundle of inert matter.",He had fainted.,In less than half an hour he recovered consciousness and sat up.,"As before, he made no sound.",Not a syllable passed his lips.,He rose quietly and looked about the room.,Then he did a curious thing.,"Taking a heavy stick from the rack in the corner he approached the mantlepiece, and with a heavy shattering blow he smashed the clock to pieces.",The glass fell in shivering atoms.,"""Cease your lying voice for ever,"" he said, in a curiously still, even tone.","""There is no such thing as _time_!""","He took the watch from his pocket, swung it round several times by the long gold chain, smashed it into smithereens against the wall with a single blow, and then walked into his laboratory next door, and hung its broken body on the bones of the skeleton in the corner of the room.","""Let one damned mockery hang upon another,"" he said smiling oddly.","""Delusions, both of you, and cruel as false!""",He slowly moved back to the front room.,"He stopped opposite the bookcase where stood in a row the ""Scriptures of the World,"" choicely bound and exquisitely printed, the late professor's most treasured possession, and next to them several books signed ""Pilgrim.""",One by one he took them from the shelf and hurled them through the open window.,"""A devil's dreams!","A devil's foolish dreams!""","he cried, with a vicious laugh.",Presently he stopped from sheer exhaustion.,"He turned his eyes slowly to the wall opposite, where hung a weird array of Eastern swords and daggers, scimitars and spears, the collections of many journeys.",He crossed the room and ran his finger along the edge.,His mind seemed to waver.,"""No,"" he muttered presently; ""not that way.","There are easier and better ways than that.""",He took his hat and passed downstairs into the street.,"5 It was five o'clock, and the June sun lay hot upon the pavement.",He felt the metal door-knob burn the palm of his hand.,"""Ah, Laidlaw, this is well met,"" cried a voice at his elbow; ""I was in the act of coming to see you.","I've a case that will interest you, and besides, I remembered that you flavoured your tea with orange leaves!--and I admit--"" It was Alexis Stephen, the great hypnotic doctor.","""I've had no tea to-day,"" Laidlaw said, in a dazed manner, after staring for a moment as though the other had struck him in the face.",A new idea had entered his mind.,"""What's the matter?""",asked Dr. Stephen quickly.,"""Something's wrong with you.","It's this sudden heat, or overwork.","Come, man, let's go inside.""","A sudden light broke upon the face of the younger man, the light of a heaven-sent inspiration.","He looked into his friend's face, and told a direct lie.","""Odd,"" he said, ""I myself was just coming to see you.",I have something of great importance to test your confidence with.,"But in _your_ house, please,"" as Stephen urged him towards his own door--""in your house.","It's only round the corner, and I--I cannot go back there--to my rooms--till I have told you.","""I'm your patient--for the moment,"" he added stammeringly as soon as they were seated in the privacy of the hypnotist's sanctum, ""and I want--er--"" ""My dear Laidlaw,"" interrupted the other, in that soothing voice of command which had suggested to many a suffering soul that the cure for its pain lay in the powers of its own reawakened will, ""I am always at your service, as you know.","You have only to tell me what I can do for you, and I will do it.""",He showed every desire to help him out.,His manner was indescribably tactful and direct.,Dr. Laidlaw looked up into his face.,"""I surrender my will to you,"" he said, already calmed by the other's healing presence, ""and I want you to treat me hypnotically--and at once.","I want you to suggest to me""--his voice became very tense--""that I shall forget--forget till I die--everything that has occurred to me during the last two hours; till I die, mind,"" he added, with solemn emphasis, ""till I die.""",He floundered and stammered like a frightened boy.,Alexis Stephen looked at him fixedly without speaking.,"""And further,"" Laidlaw continued, ""I want you to ask me no questions.",I wish to forget for ever something I have recently discovered--something so terrible and yet so obvious that I can hardly understand why it is not patent to every mind in the world--for I have had a moment of absolute _clear vision_--of merciless clairvoyance.,"But I want no one else in the whole world to know what it is--least of all, old friend, yourself.""","He talked in utter confusion, and hardly knew what he was saying.",But the pain on his face and the anguish in his voice were an instant passport to the other's heart.,"""Nothing is easier,"" replied Dr. Stephen, after a hesitation so slight that the other probably did not even notice it.","""Come into my other room where we shall not be disturbed.",I can heal you.,Your memory of the last two hours shall be wiped out as though it had never been.,"You can trust me absolutely.""","""I know I can,"" Laidlaw said simply, as he followed him in.",6 An hour later they passed back into the front room again.,"The sun was already behind the houses opposite, and the shadows began to gather.","""I went off easily?""",Laidlaw asked.,"""You were a little obstinate at first.","But though you came in like a lion, you went out like a lamb.","I let you sleep a bit afterwards.""",Dr. Stephen kept his eyes rather steadily upon his friend's face.,"""What were you doing by the fire before you came here?""","he asked, pausing, in a casual tone, as he lit a cigarette and handed the case to his patient.","""I?",Let me see.,"Oh, I know; I was worrying my way through poor old Ebor's papers and things.","I'm his executor, you know.","Then I got weary and came out for a whiff of air.""",He spoke lightly and with perfect naturalness.,Obviously he was telling the truth.,"""I prefer specimens to papers,"" he laughed cheerily.","""I know, I know,"" said Dr. Stephen, holding a lighted match for the cigarette.",His face wore an expression of content.,The experiment had been a complete success.,The memory of the last two hours was wiped out utterly.,Laidlaw was already chatting gaily and easily about a dozen other things that interested him.,"Together they went out into the street, and at his door Dr. Stephen left him with a joke and a wry face that made his friend laugh heartily.","""Don't dine on the professor's old papers by mistake,"" he cried, as he vanished down the street.",Dr. Laidlaw went up to his study at the top of the house.,"Half way down he met his housekeeper, Mrs. Fewings.","She was flustered and excited, and her face was very red and perspiring.","""There've been burglars here,"" she cried excitedly, ""or something funny!","All your things is just any'ow, sir.","I found everything all about everywhere!""",She was very confused.,In this orderly and very precise establishment it was unusual to find a thing out of place.,"""Oh, my specimens!""","cried the doctor, dashing up the rest of the stairs at top speed.","""Have they been touched or--"" He flew to the door of the laboratory.",Mrs. Fewings panted up heavily behind him.,"""The labatry ain't been touched,"" she explained, breathlessly, ""but they smashed the libry clock and they've 'ung your gold watch, sir, on the skelinton's hands.",And the books that weren't no value they flung out er the window just like so much rubbish.,"They must have been wild drunk, Dr. Laidlaw, sir!""",The young scientist made a hurried examination of the rooms.,Nothing of value was missing.,He began to wonder what kind of burglars they were.,He looked up sharply at Mrs. Fewings standing in the doorway.,For a moment he seemed to cast about in his mind for something.,"""Odd,"" he said at length.","""I only left here an hour ago and everything was all right then.""","""Was it, sir?","Yes, sir.""",She glanced sharply at him.,"Her room looked out upon the courtyard, and she must have seen the books come crashing down, and also have heard her master leave the house a few minutes later.","""And what's this rubbish the brutes have left?""","he cried, taking up two slabs of worn gray stone, on the writing-table.","""Bath brick, or something, I do declare.""",He looked very sharply again at the confused and troubled housekeeper.,"""Throw them on the dust heap, Mrs. Fewings, and--and let me know if anything is missing in the house, and I will notify the police this evening.""",When she left the room he went into the laboratory and took his watch off the skeleton's fingers.,"His face wore a troubled expression, but after a moment's thought it cleared again.",His memory was a complete blank.,"""I suppose I left it on the writing-table when I went out to take the air,"" he said.",And there was no one present to contradict him.,"He crossed to the window and blew carelessly some ashes of burned paper from the sill, and stood watching them as they floated away lazily over the tops of the trees.","*       *       *       *       * _The Glamour of the Snow_ I Hibbert, always conscious of two worlds, was in this mountain village conscious of three.","It lay on the slopes of the Valais Alps, and he had taken a room in the little post office, where he could be at peace to write his book, yet at the same time enjoy the winter sports and find companionship in the hotels when he wanted it.","The three worlds that met and mingled here seemed to his imaginative temperament very obvious, though it is doubtful if another mind less intuitively equipped would have seen them so well-defined.","There was the world of tourist English, civilised, quasi-educated, to which he belonged by birth, at any rate; there was the world of peasants to which he felt himself drawn by sympathy--for he loved and admired their toiling, simple life; and there was this other--which he could only call the world of Nature.","To this last, however, in virtue of a vehement poetic imagination, and a tumultuous pagan instinct fed by his very blood, he felt that most of him belonged.","The others borrowed from it, as it were, for visits.","Here, with the soul of Nature, hid his central life.",Between all three was conflict--potential conflict.,"On the skating-rink each Sunday the tourists regarded the natives as intruders; in the church the peasants plainly questioned: ""Why do you come?","We are here to worship; you to stare and whisper!""",For neither of these two worlds accepted the other.,"And neither did Nature accept the tourists, for it took advantage of their least mistakes, and indeed, even of the peasant-world ""accepted"" only those who were strong and bold enough to invade her savage domain with sufficient skill to protect themselves from several forms of--death.","Now Hibbert was keenly aware of this potential conflict and want of harmony; he felt outside, yet caught by it--torn in the three directions because he was partly of each world, but wholly in only one.","There grew in him a constant, subtle effort--or, at least, desire--to unify them and decide positively to which he should belong and live in.","The attempt, of course, was largely subconscious.","It was the natural instinct of a richly imaginative nature seeking the point of equilibrium, so that the mind could feel at peace and his brain be free to do good work.",Among the guests no one especially claimed his interest.,"The men were nice but undistinguished--athletic schoolmasters, doctors snatching a holiday, good fellows all; the women, equally various--the clever, the would-be-fast, the dare-to-be-dull, the women ""who understood,"" and the usual pack of jolly dancing girls and ""flappers.""","And Hibbert, with his forty odd years of thick experience behind him, got on well with the lot; he understood them all; they belonged to definite, predigested types that are the same the world over, and that he had met the world over long ago.",But to none of them did he belong.,"His nature was too ""multiple"" to subscribe to the set of shibboleths of any one class.","And, since all liked him, and felt that somehow he seemed outside of them--spectator, looker-on--all sought to claim him.","In a sense, therefore, the three worlds fought for him: natives, tourists, Nature....",It was thus began the singular conflict for the soul of Hibbert.,"_In_ his own soul, however, it took place.",Neither the peasants nor the tourists were conscious that they fought for anything.,"And Nature, they say, is merely blind and automatic.","The assault upon him of the peasants may be left out of account, for it is obvious that they stood no chance of success.","The tourist world, however, made a gallant effort to subdue him to themselves.","But the evenings in the hotel, when dancing was not in order, were--English.",The provincial imagination was set upon a throne and worshipped heavily through incense of the stupidest conventions possible.,Hibbert used to go back early to his room in the post office to work.,"""It is a mistake on my part to have _realised_ that there is any conflict at all,"" he thought, as he crunched home over the snow at midnight after one of the dances.","""It would have been better to have kept outside it all and done my work.","Better,"" he added, looking back down the silent village street to the church tower, ""and--safer.""",The adjective slipped from his mind before he was aware of it.,He turned with an involuntary start and looked about him.,He knew perfectly well what it meant--this thought that had thrust its head up from the instinctive region.,"He understood, without being able to express it fully, the meaning that betrayed itself in the choice of the adjective.","For if he had ignored the existence of this conflict he would at the same time, have remained outside the arena.",Whereas now he had entered the lists.,Now this battle for his soul must have issue.,"And he knew that the spell of Nature was greater for him than all other spells in the world combined--greater than love, revelry, pleasure, greater even than study.",He had always been afraid to let himself go.,His pagan soul dreaded her terrific powers of witchery even while he worshipped.,The little village already slept.,The world lay smothered in snow.,"The chalet roofs shone white beneath the moon, and pitch-black shadows gathered against the walls of the church.",His eye rested a moment on the square stone tower with its frosted cross that pointed to the sky: then travelled with a leap of many thousand feet to the enormous mountains that brushed the brilliant stars.,"Like a forest rose the huge peaks above the slumbering village, measuring the night and heavens.",They beckoned him.,"And something born of the snowy desolation, born of the midnight and the silent grandeur, born of the great listening hollows of the night, something that lay 'twixt terror and wonder, dropped from the vast wintry spaces down into his heart--and called him.","Very softly, unrecorded in any word or thought his brain could compass, it laid its spell upon him.",Fingers of snow brushed the surface of his heart.,The power and quiet majesty of the winter's night appalled him....,"Fumbling a moment with the big unwieldy key, he let himself in and went upstairs to bed.","Two thoughts went with him--apparently quite ordinary and sensible ones: ""What fools these peasants are to sleep through such a night!""","And the other: ""Those dances tire me.",I'll never go again.,"My work only suffers in the morning.""",The claims of peasants and tourists upon him seemed thus in a single instant weakened.,The clash of battle troubled half his dreams.,Nature had sent her Beauty of the Night and won the first assault.,"The others, routed and dismayed, fled far away.","II ""Don't go back to your dreary old post office.",We're going to have supper in my room--something hot.,Come and join us.,"Hurry up!""","There had been an ice carnival, and the last party, tailing up the snow-slope to the hotel, called him.",The Chinese lanterns smoked and sputtered on the wires; the band had long since gone.,"The cold was bitter and the moon came only momentarily between high, driving clouds.","From the shed where the people changed from skates to snow-boots he shouted something to the effect that he was ""following""; but no answer came; the moving shadows of those who had called were already merged high up against the village darkness.",The voices died away.,Doors slammed.,Hibbert found himself alone on the deserted rink.,"And it was then, quite suddenly, the impulse came to--stay and skate alone.","The thought of the stuffy hotel room, and of those noisy people with their obvious jokes and laughter, oppressed him.","He felt a longing to be alone with the night; to taste her wonder all by himself there beneath the stars, gliding over the ice.","It was not yet midnight, and he could skate for half an hour.","That supper party, if they noticed his absence at all, would merely think he had changed his mind and gone to bed.","It was an impulse, yes, and not an unnatural one; yet even at the time it struck him that something more than impulse lay concealed behind it.","More than invitation, yet certainly less than command, there was a vague queer feeling that he stayed because he had to, almost as though there was something he had forgotten, overlooked, left undone.",Imaginative temperaments are often thus; and impulse is ever weakness.,For with such ill-considered opening of the doors to hasty action may come an invasion of other forces at the same time--forces merely waiting their opportunity perhaps!,"He caught the fugitive warning even while he dismissed it as absurd, and the next minute he was whirling over the smooth ice in delightful curves and loops beneath the moon.",There was no fear of collision.,He could take his own speed and space as he willed.,"The shadows of the towering mountains fell across the rink, and a wind of ice came from the forests, where the snow lay ten feet deep.",The hotel lights winked and went out.,The village slept.,The high wire netting could not keep out the wonder of the winter night that grew about him like a presence.,"He skated on and on, keen exhilarating pleasure in his tingling blood, and weariness all forgotten.","And then, midway in the delight of rushing movement, he saw a figure gliding behind the wire netting, watching him.",With a start that almost made him lose his balance--for the abruptness of the new arrival was so unlooked for--he paused and stared.,"Although the light was dim he made out that it was the figure of a woman and that she was feeling her way along the netting, trying to get in.",Against the white background of the snow-field he watched her rather stealthy efforts as she passed with a silent step over the banked-up snow.,She was tall and slim and graceful; he could see that even in the dark.,"And then, of course, he understood.","It was another adventurous skater like himself, stolen down unawares from hotel or chalet, and searching for the opening.","At once, making a sign and pointing with one hand, he turned swiftly and skated over to the little entrance on the other side.","But, even before he got there, there was a sound on the ice behind him and, with an exclamation of amazement he could not suppress, he turned to see her swerving up to his side across the width of the rink.",She had somehow found another way in.,"Hibbert, as a rule, was punctilious, and in these free-and-easy places, perhaps, especially so.",If only for his own protection he did not seek to make advances unless some kind of introduction paved the way.,"But for these two to skate together in the semi-darkness without speech, often of necessity brushing shoulders almost, was too absurd to think of.",Accordingly he raised his cap and spoke.,"His actual words he seems unable to recall, nor what the girl said in reply, except that she answered him in accented English with some commonplace about doing figures at midnight on an empty rink.","Quite natural it was, and right.","She wore grey clothes of some kind, though not the customary long gloves or sweater, for indeed her hands were bare, and presently when he skated with her, he wondered with something like astonishment at their dry and icy coldness.","And she was delicious to skate with--supple, sure, and light, fast as a man yet with the freedom of a child, sinuous and steady at the same time.","Her flexibility made him wonder, and when he asked where she had learned she murmured--he caught the breath against his ear and recalled later that it was singularly cold--that she could hardly tell, for she had been accustomed to the ice ever since she could remember.",But her face he never properly saw.,"A muffler of white fur buried her neck to the ears, and her cap came over the eyes.",He only saw that she was young.,"Nor could he gather her hotel or chalet, for she pointed vaguely, when he asked her, up the slopes.","""Just over there--"" she said, quickly taking his hand again.",He did not press her; no doubt she wished to hide her escapade.,And the touch of her hand thrilled him more than anything he could remember; even through his thick glove he felt the softness of that cold and delicate softness.,The clouds thickened over the mountains.,It grew darker.,"They talked very little, and did not always skate together.","Often they separated, curving about in corners by themselves, but always coming together again in the centre of the rink; and when she left him thus Hibbert was conscious of--yes, of missing her.","He found a peculiar satisfaction, almost a fascination, in skating by her side.",It was quite an adventure--these two strangers with the ice and snow and night!,Midnight had long since sounded from the old church tower before they parted.,"She gave the sign, and he skated quickly to the shed, meaning to find a seat and help her take her skates off.",Yet when he turned--she had already gone.,He saw her slim figure gliding away across the snow ... and hurrying for the last time round the rink alone he searched in vain for the opening she had twice used in this curious way.,"""How very queer!""","he thought, referring to the wire netting.","""She must have lifted it and wriggled under ...!""","Wondering how in the world she managed it, what in the world had possessed him to be so free with her, and who in the world she was, he went up the steep slope to the post office and so to bed, her promise to come again another night still ringing delightfully in his ears.",And curious were the thoughts and sensations that accompanied him.,"Most of all, perhaps, was the half suggestion of some dim memory that he had known this girl before, had met her somewhere, more--that she knew him.","For in her voice--a low, soft, windy little voice it was, tender and soothing for all its quiet coldness--there lay some faint reminder of two others he had known, both long since gone: the voice of the woman he had loved, and--the voice of his mother.",But this time through his dreams there ran no clash of battle.,"He was conscious, rather, of something cold and clinging that made him think of sifting snowflakes climbing slowly with entangling touch and thickness round his feet.","The snow, coming without noise, each flake so light and tiny none can mark the spot whereon it settles, yet the mass of it able to smother whole villages, wove through the very texture of his mind--cold, bewildering, deadening effort with its clinging network of ten million feathery touches.","III In the morning Hibbert realised he had done, perhaps, a foolish thing.","The brilliant sunshine that drenched the valley made him see this, and the sight of his work-table with its typewriter, books, papers, and the rest, brought additional conviction.","To have skated with a girl alone at midnight, no matter how innocently the thing had come about, was unwise--unfair, especially to her.",Gossip in these little winter resorts was worse than in a provincial town.,He hoped no one had seen them.,Luckily the night had been dark.,Most likely none had heard the ring of skates.,"Deciding that in future he would be more careful, he plunged into work, and sought to dismiss the matter from his mind.",But in his times of leisure the memory returned persistently to haunt him.,"When he ""ski-d,"" ""luged,"" or danced in the evenings, and especially when he skated on the little rink, he was aware that the eyes of his mind forever sought this strange companion of the night.","A hundred times he fancied that he saw her, but always sight deceived him.","Her face he might not know, but he could hardly fail to recognise her figure.",Yet nowhere among the others did he catch a glimpse of that slim young creature he had skated with alone beneath the clouded stars.,He searched in vain.,Even his inquiries as to the occupants of the private chalets brought no results.,He had lost her.,But the queer thing was that he felt as though she were somewhere close; he _knew_ she had not really gone.,"While people came and left with every day, it never once occurred to him that she had left.","On the contrary, he felt assured that they would meet again.",This thought he never quite acknowledged.,Perhaps it was the wish that fathered it only.,"And, even when he did meet her, it was a question how he would speak and claim acquaintance, or whether _she_ would recognise himself.",It might be awkward.,"He almost came to dread a meeting, though ""dread,"" of course, was far too strong a word to describe an emotion that was half delight, half wondering anticipation.",Meanwhile the season was in full swing.,"Hibbert felt in perfect health, worked hard, ski-d, skated, luged, and at night danced fairly often--in spite of his decision.","This dancing was, however, an act of subconscious surrender; it really meant he hoped to find her among the whirling couples.","He was searching for her without quite acknowledging it to himself; and the hotel-world, meanwhile, thinking it had won him over, teased and chaffed him.",He made excuses in a similar vein; but all the time he watched and searched and--waited.,"For several days the sky held clear and bright and frosty, bitterly cold, everything crisp and sparkling in the sun; but there was no sign of fresh snow, and the ski-ers began to grumble.","On the mountains was an icy crust that made ""running"" dangerous; they wanted the frozen, dry, and powdery snow that makes for speed, renders steering easier and falling less severe.",But the keen east wind showed no signs of changing for a whole ten days.,"Then, suddenly, there came a touch of softer air and the weather-wise began to prophesy.","Hibbert, who was delicately sensitive to the least change in earth or sky, was perhaps the first to feel it.",Only he did not prophesy.,"He knew through every nerve in his body that moisture had crept into the air, was accumulating, and that presently a fall would come.",For he responded to the moods of Nature like a fine barometer.,"And the knowledge, this time, brought into his heart a strange little wayward emotion that was hard to account for--a feeling of unexplained uneasiness and disquieting joy.","For behind it, woven through it rather, ran a faint exhilaration that connected remotely somewhere with that touch of delicious alarm, that tiny anticipating ""dread,"" that so puzzled him when he thought of his next meeting with his skating companion of the night.","It lay beyond all words, all telling, this queer relationship between the two; but somehow the girl and snow ran in a pair across his mind.","Perhaps for imaginative writing-men, more than for other workers, the smallest change of mood betrays itself at once.",His work at any rate revealed this slight shifting of emotional values in his soul.,"Not that his writing suffered, but that it altered, subtly as those changes of sky or sea or landscape that come with the passing of afternoon into evening--imperceptibly.","A subconscious excitement sought to push outwards and express itself ... and, knowing the uneven effect such moods produced in his work, he laid his pen aside and took instead to reading that he had to do.","Meanwhile the brilliance passed from the sunshine, the sky grew slowly overcast; by dusk the mountain tops came singularly close and sharp; the distant valley rose into absurdly near perspective.","The moisture increased, rapidly approaching saturation point, when it must fall in snow.",Hibbert watched and waited.,And in the morning the world lay smothered beneath its fresh white carpet.,"It snowed heavily till noon, thickly, incessantly, chokingly, a foot or more; then the sky cleared, the sun came out in splendour, the wind shifted back to the east, and frost came down upon the mountains with its keenest and most biting tooth.","The drop in the temperature was tremendous, but the ski-ers were jubilant.","Next day the ""running"" would be fast and perfect.","Already the mass was settling, and the surface freezing into those moss-like, powdery crystals that make the ski run almost of their own accord with the faint ""sishing"" as of a bird's wings through the air.","IV That night there was excitement in the little hotel-world, first because there was a _bal costume_, but chiefly because the new snow had come.","And Hibbert went--felt drawn to go; he did not go in costume, but he wanted to talk about the slopes and ski-ing with the other men, and at the same time.... Ah, there was the truth, the deeper necessity that called.","For the singular connection between the stranger and the snow again betrayed itself, utterly beyond explanation as before, but vital and insistent.","Some hidden instinct in his pagan soul--heaven knows how he phrased it even to himself, if he phrased it at all--whispered that with the snow the girl would be somewhere about, would emerge from her hiding place, would even look for him.",Absolutely unwarranted it was.,"He laughed while he stood before the little glass and trimmed his moustache, tried to make his black tie sit straight, and shook down his dinner jacket so that it should lie upon the shoulders without a crease.",His brown eyes were very bright.,"""I look younger than I usually do,"" he thought.","It was unusual, even significant, in a man who had no vanity about his appearance and certainly never questioned his age or tried to look younger than he was.","Affairs of the heart, with one tumultuous exception that left no fuel for lesser subsequent fires, had never troubled him.","The forces of his soul and mind not called upon for ""work"" and obvious duties, all went to Nature.","The desolate, wild places of the earth were what he loved; night, and the beauty of the stars and snow.",And this evening he felt their claims upon him mightily stirring.,"A rising wildness caught his blood, quickened his pulse, woke longing and passion too.",But chiefly snow.,"The snow whirred softly through his thoughts like white, seductive dreams.... For the snow had come; and She, it seemed, had somehow come with it--into his mind.","And yet he stood before that twisted mirror and pulled his tie and coat askew a dozen times, as though it mattered.","""What in the world is up with me?""",he thought.,"Then, laughing a little, he turned before leaving the room to put his private papers in order.",The green morocco desk that held them he took down from the shelf and laid upon the table.,"Tied to the lid was the visiting card with his brother's London address ""in case of accident.""","On the way down to the hotel he wondered why he had done this, for though imaginative, he was not the kind of man who dealt in presentiments.","Moods with him were strong, but ever held in leash.","""It's almost like a warning,"" he thought, smiling.",He drew his thick coat tightly round the throat as the freezing air bit at him.,"""Those warnings one reads of in stories sometimes ...!""",A delicious happiness was in his blood.,Over the edge of the hills across the valley rose the moon.,He saw her silver sheet the world of snow.,Snow covered all.,It smothered sound and distance.,"It smothered houses, streets, and human beings.",It smothered--life.,"V In the hall there was light and bustle; people were already arriving from the other hotels and chalets, their costumes hidden beneath many wraps.","Groups of men in evening dress stood about smoking, talking ""snow"" and ""ski-ing.""",The band was tuning up.,The claims of the hotel-world clashed about him faintly as of old.,"At the big glass windows of the verandah, peasants stopped a moment on their way home from the _cafe_ to peer.",Hibbert thought laughingly of that conflict he used to imagine.,He laughed because it suddenly seemed so unreal.,"He belonged so utterly to Nature and the mountains, and especially to those desolate slopes where now the snow lay thick and fresh and sweet, that there was no question of a conflict at all.","The power of the newly fallen snow had caught him, proving it without effort.","Out there, upon those lonely reaches of the moonlit ridges, the snow lay ready--masses and masses of it--cool, soft, inviting.",He longed for it.,It awaited him.,He thought of the intoxicating delight of ski-ing in the moonlight....,"Thus, somehow, in vivid flashing vision, he thought of it while he stood there smoking with the other men and talking all the ""shop"" of ski-ing.","And, ever mysteriously blended with this power of the snow, poured also through his inner being the power of the girl.",He could not disabuse his mind of the insinuating presence of the two together.,"He remembered that queer skating-impulse of ten days ago, the impulse that had let her in.","That any mind, even an imaginative one, could pass beneath the sway of such a fancy was strange enough; and Hibbert, while fully aware of the disorder, yet found a curious joy in yielding to it.",This insubordinate centre that drew him towards old pagan beliefs had assumed command.,With a kind of sensuous pleasure he let himself be conquered.,And snow that night seemed in everybody's thoughts.,"The dancing couples talked of it; the hotel proprietors congratulated one another; it meant good sport and satisfied their guests; every one was planning trips and expeditions, talking of slopes and telemarks, of flying speed and distance, of drifts and crust and frost.","Vitality and enthusiasm pulsed in the very air; all were alert and active, positive, radiating currents of creative life even into the stuffy atmosphere of that crowded ball-room.","And the snow had caused it, the snow had brought it; all this discharge of eager sparkling energy was due primarily to the--Snow.","But in the mind of Hibbert, by some swift alchemy of his pagan yearnings, this energy became transmuted.","It rarefied itself, gleaming in white and crystal currents of passionate anticipation, which he transferred, as by a species of electrical imagination, into the personality of the girl--the Girl of the Snow.","She somewhere was waiting for him, expecting him, calling to him softly from those leagues of moonlit mountain.","He remembered the touch of that cool, dry hand; the soft and icy breath against his cheek; the hush and softness of her presence in the way she came and the way she had gone again--like a flurry of snow the wind sent gliding up the slopes.","She, like himself, belonged out there.","He fancied that he heard her little windy voice come sifting to him through the snowy branches of the trees, calling his name ... that haunting little voice that dived straight to the centre of his life as once, long years ago, two other voices used to do....",But nowhere among the costumed dancers did he see her slender figure.,"He danced with one and all, distrait and absent, a stupid partner as each girl discovered, his eyes ever turning towards the door and windows, hoping to catch the luring face, the vision that did not come ... and at length, hoping even against hope.","For the ball-room thinned;

but in anger now, no longer soft and coaxing.",And it was accompanied; she did not follow alone.,It seemed a host of these flying figures of the snow chased madly just behind him.,"He felt them furiously smite his neck and cheeks, snatch at his hands and try to entangle his feet and ski in drifts.","His eyes they blinded, and they caught his breath away.","The terror of the heights and snow and winter desolation urged him forward in the maddest race with death a human being ever knew;

his purse was short.,"He glanced at his books, letters, newspapers.",They had no interest now.,Instead he listened.,"The panorama of other journeys rolled in colour through the little room, flying on one another's heels.",Henriot enjoyed this remembered essence of his travels more than the travels themselves.,"The crying wind brought so many voices, all of them seductive: There was a soft crashing of waves upon the Black Sea shores, where the huge Caucasus beckoned in the sky beyond; a rustling in the umbrella pines and cactus at Marseilles, whence magic steamers start about the world like flying dreams.","He heard the plash of fountains upon Mount Ida's slopes, and the whisper of the tamarisk on Marathon.","It was dawn once more upon the Ionian Sea, and he smelt the perfume of the Cyclades.","Blue-veiled islands melted in the sunshine, and across the dewy lawns of Tempe, moistened by the spray of many waterfalls, he saw--Great Heavens above!--the dancing of white forms ... or was it only mist the sunshine painted against Pelion?...","""Methought, among the lawns together, we wandered underneath the young grey dawn.","And multitudes of dense white fleecy clouds shepherded by the slow, unwilling wind....""

chiefly, of course, the former.",Its invasion was concentrated through the eyes.,"And vision, thus uncorrected, went what pace it pleased.",The Desert played with him.,Sand stole into his being--through the eyes.,"And so obsessing was this majesty of its close presence, that Henriot sometimes wondered how people dared their little social activities within its very sight and hearing; how they played golf and tennis upon reclaimed edges of its face, picnicked so blithely hard upon its frontiers, and danced at night while this stern, unfathomable Thing lay breathing just beyond the trumpery walls that kept it out.","The challenge of their shallow admiration seemed presumptuous, almost provocative.",Their pursuit of pleasure suggested insolent indifference.,"They ran fool-hardy hazards, he felt; for there was no worship in their vulgar hearts.","With a mental shudder, sometimes he watched the cheap tourist horde go laughing, chattering past within view of its ancient, half-closed eyes.",It was like defying deity.,"For, to his stirred imagination the sublimity of the Desert dwarfed humanity.",These people had been wiser to choose another place for the flaunting of their tawdry insignificance.,"Any minute this Wilderness, ""huddled in grey annihilation,"" might awake and notice them ...!","In his own hotel were several ""smart,"" so-called ""Society"" people who emphasised the protest in him to the point of definite contempt.","Overdressed, the latest worldly novel under their arms, they strutted the narrow pavements of their tiny world, immensely pleased with themselves.",Their vacuous minds expressed themselves in the slang of their exclusive circle--value being the element excluded.,"The pettiness of their outlook hardly distressed him--he was too familiar with it at home--but their essential vulgarity, their innate ugliness, seemed more than usually offensive in the grandeur of its present setting.","Into the mighty sands they took the latest London scandal, gabbling it over even among the Tombs and Temples.","And ""it was to laugh,"" the pains they spent wondering whom they might condescend to know, never dreaming that they themselves were not worth knowing.",Against the background of the noble Desert their titles seemed the cap and bells of clowns.,"And Henriot, knowing some of them personally, could not always escape their insipid company.",Yet he was the gainer.,"They little guessed how their commonness heightened contrast, set mercilessly thus beside the strange, eternal beauty of the sand.","Occasionally the protest in his soul betrayed itself in words, which of course they did not understand.","""He is so clever, isn't he?""","And then, having relieved his feelings, he would comfort himself characteristically: ""The Desert has not noticed them.",The Sand is not aware of their existence.,"How should the sea take note of rubbish that lies above its tide-line?""",For Henriot drew near to its great shifting altars in an attitude of worship.,The wilderness made him kneel in heart.,"Its shining reaches led to the oldest Temple in the world, and every journey that he made was like a sacrament.",For him the Desert was a consecrated place.,It was sacred.,"And his tactful hosts, knowing his peculiarities, left their house open to him when he cared to come--they lived upon the northern edge of the oasis--and he was as free as though he were absolutely alone.",He blessed them; he rejoiced that he had come.,Little Helouan accepted him.,The Desert knew that he was there.,"*       *       *       *       * From his corner of the big dining-room he could see the other guests, but his roving eye always returned to the figure of a solitary man who sat at an adjoining table, and whose personality stirred his interest.","While affecting to look elsewhere, he studied him as closely as might be.",There was something about the stranger that touched his curiosity--a certain air of expectation that he wore.,"But it was more than that: it was anticipation, apprehension in it somewhere.","The man was nervous, uneasy.",His restless way of suddenly looking about him proved it.,"Henriot tried every one else in the room as well; but, though his thought settled on others too, he always came back to the figure of this solitary being opposite, who ate his dinner as if afraid of being seen, and glanced up sometimes as if fearful of being watched.","Henriot's curiosity, before he knew it, became suspicion.",There was mystery here.,"The table, he noticed, was laid for two.","""Is he an actor, a priest of some strange religion, an enquiry agent, or just--a crank?""",was the thought that first occurred to him.,And the question suggested itself without amusement.,The impression of subterfuge and caution he conveyed left his observer unsatisfied.,"The face was clean shaven, dark, and strong; thick hair, straight yet bushy, was slightly unkempt; it was streaked with grey; and an unexpected mobility when he smiled ran over the features that he seemed to hold rigid by deliberate effort.",The man was cut to no quite common measure.,"Henriot jumped to an intuitive conclusion: ""He's not here for pleasure or merely sight-seeing.","Something serious has brought him out to Egypt.""","For the face combined too ill-assorted qualities: an obstinate tenacity that might even mean brutality, and was certainly repulsive, yet, with it, an undecipherable dreaminess betrayed by lines of the mouth, but above all in the very light blue eyes, so rarely raised.","Those eyes, he felt, had looked upon unusual things; ""dreaminess"" was not an adequate description; ""searching"" conveyed it better.",The true source of the queer impression remained elusive.,"And hence, perhaps, the incongruous marriage in the face--mobility laid upon a matter-of-fact foundation underneath.",The face showed conflict.,"And Henriot, watching him, felt decidedly intrigued.","""I'd like to know that man, and all about him.""","His name, he learned later, was Richard Vance; from Birmingham; a business man.","But it was not the Birmingham he wished to know; it was the--other: cause of the elusive, dreamy searching.","Though facing one another at so short a distance, their eyes, however, did not meet.","And this, Henriot well knew, was a sure sign that he himself was also under observation.","Richard Vance, from Birmingham, was equally taking careful note of Felix Henriot, from London.","Thus, he could wait his time.",They would come together later.,An opportunity would certainly present itself.,"The first links in a curious chain had already caught; soon the chain would tighten, pull as though by chance, and bring their lives into one and the same circle.","Wondering in particular for what kind of a companion the second cover was laid, Henriot felt certain that their eventual coming together was inevitable.","He possessed this kind of divination from first impressions, and not uncommonly it proved correct.","Following instinct, therefore, he took no steps towards acquaintance, and for several days, owing to the fact that he dined frequently with his hosts, he saw nothing more of Richard Vance, the business man from Birmingham.","Then, one night, coming home late from his friend's house, he had passed along the great corridor, and was actually a step or so into his bedroom, when a drawling voice sounded close behind him.",It was an unpleasant sound.,"It was very near him too-- ""I beg your pardon, but have you, by any chance, such a thing as a compass you could lend me?""",The voice was so close that he started.,Vance stood within touching distance of his body.,"He had stolen up like a ghostly Arab, must have followed him, too, some little distance, for further down the passage the light of an open door--he had passed it on his way--showed where he came from.","""Eh?",I beg your pardon?,"A--compass, did you say?""",He felt disconcerted for a moment.,"How short the man was, now that he saw him standing.",Broad and powerful too.,Henriot looked down upon his thick head of hair.,The personality and voice repelled him.,"Possibly his face, caught unawares, betrayed this.","""Forgive my startling you,"" said the other apologetically, while the softer expression danced in for a moment and disorganised the rigid set of the face.","""The soft carpet, you know.",I'm afraid you didn't hear my tread.,"I wondered""--he smiled again slightly at the nature of the request--""if--by any chance--you had a pocket compass you could lend me?""","""Ah, a compass, yes!",Please don't apologise.,I believe I have one--if you'll wait a moment.,"Come in, won't you?","I'll have a look.""",The other thanked him but waited in the passage.,"Henriot, it so happened, had a compass, and produced it after a moment's search.","""I am greatly indebted to you--if I may return it in the morning.",You will forgive my disturbing you at such an hour.,"My own is broken, and I wanted--er--to find the true north.""","Henriot stammered some reply, and the man was gone.",It was all over in a minute.,He locked his door and sat down in his chair to think.,"The little incident had upset him, though for the life of him he could not imagine why.","It ought by rights to have been almost ludicrous, yet instead it was the exact reverse--half threatening.",Why should not a man want a compass?,"But, again, why should he?",And at midnight?,"The voice, the eyes, the near presence--what did they bring that set his nerves thus asking unusual questions?","This strange impression that something grave was happening, something unearthly--how was it born exactly?",The man's proximity came like a shock.,It had made him start.,"He brought--thus the idea came unbidden to his mind--something with him that galvanised him quite absurdly, as fear does, or delight, or great wonder.","There was a music in his voice too--a certain--well, he could only call it lilt, that reminded him of plainsong, intoning, chanting.",Drawling was _not_ the word at all.,"He tried to dismiss it as imagination, but it would not be dismissed.","The disturbance in himself was caused by something not imaginary, but real.","And then, for the first time, he discovered that the man had brought a faint, elusive suggestion of perfume with him, an aromatic odour, that made him think of priests and churches.",The ghost of it still lingered in the air.,"Ah, here then was the origin of the notion that his voice had chanted: it was surely the suggestion of incense.","But incense, intoning, a compass to find the true north--at midnight in a Desert hotel!",A touch of uneasiness ran through the curiosity and excitement that he felt.,And he undressed for bed.,"""Confound my old imagination,"" he thought, ""what tricks it plays me!","It'll keep me awake!""","But the questions, once started in his mind, continued.","He must find explanation of one kind or another before he could lie down and sleep, and he found it at length in--the stars.",The man was an astronomer of sorts; possibly an astrologer into the bargain!,Why not?,The stars were wonderful above Helouan.,"Was there not an observatory on the Mokattam Hills, too, where tourists could use the telescopes on privileged days?",He had it at last.,He even stole out on to his balcony to see if the stranger perhaps was looking through some wonderful apparatus at the heavens.,Their rooms were on the same side.,But the shuttered windows revealed no stooping figure with eyes glued to a telescope.,The stars blinked in their many thousands down upon the silent desert.,The night held neither sound nor movement.,There was a cool breeze blowing across the Nile from the Lybian Sands.,It nipped; and he stepped back quickly into the room again.,"Drawing the mosquito curtains carefully about the bed, he put the light out and turned over to sleep.","And sleep came quickly, contrary to his expectations, though it was a light and surface sleep.","That last glimpse of the darkened Desert lying beneath the Egyptian stars had touched him with some hand of awful power that ousted the first, lesser excitement.","It calmed and soothed him in one sense, yet in another, a sense he could not understand, it caught him in a net of deep, deep feelings whose mesh, while infinitely delicate, was utterly stupendous.",His nerves this deeper emotion left alone: it reached instead to something infinite in him that mere nerves could neither deal with nor interpret.,The soul awoke and whispered in him while his body slept.,"And the little, foolish dreams that ran to and fro across this veil of surface sleep brought oddly tangled pictures of things quite tiny and at the same time of others that were mighty beyond words.",With these two counters Nightmare played.,They interwove.,"There was the figure of this dark-faced man with the compass, measuring the sky to find the true north, and there were hints of giant Presences that hovered just outside some curious outline that he traced upon the ground, copied in some nightmare fashion from the heavens.",The excitement caused by his visitor's singular request mingled with the profounder sensations his final look at the stars and Desert stirred.,The two were somehow inter-related.,"Some hours later, before this surface sleep passed into genuine slumber, Henriot woke--with an appalling feeling that the Desert had come creeping into his room and now stared down upon him where he lay in bed.",The wind was crying audibly about the walls outside.,"A faint, sharp tapping came against the window panes.","He sprang instantly out of bed, not yet awake enough to feel actual alarm, yet with the nightmare touch still close enough to cause a sort of feverish, loose bewilderment.",He switched the lights on.,"A moment later he knew the meaning of that curious tapping, for the rising wind was flinging tiny specks of sand against the glass.","The idea that they had summoned him belonged, of course, to dream.","He opened the window, and stepped out on to the balcony.",The stone was very cold under his bare feet.,There was a wash of wind all over him.,"He saw the sheet of glimmering, pale desert near and far; and something stung his skin below the eyes.","""The sand,"" he whispered, ""again the sand; always the sand.","Waking or sleeping, the sand is everywhere--nothing but sand, sand, Sand...."" He rubbed his eyes.","It was like talking in his sleep, talking to Someone who had questioned him just before he woke.",But was he really properly awake?,It seemed next day that he had dreamed it.,"Something enormous, with rustling skirts of sand, had just retreated far into the Desert.","Sand went with it--flowing, trailing, smothering the world.",The wind died down.,"And Henriot went back to sleep, caught instantly away into unconsciousness; covered, blinded, swept over by this spreading thing of reddish brown with the great, grey face, whose Being was colossal yet quite tiny, and whose fingers, wings and eyes were countless as the stars.","But all night long it watched and waited, rising to peer above the little balcony, and sometimes entering the room and piling up beside his very pillow.",He dreamed of Sand.,III For some days Henriot saw little of the man who came from Birmingham and pushed curiosity to a climax by asking for a compass in the middle of the night.,"For one thing, he was a good deal with his friends upon the other side of Helouan, and for another, he slept several nights in the Desert.",He loved the gigantic peace the Desert gave him.,"The world was forgotten there; and not the world merely, but all memory of it.",Everything faded out.,The soul turned inwards upon itself.,"An Arab boy and donkey took out sleeping-bag, food and water to the Wadi Hof, a desolate gorge about an hour eastwards.",It winds between cliffs whose summits rise some thousand feet above the sea.,"It opens suddenly, cut deep into the swaying world of level plateaux and undulating hills.",It moves about too; he never found it in the same place twice--like an arm of the Desert that shifted with the changing lights.,"Here he watched dawns and sunsets, slept through the mid-day heat, and enjoyed the unearthly colouring that swept Day and Night across the huge horizons.",In solitude the Desert soaked down into him.,"At night the jackals cried in the darkness round his cautiously-fed camp fire--small, because wood had to be carried--and in the day-time kites circled overhead to inspect him, and an occasional white vulture flapped across the blue.","The weird desolation of this rocky valley, he thought, was like the scenery of the moon.","He took no watch with him, and the arrival of the donkey boy an hour after sunrise came almost from another planet, bringing things of time and common life out of some distant gulf where they had lain forgotten among lost ages.","The short hour of twilight brought, too, a bewitchment into the silence that was a little less than comfortable.","Full light or darkness he could manage, but this time of half things made him want to shut his eyes and hide.",Its effect stepped over imagination.,The mind got lost.,He could not understand it.,For the cliffs and boulders of discoloured limestone shone then with an inward glow that signalled to the Desert with veiled lanterns.,"The misshappen hills, carved by wind and rain into ominous outlines, stirred and nodded.","In the morning light they retired into themselves, asleep.",But at dusk the tide retreated.,"They rose from the sea, emerging naked, threatening.","They ran together and joined shoulders, the entire army of them.","And the glow of their sandy bodies, self-luminous, continued even beneath the stars.",Only the moonlight drowned it.,"For the moonrise over the Mokattam Hills brought a white, grand loveliness that drenched the entire Desert.",It drew a marvellous sweetness from the sand.,"It shone across a world as yet unfinished, whereon no life might show itself for ages yet to come.","He was alone then upon an empty star, before the creation of things that breathed and moved.","What impressed him, however, more than everything else was the enormous vitality that rose out of all this apparent death.","There was no hint of the melancholy that belongs commonly to flatness; the sadness of wide, monotonous landscape was not here.",The endless repetition of sweeping vale and plateau brought infinity within measurable comprehension.,"He grasped a definite meaning in the phrase ""world without end"": the Desert had no end and no beginning.","It gave him a sense of eternal peace, the silent peace that star-fields know.","Instead of subduing the soul with bewilderment, it inspired with courage, confidence, hope.","Through this sand which was the wreck of countless geological ages, rushed life that was terrific and uplifting, too huge to include melancholy, too deep to betray itself in movement.",Here was the stillness of eternity.,"Behind the spread grey masque of apparent death lay stores of accumulated life, ready to break forth at any point.",In the Desert he felt himself absolutely royal.,"And this contrast of Life, veiling itself in Death, was a contradiction that somehow intoxicated.",The Desert exhilaration never left him.,He was never alone.,"A companionship of millions went with him, and he _felt_ the Desert close, as stars are close to one another, or grains of sand.","It was the Khamasin, the hot wind bringing sand, that drove him in--with the feeling that these few days and nights had been immeasurable, and that he had been away a thousand years.","He came back with the magic of the Desert in his blood, hotel-life tasteless and insipid by comparison.",To human impressions thus he was fresh and vividly sensitive.,"His being, cleaned and sensitized by pure grandeur, ""felt"" people--for a time at any rate--with an uncommon sharpness of receptive judgment.","He returned to a life somehow mean and meagre, resuming insignificance with his dinner jacket.","Out with the sand he had been regal; now, like a slave, he strutted self-conscious and reduced.","But this imperial standard of the Desert stayed a little time beside him, its purity focussing judgment like a lens.","The specks of smaller emotions left it clear at first, and as his eye wandered vaguely over the people assembled in the dining-room, it was arrested with a vivid shock upon two figures at the little table facing him.","He had forgotten Vance, the Birmingham man who sought the North at midnight with a pocket compass.","He now saw him again, with an intuitive discernment entirely fresh.","Before memory brought up her clouding associations, some brilliance flashed a light upon him.","""That man,"" Henriot thought, ""might have come with me.","He would have understood and loved it!""","But the thought was really this--a moment's reflection spread it, rather: ""He belongs somewhere to the Desert; the Desert brought him out here.""","And, again, hidden swiftly behind it like a movement running below water--""What does he want with it?",What is the deeper motive he conceals?,"For there is a deeper motive; and it _is_ concealed.""","But it was the woman seated next him who absorbed his attention really, even while this thought flashed and went its way.",The empty chair was occupied at last.,"Unlike his first encounter with the man, she looked straight at him.",Their eyes met fully.,"For several seconds there was steady mutual inspection, while her penetrating stare, intent without being rude, passed searchingly all over his face.",It was disconcerting.,"Crumbling his bread, he looked equally hard at her, unable to turn away, determined not to be the first to shift his gaze.","And when at length she lowered her eyes he felt that many things had happened, as in a long period of intimate conversation.",Her mind had judged him through and through.,Questions and answer flashed.,They were no longer strangers.,"For the rest of dinner, though he was careful to avoid direct inspection, he was aware that she felt his presence and was secretly speaking with him.",She asked questions beneath her breath.,The answers rose with the quickened pulses in his blood.,"Moreover, she explained Richard Vance.",It was this woman's power that shone reflected in the man.,"She was the one who knew the big, unusual things.",Vance merely echoed the rush of her vital personality.,"This was the first impression that he got--from the most striking, curious face he had ever seen in a woman.","It remained very near him all through the meal: she had moved to his table, it seemed she sat beside him.",Their minds certainly knew contact from that moment.,"It is never difficult to credit strangers with the qualities and knowledge that oneself craves for, and no doubt Henriot's active fancy went busily to work.","But, none the less, this thing remained and grew: that this woman was aware of the hidden things of Egypt he had always longed to know.",There was knowledge and guidance she could impart.,Her soul was searching among ancient things.,Her face brought the Desert back into his thoughts.,And with it came--the sand.,Here was the flash.,The sight of her restored the peace and splendour he had left behind him in his Desert camps.,"The rest, of course, was what his imagination constructed upon this slender basis.","Only,--not all of it was imagination.","Now, Henriot knew little enough of women, and had no pose of ""understanding"" them.",His experience was of the slightest; the love and veneration felt for his own mother had set the entire sex upon the heights.,"His affairs with women, if so they may be called, had been transient--all but those of early youth, which having never known the devastating test of fulfilment, still remained ideal and superb.","There was unconscious humour in his attitude--from a distance; for he regarded women with wonder and respect, as puzzles that sweetened but complicated life, might even endanger it.",He certainly was not a marrying man!,"But now, as he felt the presence of this woman so deliberately possess him, there came over him two clear, strong messages, each vivid with certainty.","One was that banal suggestion of familiarity claimed by lovers and the like--he had often heard of it--""I have known that woman before; I have met her ages ago somewhere; she is strangely familiar to me""; and the other, growing out of it almost: ""Have nothing to do with her; she will bring you trouble and confusion; avoid her, and be warned"";--in fact, a distinct presentiment.","Yet, although Henriot dismissed both impressions as having no shred of evidence to justify them, the original clear judgment, as he studied her extraordinary countenance, persisted through all denials The familiarity, and the presentiment, remained.","There also remained this other--an enormous imaginative leap!--that she could teach him ""Egypt.""","He watched her carefully, in a sense fascinated.","He could only describe the face as black, so dark it was with the darkness of great age.","Elderly was the obvious, natural word; but elderly described the features only.",The expression of the face wore centuries.,"Nor was it merely the coal-black eyes that betrayed an ancient, age-travelled soul behind them.",The entire presentment mysteriously conveyed it.,This woman's heart knew long-forgotten things--the thought kept beating up against him.,"There were cheek-bones, oddly high, that made him think involuntarily of the well-advertised Pharaoh, Ramases; a square, deep jaw; and an aquiline nose that gave the final touch of power.","For the power undeniably was there, and while the general effect had grimness in it, there was neither harshness nor any forbidding touch about it.","There was an implacable sternness in the set of lips and jaw, and, most curious of all, the eyelids over the steady eyes of black were level as a ruler.",This level framing made the woman's stare remarkable beyond description.,"Henriot thought of an idol carved in stone, stone hard and black, with eyes that stared across the sand into a world of things non-human, very far away, forgotten of men.",The face was finely ugly.,This strange dark beauty flashed flame about it.,"And, as the way ever was with him, Henriot next fell to constructing the possible lives of herself and her companion, though without much success.",Imagination soon stopped dead.,"She was not old enough to be Vance's mother, and assuredly she was not his wife.",His interest was more than merely piqued--it was puzzled uncommonly.,What was the contrast that made the man seem beside her--vile?,"Whence came, too, the impression that she exercised some strong authority, though never directly exercised, that held him at her mercy?","How did he guess that the man resented it, yet did not dare oppose, and that, apparently acquiescing good-humouredly, his will was deliberately held in abeyance, and that he waited sulkily, biding his time?",There was furtiveness in every gesture and expression.,A hidden motive lurked in him; unworthiness somewhere; he was determined yet ashamed.,He watched her ceaselessly and with such uncanny closeness.,Henriot imagined he divined all this.,He leaped to the guess that his expenses were being paid.,A good deal more was being paid besides.,"She was a rich relation, from whom he had expectations; he was serving his seven years, ashamed of his servitude, ever calculating escape--but, perhaps, no ordinary escape.",A faint shudder ran over him.,He drew in the reins of imagination.,"Of course, the probabilities were that he was hopelessly astray--one usually is on such occasions--but this time, it so happened, he was singularly right.",Before one thing only his ready invention stopped every time.,"This vileness, this notion of unworthiness in Vance, could not be negative merely.",A man with that face was no inactive weakling.,"The motive he was at such pains to conceal, betraying its existence by that very fact, moved, surely, towards aggressive action.","Disguised, it never slept.",Vance was sharply on the alert.,He had a plan deep out of sight.,And Henriot remembered how the man's soft approach along the carpeted corridor had made him start.,He recalled the quasi shock it gave him.,He thought again of the feeling of discomfort he had experienced.,"Next, his eager fancy sought to plumb the business these two had together in Egypt--in the Desert.","For the Desert, he felt convinced, had brought them out.","But here, though he constructed numerous explanations, another barrier stopped him.",Because he _knew_.,"This woman was in touch with that aspect of ancient Egypt he himself had ever sought in vain; and not merely with stones the sand had buried so deep, but with the meanings they once represented, buried so utterly by the sands of later thought.","And here, being ignorant, he found no clue that could lead to any satisfactory result, for he possessed no knowledge that might guide him.",He floundered--until Fate helped him.,"And the instant Fate helped him, the warning and presentiment he had dismissed as fanciful, became real again.",He hesitated.,Caution acted.,He would think twice before taking steps to form acquaintance.,"""Better not,"" thought whispered.","""Better leave them alone, this queer couple.","They're after things that won't do you any good.""","This idea of mischief, almost of danger, in their purposes was oddly insistent; for what could possibly convey it?","But, while he hesitated, Fate, who sent the warning, pushed him at the same time into the circle of their lives: at first tentatively--he might still have escaped; but soon urgently--curiosity led him inexorably towards the end.",IV It was so simple a manoeuvre by which Fate began the innocent game.,"The woman left a couple of books behind her on the table one night, and Henriot, after a moment's hesitation, took them out after her.","He knew the titles--_The House of the Master_, and _The House of the Hidden Places_, both singular interpretations of the Pyramids that once had held his own mind spellbound.","Their ideas had been since disproved, if he remembered rightly, yet the titles were a clue--a clue to that imaginative part of his mind that was so busy constructing theories and had found its stride.","Loose sheets of paper, covered with notes in a minute handwriting, lay between the pages; but these, of course, he did not read, noticing only that they were written round designs of various kinds--intricate designs.",He discovered Vance in a corner of the smoking-lounge.,The woman had disappeared.,Vance thanked him politely.,"""My aunt is so forgetful sometimes,"" he said, and took them with a covert eagerness that did not escape the other's observation.",He folded up the sheets and put them carefully in his pocket.,"On one there was an ink-sketched map, crammed with detail, that might well have referred to some portion of the Desert.",The points of the compass stood out boldly at the bottom.,There were involved geometrical designs again.,Henriot saw them.,"They exchanged, then, the commonplaces of conversation, but these led to nothing further.",Vance was nervous and betrayed impatience.,He presently excused himself and left the lounge.,"Ten minutes later he passed through the outer hall, the woman beside him, and the pair of them, wrapped up in cloak and ulster, went out into the night.","At the door, Vance turned and threw a quick, investigating glance in his direction.",There seemed a hint of questioning in that glance; it might almost have been a tentative invitation.,"But, also, he wanted to see if their exit had been particularly noticed--and by whom.","This, briefly told, was the first manoeuvre by which Fate introduced them.",There was nothing in it.,"The details were so insignificant, so slight the conversation, so meagre the pieces thus added to Henriot's imaginative structure.",Yet they somehow built it up and made it solid; the outline in his mind began to stand foursquare.,"That writing, those designs, the manner of the man, their going out together, the final curious look--each and all betrayed points of a hidden thing.",Subconsciously he was excavating their buried purposes.,The sand was shifting.,The concentration of his mind incessantly upon them removed it grain by grain and speck by speck.,Tips of the smothered thing emerged.,Presently a subsidence would follow with a rush and light would blaze upon its skeleton.,"He felt it stirring underneath his feet--this flowing movement of light, dry, heaped-up sand.",It was always--sand.,"Then other incidents of a similar kind came about, clearing the way to a natural acquaintanceship.","Henriot watched the process with amusement, yet with another feeling too that was only a little less than anxiety.","A keen observer, no detail escaped him; he saw the forces of their lives draw closer.","It made him think of the devices of young people who desire to know one another, yet cannot get a proper introduction.",Fate condescended to such little tricks.,"They wanted a third person, he began to feel.","A third was necessary to some plan they had on hand, and--they waited to see if he could fill the place.","This woman, with whom he had yet exchanged no single word, seemed so familiar to him, well known for years.","They weighed and watched him, wondering if he would do.","None of the devices were too obviously used, but at length Henriot picked up so many forgotten articles, and heard so many significant phrases, casually let fall, that he began to feel like the villain in a machine-made play, where the hero for ever drops clues his enemy is intended to discover.",Introduction followed inevitably.,"""My aunt can tell you; she knows Arabic perfectly.""","He had been discussing the meaning of some local name or other with a neighbour after dinner, and Vance had joined them.","The neighbour moved away; these two were left standing alone, and he accepted a cigarette from the other's case.",There was a rustle of skirts behind them.,"""Here she comes,"" said Vance; ""you will let me introduce you.""","He did not ask for Henriot's name; he had already taken the trouble to find it out--another little betrayal, and another clue.","It was in a secluded corner of the great hall, and Henriot turned to see the woman's stately figure coming towards them across the thick carpet that deadened her footsteps.","She came sailing up, her black eyes fixed upon his face.","Very erect, head upright, shoulders almost squared, she moved wonderfully well; there was dignity and power in her walk.","She was dressed in black, and her face was like the night.",He found it impossible to say what lent her this air of impressiveness and solemnity that was almost majestic.,"But there _was_ this touch of darkness and of power in the way she came that made him think of some sphinx-like figure of stone, some idol motionless in all its parts but moving as a whole, and gliding across--sand.",Beneath those level lids her eyes stared hard at him.,"And a faint sensation of distress stirred in him deep, deep down.",Where had he seen those eyes before?,"He bowed, as she joined them, and Vance led the way to the armchairs in a corner of the lounge.","The meeting, as the talk that followed, he felt, were all part of a preconceived plan.",It had happened before.,"The woman, that is, was familiar to him--to some part of his being that had dropped stitches of old, old memory.",Lady Statham!,At first the name had disappointed him.,"So many folk wear titles, as syllables in certain tongues wear accents--without them being mute, unnoticed, unpronounced.","Nonentities, born to names, so often claim attention for their insignificance in this way.","But this woman, had she been Jemima Jones, would have made the name distinguished and select.",She was a big and sombre personality.,"Why was it, he wondered afterwards, that for a moment something in him shrank, and that his mind, metaphorically speaking, flung up an arm in self-protection?",The instinct flashed and passed.,"But it seemed to him born of an automatic feeling that he must protect--not himself, but the woman from the man.",There was confusion in it all; links were missing.,He studied her intently.,"She was a woman who had none of the external feminine signals in either dress or manner, no graces, no little womanly hesitations and alarms, no daintiness, yet neither anything distinctly masculine.","Her charm was strong, possessing; only he kept forgetting that he was talking to a--woman; and the thing she inspired in him included, with respect and wonder, somewhere also this curious hint of dread.","This instinct to protect her fled as soon as it was born, for the interest of the conversation in which she so quickly plunged him obliterated all minor emotions whatsoever.","Here, for the first time, he drew close to Egypt, the Egypt he had sought so long.",It was not to be explained.,He _felt_ it.,"Beginning with commonplaces, such as ""You like Egypt?","You find here what you expected?""","she led him into better regions with ""One finds here what one brings.""","He knew the delightful experience of talking fluently on subjects he was at home in, and to some one who understood.","The feeling at first that to this woman he could not say mere anythings, slipped into its opposite--that he could say everything.","Strangers ten minutes ago, they were at once in deep and intimate talk together.","He found his ideas readily followed, agreed with up to a point--the point which permits discussion to start from a basis of general accord towards speculation.","In the excitement of ideas he neglected the uncomfortable note that had stirred his caution, forgot the warning too.","Her mind, moreover, seemed known to him; he was often aware of what she was going to say before he actually heard it; the current of her thoughts struck a familiar gait, and more than once he experienced vividly again the odd sensation that it all had happened before.",The very sentences and phrases with which she pointed the turns of her unusual ideas were never wholly unexpected.,"For her ideas were decidedly unusual, in the sense that she accepted without question speculations not commonly deemed worth consideration at all, indeed not ordinarily even known.","Henriot knew them, because he had read in many fields.",It was the strength of her belief that fascinated him.,She offered no apologies.,She knew.,"And while he talked, she listening with folded arms and her black eyes fixed upon his own, Richard Vance watched with vigilant eyes and listened too, ceaselessly alert.","Vance joined in little enough, however, gave no opinions, his attitude one of general acquiescence.","Twice, when pauses of slackening interest made it possible, Henriot fancied he surprised another quality in this negative attitude.","Interpreting it each time differently, he yet dismissed both interpretations with a smile.",His imagination leaped so absurdly to violent conclusions.,"They were not tenable: Vance was neither her keeper, nor was he in some fashion a detective.",Yet in his manner was sometimes this suggestion of the detective order.,"He watched with such deep attention, and he concealed it so clumsily with an affectation of careless indifference.","There is nothing more dangerous than that impulsive intimacy strangers sometimes adopt when an atmosphere of mutual sympathy takes them by surprise, for it is akin to the false frankness friends affect when telling ""candidly"" one another's faults.",The mood is invariably regretted later.,"Henriot, however, yielded to it now with something like abandon.","The pleasure of talking with this woman was so unexpected, and so keen.",For Lady Statham believed apparently in some Egypt of her dreams.,"Her interest was neither historical, archaeological, nor political.",It was religious--yet hardly of this earth at all.,"The conversation turned upon the knowledge of the ancient Egyptians from an unearthly point of view, and even while he talked he was vaguely aware that it was _her_ mind talking through his own.",She drew out his ideas and made him say them.,"But this he was properly aware of only afterwards--that she had cleverly, mercilessly pumped him of all he had ever known or read upon the subject.","Moreover, what Vance watched so intently was himself, and the reactions in himself this remarkable woman produced.",That also he realised later.,"His first impression that these two belonged to what may be called the ""crank"" order was justified by the conversation.","But, at least, it was interesting crankiness, and the belief behind it made it even fascinating.","Long before the end he surprised in her a more vital form of his own attitude that anything _may_ be true, since knowledge has never yet found final answers to any of the biggest questions.","He understood, from sentences dropped early in the talk, that she was among those few ""superstitious"" folk who think that the old Egyptians came closer to reading the eternal riddles of the world than any others, and that their knowledge was a remnant of that ancient Wisdom Religion which existed in the superb, dark civilization of the sunken Atlantis, lost continent that once joined Africa to Mexico.","Eighty thousand years ago the dim sands of Poseidonis, great island adjoining the main continent which itself had vanished a vast period before, sank down beneath the waves, and the entire known world to-day was descended from its survivors.","Hence the significant fact that all religions and ""mythological"" systems begin with a story of a flood--some cataclysmic upheaval that destroyed the world.","Egypt itself was colonised by a group of Atlantean priests who brought their curious, deep knowledge with them.",They had foreseen the cataclysm.,"Lady Statham talked well, bringing into her great dream this strong, insistent quality of belief and fact.","She knew, from Plato to Donelly, all that the minds of men have ever speculated upon the gorgeous legend.",The evidence for such a sunken continent--Henriot had skimmed it too in years gone by--she made bewilderingly complete.,He had heard Baconians demolish Shakespeare with an array of evidence equally overwhelming.,It catches the imagination though not the mind.,"Yet out of her facts, as she presented them, grew a strange likelihood.","The force of this woman's personality, and her calm and quiet way of believing all she talked about, took her listener to some extent--further than ever before, certainly--into the great dream after her.","And the dream, to say the least, was a picturesque one, laden with wonderful possibilities.","For as she talked the spirit of old Egypt moved up, staring down upon him out of eyes lidded so curiously level.","Hitherto all had prated to him of the Arabs, their ancient faith and customs, and the splendour of the Bedouins, those Princes of the Desert.","But what he sought, barely confessed in words even to himself, was something older far than this.","And this strange, dark woman brought it close.","Deeps in his soul, long slumbering, awoke.",He heard forgotten questions.,Only in this brief way could he attempt to sum up the storm she roused in him.,"She carried him far beyond mere outline, however, though afterwards he recalled the details with difficulty.",So much more was suggested than actually expressed.,She contrived to make the general modern scepticism an evidence of cheap mentality.,"It was so easy; the depth it affects to conceal, mere emptiness.","""We have tried all things, and found all wanting""--the mind, as measuring instrument, merely confessed inadequate.","Various shrewd judgments of this kind increased his respect, although her acceptance went so far beyond his own.","And, while the label of credulity refused to stick to her, her sense of imaginative wonder enabled her to escape that dreadful compromise, a man's mind in a woman's temperament.",She fascinated him.,"The spiritual worship of the ancient Egyptians, she held, was a symbolical explanation of things generally alluded to as the secrets of life and death; their knowledge was a remnant of the wisdom of Atlantis.","Material relics, equally misunderstood, still stood to-day at Karnac, Stonehenge, and in the mysterious writings on buried Mexican temples and cities, so significantly akin to the hieroglyphics upon the Egyptian tombs.","""The one misinterpreted as literally as the other,"" she suggested, ""yet both fragments of an advanced knowledge that found its grave in the sea.","The Wisdom of that old spiritual system has vanished from the world, only a degraded literalism left of its undecipherable language.","The jewel has been lost, and the casket is filled with sand, sand, sand.""","How keenly her black eyes searched his own as she said it, and how oddly she made the little word resound.",The syllable drew out almost into chanting.,"Echoes answered from the depths within him, carrying it on and on across some desert of forgotten belief.",Veils of sand flew everywhere about his mind.,Curtains lifted.,Whole hills of sand went shifting into level surfaces whence gardens of dim outline emerged to meet the sunlight.,"""But the sand may be removed.""","It was her nephew, speaking almost for the first time, and the interruption had an odd effect, introducing a sharply practical element.","For the tone expressed, so far as he dared express it, disapproval.","It was a baited observation, an invitation to opinion.","""We are not sand-diggers, Mr. Henriot,"" put in Lady Statham, before he decided to respond.","""Our object is quite another one; and I believe--I have a feeling,"" she added almost questioningly, ""that you might be interested enough to help us perhaps.""",He only wondered the direct attack had not come sooner.,Its bluntness hardly surprised him.,He felt himself leap forward to accept it.,A sudden subsidence had freed his feet.,Then the warning operated suddenly--for an instant.,"Henriot _was_ interested; more, he was half seduced; but, as yet, he did not mean to be included in their purposes, whatever these might be.","That shrinking dread came back a moment, and was gone again before he could question it.",His eyes looked full at Lady Statham.,"""What is it that you know?""",they asked her.,"""Tell me the things we once knew together, you and I.",These words are merely trifling.,And why does another man now stand in my place?,"For the sands heaped upon my memory are shifting, and it is _you_ who are moving them away.""","His soul whispered it; his voice said quite another thing, although the words he used seemed oddly chosen: ""There is much in the ideas of ancient Egypt that has attracted me ever since I can remember, though I have never caught up with anything definite enough to follow.","There was majesty somewhere in their conceptions--a large, calm majesty of spiritual dominion, one might call it perhaps.","I _am_ interested.""","Her face remained expressionless as she listened, but there was grave conviction in the eyes that held him like a spell.","He saw through them into dim, faint pictures whose background was always sand.","He forgot that he was speaking with a woman, a woman who half an hour ago had been a stranger to him.","He followed these faded mental pictures, though he never caught them up....",It was like his dream in London.,"Lady Statham was talking--he had not noticed the means by which she effected the abrupt transition--of familiar beliefs of old Egypt; of the Ka, or Double, by whose existence the survival of the soul was possible, even its return into manifested, physical life; of the astrology, or influence of the heavenly bodies upon all sublunar activities; of terrific forms of other life, known to the ancient worship of Atlantis, great Potencies that might be invoked by ritual and ceremonial, and of their lesser influence as recognised in certain lower forms, hence treated with veneration as the ""Sacred Animal"" branch of this dim religion.","And she spoke lightly of the modern learning which so glibly imagined it was the animals themselves that were looked upon as ""gods""--the bull, the bird, the crocodile, the cat.","""It's there they all go so absurdly wrong,"" she said, ""taking the symbol for the power symbolised.",Yet natural enough.,"The mind to-day wears blinkers, studies only the details seen directly before it.","Had none of us experienced love, we should think the first lover mad.","Few to-day know the Powers _they_ knew, hence deny them.","If the world were deaf it would stand with mockery before a hearing group swayed by an orchestra, pitying both listeners and performers.",It would deem our admiration of a great swinging bell mere foolish worship of form and movement.,"Similarly, with high Powers that once expressed themselves in common forms--where best they could--being themselves bodiless.",The learned men classify the forms with painstaking detail.,But deity has gone out of life.,"The Powers symbolised are no longer experienced.""","""These Powers, you suggest, then--their Kas, as it were--may still--"" But she waved aside the interruption.","""They are satisfied, as the common people were, with a degraded literalism,"" she went on.","""Nut was the Heavens, who spread herself across the earth in the form of a woman; Shu, the vastness of space; the ibis typified Thoth, and Hathor was the Patron of the Western Hills; Khonsu, the moon, was personified, as was the deity of the Nile.","But the high priest of Ra, the sun, you notice, remained ever the Great One of Visions.""","The High Priest, the Great One of Visions!--How wonderfully again she made the sentence sing.",She put splendour into it.,The pictures shifted suddenly closer in his mind.,He saw the grandeur of Memphis and Heliopolis rise against the stars and shake the sand of ages from their stern old temples.,"""You think it possible, then, to get into touch with these High Powers you speak of, Powers once manifested in common forms?""",Henriot asked the question with a degree of conviction and solemnity that surprised himself.,The scenery changed about him as he listened.,The spacious halls of this former khedivial Palace melted into Desert spaces.,"He smelt the open wilderness, the sand that haunted Helouan.",The soft-footed Arab servants moved across the hall in their white sheets like eddies of dust the wind stirred from the Libyan dunes.,"And over these two strangers close beside him stole a queer, indefinite alteration.","Moods and emotions, nameless as unknown stars, rose through his soul, trailing dark mists of memory from unfathomable distances.",Lady Statham answered him indirectly.,He found himself wishing that those steady eyes would sometimes close.,"""Love is known only by feeling it,"" she said, her voice deepening a little.","""Behind the form you feel the person loved.","The process is an evocation, pure and simple.","An arduous ceremonial, involving worship and devotional preparation, is the means.",It is a difficult ritual--the only one acknowledged by the world as still effectual.,"Ritual is the passage way of the soul into the Infinite.""",He might have said the words himself.,The thought lay in him while she uttered it.,Evocation everywhere in life was as true as assimilation.,"Nevertheless, he stared his companion full in the eyes with a touch of almost rude amazement.","But no further questions prompted themselves; or, rather, he declined to ask them.","He recalled, somehow uneasily, that in ceremonial the points of the compass have significance, standing for forces and activities that sleep there until invoked, and a passing light fell upon that curious midnight request in the corridor upstairs.","These two were on the track of undesirable experiments, he thought....",They wished to include him too.,"""You go at night sometimes into the Desert?""",he heard himself saying.,It was impulsive and miscalculated.,His feeling that it would be wise to change the conversation resulted in giving it fresh impetus instead.,"""We saw you there--in the Wadi Hof,"" put in Vance, suddenly breaking his long silence; ""you too sleep out, then?","It means, you know, the Valley of Fear.""","""We wondered--"" It was Lady Statham's voice, and she leaned forward eagerly as she said it, then abruptly left the sentence incomplete.",Henriot started; a sense of momentary acute discomfort again ran over him.,"The same second she continued, though obviously changing the phrase--""we wondered how you spent your day there, during the heat.","But you paint, don't you?","You draw, I mean?""","The commonplace question, he realised in every fibre of his being, meant something _they_ deemed significant.",Was it his talent for drawing that they sought to use him for?,"Even as he answered with a simple affirmative, he had a flash of intuition that might be fanciful, yet that might be true: that this extraordinary pair were intent upon some ceremony of evocation that should summon into actual physical expression some Power--some type of life--known long ago to ancient worship, and that they even sought to fix its bodily outline with the pencil--his pencil.",A gateway of incredible adventure opened at his feet.,He balanced on the edge of knowing unutterable things.,Here was a clue that might lead him towards the hidden Egypt he had ever craved to know.,An awful hand was beckoning.,The sands were shifting.,He saw the million eyes of the Desert watching him from beneath the level lids of centuries.,"Speck by speck, and grain by grain, the sand that smothered memory lifted the countless wrappings that embalmed it.","And he was willing, yet afraid.",Why in the world did he hesitate and shrink?,"Why was it that the presence of this silent, watching personality in the chair beside him kept caution still alive, with warning close behind?",The pictures in his mind were gorgeously coloured.,It was Richard Vance who somehow streaked them through with black.,"A thing of darkness, born of this man's unassertive presence, flitted ever across the scenery, marring its grandeur with something evil, petty, dreadful.",He held a horrible thought alive.,His mind was thinking venal purposes.,"In Henriot himself imagination had grown curiously heated, fed by what had been suggested rather than actually said.","Ideas of immensity crowded his brain, yet never assumed definite shape.","They were familiar, even as this strange woman was familiar.","Once, long ago, he had known them well; had even practised them beneath these bright Egyptian stars.","Whence came this prodigious glad excitement in his heart, this sense of mighty Powers coaxed down to influence the very details of daily life?","Behind them, for all their vagueness, lay an archetypal splendour, fraught with forgotten meanings.","He had always been aware of it in this mysterious land, but it had ever hitherto eluded him.",It hovered everywhere.,"He had felt it brooding behind the towering Colossi at Thebes, in the skeletons of wasted temples, in the uncouth comeliness of the Sphinx, and in the crude terror of the Pyramids even.",Over the whole of Egypt hung its invisible wings.,These were but isolated fragments of the Body that might express it.,"And the Desert remained its cleanest, truest symbol.",Sand knew it closest.,Sand might even give it bodily form and outline.,"But, while it escaped description in his mind, as equally it eluded visualisation in his soul, he felt that it combined with its vastness something infinitely small as well.","Of such wee particles is the giant Desert born.... Henriot started nervously in his chair, convicted once more of unconscionable staring; and at the same moment a group of hotel people, returning from a dance, passed through the hall and nodded him good-night.",The scent of the women reached him; and with it the sound of their voices discussing personalities just left behind.,A London atmosphere came with them.,"He caught trivial phrases, uttered in a drawling tone, and followed by the shrill laughter of a girl.","They passed upstairs, discussing their little things, like marionettes upon a tiny stage.","But their passage brought him back to things of modern life, and to some standard of familiar measurement.","The pictures that his soul had gazed at so deep within, he realised, were a pictorial transfer caught incompletely from this woman's vivid mind.","He had seen the Desert as the grey, enormous Tomb where hovered still the Ka of ancient Egypt.",Sand screened her visage with the veil of centuries.,"But She was there, and She was living.","Egypt herself had pitched a temporary camp in him, and then moved on.","There was a momentary break, a sense of abruptness and dislocation.","And then he became aware that Lady Statham had been speaking for some time before he caught her actual words, and that a certain change had come into her voice as also into her manner.","V She was leaning closer to him, her face suddenly glowing and alive.",Through the stone figure coursed the fires of a passion that deepened the coal-black eyes and communicated a hint of light--of exaltation--to her whole person.,It was incredibly moving.,To this deep passion was due the power he had felt.,"It was her entire life; she lived for it, she would die for it.",Her calmness of manner enhanced its effect.,Hence the strength of those first impressions that had stormed him.,"The woman had belief; however wild and strange, it was sacred to her.",The secret of her influence was--conviction.,His attitude shifted several points then.,The wonder in him passed over into awe.,The things she knew were real.,They were not merely imaginative speculations.,"""I knew I was not wrong in thinking you in sympathy with this line of thought,"" she was saying in lower voice, steady with earnestness, and as though she had read his mind.","""You, too, know, though perhaps you hardly realise that you know.",It lies so deep in you that you only get vague feelings of it--intimations of memory.,"Isn't that the case?""",Henriot gave assent with his eyes; it was the truth.,"""What we know instinctively,"" she continued, ""is simply what we are trying to remember.","Knowledge is memory.""",She paused a moment watching his face closely.,"""At least, you are free from that cheap scepticism which labels these old beliefs as superstition.""",It was not even a question.,"""I--worship real belief--of any kind,"" he stammered, for her words and the close proximity of her atmosphere caused a strange upheaval in his heart that he could not account for.",He faltered in his speech.,"""It is the most vital quality in life--rarer than deity.""",He was using her own phrases even.,"""It is creative.","It constructs the world anew--"" ""And may reconstruct the old.""","She said it, lifting her face above him a little, so that her eyes looked down into his own.",It grew big and somehow masculine.,"It was the face of a priest, spiritual power in it.","Where, oh where in the echoing Past had he known this woman's soul?","He saw her in another setting, a forest of columns dim about her, towering above giant aisles.",Again he felt the Desert had come close.,Into this tent-like hall of the hotel came the sifting of tiny sand.,"It heaped softly about the very furniture against his feet, blocking the exits of door and window.",It shrouded the little present.,The wind that brought it stirred a veil that had hung for ages motionless.... She had been saying many things that he had missed while his mind went searching.,"""There were types of life the Atlantean system knew it might revive--life unmanifested to-day in any bodily form,"" was the sentence he caught with his return to the actual present.","""A type of life?""","he whispered, looking about him, as though to see who it was had joined them; ""you mean a--soul?","Some kind of soul, alien to humanity, or to--to any forms of living thing in the world to-day?""","What she had been saying reached him somehow, it seemed, though he had not heard the words themselves.","Still hesitating, he was yet so eager to hear.","Already he felt she meant to include him in her purposes, and that in the end he must go willingly.",So strong was her persuasion on his mind.,And he felt as if he knew vaguely what was coming.,"Before she answered his curious question--prompting it indeed--rose in his mind that strange idea of the Group-Soul: the theory that big souls cannot express themselves in a single individual, but need an entire group for their full manifestation.",He listened intently.,"The reflection that this sudden intimacy was unnatural, he rejected, for many conversations were really gathered into one.",Long watching and preparation on both sides had cleared the way for the ripening of acquaintance into confidence--how long he dimly wondered?,"But if this conception of the Group-Soul was not new, the suggestion Lady Statham developed out of it was both new and startling--and yet always so curiously familiar.","Its value for him lay, not in far-fetched evidence that supported it, but in the deep belief which made it a vital asset in an honest inner life.","""An individual,"" she said quietly, ""one soul expressed completely in a single person, I mean, is exceedingly rare.",Not often is a physical instrument found perfect enough to provide it with adequate expression.,In the lower ranges of humanity--certainly in animal and insect life--one soul is shared by many.,Behind a tribe of savages stands one Savage.,"A flock of birds is a single Bird, scattered through the consciousness of all.","They wheel in mid-air, they migrate, they obey the deep intelligence called instinct--all as one.",The life of any one lion is the life of all--the lion group-soul that manifests itself in the entire genus.,"An ant-heap is a single Ant;

that they, too, had met before.","But this, compared to the grave certainty of the rest, was merest fantasy that did not hold his attention.","He answered, hardly knowing what he said.","His preoccupation with other thoughts deep down was so intense, that he was probably barely polite, uttering empty phrases, with his mind elsewhere.","His one desire was to escape and be alone, and it was with genuine relief that he presently excused himself and went upstairs to bed.","The halls, he noticed, were empty; an Arab servant waited to put the lights out.","He walked up, for the lift had long ceased running.",And the magic of old Egypt stalked beside him.,The studies that had fascinated his mind in earlier youth returned with the power that had subdued his mind in boyhood.,The cult of Osiris woke in his blood again; Horus and Nephthys stirred in their long-forgotten centres.,"There revived in him, too long buried, the awful glamour of those liturgal rites and vast body of observances, those spells and formulae of incantation of the oldest known recension that years ago had captured his imagination and belief--the Book of the Dead.",Trumpet voices called to his heart again across the desert of some dim past.,There were forms of life--impulses from the Creative Power which is the Universe--other than the soul of man.,They could be known.,"A spiritual exaltation, roused by the words and presence of this singular woman, shouted to him as he went.","Then, as he closed his bedroom door, carefully locking it, there stood beside him--Vance.","The forgotten figure of Vance came up close--the watching eyes, the simulated interest, the feigned belief, the detective mental attitude, these broke through the grandiose panorama, bringing darkness.","Vance, strong personality that hid behind assumed nonentity for some purpose of his own, intruded with sudden violence, demanding an explanation of his presence.","And, with an equal suddenness, explanation offered itself then and there.","It came unsought, its horror of certainty utterly unjustified; and it came in this unexpected fashion: Behind the interest and acquiescence of the man ran--fear: but behind the vivid fear ran another thing that Henriot now perceived was vile.","For the first time in his life, Henriot knew it at close quarters, actual, ready to operate.","Though familiar enough in daily life to be of common occurrence, Henriot had never realised it as he did now, so close and terrible.","In the same way he had never _realised_ that he would die--vanish from the busy world of men and women, forgotten as though he had never existed, an eddy of wind-blown dust.",And in the man named Richard Vance this thing was close upon blossom.,Henriot could not name it to himself.,Even in thought it appalled him.,"*       *       *       *       * He undressed hurriedly, almost with the child's idea of finding safety between the sheets.",His mind undressed itself as well.,The business of the day laid itself automatically aside; the will sank down; desire grew inactive.,Henriot was exhausted.,"But, in that stage towards slumber when thinking stops, and only fugitive pictures pass across the mind in shadowy dance, his brain ceased shouting its mechanical explanations, and his soul unveiled a peering eye.","Great limbs of memory, smothered by the activities of the Present, stirred their stiffened lengths through the sands of long ago--sands this woman had begun to excavate from some far-off pre-existence they had surely known together.",Vagueness and certainty ran hand in hand.,"Details were unrecoverable, but the emotions in which they were embedded moved.","He turned restlessly in his bed, striving to seize the amazing clues and follow them.",But deliberate effort hid them instantly again; they retired instantly into the subconsciousness.,With the brain of this body he now occupied they had nothing to do.,The brain stored memories of each life only.,This ancient script was graven in his soul.,Subconsciousness alone could interpret and reveal.,And it was his subconscious memory that Lady Statham had been so busily excavating.,"Dimly it stirred and moved about the depths within him, never clearly seen, indefinite, felt as a yearning after unrecoverable knowledge.","Against the darker background of Vance's fear and sinister purpose--both of this present life, and recent--he saw the grandeur of this woman's impossible dream, and _knew_, beyond argument or reason, that it was true.","Judgment and will asleep, he left the impossibility aside, and took the grandeur.",The Belief of Lady Statham was not credulity and superstition; it was Memory.,"Still to this day, over the sands of Egypt, hovered immense spiritual potencies, so vast that they could only know physical expression in a group--in many.","Their sphere of bodily manifestation must be a host, each individual unit in that host a corpuscle in the whole.","The wind, rising from the Lybian wastes across the Nile, swept up against the exposed side of the hotel, and made his windows rattle--the old, sad winds of Egypt.",Henriot got out of bed to fasten the outside shutters.,He stood a moment and watched the moon floating down behind the Sakkara Pyramids.,The Pleiades and Orion's Belt hung brilliantly;

it moved a little towards him.",He saw the eternal countenance of the Desert watching him--immobile and unchanging behind these shifting veils the winds laid so carefully over it.,"Egypt, the ancient Egypt, turned in her vast sarcophagus of Desert, wakening from her sleep of ages at the Belief of approaching worshippers.",Only in this insignificant manner could he express a letter of the terrific language that crowded to seek expression through his soul....,He closed the shutters and carefully fastened them.,"He turned to go back to bed, curiously trembling.","Then, as he did so, the whole singular delusion caught him with a shock that held him motionless.",Up rose the stupendous apparition of the entire Desert and stood behind him on that balcony.,"Swift as thought, in silence, the Desert stood on end against his very face.","It towered across the sky, hiding Orion and the moon; it dipped below the horizons.",The whole grey sheet of it rose up before his eyes and stood.,Through its unfolding skirts ran ten thousand eddies of swirling sand as the creases of its grave-clothes smoothed themselves out in moonlight.,"And a bleak, scarred countenance, huge as a planet, gazed down into his own....",Through his dreamless sleep that night two things lay active and awake ... in the subconscious part that knows no slumber.,They were incongruous.,"One was evil, small and human; the other unearthly and sublime.","For the memory of the fear that haunted Vance, and the sinister cause of it, pricked at him all night long.","But behind, beyond this common, intelligible emotion, lay the crowding wonder that caught his soul with glory: The Sand was stirring, the Desert was awake.","Ready to mate with them in material form, brooded close the Ka of that colossal Entity that once expressed itself through the myriad life of ancient Egypt.","VI Next day, and for several days following, Henriot kept out of the path of Lady Statham and her nephew.",The acquaintanceship had grown too rapidly to be quite comfortable.,"It was easy to pretend that he took people at their face value, but it was a pose;

but at night he lay often sleepless, calculating chances of escape.","He never did escape, however.","The Desert that watched little Helouan with great, unwinking eyes watched also every turn and twist he made.","Like this oasis, he basked in the sun of older time, and dreamed beneath forgotten moons.",The sand at last had crept into his inmost heart.,It sifted over him.,"Seeking a reaction from normal, everyday things, he made tourist trips; yet, while recognising the comedy in his attitude, he never could lose sight of the grandeur that banked it up so hauntingly.",These two contrary emotions grafted themselves on all he did and saw.,"He crossed the Nile at Bedrashein, and went again to the Tomb-World of Sakkara; but through all the chatter of veiled and helmeted tourists, the _bandar-log_ of our modern Jungle, ran this dark under-stream of awe their monkey methods could not turn aside.","One world lay upon another, but this modern layer was a shallow crust that, like the phenomenon of the ""desert-film,"" a mere angle of falling light could instantly obliterate.","Beneath the sand, deep down, he passed along the Street of Tombs, as he had often passed before, moved then merely by historical curiosity and admiration, but now by emotions for which he found no name.","He saw the enormous sarcophagi of granite in their gloomy chambers where the sacred bulls once lay, swathed and embalmed like human beings, and, in the flickering candle light, the mood of ancient rites surged round him, menacing his doubts and laughter.","The least human whisper in these subterraneans, dug out first four thousand years ago, revived ominous Powers that stalked beside him, forbidding and premonitive.","He gazed at the spots where Mariette, unearthing them forty years ago, found fresh as of yesterday the marks of fingers and naked feet--of those who set the sixty-five ton slabs in position.","And when he came up again into the sunshine he met the eternal questions of the pyramids, overtopping all his mental horizons.","Sand blocked all the avenues of younger emotion, leaving the channels of something in him incalculably older, open and clean swept.","He slipped homewards, uncomfortable and followed, glad to be with a crowd--because he was otherwise alone with more than he could dare to think about.","Keeping just ahead of his companions, he crossed the desert edge where the ghost of Memphis walks under rustling palm trees that screen no stone left upon another of all its mile-long populous splendours.",For here was a vista his imagination could realise; here he could know the comfort of solid ground his feet could touch.,"Gigantic Ramases, lying on his back beneath their shade and staring at the sky, similarly helped to steady his swaying thoughts.",Imagination could deal with these.,"And daily thus he watched the busy world go to and fro to its scale of tips and bargaining, and gladly mingled with it, trying to laugh and study guidebooks, and listen to half-fledged explanations, but always seeing the comedy of his poor attempts.","Not all those little donkeys, bells tinkling, beads shining, trotting beneath their comical burdens to the tune of shouting and belabouring, could stem this tide of deeper things the woman had let loose in the subconscious part of him.","Everywhere he saw the mysterious camels go slouching through the sand, gurgling the water in their skinny, extended throats.",Centuries passed between the enormous knee-stroke of their stride.,"And, every night, the sunsets restored the forbidding, graver mood, with their crimson, golden splendour, their strange green shafts of light, then--sudden twilight that brought the Past upon him with an awful leap.","Upon the stage then stepped the figures of this pair of human beings, chanting their ancient plainsong of incantation in the moonlit desert, and working their rites of unholy evocation as the priests had worked them centuries before in the sands that now buried Sakkara fathoms deep.","Then one morning he woke with a question in his mind, as though it had been asked of him in sleep and he had waked just before the answer came.","""Why do I spend my time sight-seeing, instead of going alone into the Desert as before?","What has made me change?""",This latest mood now asked for explanation.,"And the answer, coming up automatically, startled him.",It was so clear and sure--had been lying in the background all along.,One word contained it: Vance.,"The sinister intentions of this man, forgotten in the rush of other emotions, asserted themselves again convincingly.","The human horror, so easily comprehensible, had been smothered for the time by the hint of unearthly revelations.",But it had operated all the time.,Now it took the lead.,He dreaded to be alone in the Desert with this dark picture in his mind of what Vance meant to bring there to completion.,This abomination of a selfish human will returned to fix its terror in him.,To be alone in the Desert meant to be alone with the imaginative picture of what Vance--he knew it with such strange certainty--hoped to bring about there.,There was absolutely no evidence to justify the grim suspicion.,"It seemed indeed far-fetched enough, this connection between the sand and the purpose of an evil-minded, violent man.",But Henriot saw it true.,He could argue it away in a few minutes--easily.,"Yet the instant thought ceased, it returned, led up by intuition.","It possessed him, filled his mind with horrible possibilities.",He feared the Desert as he might have feared the scene of some atrocious crime.,"And, for the time, this dread of a merely human thing corrected the big seduction of the other--the suggested ""super-natural.""","Side by side with it, his desire to join himself to the purposes of the woman increased steadily.","They kept out of his way apparently;

and twice a thousand years drove at his back.,Everything still basked in the sunshine.,"He passed Al Hayat, the stately hotel that dominates the village like a palace built against the sky; and in its pillared colonnades and terraces he saw the throngs of people having late afternoon tea and listening to the music of a regimental band.","Men in flannels were playing tennis, parties were climbing off donkeys after long excursions; there was laughter, talking, a babel of many voices.",The gaiety called to him; the everyday spirit whispered to stay and join the crowd of lively human beings.,"Soon there would be merry dinner-parties, dancing, voices of pretty women, sweet white dresses, singing, and the rest.",Soft eyes would question and turn dark.,He picked out several girls he knew among the palms.,"But it was all many, oh so many leagues away;

it lay everywhere, unswept and smooth as when the feet of vanished civilizations trod its burning surface, then dipped behind the curtains Time pins against the stars.",And here the body of the tide set all one way.,"There was a greater strength of current, draught and suction.",He felt the powerful undertow.,"Deeper masses drew his feet sideways, and he felt the rushing of the central body of the sand.","The sands were moving, from their foundation upwards.",He went unresistingly with them.,"Turning a moment, he looked back at shining little Helouan in the blaze of evening light.","The voices reached him very faintly, merged now in a general murmur.","Beyond lay the strip of Delta vivid green, the palms, the roofs of Bedrashein, the blue laughter of the Nile with its flocks of curved felucca sails.","Further still, rising above the yellow Libyan horizon, gloomed the vast triangles of a dozen Pyramids, cutting their wedge-shaped clefts out of a sky fast crimsoning through a sea of gold.","Seen thus, their dignity imposed upon the entire landscape.","They towered darkly, symbolic signatures of the ancient Powers that now watched him taking these little steps across their damaged territory.","He gazed a minute, then went on.",He saw the big pale face of the moon in the east.,"Above the ever-silent Thing these giant symbols once interpreted, she rose, grand, effortless, half-terrible as themselves.","And, with her, she lifted up this tide of the Desert that drew his feet across the sand to Wadi Hof.",A moment later he dipped below the ridge that buried Helouan and Nile and Pyramids from sight.,He entered the ancient waters.,"Time then, in an instant, flowed back behind his footsteps, obliterating every trace.",And with it his mind went too.,"He stepped across the gulf of centuries, moving into the Past.",The Desert lay before him--an open tomb wherein his soul should read presently of things long vanished.,The strange half-lights of sunset began to play their witchery then upon the landscape.,A purple glow came down upon the Mokattam Hills.,"Perspective danced its tricks of false, incredible deception.","The soaring kites that were a mile away seemed suddenly close, passing in a moment from the size of gnats to birds with a fabulous stretch of wing.","Ridges and cliffs rushed close without a hint of warning, and level places sank into declivities and basins that made him trip and stumble.","That indescribable quality of the Desert, which makes timid souls avoid the hour of dusk, emerged; it spread everywhere, undisguised.","And the bewilderment it brings is no vain, imagined thing, for it distorts vision utterly, and the effect upon the mind when familiar sight goes floundering is the simplest way in the world of dragging the anchor that grips reality.",At the hour of sunset this bewilderment comes upon a man with a disconcerting swiftness.,It rose now with all this weird rapidity.,Henriot found himself enveloped at a moment's notice.,"But, knowing well its effect, he tried to judge it and pass on.","The other matters, the object of his journey chief of all, he refused to dwell upon with any imagination.","Wisely, his mind, while never losing sight of it, declined to admit the exaggeration that over-elaborate thinking brings.","""I'm going to witness an incredible experiment in which two enthusiastic religious dreamers believe firmly,"" he repeated to himself.","""I have agreed to draw--anything I see.","There may be truth in it, or they may be merely self-suggested vision due to an artificial exaltation of their minds.",I'm interested--perhaps against my better judgment.,"Yet I'll see the adventure out--because I _must_.""",This was the attitude he told himself to take.,"Whether it was the real one, or merely adopted to warm a cooling courage, he could not tell.",The emotions were so complex and warring.,"His mind, automatically, kept repeating this comforting formula.",Deeper than that he could not see to judge.,For a man who knew the full content of his thought at such a time would solve some of the oldest psychological problems in the world.,"Sand had already buried judgment, and with it all attempt to explain the adventure by the standards acceptable to his brain of to-day.","He steered subconsciously through a world of dim, huge, half-remembered wonders.","The sun, with that abrupt Egyptian suddenness, was below the horizon now.",The pyramid field had swallowed it.,"Ra, in his golden boat, sailed distant seas beyond the Libyan wilderness.","Henriot walked on and on, aware of utter loneliness.","He was walking fields of dream, too remote from modern life to recall companionship he once had surely known.","How dim it was, how deep and distant, how lost in this sea of an incalculable Past!",He walked into the places that are soundless.,"The soundlessness of ocean, miles below the surface, was about him.","He was with One only--this unfathomable, silent thing where nothing breathes or stirs--nothing but sunshine, shadow and the wind-borne sand.","Slowly, in front, the moon climbed up the eastern sky, hanging above the silence--silence that ran unbroken across the horizons to where Suez gleamed upon the waters of a sister sea in motion.",That moon was glinting now upon the Arabian Mountains by its desolate shores.,Southwards stretched the wastes of Upper Egypt a thousand miles to meet the Nubian wilderness.,But over all these separate Deserts stirred the soft whisper of the moving sand--deep murmuring message that Life was on the way to unwind Death.,"The Ka of Egypt, swathed in centuries of sand, hovered beneath the moon towards her ancient tenement.",For the transformation of the Desert now began in earnest.,It grew apace.,"Before he had gone the first two miles of his hour's journey, the twilight caught the rocky hills and twisted them into those monstrous revelations of physiognomies they barely take the trouble to conceal even in the daytime.","And, while he well understood the eroding agencies that have produced them, there yet rose in his mind a deeper interpretation lurking just behind their literal meanings.","Here, through the motionless surfaces, that nameless thing the Desert ill conceals urged outwards into embryonic form and shape, akin, he almost felt, to those immense deific symbols of Other Life the Egyptians knew and worshipped.","Hence, from the Desert, had first come, he felt, the unearthly life they typified in their monstrous figures of granite, evoked in their stately temples, and communed with in the ritual of their Mystery ceremonials.","This ""watching"" aspect of the Libyan Desert is really natural enough; but it is just the natural, Henriot knew, that brings the deepest revelations.","The surface limestones, resisting the erosion, block themselves ominously against the sky, while the softer sand beneath sets them on altared pedestals that define their isolation splendidly.","Blunt and unconquerable, these masses now watched him pass between them.","The Desert surface formed them, gave them birth.","They rose, they saw, they sank down again--waves upon a sea that carried forgotten life up from the depths below.","Of forbidding, even menacing type, they somewhere mated with genuine grandeur.","Unformed, according to any standard of human or of animal faces, they achieved an air of giant physiognomy which made them terrible.","The unwinking stare of eyes--lidless eyes that yet ever succeed in hiding--looked out under well-marked, level eyebrows, suggesting a vision that included the motives and purposes of his very heart.","They looked up grandly, understood why he was there, and then--slowly withdrew their mysterious, penetrating gaze.","The strata built them so marvellously up; the heavy, threatening brows; thick lips, curved by the ages into a semblance of cold smiles; jowls drooping into sandy heaps that climbed against the cheeks; protruding jaws, and the suggestion of shoulders just about to lift the entire bodies out of the sandy beds--this host of countenances conveyed a solemnity of expression that seemed everlasting, implacable as Death.","Of human signature they bore no trace, nor was comparison possible between their kind and any animal life.",They peopled the Desert here.,"And their smiles, concealed yet just discernible, went broadening with the darkness into a Desert laughter.",The silence bore it underground.,But Henriot was aware of it.,"The troop of faces slipped into that single, enormous countenance which is the visage of the Sand.","And he saw it everywhere, yet nowhere.",Thus with the darkness grew his imaginative interpretation of the Desert.,"Yet there was construction in it, a construction, moreover, that was _not_ entirely his own.","Powers, he felt, were rising, stirring, wakening from sleep.","Behind the natural faces that he saw, these other things peered gravely at him as he passed.","They used, as it were, materials that lay ready to their hand.","Imagination furnished these hints of outline, yet the Powers themselves were real.",There _was_ this amazing movement of the sand.,"By no other manner could his mind have conceived of such a thing, nor dreamed of this simple, yet dreadful method of approach.",Approach!,that was the word that first stood out and startled him.,There was approach; something was drawing nearer.,The Desert rose and walked beside him.,"For not alone these ribs of gleaming limestone contributed towards the elemental visages, but the entire hills, of which they were an outcrop, ran to assist in the formation, and were a necessary part of them.","He was watched and stared at from behind, in front, on either side, and even from below.","The sand that swept him on, kept even pace with him.","It turned luminous too, with a patchwork of glimmering effect that was indescribably weird; lanterns glowed within its substance, and by their light he stumbled on, glad of the Arab boy he would presently meet at the appointed place.","The last torch of the sunset had flickered out, melting into the wilderness, when, suddenly opening at his feet, gaped the deep, wide gully known as Wadi Hof.",Its curve swept past him.,This first impression came upon him with a certain violence: that the desolate valley rushed.,"He saw but a section of its curve and sweep, but through its entire length of several miles the Wadi fled away.","The moon whitened it like snow, piling black shadows very close against the cliffs.",In the flood of moonlight it went rushing past.,It was emptying itself.,"For a moment the stream of movement seemed to pause and look up into his face, then instantly went on again upon its swift career.",It was like the procession of a river to the sea.,The valley emptied itself to make way for what was coming.,"The approach, moreover, had already begun.","Conscious that he was trembling, he stood and gazed into the depths, seeking to steady his mind by the repetition of the little formula he had used before.",He said it half aloud.,"But, while he did so, his heart whispered quite other things.",Thoughts the woman and the man had sown rose up in a flock and fell upon him like a storm of sand.,Their impetus drove off all support of ordinary ideas.,"They shook him where he stood, staring down into this river of strange invisible movement that was hundreds of feet in depth and a quarter of a mile across.","He sought to realise himself as he actually was to-day--mere visitor to Helouan, tempted into this wild adventure with two strangers.",But in vain.,"That seemed a dream, unreal, a transient detail picked out from the enormous Past that now engulfed him, heart and mind and soul.",_This_ was the reality.,The shapes and faces that the hills of sand built round him were the play of excited fancy only.,By sheer force he pinned his thought against this fact: but further he could not get.,"There _were_ Powers at work; they were being stirred, wakened somewhere into activity.",Evocation had already begun.,That sense of their approach as he had walked along from Helouan was not imaginary.,"A descent of some type of life, vanished from the world too long for recollection, was on the way,--so vast that it would manifest itself in a group of forms, a troop, a host, an army.","These two were near him somewhere at this very moment, already long at work, their minds driving beyond this little world.",The valley was emptying itself--for the descent of life their ritual invited.,And the movement in the sand was likewise true.,He recalled the sentences the woman had used.,"""My body,"" he reflected, ""like the bodies life makes use of everywhere, is mere upright heap of earth and dust and--sand.","Here in the Desert is the raw material, the greatest store of it in the world.""",And on the heels of it came sharply that other thing: that this descending Life would press into its service all loose matter within its reach--to form that sphere of action which would be in a literal sense its Body.,"In the first few seconds, as he stood there, he realised all this, and realised it with an overwhelming conviction it was futile to deny.",The fast-emptying valley would later brim with an unaccustomed and terrific life.,"Yet Death hid there too--a little, ugly, insignificant death.","With the name of Vance it flashed upon his mind and vanished, too tiny to be thought about in this torrent of grander messages that shook the depths within his soul.","He bowed his head a moment, hardly knowing what he did.",He could have waited thus a thousand years it seemed.,"He was conscious of a wild desire to run away, to hide, to efface himself utterly, his terror, his curiosity, his little wonder, and not be seen of anything.",But it was all vain and foolish.,The Desert saw him.,The Gigantic knew that he was there.,No escape was possible any longer.,"Caught by the sand, he stood amid eternal things.",The river of movement swept him too.,"These hills, now motionless as statues, would presently glide forward into the cavalcade, sway like vessels, and go past with the procession.","At present only the contents, not the frame, of the Wadi moved.",An immense soft brush of moonlight swept it empty for what was on the way....,But presently the entire Desert would stand up and also go.,"Then, making a sideways movement, his feet kicked against something soft and yielding that lay heaped upon the Desert floor, and Henriot discovered the rugs the Arab boy had carefully set down before he made full speed for the friendly lights of Helouan.",The sound of his departing footsteps had long since died away.,He was alone.,"The detail restored to him his consciousness of the immediate present, and, stooping, he gathered up the rugs and overcoat and began to make preparations for the night.","But the appointed spot, whence he was to watch, lay upon the summit of the opposite cliffs.",He must cross the Wadi bed and climb.,"Slowly and with labour he made his way down a steep cleft into the depth of the Wadi Hof, sliding and stumbling often, till at length he stood upon the floor of shining moonlight.",It was very smooth; windless utterly; still as space; each particle of sand lay in its ancient place asleep.,"The movement, it seemed, had ceased.","He clambered next up the eastern side, through pitch-black shadows, and within the hour reached the ledge upon the top whence he could see below him, like a silvered map, the sweep of the valley bed.","The wind nipped keenly here again, coming over the leagues of cooling sand.","Loose boulders of splintered rock, started by his climbing, crashed and boomed into the depths.","He banked the rugs behind him, wrapped himself in his overcoat, and lay down to wait.",Behind him was a two-foot crumbling wall against which he leaned; in front a drop of several hundred feet through space.,"He lay upon a platform, therefore, invisible from the Desert at his back.","Below, the curving Wadi formed a natural amphitheatre in which each separate boulder fallen from the cliffs, and even the little _silla_ shrubs the camels eat, were plainly visible.",He noted all the bigger ones among them.,He counted them over half aloud.
