the Queen     Cells.,"The great production of drones can be regulated by limiting     the amount of drone cell in any hive, and altogether prevented by     removing it all from a stock hive, about the purity of whose strain     there is the least doubt; whilst again, it may be encouraged in a     pure blooded stock hive, by inserting at the proper time an     additional bar containing drone comb.","Any man handy with tools may     make them for himself at the cost of the materials, and they will     last a lifetime.","I can supply my friends with as many as they     require at half a guinea, for which they pay double or treble in     the shops; whilst those who think nothing can be good except it is     high-priced, and do not like the trouble of making their own hives,     may go to any cost they like.","The preceding woodcut represents a     hive on this principle, but with certain modifications, which may     be obtained of Mr. Neighbour, 149, Regent-street, and will suit

cakes may be kept without     deterioration through the winter, by wrapping them up separately in     clean writing paper, and then packing them away in a tin, each cake     being placed as it stood

Alcazar, the old     Palace of the Moors, is a large orange garden, and in the midst of     it a square tank, of Moorish work, used for irrigation.","The garden     was tenanted by a widow woman who owned a dozen or so magnificent     stall-fed milch cows, and thither I resorted early every morning,     after visiting the Cathedral, for the sake of a glass of new milk,     and a lesson in Spanish from her two little daughters aged     respectively nine and ten, Incarnacion (the last c pronounced th)     and Salud.","Commend me to two chattering little girls, when their     shyness has once worn off, as the best teachers of a new language.","One glorious morning I was sitting on the edge of the aforesaid     tank, inhaling the delicious perfume of the orange blossoms, when a     Frog struck up his ""Brekekekex, Coax Coax"" from the still water,     and at the same time the air was resonant with the sweet song of     the Nightingale.","I pride myself on knowing somewhat of the     languages of Birds, Beasts, and (Fishes?",No!,"they are mutum pecus,     but let us say) Bull Frogs so I listened attentively, and found the     Nightingale and Bull Frog, were each of them serenading his own     wife, arboreal, and aquatic.",Each wife thought her husband the very     best singer in the world: that not a note of his song could be     altered for the better; and both Nightingale and Bull Frog thought     the other singer a bore.,I noted down the whole of this musical     contest at the time.,It is quite in the way of one of Virgil's     Amoeboean Bucolics.,"Not Corydon and Thyrsis, but Batrachos and     Philomela were contending for the prize.","It is too long to insert     here, but may be had of my publishers, under the title of ""Bull     Frog and Nightingale;"" an Apologue, price 6d.","But the sum of the     whole matter is this: I do not believe, ""pace Darwinii nostri     dicatur,"" that natural selection, and conjugal preference has had     the effect of altering or improving the Nightingale's song in the     last two thousand years.","It could not be louder or better, and I     trust may last my time unchanged, whilst on the evidence of     Aristophanes' chorus we know that Bull Frogs, then, as now, sang     ""Brekekekex, Coax, Coax,"" _and that song only_.","THE HONEY POT.--_Page 47-52._--This Fytte, comical as it is in     itself, is particularly valuable as instructing the untravelled     Britisher in the peculiarities of a German bedstead; far too short     for all who have not by some Procrustoean process been reduced to     the normal height of five feet, no inches!","the upper sheet sown to     the coverlid, with no possibility of tucking it in, and liable to     fall off the sleeper altogether.","No blankets, but a mountain of     feather-bed piled above, which either stifles you in summer, or     rolling off, leaves you to freeze in the winter.",Yet in such a bed     as this what wonderful positions Mr. Dull managed to assume under     the influence of fear.,"Imitate him, my gentle reader, if you are     still young and active, and then you will appreciate his     contortions.","""A HONEY THIEF, ILL MAY HE THRIVE.""",--_Page 55._--Every Bee keeper     will echo this wish.,I know no sight more piteous than an apiary     the night after it has been plundered.,"Light Hives upset, and     lying, with the combs all broken, on the ground.","The Bees crawling     about in wild confusion around their violated homes, lately so     neat, and now the very picture of desolation.","In vain they attempt     to repair the damage which the spoiler's hand has created; whilst     the stands where the heavy stocks stood the evening before, are one     and all tenantless.",Many devices to protect Hives from robbers have     been tried.,"Wooden boxes are tightly screwed to the bottom board     from below, whilst the bottom board itself is strongly bolted to     the stand.",This will indeed protect a hive from anything but a     powerful crow bar.,"But the remedy is worse than the disease, as it     prevents your ever changing or cleaning the bottom board, and is,     in many ways, inconvenient.","The best preservative I can think of is     to have a savage dog, savage to all but his master, with a strong     chain, not fastened to his kennel, but ending in an iron ring,     which can slide along a small pole placed horizontally about a foot     from the ground in front of the Hives.","I have seen this mode of     defence adopted in Germany for the protection of the valuable Leech     ponds, which are there fattened for the market.","It answers for the     defence of Leeches, and if so, why not for Bees.","""MANY A NOSE, UPTURNED, WAS SNORING IN REPOSE.""","--_Page 66._--My     readers will doubtless remember, as I confess to have done when     penning the above line, the opening of Southey's Thalaba, and the     inimitable parody thereof in the Rejected Addresses.","When a thing     has been done excellently well, it is folly to again attempt the     same with a certainty of failure before our eyes.","We verse makers     do not steal from each other; we are all one brotherhood, and     _Corbies nae pike out corbies e'en_.","But we convey--_conveys_ the     word, says glorious Will.","""AND BETWEEN THEM BORE,   ""THE FELON TO THE PRISON DOOR.""","--_Page 66._     This mode of removing a captive would have suited that extinct     species of our protective force, that of the Dogberry and Verges     order, and may be recommended to our new police as more merciful,     and less grating to the feelings of a prisoner than the present     mode of ""running a man in;"" especially as they generally get hold     of the wrong person.","A police sedan would enable the innocent     captive to conceal his features from the tail of little boys and     idle quidnuncs, specially if he were carried like our honey thief     head downwards.","The last Chapter is like the first, written in the style of the     Butterfly's Ball and the Grasshopper's feast, and is, it seems to     me, no less admirable.","If I pride myself on anything in this     translation it is on the concluding lines:         ""The evening star went flicker--flick--         Over the bedroom candlestick;         And round its silver radiance shed         To light the sleepy moon to bed.""","""I'VE DONE I DOFF MY RIDING GEAR,   ""AND ORDER PEGASUS--HIS BEER.""",--_Page 72._     Baierische Bier is infinitely superior to any Hippocrene.,"But no     drink in the world can hold a candle to genuine ""Wienische Bier,""     as it comes cool drawn from the cellar.","The Romans knew not beer,     and so had to put up with ""Falernian,"" or even the ""vile     Coecubum.""","I say put up, for the wine that now goes by the name     of Falernian is detestable.","I suppose, however, that two thousand     years ago it was far more carefully made, as I trust it may again     be in ""Italia Unita.""","The Romans, knew not beer, but the Greeks had     tasted it, though brewed by the hands of barbarians.",In Xenophon's     Retreat of the Ten Thousand we are told that they came upon a race     of people from whom they got         [Greek: Hek krithon methu.],"Let us then leave Pegasus to enjoy his drink of barley wine, though     like Baron Munchausen's famous steed, he hath not the wherewithal     to stow away his beer.","My dear old Peggy, alluded to in the first     of this series of notes, and therefore the fittest subject for a     wind up, was, when hard worked, very fond of a quart of good ale,     with half a quartern loaf broken into it; she would drink up the     ale at a draught, then quickly munch the sop, and start with fresh     vigour for another ten-mile trot.",CORRIGENDA.,"The reader is asked to excuse the following errors, excusable--as for the sake of having its original wood blocks, the work, with the exception of the notes, was printed abroad.","Page 6, for _'ts_ read _t'is_.","Page 35 should be--         ""But every sweet-toothed school-boy knows,         He can't eat honey with his toes.""","Page 36, for _hinder's_ read

and both Nightingale and Bull Frog thought     the other singer a bore.,I noted down the whole of this musical     contest at the time.,It is quite in the way of one of Virgil's     Amoeboean Bucolics.,"Not Corydon and Thyrsis, but Batrachos and     Philomela were contending for the prize.","It is too long to insert     here, but may be had of my publishers, under the title of ""Bull     Frog and Nightingale;"" an Apologue, price 6d.","But the sum of the     whole matter is this: I do not believe, ""pace Darwinii nostri     dicatur,"" that natural selection, and conjugal preference has had     the effect of altering or improving the Nightingale's song in the     last two thousand years.","It could not be louder or better, and I     trust may last my time unchanged, whilst on the evidence of     Aristophanes' chorus we know that Bull Frogs, then, as now, sang     ""Brekekekex, Coax, Coax,"" _and that song only_.","THE HONEY POT.--_Page 47-52._--This Fytte, comical as it is in     itself, is particularly valuable as instructing the untravelled     Britisher in the peculiarities of a German bedstead;

whilst     the stands where the heavy stocks stood the evening before, are one     and all tenantless.",Many devices to protect Hives from robbers have     been tried.,"Wooden boxes are tightly screwed to the bottom board     from below, whilst the bottom board itself is strongly bolted to     the stand.",This will indeed protect a hive from anything but a     powerful crow bar.,"But the remedy is worse than the disease, as it     prevents your ever changing or cleaning the bottom board, and is,     in many ways, inconvenient.","The best preservative I can think of is     to have a savage dog, savage to all but his master, with a strong     chain, not fastened to his kennel, but ending in an iron ring,     which can slide along a small pole placed horizontally about a foot     from the ground in front of the Hives.","I have seen this mode of     defence adopted in Germany for the protection of the valuable Leech     ponds, which are there fattened for the market.","It answers for the     defence of Leeches, and if so, why not for Bees.","""MANY A NOSE, UPTURNED, WAS SNORING IN REPOSE.""","--_Page 66._--My     readers will doubtless remember, as I confess to have done when     penning the above line, the opening of Southey's Thalaba, and the     inimitable parody thereof in the Rejected Addresses.","When a thing     has been done excellently well, it is folly to again attempt the     same with a certainty of failure before our eyes.","We verse makers     do not steal from each other;
