"God did not play in convincing of me, the devil did not play in tempting of me, neither did I play when I sunk as into a bottomless pit, when the pangs of hell caught hold upon me; wherefore I may not play in my relating of them, but be plain and simple, and lay down the thing as it was.","He that liketh it, let him receive it; and he that does not, let him produce a better.",Farewell.,"My dear children, the milk and honey is beyond this wilderness.","God be merciful to you, and grant 'that' you be not slothful to go in to possess the land.",JOHN BUNYAN.,"GRACE ABOUNDING TO THE CHIEF OF SINNERS; OR, A BRIEF RELATION OF THE EXCEEDING MERCY OF GOD IN CHRIST, TO HIS POOR SERVANT, JOHN BUNYAN.",[BUNYAN'S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF PREVIOUS TO HIS CONVERSION.],1.,"In this my relation of the merciful working of God upon my soul, it will not be amiss, if, in the first place, I do, in a few words, give you a hint of my pedigree, and manner of bringing up; that thereby the goodness and bounty of God towards me, may be the more advanced and magnified before the sons of men.",2.,"For my descent then, it was, as is well known by many, of a low and inconsiderable generation; my father's house being of that rank that is meanest and most despised of all the families in the land.","[6] Wherefore I have not here, as others, to boast of noble blood, or of a high-born state, according to the flesh; though, all things considered, I magnify the heavenly Majesty, for that by this door he brought me into this world, to partake of the grace and life that is in Christ by the gospel.",3.,"But yet, notwithstanding the meanness and inconsiderableness of my parents, it pleased God to put it into their hearts to put me to school, to learn both to read and write; the which I also attained, according to the rate of other poor men's children;[7] though, to my shame I confess, I did soon lose that little I learned, and that even almost utterly, and that long before the Lord did work his gracious work of conversion upon my soul.",4.,"As for my own natural life, for the time that I was without God in the world, it was indeed according to the course of this world, and ""the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience"" (Eph 2:2,3).","It was my delight to be ""taken captive by the devil at his will"" (2 Tim 2:26).","Being filled with all unrighteousness: the which did also so strongly work and put forth itself, both in my heart and life, and that from a child, that I had but few equals, especially considering my years, which were tender, being few, both for cursing, swearing, lying, and blaspheming the holy name of God.",5.,"Yea, so settled and rooted was I in these things, that they became as a second nature to me; the which, as I also have with soberness considered since, did so offend the Lord, that even in my childhood he did scare and affright me with fearful dreams, and did terrify me with dreadful visions; for often, after I had spent this and the other day in sin, I have in my bed been greatly afflicted, while asleep, with the apprehensions of devils and wicked spirits, who still, as I then thought, laboured to draw me away with them, of which I could never be rid.",6.,"Also I should, at these years, be greatly afflicted and troubled with the thoughts of the day of judgment, and that both night and day, and should tremble at the thoughts of the fearful torments of hell fire; still fearing that it would be my lot to be found at last amongst those devils and hellish fiends, who are there bound down with the chains and bonds of eternal darkness, ""unto the judgment of the great day.""",7.,"These things, I say, when I was but a child, 'but nine or ten years old,' did so distress my soul, that when in the midst of my many sports and childish vanities, amidst my vain companions, I was often much cast down and afflicted in my mind therewith, yet could I not let go my sins.","Yea, I was 'also then' so overcome with despair of life and heaven, that I should often wish either that there had been no hell, or that I had been a devil--supposing they were only tormentors; that if it must needs be that I went thither, I might be rather a tormentor, than 'be' tormented myself.",8.,"A while after, these terrible dreams did leave me, which also I soon forgot; for my pleasures did quickly cut off the remembrance of them, as if they had never been: wherefore, with more greediness, according to the strength of nature, I did still let loose the reins to my lusts, and delighted in all transgression against the law of God: so that, until I came to the state of marriage, I was the very ringleader of all the youth that kept me company, into all manner of vice and ungodliness.",[8] 9.,"Yea, such prevalency had the lusts and fruits of the flesh in this poor soul of mine, that had not a miracle of precious grace prevented, I had not only perished by the stroke of eternal justice, but had also laid myself open, even to the stroke of those laws, which bring some to disgrace and open shame before the face of the world.",10.,"In these days, the thoughts of religion were very grievous to me; I could neither endure it myself, nor that any other should; so that, when I have seen some read in those books that concerned Christian piety, it would be as it were a prison to me.","Then I said unto God, ""Depart from me, for I desire not the knowledge of thy ways"" (Job 21:14).","I was now void of all good consideration, heaven and hell were both out of sight and mind; and as for saving and damning, they were least in my thoughts.","[9] O Lord, thou knowest my life, and my ways were not hid from thee.",11.,"Yet this I well remember, that though I could myself sin with the greatest delight and ease, and also take pleasure in the vileness of my companions; yet, even then, if I have at any time seen wicked things, by those who professed goodness, it would make my spirit tremble.","As once, above all the rest, when I was in my height of vanity, yet hearing one to swear that was reckoned for a religious man, it had so great a stroke upon my spirit, that it made my heart to ache.",12.,"'But God did not utterly leave me, but followed me still, not now with convictions, but judgments; yet such as were mixed with mercy.","For once I fell into a creek of the sea, and hardly escaped drowning.","Another time I fell out of a boat into Bedford river, but mercy yet preserved me alive.","Besides, another time, being in the field with one of my companions, it chanced that an adder passed over the highway; so I, having a stick in my hand, struck her over the back; and having stunned her, I forced open her mouth with my stick, and plucked her sting out with my fingers; by which act, had not God been merciful unto me, I might, by my desperateness, have brought myself to mine end.'",13.,"'This also have I taken notice of with thanksgiving; when I was a soldier, I, with others, were drawn out to go to such a place to besiege it; but when I was just ready to go, one of the company desired to go in my room; to which, when I had consented, he took my place; and coming to the siege, as he stood sentinel, he was shot into the head with a musket bullet, and died.",'[10] 14.,"'Here, as I said, were judgments and mercy, but neither of them did awaken my soul to righteousness; wherefore I sinned still, and grew more and more rebellious against God, and careless of mine own salvation.'",15.,"Presently after this, I changed my condition into a married state, and my mercy was to light upon a wife whose father was counted godly.","[11] This woman and I, though we came together as poor as poor might be, not having so much household stuff as a dish or spoon betwixt us both, yet this she had for her part, The Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven, and The Practice of Piety, which her father had left her when he died.","In these two books I should sometimes read with her, wherein I also found some things that were somewhat pleasing to me; but all this while I met with no conviction.","She also would be often telling of me, what a godly man her father was, and how he would reprove and correct vice, both in his house, and amongst his neighbours; what a strict and holy life he lived in his day, both in word and deed.",16.,"Wherefore these books with this relation, though they did not reach my heart, to awaken it about my sad and sinful state, yet they did beget within me some desires to religion: so that, because I knew no better, I fell in very eagerly with the religion of the times; to wit, to go to church twice a day, and that too with the foremost; and there should very devoutly, both say and sing as others did, yet retaining my wicked life; but withal, I was so overrun with a spirit of superstition, that I adored, and that with great devotion, even all things, both the high place, priest, clerk, vestment, service, and what else belonging to the church; counting all things holy that were therein contained, and especially the priest and clerk most happy, and without doubt, greatly blessed, because they were the servants, as I then thought, of God, and were principal in the holy temple, to do his work therein.",17.,"This conceit grew so strong in little time upon my spirit, that had I but seen a priest, though never so sordid and debauched in his life, I should find my spirit fall under him, reverence him, and knit unto him; yea, I thought for the love I did bear unto them, supposing they were the ministers of God, I could have lain down at their feet, and have been trampled upon by them; their name, their garb, and work, did so intoxicate and bewitch me.",18.,"After I had been thus for some considerable time, another thought came into my mind; and that was, whether we were of the Israelites, or no?","For finding in the Scriptures that they were once the peculiar people of God, thought I, if I were one of this race, my soul must needs be happy.","[12] Now again, I found within me a great longing to be resolved about this question, but could not tell how I should.","At last I asked my father of it; who told me--No, we were not.","Wherefore then I fell in my spirit as to the hopes of that, and so remained.",19.,"But all this while, I was not sensible of the danger and evil of sin; I was kept from considering that sin would damn me, what religion soever I followed, unless I was found in Christ.","Nay, I never thought of him, nor whether there was one, or no.","Thus man, while blind, doth wander, but wearieth himself with vanity, for he knoweth not the way to the city of God (Eccl 10:15).",20.,"But one day, amongst all the sermons our parson made, his subject was, to treat of the Sabbath-day, and of the evil of breaking that, either with labour, sports, or otherwise.","Now I was, notwithstanding my religion, one that took much delight in all manner of vice, and especially that was the day that I did solace myself therewith,[13] wherefore I fell in my conscience under his sermon, thinking and believing that he made that sermon on purpose to show me my evil doing; and at that time I felt what guilt was, though never before, that I can remember; but then I was, for the present, greatly loaden therewith, and so went home when the sermon was ended, with a great burden upon my spirit.",21.,"This, for that instant, did 'benumb'[14] the sinews of my 'best' delights, and did imbitter my former pleasures to me; but behold, it lasted not, for before I had well dined, the trouble began to go off my mind, and my heart returned to its old course: but oh!","How glad was I, that this trouble was gone from me, and that the fire was put out, 'that I might sin again without control!'","Wherefore, when I had satisfied nature with my food, I shook the sermon out of my mind, and to my old custom of sports and gaming I returned with great delight.",22.,"But the same day, as I was in the midst of a game at cat,[15] and having struck it one blow from the hole, just as I was about to strike it the second time, a voice did suddenly dart from heaven into my soul, which said, Wilt thou leave thy sins and go to heaven, or have thy sins and go to hell?","At this I was put to an exceeding maze; wherefore, leaving my cat upon the ground, I looked up to heaven, and was, as if I had, with the eyes of my understanding, seen the Lord Jesus looking down upon me, as being very hotly displeased with me, and as if he did severely threaten me with some grievous punishment for these and other my ungodly practices.",23.,"I had no sooner thus conceived in my mind, but suddenly this conclusion was fastened on my spirit, for the former hint did set my sins again before my face, that I had been a great and grievous sinner, and that it was now too too late for me to look after heaven; for Christ would not forgive me, nor pardon my transgressions.","Then I fell to musing upon this also; and while I was thinking on it, and fearing lest it should be so, I felt my heart sink in despair, concluding it was too late; and therefore I resolved in my mind I would go on in sin: for, thought I, if the case be thus, my state is surely miserable; miserable if I leave my sins, and but miserable if I follow them; I can but be damned, and if I must be so, I had as good be damned for many sins, as to be damned for few.",24.,"Thus I stood in the midst of my play, before all that then were present; but yet I told them nothing: but I say, I having made this conclusion, I returned 'desperately' to my sport again; and I well remember, that presently this kind of despair did so possess my soul, that I was persuaded, I could never attain to other comfort than what I should get in sin; for heaven was gone already, so that on that I must not think; wherefore I found within me a great desire to take my fill of sin, still studying what sin was yet to be committed, that I might taste the sweetness of it; and I made as much haste as I could to fill my belly with its delicates, lest I should die before I had my desire; for that I feared greatly.","In these things, I protest before God, I lie not, neither do I feign this sort of speech; these were really, strongly, and with all my heart, my desires; the good Lord, whose mercy is unsearchable, forgive me my transgressions.",25.,"And I am very confident, that this temptation of the devil is more usual amongst poor creatures than many are aware of, even to overrun their spirits with a scurvy and seared frame of heart, and benumbing of conscience; which frame, he stilly and slyly supplieth with such despair, that though not much guilt attendeth the soul, yet they continually have a secret conclusion within them, that there is no hopes for them; for they have loved sins, ""therefore after them they will go"" (Jer 2:25, 18:12).",26.,"Now therefore I went on in sin with great greediness of mind, still grudging that I could not be so satisfied with it as I would.","This did continue with me about a month, or more; but one day, as I was standing at a neighbour's shop-window, and there cursing and swearing, and playing the madman, after my wonted manner, there sat within, the woman of the house, and heard me, who, though she was a very loose and ungodly wretch, yet protested that I swore and cursed at that most fearful rate, that she was made to tremble to hear me; and told me further, That I was the ungodliest fellow for swearing that ever she heard in all her life; and that I, by thus doing, was able to spoil all the youth in a whole town, if they came but in my company.",27.,"At this reproof I was silenced, and put to secret shame, and that too, as I thought, before the God of heaven; wherefore, while I stood there, and hanging down my head, I wished with all my heart that I might be a little child again, that my father might learn me to speak without this wicked way of swearing;[16] for, thought I, I am so accustomed to it, that it is in vain for me to think of a reformation, for I thought it could never be.",28.,"But how it came to pass, I know not; I did from this time forward so leave my swearing, that it was a great wonder to myself to observe it; and whereas before, I knew not how to speak unless I put an oath before, and another behind, to make my words have authority; now, I could, 'without it,' speak better, and with more pleasantness, than ever I could before.","All this while I knew not Jesus Christ, neither did I leave my sports and plays.",29.,"But quickly after this, I fell in company with one poor man that made profession of religion; who, as I then thought, did talk pleasantly of the Scriptures, and of the matters of religion; wherefore, falling into some love and liking to what he said, I betook me to my Bible, and began to take great pleasure in reading, but especially with the historical part thereof; for, as for Paul's epistles, and Scriptures of that nature, I could not away with them, being as yet but ignorant, either of the corruptions of my nature, or of the want and worth of Jesus Christ to save me.",30.,"Wherefore I fell to some outward reformation, both in my words and life, and did set the commandments before me for my way to heaven; which commandments I also did strive to keep, and, as I thought, did keep them pretty well sometimes, and then I should have comfort; yet now and then should break one, and so afflict my conscience; but then I should repent, and say I was sorry for it, and promise God to do better next time, and there get help again, 'for then I thought I pleased God as well as any man in England.'",31.,"Thus I continued about a year; all which time our neighbours did take me to be a very godly man, a new and religious man, and did marvel much to see such a great and famous alteration in my life and manners; and, indeed, so it was, though yet I knew not Christ, nor grace, nor faith, nor hope; and, truly, as I have well seen since, had then died, my state had been most fearful; well, this, I say, continued about a twelvemonth or more.",32.,"'But, I say, my neighbours were amazed at this my great conversion, from prodigious profaneness, to something like a moral life; and, truly, so they well might; for this my conversion was as great, as for Tom of Bedlam to become a sober man.","[17] Now, therefore, they began to praise, to commend, and to speak well of me, both to my face, and behind my back.","Now, I was, as they said, become godly; now, I was become a right honest man.","But, oh!","When I understood that these were their words and opinions of men, it pleased me mighty well.","For though, as yet, I was nothing but a poor painted hypocrite, yet I loved to be talked of as one that was truly godly.","I was proud of my godliness, and, indeed, I did all I did, either to be seen of, or to be well spoken of, by man.",And thus I continued for about a twelvemonth or more.',33.,"'Now, you must know, that before this I had taken much delight in ringing, but my conscience beginning to be tender, I thought such practice was but vain, and therefore forced myself to leave it, yet my mind hankered; wherefore I should go to the steeple house, and look on it, though I durst not ring.","But I thought this did not become religion neither, yet I forced myself, and would look on still; but quickly after, I began to think, How, if one of the bells should fall?","Then I chose to stand under a main beam, that lay overthwart the steeple, from side to side, thinking there I might stand sure, but then I should think again, should the bell fall with a swing, it might first hit the wall, and then rebounding upon me, might kill me for all this beam.","This made me stand in the steeple door; and now, thought I, I am safe enough; for, if a bell should then fall, I can slip out behind these thick walls, and so be preserved notwithstanding.'",34.,"'So, after this, I would yet go to see them ring, but would not go further than the steeple door; but then it came into my head, How, if the steeple itself should fall?","And this thought, it may fall for ought I know, when I stood and looked on, did continually so shake my mind, that I durst not stand at the steeple door any longer, but was forced to flee, for fear the steeple should fall upon my head.'",35.,"'Another thing was my dancing; I was a full year before I could quite leave that; but all this while, when I thought I kept this or that commandment, or did, by word or deed, anything that I thought was good, I had great peace in my conscience; and should think with myself, God cannot choose but be now pleased with me; yea, to relate it in mine own way, I thought no man in England could please God better than I.'",36.,"'But poor wretch as I was, I was all this while ignorant of Jesus Christ, and going about to establish my own righteousness; and had perished therein, had not God, in mercy, showed me more of my state of nature.'","[HIS CONVERSION AND PAINFUL EXERCISES OF MIND, PREVIOUS TO HIS JOINING THE CHURCH AT BEDFORD.]",37.,"But upon a day, the good providence of God did cast me to Bedford, to work on my calling; and in one of the streets of that town, I came where there were three or four poor women sitting at a door in the sun, and talking about the things of God; and being now willing to hear them discourse, I drew near to hear what they said, for I was now a brisk talker also myself in the matters of religion, but now I may say, I heard, but I understood not; for they were far above, out of my reach; for their talk was about a new birth, the work of God on their hearts, also how they were convinced of their miserable state by nature; they talked how God had visited their souls with his love in the Lord Jesus, and with what words and promises they had been refreshed, comforted, and supported against the temptations of the devil.","Moreover, they reasoned of the suggestions and temptations of Satan in particular; and told to each other by which they had been afflicted, and how they were borne up under his assaults.","They also discoursed of their own wretchedness of heart, of their unbelief; and did contemn, slight, and abhor their own righteousness, as filthy and insufficient to do them any good.",38.,"And methought they spake as if joy did make them speak; they spake with such pleasantness of Scripture language, and with such appearance of grace in all they said, that they were to me, as if they had found a new world,[18] as if they were people that dwelt alone, and were not to be reckoned among their neighbours (Num 23:9).",39.,"At this I felt my own heart began to shake, as mistrusting my condition to be nought; for I saw that in all my thoughts about religion and salvation, the new birth did never enter into my mind, neither knew I the comfort of the Word and promise, nor the deceitfulness and treachery of my own wicked heart.","As for secret thoughts, I took no notice of them; neither did I understand what Satan's temptations were, nor how they were to be withstood and resisted, &c. 40.","Thus, therefore, when I had heard and considered what they said, I left them, and went about my employment again, but their talk and discourse went with me; also my heart would tarry with them, for I was greatly affected with their words, both because by them I was convinced that I wanted the true tokens of a truly godly man, and also because by them I was convinced of the happy and blessed condition of him that was such a one.",[19] 41.,"Therefore I should often make it my business to be going again and again into the company of these poor people, for I could not stay away; and the more I went amongst them, the more did question my condition; and as I still do remember, presently I found two things within me, at which I did sometimes marvel, especially considering what a blind, ignorant, sordid, and ungodly wretch but just before I was; the one was a very great softness and tenderness of heart, which caused me to fall under the conviction of what by Scripture they asserted; and the other was a great bending in my mind to a continual meditating on it, and on all other good things which at any time I heard or read of.",42.,"'By these things' my mind was now so turned, that it lay like a horse leech at the vein, still crying out, Give, give (Prov 30:15); yea, it was so fixed on eternity, and on the things about the kingdom of heaven, that is, so far as I knew, though as yet, God knows, I knew but little; that neither pleasures, nor profits, nor persuasions, nor threats, could loosen it, or make it let go his hold; and though I may speak it with shame, yet it is in very deed a certain truth, it would then have been as difficult for me to have taken my mind from heaven to earth, as I have found it often since to get it again from earth to heaven.'",43.,"'One thing I may not omit: There was a young man in our town, to whom my heart before was knit more than to any other, but he being a most wicked creature for cursing, and swearing, and whoring, I now shook him off, and forsook his company; but about a quarter of a year after I had left him, I met him in a certain lane, and asked him how he did; he, after his old swearing and mad way, answered, He was well.","But, Harry, said I, why do you swear and curse thus?","What will become of you, if you die in this condition?","He answered me in a great chafe, What would the devil do for company, if it were not for such as I am?'",44.,"'About this time I met with some Ranters' books, that were put forth by some of our countrymen, which books were also highly in esteem by several old professors; some of these I read, but was not able to make a judgment about them; wherefore as I read in them, and thought upon them, feeling myself unable to judge, I should betake myself to hearty prayer in this manner: O Lord, I am a fool, and not able to know the truth from error: Lord, leave me not to my own blindness, either to approve of, or condemn this doctrine; if it be of God, let me not despise it; if it be of the devil, let me not embrace it.","Lord, I lay my soul, in this matter, only at thy foot; let me not be deceived, I humbly beseech thee.","I had one religious intimate companion all this while, and that was the poor man that I spoke of before; but about this time he also turned a most devilish Ranter,[20] and gave himself up to all manner of filthiness, especially uncleanness: he would also deny that there was a God, angel, or spirit; and would laugh at all exhortations to sobriety.","When I laboured to rebuke his wickedness, he would laugh the more, and pretend that he had gone through all religions, and could never light on the right till now.","He told me also, that in a little time I should see all professors turn to the ways of the Ranters.","Wherefore, abominating those cursed principles, I left his company forthwith, and became to him as great a stranger, as I had been before a familiar.'",45.,"'Neither was this man only a temptation to me; but my calling lying in the country, I happened to light into several people's company, who, though strict in religion formerly, yet were also swept away by these Ranters.","These would also talk with me of their ways, and condemn me as legal and dark; pretending that they only had attained to perfection that could do what they would, and not sin.",Oh!,"These temptations were suitable to my flesh, I being but a young man, and my nature in its prime; but God, who had, as I hope, designed me for better things, kept me in the fear of his name, and did not suffer me to accept of such cursed principles.","And blessed be God, who put it into my heart to cry to him to be kept and directed, still distrusting mine own wisdom; for I have since seen even the effect of that prayer, in his preserving me not only from ranting errors, but from those also that have sprung up since.",The Bible was precious to me in those days.',46.,"And now, methought, I began to look into the Bible with new eyes, and read as I never did before; and especially the epistles of the apostle Paul were sweet and pleasant to me; and, indeed, I was then never out of the Bible, either by reading or meditation; still crying out to God, that I might know the truth, and way to heaven and glory.",47.,"And as I went on and read, I lighted on that passage, 'To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; and to another faith,' &c. (1 Cor 12:8,9).","And though, as I have since seen, that by this Scripture the Holy Ghost intends, in special, things extraordinary, yet on me it did then fasten with conviction, that I did want things ordinary, even that understanding and wisdom that other Christians had.","On this word I mused, and could not tell what to do, 'especially this word faith put me to it, for I could not help it, but sometimes must question, whether I had any faith or no'; for I feared that it shut me out of all the blessings that other good people had give them of God;[21] but I was loath to conclude I had no faith in my soul; for if I do so, thought I, then I shall count myself a very cast-away indeed.",48.,"No, said I with myself, though I am convinced that I am an ignorant sot, and that I want those blessed gifts of knowledge and understanding that other good people have; yet, at a venture, I will conclude I am not altogether faithless, though I know not what faith is.","For it was showed me, and that too, as I have since seen, by Satan, that those who conclude themselves in a faithless state, have neither rest nor quiet in their souls; and I was loath to fall quite into despair.",49.,"Wherefore, by this suggestion, I was for a while made afraid to see my want of faith; but God would not suffer me thus to undo and destroy my soul, but did continually, against this my blind and sad conclusion, create still within me such suppositions, 'insomuch' that I might in this deceive myself, that I could not rest content, until I did now come to some certain knowledge, whether I had faith or no; this always running in my mind, But how if you want faith indeed?",But how can you tell you have faith?,"'and, besides, I saw for certain, if I had not, I was sure to perish for ever.'",50.,"So that though I endeavoured at the first, to look over the business of faith, yet in a little time, I better considering the matter, was willing to put myself upon the trial, whether I had faith or no.","But, alas, poor wretch, so ignorant and brutish was I, that I knew to this day no more how to do it, than I know how to begin and accomplish that rare and curious piece of art, which I never yet saw not considered.",51.,"Wherefore, while I was thus considering, and being put to my plunge about it, for you must know, that as yet I had in this matter broken my mind to no man, only did hear and consider, the tempter came in with his delusion, That there was no way for me to know I had faith, but by trying to work some miracle; urging those Scriptures that seem to look that way, for the enforcing and strengthening his temptation.","Nay, one day as I was betwixt Elstow and Bedford, the temptation was hot upon me, to try if I had faith, by doing of some miracle: which miracle at that time was this, I must say to the puddles that were in the horse pads, Be dry; and to the dry places, Be you the puddles.","And truly, one time I was agoing to say so indeed; but just as I was about to speak, this thought came into my mind, But go under yonder hedge and pray first, that God would make you able.","But when I had concluded to pray, this came hot upon me, That if I prayed, and came again and tried to do it, and yet did nothing notwithstanding, then be sure I had no faith, but was a cast-away and lost.","Nay, thought I, if it be so, I will never try yet, but will stay a little longer.",52.,"So I continued at a great loss; for I thought, if they only had faith, which could do so wonderful things, then I concluded, that, for the present, I neither had it, nor yet, for time to come, were ever like to have it.","Thus I was tossed betwixt the devil and my own ignorance, and so perplexed, especially at some times, that I could not tell what to do.",53.,"About this time, the state and happiness of these poor people at Bedford was thus, in a dream or vision, represented to me.","I saw, as if they were set on the sunny side of some high mountain, there refreshing themselves with the pleasant beams of the sun, while I was shivering and shrinking in the cold, afflicted with frost, snow, and dark clouds.","Methought, also, betwixt me and them, I saw a wall that did compass about this mountain; now, through this wall my soul did greatly desire to pass; concluding, that if I could, I would go even into the very midst of them, and there also comfort myself with the heat of their sun.",54.,"About this wall I thought myself, to go again and again, still prying as I went, to see if I could find some way or passage, by which I might enter therein; but none could I find for some time.","At the last, I saw, as it were, a narrow gap, like a little doorway in the wall, through which I attempted to pass; but the passage being very strait and narrow, I made many efforts to get in, but all in vain, even until I was well nigh quite beat out, by striving to get in; at last, with great striving, methought I at first did get in my head, and after that, by a sidling striving, my shoulders, and my whole body; then was I exceeding glad, and went and sat down in the midst of them, and so was comforted with the light and heat of their sun.",55.,"Now, this mountain and wall, &c., was thus made out to me--the mountain signified the church of the living God; the sun that shone thereon, the comfortable shining of his merciful face on them that were therein; the wall, I thought, was the Word, that did make separation between the Christians and the world; and the gap which was in this wall, I thought, was Jesus Christ, who is the way to God the Father (John 14:6; Matt 7:14).","But forasmuch as the passage was wonderful narrow, even so narrow, that I could not, but with great difficulty, enter in thereat, it showed me that none could enter into life, but those that were in downright earnest,[22] and unless also they left this wicked world behind them; for here was only room for body and soul, but not for body and soul, and sin.",[23] 56.,"This resemblance abode upon my spirit many days; all which time, I saw myself in a forlorn and sad condition, but yet was provoked to a vehement hunger and desire to be one of that number that did sit in the sunshine.","Now also I should pray wherever I was, whether at home or abroad, in house or field, and should also often, with lifting up of heart, sing that of the 51st Psalm, O Lord, consider my distress; for as yet I knew not where I was.",57.,"Neither as yet could I attain to any comfortable persuasion that I had faith in Christ; but instead of having satisfaction, here I began to find my soul to be assaulted with fresh doubts about my future happiness; especially with such as these, Whether I was elected?","But how, if the day of grace should now be past and gone?",58.,"By these two temptations I was very much afflicted and disquieted; sometimes by one, and sometimes by the other of them.","And first, to speak of that about my questioning my election, I found at this time, that though I was in a flame to find the way to heaven and glory, and though nothing could beat me off from this, yet this question did so offend and discourage me, that I was, especially at some times, as if the very strength of my body also had been taken away by the force and power thereof.","This scripture did also seem to me to trample upon all my desires, ""It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy"" (Rom 9:16).",59.,"With this scripture I could not tell what to do; for I evidently saw, that unless the great God, of his infinite grace and bounty, had voluntarily chosen me to be a vessel of mercy, though I should desire, and long and labour until my heart did break, no good could come of it.","Therefore, this would still stick with me, How can you tell that you are elected?",And what if you should not?,How then?,60.,"O Lord, thought I, what if I should not, indeed?","It may be you are not, said the tempter; it may be so, indeed, thought I.","Why, then, said Satan, you had as good leave off, and strive no further; for if, indeed, you should not be elected and chosen of God, there is no talk of your being saved; ""For it is neither of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.""",61.,"By these things I was driven to my wits' end, not knowing what to say, or how to answer these temptations.","Indeed, I little thought that Satan had thus assaulted me, but that rather it was my own prudence, thus to start the question; for, that the elect only attained eternal life, that I, without scruple, did heartily close withal; but that myself was one of them, there lay all the question.",62.,"Thus, therefore, for several days, I was greatly assaulted and perplexed, and was often, when I have been walking, ready to sink where I went, with faintness in my mind; but one day, after I had been so many weeks oppressed and cast down therewith, as I was now quite giving up the ghost of all my hopes of ever attaining life, that sentence fell with weight upon my spirit, ""Look at the generations of old and see; did ever any trust in the Lord, and was confounded?""",63.,"At which I was greatly lightened and encouraged in my soul; for thus, at that very instant, it was expounded to me, Begin at the beginning of Genesis, and read to the end of the Revelation, and see if you can find that there was ever any that trusted in the Lord, and was confounded.","So, coming home, I presently went to my Bible to see if I could find that saying, not doubting but to find it presently; for it was so fresh, and with such strength and comfort on my spirit, that I was as if it talked with me.",64.,"Well, I looked, but I found it not; only it abode upon me; then I did ask first this good man, and then another, if they knew where it was, but they knew no such place.","At this I wondered, that such a sentence should so suddenly, and with such comfort and strength, seize and abide upon my heart, and yet that none could find it, for I doubted not but it was in holy Scripture.",65.,"Thus I continued above a year, and could not find the place; but at last, casting my eye into the Apocrypha books, I found it in Ecclesiasticus 2:10.","This, at the first, did somewhat daunt me; but because, by this time, I had got more experience of the love and kindness of God, it troubled me the less; especially when I considered, that though it was not in those texts that we call holy and canonical, yet forasmuch as this sentence was the sum and substance of many of the promises, it was my duty to take the comfort of it; and I bless God for that word, for it was of God to me: that word doth still, at times, shine before my face.",66.,"After this, that other doubt did come with strength upon me, But how if the day of grace should be past and gone?",How if you have over-stood the time of mercy?,"Now, I remember that one day, as I was walking into the country, I was much in the thoughts of this, But how if the day of grace be past?","And to aggravate my trouble, the tempter presented to my mind those good people of Bedford, and suggested thus unto me, That these being converted already, they were all that God would save in those parts; and that I came too late, for these had got the blessing before I came.",67.,"Now was I in great distress, thinking in very deed that this might well be so; wherefore I went up and down bemoaning my sad condition, counting myself far worse than a thousand fools, for standing off thus long, and spending so many years in sin as I had done; still crying out, Oh, that I had turned sooner; Oh, that I had turned seven years ago!","It made me also angry with myself, to think that I should have no more wit, but to trifle away my time till my soul and heaven were lost.",68.,"But when I had been long vexed with this fear, and was scarce able to take one step more, just about the same place where I received my other encouragement, these words broke in upon my mind, ""Compel them to come in, that my house may be filled""; ""and yet there is room"" (Luke 14:22,23).","These words, but especially them, ""And yet there is room"" were sweet words to me; for, truly, I thought that by them I saw there was place enough in heaven for me; and, moreover, that when the Lord Jesus did speak these words, he then did think of me; and that he knowing that the time would come that I should be afflicted with fear that there was no place left for me in his bosom, did before speak this word, and leave it upon record, that I might find help thereby against this vile temptations.","'This, I then verily believed.'",69.,"In the light and encouragement of this word, I went a pretty while; and the comfort was the more, when I thought that the Lord Jesus should think on me so long ago, and that he should speak them words on purpose for my sake; for I did then think, verily, that he did on purpose speak them, to encourage me withal.",70.,"'But I was not without my temptations to go back again; temptations, I say, both from Satan, mine own heart, and carnal acquaintance; but I thank God these were outweighed by that sound sense of death and of the day of judgment, which abode, as it were, continually in my view; I should often also think on Nebuchadnezzar, of whom it is said, He had given him all the kingdoms of the earth (Dan 5:19).","Yet, thought I, if this great man had all his portion in this world, one hour in hell fire would make him forget all.",Which consideration was a great help to me.',71.,"'I was almost made, about this time, to see something concerning the beasts that Moses counted clean and unclean.","I thought those beasts were types of men; the clean, types of them that were the people of God; but the unclean, types of such as were the children of the wicked one.","Now, I read that the clean beasts chewed the cud; that is, thought I, they show us we must feed upon the Word of God.","They also parted the hoof; I thought that signified we must part, if we would be saved, with the ways of ungodly men.","And also, in further reading about them I found, that though we did chew the cud as the hare, yet if we walked with claws like a dog, or if we did part the hoof like the swine, yet if we did not chew the cud as the sheep, we were still, for all that, but unclean; for I thought the here to be a type of those that talk of the Word, yet walk in the ways of sin; and that the swine was like him that parteth with his outward pollutions, but still wanteth the Word of faith, without which there could be no way of salvation, let a man be never so devout (Deut 14).'","After this I found, by reading the Word, that those that must be glorified with Christ in another world must be called by him here; called to the partaking of a share in his Word and righteousness, and to the comforts and first fruits of his spirit, and to a peculiar interest in all those heavenly things which do indeed fore fit the soul for that rest and house of glory which is in heaven above.",72.,"Here, again, I was at a very great stand, not knowing what to do, fearing I was not called; for, thought I, if I be not called, what then can do me good?","'None but those who are effectually called, inherit the kingdom of heaven.'",But oh!,how I now loved those words that spake of a Christian's calling!,"as when the Lord said to one, ""Follow me,"" and to another, ""Come after me.""",And oh!,"thought I, that he would say so to me too, how gladly would I run after him!",73.,I cannot now express with what longings and breakings in my soul I cried to Christ to call me.,"Thus I continued for a time, all on a flame to be converted to Jesus Christ; and did also see at that day, such glory in a converted state, that I could not be contented without a share therein.",Gold!,"could it have been gotten for gold, what could I have given for it!","had I had a whole world it had all gone ten thousand times over for this, that my soul might have been in a converted state.",74.,How lovely now was every one in my eyes that I thought to be converted men and women!,"they shone, they walked like a people that carried the broad seal of heaven about them.",Oh!,"I saw the lot was fallen to them in pleasant places, and they had a goodly heritage (Psa 16:6).","But that which made me sick was that of Christ, in Mark, He went up into a mountain and called to him whom he would, and they came unto him (Mark 3:13).",75.,"This scripture made me faint and fear, yet it kindled fire in my soul.","That which made me fear was this, lest Christ should have no liking to me, for he called ""whom he would.""",But oh!,"the glory that I saw in that condition did still so engage my heart that I could seldom read of any that Christ did call but I presently wished, Would I had been in their clothes; would I had been born Peter; would I had been born John; or would I had been by and had heard him when he called them, how would I have cried, O Lord, call me also.",But oh!,I feared he would not call me.,76.,"And truly the Lord let me go thus many months together and showed me nothing; either that I was already, or should be called hereafter.","But at last, after much time spent, and many groans to God, that I might be made partaker of the holy and heavenly calling, that Word came in upon me--""I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed, for the Lord dwelleth in Zion"" (Joel 3:21).","These words I thought were sent to encourage me to wait still upon God, and signified unto me, that if I were not already, yet time might come I might be in truth converted unto Christ.",[24] 77.,"About this time I began to break my mind to those poor people in Bedford, and to tell them my condition, which, when they had heard, they told Mr. Gifford of me, who himself also took occasion to talk with me, and was willing to be 'well' persuaded of me, though I think but from little grounds: but he invited me to his house, where I should hear him confer with others, about the dealings of God with the soul; from all which I still received more conviction, and from that time began to see something of the vanity and inward wretchedness of my wicked heart, for as yet I knew no great matter therein; but now it began to be discovered unto me, and also to work at that rate for wickedness as it never did before.","Now I evidently found that lusts and corruptions would strongly put forth themselves within me, in wicked thoughts and desires, which I did not regard before; my desires also for heaven and life began to fail.","I found also, that whereas before my soul was full of longing after God, now my heart began to hanker after every foolish vanity; yea, my heart would not be moved to mind that that was good; it began to be careless, both of my soul and heaven; it would now continually hang back, both to, and in every duty; and was as a clog on the leg of a bird to hinder her from flying.",78.,"Nay, thought I, now I grow worse and worse; now am I further from conversion than ever I was before.","Wherefore I began to sink greatly in my soul, and began to entertain such discouragement in my heart as laid me low as hell.","If now I should have burned at a stake, I could not believe that Christ had love for me; alas, I could neither hear him, nor see him, nor feel him, nor savour any of his things; I was driven as with a tempest, my heart would be unclean, the Canaanites would dwell in the land.",79.,"Sometimes I would tell my condition to the people of God, which, when they heard, they would pity me, and would tell me of the promises; but they had as good have told me that I must reach the sun with my finger as have bidden me receive or rely upon the promise; and as soon as I should have done it, all my sense and feeling was against me; and I saw I had a heart that would sin, and 'that' lay under a law that would condemn.",80.,"These things have often made me think of that child which the father brought to Christ, who, while he was yet a coming to him, was thrown down by the devil, and also so rent and torn by him that he lay and wallowed, foaming (Luke 9:42; Mark 9:20).",81.,"Further, in these days I should find my heart to shut itself up against the Lord, and against his holy Word.","I have found my unbelief to set, as it were, the shoulder to the door to keep him out, and that too even then, when I have with many a bitter sigh cried, Good Lord, break it open; Lord, break these gates of brass, and cut these bars of iron asunder (Psa 107:16).","Yet that word would sometimes create in my heart a peaceable pause, ""I girded thee, though thou hast not known me"" (Isa 45:5).",82.,"But all this while as to the act of sinning, I never was more tender than now; I durst not take a pin or a stick, though but so big as a straw, for my conscience now was sore, and would smart at every touch; I could not now tell how to speak my words, for fear I should misplace them.","Oh, how gingerly[25] did I then go in all I did or said!","I found myself as on a miry bog that shook if I did but stir; and 'was' there left both of God and Christ, and the Spirit, and all good things.",83.,"'But, I observe, though I was such a great sinner before conversion, yet God never much charged the guilt of the sins of my ignorance upon me; only he showed me I was lost if I had not Christ, because I had been a sinner; I saw that I wanted a perfect righteousness to present me without fault before God, and this righteousness was nowhere to be found, but in the person of Jesus Christ.'",84.,"'But my original and inward pollution, that, that was my plague and my affliction; that, I say, at a dreadful rate, always putting forth itself within me; that I had the guilt of, to amazement; by reason of that, I was more loathsome in my own eyes than was a toad; and I thought I was so in God's eyes too; sin and corruption, I said, would as naturally bubble out of my heart, as water would bubble out of a fountain.",I thought now that every one had a better heart than I had; I could have changed heart with any body; I thought none but the devil himself could equalize me for inward wickedness and pollution of mind.,"I fell, therefore, at the sight of my own vileness, deeply into despair; for I concluded that this condition that I was in could not stand with a state of grace.","Sure, thought I, I am forsaken of God; sure I am given up to the devil, and to a reprobate mind; and thus I continued a long while, even for some years together.'",85.,"'While I was thus afflicted with the fears of my own damnation, there were two things would make me wonder; the one was, when I saw old people hunting after the things of this life, as if they should live here always; the other was, when I found professors much distressed and cast down, when they met with outward losses; as of husband, wife, child, &c. Lord, thought I, what ado is here about such little things as these!","What seeking after carnal things by some, and what grief in others for the loss of them!","if they so much labour after, and spend so many tears for the things of this present life, how am I to be bemoaned, pitied, and prayed for!","My soul is dying, my soul is damning.","Were my soul but in a good condition, and were I but sure of it, ah!","how rich should I esteem myself, though blessed but with bread and water; I should count those but small afflictions, and should bear them as little burdens.","""A wounded spirit who can bear?""'",86.,"And though I was thus troubled, and tossed, and afflicted, with the sight and sense and terror of my own wickedness, yet I was afraid to let this sight and sense go quite off my mind; for I found, that unless guilt of conscience was taken off the right way, that is, by the blood of Christ, a man grew rather worse for the loss of his trouble of mind, than better.","Wherefore, if my guilt lay hard upon me, then I should cry that the blood of Christ might take it off; and if it was going off without it (for the sense of sin would be sometimes as if it would die, and go quite away), then I would also strive to fetch it upon my heart again, by bringing the punishment for sin in hell fire upon my spirits; and should cry, Lord, let it not go off my heart, but the right way, but by the blood of Christ, and by the application of thy mercy, through him, to my soul; for that Scripture lay much upon me, ""without shedding of blood is no remission"" (Heb 9:22).","And that which made me the more afraid of this was, because I had seen some, who, though when they were under wounds of conscience, then they would cry and pray; but they seeking rather present ease from their trouble, than pardon for their sin, cared not how they lost their guilt, so they got it out of their mind; and, therefore, having got it off the wrong way, it was not sanctified unto them; but they grew harder and blinder, and more wicked after their trouble.","This made me afraid, and made me cry to God 'the more,' that it might not be so with me.",87.,"And now was I sorry that God had made me a man, for I feared I was a reprobate; I counted man as unconverted, the most doleful of all the creatures.","Thus being afflicted and tossed about my sad condition, I counted myself alone, and above the most of men unblessed.",88.,"'Yea, I thought it impossible that ever I should attain to so much goodness of heart, as to thank God that he had made me a man.","Man indeed is the most noble by creation, of all creatures in the visible world; but by sin he had made himself the most ignoble.","The beasts, birds, fishes, &c., I blessed their condition, for they had not a sinful nature, they were not obnoxious to the wrath of God; they were not to go to hell fire after death; I could therefore have rejoiced, had my condition been as any of theirs.'",89.,"In this condition I went a great while; but when comforting time was come, I heard one preach a sermon upon those words in the Song (4:1), ""Behold thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair.""","But at that time he made these two words, ""My love,"" his chief and subject matter; from which, after he had a little opened the text, he observed these several conclusions: 1.","That the church, and so every saved soul, is Christ's love, when loveless.",2.,Christ's love without a cause.,3.,Christ's love when hated of the world.,4.,"Christ's love when under temptation, and under desertion.",5.,Christ's love from first to last.,90.,"But I got nothing by what he said at present, only when he came to the application of the fourth particular, this was the word he said; If it be so, that the saved soul is Christ's love when under temptation and desertion; then poor tempted soul, when thou art assaulted and afflicted with temptation, and the hidings of God's face, yet think on these two words, ""My love,"" still.",91.,"So as I was a going home, these words came again into my thoughts; and I well remember, as they came in, I said thus in my heart, What shall I get by thinking on these two words?","This thought had no sooner passed through my heart, but the words began thus to kindle in my spirit, ""Thou art my love, thou art my love,"" twenty times together; and still as they ran thus in my mind, they waxed stronger and warmer, and began to make me look up; but being as yet between hope and fear, I still replied in my heart, But is it true, but is it true?","At which, that sentence fell in upon me, He ""wist not that it was true which was done by the angel"" (Acts 12:9).",92.,"Then I began to give place to the word, which, with power, did over and over make this joyful sound within my soul, thou art my love, thou art my love; and nothing shall separate thee from my love; and with that (Rom 8:39) came into my mind: Now was my heart filled full of comfort and hope, and now I could believe that my sins should be forgiven me; 'yea, I was now so taken with the love and mercy of God, that I remember I could not tell how to contain till I got home; I thought I could have spoken of his love, and of his mercy to me, even to the very crows that sat upon the ploughed lands before me, had they been capable to have understood me'; wherefore I said in my soul, with much gladness, well, I would I had a pen and ink here, I would write this down before I go any further, for surely I will not forget this forty years hence; but, alas!","within less than forty days, I began to question all again; 'which made me begin to question all still.'",93.,"Yet still at times, I was helped to believe that it was a true manifestation of grace unto my soul, though I had lost much of the life and savour of it.","Now about a week or fortnight after this, I was much followed by this scripture, ""Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you"" (Luke 22:31).","And sometimes it would sound so loud within me, yea, and as it were call so strongly after me, that once above all the rest, I turned my head over my shoulder, thinking verily that some man had, behind me, called to me; being at a great distance, 'methought he called so loud; it came, as I have thought since, to have stirred me up to prayer, and to watchfulness; it came to acquaint me that a cloud and a storm was coming down upon me, but I understood it not.",'[26] 94.,"'Also, as I remember, that time that it called to me so loud, was the last time that it sounded in mine ear; but methinks I hear still with what a loud voice these words, Simon, Simon, sounded in mine ears.","I thought verily, as I have told you, that somebody had called after me, that was half a mile behind me; and although that was not my name, yet it made me suddenly look behind me, believing that he that called so loud meant me.'",95.,"But so foolish was I, and ignorant, that I knew not the reason of this sound; which, as I did both see and feel soon after, was sent from heaven as an alarm, to awaken me to provide for what was coming; only it would make me muse and wonder in my mind, to think what should be the reason that this scripture, and that at this rate, so often and so loud, should still be sounding and rattling in mine ears; but, as I said before, I soon after perceived the end of God therein.",96.,"For about the space of a month after, a very great storm came down upon me, which handled me twenty times worse than all I had met with before; it came stealing upon me, now by one piece, then by another; first, all my comfort was taken from me, then darkness seized upon me, after which, whole floods of blasphemies, both against God, Christ, and the Scriptures, were poured upon my spirit, to my great confusion and astonishment.","These blasphemous thoughts were such as also stirred up questions in me, against the very being of God, and of his only beloved Son; as, whether there were, in truth, a God, or Christ, or no?","and whether the holy Scriptures were not rather a fable, and cunning story, than the holy and pure Word of God?",97.,"The tempter would also much assault me with this, how can you tell but that the Turks had as good Scriptures to prove their Mahomet the Saviour, as we have to prove our Jesus is?","And, could I think, that so many ten thousands, in so many countries and kingdoms, should be without the knowledge of the right way to heaven; if there were indeed a heaven, and that we only, who live in a corner of the earth, should alone be blessed therewith?","Every one doth think his own religion rightest, both Jews and Moors, and Pagans!","and how if all our faith, and Christ, and Scriptures, should be but a think-so too?",98.,"Sometimes I have endeavoured to argue against these suggestions, and to set some of the sentences of blessed Paul against them; but, alas!","I quickly felt, when I thus did, such arguings as these would return again upon me, Though we made so great a matter of Paul, and of his words, yet how could I tell, but that in very deed, he being a subtle and cunning man, might give himself up to deceive with strong delusions; and also take both that pains and travel, to undo and destroy his fellows.",99.,"These suggestions, with many other which at this time I may not, nor dare not utter, neither by word nor pen, did make such a seizure upon my spirit, and did so overweigh my heart, both with their number, continuance, and fiery force, that I felt as if there were nothing else but these from morning to night within me; and as though, indeed, there could be room for nothing else; and also concluded, that God had, in very wrath to my soul, given me up unto them, to be carried away with them, as with a mighty whirlwind.",100.,"Only by the distaste that they gave unto my spirit, I felt there was something in me, that refused to embrace them.","But this consideration I then only had, when God gave me leave to swallow my spittle, otherwise the noise, and strength, and force of these temptations, would drown and overflow; and as it were, bury all such thoughts or the remembrance of any such thing.","While I was in this temptation, I should often find my mind suddenly put upon it, to curse and swear, or to speak some grievous thing against God, or Christ his Son, and of the Scriptures.",[27] 101.,"Now I thought, surely I am possessed of the devil; at other times again, I thought I should be bereft of my wits; for instead of lauding and magnifying God the Lord with others, if I have but heard him spoken of, presently some most horrible blasphemous thought or other, would bolt out of my heart against him; so that whether I did think that God was, or again did think there were no such thing; no love, nor peace, nor gracious disposition could I feel within me.",102.,"These things did sink me into very deep despair; for I concluded, that such things could not possibly be found amongst them that loved God.","I often, when these temptations have been with force upon me, did compare myself in the case of such a child, whom some gipsy hath by force took up under her apron,[28] and is carrying from friend and country; kick sometimes I did, and also scream and cry; but yet I was as bound in the wings of the temptation, and the wind would carry me away.","I thought also of Saul, and of the evil spirit that did possess him; and did greatly fear that my condition was the same with that of his (1 Sam 16:14).",103.,"In these days, when I have heard others talk of what was the sin against the Holy Ghost, then would the tempter so provoke me to desire to sin that sin, that I was as if I could not, must not, neither should be quiet until I had committed that; now, no sin would serve but that; if it were to be committed by speaking of such a word, then I have been as if my mouth would have spoken that word, whether I would or no; and in so strong a measure was this temptation upon me, that often I have been ready to clap my hand under my chin, to hold my mouth from opening; and to that end also I have had thoughts at other times, to leap with my head downward, into some muck hill hole or other, to keep my mouth from speaking.",104.,"Now I blessed the condition of the dog and toad, and counted the estate of everything that God had made far better than this dreadful state of mine, and such as my companions was; yea, gladly would I have been in the condition of dog or horse, for I knew they had no soul to perish under the everlasting weights of hell for sin, as mine was like to do.","Nay, and though I saw this, felt this, and was broken to pieces with it, yet that which added to my sorrow was, that I could not find that with all my soul I did desire deliverance.","That scripture did also tear and rend my soul, in the midst of these distractions, ""The wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.","There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked"" (Isa 57:20,21).",105.,"'And now my heart was, at times, exceeding hard; if I would have given a thousand pounds for a tear, I could not shed one; no, nor sometimes scarce desire to shed one.",I was much dejected to think that this should be my lot.,"I saw some could mourn and lament their sin; and others, again, could rejoice, and bless God for Christ; and others, again, could quietly talk of, and with gladness remember, the Word of God; while I only was in the storm or tempest.",This much sunk me; I thought my condition was alone.,"I should, therefore, much bewail my hard hap; but get out of, or get rid of, these things, I could not.'",106.,"While this temptation lasted, which was about a year, I could attend upon none of the ordinances of God but with sore and great affliction.","Yea, then was I most distressed with blasphemies; if I have been hearing the Word, then uncleanness, blasphemies, and despair would hold me as captive there; if I have been reading, then, sometimes, I had sudden thoughts to question all I read; sometimes, again, my mind would be so strangely snatched away, and possessed with other things, that I have neither known, nor regarded, nor remembered so much as the sentence that but now I have read.",107.,"In prayer, also, I have been greatly troubled at this time; sometimes I have thought I should see the devil, nay, thought I have felt him, behind me, pull my clothes; he would be, also, continually at me in the time of prayer to have done; break off, make haste, you have prayed enough, and stay no longer, still drawing my mind away.","Sometimes, also, he would cast in such wicked thoughts as these: that I must pray to him, or for him.","I have thought sometimes of that--Fall down, or, ""if thou wilt fall down and worship me"" (Matt 4:9).",108.,"Also, when, because I have had wandering thoughts in the time of this duty, I have laboured to compose my mind and fix it upon God, then, with great force, hath the tempter laboured to distract me, and confound me, and to turn away my mind, by presenting to my heart and fancy the form of a bush, a bull, a besom, or the like, as if I should pray to those; to these he would, also, at some times especially, so hold my mind that I was as if I could think of nothing else, or pray to nothing else but to these, or such as they.",109.,"Yet, at times I should have some strong and heart-affecting apprehensions of God, and the reality of the truth of his gospel; but, oh!","how would my heart, at such times, put forth itself with inexpressible groanings.","My whole soul was then in every word; I should cry with pangs after God that he would be merciful unto me; but then I should be daunted again with such conceits as these; I should think that God did mock at these, my prayers, saying, and that in the audience of the holy angels, This poor simple wretch doth hanker after me as if I had nothing to do with my mercy but to bestow it on such as he.","Alas, poor fool!",[29] how art thou deceived!,It is not for such as thee to have a favour with the Highest.,110.,"Then hath the tempter come upon me, also, with such discouragements as these--You are very hot for mercy, but I will cool you; this frame shall not last always; many have been as hot as you for a spirit, but I have quenched their zeal.","And with this, such and such who were fallen off would be set before mine eyes.","Then I should be afraid that I should do so too; but, thought I, I am glad this comes into my mind.","Well, I will watch, and take what heed I can.","Though you do, said Satan, I shall be too hard for you; I will cool you insensibly, by degrees, by little and little.","What care I, saith he, though I be seven years in chilling your heart if I can do it at last?",Continual rocking will lull a crying child asleep.,"I will ply it close, but I will have my end accomplished.","Though you be burning hot at present, yet, if I can pull you from this fire, I shall have you cold before it be long.",111.,"These things brought me into great straits; for as I at present could not find myself fit for present death, so I thought to live long would make me yet more unfit; for time would make me forget all, and wear even the remembrance of the evil of sin, the worth of heaven, and the need I had of the blood of Christ to wash me, both out of mind and thought; but I thank Christ Jesus these things did not at present make me slack my crying, but rather did put me more upon it, like her who met with the adulterer (Deut 22:27); in which days that was a good word to me after I had suffered these things a while: ""I am persuaded that neither-height, nor depth, nor life,"" &c., ""shall--separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus"" (Rom 8:38).","And now I hoped long life should not destroy me, nor make me miss of heaven.",112.,"Yet I had some supports in this temptation, though they were then all questioned by me; that in the third of Jeremiah, at the first, was something to me, and so was the consideration of the fifth verse of that chapter; that though we have spoken and done as evil things as we could, yet we should cry unto God, ""My Father, thou art the guide of my youth""; and should return unto him.",113.,"I had, also, once a sweet glance from that in 2 Corinthians 5:21: ""For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.""","I remember, also, that one day as I was sitting in a neighbour's house, and there very sad at the consideration of my many blasphemies, and as I was saying in my mind, What ground have I to think that I, who have been so vile and abominable, should ever inherit eternal life?","that word came suddenly upon me, ""What shall we then say to these things?","If God be for us, who can be against us?""",(Rom 8:31).,"That, also, was an help unto me, ""Because I live, ye shall live also"" (John 14:19).","But these were but hints, touches, and short visits, though very sweet when present; only they lasted not; but, like to Peter's sheet, of a sudden were caught up from me to heaven again (Acts 10:16).",114.,"But afterwards the Lord did more fully and graciously discover himself unto me; and, indeed, did quite, not only deliver me from the guilt that, by these things, was laid upon my conscience, but also from the very filth thereof; for the temptation was removed, and I was put into my right mind again, as other Christians were.",115.,"I remember that one day, as I was traveling into the country and musing on the wickedness and blasphemy of my heart, and considering of the enmity that was in me to God, that scripture came in my mind, He hath ""made peace through the blood of his cross"" (Col 1:20).","By which I was made to see, both again, and again, and again, that day, that God and my soul were friends by this blood; yea, I saw that the justice of God and my sinful soul could embrace and kiss each other through this blood.",This was a good day to me; I hope I shall not forget it.,116.,"At another time, as I sat by the fire in my house, and musing on my wretchedness, the Lord made that also a precious word unto me, ""Forasmuch, then, as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver them who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime subject to bondage"" (Heb 2:14,15).","I thought that the glory of these words was then so weighty on me that I was, both once and twice, ready to swoon as I sat; yet not with grief and trouble, but with solid joy and peace.","[BUNYAN ATTENDS THE MINISTRY OF MR. GIFFORD, AND BECOMES INTENSELY EARNEST TO UNDERSTAND THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL.]",117.,"At this time, also, I sat under the ministry of holy Mr. Gifford, whose doctrine, by God's grace, was much for my stability.","[30] This man made it much his business to deliver the people of God from all those false and unsound rests that, by nature, we are prone to take and make to our souls.","He pressed us to take special heed that we took not up any truth upon trust--as from this, or that, or any other man or men--but to cry mightily to God that he would convince us of the reality thereof, and set us down therein, by his own Spirit, in the holy Word; for, said he, if you do otherwise when temptations come, if strongly, you, not having received them with evidence from heaven, will find you want that help and strength now to resist as once you thought you had.",118.,"This was as seasonable to my soul as the former and latter rain in their season; for I had found, and that by sad experience, the truth of these his words; for I had felt [what] no man can say, especially when tempted by the devil, that Jesus Christ is Lord but by the Holy Ghost.","Wherefore I found my soul, through grace, very apt to drink in this doctrine, and to incline to pray to God that, in nothing that pertained to God's glory and my own eternal happiness, he would suffer me to be without the confirmation thereof from heaven; for now I saw clearly there was an exceeding different betwixt the notions of flesh and blood, and the revelations of God in heaven; also, a great difference between that faith that is feigned, and according to man's wisdom, and of that which comes by a man's being born thereto of God (Matt 16:15-17; 1 John 5:1).",119.,"But, oh!","now, how was my soul led from truth to truth by God!",even from the birth and cradle of the Son of God to his ascension and second coming from heaven to judge the world.,120.,"Truly, I then found, upon this account, the great God was very good unto me; for, to my remembrance, there was not anything that I then cried unto God to make known and reveal unto me but he was pleased to do it for me; I mean not one part of the gospel of the Lord Jesus, but I was orderly led into it.","Methought I saw with great evidence, from the relation of the four evangelists, the wonderful work of God, in giving Jesus Christ to save us, from his conception and birth even to his second coming to judgment, Methought I was as if I had seen him born, as if I had seen him grow up, as if I had seen him walk through this world, from the cradle to his cross; to which, also, when he came, I saw how gently he gave himself to be hanged and nailed on it for my sins and wicked doings.","Also, as I was musing on this, his progress, that dropped on my spirit, He was ordained for the slaughter (1 Peter 1:19,20).",121.,"When I have considered also the truth of his resurrection, and have remembered that word, ""Touch me not, Mary,"" &c., I have seen as if he leaped at the grave's mouth for joy that he was risen again, and had got the conquest over our dreadful foes (John 20:17).","I have also, in the spirit, seen him a man on the right hand of God the Father for me, and have seen the manner of his coming from heaven to judge the world with glory, and have been confirmed in these things by these scriptures following, Acts 1:9, 10, 7:56, 10:42; Hebrews 7:24, 8:3; Revelation 1:18; 1 Thessalonians 4:17, 18.",122.,"Once I was much troubled to know whether the Lord Jesus was both man as well as God, and God as well as man; and truly, in those days, let men say what they would, unless I had it with evidence from heaven, all was as nothing to me, I counted not myself set down in any truth of God.","Well, I was much troubled about this point, and could not tell how to be resolved; at last, that in the fifth of the Revelation came into my mind, ""And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb.""","In the midst of the throne, 'thought I,' there is his Godhead; in the midst of the elders, there is his manhood; but oh!",methought this did glister!,"it was a goodly touch, and gave me sweet satisfaction.","That other scripture also did help me much in this, ""To us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace,"" &c. (Isa 9:6).",123.,"Also, besides these teachings of God in his Word, the Lord made use of two things to confirm me in these things; the one was the errors of the Quakers, and the other was the guilt of sin; for as the Quakers did oppose his truth, so God did the more confirm me in it, by leading me into the scriptures that did wonderfully maintain it.",[31] 124.,"'The errors that this people then maintained were, 1.",That the holy Scriptures were not the Word of God.,2.,"That every man in the world had the spirit of Christ, grace, faith, &c. 3.","That Christ Jesus, as crucified, and dying 1600 years ago, did not satisfy divine justice for the sins of the people.",4.,That Christ's flesh and blood was within the saints.,5.,That the bodies of the good and bad that are buried in the churchyard shall not arise again.,6.,That the resurrection is past with good men already.,7.,"That that man Jesus, that was crucified between two thieves on Mount Calvary, in the land of Canaan, by Jerusalem, was not ascended up above the starry heavens.",8.,"That he should not, even the same Jesus that died by the hands of the Jews, come again at the last day, and as man judge all nations, &c.' 125.","'Many more vile and abominable things were in those days fomented by them, by which I was driven to a more narrow search of the Scriptures, and was, through their light and testimony, not only enlightened, but greatly confirmed and comforted in the truth'; and, as I said, the guilt of sin did help me much, for still as that would come upon me, the blood of Christ did take it off again, and again, and again, and that too, sweetly, according to the Scriptures.",O friends!,cry to God to reveal Jesus Christ unto you; there is none teacheth like him.,126.,"It would be too long for me here to stay, to tell you in particular how God did set me down in all the things of Christ, and how he did, that he might so do, lead me into his words; yea, and also how he did open them unto me, make them shine before me, and cause them to dwell with me, talk with me, and comfort me over and over, both of his own being, and the being of his Son, and Spirit, and Word, and gospel.",127.,"Only this, as I said before I will say unto you again, that in general he was pleased to take this course with me; first, to suffer me to be afflicted with temptation concerning them, and then reveal them to me: as sometimes I should lie under great guilt for sin, even crushed to the ground therewith, and then the Lord would show me the death of Christ; yea, and so sprinkle my conscience with his blood, that I should find, and that before I was aware, that in that conscience where but just now did reign and rage the law, even there would rest and abide the peace and love of God through Christ.",128.,"Now had I an evidence, 'as I thought, of my salvation' from heaven, with many golden seals thereon, all hanging in my sight; now could I remember this manifestation and the other discovery of grace, with comfort; and should often long and desire that the last day were come, that I might for ever be inflamed with the sight, and joy, and communion with him whose head was crowned with thorns, whose face was spit on, and body broken, and soul made an offering for my sins: for whereas, before, I lay continually trembling at the mouth of hell, now methought I was got so far therefrom that I could not, when I looked back, scarce discern it; and, oh!","thought I, that I were fourscore years old now, that I might die quickly, that my soul might be gone to rest.",[32] 129.,"'But before I had got thus far out of these my temptations, I did greatly long to see some ancient godly man's experience, who had writ some hundreds of years before I was born; for those who had writ in our days, I thought, but I desire them now to pardon me, that they had writ only that which others felt, or else had, through the strength of their wits and parts, studied to answer such objections as they perceived others were perplexed with, without going down themselves into the deep.","Well, after many such longings in my mind, the God in whose hands are all our days and ways, did cast into my hand, one day, a book of Martin Luther; it was his comment on the Galatians--it also was so old that it was ready to fall piece from piece if I did but turn it over.","Now I was pleased much that such an old book had fallen into my hands; the which, when I had but a little way perused, I found my condition, in his experience, so largely and profoundly handled, as if his book had been written out of my heart.","This made me marvel; for thus thought I, This man could not know anything of the state of Christians now, but must needs write and speak the experience of former days.'",130.,"'Besides, he doth most gravely, also, in that book, debate of the rise of these temptations, namely, blasphemy, desperation, and the like; showing that the law of Moses as well as the devil, death, and hell hath a very great hand therein, the which, at first, was very strange to me; but considering and watching, I found it so indeed.","But of particulars here I intend nothing; only this, methinks, I must let fall before all men, I do prefer this book of Martin Luther upon the Galatians, excepting the Holy Bible, before all the books that ever I have seen, as most fit for a wounded conscience.'",131.,"'And now I found, as I thought, that I loved Christ dearly; oh!","methought my soul cleaved unto him, my affections cleaved unto him.","I felt love to him as hot as fire; and now, as Job said, I thought I should die in my nest; but I did quickly find that my great love was but little, and that I, who had, as I thought, such burning love to Jesus Christ, could let him go again for a very trifle; God can tell how to abase us, and can hide pride from man.",Quickly after this my love was tried to purpose.',132.,"For after the Lord had, in this manner, thus graciously delivered me from this great and sore temptation, and had set me down so sweetly in the faith of his holy gospel, and had given me such strong consolation and blessed evidence from heaven touching my interest in his love through Christ; the tempter came upon me again, and that with a more grievous and dreadful temptation than before.",133.,"And that was, To sell and part with this most blessed Christ, to exchange him for the things of this life, for anything.","The temptation lay upon me for the space of a year, and did follow me so continually that I was not rid of it one day in a month, no, not sometimes one hour in many days together, unless 'when' I was asleep.",134.,"And though, in my judgment, I was persuaded that those who were once effectually in Christ, as I hoped, through his grace, I had seen myself, could never lose him for ever--for ""the land shall not be sold for ever, for the land is mine,"" saith God (Lev 25:23)[33]--yet it was a continual vexation to me to think that I should have so much as one such thought within me against a Christ, a Jesus, that had done for me as he had done; 'and yet then I had almost none others, but such blasphemous ones.'",135.,"But it was neither my dislike of the thought, nor yet any desire and endeavour to resist it that in the least did shake or abate the continuation, or force and strength thereof; for it did always, in almost whatever I thought, intermix itself therewith in such sort that I could neither eat my food, stoop for a pin, chop a stick, or cast mine eye to look on this or that, but still the temptation would come, Sell Christ for this, or sell Christ for that; 'sell him, sell him.'",136.,"Sometimes it would run in my thoughts, not so little as a hundred times together, Sell him, sell him, sell him; against which I may say, for whole hours together, I have been forced to stand as continually leaning and forcing my spirit against it, least haply, before I were aware, some wicked thought might arise in my heart that might consent thereto; and sometimes also the tempter would make me believe I had consented to it, then should I be as tortured upon a rack for whole days together.",137.,"This temptation did put me to such scares, lest I should and some times, I say, consent thereto, and be overcome therewith, that by the very force of my mind, in labouring to gainsay and resist this wickedness, my very body also would be put into action or motion by way of pushing or thrusting 'with my hands or elbows,' still answering as fast as the destroyer said, Sell him; I will not, I will not, I will not, I will not; no, not for thousands, thousands, thousands of worlds.","Thus reckoning lest I should in the midst of these assaults, set too low a value of him, even until I scarce well knew where I was, or how to be composed began.",138.,"'At these seasons he would not let me eat my food at quiet; but, forsooth, when I was set at table at my meat, I must go hence to pray; I must leave my food now, and just now, so counterfeit holy also would this devil be.","When I was thus tempted, I should say in myself, Now I am at my meat, let me make an end.","No, said he, you must do it now, or you will displease God, and despised Christ.","Wherefore I was much afflicted with these things; and because of the sinfulness of my nature, imagining that these things were impulses from God, I should deny to do it, as if I denied God; and then should I be as guilty, because I did not obey a temptation of the devil, as if I had broken the law of God indeed.'",139.,"But to be brief, one morning, as I did lie in my bed, I was, as at other times, most fiercely assaulted with this temptation, to sell and part with Christ; the wicked suggestion still running in my mind, sell him, sell him, sell him, sell him, 'sell him,' as fast as a man could speak; against which also, in my mind, as and other times, I answered, No, no, not for thousands, thousands, thousands, at least twenty times together.","But at last, after much striving, even until I was almost out of breath, I felt this thought pass through my heart, Let him go, if he will!","and I thought also, that I felt my heart 'freely' consent thereto.","'Oh, the diligence of Satan!","[34] Oh, the desperateness of man's heart!'",140.,"Now was the battle won, and down fell I, as a bird that is shot from the top of a tree, into great guilt, and fearful despair.","Thus getting out of my bed, I went moping into the field; but God knows, with as heavy a heart as mortal man, I think, could bear; where, for the space of two hours, I was like a man bereft of life, and as now past all recovery, and bound over to eternal punishment.",141.,"And withal, that scripture did seize upon my soul, ""Or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat, sold his birthright; for ye know, how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, so he sought it carefully with tears"" (Heb 12:16,17).",142.,"'Now was I as one bound, I felt myself shut out unto the judgment to come; nothing now for two years together would abide with me, but damnation, and an expectation of damnation; I say, nothing now would abide with me but this, save some few moments for relief, as in the sequel you will see.'",143.,"These words were to my soul like fetters of brass to my legs, in the continual sound of which I went for several months together.","But about ten or eleven o'clock one day, as I was walking under a hedge, full of sorrow in guilt, God knows, and bemoaning myself for this hard hap, that such a thought should arise within me; suddenly this sentence bolted in upon me, The blood of Christ remits all guilt.","At this I made a stand in my spirit; with that, this word took hold upon me, begin, ""The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin"" (1 John 1:7).",144.,"Now I began to conceive peace in my soul, in methought I saw as if the tempter did leer[35] and steal away from me, as being ashamed of what he had done.","At the same time also I had my sin, and the blood of Christ thus represented to me, that my sin, when compared to the blood of Christ, was no more to it, then this little clot or stone before me, is to this vast and wide field that here I see.","This gave me good encouragement for the space of two or three hours; in which time also, methought I saw, by faith, the Son of God, as suffering for my sins; but because it tarried not, I therefore sunk in my spirit, under exceeding guilt again.",145.,"'But chiefly by the afore-mentioned scripture, concerning Esau's selling of his birthright; for that scripture would lie all day long, all the week long, yea, all the year long in my mind, and hold me down, so that I could by no means lift up myself; for when I would strive to turn me to this scripture, or that, for relief, still that sentence would be sounding in me, ""For ye know, how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing-he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.""'",146.,"Sometimes also, [36] I should have a touch from that in Luke 22:32, ""I have prayed for the, that thy faith fail not""; but it would not abide upon me; neither could I indeed, when I considered my state, find ground to conceive in the least, that there should be the root of that grace within me, having sinned as I had done.","Now was I tore and rent in heavy case, for many days together.",147.,"Then began I with sad and careful heart, to consider of the nature and largeness of my sin, and to search in the Word of God, if I could in any place espy a word of promise, or any encouraging sentence by which I might take relief.","Wherefore I began to consider that third of Mark, All manner of sins and blasphemies shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, wherewith soever they shall blaspheme.","Which place, methought, at a blush, did contain a large and glorious promise, for the pardon of high offences; but considering the place more fully, I thought it was rather to be understood as relating more chiefly to those who had, while in a natural estate, committed such things as there are mentioned; but not to me, who had not only received light and mercy, but that had, both after, and also contrary to that, so slighted Christ as I had done.",148.,"I feared therefore that this wicked sin of mine, might be that sin unpardonable, of which he there thus speaketh.","""But he they shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation"" (Mark 3:29).","And I did the rather give credit to this, because of that sentence in the Hebrews common ""For ye know, how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.""",'And this stuck always with me.',149.,"'And now was I both the burden and a terror to myself, nor did I ever so know, as now, what it was to be weary of my life, and yet afraid to die.","Oh, how gladly now would I have been anybody but myself!",Anything but a man!,and in any condition but mine own!,"for there was nothing did pass more frequently over my mind, than that it was impossible for me to be forgiven my transgression, and to be saved from wrath to come.'",150.,"And now began I to labour to call again time that was past; wishing a thousand times twice told, that the day was yet to come, when I should be tempted to such a sin!","concluding with great indignation, both against my heart, and all assaults, how I would rather have been torn in pieces, than found a consenter thereto.","But, alas!","these thoughts, and wishings, and resolvings, were now too late to help me; the thought had passed my heart, God hath let me go, and I am fallen.",Oh!,"thought I, ""that it was with me as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me!""",[Job 29:2] 151.,"Then again, being loath and unwilling to perish, I began to compare my sin with others, to see if I could find that any of those that were saved had done as I had done.","So I considered David's adultery and murder, and found them most heinous crimes; and those too committed after light and grace received; but yet but considering, I perceived that his transgressions were only such as were against the law of Moses; from which the Lord Christ could, with the consent of his Word, deliver him: but mine was against the gospel; yea, against the Mediator thereof; 'I had sold my Saviour.'",152.,"Now again should I be as if racked upon the wheel,[37] when I considered, that, besides the guilt that possessed me, I should be so void of grace, so bewitched.","What, thought I, must it be no sin but this?",Must it needs be the great transgression?,(Psa 19:13) Must that wicked one touch my soul?,"(1 John 5:18) Oh, what stings did I find in all these sentences!",153.,"'What, thought I, is there but one sin that is unpardonable?",But one sin that layeth the soul without the reach of God's mercy; and must I be guilty of that?,Must it needs be that?,"Is there but one sin among so many millions of sins, for which there is no forgiveness; and must I commit this?","Oh, unhappy sin!","Oh, unhappy man!","These things would so break and confound my spirit, that I could not tell what to do; I thought, at times, they would have broke my wits; and still, to aggravate my misery, that would run in my mind, ""Ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected.""",Oh!,none knows the terrors of those days but myself.',154.,"After this I came to consider of Peter's sin, which he committed in denying his master; and indeed, this came nighest to mine, of any that I could find; for he had denied his Saviour, as I, and that after light and mercy received; yea, and that too, after warning given him.","I also considered, that he did both once and twice; and that, after time to consider betwixt.","But though I put all these circumstances together, that, if possible, I might find help, yet I considered again, that his was but a denial of his master, but mine was a selling of my Saviour.","Wherefore I thought with myself, that I came nearer to Judas, than either to David or Peter.",155.,"Here again my torment would flame out and afflicte me; yea, it would grind me, as it were, to powder, to discern the preservation of God towards others, while I fell into the snare; for in my thus considering of other men's sins, and comparing of them with my own, I could evidently see how God preserved them, notwithstanding their wickedness, and would not let them, as he had let me, to become a son of perdition.",156.,"But oh, how did my soul, at this time, prize the preservation that God did set about his people!","Ah, how safely did I see them walk, whom God had hedge in!","They were within his care, protection, and special providence; though they were full as bad as I by nature; yet because he loved them, he would not suffer them to fall without the range of mercy; but as for me, I was gone, I had done it; he would not preserve me, nor keep me; but suffered me, because I was a reprobate, to fall as I had done.","Now, did those blessed places, that spake of God's keeping his people, shine like the sun before me, though not to comfort me, but to show me the blessed state and heritage of those whom the Lord had blessed.",157.,"'Now I saw, that as God had his hand in all providences and dispensations that overtook his elect, so he had his hand in all the temptations that they had to sin against him, not to animate them unto wickedness, but to choose their temptations and troubles for them; and also to leave them, for a time, to such sins only as might not destroy, but humble them; as might not put them beyond, but lay them in the way off the renewing of his mercy.","But oh, what love, what care, what kindness and mercy did I now see, mixing itself with the most severe and dreadful of all God's ways to his people!","He would let David, Hezekiah, Solomon, Peter, and others fall, but he would not let them fall into sin unpardonable, nor into hell for sin.",Oh!,"thought I, these be the men that God hath loved; these be the men that God, though he chastiseth them, keeps them in safety by him, and them whom he makes to abide under the shadow of the Almighty.","But all these thoughts added sorrow, grief, and horror to me, as whatever I now thought on, it was killing to me.","If I thought how God kept his own, that was killing to me.","If I thought of how I was falling myself, that was killing to me.","As all things wrought together for the best, and to do good to them that were the called, according to his purpose; so I thought that all things wrought for my damage, and for my eternal overthrow.'",158.,"Then, again, I began to compare my sin with the sin of Judas, that, if possible, I might find that mine differed from that which, in truth, is unpardonable.","And, oh!","thought I, if it 'should differ from it,' though but the breadth of an hair, what a happy condition is my soul in!","And, by considering, I found that Judas did his intentionally, but mine was against my 'prayer and' strivings; besides, his was committed with much deliberation, but mine in a fearful hurry, on a sudden; 'all this while' I was tossed to and fro, like the locusts, and driven from trouble to sorrow; hearing always the sound of Esau's fall in mine ears, and of the dreadful consequences thereof.",159.,"Yet this consideration about Judas, his sin was, for a while, some little relief unto me; for I saw I had not, as to the circumstances, transgressed so foully as he.","But this was quickly gone again, for, I thought with myself, there might be more ways than one to commit the unpardonable sin; 'also I thought' that there might be degrees of that, as well as of other transgressions; wherefore, for ought I yet could perceive, this iniquity of mine might be such, as might never be passed by.",160.,"'I was often now ashamed, that I should be like such an ugly man as Judas; I thought, also, how loathsome I should be unto all the saints at the day of judgment; insomuch, that now I could scarce see a good man, that I believed had a good conscience, but I should feel my heart tremble at him, while I was in his presence.",Oh!,"now I saw a glory in walking with God, and what a mercy it was to have a good conscience before him.'",161.,"'I was much about this time tempted to content myself, by receiving some false opinion; as that there should be no such thing as a day of judgment, that we should not rise again, and that sin was no such grievous thing; the tempter suggesting thus, For if these things should indeed be true, yet to believe otherwise, would yield you ease for the present.","If you must perish, never torment yourself so much before hand; drive the thoughts of damning out of your mind, by possessing your mind with some such conclusions that Atheists and Ranters do use to help themselves withal.'",162.,"'But, oh!","when such thoughts have led through my heart, how, as it were, within a step, hath death and judgment been in my view!","Methought the judge stood at the door, I was as if it was come already; so that such things could have no entertainment.","But, methinks, I see by this, that Satan will use any means to keep the soul from Christ; he loveth not an awakened frame of spirit; security, blindness, darkness, and error is the very kingdom and habitation of the wicked one.'",163.,"'I found it hard work now to pray to God, because despair was swallowing me up; I thought I was, as with a tempest, driven away from God, for always when I cried to God for mercy, this would come in, It is too late, I am lost, God hath let me fall; not to my correction, but condemnation; my sin is unpardonable; and I know, concerning Esau, how that, after he had sold his birthright, he would have received the blessing, but was rejected.","About this time, I did light on that dreadful story of that miserable mortal, Francis Spira;[38] a book that was to my troubled spirit as salt, when rubbed into a fresh wound; every sentence in that book, every groan of that man, with all the rest of his actions in his dolours, as his tears, his prayers, his gnashing of teeth, his wringing of hands, his twining and twisting, languishing and pining away under that mighty hand of God that was upon him, was as knives and daggers in my soul; especially that sentence of his was frightful to me, Man knows the beginning of sin, but who bounds the issues thereof?","Then would the former sentence, as the conclusion of all, fall like a hot thunderbolt again upon my conscience; ""for you know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.""'",164.,"Then was I struck into a very great trembling, insomuch that at sometimes I could, for whole days together, feel my very body, as well as my mind, to shake and totter under the sense of the dreadful judgment of God, that should fall on those that have sinned that most fearful and unpardonable sin.","I felt also such a clogging and heat at my stomach, by reason of this my terror, that I was, especially at some times, as if my breast bone would have split in sunder; then I thought of that concerning Judas, who, by his falling headlong, burst asunder, and all his bowels gushed out (Acts 1:18).",165.,"I feared also that this was the mark that the Lord did set on Cain, even continual fear and trembling, under the heavy load of guilt that he had charged on him for the blood of his brother Abel.","Thus did I wind, and twine, and shrink, under the burden that was upon me; which burden also did so oppress me, that I could neither stand, nor go, nor lie, either at rest or quiet.",166.,"Yet that saying would sometimes come to my mind, He hath received gifts for the rebellious (Psa 68:18).","""The rebellious,"" thought I; why, surely they are such as once were under subjection to their prince, even those who, after they have sworn subjection to his government, have taken up arms against him; 'and this, thought I, is my very condition; once I loved him, feared him, served him; but now I am a rebel; I have sold him, I have said, Let him go if he will; but yet he has gifts for rebels, and then why not for me?'",167.,"This sometimes I thought on, and should labour to take hold thereof, that some, though small, refreshment might have been conceived by me; but in this also I missed of my desire, I was driven with force beyond it, 'I was' like a man that is going to the place of execution, even by that place where he would fain creep in and hide himself, but may not.",168.,"Again, after I had thus considered the sins of the saints in particular, and found mine went beyond them, then I began to think thus with myself: Set the case I should put all theirs together, and mine alone against them, might I not then find some encouragement?","For if mine, though bigger than any one, yet should but be equal to all, then there is hopes; for that blood that hath virtue enough 'in it' to wash away all theirs, hath also virtue enough in it to do away mine, though this one be full as big, if no bigger, than all theirs.","Here, again, I should consider the sin of David, of Solomon, of Manasseh, of Peter, and the rest of the great offenders; and should also labour, what I might with fairness, to aggravate and heighten their sins by several circumstances: but, alas!",It was all in vain.,[39] 169.,"'I should think with myself that David shed blood to cover his adultery, and that by the sword of the children of Ammon; a work that could not be done but by continuance and deliberate contrivance, which was a great aggravation to his sin.",But then this would turn upon me: Ah!,"but these were but sins against the law, from which there was a Jesus sent to save them; but yours is a sin against the Saviour, and who shall save you from that?'",170.,"'Then I thought on Solomon, and how he sinned in loving strange women, in falling away to their idols, in building them temples, in doing this after light, in his old age, after great mercy received; but the same conclusion that cut me off in the former consideration, cut me off as to this; namely, that all those were but sins against the law, for which God had provided a remedy; but I had sold my Saviour, and there now remained no more sacrifice for sin.'",171.,"'I would then add to those men's sins, the sins of Manasseh, how that he built altars for idols in the house of the Lord; he also observed times, used enchantment, had to do with wizards, was a wizard, had his familiar spirits, burned his children in the fire in sacrifice to devils, and made the streets of Jerusalem run down with the blood of innocents.","These, thought I, are great sins, sins of a bloody colour; yea, it would turn again upon me: They are none of them of the nature of yours; you have parted with Jesus, you have sold your Saviour.'",172.,"This one consideration would always kill my heart, My sin was point blank against my Saviour; and that too, at that height, that I had in my heart said of him, Let him go if he will.",Oh!,"methought, this sin was bigger than the sins of a country, of a kingdom, or of the whole world, no one pardonable, nor all of them together, was able to equal mine; mine outwent them every one.",173.,"Now I should find my mind to flee from God, as from the face of a dreadful judge; yet this was my torment, I could not escape his hand: ""It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God"" (Heb 10:31).","But blessed be his grace, that scripture, in these flying sins,[40] would call as running after me, ""I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions; and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me, for I have redeemed thee"" (Isa 44:22).","This, I say, would come in upon my mind, when I was fleeing from the face of God; for I did flee from his face, that is, my mind and spirit fled before him; by reason of his highness, I could not endure; then would the text cry, ""Return unto me""; it would cry aloud with a very great voice, ""Return unto me, for I have redeemed thee.""","Indeed, this would make me make a little stop, and, as it were, look over my shoulder behind me, to see if I could discern that the God of grace did follow me with a pardon in his hand, but I could no sooner do that, but all would be clouded and darkened again by that sentence, ""For you know how that afterwards, when he would have inherited the blessing, he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.""","Wherefore I could not return, but fled, though at sometimes it cried, ""Return, return,"" as if it did holloa after me.","But I feared to close in therewith, lest it should not come from God; for that other, as I said, was still sounding in my conscience, ""For you know how that afterwards, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected,"" &c. 174.","'Once as I was walking to and fro in a good man's shop, bemoaning of myself in my sad and doleful state, afflicting myself with self-abhorrence for this wicked and ungodly thought; lamenting, also, this hard hap of mine, for that I should commit so great a sin, greatly fearing I should not be pardoned; praying, also, in my heart, that if this sin of mine did differ from that against the Holy Ghost, the Lord would show it me.","And being now ready to sink with fear, suddenly there was, as if there had rushed in at the window, the noise of wind upon me, but very pleasant, and as if I heard a voice speaking, Didst ever refuse to be justified by the blood of Christ?","And, withal my whole life and profession past was, in a moment, opened to me, wherein I was made to see that designedly I had not; so my heart answered groaningly, No.","then fell, with power, that word of God upon me, ""See that ye refuse not him that speaketh"" (Heb 12:25).","This made a strange seizure upon my spirit; it brought light with it, and commanded a silence in my heart of all those tumultuous thoughts that before did use, like masterless hell-hounds, to roar and bellow, and make a hideous noise within me.","It showed me, also, that Jesus Christ had yet a word of grace and mercy for me, that he had not, as I had feared, quite forsaken and cast off my soul; yea, this was a kind of a chide for my proneness to desperation; a kind of a threatening me if I did not, notwithstanding my sins and the heinousness of them, venture my salvation upon the Son of God.","But as to my determining about this strange dispensation, what it was I knew not; or from whence it came I know not.","I have not yet, in twenty years' time, been able to make a judgment of it; I thought then what here I shall be loath to speak.","But verily, that sudden rushing wind was as if an angel had come upon me; but both it and the salvation I will leave until the day of judgment; only this I say, it commanded a great calm in my soul, it persuaded me there might be hope; it showed me, as I thought, what the sin unpardonable was, and that my soul had yet the blessed privilege to flee to Jesus Christ for mercy.","But, I say, concerning this dispensation, I know not what yet to say unto it; which was, also, in truth, the cause that, at first, I did not speak of it in the book; I do now, also, leave it to be thought on by men of sound judgment.","I lay not the stress of my salvation thereupon, but upon the Lord Jesus, in the promise; yet, seeing I am here unfolding of my secret things, I thought it might not be altogether inexpedient to let this also show itself, though I cannot now relate the matter as there I did experience it.","This lasted, in the savour of it, for about three or four days, and the I began to mistrust and to despair again.",'[41] 175.,"'Wherefore, still my life hung in doubt before me, not knowing which way I should tip; only this I found my soul desire, even to cast itself at the foot of grace, by prayer and supplication.","But, oh!","it was hard for me now to bear the face to pray to this Christ for mercy, against whom I had thus most vilely sinned; it was hard work, I say, to offer to look him in the face against whom I had so vilely sinned; and, indeed, I have found it as difficult to come to God by prayer, after backsliding from him, as to do any other thing.","Oh, the shame that did now attend me!",especially when I thought I am now a-going to pray to him for mercy that I had so lightly esteemed but a while before!,"I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because this villany had been committed by me; but I saw there was but one way with me, I must go to him and humble myself unto him, and beg that he, of his wonderful mercy, would show pity to me, and have mercy upon my wretched sinful soul.'",176.,"'Which, when the tempter perceived, he strongly suggested to me, That I ought not to pray to God; for prayer was not for any in my case, neither could it do me good, because I had rejected the Mediator, by whom all prayer came with acceptance to God the Father, and without whom no prayer could come into his presence.","Wherefore, now to pray is but to add sin to sin; yea, now to pray, seeing God has cast you off, is the next way to anger and offend him more than you ever did before.'",177.,"'For God, saith he, hath been weary of you for these several years already, because you are none of his; your bawlings in his ears hath been no pleasant voice to him; and, therefore, he let you sin this sin, that you might be quite cut off; and will you pray still?","This the devil urged, and set forth that, in Numbers, when Moses said to the children of Israel, That because they would not go up to posses the land when God would have them, therefore, for ever after, God did bar them out from thence, though they prayed they might, with tears (Num 14:36,37), &c.' 178.","'As it is said in another place (Exo 21:14), the man that sins presumptuously shall be taken from God's altar, that he may die; even as Joab was by King Solomon, when he thought to find shelter there (1 Kings 2:28), &c. These places did pinch me very sore; yet, my case being desperate, I thought with myself I can but die; and if it must be so, it shall once be said, that such an one died at the foot of Christ in prayer.","[42] This I did, but with great difficulty, God doth know; and that because, together with this, still that saying about Esau would be set at my heart, even like a flaming sword, to keep the way of the tree of life, lest I should taste thereof and live.",Oh!,who knows how hard a thing I found it to come to God in prayer.',179.,"'I did also desire the prayers of the people of God for me, but I feared that God would give them no heart to do it; yea, I trembled in my soul to think that some or other of them would shortly tell me, that God had said those words to them that he once did say to the prophet concerning the children of Israel, ""Pray not thou for this people,"" for I have rejected them (Jer 11:14).","So, pray not for him, for I have rejected him.","Yea, I thought that he had whispered this to some of them already, only they durst not tell me so, neither durst I ask them of it, for fear, if it should be so, it would make me quite besides myself.","Man knows the beginning of sin, said Spira, but who bounds the issues thereof?'",180.,"About this time I took an opportunity to break my mind to an ancient Christian, and told him all my case; I told him, also, that I was afraid that I had sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost; and he told me he thought so too.","Here, therefore, I had but cold comfort; but, talking a little more with him, I found him, though a good man, a stranger to much combat with the devil.","Wherefore, I went to God again, as well as I could, for mercy still.",181.,"Now, also, did the tempter begin to mock me in my misery, saying, that, seeing I had thus parted with the Lord Jesus, and provoked him to displeasure, who would have stood between my soul and the flame of devouring fire, there was now but one way, and that was, to pray that God the Father would be the Mediator betwixt his Son and me, that we might be reconciled again, and that I might have that blessed benefit in him that his blessed saints enjoyed.",182.,"Then did that scripture seize upon my soul, He is of one mind, and who can turn him?",Oh!,"I saw it was as easy to persuade him to make a new world, a new covenant, or new Bible, besides that we have already, as to pray for such a thing.","This was to persuade him that what he had done already was mere folly, and persuade with him to alter, yea, to disannul, the whole way of salvation; and then would that saying rend my soul asunder, ""Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven, given among men, whereby we must be saved"" (Acts 4:12).",183.,"'Now, the most free, and full, and gracious words of the gospel were the greatest torment to me; yea, nothing so afflicted me as the thoughts of Jesus Christ, the remembrance of a Saviour; because I had cast him off, brought forth the villany of my sin, and my loss by it to mind; nothing did twinge my conscience like this.","Every time that I thought of the Lord Jesus, of his grace, love, goodness, kindness, gentleness, meekness, death, blood, promises and blessed exhortations, comforts and consolations, it went to my soul like a sword; for still, unto these my considerations of the Lord Jesus, these thoughts would make place for themselves in my heart; aye, this is the Jesus, the loving Saviour, the Son of God, whom thou hast parted with, whom you slighted, despised, and abused.","This is the only Saviour, the only Redeemer, the only one that could so love sinners as to wash them from their sins in his own most precious blood; but you have no part nor lot in this Jesus, you have put him from you, you have said in your heart, Let him go if he will.","Now, therefore, you are severed from him; you have severed yourself from him.","Behold, then, his goodness, but yourself to be no partaker of it.","Oh, thought I, what have I lost!",What have I parted with!,What have I disinherited my poor soul of!,Oh!,"it is sad to be destroyed by the grace and mercy of God; to have the Lamb, the Saviour, turn lion and destroyer (Rev 6).","[43] I also trembled, as I have said, at the sight of the saints of God, especially at those that greatly loved him, and that made it their business to walk continually with him in this world; for they did, both in their words, their carriages, and all their expressions of tenderness and fear to sin against their precious Saviour, condemn, lay guilt upon, and also add continual affliction and shame unto my soul.","The dread of them was upon me, and I trembled at God's Samuels (1 Sam 16:4).'",184.,"Now, also, the tempter began afresh to mock my soul another way, saying that Christ, indeed, did pity my case, and was sorry for my loss; but forasmuch as I had sinned and transgressed, as I had done, he could by no means help me, nor save me from what I feared; for my sin was not of the nature of theirs for whom he bled and died, neither was it counted with those that were laid to his charge when he hanged on the tree.","Therefore, unless he should come down from heaven and die anew for this sin, though, indeed, he did greatly pity me, yet I could have no benefit of him.","These things may seem ridiculous to others, even as ridiculous as they were in themselves, but to me they were most tormenting cogitations; every of them augmented my misery, that Jesus Christ should have so much love as to pity me when he could not help me; nor did I think that the reason why he could not help me was because his merits were weak, or his grace and salvation spent on them already, but because his faithfulness to his threatening would not let him extend his mercy to me.","Besides, I thought, as I have already hinted, that my sin was not within the bounds of that pardon that was wrapped up in a promise; and if not, then I knew assuredly, that it was more easy for heaven and earth to pass away than for me to have eternal life.","So that the ground of all these fears of mine did arise from a steadfast belief that I had of the stability of the holy Word of God, and also, from my being misinformed of the nature of my sin.",185.,"But, oh!","how this would add to my affliction, to conceit that I should be guilty of such a sin for which he did not die.","These thoughts would so confound me, and imprison me, and tie me up from faith, that I knew not what to do; but, oh!","thought I, that he would come down again!",Oh!,that the work of man's redemption was yet to be done by Christ!,How would I pray him and entreat him to count and reckon this sin amongst the rest for which he died!,"But this scripture would strike me down as dead, ""Christ being raised from the death dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him"" (Rom 6:9).",[44] 186.,"Thus, by the strange and unusual assaults of the tempter, was my soul, like a broken vessel, driven as with the winds, and tossed sometimes headlong into despair, sometimes upon the covenant of works, and sometimes to wish that the new covenant, and the conditions thereof, might, so far forth as I thought myself concerned, be turned another way and changed.","But in all these I was but as those that justle against the rocks; more broken, scattered, and rent.","Oh, the unthought of imaginations, frights, fears, and terrors that are affected by a thorough application of guilt, yielded to desperation!","This is the man that hath ""his dwelling among the tombs"" with the dead; that is, always crying out and ""cutting himself with stones"" (Mark 5:2-5).","But I say, all in vain; desperation will not comfort him, the old covenant will not save him; nay, heaven and earth shall pass away before one jot or tittle of the Word and law of grace shall fall or be removed.","This I saw, this I felt, and under this I groaned; yet this advantage I got thereby, namely, a farther confirmation of the certainty of the way of salvation, and that the Scriptures were the Word of God!",Oh!,"I cannot now express what then I saw and felt of the steadiness of Jesus Christ, the rock of man's salvation; what was done could not be undone, added to, nor altered.","I saw, indeed, that sin might drive the soul beyond Christ, even the sin which is unpardonable; but woe to him that was so driven, for the Word would shut him out.",187.,"Thus was I always sinking, whatever I did think or do.","So one day I walked to a neighbouring town, and sat down upon a settle in the street, and fell into a very deep pause about the most fearful state my sin had brought me to; and, after long musing, I lifted up my head, but methought I saw as if the sun that shineth in the heavens did grudge to give light, and as if the very stones in the street, and tiles upon the houses, did bend themselves against me; methought that they all combined together to banish me out of the world; I was abhorred of them, and unfit to dwell among them, or be partaker of their benefits, because I had sinned against the Saviour.","O how happy, now, was every creature over [what] I was; for they stood fast and kept their station, but I was gone and lost.",188.,"Then breaking out in the bitterness of my soul, I said 'to myself,' with a grievous sigh, How can God comfort such a wretch as I?","I had no sooner said it but this returned upon me, as an echo doth answer a voice, This sin is not unto death.","At which I was as if I had been raised out of a grave, and cried out again, Lord, how couldest thou find out such a word as this?","for I was filled with admiration at the fitness, and, also, at the unexpectedness of the sentence, 'the fitness of the Word, the rightness of the timing of it, the power, and sweetness, and light, and glory that came with it, also, was marvelous to me to find.","I was now, for the time, out of doubt as to that about which I so much was in doubt before; my fears before were, that my sin was not pardonable, and so that I had no right to pray, to repent, &c., or that if I did, it would be of no advantage or profit to me.","But now, thought I, if this sin is not unto death, then it is pardonable; therefore, from this I have encouragement to come to God, by Christ, for mercy, to consider the promise of forgiveness as that which stands with open arms to receive me, as well as others.","This, therefore, was a great easement to my mind; to wit, that my sin was pardonable, that it was not the sin unto death (1 John 5:16,17).","None but those that know what my trouble, by their own experience, was, can tell what relief came to my soul by this consideration; it was a release to me from my former bonds, and a shelter from my former storm.","I seemed now to stand upon the same ground with other sinners, and to have as good right to the Word and prayer as any of them.",'[45] 189.,"Now, 'I say,' I was in hopes that my sin was not unpardonable, but that there might be hopes for me to obtain forgiveness.","But, oh, how Satan did now lay about him for to bring me down again!","But he could by no means do it, neither this day nor the most part of the next, for this sentence stood like a mill post at my back; yet, towards the evening of the next day, I felt this word begin to leave me and to withdraw its supportation from me, and so I returned to my old fears again, but with a great deal of grudging and peevishness, for I feared the sorrow of despair; 'nor could my faith now longer retain this word.'",190.,"But the next day, at evening, being under many fears, I went to seek the Lord; and as I prayed, I cried, 'and my soul cried' to him in these words, with strong cries:--O Lord, I beseech thee, show me that thou hast loved me with everlasting love (Jer 31:3).","I had no sooner said it but, with sweetness, this returned upon me, as an echo or sounding again, ""I have loved thee with an everlasting love.""","Now I went to bed at quiet; also, when I awaked the next morning, it was fresh upon my soul--'and I believed it.'",191.,But yet the tempter left me not; for it could not be so little as an hundred times that he that day did labour to break my peace.,Oh!,the combats and conflicts that I did then meet with as I strove to hold by this word; that of Esau would fly in my face like to lightning.,"I should be sometimes up and down twenty times in an hour, yet God did bear me up and keep my heart upon this word, from which I had also, for several days together, very much sweetness and comfortable hopes of pardon; for thus it was made out to me, I loved thee whilst thou wast committing this sin, I loved thee before, I love thee still, and I will love thee for ever.",192.,"Yet I saw my sin most barbarous, and a filthy crime, and could not but conclude, and that with great shame and astonishment, that I had horribly abused the holy Son of God; wherefore I felt my soul greatly to love and pity him, and my bowels to yearn towards him; for I saw he was still my Friend, and did reward me good for evil; yea, the love and affection that then did burn within to my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ did work, at this time, such a strong and hot desire of revengement upon myself for the abuse I had done unto him, that, to speak as then I thought, had I had a thousand gallons of blood within my veins, I could freely 'then' have spilt it all at the command and feet of this my Lord and Saviour.",193.,"And as I was thus in musing and in my studies, 'considering' how to love the Lord and to express my love to him, that saying came in upon me, ""If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?","But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared"" (Psa 130:3,4).","These were good words to me,[46] especially the latter part thereof; to wit, that there is forgiveness with the Lord, that he might be feared; that is, as then I understood it, that he might be loved and had in reverence; for it was thus made out to me, that the great God did set so high an esteem upon the love of his poor creatures, that rather than he would go without their love he would pardon their transgressions.",194.,"And now was that word fulfilled on me, and I was also refreshed by it, Then shall they be ashamed and confounded, ""and never open their mouth any more because of their shame, when I am pacified toward them for all that they have done, saith the Lord God"" (Eze 16:63).","Thus was my soul at this time, and, as I then did think, for ever, set at liberty from being again afflicted with my former guilt and amazement.",195.,"But before many weeks were over I began to despond again, fearing lest, notwithstanding all that I had enjoyed, that yet I might be deceived and destroyed at the last; for this consideration came strong into my mind, that whatever comfort and peace I thought I might have from the Word of the promise of life, yet unless there could be found in my refreshment a concurrence and agreement in the Scriptures, let me think what I will thereof, and hold it never so fast, I should find no such thing at the end; ""for the Scripture cannot be broken"" (John 10:35).",196.,"Now began my heart again to ache and fear I might meet with disappointment at the last; wherefore I began, with all seriousness, to examine my former comfort, and to consider whether one that had sinned as I have done, might with confidence trust upon the faithfulness of God, laid down in those words by which I had been comforted and on which I had leaned myself.","But now were brought those sayings to my mind, ""For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance"" (Heb 6:4-6).","""For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries"" (Heb 10:26,27).","Even ""as Esau, who, for one morsel of meat sold his birthright; for ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears"" (Heb 12:16,17).",197.,"Now was the word of the gospel forced from my soul, so that no promise or encouragement was to be found in the Bible for me; and now would that saying work upon my spirit to afflict me, ""Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy as other people"" (Hosea 9:1).","For I saw indeed there was cause of rejoicing for those that held to Jesus; but as for me, I had cut myself off by my transgressions, and left myself neither foot-hold, nor hand-hold, amongst all the stays and props in the precious word of life.",198.,"And truly I did now feel myself to sink into a gulf, as an house whose foundation is destroyed; I did liken myself, in this condition, unto the case of a child that was fallen into a mill-pit, who, though it could make some shift to scrabble and spraul in the water, yet because it could find neither hold for hand nor foot, therefore at last it must die in that condition.","So soon as this fresh assault had fastened on my soul, that scripture came into my heart, ""This is for many days"" (Dan 10:14).","And indeed I found it was so; for I could not be delivered, nor brought to peace again, until well nigh two years and an half were completely finished.","Wherefore these words, though in themselves they tended to discouragement, yet to me, who feared this condition would be eternal, they were at sometimes as an help and refreshment to me.",199.,"For, thought I, many days are not, not for ever, many days will have an end, therefore seeing I was to be afflicted, not a few, but many days, yet I was glad it was but for many days.","Thus, I say, I could recall myself sometimes, and give myself a help, for as soon as ever the words came 'into my mind' at first, I knew my trouble would be long; yet this would be but sometimes, for I could not always think on this, nor ever be helped 'by it,' though I did.",200.,"Now, while these Scriptures lay before me, and laid sin 'anew' at my door, that saying in the 18th of Luke, with others, did encourage me to prayer.","Then the tempter again laid at me very sore, suggesting, That neither the mercy of God, nor yet the blood of Christ, did at all concern me, nor could they help me for my sin; 'therefore it was in vain to pray.'","Yet, thought I, I will pray.","But, said the tempter, your sin is unpardonable.","'Well, said I, I will pray.","It is to no boot, said he.'","Yet, said I, I will pray.","So I went to prayer to God; and while I was at prayer, I uttered words to this effect, Lord, Satan tells me that neither thy mercy, nor Christ's blood, is sufficient to save my soul; Lord, shall I honour thee most, by believing thou wilt and canst?","or 'him,' by believing thou neither wilt nor canst?","Lord, I would fain honour thee, by believing thou wilt and canst.",201.,"And as I was thus before the Lord, that scripture fastened on my heart, ""O [wo]man, great is thy faith"" (Matt 15:28), even as if one had clapped me on the back, as I was on my knees before God.","Yet I was not able to believe this, 'that this was a prayer of faith,' till almost six months after; for I could not think that I had faith, or that there should be a word for me to act faith on; therefore I should still be as sticking in the jaws of desperation, and went mourning up and down 'in a sad condition,' crying, Is his mercy clean gone?",Is his mercy clean gone for ever?,"And I thought sometimes, even when I was groaning in these expressions, they did seem to make a question whether it was or no; yet I greatly feared it was.",202.,"'There was nothing now that I longed for more than to be put out of doubt, as to this thing in question; and, as I was vehemently desiring to know if there was indeed hopes for me, these words came rolling into my mind, ""Will the Lord cast off for ever?",And will he be a favourable no more?,Is his mercy clean gone for ever?,Doth his promise fail for evermore?,Hath God forgotten to be gracious?,"Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?""",(Psa 77:7-9).,"And all the while they run in my mind, methought I had this still as the answer, It is a question whether he had or no; it may be he hath not.","Yea, the interrogatory seemed to me to carry in it a sure affirmation that indeed he had not, nor would so cast off, but would be favourable; that his promise doth not fail, and that he had not forgotten to be gracious, nor would in anger shut up his tender mercy.","Something, also, there was upon my heart at the same time, which I now cannot call to mind; which, with this text, did sweeten my heart, and made me conclude that his mercy might not be quite gone, nor clean gone for ever.",'[47] 203.,"At another time, I remember I was again much under the question, Whether the blood of Christ was sufficient to save my soul?","In which doubt I continued from morning till about seven or eight at night; and at last, when I was, as it were, quite worn out with fear, lest it should not lay hold on me, these words did sound suddenly within my heart, He is able.","But methought this word ABLE was spoke so loud unto me; it showed such a great word, 'it seemed to be writ in great letters,' and gave such a justle to my fear and doubt, I mean for the time it tarried with me, which was about a day, as I never had from that all my life, either before or after that (Heb 7:25).",204.,"But one morning, when I was again at prayer, and trembling under the fear of this, that no word of God could help me, that piece of a sentence darted in upon me, ""My grace is sufficient.""","At this methought I felt some stay, as if there might be hopes.","But, oh how good a thing it is for God to send his Word!","For about a fortnight before I was looking on this very place, and then I thought it could not come near my soul with comfort, 'therefore' I threw down my book in a pet.","'Then I thought it was not large enough for me; no, not large enough'; but now, it was as if it had arms of grace so wide that it could not only enclose me, but many more besides.",205.,"By these words I was sustained, yet not without exceeding conflicts, for the space of seven or eight weeks; for my peace would be in and out, sometimes twenty times a day; comfort now, and trouble presently; peace now, and before I could go a furlong as full of fear and guilt as ever heart could hold; and this was not only now and then, but my whole seven weeks' experience; for this about the sufficiency of grace, and that of Esau's parting with his birthright, would be like a pair of scales within my mind, sometimes one end would be uppermost, and sometimes again the other; according to which would be my peace or trouble.",206.,"Therefore I still did pray to God, that he would come in with this Scripture more fully on my heart; to wit, that he would help me to apply the whole sentence, 'for as yet I could not: that he gave, I gathered; but further I could not go,' for as yet it only helped me to hope 'there might be mercy for me,' ""My grace is sufficient""; and though it came no farther, it answered my former question; to wit, that there was hope; yet, because ""for thee"" was left out, I was not contented, but prayed to God for that also.","Wherefore, one day as I was in a meeting of God's people, full of sadness and terror, for my fears again were strong upon me; and as I was now thinking my soul was never the better, but my case most sad and fearful, these words did, with great power, suddenly break in upon me, ""My grace is sufficient for thee, my grace is sufficient for thee, my grace is sufficient for thee,"" three times together; and, oh!","methought that every word as a mighty word unto me; as my, and grace, and sufficient, and for thee; they were then, and sometimes are still, far bigger than others be.",207.,"At which time my understanding was so enlightened, that I was as though I had seen the Lord Jesus look down from heaven through the tiles upon me, and direct these words unto me.","This sent me mourning home, it broke my heart, and filled me full of joy, and laid me low as the dust; only it stayed not long with me, I mean in this glory and refreshing comfort, yet it continued with me for several weeks, and did encourage me to hope.","But so soon as that powerful operation of it was taken off my heart, that other about Esau returned upon me as before; so my soul did hang as in a pair of scales again, sometimes up and sometimes down, now in peace, and anon again in terror.",208.,"Thus I went on for many weeks, sometimes comforted, and sometimes tormented; and, especially at some times, my torment would be very sore, for all those scriptures forenamed in the Hebrews, would be set before me, as the only sentences that would keep me out of heaven.","Then, again, I should begin to repent that ever that thought went through me, I should also think thus with myself, Why, how many scriptures are there against me?","There are but three or four: and cannot God miss them, and save me for all them?","Sometimes, again, I should think, Oh!","if it were not for these three or four words, now how might I be comforted?","And I could hardly forbear, at some times, but to wish them out of the book.",209.,"Then methought I should see as if both Peter, and Paul, and John, and all the writers, did look with scorn upon me, and hold me in derision; and as if they said unto me, All our words are truth, one of as much force as another.","It is not we that have cut you off, but you have cast away yourself; there is none of our sentences that you must take hold upon but these, and such as these: ""It is impossible; there remains no more sacrifice for sin"" (Heb 6).","And ""it had been better for them not to have known"" the will of God, ""than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them"" (2 Peter 2:21).","""For the Scriptures cannot be broken.","""[48] 210.","'These, as the elders of the city of refuge, I saw were to be the judges both of my case and me, while I stood, with the avenger of blood at my heels, trembling at their gate for deliverance, also with a thousand fears and mistrusts, I doubted that they would shut me out for ever (Josh 20:3,4).'",211.,"Thus was I confounded, not knowing what to do, nor how to be satisfied in this question, Whether the scriptures could agree in the salvation of my soul?","I quaked at the apostles, I knew their words were true, and that they must stand for ever.",212.,"And I remember one day, as I was in diverse frames of spirit, and considering that these frames were still according to the nature of the several scriptures that came in upon my mind; if this of grace, then was I quiet; but if that of Esau, then tormented; Lord, thought I, if both these scriptures would meet in my heart at once, I wonder which of them would get the better of me.","So methought I had a longing mind that they might come both together upon me; yea, I desired of God they might.",213.,"Well, about two or three days after, so they did indeed; they bolted both upon me at a time, and did work and struggle strangely in me for a while; at last, that about Esau's birthright began to wax weak, and withdraw, and vanish; and this about the sufficiency of grace prevailed with peace and joy.","And as I was in a muse about this thing, that scripture came home upon me, ""Mercy rejoiceth against judgment"" (James 2:13).",214.,"This was a wonderment to me; yet truly I am apt to think it was of God; for the word of the law and wrath must give place to the word of life and grace; because, though the word of condemnation be glorious, yet the word of life and salvation doth far exceed in glory (2 Cor 3:8-12; Mark 9:5-7).","Also, that Moses and Elias must both vanish, and leave Christ and his saints alone.",215.,"This scripture did also most sweetly visit my soul, ""And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out"" (John 6:37).","Oh, the comfort that I have had from this world, ""in no wise""!","as who should say, by no means, for no thing, whatever he hath done.","But Satan would greatly labour to pull this promise from me, telling of me that Christ did not mean me, and such as I, but sinners of a lower rank, that had not done as I had done.","But I should answer him again, Satan, here is in this word no such exception; but ""him that comes,"" HIM, any him; ""him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""","And this I well remember still, that of all the sleights that Satan used to take this scripture from me, yet he never did so much as put this question, But do you come aright?","And I have thought the reason was, because he thought I knew full well what coming aright was; for I saw that to come aright was to come as I was, a vile and ungodly sinner, and to cast myself at the feet of mercy, condemning myself for sin.","If ever Satan and I did strive for any word 'of God in all my life, it was for this good word of Christ; he at one end and I at the other.","Oh, what work did we make!'","It was for this in John, 'I say, that we did so tug and strive'; he pulled and I pulled; but, God be praised, 'I got the better of him,' I got some sweetness from it.",216.,"But, notwithstanding all these helps and blessed words of grace, yet that of Esau's selling of his birthright would still at times distress my conscience; for though I had been most sweetly comforted, and that but just before, yet when that came into 'my' mind, it would make me fear again, I could not be quite rid thereof, it would every day be with me: wherefore now I went another way to work, even to consider the nature of this blasphemous thought; I mean, if I should take the words at the largest, and give them their own natural force and scope, even every word therein.","So when I had thus considered, I found, that if they were fairly taken, they would amount to this, that I had freely left the Lord Jesus Christ to his choice, whether he would be my Saviour or no; for the wicked words were these, Let him go if he will.","Then that scripture gave me hope, ""I will never leave thee nor forsake thee"" (Heb 13:5).","O Lord, said I, but I have left thee.","Then it answered again, ""But I will not leave thee.""",For this I thank God also.,217.,"Yet I was grievously afraid he should, and found it exceeding hard to trust him, seeing I had so offended him.","I could have been exceeding glad that this thought had never befallen, for then I thought I could, with more ease and freedom abundance, have leaned upon his grace.","I see it was with me, as it was with Joseph's brethren; the guilt of their own wickedness did often fill them with fears that their brother would at last despise them (Gen 50:15-17).",218.,"But above all the scriptures that I yet did meet with, that in the twentieth of Joshua was the greatest comfort to me, which speaks of the slayer that was to flee for refuge.","And if the avenger of blood pursue the slayer, then, saith Moses, they that are the elders of the city of refuge shall not deliver him into his hand, because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not aforetime.","Oh, blessed be God for this word; I was convinced that I was the slayer; and that the avenger of blood pursued me, that I felt with great terror; only now it remained that I inquire whether I have right to enter the city of refuge.","[49] So I found that he must not, who lay in wait to shed blood: 'it was not the willful murderer,' but he who unwittingly did it, he who did unawares shed blood; 'not of spite, or grudge, or malice, he that shed it unwittingly,' even he who did not hate his neighbour before.","Wherefore, 219.","I thought verily I was the man that must enter, because I had smitten my neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not aforetime.","I hated him not aforetime; no, I prayed unto him, was tender of sinning against him; yea, and against this wicked temptation I had strove for a twelvemonth before; yea, and also when it did pass through my heart, it did it in spite of my teeth: wherefore I thought I had right to enter this city, and the elders, which are the apostles, were not to deliver me up.","This, therefore, was great comfort to me; and did give me much ground of hope.",220.,"Yet being very critical, for my smart had made me that I knew not what ground was sure enough to bear me, I had one question that my soul did much desire to be resolved about; and that was, Whether it be possible for any soul that hath indeed sinned the unpardonable sin, yet after that to receive though but the least true spiritual comfort from God through Christ?","The which, after I had much considered, I found the answer was, No, they could not; and that for these reasons:-- 221.","First, Because those that have sinned that sin, they are debarred a share in the blood of Christ, and being shut out of that, they must needs be void of the least ground of hope, and so of spiritual comfort; for to such ""there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins"" (Heb 10:26).","Secondly, Because they are denied a share in the promise of life; they shall never be forgiven, ""neither in this world, neither in that which is to come"" (Matt 12:32).","Thirdly, The Son of God excludes them also from a share in his blessed intercession, being for ever ashamed to own them both before his holy Father, and the blessed angels in heaven (Mark 8:38).",222.,"When I had, with much deliberation, considered of this matter, and could not but conclude that the Lord had comforted me, and that too after this my wicked sin; then, methought, I durst venture to come nigh unto those most fearful and terrible scriptures, with which all this while I had been so greatly affrighted, and on which, indeed, before I durst scarce cast mine eye, yea, had much ado an hundred times to forbear wishing of them out of the Bible; for I thought they would destroy me; but now, I say, I began to take some measure of encouragement to come close to them, to read them, and consider them, and to weigh their scope and tendency.",223.,"The which, when I began to do, I found their visage changed; for they looked not so grimly on me as before I thought they did.","And, first, I came to the sixth of the Hebrews, yet trembling for fear it should strike me; which when I had considered, I found that the falling there intended was a falling quite away; that is, as I conceived, a falling from, and an absolute denial of the gospel of remission of sins by Christ; for from them the apostle begins his argument (vv 1-3).","Secondly, I found that this falling away must be openly, even in the view of the world, even so as ""to put Christ to an open shame.""","Thirdly, I found that those he there intended were for ever shut up of God, both in blindness, hardness, and impenitency: it is impossible they should be renewed again unto repentance.","By all these particulars, I found, to God's everlasting praise, my sin was not the sin in this place intended.","'First, I confessed I was fallen, but not fallen away, that is, from the profession of faith in Jesus unto eternal life.","Secondly, I confessed that I had put Jesus Christ to shame by my sin, but not to open shame; I did not deny him before men, nor condemn him as a fruitless one before the world.","Thirdly, Nor did I find that God had shut me up, or denied me to come, though I found it hard work indeed to come to him by sorrow and repentance.",Blessed be God for unsearchable grace.',224.,"Then I considered that in the tenth of the Hebrews, and found that the willful sin there mentioned is not every willful sin, but that which doth throw off Christ, and then his commandments too.","Secondly, That must also be done openly, before two or three witnesses, to answer that of the law (v 28).","Thirdly, This sin cannot be committed, but with great despite done to the Spirit of grace; despising both the dissuasions from that sin, and the persuasions to the contrary.","But the Lord knows, though this my sin was devilish, yet it did not amount to these.",225.,"And as touching that in the twelfth of the Hebrews, about Esau's selling his birthright, though this was that which killed me, and stood like a spear against me; yet now I did consider, First, That his was not a hasty thought against the continual labour of his mind, but a thought consented to and put in practice likewise, and that too after some deliberation (Gen 25).","Secondly, It was a public and open action, even before his brother, if not before many more; this made his sin of a far more heinous nature than otherwise it would have been.","Thirdly, He continued to slight his birthright: ""He did eat and drink, and went his way; thus Esau despised his birthright"" (v 34).","Yea, twenty years after, he was found to despise it still.","""And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself"" (Gen 33:9).",226.,"Now as touching this, that Esau sought a place of repentance; thus I thought, first, This was not for the birthright, but for the blessing; this is clear from the apostle, and is distinguished by Esau himself; ""he took away my birthright [that is, formerly]; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing"" (Gen 27:36).","Secondly, Now, this being thus considered, I came again to the apostle, to see what might be the mind of God, in a New Testament style and sense, concerning Esau's sin; and so far as I could conceive, this was the mind of God, That the birthright signified regeneration, and the blessing the eternal inheritance; for so the apostle seems to hint, ""Lest there be any profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright""; as if he should say, Lest there be any person amongst you, that shall cast off all those blessed beginnings of God that at present are upon him, in order to a new birth, lest they become as Esau, even be rejected afterwards, when they would inherit the blessing.",227.,"For many there are who, in the day of grace and mercy, despise those things which are indeed the birthright to heaven, who yet, when the deciding day appears, will cry as loud as Esau, ""Lord, Lord, open to us""; but then, as Isaac would not repent, no more will God the Father, but will say, I have blessed these, yea, and they shall be blessed; but as for you, depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity (Gen 27:33; Luke 13:25-27).",228.,"When I had thus considered these scriptures, and found that thus to understand them was not against, but according to other scriptures; this still added further to my encouragement and comfort, and also gave a great blow to that objection, to wit, that the scripture could not agree in the salvation of my soul.","And now remained only the hinder part of the tempest, for the thunder was gone beyond me, only some drops did still remain, that now and then would fall upon me; but because my former frights and anguish were very sore and deep, therefore it did oft befall me still, as it befalleth those that have been scared with fire, I thought every voice was Fire, fire; every little touch would hurt my tender conscience.",[50] 229.,"But one day, as I was passing in the field, and that too with some dashes on my conscience, fearing lest yet all was not right, suddenly this sentence fell upon my soul, Thy righteousness is in heaven; and methought withal, I saw, with the eyes of my soul, Jesus Christ at God's right hand; there, I say, as my righteousness; so that wherever I was, or whatever I was adoing, God could not say of me, He wants my righteousness, for that was just before him.","I also saw, moreover, that it was not my good frame of heart that made my righteousness better, nor yet my bad frame that made my righteousness worse; for my righteousness was Jesus Christ himself, the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever (Heb 13:8).",230.,"Now did my chains fall off my legs indeed, I was loosed from my affliction and irons, my temptations also fled away; so that, from that time, those dreadful scriptures of God left off to trouble me; now went I also home rejoicing, for the grace and love of God.","So when I came home, I looked to see if I could find that sentence, Thy righteousness is in heaven; but could not find such a saying, wherefore my heart began to sink again, only that was brought to my remembrance, he ""of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption""; by this word I saw the other sentence true (1 Cor 1:30).",231.,"For by this scripture, I saw that the man Christ Jesus, as he is distinct from us, as touching his bodily presence, so he is our righteousness and sanctification before God.","Here, therefore, I lived for some time, very sweetly at peace with God through Christ; Oh methought, Christ!",Christ!,"there was nothing but Christ that was before my eyes, I was not now only for looking upon this and the other benefits of Christ apart, as of his blood, burial, or resurrection, but considered him as a whole Christ!","As he in whom all these, and all other his virtues, relations, offices, and operations met together, and that 'as he sat' on the right hand of God in heaven.",232.,"It was glorious to me to see his exaltation, and the worth and prevalency of all his benefits, and that because of this: now I could look from myself to him, and should reckon that all those graces of God that now were green in me, were yet but like those cracked groats and fourpence-halfpennies[51] that rich men carry in their purses, when their gold is in their trunks at home!","Oh, I saw my gold was in my trunk at home!","In Christ, my Lord and Saviour!","Now Christ was all; all my wisdom, all my righteousness, all my sanctification, and all my redemption.",233.,"Further, the Lord did also lead me into the mystery of union with the Son of God, that I was joined to him, that I was flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, and now was that a sweet word to me in Ephesians 5:30.","By this also was my faith in him, as my righteousness, the more confirmed to me; for if he and I were one, then his righteousness was mine, his merits mine, his victory also mine.","Now could I see myself in heaven and earth at once; in heaven by my Christ, by my head, by my righteousness and life, though on earth by my body or person.",234.,"Now I saw Christ Jesus was looked on of God, and should also be looked upon by us, as that common or public person, [52] in whom all the whole body of his elect are always to be considered and reckoned; that we fulfilled the law by him, died by him, rose from the dead by him, got the victory over sin, death, the devil, and hell, by him; when he died, we died; and so of his resurrection.","""Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise,"" saith he (Isa 26:19).","And again, ""After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight"" (Hosea 6:2); which is now fulfilled by the sitting down of the Son of man on the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens, according to that to the Ephesians, he ""hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus"" (Eph 2:6).",235.,"Ah, these blessed considerations and scriptures, with many other of a like nature, were in those days made to spangle in mine eyes, 'so that I have cause to say,' ""Praise ye the Lord.",Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.,"Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness"" (Psa 150:1,2).",236.,"Having thus, in few words, given you a taste of the sorrow and affliction that my soul went under, by the guilt and terror that this my wicked thought did lay me under!","and having given you also a touch of my deliverance therefrom, and of the sweet and blessed comfort that I met with afterwards, which comfort dwelt about a twelve-month with my heart, to my unspeakable admiration; I will now, God willing, before I proceed any further, give you in a word or two, what, as I conceive, was the cause of this temptation; and also after that, what advantage, at the last, it became unto my soul.",237.,"For the causes, I conceived they were principally two: of which two also I was deeply convinced all the time this trouble lay upon me.","The first was, for that I did not, when I was delivered from the temptation that went before, still pray to God to keep me from temptations that were to come; for though, as I can say in truth, my soul was much in prayer before this trial seized me, yet then I prayed only, or at the most, principally for the removal of present troubles, and for fresh discoveries of 'his' love in Christ!",which I saw afterwards was not enough to do; I also should have prayed that the great God would keep me from the evil that was to come.,238.,"Of this I was made deeply sensible by the prayer of holy David, who, when he was under present mercy, yet prayed that God would hold him back from sin and temptation to come; ""Then,"" saith he, ""shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the GREAT transgression"" (Psa 19:13).","By this very word was I galled and condemned, quite through this long temptation.",239.,"That also was another word that did much condemn me for my folly, in the neglect of this duty (Heb 4:16), ""Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.""","This I had not done, and therefore was suffered thus to sin and fall, according to what is written, ""Pray that ye enter not into temptation.""","And truly this very thing is to this day of such weight and awe upon me, that I dare not, when I come before the Lord, go off my knees, until I entreat him for help and mercy against the temptations that are to come; and I do beseech thee, reader, that thou learn to beware of my negligence, by the affliction that for this thing I did for days, and months, and years, with sorrow undergo.",240.,"Another cause of this temptation was, that I had tempted God; and on this manner did I do it.","Upon a time my wife was great with child, and before her full time was come, her pangs, as of a woman in travail, were fierce and strong upon her, even as if she would have immediately fallen in labour, and been delivered of an untimely birth.","Now, at this very time it was, that I had been so strongly tempted to question the being of God; wherefore, as my wife lay crying by me, I said, but with all secrecy imaginable, even thinking in my heart, Lord, if thou wilt now remove this sad affliction from my wife, and cause that she be troubled no more therewith this night, and now were her pangs just upon her, then I shall know that thou canst discern the most secret thoughts of the heart.",241.,"I had no sooner said it in my heart, but her pangs were taken from her, and she was cast into a deep sleep, and so she continued till morning; at this I greatly marveled, not knowing what to think; but after I had been awake a good while, and heard her cry no more, I fell to sleeping also.","So when I waked in the morning, it came upon me again, even what I had said in my heart the last night, and how the Lord had showed me that he knew my secret thoughts, which was a great astonishment unto me for several weeks after.",242.,"Well, about a year and a half afterwards, that wicked sinful thought, of which I have spoken before, went through my wicked heart, even this thought, Let Christ go if he will; so when I was fallen under guilt for this, the remembrance of my other thought, and of the effect thereof, would also come upon me with this retort, which also carried rebuke along with it, Now you may see that God doth know the most secret thoughts of the heart.",[53] 243.,"And with this, that of the passages that were betwixt the Lord and his servant Gideon fell upon my spirit; how because that Gideon tempted God with his fleece, both wet and dry, when he should have believed and ventured upon his word, therefore the Lord did afterwards so try him, as to send him against an innumerable company of enemies; and that too, as to outward appearance, without any strength or help (Judg 6, 7).","Thus he served me, and that justly, for I should have believed his word, and not have put an IF upon the all-seeingness of God.",244.,"And now to show you something of the advantages that I also gained by this temptation; and first, By this I was made continually to possess in my soul a very wonderful sense both of the being and glory of God, and of his beloved Son; in the temptation 'that went' before, my soul was perplexed with 'unbelief, blasphemy, hardness of heart, questions about the being of God, Christ, the truth of the Word, and certainty of the world to come; I say, then I was greatly assaulted and tormented with' atheism; but now the case was otherwise, now was God and Christ continually before my face, though not in a way of comfort, but in a way of exceeding dread and terror.","The glory of the holiness of God did at this time break me to pieces; and the bowels and compassion of Christ did break me as on the wheel;[54] for I could not consider him but as a lost and rejected Christ, the remembrance of which was as the continual breaking of my bones.",245.,"The Scriptures now also were wonderful things unto me; I saw that the truth and verity of them were the keys of the kingdom of heaven; those 'that' the Scriptures favour they must inherit bliss, but those 'that' they oppose and condemn must perish evermore.","Oh this word, ""For the Scripture cannot be broken"": would rend the caul of my heart; and so would that other, ""Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.""","Now I saw the apostles to be the elders of the city of refuge (Josh 20:4), those 'that' they were to receive in, were received to life; but those that they shut out were to be slain by the avenger of blood.",[55] 246.,Oh!,"one sentence of the Scripture did more afflict and terrify my mind, I mean those sentences that stood against me, as sometimes I thought they every one did, more I say, than an army of forty thousand men that might have come against me.",Woe be to him against whom the Scriptures bend themselves.,247.,"By this temptation I was made 'to' see more into the nature of the promises than ever I was before; for I lying now trembling under the mighty hand of God, continually torn and rent by the thunderings of his justice; this made me, with careful heart and watchful eye, with great seriousness, to turn over every leaf, and with much diligence, mixed with trembling, to consider every sentence, together with its natural force and latitude.",248.,"By this temptation, also, I was greatly beaten off my former foolish practice, of putting by the word of promise when it came into my mind; for now, though I could not suck that comfort and sweetness from the promise as I had done at other times, yea, like to a man a-sinking, I should catch at all I saw; formerly I thought I might not meddle with the promise unless I felt its comfort, but now it was no time thus to do, the avenger of blood too hardly did pursue me.",249.,"Now therefore I was glad to catch at that word, which yet I feared I had no ground or right to own; and even to leap into the bosom of that promise, that yet I feared did shut its heart against me.","Now also I should labour to take the Word as God had laid it down, without restraining the natural force of one syllable thereof.","O what did I now see in that blessed sixth of John, ""And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out"" (v 37).","Now I began to consider with myself, that God had a bigger mouth to speak with than I had heart to conceive with.","I thought also with myself that he spake not his words in haste, or in unadvised heat, but with infinite wisdom and judgment, and in very truth and faithfulness (2 Sam 3:18).",250.,"I should in these days, often in my greatest agonies, even flounce towards the promise, as the horses do towards sound ground that yet stick in the mire, concluding, though as one almost bereft of his wits through fear, on this I will rest and stay, and leave the fulfilling of it to the God of heaven that made it.",Oh!,many a pull hath my heart had with Satan for that blessed sixth of John.,"I did not now, as at other times, look principally for comfort, though, O how welcome would it have been unto me!","But now a word, a word to lean a weary soul upon, that I might not sink for ever!",'it was that I hunted for.',251.,"Yea, often when I have been making to the promise, I have seen as if the Lord would refuse my soul for ever.","I was often as if I had run upon the pikes, and as if the Lord had thrust at me to keep me from him as with a flaming sword.","Then I should think of Esther, who went to petition the king contrary to the law (Esth 4:16).","I thought also of Benhadad's servants, who went with ropes upon their heads to their enemies for mercy (1 Kings 20:31).","The woman of Canaan also, that would not be daunted, though called dog by Christ (Matt 15:20-28).","And the man that went to borrow bread at midnight (Luke 11:5-8), were great encouragements unto me.",251.,"I never saw those heights and depths in grace, and love, and mercy, as I saw after this temptation.","Great sins do draw out great grace; and where guilt is most terrible and fierce there the mercy of God in Christ, when showed to the soul, appears most high and mighty.","When Job had passed through his captivity, he had ""twice as much as he had before"" (Job 42:10).",Blessed be God for Jesus Christ our Lord.,"Many other things I might here make observation of, but I would be brief, and therefore shall at this time omit them, and do pray God that my harms may make others fear to offend, lest they also be made to bear the iron yoke as I 'did.'","'I had two or three times, at or about my deliverance from this temptation, such strange apprehensions of the grace of God, that I could hardly bear up under it, it was so out of measure amazing, when I thought it could reach me, that I do think, if that sense of it had abode long upon me, it would have made me incapable for business.'","[ENTERS INTO FELLOWSHIP WITH THE CHURCH OF CHRIST AT BEDFORD, IN WHICH HE AFTERWARDS BECAME A MINISTERING ELDER.]",253.,"Now I shall go forward to give you a relation of other of the Lord's dealings with me, of his dealings with me at sundry other seasons, and of the temptations I then did meet withal.",I shall begin with what I met with when I first did join in fellowship with the people of God in Bedford.,"[56] After I had propounded to the church that my desire was to walk in the order and ordinances of Christ with them, and was also admitted by them; while I thought of that blessed ordinance of Christ, which was his last supper with his disciples before his death, that Scripture, ""This do in remembrance of me"" (Luke 22:19), was made a very precious word unto me; for by it the Lord did come down upon my conscience with the discovery of his death for my sins; and as I then felt, did as if he plunged me in the virtue of the same.","But, behold, I had not been long a partaker at that ordinance, but such fierce and sad temptations did attend me at all times therein, both to blaspheme the ordinance, and to wish some deadly thing to those that then did eat thereof; that, lest I should at any time be guilty of consenting to these wicked and fearful thoughts, I was forced to bend myself all the while to pray to God to keep me from such blasphemies; and also to cry to God to bless the bread and cup to them as it went from mouth to mouth.","The reason of this temptation I have thought since was, because I did not, with that reverence 'as became me,' at first approach to partake thereof.",254.,"Thus I continued for three quarters of a year, and could never have rest nor ease; but at last the Lord came in upon my soul with that same scripture by which my soul was visited before; and after that I have been usually very well and comfortable in the partaking of that blessed ordinance, and have, I trust, therein discerned the Lord's body as broken for my sins, and that his precious blood hath been shed for my transgressions.",255.,"Upon a time I was somewhat inclining to a consumption, wherewith, about the spring, I was suddenly and violently seized with much weakness in my outward man, insomuch that I thought I could not live.","Now began I afresh to give myself up to a serious examination after my state and condition for the future, and of my evidences for that blessed world to come; for it hath, I bless the name of God, been my usual course, as always, so especially in the day of affliction, to endeavour to keep my interest in the life to come clear before my eye.",256.,"But I had no sooner began to recall to mind my former experience of the goodness of God to my soul, but there came flocking into my mind, an innumerable company of my sins and transgressions, amongst which these were at this time most to my affliction, namely, my deadness, dullness, and coldness in holy duties; my wanderings of heart, 'of' my wearisomeness in all good things, my want of love to God, his ways, and people, with this at the end of all, Are these the fruits of Christianity?",are these the tokens of a blessed man?,257.,"At the apprehension of these things my sickness was doubled upon me, for now was I sick in my inward man, my soul was clogged with guilt; now also was my former experience of God's goodness to me quite taken out of my mind, and hid as if it had never been, nor seen.","Now was my soul greatly pinched between these two considerations, Live I must not, Die I dare not; now I sunk and fell in my spirit, and was giving up all for lost; but as I was walking up and down in the house, as a man in a most woeful state, that word of God took hold of my heart, Ye are ""justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus"" (Rom 3:24).",'But oh what a turn it made upon me!',258.,"Now was I as one awakened out of some troublesome sleep and dream, and listening to this heavenly sentence, I was as if I had heard it thus expounded to me: Sinner, thou thinkest that because of thy sins and infirmities I cannot save thy soul, but behold my Son is by me, and upon him I look, and not on thee, and will deal with thee according as I am pleased with him.","At this I was greatly lightened in my mind, and made to understand that God could justify a sinner at any time; it was but 'his' looking upon Christ, and imputing of his benefits to us, and the work was forthwith done.",259.,"And as I was thus in a muse that scripture also came with great power upon my spirit, Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, &c. (Titus 3:5; 2 Tim 1:9).","Now was I got on high; I saw myself within the arms of grace and mercy; and though I was before afraid to think of a dying hour, yet now I cried, Let me die.",Now death was lovely and beautiful in my sight; for I saw we shall never live indeed till we be gone to the other world.,"Oh, methought this life is but a slumber in comparison of that above; at this time also I saw more in those words, ""Heirs of God"" (Rom 8:17), than ever I shall be able to express while I live in this world.","""Heirs of God!""",God himself is the portion of the saints.,"This I saw and wondered at, but cannot tell you what I saw.",[57] 260.,"'Again, as I was at another time very ill and weak, all that time also the tempter did beset me strongly, for I find he is much for assaulting the soul when it begins to approach towards the grave, then is his opportunity, labouring to hide from me my former experience of God's goodness; also setting before me the terrors of death and the judgment of God, insomuch that at this time, through my fear of miscarrying for ever, should I now die, I was as one dead before death came, and was as if I had felt myself already descending into the pit; methought, I said, there was no way, but to hell I must; but behold, just as I was in the midst of those fears, these words of the angels carrying Lazarus into Abraham's bosom darted in upon me, as who should say, So it shall be with thee when thou dost leave this world.","This did sweetly revive my spirit, and help me to hope in God; which, when I had with comfort mused on a while, that word fell with great weight upon my mind, ""O death, where is thy sting?","O grave, where is thy victory?""",(1 Cor 15:55).,"At this I became both well in body and mind at once, for my sickness did presently vanish, and I walked comfortably in my work for God again.'",261.,"At another time, though just before I was pretty well and savoury in my spirit, yet suddenly there fell upon me a great cloud of darkness, which did so hide from me the things of God and Christ, that I was as if I had never seen or known them in my life; I was also so overrun in my soul, with a senseless, heartless frame of spirit, that I could not feel my soul to move or stir after grace and life by Christ; I was as if my loins were broken, or as if my hands and feet had been tied or bound with chains.","At this time also I felt some weakness to seize 'upon' my outward man, which made still the other affliction the more heavy and uncomfortable 'to me.'",262.,"After I had been in this condition some three or four days, as I was sitting by the fire, I suddenly felt this word to sound in my heart, I must go to Jesus; at this my former darkness and atheism fled away, and the blessed things of heaven were set within my view.","While I was on this sudden thus overtaken with surprise, Wife, said I, is there ever such a scripture, I must go to Jesus?","she said she could not tell, therefore I sat musing still to see if I could remember such a place; I had not sat above two or three minutes but that came bolting in upon me, ""And to an innumerable company of angels,"" and withal, Hebrews the twelfth, about the mount Sion was set before mine eyes (vv 22-24).",263.,"Then with joy I told my wife, O now I know, I know!","But that night was a good night to me, I never had but few better; I longed for the company of some of God's people that I might have imparted unto them what God had showed me.","Christ was a precious Christ to my soul that night; I could scarce lie in my bed for joy, and peace, and triumph, through Christ; this great glory did not continue upon me until morning, yet that twelfth of the author to the Hebrews (Heb 12:22,23) was a blessed scripture to me for many days together after this.",264.,"The words are these, ""Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.""","Through this blessed sentence the Lord led me over and over, first to this word, and then to that, and showed me wonderful glory in every one of them.",These words also have oft since this time been great refreshment to my spirit.,Blessed be God for having mercy on me.,[A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR'S CALL TO THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.],265.,"And now I am speaking my experience, I will in this place thrust in a word or two concerning my preaching the Word, and of God's dealing with me in that particular also.","For after I had been about five or six years awakened, and helped 'myself' to see both the want and worth of Jesus Christ our Lord, and 'also' enabled to venture my soul upon him, some of the most able among the saints with us, I say the most able for judgment and holiness of life, as they conceived, did perceive that God had counted me worthy to understand something of his will in his holy and blessed Word, and had given me utterance, in some measure, to express what I saw to others for edification; 'therefore' they desired me, and that with much earnestness, that I would be willing, at sometimes, to take in hand, in one of the meetings, to speak a word of exhortation unto them.",[58] 266.,"The which, though at the first it did much dash and abash my spirit, yet being still by them desired and intreated, I consented to their request, and did twice at two several assemblies, but in private, though with much weakness and infirmity, discover my gift amongst them; at which they not only seemed to be, but did solemnly protest, as in the sight of the great God, they were both affected and comforted, and gave thanks to the Father of mercies for the grace bestowed on me.",267.,"After this, sometimes when some of them did go into the country to teach, they would also that I should go with them; where, though as yet I did not, nor durst not, make use of my gift in an open way, yet more privately still as I came amongst the good people in those places, I did sometimes speak a word of admonition unto them also; the which, they as the other received, with rejoicing, at the mercy of God to me-ward, professing their souls were edified thereby.",268.,"Wherefore, to be brief, at last, being still desired by the church, after some solemn prayer to the Lord, with fasting, I was more particularly called forth, and appointed to a more ordinary and public preaching the word, not only to, and amongst them that believed, but also to offer the gospel to those who had not yet received the faith thereof; about which time I did evidently find in my mind a secret pricking forward thereto; though I bless God, not for desire of vain glory, for at that time I was most sorely afflicted with the fiery darts of the devil concerning my eternal state.",269.,"But yet could not be content, unless I was found in the exercise of my gift, unto which also I was greatly animated, not only by the continual desires of the godly, but also by that saying of Paul to the Corinthians, ""I beseech you, brethren (ye know the household of Stephanus, that it is the first fruits of Achaian, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints) that ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth"" (1 Cor 16:15,16).",270.,"By this text I was made to see that the Holy Ghost never intended that men who have gifts and abilities should bury them in the earth, but rather did command and stir up such to the exercise of their gift, and also did commend those that were apt and ready so to do, ""They have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints.""","This scripture, in these days, did continually run in my mind, to encourage me and strengthen me in this my work for God; I have also been encouraged from several other scriptures and examples of the godly, both specified in the Word and other ancient histories (Acts 8:4, 18:24,25; 1 Peter 4:10; Rom 12:6; Foxe's Acts and Monuments).",271.,"Wherefore, though of myself, of all the saints the most unworthy, yet I, but with great fear and trembling at the sight of my own weakness, did set upon the work, and did according to my gift, and the proportion of my faith, preach that blessed gospel that God had showed me in the holy Word of truth; which, when the country understood, they came in to hear the Word by hundreds, and that from all parts, though upon sundry and divers accounts.",272.,"And I thank God he gave unto me some measure of bowels and pity for their souls, which also did put me forward to labour with great diligence and earnestness, to find out such a word as might, if God would bless it, lay hold of, and awaken the conscience, in which also the good Lord had respect to the desire of his servant; for I had not preached long before some began to be touched by the Word, and to be greatly afflicted in their minds at the apprehension of the greatness of their sin, and of their need of Jesus Christ.",273.,"But I at first could not believe that God should speak by me to the heart of any man, still counting myself unworthy; yet those who thus were touched would love me and have a peculiar respect for me; and though I did put it from me, that they should be awakened by me, still they would confess it and affirm it before the saints of God; they would also bless God for me, unworthy wretch that I am!",and count me God's instrument that showed to them the way of salvation.,274.,"Wherefore, seeing them in both their words and deeds to be so constant, and also in their hearts so earnestly pressing after the knowledge of Jesus Christ, rejoicing that ever God did send me where they were; then I began to conclude it might be so, that God had owned in his work such a foolish one as I, and then came that word of God to my heart with much sweet refreshment, ""The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy"" (Job 29:13).",275.,"At this therefore I rejoiced, yea, the tears of those whom God did awaken by my preaching would be both solace and encouragement to me; for I thought on those sayings, ""Who is he that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorry by me?""","(2 Cor 2;2); and again, Though ""I be not an apostle to others, yet, doubtless, I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord"" (1 Cor 9:2).","These things, therefore, were as another argument unto me that God had called me to, and stood by me in this work.",276.,"In my preaching of the Word, I took special notice of this one thing, namely, that the Lord did lead me to being where his Word begins with sinners; that is, to condemn all flesh, and to open and allege that the curse of God, by the law, doth belong to, and lay hold on all men as they come into the world, because of sin.","Now this part of my work I fulfilled with great sense;[59] for the terrors of the law, and guilt for my transgressions, lay heavy on my conscience.","I preached what I felt, what I smartingly did feel, even that under which my pour soul did groan and tremble to astonishment.",277.,Indeed I have been as one sent to them from the dead; I went myself in chains to preach to them in chains; and carried that fire in my own conscience that I persuaded them to beware of.,"I can truly say, and that without dissembling, that when I have been to preach, I have gone full of guilt and terror even to the pulpit door, and there it hath been taken off, and I have been at liberty in my mind until I have done my work, and then immediately, even before I could get down the pulpit stairs, I have been as bad as I was before; yet God carried me on, but surely with a strong hand, for neither guilt or hell could take me off my work.",278.,"Thus I went for the space of two years, crying out against men's sins, and their fearful state because of them.",After which the Lord came in upon my own soul with some staid peace and comfort through Christ; for he did give me many sweet discoveries of his blessed grace through him.,"Wherefore now I altered in my preaching, for still I preached what I saw and felt; now therefore I did much labour to hold forth Jesus Christ in all his offices, relations, and benefits unto the world; and did strive also to discover, to condemn, and remove those false supports and props on which the world doth both lean, and by them fall and perish.",On these things also I staid as long as on the other.,279.,"After this, God led me into something of the mystery of union with Christ; wherefore that I discovered and showed to them also.","And when I had traveled through these three chief points of the Word of God, about the space of five years or more, I was caught in my present practice and cast into prison, where I have lain[60] above as long again, to confirm the truth by way of suffering, as I was before in testifying of it according to the Scriptures in a way of preaching.",280.,"When I have been preaching, I thank God, my heart hath often all the time of this and the other exercise, with great earnestness, cried to God that he would make the Word effectual to the salvation of the soul; still being grieved lest the enemy should take the Word away from the conscience, and so it should become unfruitful.","Wherefore I did labour so to speak the Word, as that thereby, if it were possible, the sins and person guilty might be particularized by it.",281.,"Also, when I have done the exercise, it hath gone to my heart to think the Word should now fall as rain on stony places, still wishing from my heart, O that they who have heard me speak this day did but see as I do what sin, death, hell, and the curse of God is; and also what the grace, and love, and mercy of God is, through Christ, to men in such a case as they are, who are yet estranged from him.","And, indeed, I did often say in my heart before the Lord, That if to be hanged up presently before their eyes would be a means to awaken them, and confirm them in the truth, I gladly should be contented.",282.,"For I have been in my preaching, especially when I have been engaged in the doctrine of life by Christ, without works, as if an angel of God had stood by at my back to encourage me.","Oh, it hath been with such power and heavenly evidence upon my own soul, while I have been labouring to unfold it, to demonstrate it, and to fasten it upon the consciences of others, that I could not be contented with saying, I believe, and am sure; methought I was more than sure, if it be lawful so to express myself, that those things which then I asserted were true.",283.,"When I went first to preach the Word abroad, the doctors and priests of the country did open wide against me.","[61] But I was persuaded of this, not to render railing for railing, but to see how many of their carnal professors I could convince of their miserable state by the law, and of the want and worth of Christ; for, thought I, This shall answer for me in time to come, when they shall be for my hire before their faces (Gen 30:33).",284.,"I never cared to meddle with things that were controverted, and in dispute amongst the saints, especially things of the lowest nature; yet it pleased me much to contend with great earnestness for the word of faith and the remission of sins by the death and sufferings of Jesus; but I say, as to other things, I should let them alone, because I saw they engendered strife, and because that they neither, in doing nor in leaving undone, did commend us to God to be his.","Besides, I saw my work before me did run in another channel, even to carry an awakening word; to that therefore did I stick and adhere.",[62] 285.,"I never endeavoured to, nor durst make use of other men's lines (Rom 15:18)[63], though I condemn not all that do, for I verily thought, and found by experience, that what was taught me by the Word and Spirit of Christ, could be spoken, maintained, and stood to by the soundest and best established conscience; and though I will not now speak all that I know in this matter, yet my experience hath more interest in that text of Scripture than many amongst men are aware (Gal 1:11,12).",286.,"If any of those who were awakened by my ministry did after that fall back, as sometimes too many did, I can truly say their loss hath been more to me than if one of my own children, begotten of my body, had been going to its grave; I think, verily, I may speak it without an offence to the Lord, nothing hath gone so near me as that, unless it was the fear of the loss of the salvation of my own soul.","I have counted as if I had goodly buildings and lordships in those places where my children were born; my heart hath been so wrapped up in the glory of this excellent work, that I counted myself more blessed and honoured of God by this than if he had made me the emperor of the Christian world, or the lord of all the glory of 'the' earth without it!","O these words, ""He which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death"" (James 5:20).","'""The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise"" (Prov 11:30).","""They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever"" (Dan 12:3).","""For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?",Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?,"For ye are our glory and joy"" (1 Thess 2:19,20).","These, I say, with many others of a like nature, have been great refreshments to me.'",287.,"I have observed, that where I have had a work to do for God, I have had first, as it were, the going of God upon my spirit to desire I might preach there.","I have also observed that such and such souls in particular have been strongly set upon my heart, and I stirred up to wish for their salvation; and that these very souls have, after this, been given in as the fruits of my ministry.","I have also observed, that a word cast in by the by hath done more execution in a sermon than all that was spoken besides; sometimes also when I have thought I did no good, then I did the most of all; and at other times when I thought I should catch them I have fished for nothing.",288.,"'I have also observed, that where there hath been a work to do upon sinners, there the devil hath begun to roar in the hearts, and by the mouths of his servants.","Yea, oftentimes when the wicked world hath raged most, there hath been souls awaked by the Word.","I could instance particulars, but I forbear.'",289.,"My great desire in my fulfilling my ministry was to get into the darkest places of the country, even amongst those people that were furthest off of profession; yet not because I could not endure the light, for I feared not to show my gospel to any, but because I found my spirit leaned most after awakening and converting work, and the Word that I carried did lead itself most that way 'also'; ""yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation"" (Rom 15:20).",290.,"In my preaching I have really been in pain, and have, as it were, travailed to bring forth children to God; neither could I be satisfied unless some fruits did appear in my work.","If I were fruitless it mattered not who commended me; but if I were fruitful, I cared not who did condemn.","I have thought of that, ""He that winneth souls is wise"" (Prov 11:30); and again, ""Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord; and the fruit of the womb is his reward.","As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are children of the youth.","Happy is the man that hath filled his quiver full of them; they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate"" (Psa 127:3-5).",291.,"'It pleased me nothing to see people drink in opinions if they seemed ignorant of Jesus Christ, and the worth of their own salvation, sound conviction for sin, especially for unbelief, and an heart set on fire to be saved by Christ, with strong breathing after a truly sanctified soul; that it was that delighted me; those were the souls I counted blessed.'",292.,"But in this work, as in all other, I had my temptations attending me, and that of diverse kinds, as sometimes I should be assaulted with great discouragement therein, fearing that I should not be able to speak the word at all to edification; nay, that I should not be able to speak sense unto the people; at which times I should have such a strange faintness and strengthlessness seize upon my body that my legs have scarce been able to carry me to the place of exercise.",293.,"Sometimes, again, when I have been preaching, I have been violently assaulted with thoughts of blasphemy, and strongly tempted to speak the words with my mouth before the congregation.","I have also at some times, even when I have begun to speak the Word with much clearness, evidence, and liberty of speech, yet been before the ending of that opportunity so blinded, and so estranged from the things I have been speaking, and have also been so straitened in my speech, as to utterance before the people, that I have been as if I had not known or remembered what I have been about, or as if my head had been in a bag all the time of the exercise.",294.,"Again, when as sometimes I have been about to preach upon some smart and scorching[64] portion of the Word, I have found the tempter suggest, What, will you preach this?","this condemns yourself; of this your own soul is guilty; wherefore preach not of it at all; or if you do, yet so mince it as to make way for your own escape; lest instead of awakening others, you lay that guilt upon your own soul, as you will never get from under.",295.,"'But, I thank the Lord, I have been kept from consenting to these so horrid suggestions, and have rather, as Samson, bowed myself with all my might, to condemn sin and transgression wherever I found it, yea, though therein also I did bring guilt upon my own conscience!","""Let me die,"" thought I, ""with the Philistines"" (Judg 16:29,30), rather than deal corruptly with the blessed Word of God, ""Thou that teachest another, teachest not thou thyself?""","It is far better that thou do judge thyself, even by preaching plainly to others, than that thou, to save thyself, imprison the truth in unrighteousness; blessed be God for his help also in this.'",296.,"I have also, while found in this blessed work of Christ, been often tempted to pride and liftings up of heart; and though I dare not say I have not been infected with this, yet truly the Lord, of his precious mercy, hath so carried it towards me, that, for the most part, I have had but small joy to give way to such a thing; for it hath been my every day's portion to be let into the evil of my own heart, and still made to see such a multitude of corruptions and infirmities therein, that it hath caused hanging down of the head under all my gifts and attainments; I have felt this thorn in the flesh, the very mercy of God to me (2 Cor 12:7-9).",297.,"I have had also, together with this, some notable place or other of the Word presented before me, which word hath contained in it some sharp and piercing sentence concerning the perishing of the soul, notwithstanding gifts and parts; as, for instance, that hath been of great use unto me, ""Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, and a tinkling cymbal"" (1 Cor 13:1,2).",298.,"A tinkling cymbal is an instrument of music, with which a skillful player can make such melodious and heart-inflaming music, that all who hear him play can scarcely hold from dancing; and yet behold the cymbal hath not life, neither comes the music from it, but because of the art of him that plays therewith; so then the instrument at last may come to nought and perish, though, in times past, such music hath been made upon it.",299.,"Just thus I saw it was and will be with them who have gifts, but want saving grace, they are in the hand of Christ, as the cymbal in the hand of David; and as David could, with the cymbal, make that mirth in the service of God, as to elevate the hearts of the worshippers, so Christ can use these gifted men, as with them to affect the souls of his people in his church; yet when he hath done all, hang them by as lifeless, though sounding cymbals.",[65] 300.,"This consideration, therefore, together with some others, were, for the most part, as a maul on the head of pride, and desire of vain glory; what, thought I, shall I be proud because I am a sounding brass?",Is it so much to be a fiddle?,"Hath not the least creature that hath life, more of God in it than these?","Besides, I knew it was love should never die, but these must cease and vanish; so I concluded, a little grace, a little love, a little of the true fear of God, is better than all these gifts; yea, and I am fully convinced of it, that it is possible for a soul that can scarce give a man an answer, but with great confusion as to method, I say it is possible for them to have a thousand times more grace, and so to be more in the love and favour of the Lord than some who, by virtue of the gift of knowledge, can deliver themselves like angels.",[66] 301.,"'Thus, therefore, I came to perceive, that though gifts in themselves were good to the thing for which they are designed, to wit, the edification of others; yet empty and without power to save the soul of him that hath them, if they be alone; neither are they, as so, any sign of a man's state to be happy, being only a dispensation of God to some, of whose improvement, or non-improvement, they must, when a little love more is over, give an account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.'",302.,"'This showed me too, that gifts being alone, were dangerous, not in themselves, but because of those evils that attend them that have them, to wit, pride, desire of vain glory, self-conceit, &c., all which were easily blown up at the applause and commendation of every unadvised Christian, to the endangering of a poor creature to fall into the condemnation of the devil.'",303.,"'I saw therefore that he that hath gifts had need be let into a sight of the nature of them, to wit, that they come short of making of him to be in a truly saved condition, lest he rest in them, and so fall short of the grace of God.'",304.,"'He hath also cause to walk humbly with God, and be little in his own eyes, and to remember withal, that his gifts are not his own, but the church's; and that by them he is made a servant to the church; and he must give at last an account of his stewardship unto the Lord Jesus; and to give a good account, will be a blessed thing.'",305.,"'Let all men therefore prize a little with the fear of the Lord; gifts indeed are desirable, but yet great grace and small gifts are better than great gifts and no grace.","It doth not say, the Lord gives gifts and glory, but the Lord gives grace and glory; and blessed is such an one, to whom the Lord gives grace, true grace, for that is a certain forerunner of glory.'",306.,"'But when Satan perceived that his thus tempting and assaulting of me would not answer his design, to wit, to overthrown my ministry, and make it ineffectual, as to the ends thereof; then he tried another way, which was to stir up the minds of the ignorant and malicious, to load me with slanders and reproaches; now therefore I may say, That what the devil could devise, and his instruments invent, was whirled up and down the country against me, thinking, as I said, that by that means they should make my ministry to be abandoned.'",307.,"'It began therefore to be rumoured up and down among the people, that I was a witch, a Jesuit, a highwayman, and the like.'",308.,"'To all which, I shall only say, God knows that I am innocent.","But as for mine accusers, let them provide themselves to meet me before the tribunal of the Son of God, there to answer for all these things, with all the rest of their iniquities, unless God shall give them repentance for them, for the which I pray with all my heart.'",309.,"'But that which was reported with the boldest confidence, was, that I had my misses, my whores, my bastards, yea, two wives at once, and the like.","Now these slanders, with the other, I glory in, because but slanders, foolish, or knavish lies, and falsehoods cast upon me by the devil and his seed; and should I not be dealt with thus wickedly by the world, I should want one sign of a saint, and a child of God.","""Blessed are ye [said the Lord Jesus] when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake;

some indeed have urged the holy kiss; but then I have asked why they made baulks,[69] why they did salute the most handsome, and let the ill-favoured go; thus, how laudable soever such things have been in the eyes of others, they have been unseemly in my sight.'",316.,"'And now for a wind up in this matter, I calling not only men, but angels, to prove me guilty of having carnally to do with any woman save my wife, nor am I afraid to do it a second time, knowing that I cannot offend the Lord in such a case, to call God for a record upon my soul, that in these things I am innocent.","Not that I have been thus kept, because of any goodness in me more than any other, but God has been merciful to me, and has kept me; to whom I pray that he will keep me still, not only from this, but from every evil way and work, and preserve me to his heavenly kingdom.",Amen.',317.,"'Now as Satan laboured by reproaches and slanders, to make me vile among my countrymen, that if possible, my preaching might be made of none effect, so there was added hereto a long and tedious imprisonment, that thereby I might be frighted from my service for Christ, and the world terrified, and made afraid to hear me preach, of which I shall in the next place give you a brief account.'",[A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR'S IMPRISONMENT] 318.,"Having made profession of the glorious gospel of Christ a long time, and preached the same about five years, I was apprehended at a meeting of good people in the country, among whom, had they let me alone, I should have preached that day, but they took me away from amongst them, and had me before a justice; who, after I had offered security for my appearing at the next sessions, yet committed me, because my sureties would not consent to be bound that I should preach no more to the people.",319.,"At the sessions after, I was indicted for an upholder and maintainer of unlawful assemblies and conventicles, and for not conforming to the national worship of the Church of England; and after some conference there with the justices, 'they taking my plain dealing with them for a confession, as they termed it, of the indictment,' did sentence me to perpetual banishment, because I refused to conform.","So being again delivered up to the jailer's hands, I was had home to prison again, and there have lain now[70] 'complete twelve years,' waiting to see what God would suffer these men to do with me.",320.,"In which condition I have continued with much content, through grace, but have met with many turnings and goings upon my heart, both from the Lord, Satan, and my own corruptions; by all which, glory be to Jesus Christ, I have also received among many things, much conviction, instruction, and understanding, of which at large I shall not here discourse; only give you in a hint or two, a word that may stir up the godly to bless God, and to pray for me; and also to take encouragement, should the case be their own, not to fear what man can do unto them.",321.,"I never had in all my life so great an inlet into the Word of God as now; those Scriptures that I saw nothing in before, are made in this place and state to shine upon me; Jesus Christ also was never more real and apparent than now; here I have seen him and felt him indeed: O that word, We have not preached unto you cunningly devised fables (2 Peter 1:16); and that, God raised Christ from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God (1 Peter 1:2), were blessed words unto me in this my imprisoned condition.",322.,"These three or four scriptures also have been great refreshment in this condition to me (John 14:1-4, 16:33; Col 3:3,4; Heb 12:22-24).","So that sometimes when I have been in the savour of them, I have been able to laugh at destruction, and to fear neither the horse nor his rider (Job 39:18).","I have had sweet sights of the forgiveness of my sins in this place, and of my being with Jesus in another world: O, ""the mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, the innumerable company of angels, and God the judge of all, and the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus"" (Heb 12:22-24), have been sweet unto me in this place: I have seen THAT here, that I am persuaded I shall never, while in this world, be able to express; I have seen a truth in that scripture, ""Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye se him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory"" (1 Peter 1:8).",[71] 323.,"I never knew what it was for God to stand by me at all turns, and at every offer of Satan 'to afflict me,' &c., as I have found him since I came in hither; for look how fears have presented themselves, so have supports and encouragements, yea, when I have started, even as it were at nothing else but my shadow, yet God, as being very tender of me, hath not suffered me to be molested, but would with one scripture and another strengthen me against all; insomuch that I have often said, Were it lawful, I could pray for greater trouble, for the greater comfort's sake (Eccl 7:14; 2 Cor 1:5).",324.,"Before I came to prison, I saw what was a-coming, and had especially two considerations warm upon my heart; the first was how to be able to endure, should my imprisonment be long and tedious; the second was how to be able to encounter death, should that be here my portion; for the first of these, that scripture (Col 1:11) was great information to me, namely, to pray to God to be ""strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness.""","I could seldom go to prayer before I was imprisoned, but not for so little as a year together, this sentence, or sweet petition, would, as it were, thrust itself into my mind, and persuade me, that if ever I would go through long-suffering, I must have all patience, especially if I would endure it joyfully.",325.,"As to the second consideration, that saying (2 Cor 1:9), was of great use to me, But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead.","By this scripture I was made to see, that if ever I would suffer rightly, I must first pass a sentence of death upon everything that can properly be called a thing of this life, even to reckon myself, my wife, my children, my health, my enjoyments, and all, as dead to me, and myself as dead to them.","""He that loveth father or mother, son or daughter, more than me, is not worthy of me"" (Matt 10:37).",326.,"The second was, to live upon God that is invisible; as Paul said in another place, the way not to faint, is to ""look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal"" (2 Cor 4:18).","And thus I reasoned with myself; if I provide only for a prison, then the whip comes at unawares; and so does also the pillory; again, if I provide only for these, then I am not fit for banishment; further, if I conclude that banishment is the worst, then if death come I am surprised.","So that I see the best way to go through sufferings is to trust in God through Christ, as touching the world to come; and as touching this world, to count ""the grave my house, to make my bed in darkness, and to say to corruption, Thou art my father, and to the worm, Thou art my mother and my sister.""","That is, to familiarize these things to me.",[72] 327.,"But notwithstanding these helps, I found myself a man, and compassed with infirmities; the parting with my wife and poor children hath oft been to me in this place as the pulling the flesh from my bones, and that not only because I am somewhat too too fond of those great mercies, but also because I should have often brought to my mind the many hardships, miseries and wants that my poor family was like to meet with, should I be taken from them, especially my poor blind child, who lay nearer my heart than all I had besides; O the thoughts of the hardship I thought my blind one might go under, would break my heart to pieces.",328.,"Poor child, thought I, what sorrow art thou like to have for thy portion in this world?","Thou must be beaten, must beg, suffer hunger, cold, nakedness, and a thousand calamities, though I cannot now endure the wind should blow upon thee.","But yet recalling myself, thought I, I must venture you all with God, though it goeth to the quick to leave you.","O, I saw in this condition I was as a man who was pulling down his house upon the head of his wife and children; yet thought I, I must do it, I must do it.","And now I thought on those two milch kine that were to carry the ark of God into another country, and to leave their calves behind them (1 Sam 6:10-12).",329.,"But that which helped me in this temptation was divers considerations, of which three in special here I will name; the first was the consideration of those two scriptures, ""Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive, and let thy widows trust in me.""","And again, ""The Lord said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil,"" &c. (Jer 49:11, 15:11).",330.,"I had also this consideration, that if I should now venture all for God, I engaged God to take care of my concernments; but if I forsook him and his ways, for fear of any trouble that should come to me or mine, then I should not only falsify my profession, but should count also that my concernments were not so sure, if left at God's feet, while I stood to and for his name, as they would be, if they were under my own tuition,[73] though with the denial of the way of God.","This was a smarting consideration, and was as spurs unto my flesh.","That scripture also greatly helped it to fasten the more upon me, where Christ prays against Judas, that God would disappoint him in all his selfish thoughts, which moved him to sell his master: pray read it soberly (Psa 109:6-20).",331.,"I had also another consideration, and that was, the dread of the torments of hell, which I was sure they must partake of, that for fear of the cross, do shrink from their profession of Christ, his words, and laws, before the sons of men; I thought also of the glory that he had prepared for those that, in faith, and love, and patience, stood to his ways before them.","These things, I say, have helped me, when the thoughts of the misery that both myself and mine, might for the sake of my profession be exposed to, hath lain pinching on my mine.",332.,"When I have indeed conceited that I might be banished for my profession, then I have thought of that scripture, ""They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy"" (Heb 11:37), for all they thought they were too bad to dwell and abide amongst them.","I have also thought of that saying, ""The Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, that bonds and afflictions abide me.""","I have verily thought that my soul and it[74] have sometimes reasoned about the sore and sad estate of a banished and exiled condition, how they are exposed to hunger, to cold, to perils, to nakedness, to enemies, and a thousand calamities; and at last, it may be, to die in a ditch, like a poor forlorn and desolate sheep.","But I thank God, hitherto I have not been moved by these most delicate reasonings, but have rather, by them, more approved my heart to God.",333.,"I will tell you a pretty business; I was once above all the rest in a very sad and low condition for many weeks; at which time also I being but a young prisoner, and not acquainted with the laws, had this lay much upon my spirit, That my imprisonment might end at the gallows for aught that I could tell.","Now, therefore, Satan laid hard at me to beat me out of heart, by suggesting thus unto me, But how if when you come indeed to die, you should be in this condition; that is, as not to savour the things of God, nor to have any evidence upon your soul for a better state hereafter?",For indeed at that time all the things of God were hid from my soul.,334.,"Wherefore, when I at first began to think of this, it was a great trouble to me; for I thought with myself, that in the condition I now was in, I was not fit to die, neither indeed did think I could, if I should be called to it: besides, I thought with myself, if I should make a scrabbling[75] shift to clamber up the ladder, yet I should either with quaking, or other symptoms of faintings, give occasion to the enemy to reproach the way of God and his people, for their timorousness.","This therefore lay with great trouble upon me, for methought I was ashamed to die with a pale face, and tottering knees, for such a cause as this.",335.,"Wherefore, I prayed to God that he would comfort me, and give me strength to do and suffer what he should call me to; yet no comfort appeared, but all continued hid: I was also at this time so really possessed with the thought of death, that oft I was as if I was on the ladder with a rope about my neck; only this was some encouragement to me, I thought I might now have an opportunity to speak my last words to a multitude, which I thought would come to see me die; and, thought I, if it must be so, if God will but convert one soul by my very last words, I shall not count my life thrown away, nor lost.",336.,"But yet all the things of God were kept out of my sight, and still the tempter followed me with, But whither must you go when you die?",What will become of you?,Where will you be found in another world?,"What evidence have you for heaven and glory, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified?","Thus was I tossed for many weeks, and knew not what to do; at last this consideration fell with weight upon me, That it was for the Word and way of God, that I was in this condition, wherefore I was engaged not to flinch a hair's breadth from it.",337.,"I thought also, that God might choose, whether he would give me comfort now or at the hour of death, but I might not therefore choose whether I would hold my profession or no: I was bound, but he was free: yea, it was my duty to stand to his word, whether he would ever look upon me or no, or save me at the last: wherefore, thought I, the point being thus, I am for going on, and venturing my eternal state with Christ, whether I have comfort here or no; if God doth not come in, thought I, I will leap off the ladder even blindfold into eternity, sink or swim, come heaven, come hell, Lord Jesus, if thou wilt catch me, do; 'if not,' I will venture for thy name.",338.,"I was no sooner fixed upon this resolution, but that word dropped upon me, ""Doth Job serve God for nought?""","As if the accuser had said, Lord, Job is no upright man, he serves thee for by-respects: hast thou not made a hedge about him, &c. ""But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.""","How now, thought I, is this the sign of an upright soul, to desire to serve God, when all is taken from him?","Is he a godly man, that will serve God for nothing rather than give out?","blessed be God, then, I hope I have an upright heart, for I am resolved, God giving me strength, never to deny my profession, though I have nothing at all for my pains; and as I was thus considering, that scripture was set before me (Psa 44:12-26).",[76] 339.,"Now was my heart full of comfort, for I hoped it was sincere: I would not have been without this trial for much; I am comforted every time I think of it, and I hope I shall bless God for ever for the teaching I have had by it.","Many more of the dealings of God towards me I might relate, but these, ""Out of the spoils won in battles have I dedicated to maintain the house of the LORD"" (1 Chron 26:27).",THE CONCLUSION.,1.,"Of all the temptations that ever I met with in my life, to question the being 'of God,' and truth of his gospel, is the worst, and the worst to be borne;

so that the Irish sixpence was to pass current for fourpence-halfpenny in England.,"That accomplished antiquary, Mr. Hawkins, the curator of the coins in the British Museum, shewed me this Irish silver money; and agreed with me in believing that Bunyan alludes to these Irish sixpences, placing them in company with cracked groats, depreciated in value.",Mr. Hawkins was not aware that they had been in common circulation in England.--Ed.,52.,"'Common or public,' belonging equally to many.","Christ is the federal or covenant head of his church, each member claiming an equal or common right to all his merits as a Saviour, Mediator, and Advocate.--Ed.",53.,"This retort, or rebuke, is inserted twice in the first edition, probably a typographical error.--Ed.",54.,See note on No.,152.,The feelings of Bunyan must have been exceedingly pungent.--Ed.,55.,This is a view of the power given to the apostles to forgive or retain sins worthy of our serious consideration.,"That mysterious power, under the pretence of possessing which merchandise is made of souls, if it was not limited to the apostles personally, was intended to be used by all those whom God sends to preach the gospel; an authority to proclaim salvation or condemnation to those who receive or reject the Saviour.","Bunyan considers it a similar power to that given to the governors of the city of refuge; to admit the terror-stricken soul that 'shall declare his cause'--or confess his guilt--into the city, there to abide the judgment upon him, as in Christ the Refuge.","This is very different to turning God out of his judgment-seat;

and visitors are appointed, to encourage the young convert, and to scrutinize into moral character.","If they are satisfied, he is invited to attend a private church meeting; and if the members have a good hope that he is a decided believer in Jesus, they receive him into their fellowship; and if he requests it, he is publicly baptized in water, and communicates with the church at the Lord's table.",This appears to have been the mode in which Bunyan was admitted into the church at Bedford.,"Most of the Baptist churches now agree with Bunyan, that the baptism of the Holy Ghost, or inward spiritual regeneration, is, alone, the essential pre-requisite to the Lord's table; and they leave members to their own conclusions as to the validity of their having been sprinkled in infancy, or the necessity of immersion in water upon a profession of faith.--Ed.",57.,"Many will be surprised that Bunyan, who was so ready a writer, should be unable to tell what he saw and felt when in these holy enjoyments; but all who have had similar feelings will unite with him in saying, they are inexpressible, great, and full of glory.--Ed.",58.,This is a very correct view of the excellent mode in which dissenting ministers are generally called to their important work.,"First, their gifts in prayer and conversation upon Divine things, and aptness in illustrating and confirming what they advance from the Scriptures, is noticed; and, secondly, they are encouraged to pray with and address the poor children in a Sunday school.","If they manifest an aptness to teach, they are, thirdly, invited to give an exhortation to the church privately; and then, fourthly, they are encouraged to pray and preach among the poor in country villages and in work-houses.","The God who gave the wish and the talent, soon opens a way to still more public usefulness.","In most cases, they enter upon a course of study, to fit them for their momentous labours; but many of our most valuable ministers have, like Bunyan, relied entirely upon their prayerful investigation of the Scriptures.","his college was a dungeon, his library the Bible; and he came forth with gigantic power to grapple with the prince of darkness.",No human learning could have so fitted him for this terrible and mysterious warfare.--Ed.,59.,"'With great sense,' means with great feeling, arising from his own acute experience.--Ed.",60.,"In the first edition Bunyan says, 'I have lain as long,' (five years).",This was in 1666.--Ed.,61.,"When God sends forth a zealous ambassador to publish the glad tidings of salvation to perishing sinners, he will be sure to meet with the fiercest opposition from proud pharisaical professors: so it was from the beginning, and will be to the end of time;

and had also, through his blessed grace, some encouragement by his blessing thereupon; the devil, that old enemy of man's salvation, took his opportunity to inflame the hearts of his vassals against me, insomuch that at the last I was laid out for by the warrant of a justice, and was taken and committed to prison.","The relation thereof is as followeth: Upon the 12th of this instant November 1660, I was desired by some of the friends in the country to come to teach at Samsell, by Harlington, in Bedfordshire.","To whom I made a promise, if the Lord permitted, to be with them on the time aforesaid.","The justice hearing thereof, whose name is Mr. Francis Wingate, forthwith issued out his warrant to take me, and bring me before him, and in the meantime to keep a very strong watch about the house where the meeting should be kept, as if we that were to meet together in that place did intend to do some fearful business, to the destruction of the country; when, alas, the constable, when he came in, found us only with our Bibles in our hands, ready to speak and hear the Word of God; for we were just about to begin our exercise.","Nay, we had begun in prayer for the blessing of God upon our opportunity, intending to have preached the Word of the Lord unto them there present;[1] but the constable coming in prevented us; so that I was taken and forced to depart the room.","But had I been minded to have played the coward, I could have escaped, and kept out of his hands.","For when I was come to my friend's house, there was whispering that that day I should be taken, for there was a warrant out to take me; which when my friend heard, he being somewhat timorous, questioned whether we had best have our meeting or not; and whether it might not be better for me to depart, lest they should take me and have me before the justice, and after that send me to prison, for he knew better than I what spirit they were of, living by them; to whom I said, No, by no means, I will not stir, neither will I have the meeting dismissed for this.","Come, be of good cheer, let us not be daunted; our cause is good, we need not be ashamed of it; to preach God's Word is so good a work, that we shall be well rewarded, if we suffer for that; or to this purpose; but as for my friend, I think he was more afraid of [for] me, than of himself.","After this I walked into the close, where, I somewhat seriously considering the matter, this came into my mind, That I had showed myself hearty and courageous in my preaching, and had, blessed be grace, made it my business to encourage others; therefore, thought I, if I should now run, and make an escape, it will be of a very ill savour in the country.","For what will my weak and newly converted brethren think of it, but that I was not so strong indeed as I was in word?","Also I feared that if I should run, now there was a warrant out for me, I might by so doing make them afraid to stand, when great words only should be spoken to them.","Besides, I thought, that seeing God of his mercy should choose me to go upon the forlorn hope in this country; that is, to be the first, that should be opposed, for the gospel; if I should fly, it might be a discouragement to the whole body that might follow after.","And further, I thought the world thereby would take occasion at my cowardliness, to have blasphemed the gospel, and to have had some ground to suspect worse of me and my profession than I deserved.","These things with others considered by me, I came in again to the house, with a full resolution to keep the meeting, and not to go away, though I could have been gone about an hour before the officer apprehended me; but I would not; for I was resolved to see the utmost of what they could say or do unto me.","For blessed be the Lord, I knew of no evil that I had said or done.","And so, as aforesaid, I began the meeting.","But being prevented by the constable's coming in with his warrant to take me, I could not proceed.","But before I went away, I spake some few words of counsel and encouragement to the people, declaring to them, that they saw we were prevented of our opportunity to speak and hear the Word of God, and were like to suffer for the same: desiring them that they should not be discouraged, for it was a mercy to suffer upon so good account.","For we might have been apprehended as thieves or murderers, or for other wickedness; but blessed be God it was not so, but we suffer as Christians for well doing: and we had better be the persecuted than the persecutors, &c. But the constable and the justice's man waiting on us, would not be at quiet till they had me away, and that we departed the house.","But because the justice was not at home that day, there was a friend of mine engaged for me to bring me to the constable on the morrow morning.","Otherwise the constable must have charged a watch with me, or have secured me some other ways, my crime was so great.","So on the next morning we went to the constable, and so the justice.","[2] He asked the constable what we did, where we were met together, and what we had with us?","I trow, he meant whether we had armour or not; but when the constable told him, that there were only met a few of us together to preach and hear the Word, and no sign of anything else, he could not well tell what to say: yet because he had sent for me, he did adventure to put out a few proposals to me, which were to this effect, namely, What I did there?",and why I did not content myself with following my calling?,"for it was against the law, that such as I should be admitted to do as I did.",John Bunyan.,"To which I answered, that the intent of my coming thither, and to other places, was to instruct, and counsel people to forsake their sins, and close in with Christ, lest they did miserably perish; and that I could do both these without confusion, to wit, follow my calling, and preach the Word also.","At which words, he was in a chafe,[3] as it appeared; for he said that he would break the neck of our meetings.",Bun.,"I said, it may be so.","Then he wished me to get sureties to be bound for me, or else he would send me to the jail.","My sureties being ready, I called them in, and when the bond for my appearance was made, he told them, that they were bound to keep me from preaching; and that if I did preach, their bonds would be forfeited.","To which I answered, that then I should break them; for I should not leave speaking the Word of God: even to counsel, comfort, exhort, and teach the people among whom I came; and I thought this to be a work that had no hurt in it: but was rather worthy of commendation than blame.",Wingate.,"Whereat he told me, that if they would not be so bound, my mittimus must be made, and I sent to the jail, there to lie to the quarter-sessions.","Now while my mittimus was making, the justice was withdrawn; and in comes an old enemy to the truth, Dr. Lindale, who, when he was come in, fell to taunting at me with many reviling terms.",Bun.,"To whom I answered, that I did not come thither to talk with him, but with the justice.","Whereat he supposed that I had nothing to say for myself, and triumphed as if he had got the victory; charging and condemning me for meddling with that for which I could show no warrant; and asked me, if I had taken the oaths?","and if I had not, it was pity but that I should be sent to prison, &c. I told him, that if I was minded, I could answer to any sober question that he should put to me.","He then urged me again, how I could prove it lawful for me to preach, with a great deal of confidence of the victory.","But at last, because he should see that I could answer him if I listed, I cited to him that verse in Peter, which saith, ""As every man hath received the gift, even so let him minister the same,"" &c. Lind.","Aye, saith he, to whom is that spoken?",Bun.,"To whom, said I, why, to every man that hath received a gift from God.","Mark, saith the apostle, ""As every man that hath received a gift from God,"" &c. And again, ""You may all prophesy one by one.""","Whereat the man was a little stopt, and went a softlier pace: but not being willing to lose the day, he began again, and said: Lind.","Indeed I do remember that I have read of one Alexander a coppersmith, who did much oppose and disturb the apostles;--aiming, it is like, at me, because I was a tinker.",Bun.,"To which I answered, that I also had read of very many priests and Pharisees that had their hands in the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.",Lind.,"Aye, saith he, and you are one of those scribes and Pharisees: for you, with a pretence, make long prayers to devour widows' houses.",Bun.,"I answered, that if he had got no more by preaching and praying than I had done, he would not be so rich as he now was.","But that scripture coming into my mind, ""Answer not a fool according to his folly,"" I was as sparing of my speech as I could, without prejudice to truth.","Now by this time my mittimus was made, and I committed to the constable to be sent to the jail in Bedford, &c. But as I was going, two of my brethren met with me by the way, and desired the constable to stay, supposing that they should prevail with the justice, through the favour of a pretended friend, to let me go at liberty.","So we did stay, while they went to the justice; and after much discourse with him, it came to this; that if I would come to him again, and say some certain words to him, I should be released.","Which when they told me, I said if the words were such that might be said with a good conscience, I should, or, else, I should not.","So through their importunity I went back again, but not believing that I should be delivered: for I feared their spirit was too full of opposition to the truth to let me go, unless I should in something or other dishonour my God, and wound my conscience.","Wherefore, as I went, I lifted up my heart to God for light and strength to be kept, that I might not do anything that might either dishonour him, or wrong my own soul, or be a grief or discouragement to any that was inclining after the Lord Jseus Christ.","Well, when I came to the justice again, there was Mr. Foster of Bedford, who coming out of another room, and seeing of me by the light of the candle, for it was dark night when I came thither, he said unto me, Who is there?",John Bunyan?,"with such seeming affection, as if he would have leaped in my neck and kissed[4] me, which made me somewhat wonder, that such a man as he, with whom I had so little acquaintance, and, besides, that had ever been a close opposer of the ways of God, should carry himself so full of love to me; but, afterwards, when I saw what he did, it caused me to remember those sayings, ""Their tongues are smoother than oil, but their words are drawn swords.""","And again, ""Beware of men,"" &c. when I had answered him, that blessed be God I was well, he said, What is the occasion of your being here?",or to that purpose.,"To whom I answered, that I was at a meeting of people a little way off, intending to speak a word of exhortation to them; but the justice hearing thereof, said I, was pleased to send his warrant to fetch me before him, &c. Foster.","So, said he, I understand; but well, if you will promise to call the people no more together, you shall have your liberty to go home; for my brother is very loath to send you to prison, if you will be but ruled.",Bun.,"Sir, said I, pray what do you mean by calling the people together?","My business is not anything among them, when they are come together, but to exhort them to look after the salvation of their souls, that they may be saved, &c. Fost.","Saith he, We must not enter into explication or dispute now; but if you will say you will call the people no more together, you may have your liberty; if not, you must be sent away to prison.",Bun.,"Sir, said I, I shall not force or compel any man to hear me; but yet, if I come into any place where there is a people met together, I should, according to the best of my skill and wisdom, exhort and counsel them to seek out after the Lord Jesus Christ, for the salvation of their souls.",Fost.,"He said, that was none of my work; I must follow my calling; and if I would but leave off preaching, and follow my calling, I should have the justice's favour, and be acquitted presently.",Bun.,"To whom I said, that I could follow my calling and that too, namely, preaching the Word; and I did look upon it as my duty to do them both, as I had an opportunity.",Fost.,"He said, to have any such meetings was against the law; and, therefore, he would have me leave off, and say I would call the people no more together.",Bun.,"To whom I said, that I durst not make any further promise; for my conscience would not suffer me to do it.","And again, I did look upon it as my duty to do as much good as I could, not only in my trade, but also in communicating to all people, wheresoever I came, the best knowledge I had in the Word.",Fost.,"He told me that I was the nearest the Papists of any, and that he would convince me of immediately.",Bun.,I asked him wherein?,Fost.,"He said, in that we understood the Scriptures literally.",Bun.,"I told him that those that were to be understood literally, we understood them so; but for those that were to be understood otherwise, we endeavoured so to understand them.",Fost.,"He said, which of the Scriptures do you understand literally?",Bun.,"I said this, ""he that believeth shall be saved.""","This was to be understood just as it is spoken; that whosoever believeth in Christ shall, according to the plain and simple words of the text, be saved.",Fost.,"He said that I was ignorant, and did not understand the Scriptures; for how, said he, can you understand them when you know not the original Greek?",&c. Bun.,"To whom I said, that if that was his opinion, that none could understand the Scriptures but those that had the original Greek, &c., then but a very few of the poorest sort should be saved; this is harsh; yet the Scripture saith, ""That God hides these things from the wise and prudent,"" that is, from the learned of the world, ""and reveals them to babes and sucklings.""",Fost.,He said there were none that heard me but a company of foolish people.,Bun.,"I told him that there were the wise as well as the foolish that do hear me; and again, those that are most commonly counted foolish by the world are the wisest before God; also, that God had rejected the wise, and mighty, and noble, and chosen the foolish and the base.",Fost.,"He told me that I made people neglect their calling; and that God had commanded people to work six days, and serve him on the seventh.",Bun.,"I told him that it was the duty of people, both rich and poor, to look out for their souls on those days as well as for their bodies; and that God would have his people ""exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day.""",Fost.,"He said again that there was none but a company of poor, simple, ignorant people that came to hear me.",Bun.,"I told him that the foolish and ignorant had most need of teaching and information; and, therefore, it would be profitable for me to go on in that work.",Fost.,"Well, said he, to conclude, but will you promise that you will not call the people together any more?",and then you may be released and go home.,Bun.,I told him that I durst say no more than I had said; for I durst not leave off that work which God had called me to.,"So he withdrew from me, and then came several of the justice's servants to me, and told me that I stood so much upon a nicety.","Their master, they said, was willing to let me go; and if I would but say I would call the people no more together, I might have my liberty, &c. Bun.",I told them there were more ways than one in which a man might be said to call the people together.,"As, for instance, if a man get upon the market place, and there read a book, or the like, though he do not say to the people, Sirs, come hither and hear; yet if they come to him because he reads, he, by his very reading, may be said to call them together; because they would not have been there to hear if he had not been there to read.","And seeing this might be termed a calling the people together, I durst not say I would not call them together; for then, by the same argument, my preaching might be said to call them together.",Wing.,and Fost.,"Then came the justice and Mr. Foster to me again; we had a little more discourse about preaching, but because the method of it is out of my mind, I pass it; and when they saw that I was at a point, and would not be moved nor persuaded, Mr. Foster, the man that did at the first express so much love to me, told the justice that then he must send me away to prison.","And that he would do well, also, if he would present all those that were the cause of my coming among them to meetings.",Thus we parted.,"And, verily, as I was going forth of the doors, I had much ado to forbear saying to them that I carried the peace of God along with me; but I held my peace, and, blessed be the Lord, went away to prison, with God's comfort in my poor soul.","After I had lain in the jail five or six days, the brethren sought means, again, to get me out by bondsmen; for so ran my mittimus, that I should lie there till I could find sureties.","They went to a justice at Elstow, one Mr. Crumpton, to desire him to take bond for my appearing at the quarter-sessions.","At the first he told them he would; but afterwards he made a demur at the business, and desired first to see my mittimus, which run to this purpose: That I went about to several conventicles in this county, to the great disparagement of the government of the church of England, &c. When he had seen it, he said that there might be something more against me than was expressed in my mittimus; and that he was but a young man, and, therefore, he durst not do it.","This my jailer told me; whereat I was not at all daunted, but rather glad, and saw evidently that the Lord had heard me; for before I went down to the justice, I begged of God that if I might do more good by being at liberty than in prison, that then I might be set at liberty; but if not, his will be done; for I was not altogether without hopes but that my imprisonment might be an awakening to the saints in the country, therefore I could not tell well which to choose; only I, in that manner, did commit the thing to God.","And verily, at my return, I did meet my God sweetly in the prison again, comforting of me and satisfying of me that it was his will and mind that I should be there.","[5] When I came back again to prison, as I was musing at the slender answer of the justice, this word dropt in upon my heart with some life, ""For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.""","Thus have I, in short, declared the manner and occasion of my being in prison; where I lie waiting the good will of God, to do with me as he pleaseth; knowing that not one hair of my head can fall to the ground without the will of my Father which is in heaven.","Let the rage and malice of men be never so great, they can do no more, nor go no further, than God permits them; but when they have done their worst, ""We know that all things work together for good to them that love God"" (Rom 8:28).",Farewell.,"Here is the sum of my Examination before Justice Keelin, Justice Chester, Justice Blundale, Justice Beecher, and Justice Snagg, &c. After I had lain in prison above seven weeks, the quarter-sessions was to be kept in Bedford, for the county thereof, unto which I was to be brought; and when my jailer had set me before those justices, there was a bill of indictment preferred against me.","The extent thereof was as followeth: 'That John Bunyan, of the town of Bedford, labourer, being a person of such and such conditions, he hath, since such a time, devilishly and perniciously abstained from coming to church to hear Divine service, and is a common upholder of several unlawful meetings and conventicles, to the great disturbance and distraction of the good subjects of this kingdom, contrary to the laws of our sovereign lord the King,' &c. The Clerk.","When this was read, the clerk of the sessions said unto me, What say you to this?",Bun.,"I said, that as to the first part of it, I was a common frequenter of the church of God.","And was also, by grace, a member with the people over whom Christ is the Head.",Keelin.,"But, saith Justice Keelin, who was the judge in that court?","Do you come to church, you know what I mean; to the parish church, to hear Divine service?",Bun.,"I answered, No, I did not.",Keel.,He asked me why?,Bun.,"I said, Because I did not find it commanded in the Word of God.",Keel.,"He said, We were commanded to pray.",Bun.,"I said, But not by the Common Prayer Book.",Keel.,"He said, How then?",Bun.,"I said, With the Spirit.","As the apostle saith, ""I will pray with the Spirit, and--with the understanding"" (1 Cor 14:15).",Keel.,"He said, We might pray with the Spirit, and with the understanding, and with the Common Prayer Book also.",Bun.,"I said that the prayers in the Common Prayer Book were such as were made by other men, and not by the motions of the Holy Ghost, within our hearts; and as I said, the apostle saith, he will pray with the Spirit, and with the understanding; not with the Spirit and the Common Prayer Book.",Another Justice.,What do you count prayer?,Do you think it is to say a few words over before or among a people?,Bun.,"I said, No, not so; for men might have many elegant, or excellent words, and yet not pray at all; but when a man prayeth, he doth, through a sense of those things which he wants, which sense is begotten by the Spirit, pour out his heart before God through Christ; though his words be not so many and so excellent as others are.",Justices.,"They said, That was true.",Bun.,"I said, This might be done without the Common Prayer Book.",Another.,"One of them said (I think it was Justice Blundale, or Justice Snagg), How should we know that you do not write out your prayers first, and then read them afterwards to the people?",This he spake in a laughing way.,Bun.,"I said, It is not our use, to take a pen and paper, and write a few words thereon, and then go and read it over to a company of people.","But how should we know it, said he?",Bun.,"Sir, it is none of our custom, said I.",Keel.,"But, said Justice Keelin, it is lawful to use Common Prayer, and such like forms: for Christ taught his disciples to pray, as John also taught his disciples.","And further, said he, cannot one man teach another to pray?","""Faith comes by hearing""; and one man may convince another of sin, and therefore prayers made by men, and read over, are good to teach, and help men to pray.","While he was speaking these words, God brought that word into my mind, in the eighth of the Romans, at the 26th verse.","I say, God brought it, for I thought not on it before: but as he was speaking, it came so fresh into my mind, and was set so evidently before me, as if the scripture had said, Take me, take me; so when he had done speaking, Bun.","I said, Sir, the Scripture saith, that it is the Spirit that helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us, with [sighs and] groanings which cannot be uttered.","Mark, said I, it doth not say the Common Prayer Book teacheth us how to pray, but the Spirit.","And it is ""the Spirit that helpeth our infirmities,"" saith the apostle; he doth not say it is the Common Prayer Book.","And as to the Lord's prayer, although it be an easy thing to say, ""Our Father,"" &c., with the mouth; yet there are very few that can, in the Spirit, say the two first words in that prayer; that is, that can call God their Father, as knowing what it is to be born again, and a having experience, that they are begotten of the Spirit of God; which if they do not, all is but babbling, &c.[6] Keel.","Justice Keelin said, that that was a truth.",Bun.,"And I say further, as to your saying that one man may convince another of sin, and that faith comes by hearing, and that one man may tell another how he should pray, &c., I say men may tell each other of their sins, but it is the Spirit that must convince them.","And though it be said that ""faith comes by hearing,"" yet it is the Spirit that worketh faith in the heart through hearing, or else they are not profited by hearing (Heb 4:12).","And that though one man may tell another how he should pray; yet, as I said before, he cannot pray, nor make his condition known to God, except the Spirit help.",It is not the Common Prayer Book that can do this.,"It is the Spirit that showeth us our sins, and the Spirit that showeth us a Saviour (John 16:16); and the Spirit that stirreth up in our hearts desires to come to God, for such things as we stand in need of (Matt 11:27), even sighing out our souls unto him for them with ""groans which cannot be uttered.""",With other words to the same purpose.,At this they were set.,Keel.,"But, says Justice Keelin, what have you against the Common Prayer Book?",Bun.,"I said, Sir, if you will hear me, I shall lay down my reasons against it.",Keel.,"He said, I should have liberty; but first, said he, let me give you one caution; take heed of speaking irreverently of the Common Prayer Book; for if you do so, you will bring great damage upon yourself.",Bun.,"So I proceeded, and said, My first reason was, because it was not commanded in the Word of God, and therefore I could not use it.",Another.,"One of them said, Where do you find it commanded in the Scripture, that you should go to Elstow, or Bedford, and yet it is lawful to go to either of them, is it not?",Bun.,"I said, To go to Elstow, or Bedford, was a civil thing, and not material, though not commanded, and yet God's Word allowed me to go about my calling, and therefore if it lay there, then to go thither, &c. But to pray, was a great part of the Divine worship of God, and therefore it ought to be done according to the rule of God's Word.",Another.,"One of them said, He will do harm; let him speak no further.",Keel.,"Justice Keelin said, No, no, never fear him, we are better established than so; he can do no harm; we know the Common Prayer Book hath been ever since the apostles' time, and is lawful for it to be used in the church.",Bun.,"I said, Show me the place in the epistles where the Common Prayer Book is written, or one text of Scripture that commands me to read it, and I will use it.","But yet, notwithstanding, said I, they that have a mind to use it, they have their liberty;[7] that is, I would not keep them from it; but for our parts, we can pray to God without it.",Blessed be his name.,"With that, one of them said, Who is your God?",Beelzebub?,"Moreover, they often said that I was possessed with the spirit of delusion, and of the devil.",All which sayings I passed over; the Lord forgive them!,"And further, I said, blessed be the Lord for it, we are encouraged to meet together, and to pray, and exhort one another; for we have had the comfortable presence of God among us.",For ever blessed be his holy name!,Keel.,"Justice Keelin called this pedlar's French, saying, that I must leave off my canting.",The Lord open his eyes!,Bun.,"I said, that we ought to ""exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day,"" &c. (Heb 3:13).",Keel.,"Justice Keelin said, that I ought not to preach; and asked me where I had my authority?",with other such like words.,Bun.,"I said, that I would prove that it was lawful for me, and such as I am, to preach the Word of God.",Keel.,"He said unto me, By what scripture?","I said, By that in the first epistle of Peter, chapter 4, the 10th verse, and Acts 18 with other scriptures, which he would not suffer me to mention.","But said, Hold; not so many, which is the first?",Bun.,"I said, this: ""As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.","If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God,"" &c. Keel.","He said, Let me a little open that scripture to you: 'As every man hath received the gift'; that is, said he, as every one hath received a trade, so let him follow it.","If any man have received a gift of tinkering, as thou hast done, let him follow his tinkering.","And so other men their trades; and the divine his calling, &c. Bun.","Nay, Sir, said I, but it is most clear, that the apostle speaks here of preaching the Word; if you do but compare both the verses together, the next verse explains this gift what it is, saying, 'If any man speak let him speak as the oracles of God.'","So that it is plain, that the Holy Ghost doth not so much in this place exhort to civil callings, as to the exercising of those gifts that we have received from God.","I would have gone on, but he would not give me leave.",Keel.,"He said, We might do it in our families, but not otherwise.",Bun.,"I said, If it was lawful to do good to some, it was lawful to do good to more.","If it was a good duty to exhort our families, it is good to exhort others; but if they held it a sin to meet together to seek the face of God, and exhort one another to follow Christ, I should sin still; for so we should do.",Keel.,"He said he was not so well versed in Scripture as to dispute, or words to that purpose.","And said, moreover, that they could not wait upon me any longer; but said to me, Then you confess the indictment, do you not?","Now, and not till now, I saw I was indicted.",Bun.,"I said, This I confess, we have had many meetings together, both to pray to God, and to exhort one another, and that we had the sweet comforting presence of the Lord among us for our encouragement; blessed be his name therefore.",I confessed myself guilty no otherwise.,Keel.,"Then, said he, hear your judgment.","You must be had back again to prison, and there lie for three months following; and at three months' end, if you do not submit to go to church to hear Divine service, and leave your preaching, you must be banished the realm: and if, after such a day as shall be appointed you to be gone, you shall be found in this realm, &c., or be found to come over again without special license from the king, &c.,[8] you must stretch by the neck for it, I tell you plainly; and so bid my jailer have me away.",Bun.,"I told him, as to this matter, I was at a point with him; for if I was out of prison to-day I would preach the gospel again to-morrow, by the help of God.",Another.,"To which one made me some answer; but my jailer pulling me away to be gone, I could not tell what he said.","Thus I departed from them; and I can truly say, I bless the Lord Jesus Christ for it, that my heart was sweetly refreshed in the time of my examination; and also afterwards, at my returning to the prison.","So that I found Christ's words more than bare trifles, where he saith, ""I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist"" (Luke 21:15).",And that his peace no man can take from us.,Thus have I given you the substance of my examination.,The Lord make these profitable to all that shall read or hear them.,Farewell.,"The Substance of some Discourse had between the Clerk of the Peace and myself, when he came to admonish me, according to the tenor of that Law by which I was in Prison.","When I had lain in prison other twelve weeks, and now not knowing what they intended to do with me, upon the 3rd of April 1661, comes Mr. Cobb unto me, as he told me, being sent by the justices to admonish me; and demanded of me submittance to the Church of England, &c. The extent of our discourse was as followeth:-- Cobb.","When he was come into the house he sent for me out of my chamber; who, when I was come unto him, he said, Neighbour Bunyan, how do you do?",Bun.,"I thank you, Sir, said I, very well, blessed be the Lord.",Cobb.,"Saith he, I come to tell you that it is desired you would submit yourself to the laws of the land, or else at the next sessions it will go worse with you, even to be sent away out of the nation, or else worse than that.",Bun.,"I said that I did desire to demean myself in the world, both as becometh a man and a Christian.",Cobb.,"But, saith he, you must submit to the laws of the land, and leave off those meetings which you was wont to have; for the statute law is directly against it; and I am sent to you by the justices to tell you that they do intend to prosecute the law against you if you submit not.",Bun.,"I said, Sir, I conceive that that law by which I am in prison at this time doth not reach or condemn either me or the meetings which I do frequent; that law was made against those that, being designed to do evil in their meetings, making the exercise of religion their pretence, to cover their wickedness.","It doth not forbid the private meetings of those that plainly and simply make it their only end to worship the Lord, and to exhort one another to edification.","My end in meeting with others is simply to do as much good as I can, by exhortation and counsel, according to that small measure of light which God hath given me, and not to disturb the peace of the nation.",Cobb.,"Every one will say the same, said he; you see the late insurrection at London, under what glorious pretences they went; and yet, indeed, they intended no less than the ruin of the kingdom and commonwealth.",[9] Bun.,"That practice of theirs I abhor, said I; yet it doth not follow that, because they did so, therefore all others will do so.","I look upon it as my duty to behave myself under the King's government, both as becomes a man and a Christian, and if an occasion were offered me, I should willingly manifest my loyalty to my Prince, both by word and deed.",Cobb.,"Well, said he, I do not profess myself to be a man that can dispute; but this I say, truly, neighbour Bunyan, I would have you consider this matter seriously, and submit yourself; you may have your liberty to exhort your neighbour in private discourse, so be you do not call together an assembly of people; and, truly, you may do much good to the church of Christ, if you would go this way; and this you may do, and the law not abridge you of it.",It is your private meetings that the law is against.,Bun.,"Sir, said I, if I may do good to one by my discourse, why may I not do good to two?","and if to two, why not to four, and so to eight?",&c.

you are, therefore, denied your meeting so many together, lest you should do harm.",Bun.,"And yet, said I, you say the law tolerates me to discourse with my neighbour; surely there is no law tolerates me to seduce any one; therefore, if I may, by the law, discourse with one, surely it is to do him good; and if I, by discoursing, may do good to one, surely, by the same law, I may do good to many.",Cobb.,"The law, saith he, doth expressly forbid your private meetings; therefore they are not to be tolerated.",Bun.,"I told him that I would not entertain so much uncharitableness of that Parliament in the 35th of Elizabeth, or of the Queen herself, as to think they did, by that law, intend the oppressing of any of God's ordinances, or the interrupting any in the way of God; but men may, in the wresting of it, turn it against the way of God; but take the law in itself, and it only fighteth against those that drive at mischief in their hearts and meetings, making religion only their cloak, colour, or pretence; for so are the words of the statute: 'If any meetings, under colour or pretence of religion,' &c.[10] Cobb.","Very good; therefore the king, seeing that pretences are usually in and among people, as to make religion their pretence only, therefore he, and the law before him, doth forbid such private meetings, and tolerates only public; you may meet in public.",Bun.,"Sir, said I, let me answer you in a similitude: Set the case that, at such a wood corner, there did usually come forth thieves, to do mischief; must there therefore a law be made that every one that cometh out there shall be killed?",May there not come out true men as well as thieves out from thence?,"Just thus it is in this case; I do think there may be many that may design the destruction of the commonwealth; but it does not follow therefore that all private meetings are unlawful; those that transgress, let them be punished.","And if at any time I myself should do any act in my conversation as doth not become a man and Christian, let me bear the punishment.","And as for your saying I may meet in public, if I may be suffered, I would gladly do it.","Let me have but meeting enough in public, and I shall care the less to have them in private.",I do not meet in private because I am afraid to have meetings in public.,"I bless the Lord that my heart is at that point, that if any man can lay anything to my charge, either in doctrine or practice, in this particular, that can be proved error or heresy, I am willing to disown it, even in the very market place;

yet when I do most despise myself, taking notice of that small measure of light which God hath given me, also that the people of the Lord, by their own saying, are edified thereby.","Besides, when I see that the Lord, through grace, hath in some measure blessed my labour, I dare not but exercise that gift which God hath given me for the good of the people.","And I said further, that I would willingly speak in public, if I might.",Cobb.,"He said, that I might come to the public assemblies and hear.",What though you do not preach?,you may hear.,"Do not think yourself so well enlightened, and that you have received a gift so far above others, but that you may hear other men preach.",Or to that purpose.,Bun.,"I told him, I was as willing to be taught as to give instruction, and looked upon it as my duty to do both; for, saith I, a man that is a teacher, he himself may learn also from another that teacheth, as the apostle saith: ""Ye may all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn"" (1 Cor 14:31).","That is, every man that hath received a gift from God, he may dispense it, that others may be comforted;

do you, therefore, hear.",Bun.,"But, Sir, said I, he saith, he that shall leave off either preaching or hearing, &c.

I am sure that is infallible, and cannot err.",Cobb.,"But, said he, who shall be judge between you, for you take the Scriptures one way, and they another?",Bun.,"I said, The Scripture should, and that by comparing one scripture with another; for that will open itself, if it be rightly compared.","As, for instance, if under the different apprehensions of the word Mediator, you would know the truth of it, the Scriptures open it, and tell us that he that is a mediator must take up the business between two, and ""a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one,"" and ""there is one mediator between God and men, [even] the man Christ Jesus"" (Gal 3:20; 1 Tim 2:5).","So likewise the Scripture calleth Christ a complete, or perfect, or able high priest.","That is opened in that he is called man, and also God.",His blood also is discovered to be effectually efficacious by the same things.,"So the Scripture, as touching the matter of meeting together, &c., doth likewise sufficiently open itself and discover its meaning.",Cobb.,"But are you willing, said he, to stand to the judgment of the church?",Bun.,"Yes, Sir, said I, to the approbation of the church of God; the church's judgment is best expressed in Scripture.","We had much other discourse which I cannot well remember, about the laws of the nation, and submission to government; to which I did tell him, that I did look upon myself as bound in conscience to walk according to all righteous laws, and that whether there was a king or no; and if I did anything that was contrary, I did hold it my duty to bear patiently the penalty of the law, that was provided against such offenders; with many more words to the like effect.","And said, moreover, that to cut off all occasions of suspicion from any, as touching the harmlessness of my doctrine in private, I would willingly take the pains to give any one the notes of all my sermons; for I do sincerely desire to live quietly in my country, and to submit to the present authority.",Cobb.,"Well, neighbour Bunyan, said he, but indeed I would wish you seriously to consider of these things, between this and the quarter-sessions, and to submit yourself.","You may do much good if you continue still in the land; but alas, what benefit will it be to your friends, or what good can you do to them, if you should be sent away beyond the seas into Spain, or Constantinople, or some other remote part of the world?",Pray be ruled.,Jailer.,"Indeed, Sir, I hope he will be ruled.",Bun.,"I shall desire, said I, in all godliness and honesty to behave myself in the nation, whilst I am in it.","And if I must be so dealt withal, as you say, I hope God will help me to bear what they shall lay upon me.","I know no evil that I have done in this matter, to be so used.",I speak as in the presence of God.,Cobb.,"You know, saith he, that the Scripture saith, ""the powers that be are ordained of God.""",Bun.,"I said, yes, and that I was to submit to the king as supreme, also to the governors, as to them that are sent by him.",Cobb.,"Well then, said he, the King then commands you, that you should not have any private meetings; because it is against his law, and he is ordained of God, therefore you should not have any.",Bun.,"I told him that Paul did own the powers that were in his day, as to be of God; and yet he was often in prison under them for all that.","And also, though Jesus Christ told Pilate, that he had no power against him, but of God, yet he died under the same Pilate; and yet, said I, I hope you will not say that either Paul, or Christ, were such as did deny magistracy, and so sinned against God in slighting the ordinance.","Sir, said I, the law hath provided two ways of obeying: The one to do that which I, in my conscience, do believe that I am bound to do, actively; and where I cannot obey actively, there I am willing to lie down, and to suffer what they shall do unto me.","At this he sat still, and said no more; which, when he had done, I did thank him for his civil and meek discoursing with me; and so we parted.",O that we might meet in heaven!,Farewell.,J.B.,"Here followeth a discourse between my Wife and the Judges, with others, touching my Deliverance at the Assizes following; the which I took from her own Mouth.","After that I had received this sentence of banishing, or hanging, from them, and after the former admonition, touching the determination of the justices, if I did not recant; just when the time drew nigh, in which I should have abjured, or have done worse, as Mr. Cobb told me, came the time in which the King was to be crowned.","[12] Now, at the coronation of kings, there is usually a releasement of divers prisoners, by virtue of his coronation; in which privilege also I should have had my share; but that they took me for a convicted person, and therefore, unless I sued out a pardon, as they called it, I could have no benefit thereby; notwithstanding, yet, forasmuch as the coronation proclamation did give liberty, from the day the king was crowned to that day twelvemonth, to sue them out; therefore, though they would not let me out of prison, as they let out thousands, yet they could not meddle with me, as touching the execution of their sentence; because of the liberty offered for the suing out of pardons.","Whereupon I continued in prison till the next assizes, which are called Midsummer assizes, being then kept in August 1661.","Now, at that assizes, because I would not leave any possible means unattempted that might be lawful, I did, by my wife, present a petition to the judges three times, that I might be heard, and that they would impartially take my case into consideration.","The first time my wife went, she presented it to Judge Hale, who very mildly received it at her hand, telling her that he would do her and me the best good he could; but he feared, he said, he could do none.","The next day, again, lest they should, through the multitude of business, forget me, we did throw another petition into the coach to Judge Twisdon; who, when he had seen it, snapt her up, and angrily told her that I was a convicted person, and could not be released, unless I would promise to preach no more, &c. Well, after this, she yet again presented another to Judge Hale, as he sat on the bench, who, as it seemed, was willing to give her audience.","Only Justice Chester being present, stept up and said, that I was convicted in the court and that I was a hot-spirited fellow, or words to that purpose, whereat he waived it, and did not meddle therewith.","But yet, my wife being encouraged by the high sheriff, did venture once more into their presence, as the poor widow did to the unjust judge, to try what she could do with them for my liberty, before they went forth of the town.","The place where she went to them was to the Swan Chamber, where the two judges, and many justices and gentry of the country, were in company together.","She then, coming into the chamber with abashed face, and a trembling heart, began her errand to them in this manner:-- Woman.","My Lord (directing herself to Judge Hale), I make bold to come once again to your Lordship, to know what may be done with my husband.",Judge Hale.,"To whom he said, Woman, I told thee before, I could do thee no good; because they have taken that for a conviction which thy husband spoke at the sessions; and unless there be something done to undo that, I can do thee no good.",Wom.,"My Lord, said she, he is kept unlawfully in prison; they clapped him up before there was any proclamation against the meetings; the indictment also is false.","Besides, they never asked him whether he was guilty or no; neither did he confess the indictment.",One of the Justices.,"Then one of the justices that stood by, whom she knew not, said, My Lord, he was lawfully convicted.",Wom.,"It is false, said she; for when they said to him, Do you confess the indictment?","he said only this, that he had been at several meetings, both where there was preaching the Word, and prayer, and that they had God's presence among them.",Judge Twisdon.,"Whereat Judge Twisdon answered very angrily, saying, 'What!","you think we can do what we list; your husband is a breaker of the peace, and is convicted by the law,' &c. Whereupon Judge Hale called for the Statute Book.",Wom.,"But, said she, my Lord, he was not lawfully convicted.",Chester.,"Then Justice Chester said, 'My Lord, he was lawfully convicted.'",Wom.,"It is false, said she; it was but a word of discourse that they took for a conviction, as you heard before.",Chest.,"'But it is recorded, woman, it is recorded,' said Justice Chester; as if it must be of necessity true, because it was recorded.","With which words he often endeavoured to stop her mouth, having no other argument to convince her, but 'it is recorded, it is recorded.",'[13] Wom.,"My Lord, said she, I was a while since at London, to see if I could get my husband's liberty; and there I spoke with my Lord Barkwood, one of the House of Lords, to whom I delivered a petition, who took it of me and presented it to some of the rest of the House of Lords, for my husband's releasement: who, when they had seen it, they said that they could not release him, but had committed his releasement to the judges, at the next assizes.","This he told me; and now I come to you to see if anything may be done in this business, and you give neither releasement nor relief.","To which they gave her no answer, but made as if they heard her not.",[14] Chest.,"Only Justice Chester was often up with this, 'He is convicted,' and 'It is recorded.'",Wom.,"If it be, it is false, said she.",Chest.,"My Lord, said Justice Chester, he is a pestilent fellow, there is not such a fellow in the country again.",Twis.,"What, will your husband leave preaching?","If he will do so, then send for him.",Wom.,"My Lord, said she, he dares not leave preaching, as long as he can speak.",Twis.,"See here, what should we talk any more about such a fellow?",Must he do what he lists?,He is a breaker of the peace.,Wom.,"She told him again, that he desired to live peaceably, and to follow his calling, that his family might be maintained; and, moreover, said, My Lord, I have four small children that cannot help themselves, of which one is blind, and have nothing to live upon, but the charity of good people.",Hale.,Hast thou four children?,said Judge Hale; thou art but a young woman to have four children.,Wom.,"My Lord, said she, I am but mother-in-law to them, having not been married to him yet full two years.","Indeed, I was with child when my husband was first apprehended; but being young, and unaccustomed to such things, said she, I being smayed[15] at the news, fell into labour, and so continued for eight days, and then was delivered, but my child died.",[16] Hale.,"Whereat, he looking very soberly on the matter, said, 'Alas, poor woman!'",Twis.,"But Judge Twisdon told her, that she made poverty her cloak; and said, moreover, that he understood I was maintained better by running up and down a preaching, than by following my calling.",Hale.,What is his calling?,said Judge Hale.,Answer.,"Then some of the company that stood by said, 'A tinker, my Lord.'",Wom.,"Yes, said she, and because he is a tinker, and a poor man, therefore he is despised, and cannot have justice.",Hale.,"Then Judge Hale answered, very mildly, saying, 'I tell thee, woman, seeing it is so, that they have taken what thy husband spake for a conviction; thou must either apply thyself to the King, or sue out his pardon, or get a writ of error.'",Chest.,"But when Justice Chester heard him give her this counsel; and especially, as she supposed, because he spoke of a writ of error, he chafed,[17] and seemed to be very much offended; saying, 'My Lord, he will preach and do what he lists.'",Wom.,"He preacheth nothing but the Word of God, said she.",Twis.,He preach the Word of God!,"said Twisdon; and withal she thought he would have struck her; he runneth up and down, and doth harm.",Wom.,"No, my Lord, said she, it is not so; God hath owned him, and done much good by him.",Twis.,God!,said he; his doctrine is the doctrine of the devil.,Wom.,"My Lord, said she, when the righteous Judge shall appear, it will be known that his doctrine is not the doctrine of the devil.",Twis.,"My Lord, said he, to Judge Hale, do not mind her, but send her away.",Hale.,"Then said Judge Hale, 'I am sorry, woman, that I can do thee no good; thou must do one of those three things aforesaid; namely, either to apply thyself to the King, or sue out his pardon, or get a writ of error; but a writ of error will be cheapest.'",Wom.,"At which Chester again seemed to be in a chafe, and put off his hat, and as she thought, scratched his head for anger: but when I saw, said she, that there was no prevailing to have my husband sent for, though I often desired them that they would send for him, that he might speak for himself, telling them, that he could give them better satisfaction than I could in what they demanded of him, with several other things, which now I forget; only this I remember, that though I was somewhat timorous at my first entrance into the chamber, yet before I went out, I could not but break forth into tears, not so much because they were so hard-hearted against me and my husband, but to think what a sad account such poor creatures will have to give at the coming of the Lord, when they shall there answer for al things whatsoever they have done in the body, whether it be good or whether it be bad.","[18] So, when I departed from them, the Book of Statute was brought, but what they said of it I know nothing at all, neither did I hear any more from them.","Some Carriages of the Adversaries of God's Truth with me at the next Assizes, which was on the 19th of the First Month, 1662.","I shall pass by what befell between these two assizes, how I had, by my jailer, some liberty granted me, more than at the first, and how I followed my wonted course of preaching, taking all occasions that were put into my hand to visit the people of God; exhorting them to be steadfast in the faith of Jesus Christ, and to take heed that they touched not the Common Prayer, &c., but to mind the Word of God, which giveth direction to Christians in every point, being able to make the man of God perfect in all things through faith in Jesus Christ, and thoroughly to furnish him unto all good works (2 Tim 3:17).","[19] Also, how I, having, I say, somewhat more liberty, did go to see Christians at London; which my enemies hearing of, were so angry, that they had almost cast my jailer out of his place, threatening to indict him, and to do what they could against him.","They charged me also, that I went thither to plot and raise division, and make insurrection, which, God knows, was a slander; whereupon my liberty was more straitened than it was before: so that I must not look out of the door.","Well, when the next sessions came, which was about the 10th of the eleventh month, I did expect to have been very roundly dealt withal; but they passed me by, and would not call me, so that I rested till the assizes, which was the 19th of the first month following; and when they came, because I had a desire to come before the judge, I desired my jailer to put my name into the calendar among the felons, and made friends of the judge and high sheriff, who promised that I should be called; so that I thought what I had done might have been effectual for the obtaining of my desire; but all was in vain: for when the assizes came, though my name was in the calendar, and also though both the judge and sheriff had promised that I should appear before them, yet the justices and the clerk of the peace did so work it about, that I, notwithstanding, was deferred, and might not appear; and although, I say, I do not know of all their carriages towards me, yet this I know, that the clerk of the peace did discover himself to be one of my greatest opposers: for, first, he came to my jailer, and told him that I must not go down before the judge, and therefore must not be put into the calendar; to whom my jailer said, that my name was in already.","He bid him put me out again; my jailer told him that he could not, for he had given the judge a calendar with my name in it, and also the sheriff another.","At which he was very much displeased, and desired to see that calendar that was yet in my jailer's hand; who, when he had given it him, he looked on it, and said it was a false calendar; he also took the calendar and blotted out my accusation, as my jailer had writ it.","Which accusation I cannot tell what it was, because it was so blotted out; and he himself put in words to this purpose: 'That John Bunyan was committed to prison, being lawfully convicted for upholding of unlawful meetings and conventicles,' &c. But yet, for all this, fearing that what he had done, unless he added thereto, it would not do; he first run to the clerk of the assizes, then to the justices, and afterwards, because he would not leave any means unattempted to hinder me, he comes again to my jailer, and tells him, that if I did go down before the judge, and was released, he would make him pay my fees, which, he said, was due to him; and further told him, that he would complain of him at the next quarter sessions for making of false calendars; though my jailer himself, as I afterwards learned, had put in my accusation worse than in itself it was by far.","And thus was I hindered and prevented, at that time also, from appearing before the judge, and left in prison.",Farewell.,John Bunyan.,"*** A CONTINUATION OF MR. BUNYAN'S LIFE, BEGINNING WHERE HE LEFT OFF, AND CONCLUDING WITH THE TIME AND MANNER OF HIS DEATH AND BURIAL, TOGETHER WITH HIS TRUE CHARACTER.","Reader, the painful and industrious author of this book has already given you a faithful and very moving relation of the beginning and middle of the days of his pilgrimage on earth; and since there yet remains somewhat worthy of notice and regard, which occurred in the last scene of his life; the which, for want of time, or fear that some over-censorious people should impute it to him, as an earnest coveting of praise from men, he has not left behind him in writing.","Wherefore, as a true friend and long acquaintance of Mr. Bunyan's, that his good end may be known as well as his evil beginning, I have taken upon me, from my knowledge, and the best account given by other of his friends, to piece this to the thread, too soon broke off, and so lengthen it out to his entering upon eternity.","He has told you at large of his birth and education; the evil habits and corruptions of his youth; the temptations he struggled and conflicted so frequently with; the mercies, comforts, and deliverances he found; how he came to take upon him the preaching of the gospel; the slanders, reproaches, and imprisonments that attended him; and the progress he notwithstanding made, by the assistance of God's grace, no doubt to the saving of many souls.",Therefore take these things as he himself has methodically laid them down in the words of verity; and so I pass on as to what remains.,"After his being freed from his twelve years' imprisonment and upwards, for nonconformity, wherein he had time to furnish the world with sundry good books, &c.; and, by his patience, to move Dr. Barlow, the then Bishop of Lincoln,[20] and other churchmen, to pity his hard and unreasonable sufferings, so far as to stand very much his friends in procuring his enlargement, or there perhaps he had died by the noisesomeness and ill usage of the place; being now, I say, again at liberty, and having, through mercy, shaken off his bodily fetters, for those upon his soul were broken before, by the abounding grace that filled his heart, he went to visit those that had been a comfort to him in his tribulation, with a Christian-like acknowledgment of their kindness and enlargement of charity; giving encouragement by his example if it happened to be their hard haps to fall into affliction or trouble, then to suffer patiently for the sake of a good conscience, and for the love of God in Jesus Christ towards their souls; and, by many cordial persuasions, supported some whose spirits began to sink low through the fear of danger that threatened their worldly concernment, so that the people found a wonderful consolation in his discourse and admonitions.","As often as opportunity would admit, he gathered them together in convenient places, though the law was then in force against meetings, and fed them with the sincere milk of the Word, that they might grow up in grace thereby.","To such as were anywhere taken and imprisoned upon these accounts, he made it another part of his business to extend his charity, and gather relief for such of them as wanted.","He took great care to visit the sick, and strengthen them against the suggestions of the tempter, which at such times are very prevalent; so that they had cause for ever to bless God, who had put into his heart, at such a time, to rescue them from the power of the roaring lion, who sought to devour them; nor did he spare any pains or labour in travel, though to the remote counties, where he knew, or imagined, any people might stand in need of his assistance, insomuch that some of these visitations that he made, which was two or three every year, some, though in jeering manner, no doubt, gave him the epithet of Bishop Bunyan, whilst others envied him for his so earnestly labouring in Christ's vineyard, yet the seed of the Word he, all this while, sowed in the hearts of his congregation, watered with the grace of God, brought forth in abundance, in bringing in disciples to the church of Christ.","Another part of his time he spent in reconciling differences, by which he hindered many mischiefs, and saved some families from ruin; and, in such fallings out, he was uneasy, till he found a means to labour a reconciliation, and become a peace maker, on whom a blessing is promised in Holy Writ: and, indeed, in doing this good office, he may be said to sum up his days, it being the last undertaking of his life, as will appear in the close of this paper.","When, in the late reign, liberty of conscience was unexpectedly given and indulged to Dissenters of all persuasions,[21] his piercing with penetrated the veil, and found that it was not for the Dissenters' sake they were so suddenly freed from the prosecutions that had long lain heavy upon them, and set, in a manner, on an equal foot with the Church of England, which the Papists were undermining, and about to subvert.","He foresaw all the advantages that could have redounded to the Dissenters, would have been no more than what Poliphemus, the monstrous giant of Sicily, would have allowed Ulysses, viz., That he would eat his men first, and do him the favour of being eaten last.","For, although Mr. Bunyan, following the examples of others, did lay hold of this liberty, as an acceptable thing in itself, knowing that God is the only lord of conscience, and that it is good at all times to do according to the dictates of a good conscience, and that the preaching the glad tidings of the gospel is beautiful in the preacher; yet, in all this, he moved with caution and a holy fear, earnestly praying for averting the impendent judgments, which he saw, like a black tempest hanging over our heads, for our sins, and ready to break upon us, and that the Ninevites' remedy was now highly necessary.","Hereupon, he gathered his congregation at Bedford, where he mostly lived, and had lived, and had spent the greatest part of his life; and there being no convenient place to be had, for the entertainment of so great a confluence of people as followed him, upon the account of his teaching, he consulted with them, for the building of a meeting house; to which they made their voluntary contributions, with all cheerfulness and alacrity; and the first time he appeared there to edify, the place was so thronged, that many were constrained to stay without, though the house was very spacious, every one striving to partake of his instructions, that were of his persuasion; and show their good will towards him, by being present at the opening of the place; and here he lived in much peace and quiet of mind, contenting himself with that little God had bestowed upon him, and sequestering himself from all secular employments, to follow that of his call to the ministry; for, as God said to Moses, he that made the lips and heart, can give eloquence and wisdom, without extraordinary acquirements in a university.","During these things, there were regulators sent into all cities and towns corporate, to new-model the government in the magistracy, &c., by turning out some, and putting in others.","Against this, Mr. Bunyan expressed his zeal with some weariness, as foreseeing the bad consequence that would attend it, and laboured with his congregation to prevent their being imposed on in this kind; and when a great man in those days, coming to Bedford upon some such errand, sent for him, as it is supposed, to give him a place of public trust, he would by no means come at him, but sent his excuse.","When he was at leisure from writing and teaching, he often came up to London, and there went among the congregations of the nonconformists, and used his talent to the great good liking of the hearers; and even some, to whom he had been misrepresented, upon the account of his education, were convinced of his worth and knowledge in sacred things, as perceiving him to be a man of sound judgment, delivering himself plainly and powerfully; insomuch that many who came as mere spectators, for novelty's sake, rather than to be edified and improved, went away well satisfied with what they heard, and wondered, as the Jews did at the apostles, viz., whence this man should have these things; perhaps not considering that God more immediately assists those that make it their business industriously and cheerfully to labour in his vineyard.","Thus he spent his latter years, in imitation of his great Lord and Master, the ever-blessed Jesus; he went about doing good, so that the most prying critic, or even malice herself, is defied to find, even upon the narrowest search or observation, any sully or stain upon his reputation with which he may be justly charged; and this we note as a challenge to those that have had the least regard for him, or them of his persuasion, and have, one way or other, appeared in the front of those that oppressed him, and for the turning whose hearts, in obedience to the commission and commandment given him of God, he frequently prayed, and sometimes sought a blessing for them, even with tears, the effects of which they may, peradventure, though undeservedly, have found in their persons, friends, relations, or estates; for God will hear the prayers of the faithful, and answer them, even for those that vex them, as it happened in the case of Job's praying for the three persons that had been grievous in their reproach against him, even in the day of his sorrow.","But yet let me come a little nearer to particulars and periods of time for the better refreshing the memories of those that knew his labour and suffering, and for the satisfaction of all that shall read this book.","After he was sensibly convicted of the wicked state of his life, and converted, he was baptized into the congregation and admitted a member thereof, viz., in the year 1655, and became speedily a very zealous professor; but, upon the return of King Charles to the crown, in 1660, he was, on the 12th of November, taken, as he was edifying some good people that were got together to hear the Word, and confined in Bedford jail for the space of six years, till the Act of Indulgence to Dissenters being allowed, he obtained his freedom by the intercession of some in trust and power that took pity of his sufferings; but within six years afterwards [from his first imprisonment] he was again taken up, viz., in the year 1666, and was then confined for six years more, when even the jailer took such pity of his rigorous sufferings that he did as the Egyptian jailer did to Joseph, put all the care and trust into his hands.","When he was taken this last time, he was preaching on these words, viz., ""Dost thou believe on the Son of God?""","and this imprisonment continued six years; and when this was over, another short affliction, which was an imprisonment of half a year, fell to his share.","During these confinements he wrote these following books, viz.",": Of Prayer by the Spirit, The Holy City, Resurrection, Grace Abounding, Pilgrim's Progress, the first part.",[Defence of Justification by Jesus Christ.],"In the last year of his twelve years' imprisonment, the pastor of the congregation at Bedford died, and he was chosen to that care of souls on the 12th of December 1671.","And in this his charge, he often had disputes with scholars, that came to oppose him, as supposing him an ignorant person, and though he argued plainly and by Scripture without phrases and logical expressions; yet he nonplussed one who came to oppose him in his congregation, by demanding whether or no we had the true copies of the original Scriptures; and another, when he was preaching, accused him of uncharitableness, for saying, It was very hard for most to be saved; saying, by that, he went about to exclude most of his congregation; but he confuted him and put him to silence with the parable of the stony ground and other texts out of the 13th of Matthew, in our Saviour's sermon out of a ship, all his method being to keep close to the Scriptures; and what he found not warranted there, himself would not warrant nor determine, unless in such cases as were plain, wherein no doubts or scruples did arise.","But not to make any further mention of this kind, it is well known that this person managed all his affairs with such exactness as if he had made it his study, above all other things, not to give occasion of offence, but rather suffer many inconvencies to avoid; being never heard to reproach or revile any, what injury soever he received, but rather to rebuke those that did; and as it was in his conversation, so it is manifested on those books he has caused to be published to the world; where, like the archangel disputing with Satan about the body of Moses, as we find it in the epistle of Jude, he brings no railing accusation, but leaves the rebukers, those that persecuted him, to the Lord.","In his family he kept up a very strict discipline in prayer and exhortations; being in this like Joshua, as that good man expresses it, viz., Whatsoever others did, as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord; and, indeed, a blessing waited on his labours and endeavours, so that his wife, as the Psalmist says, was like a pleasant vine upon the walls of his house, and his children like olive branches round his table; for so shall it be with the man that fears the Lord; and though by reason of the many losses he sustained by imprisonment and spoil, of his chargeable sickness, &c., his earthly treasures swelled not to excess, he always had sufficient to live decently and creditably, and with that he had the greatest of all treasures, which is content; for, as the wise man says, that is a continual feast.","But where content dwells, even a poor cottage is a kingly palace; and this happiness he had all his life long, not so much minding this world as knowing he was here as a pilgrim and stranger, and had no tarrying city, but looking for one not made with hands, eternal in the highest heavens; but at length, worn out with sufferings, age, and often teaching, the day of his dissolution drew near, and death, that unlocks the prison of the soul, to enlarge it for a more glorious mansion, put a stop to his acting his part on the stage of mortality; heaven, like earthly princes when it threatens war, being always so kind as to call home its ambassadors before it be denounced; and even the last act or undertaking of his was a labour of love and charity; for it so falling out, that a young gentleman, a neighbour of Mr. Bunyan, happening into the displeasure of his father, and being much troubled in mind upon that account, as also for that he had heard his father purposed to disinherit him, or otherwise deprive him of what he had to leave, he pitched upon Mr. Bunyan as a fit man to make way for his submission, and prepare his father's mind to receive him; and he, as willing to do any good office as it could be requested, as readily undertook it; and so, riding to Reading, in Berkshire, he then there used such pressing arguments and reasons against anger and passion, as also for love and reconciliation, that the father was mollified, and his bowels yearned towards his returning son.","But Mr. Bunyan, after he had disposed all things to the best for accommodation, returning to London, and being overtaken with excessive rains, coming to his lodging extreme wet, fell sick of a violent fever, which he bore with much constancy and patience; and expressed himself as if he desired nothing more than to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, in that case esteeming death as gain, and life only a tedious delaying of felicity expected; and finding his vital strength decay, having settled his mind and affairs, as well as the shortness of his time and the violence of his disease would admit, with a constant and Christian patience, he resigned his soul into the hands of his most merciful Redeemer, following his pilgrim from the City of Destruction to the New Jerusalem; his better part having been all along there, in holy contemplation, pantings, and breathings after the hidden manna, and water of life; as by many holy and humble consolations expressed in his letters to several persons, in prison and out of prison, too many to be here inserted at present.","[22] He died at the house of one Mr. Straddocks, a grocer, at the Star on Snowhill, in the parish of St. Sepulchre, London, on the 12th of August 1688, and in the sixtieth year of his age, after ten days' sickness; and was buried in the new burying place near the Artillery Ground; where he sleeps to the morning of the resurrection, in hopes of a glorious rising to an incorruptible immortality of joy and happiness; where no more trouble and sorrow shall afflict him, but all tears be wiped away; when the just shall be incorrupted, as members of Christ their head, and reign with him as kings and priests for ever.",[23] A BRIEF CHARACTER OF MR. JOHN BUNYAN.,"He appeared in countenance to be of a stern and rough temper; but in his conversation mild and affable, not given to loquacity or much discourse in company, unless some urgent occasion required it; observing never to boast of himself, or his parts, but rather seem low in his own eyes, and submit himself to the judgment of others; abhorring lying and swearing, being just in all that lay in his power to his word, not seeming to revenge injuries, loving to reconcile differences, and make friendship with all; he had a sharp quick eye, accomplished with an excellent discerning of persons, being of good judgment and quick wit.","As for his person, he was tall of stature, strong-boned, though not corpulent, somewhat of a ruddy face, with sparkling eyes, wearing his hair on his upper lip, after the old British fashion; his hair reddish, but in his latter days, time had sprinkled it with grey; his nose well-set, but not declining or bending, and his mouth moderate large; his forehead something high, and his habit always plain and modest.","And thus have we impartially described the internal and external parts of a person, whose death hath been much regretted; a person who had tried the smiles and frowns of time; not puffed up in prosperity, nor shaken in adversity, always holding the golden mean.","In him at once did three great worthies shine,     Historian, poet, and a choice divine;     Then let him rest in undisturbed dust,     Until the resurrection of the just.",POSTSCRIPT.,"In this his pilgrimage, God blessed him with four children, one of which, names Mary, was blind, and died some years before; his other children are Thomas, Joseph, and Sarah; and his wife Elizabeth, having lived to see him overcome his labour and sorrow, and pass from this life to receive the reward of his works, long survived him not, but in 1692 she died; to follow her faithful pilgrim from this world to the other, whither he was gone before her; while his works, which consist of sixty books, remain for the edifying of the reader, and the praise of the author.",Vale.,*** MR. JOHN BUNYAN'S DYING SAYINGS.,OF SIN.,"Sin is the great block and bar to our happiness, the procurer of all miseries to man, both here and hereafter: take away sin and nothing can hurt us: for death, temporal, spiritual, and eternal, is the wages of it.","Sin, and man for sin, is the object of the wrath of God.","How dreadful, therefore, must his case be who continues in sin!",For who can bear or grapple with the wrath of God?,"No sin against God can be little, because it is against the great God of heaven and earth; but if the sinner can find out a little God, it may be easy to find out little sins.","Sin turns all God's grace into wantonness; it is the dare of his justice, the rape of his mercy, the jeer of his patience, the slight of his power, and the contempt of his love.","[24] Take heed of giving thyself liberty of committing one sin, for that will lead thee to another; till, by an ill custom, it become natural.","To begin a sin, is to lay a foundation for a continuance; this continuance is the mother of custom, and impudence at last the issue.","The death of Christ giveth us the best discovery of ourselves, in what condition we were, in that nothing could help us but that; and the most clear discovery of the dreadful nature of our sins.","For if sin be so dreadful a thing as to wring the heart of the Son of God, how shall a poor wretched sinner be able to bear it?",OF AFFLICTION.,"Nothing can render affliction so insupportable as the load of sin: would you, therefore, be fitted for afflictions, be sure to get the burden of your sins laid aside, and then what afflictions soever you may meet with will be very easy to you.","If thou canst hear and bear the rod of affliction which God shall lay upon thee, remember this lesson--thou art beaten that thou mayest be better.",The Lord useth his flail of tribulation to separate the chaff from the wheat.,"The school of the cross is the school of light; it discovers the world's vanity, baseness, and wickedness, and lets us see more of God's mind.",Out of dark affliction comes a spiritual light.,In times of affliction we commonly meet with the sweetest experiences of the love of God.,"Did we heartily renounce the pleasures of this world, we should be very little troubled for our afflictions; that which renders an afflicted state so insupportable to many is because they are too much addicted to the pleasures of this life, and so cannot endure that which makes a separation between them.",OF REPENTANCE AND COMING TO CHRIST.,"The end of affliction is the discovery of sin, and of that to bring us to a Saviour.","Let us therefore, with the prodigal, return unto him, and we shall find ease and rest.","A repenting penitent, though formerly as bad as the worst of men, may, by grace, become as good as the best.",To be truly sensible of sin is to sorrow for displeasing of God; to be afflicted that he is displeased by us more than that he is displeased with us.,"Your intentions to repentance, and the neglect of that soul-saving duty, will rise up in judgment against you.","Repentance carries with it a Divine rhetoric, and persuades Christ to forgive multitudes of sins committed against him.","Say not with thyself, To-morrow I will repent; for it is thy duty to do it daily.","The gospel of grace and salvation is above all doctrines the most dangerous, if it be received in word only by graceless men; if it be not attended with a sensible need of a Saviour, and bring them to him.","For such men as have only the notion of it, are of all men most miserable; for by reason of their knowing more than heathens, this shall only be their final portion, that they shall have greater stripes.",OF PRAYER.,"Before you enter into prayer, ask thy soul these questions--1.","To what end, O my soul, art thou retired into this place?",Art thou not come to discourse the Lord in prayer?,Is he present; will he hear thee?,Is he merciful; will he help thee?,Is thy business slight; is it not concerning the welfare of thy soul?,What words wilt thou use to move him to compassion?,"To make thy preparation complete, consider that thou art but dust and ashes, and he the great God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that clothes himself with light as with a garment; that thou art a vile sinner, he a holy God; that thou art but a poor crawling worm, he the omnipotent Creator.",In all your prayers forget not to thank the Lord for his mercies.,"When thou prayest, rather let thy hearts be without words, than thy words without a heart.","Prayer will make a man cease from sin, or sin will entice a man to cease from prayer.",The spirit of prayer is more precious than treasures of gold and silver.,"Pray often, for prayer is a shield to the soul, a sacrifice to God, and a scourge for Satan.","OF THE LORD'S DAY, SERMONS, AND WEEK DAYS.","Have a special care to sanctify the Lord's day; for as thou keepest it, so it will be with thee all the week long.","Make the Lord's day the market for thy soul; let the whole day be spent in prayer, repetitions, or meditations; lay aside the affairs of the other part of the week; let thy sermon thou hast heard be converted into prayer: Shall God allow thee six days, and wilt not thou afford him one?","In the church, be careful to serve God; for thou art in his eyes, and not in man's.","Thou mayest hear sermons often, and do well in practicing what thou hearest; but thou must not expect to be told thee in a pulpit all that thou oughtest to do, but be studious in searching the Scriptures, and reading good books; what thou hearest may be forgotten, but what thou readest may better be retained.","Forsake not the public worship of God, lest God forsake thee, not only in public, but in private.","In the week days, when thou risest in the morning, consider, 1.",Thou must die.,2.,Thou mayest die that minute.,3.,What will become of thy soul.,Pray often.,"At night consider, 1.",What sins thou hast committed.,2.,How often thou hast prayed.,3.,What hath thy mind been bent upon.,4.,What hath been thy dealing.,5.,What thy conversation.,6.,"If thou callest to mind the errors of the day, sleep not without a confession to God, and a hope of pardon.","Thus every morning and evening make up thy accounts with Almighty God, and thy reckoning will be the less at last.",OF THE LOVE OF THE WORLD.,"Nothing more hinders a soul from coming to Christ, than a vain love of the world; and till a soul is freed from it, it can never have a true love for God.","What are the honours and riches of this world, when compared to the glories of a crown of life?",Love not the world; for it [the love of the world] is a moth in a Christian's life.,To despise the world is the way to enjoy heaven; and blessed are they who delight to converse with God by prayer.,"What folly can be greater than to labour for the meat that perisheth, and neglect the food of eternal life?","God or the world must be neglected at parting time, for then is the time of trial.",To seek yourself in this world is to be lost; and to be humble is to be exalted.,"The epicure that delighteth in the dainties of this world, little thinketh that those very creatures will one day witness against him.",OF SUFFERING.,"It is not every suffering that makes a martyr, but suffering for the Word of God after a right manner; that is, not only for righteousness, but for righteousness' sake; not only for truth, but out of love to truth; not only for God's Word, but according to it: to wit, in that holy, humble, meek manner, as the Word of God requireth.","It is a rare thing to suffer aright, and to have my spirit in suffering bent only against God's enemy, sin; sin in doctrine, sin in worship, sin in life, and sin in conversation.","The devil, nor men of the world, can kill thy righteousness, or love to it but by thy own hand; or separate that and thee asunder without thy own act.","Nor will he that doth indeed suffer for the sake of it, or out of love he bears thereto, be tempted to exchange it, for the good will of all the world.",I have often thought that the best of Christians are found in the worst of times.,"And I have thought again that one reason why we are no better, is because God purges us no more.","Noah and Lot, who so holy as they in the time of their afflictions?",And yet who so idle as they in the time of their prosperity?,OF DEATH AND JUDGMENT.,"As the devil labours by all means to keep out other things that are good, so to keep out of the heart as much as in him lies, the thoughts of passing from this life into another world; for he knows if he can but keep them from the serious thoughts of death, he shall the more easily keep them in their sins.","Nothing will make us more earnest in working out the work of our salvation, than a frequent meditation of mortality; nothing hath greater influence for the taking off our hearts from vanities, and for the begetting in us desires after holiness.","O sinner, what a condition wilt thou fall into when thou departest this world; if thou depart unconverted, thou hadst better have been smothered the first hour thou wast born; thou hadst better have been plucked one limb from another; thou hadst better have been made a dog, a toad, a serpent, than to die unconverted, and this thou wilt find true if thou repent not.","A man would be counted a fool to slight a judge, before whom he is to have a trial of his whole estate.","[25] The trial we have before God is of otherguise importance,[26] it concerns our eternal happiness or misery; and yet dare we affront him?","The only way for us to escape that terrible judgment, is to be often passing a sentence of condemnation upon ourselves here.","When the sound of the trumpet shall be heard, which shall summon the dead to appear before the tribunal of God, the righteous shall hasten out of their graves with joy to meet their Redeemer in the clouds; others shall call to the hills and mountains to fall upon them, to cover them from the sight of their Judge; let us therefore in time be posing[27] ourselves which of the two we shall be.",OF THE JOYS OF HEAVEN.,"There is no good in this life but what is mingled with some evil; honours perplex, riches disquiet, and pleasures ruin health.","But in heaven we shall find blessings in their purity, without any ingredient to embitter, with everything to sweeten them.",O!,"who is able to conceive the inexpressible, inconceivable joys that are there?",None but they who have tasted of them.,"Lord, help us to put such a value upon them here, that in order to prepare ourselves for them, we may be willing to forego the loss of all those deluding pleasures here.","How will the heavens echo of joy, when the Bride, the Lamb's wife, shall come to dwell with her husband for ever?","Christ is the desire of nations, the joy of angels, the delight of the Father; what solace then must that soul be filled with, that hath the possession of him to all eternity?",O!,"what acclamations of joy will there be, when all the children of God shall meet together, without fear of being disturbed by the antichristian and Cainish brood!",Is there not a time coming when the godly may ask the wicked what profit they have in their pleasure?,what comfort in their greatness?,and what fruits in all their labour?,"If you would be better satisfied what the beatifical vision means, my request is that you would live holily, and go and see.",OF THE TORMENTS OF HELL.,"Heaven and salvation is not surely more promised to the godly than hell and damnation is threatened to, and shall be executed on, the wicked.","When once a man is damned, he may bid adieu to all pleasures.",Oh!,who knows the power of God's wrath?,none but damned ones.,"Sinners' company are the devil and his angels, tormented in everlasting fire with a curse.",Hell would be a kind of paradise if it were not worse than the worst of this world.,"As different as grief is from joy, as torment from rest, as terror from peace; so different is the state of sinners from that of saints in the world to come.","[Licensed, September 10, 1688.]",FOOTNOTES: 1.,The text from which he intended to preach was 'Dost thou believe on the Son of God?',(John 9:35).,"From this he intended to show the absolute need of faith in Jesus Christ;

and I am heartily sorry for the same.","And I do promise and protest, that from henceforth I will, from time to time, obey and perform his Majesty's laws and statutes, in repairing to the church and Divine services, and do my uttermost endeavour to maintain and defend the same.","And for the third offence he shall be sent to the jail or house of correction, there to remain until the next sessions or assizes, and then to be indicted;

and warrants shall issue to sequester the profits of their lands, and to distrain and sell their goods to defray the charges of their transportation; and for want of such charges being paid, the sheriff may contract with any master of a ship, or merchant, to transport them; and then such prisoner shall be a servant to the transporter or his assigns; that is, whoever he will sell him or her to, for five years.","And if any under such judgment of transportation shall escape, or being transported, return into any part of England, shall SUFFER DEATH as felons, without benefit of clergy.'","Notwithstanding this edict, mark well his words on the next leaf, 'Exhorting the people of God to take heed, and touch not the Common Prayer.'","Englishmen, blush!",This is now the law of the land we live in.,"Roman Catholics alone are legally exempted from its cruel operations, by an Act passed in 1844.",The overruling hand of God alone saved the pious and holy Bunyan from having been legally murdered.--Ed.,9.,"The contemptible and mad insurrection to which Mr. Cobb refers, was the pretext for fearful sufferings to the Dissenters throughout the kingdom.","It is thus narrated by Bishop Burnet, 1660:--'The king had not been many days at Whitehall, when one Venner, a violent fifth-monarchy man, who thought it was not enough to believe that Christ was to reign on earth, and to put the saints in possession of the kingdom, but added to this that the saints were to take the kingdom themselves.",He gathered some of the most furious of the party to a meeting in Coleman Street.,"There they concerted the day and the manner of their rising, to set Christ on his throne, as they called it.","But withal they meant to manage the government in his name, and were so formal that they had prepared standards and colours, with their devices on them, and furnished themselves with very good arms.","But when the day came, there was but a small appearance, not exceeding twenty.","However, they resolved to venture out into the streets, and cry out, No king but Christ.",Some of them seemed persuaded that Christ would come down and head them.,"They scoured the streets before them, and made a great progress.","Some were afraid, and all were amazed at this piece of extravagance.","They killed a great many, but were at last mastered by numbers;

it is in an exceedingly rare little volume, including his poems of ""One thing needful"" and his ""Ebal and Gerizzim""; with ""a catlogue of all his other books.""","London: printed for Nath, Ponder, at the Peacock in the Poultry, 1688.","On the reverse of the title is a singular advertisement; ""This author having published many books, which have gone off very well, there are certain ballad sellers about Newgate, and on London Bridge, who have put the two first letters of this author's name, and his effigies, to their rhymes and ridiculous books, suggesting to the world as if they were his.","Now know that this author publisheth his name at large to all his books, and what you shall see otherwise he disowns.""","Bunyan was imprisoned for teaching the gospel in its purity to the poor, and for refusing conformity to national creeds and ceremonies.","This was as absurd as it would be, to imprison such of the inhabitants of a country who refused to swear that all mankind were of one standard in height; sending those who had consciences to prison, until they pretended that they had grown taller or shorter, and were willing to take the oath.",Mental decision must be formed on evidence.,"God can enlighten the mind to see that he alone can guide us to spiritual worship--that his will must be personally consulted, and unreservedly obeyed.","Such a man feels that his soul's salvation depends upon obedience to God, and not to man.","If human laws send him to jail for refusing to disobey God, he will write upon the prison wall as William Prynne did upon that in the Tower, ""The Lord heareth the poor, and despiseth not HIS prisoners.""","'Christ's presence hath my prison turn'd into     A blessed heaven;

and, as he says, 'through God's grace, with great success.'","It is not probable that, with his characteristic intensity of feeling, and holy fervour in preaching, he ever delivered the same sermon twice; but this was a subject so in unison with his own feelings and experience, that he must have dilated upon it with even unusual interest and earnestness.","The marrow of all these exercises he concentrated in this treatise; and when his judgment was, by severe internal conflicts, fully matured--upon the eve of the close of his earthly pilgrimage, in the last year of his life, 1688--he published it in a pocket volume of eight sheets.","It was soon translated into several languages, and became so popular as to pass through ten editions in English by 1728.","Like other favourite books, it was ornamented with some very inferior wood-cuts.",The object of the author is fully explained in the title to his book.,"It is to display the riches of Divine grace and mercy to the greatest sinners--even to those whose conduct entitled them to be called 'Satan's colonels, and captains, the leaders of his people; and to such as most stoutly make head against the Son of God.'","It is to those who feel themselves to be such, and who make a proper estimate of their own characters, as in the sight of God, that the gracious proclamations of the gospel are peculiarly directed.","They to whom much is forgiven, love much; and the same native energies which had been misdirected to promote evil, when sanctified and divinely guided, become a great blessing to the church, and to society at large.","Bunyan does not stoop to any attempt to reconcile the humbling doctrines of grace to the self-righteous pride of those who, considering themselves but little sinners, would feel contaminated by the company of those who had been such great sinners, although they were pardoned and sanctified by God.","His great effort was directed to relieve the distress and despair of those who were suffering under deep convictions; still, his whole treatise shows that the doctrine of salvation by grace, of free gift, is no encouragement to sin that grace may abound, as some have blasphemously asserted.","It is degrading to the pride of those who have not drunk so deeply of sin, to be placed upon a level with great sinners.","But the disease is the same--in breaking one commandment, the whole law is violated; and, however in some the moral leprosy does not make such fearful ravages as in others, the slightest taint conveys moral, spiritual, and eternal death.","ALL, whether young or old, great or small, must be saved by grace, or fall into perdition.","The difference between the taint of sin, and its awfully developed leprosy, is given.",Who so ready to fly to the physician as those who feel their case to be desperate?,"and, when cured, they must love the Saviour most.","Comparatively little sins before conviction, when seen in the glass of God's law, and in his holy presence, become great ones.","Those who feel themselves to be great sinners, are peculiarly invited to the arms of the Saviour, who saves to the uttermost ALL that come unto him; and it is thus that peculiar consolation is poured in, and the broken heart is bound up.","We are then called by name, as Bunyan forcibly describes it, as men called by name before a court.","'Who first cry out, ""Here, Sir""; and then shoulder and crowd, and say, ""Pray give way, I am called into the court.""","This is thy case, wherefore say, ""Stand away, devil, Christ calls me; stand away, unbelief, Christ calls me; stand away, all ye my discouraging apprehensions, for my Saviour calls me to him to receive of his mercy.""'","'Wherefore, since Christ says come, let the angels make a lane, and let all men give place, that the Jerusalem sinner may come to Jesus Christ for mercy.'",How characteristic is this of the peculiarly striking style of Bunyan!,How solemn his warnings!,"'The invitations of the gospel will be, to those who refuse them, the hottest coals in hell.'",His reasonings against despair are equally forcible: ''Tis a sin to begin to despair before one sets his foot over the threshold of hell gate.,What!,despair of bread in a land that is full of corn!,"despair of mercy, when our God is full of mercy!","when he goes about by his ministers, beseeching of sinners to be reconciled unto him!","Thou scrupulous fool, where canst thou find that God was ever false to his promise, or that he ever deceived the soul that ventured itself upon him?'","This whole treatise abounds with strong consolation to those who are beset with fears, and who, because of these, are ready to give way to despair; it ought to be put into the hands of all such, let them belong to what party they may; for, like our author's other books, nothing of a sectarian nature can be traced in it, except we so call the distinguishing truths of evangelical religion.","There are some very interesting references to Bunyan's experience and life, and one rather singular idea, in which I heartily concur; it is, that the glorified saints will become part of the heavenly hierarchy of angels, and take the places of those who fell from that exalted state (Rev 22:8,9).","To those whose souls are invaded by despair, or who fear that they have committed the sin against the Holy Ghost--to all who pant to have their faith strengthened, and hopes brightened, this little work is most earnestly and affectionately commended.",GEORGE OFFOR.,TO THE READER.,"COURTEOUS READER, ONE reason which moved me to write and print this little book was, because, though there are many excellent heart-affecting discourses in the world that tend to convert the sinner, yet I had a desire to try this simple method of mine; wherefore I make bold thus to invite and encourage the worst to come to Christ for life.","I have been vile myself, but have obtained mercy; and I would have my companions in sin partake of mercy too: and, therefore, I have writ this little book.","The nation doth swarm with vile ones now, as ever it did since it was a nation.","My little book, in some places, can scarce go from house to house, but it will find a suitable subject to spend itself upon.","Now, since Christ Jesus is willing to save the vilest, why should they not, by name, be somewhat acquainted with it, and bid come to him under that name?","A great sinner, when converted, seems a booty to Jesus Christ; he gets by saving such an one; why then should both Jesus lose his glory and the sinner lose his soul at once, and that for want of an invitation?","I have found, through God's grace, good success in preaching upon this subject, and perhaps, so I may by my writing upon it too.1 I have, as you see, let down this net for a draught.","The Lord catch some great fishes by it, for the magnifying of his truth.","There are some most vile in all men's eyes, and some are so in their own eyes too; but some have their paintings, to shroud their vileness under; yet they are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do; and for all these, God hath sent a Saviour, Jesus; and to all these the door is opened.","Wherefore, prithee, profane man, give this little book the reading.","Come; pardon, and a part in heaven and glory, cannot be hurtful to thee.","Let not thy lusts and folly drive thee beyond the door of mercy, since it is not locked nor bolted up against thee.","Manasseh was a bad man, and Magdalene a bad woman, to say nothing of the thief upon the cross, or of the murderers of Christ; yet they obtained mercy; Christ willingly received them.","And dost thou think that those, once so bad, now they are in heaven, repent them there because they left their sins for Christ when they were in the world?","I cannot believe, but that thou thinkest they have verily got the best on't.","Why, sinner, do thou likewise.","Christ, at heaven gates, says to thee, Come hither; and the devil, at the gates of hell, does call thee to come to him.","Sinner, what sayest thou?",Whither wilt thou go?,Don't go into the fire; there thou wilt be burned!,"Don't let Jesus lose his longing, since it is for thy salvation, but come to him and live.","One word more, and so I have done.","Sinner, here thou dost hear of love; prithee, do not provoke it, by turning it into wantonness.","He that dies for slighting love, sinks deepest into hell, and will there be tormented by the remembrance of that evil, more than by the deepest cogitation of all his other sins.","Take heed, therefore; do not make love thy tormentor, sinner.",Farewell.,"GOOD NEWS FOR THE VILEST OF MEN; OR, A HELP FOR DESPAIRING SOULS.",'BEGINNING AT JERUSALEM.',--LUKE 24:47.,"THE whole verse runs thus: 'And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, 'beginning at Jerusalem.'","The words were spoken by Christ, after he rose from the dead, and they are here rehearsed after an historical manner, but do contain in them a formal commission, with a special clause therein.","The commission is, as you see, for the preaching of the gospel, and is very distinctly inserted in the holy record by Matthew and Mark.","'Go-teach all nations,' &c. (Matt 28:19) 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature' (Mark 16:15).","Only this clause is in special mentioned by Luke, who saith, that as Christ would have the doctrine of repentance and remission of sins preached in his name among all nations, so he would have the people of Jerusalem to have the first proffer thereof.","Preach it, saith Christ, in all nations, but begin at Jerusalem.","The apostles, then, though they had a commission so large as to give them warrant to go and preach the gospel in all the world, yet by this clause they were limited as to the beginning of their ministry; they were to begin this work at Jerusalem.","""Beginning at Jerusalem.""","Before I proceed to an observation upon the words, I must, but briefly, touch upon two things: namely, FIRST, Show you what Jerusalem now was.","SECOND, Show you what it was to preach the gospel to them.","FIRST, Jerusalem is to be considered either, First, With respect to the descent of her people; or, Second, With respect to her preference and exaltation; or, Third, With respect to her present state, as to her decays.","First, As to her descent, she was from Abraham, [by] the sons of Jacob, a people that God singled out from the rest of the nations, to set his love upon them.","Secondly, As to her preference or exaltation, she was the place of God's worship, and that which had in and with her the special tokens and signs of God's favour and presence, above any other people in the world.","Hence, the tribes went up to Jerusalem to worship; there was God's house, God's high-priest, God's sacrifices accepted, and God's eye, and God's heart perpetually (Psa 76:1,2, 122; 1 Kings 9:3).","But, Thirdly, We are to consider Jerusalem also in her decays; for, as she is so considered, she is the proper object of our text, as will be further showed by and by.","Jerusalem, as I told you, was the place and seat of God's worship, but now decayed, degenerated, and apostatized.2 The Word, the rule of worship, was rejected of them, and in its place they had put and set up their own traditions: they had rejected, also, the most weighty ordinances, and put in the room thereof their own little things (Matt 15; Mark 7).","Jerusalem was therefore now greatly backslidden, and become the place where the truth and true religion were much defaced.","It was also now become the very sink of sin and seat of hypocrisy, and gulf where true religion was drowned.","Here also now reigned presumption, and groundless confidence in God, which is the bane of souls.","Amongst its rulers, doctors, and leaders, envy, malice, and blasphemy vented itself against the power of godliness, in all places where it was espied; as also against the promoters of it; yea, their Lord and Maker could not escape them.","In a word, Jerusalem was now become the shambles, the very slaughter-shop for saints.","This was the place wherein the prophets, Christ, and his people, were most horribly persecuted and murdered.","Yea, so hardened at this time was this Jerusalem in her sins, that she feared not to commit the biggest, and to bind herself, by wish, under the guilt and damning evil of it; saying, when she had murdered the Son of God, 'His blood be on us, and on our children.'","And though Jesus Christ did, both by doctrine, miracles, and holiness of life, seek to put a stop to their villanies, yet they shut their eyes, stopped their ears, and rested not, till, as was hinted before, they had driven him out of the world.","Yea, that they might, if possible, have extinguished his name, and exploded his doctrine out of the world, they, against all argument, and in despite of heaven, its mighty hand, and undeniable proof of his resurrection, did hire soldiers to invent a lie, saying, his disciples stole him away from the grave; on purpose that men might not count him the Saviour of the world, nor trust in him for the remission of sins.","They were, saith Paul, contrary to all men: for they did not only shut up the door of life against themselves, but forbade that it should be opened to any else.","'Forbidding us,' saith he, 'to speak to the Gentiles, that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway' (1 Thess 2:14-16; Matt 23:35; 15:7-9; Mark 7:6-8; Matt 3:7-9; John 8:33,41; Matt 27:18; Mark 3:30; Matt 23:37; Luke 13:33,34; Matt 27:25; 20:11-16).","This is the city, and these are the people; this is their character, and these are their sins: nor can there be produced their parallel in all this world.","Nay, what world, what people, what nation, for sin and transgression, could or can be compared to Jerusalem?","especially if you join to the matter of fact the light they sinned against, and the patience which they abused.",Infinite was the wickedness upon this account which they committed.,"After all their abusings of wise men, and prophets, God sent unto them John Baptist, to reduce them, and then his Son, to redeem them; but they would be neither reduced nor redeemed, but persecuted both to the death.","Nor did they, as I said, stop here; the holy apostles they afterwards persecuted also to death, even so many as they could; the rest they drove from them unto the utmost corners.","SECOND, I come not to show you what it was to preach the gospel to them.","It was, saith Luke, to preach to them 'repentance and remission of sins' in Christ's name; or, as Mark has it, to bid them 'repent and believe the gospel' (Mark 1:15).","Not that repentance is a cause of remission, but a sign of our hearty reception thereof.","Repentance is therefore here put to intimate, that no pretended faith of the gospel is good that is not accompanied with it; and this he doth on purpose, because he would not have them deceive themselves: for with what faith can he expect remission of sins in the name of Christ, that is not heartily sorry for them?","Or how shall a man be able to give to others a satisfactory account of his unfeigned subjection to the gospel, that yet abides in his impenitency?","Wherefore repentance is here joined with faith, in the way of receiving the gospel.",Faith is that without which it cannot be received at all; and repentance that without which it cannot be received unfeignedly.,"When, therefore, Christ says, he would have a repentance and remission of sins preached in his name among all nations, it is as much as to say, I will that all men everywhere be sorry for their sins, and accept of mercy at God's hand through me, lest they fall under his wrath in the judgment; for, as I have said, without repentance, what pretence soever men have of faith, they cannot escape the wrath to come.","Wherefore Paul said, God commands 'all men everywhere to repent,' (in order to their salvation): 'because he hath appointed a day, in the which he shall judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained' (Acts 17:31).","And now, to come to this clause, 'Beginning at Jerusalem'; that is, that Christ would have Jerusalem have the first offer of the gospel.",1.,"This cannot be so commanded because they had now any more right, of themselves, thereto, than had any of the nations of the world; for their sins had divested them of all self-deservings.",2.,"Nor yet because they stood upon the advance-ground with the worst of the sinners of the nations; nay, rather, the sinners of the nations had the advance-ground of them: for Jerusalem was, long before she had added this iniquity to her sin, worse than the very nations that God cast out before the children of Israel (2 Chron 33).",3.,"It must, therefore, follow, that this cause, 'Beginning at Jerusalem,' was put into this commission of mere grace and compassion, even from the overflowings of the bowels of mercy; for indeed they were the worst, and so in the most deplorable condition of any people under the heavens.3 Whatever, therefore, their relation was to Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob--however they formerly had been the people among whom God had placed his name and worship, they were now degenerated from God, more than the nations were from their idols, and were become guilty of the highest sins which the people of the world were capable of committing.","Nay, none can be capable of committing of such pardonable sins as they committed against their God, when they slew his Son, and persecuted his name and Word.",[DOCTRINE.],"From these words, therefore, thus explained, we gain this observation:--That Jesus Christ.","would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners That these Jerusalem sinners were the biggest sinners that ever were in the world, I think none will deny, that believes that Christ was the best man that ever was in the world, and also was their Lord God.","And that they were to have the first offer of his grace, the text is as clear as the sun; for it saith, 'Beginning at Jerusalem.'","'Preach,' saith he, 'repentance and remission of sins' to the Jerusalem sinners: to the Jerusalem sinners in the first place.","One would a-thought, since the Jerusalem sinners were the worst and greatest sinners, Christ's greatest enemies, and those that not only despised his person, doctrine, and miracles, but that, a little before, had had their hands up to the elbows in his heart's blood, that he should rather have said, Go into all the world, and preach repentance and remission of sins among all nations; and, after that, offer the same to Jerusalem; yea, it had been infinite grace if he had said so.","But what grace is this, or what name shall we give it, when he commands that this repentance and remission of sins, which is designed to be preached in all nations, should first be offered to Jerusalem; in the first place to the worst of sinners!","Nor was this the first time that the grace, which was in the heart of Christ, thus showed itself to the world.","For while he was yet alive, even while he was yet in Jerusalem, and perceived, even among these Jerusalem sinners, which was the most vile among them, he still, in his preaching, did signify that he had a desire that the worst of these worst should, in the first place, come unto him.","The which he showeth, where he saith to the better sort of them, 'The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you' (Matt 21:31).","Also when he compared Jerusalem with the sinners of the nations, then he commands that the Jerusalem sinners should have the gospel at present confined to them.","'Go not,' saith he, 'into the way of the Gentiles, and into any of the cities of the Samaritans enter ye not; but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel' (Matt 10:5,6; 23:37).","But go rather to them, for they were in the most fearful plight.","These, therefore, must have the cream of the gospel, namely, the first offer thereof, in his lifetime; yea, when he departed out of the world, he left this as part of his last will with his preachers, that they also should offer it first to Jerusalem.","He had a mind, a careful mind, as it seems, to privilege the worst of sinners with the fist offer of mercy, and to take from among them a people, to be the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb.","The 15th of Luke also is famous for this, where the Lord Jesus takes more care, as appears there by three parables, for the lost sheep, lost groat, and the prodigal son, than for the other sheep, the other pence, or for the son that said he had never transgressed; yea, he shows that there is joy in heaven, among the angels of God, at the repentance of one sinner, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance.","After this manner, therefore, the mind of Christ was set on the salvation of the biggest sinners in his lifetime.","But join to this, this clause, which he carefully put into the apostles' commission to preach, when he departed hence to the Father, and then you shall see that his heart was vehemently set upon it; for these were part of his last words with them, Preach my gospel to all nations, but that you begin at Jerusalem.","Nor did the apostles overlook this clause when their Lord was gone into heaven; they went first to them of Jerusalem, and preached Christ's gospel to them; they abode also there for a season and time, and preached it to nobody else, for they had regard to the commandment of their Lord.","And it is to be observed, namely, that the first sermon which they preached after the ascension of Christ, it was preached to the very worst of these Jerusalem sinners, even to those that were the murderers of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:23), for these are part of the sermon: 'Ye took him, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain him.'","Yea, the next sermon, and the next, and also the next to that, was preached to the self-same murderers, to the end they might be saved (Acts 3:14-16; 4:10,11; 5:30; 7:52).","But we will return to the first sermon that was preached to these Jerusalem sinners, by which will be manifest more than great grace, if it be duly considered.","For after that Peter, and the rest of the apostles, had, in their exhortation, persuaded these wretches to believe that they had killed the Prince of life; and after they had duly fallen under the guilt of their murder, saying, 'Men and brethren, what shall we do?'","he replies, by an universal tender to them all in general, considering them as Christ's killers, that if they were sorry for what they had done, and would be baptized for the remission of their sins in his name, they should receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (Acts 2:37,38).","This he said to them all, though he knew that they were such sinners.","Yea, he said it without the least stick or stop, or pause of spirit, as to whether he had best to say so or no.","Nay, so far off was Peter from making an objection against one of them, that, by a particular clause in his exhortation, he endeavours, that not one of them may escape the salvation offered.","'Repent,' saith he, 'and be baptized every one of you.'","I shut out never an one of you; for I am commanded by my Lord to deal with you, as it were, one by one, by the word of his salvation.",But why speaks he so particularly?,Oh!,there were reasons for it.,"The people with whom the apostles were now to deal, as they were murderers of our Lord, and to be charged in the general with his blood, so they had their various and particular acts of villany in the guilt thereof, now lying upon their consciences.","And the guilt of these, their various and particular acts of wickedness, could not, perhaps, be reached to a removal thereof but by this particular application.","Repent, every one of you; be baptized, every one of you, in his name, for the remission of sins, and you shall, every one of you, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.",Objector.,'But I was one of them that plotted to take away his life.,May I be saved by him?',Peter.,Every one of you.,Objector.,'But I was one of them that bare false witness against him.,Is there grace for me?',Peter.,For every one of you.,Objector.,"'But I was one of them that cried out, Crucify him, crucify him;

these Jerusalem sinners must have this offer again and again; every one of them must be offered it over and over.","Christ would not take their first rejection for a denial, nor their second repulse for a denial; but he will have grace offered once, and twice, and thrice, to these Jerusalem sinners.",Is not this amazing grace?,Christ will not be put off.,These are the sinners that are sinners indeed.,"They are sinners of the biggest sort; consequently, such as Christ can, if they convert and be saved, best serve his ends and designs upon.",Of which more anon.,But what a pitch of grace is this!,"Christ is minded to amaze the world, and to show that he acteth not like the children of men.","This is that which he said of old, 'I will not execute the fierceness of my wrath, I will not return to destroy Ephraim; for I am God and not man' (Hosea 11:9).5 This is not the manner of men; men are shorter winded; men are soon moved to take vengeance, and to right themselves in a way of wrath and indignation.","But God is full of grace, full of patience, ready to forgive, and one that delights in mercy.",All this is seen in our text.,"The biggest sinners must first be offered mercy; they must, I say, have the cream of the gospel offered unto them.",But we will a little proceed.,"In the third chapter we find, that they who escaped converting by the first sermon, are called upon again to accept of grace and forgiveness, for their murder committed upon the Son of God.","You have killed, yea, 'ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; and killed the Prince of life.'","Mark, he falls again upon the very men that actually were, as you have it in the chapters following, his very betrayers and murderers (Acts 3:14,15), as being loath that they should escape the mercy of forgiveness: and exhorts them again to repent, that their sins might 'be blotted out'(verse 19,20).","Again, in the fourth chapter, he charges them afresh with this murder (verse 10), but withal tells them salvation is in no other.","Then, like a heavenly decoy, he puts himself also among them, to draw them the better under the net of the gospel; saying, 'There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved' (verse 12).","In the fifth chapter, you find them railing at him, because he continued preaching among them salvation in the name of Jesus.","But he tells them, that that very Jesus whom they had slain and hanged on a tree, him God had raised up, and exalted 'to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins' (verse 29-31).","Still insinuating, that though they had killed him, and to this day rejected him, yet his business was to bestow upon them repentance and forgiveness of sins.","'Tis true, after they began to kill again, and when nothing but killing would serve their turn, then they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.","Yet even some of them so hankered after the conversion of the Jews, that they preached the gospel only to them.","Also the apostles still made their abode at Jerusalem, in hopes that they might let down their net for another draught of these Jerusalem sinners.","Neither did Paul and Barnabas, who were the ministers of God to the Gentiles, but offer the gospel, in the first place, to those of them that, for their wickedness, were scattered, like vagabonds, among the nations; yea, and when they rendered rebellion and blasphemy for their service and love, they replied it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to them (Acts 1:8; 13:46,47).","Nor was this their preaching unsuccessful among these people: but the Lord Jesus so wrought with the word thus spoken, that thousands of them came flocking to him for mercy.","Three thousand of them closed with him at the first; and, afterwards, two thousand more; for now they were in number about five thousand; whereas, before sermons were preached to these murderers, the number of the disciples was not above 'a hundred and twenty' (Acts 1:15; 2:41; 4:4).","Also among these people that thus flocked to him for mercy, there was a 'great company of the priests' (Acts 6:7).","Now, the priests were they that were the greatest of these biggest sinners; they were the ringleaders, they were the inventors and ringleaders in the mischief.","It was they that set the people against the Lord Jesus, and that were the cause why the uproar increased, until Pilate had given sentence upon him.","'The chief priests and elders,' says the text, 'persuaded (the people) the multitude, that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus' (Matt 27:20).","And yet, behold the priests, yea, a great company of the priests, became obedient to the faith.6 Oh, the greatness of the grace of Christ, that he should be thus in love with the souls of Jerusalem sinners!",that he should be thus delighted with the salvation of the Jerusalem sinners!,"that he should not only will that his gospel should be offered them, but that it should be offered unto them first, and before other sinners were admitted to a hearing of it.",'Begin at Jerusalem.',"Was this doctrine well believed, where would there be a place for a doubt, or a fear of the damnation of the soul, if the sinner be penitent, how bad a life soever he has lived, how many soever in number are his sins?","But this grace is hid from the eyes of men; the devil hides it from them; for he knows it is alluring, he knows it has an attracting virtue in it; for this is it that, above all arguments, can draw the soul to God.","I cannot help it, but must let drop another word.","The first church, the Jerusalem church, from whence the gospel was to be sent into all the world, was a church made up of Jerusalem sinners.",These great sinners were here the most shining monuments of the exceeding grace of God.,"Thus, you see, I have proved the doctrine; and that not only by showing you that this was the practice of the Lord Jesus Christ in his lifetime, but his last will when he went up to God; saying, Begin to preach at Jerusalem.","Yea, it is yet further manifested, in that when his ministers first began to preach there, he joined his power to the word, to the converting of thousands of his betrayers and murderers, and also many of the ringleading priests, to the faith.","I shall now proceed, and shall show you, FIRST, The reasons of the point.","SECOND, And then make some application of the whole.",[THE REASONS OF THE POINT.],"The observation, you know, is this: Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, to the Jerusalem sinners: 'Preach repentance, and remission of sins, in my name, among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.'","The reasons of the point are:-- First, Because the biggest sinners have most need thereof.","He that has most need, reason says, should be helped first.","I mean, when a helping hand is offered, and now it is; for the gospel of the grace of God is sent to help the world (Act 16:9).",But the biggest sinner has most need.,"Therefore, in reason, when mercy is sent down from heaven to men, the worst of men should have the first offer of it.",'Begin at Jerusalem.',"This is the reason which the Lord Christ himself renders, why, in his lifetime, he left the best, and turned him to the worst; why he sat so loose from the righteous, and stuck so close to the wicked.","'The whole,' saith he, 'have no need of the physician, but the sick.","I came not to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance' (Mark 2:15-17).7 Above, you read that the scribes and Pharisees said to his disciples, 'How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?'",Alas!,"they did not know the reason; but the Lord renders them one, and such an one as is both natural and cogent, saying, These have need, most need.","Their great necessity requires that I should be most friendly, and show my grace first to them.","Not that the other were sinless, and so had no need of a Saviour; but the publicans and their companions were the biggest sinners; they were, as to view, worse than the scribes; and, therefore, in reason, should be helped first, because they had most need of a Saviour.","Men that are at the point to die, have more need of the physician than they that are but now and then troubled with a heart-fainting qualm.","The publicans and sinners were, as it were, in the mouth of death; death was swallowing of them down:8 and, therefore, the Lord Jesus receives them first; offers them mercy first.","'The whole have no need of the physician, but the sick.","I came not to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance.'","The sick, as I said, is the biggest sinner, whether he sees his disease or not.","He is stained from head to foot, from heart to life and conversation.","This man, in every man's judgment, has the most need of mercy.","There is nothing attends him from bed to board, and from board to bed again, but the visible characters, and obvious symptoms, of eternal damnation.","This, therefore, is the man that has need, most need; and, therefore, in reason, should be helped in the first place.","Thus it was with the people concerned in the text; they were the worst of sinners, Jerusalem sinners, sinners of the biggest size; and, therefore, such as had the greatest need; wherefore they must have mercy offered to them, before it be offered to anywhere else in the world.","'Begin at Jerusalem,' offer mercy first to a Jerusalem sinner.","This man has most need, he is furthest from God, nearest to hell, and so one that has most need.","This man's sins are in number the most, in cry the loudest, in weight the heaviest, and, consequently, will sink him soonest; wherefore he has most need of mercy.","This man is shut up in Satan's hand, fastest bound in the cords of his sins: one that justice is whetting his sword to cut off; and, therefore, has most need, not only of mercy, but that it should be extended to him in the first place.","But a little further to show you the true nature of this reason, to wit, That Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners.","First, Mercy ariseth from the bowels and compassion, from pity, and from a feeling of the condition of those in misery.","'In his love, and in his pity, he redeemed them.'","And again, 'The Lord is pitiful, very pitiful, and of tender mercy' (Isa 63:9; James 5:11).","Now, where pity and compassion is, there is yearning of bowels; and where there is that, there is a readiness to help.","And, I say again, the more deplorable and dreadful the condition is, the more directly doth bowels and compassion turn themselves to such, and offer help and deliverance.","All this flows from our first scripture proof, I came to call them that have need; to call them first, while the rest look on and murmur.","'How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?'","Ephraim was a revolter from God, a man that had given himself up to devilism; a company of men, the ten tribes that worshipped devils, while Judah kept with his God.","But 'how shall I give thee up, Ephraim?","How shall I deliver thee, Israel?",How shall I make thee as Admah?,How shall I set thee as Zeboim?,"[and yet thou art worse than they, nor has Samaria committed half thy sins (Eze 16:46-51)] Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together' (Hosea 11:8).",But where do you find that ever the Lord did thus rowl9 in his bowels for and after any self-righteous man?,"No, no; they are the publicans and harlots, idolaters and Jerusalem sinners, for whom his bowels thus yearn and tumble about within him: for, alas!","poor worms, they have most need of mercy.","Had not the good Samaritan more compassion for that man that fell among thieves (though that fall was occasioned by his going from the place where they worshipped God, to Jericho, the cursed city), than we read he had for any other besides?","His wine was for him, his oil was for him, his beast for him; his penny, his care, and his swaddling bands for him; for, alas!","wretch, he had most need (Luke 10:30-35).","Zaccheus the publican, the chief of the publicans, one that had made himself the richer by wronging of others; the Lord at that time singled him out from all the rest of his brother publicans, and that in the face of many Pharisees, and proclaimed in the audience of them all, that that day salvation was come to his house (Luke 19:1-8).","The woman, also, that had been bound down by Satan for eighteen years together, his compassions putting him upon it, he loosed her, though those that stood by snarled at him for so doing (Luke 13:11-13).","And why the woman of Sarepta, and why Naaman the Syrian, rather than widows and lepers of Israel, but because their conditions were more deplorable; for that they were most forlorn, and furthest from help (Luke 4:25,27).","But I say, why all these, thus named?","Why have we not a catalogue of some holy men that were so in their own eyes, and in the judgment of the world?",Alas!,"if, at any time, any of them are mentioned, how seemingly coldly doth the record of scripture present them to us?","Nicodemus, a night professor, and Simon the Pharisee, with his fifty pence, and their great ignorance of the methods of grace, we have now and then touched upon.",Mercy seems to be out of its proper channel when it deals with self-righteous men; but then it runs with a full stream when it extends itself to the biggest sinners.,"As God's mercy is not regulated by man's goodness, nor obtained by man's worthiness, so not much set out by saving of any such.",But more of this anon.,"And here let me ask my reader a question: Suppose that, as thou art walking by some pond side, thou shouldst espy in it four or five children, all in danger of drowning, and one in more danger than all the rest; judge which has most need to be helped out first?","I know thou wilt say, he that is nearest drowning.","Why, this is the case; the bigger sinner, the nearer drowning; therefore, the bigger sinner, the more need of mercy; yea, of help, by mercy, in the first place.","And to this our text agrees, when it saith, 'Beginning at Jerusalem.'","Let the Jerusalem sinner, says Christ, have the first offer, the first invitation, the first tender of my grace and mercy; for he is the biggest sinner, and so has most need thereof.","Second, Christ Jesus would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, because when they, any of them, receive it, it redounds most to the fame of his name.","Christ Jesus, as you may perceive, has put himself under the term of a physician, a doctor for curing of diseases; and you know that applause and fame are things that physicians much desire.","That is it that helps them to patients; and that, also, that will help their patients to commit themselves to their skill, for cure, with the more confidence and repose of spirit.","And the best way for a doctor or physician to get himself a name, is, in the first place, to take in hand, and cure, some such as all others have given up for lost and dead.","Physicians get neither name nor fame by pricking of wheals,10 or picking out thistles, or by laying of plasters to the scratch of a pin; every old woman can do this.","But if they would have a name and a fame, if they will have it quickly, they must, as I said, do some great and desperate cures.","Let them fetch one to life that was dead; let them recover one to his wits that was mad; let them make one that was born blind to see; or let them give ripe wits to a fool: these are notable cures, and he that can do thus, and if he doth thus first, he shall have the name and fame he desires; he may lie a-bed till noon.","Why, Christ Jesus forgiveth sins for a name, and so begets for himself a good report in the hearts of the children of men.","And, therefore, in reason he must be willing, as, also, he did command, that his mercy should be offered first to the biggest sinners.","I will forgive their sins, iniquities, and transgressions, says he, 'And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour, before all the nations of the earth' (Jer 33:8,9).","And hence it is, that, at his first appearing, he took upon him to do such mighty works; he got a fame thereby, he got a name thereby (Matt 4:23,24).","When Christ had cast the legion of devils out of the man of whom you read (Mark 5), he bid him go home to his friends, and tell it.","'Go home,' saith he, 'to thy friends, and tell them how great things God hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee' (Mark 5:19).","Christ Jesus seeks a name, and desireth a fame in the world; and, therefore, or the better to obtain that, he commands that mercy should first be proffered to the biggest sinners; because, by the saving of one of them, he makes all men marvel.","As it is said of the man last mentioned, whom Christ cured towards the beginning of his ministry.","'And he departed,' says the text, 'and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him; and all men did marvel' (Mark 5:20).","When John told Christ, that they saw one casting out devils in his name, and they forbade him, because he followed not with them, what is the answer of Christ?","'Forbid him not; for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me' (Mark 9:39).","No; they will rather cause his praise to be heard, and his name to be magnified, and so put glory on the head of Christ.","But we will follow, a little, our metaphor.","Christ, as I said, has put himself under the term of a physician; consequently, he desireth that his fame, as to the salvation of sinners, may spread abroad, that the world may see what he can do.","And to this end, has not only commanded that the biggest sinners should have the first offer of his mercy, but has, as physicians do,11 put out his bills, and published his doings, that things may be read and talked of.","Yea, he has, moreover, in these, his blessed bills, the holy scriptures I mean, inserted the very names of persons, the places of their abode, and the great cures that, by the means of his salvation, he has wrought upon them to this very end.","Here is, Item, such an one, by my grace and redeeming blood, was made a monument of everlasting life; and such an one, by my perfect obedience, became an heir of glory.",And then he produceth their names.,"Item, I saved Lot from the guilt and damnation that he had procured for himself by his incest.","Item, I saved David from the vengeance that belonged to him for committing of adultery and murder.","Here is, also, Solomon, Manasseh, Peter, Magdalene, and many others, made mention of in this book.","Yea, here are their names, their sins, and their salvations recorded together, that you may read and know what a Saviour he is, and do him honour in the world.","For why are these things thus recorded, but to show to sinners what he can do, to the praise and glory of his grace?","And it is observable, as I said before, we have but very little of the salvation of little sinners mentioned in God's book, because that would not have answered the design, to wit, to bring glory and fame to the name of the Son of God.","What should be the reason, think you, why Christ should so easily take a denial of the great ones that were the grandeur of the world, and struggle so hard for hedge-creepers12 and highwaymen, as that parable seems to import he doth, but to show forth the riches of the glory of his grace, to his praise?",(Luke 14).,"This, I say, is one reason, to be sure.","They that had their grounds, their yoke of oxen, and their marriage joys, were invited to come; but they made the excuse, and that served the turn.","But when he comes to deal with the worst, he saith to his servants, Go ye out and bring them in hither.","'Go out quickly-and bring in hither the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind.'",And they did so.,"And he said again, 'Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled' (Luke 14:18,19,23).","These poor, lame, maimed, blind, hedge-creepers, and highwaymen, must come in, must be forced in.","These, if saved, will make his merit shine.","When Christ was crucified, and hanged up between the earth and heavens, there were two thieves crucified with him; and, behold, he lays hold of one of them, and will have him away with him to glory.","Was not this a strange act, and a display of unthought-of grace?","Were there none but thieves there, or were the rest of that company out of his reach?","Could he not, think you, have stooped from the cross to the ground, and have laid hold on some honester man, if he would?","Yes, doubtless.",Oh!,"but then he would not have displayed his grace, nor so have pursued his own designs, namely, to get to himself a praise and a name; but now he has done it to purpose.","For who that shall read this story, but must confess, that the Son of God is full of grace; for a proof of the riches thereof, he left behind him, when, upon the cross, he took the thief away with him to glory.","Nor can this one act of his be buried; it will be talked of, to the end of the world, to his praise.",'Men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts; and I will declare thy greatness.,"They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness-They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom' (Psa 145:6-12).","When the Word of God came among the conjurors and those soothsayers, that you read of (Acts 19), and had prevailed with some of them to accept of the grace of Christ, the Holy Ghost records it with a boast, for that it would redound to his praise, saying, 'Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.","So mightily grew the Word of God, and prevailed' (Acts 19:19,20).",It wrenched out of the clutches of Satan some of those of whom he thought himself most sure.,'So mightily grew the Word of God.',"It grew mightily, it encroached upon the kingdom of the devil.","It pursued him, and took the prey; it forced him to let go his hold!","It brought away captive, as prisoners taken by force of arms, some of the most valiant of his army.","It fetched back from, as it were, the confines of hell, some of those that were his most trusty, and that, with hell, had been at an agreement.","It made them come and confess their deeds, and burn their books before all men.","'So mightily grew the Word of God, and prevailed.'","Thus, therefore, you see why Christ will have offered mercy, in the first place, to the biggest sinners; they have most need thereof; and this is the most ready way to extol his name 'that rideth upon the heavens' to our help.","But, Third, Christ Jesus would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, because, by their forgiveness and salvation, others, hearing of it, will be encouraged the more to come to him for life.","For the physician, by curing the most desperate at the first, doth not only get himself a name, but begets encouragement in the minds of other diseased folk to come to him for help.","Hence you read of our Lord, that after, through his tender mercy, he had cured many of great diseases, his fame was spread abroad: 'They brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy, and he healed them.","And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and from beyond Jordan' (Matt 4:24,25).","See here, he first, by working, gets himself a fame, a name, and renown; and now men take encouragement, and bring, from all quarters, their diseased to him, being helped, by what they had heard, to believe that their diseased should be healed.","Now, as he did with those outward cures, so he does in the proffers of his grace and mercy; he proffers that, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, that others may take heart to come to him to be saved.",I will give you a scripture or two.,"I mean to show you that Christ, by commanding that his mercy should, in the first place, be offered to the biggest of sinners, has a design thereby to encourage and provoke others to come also to him for mercy.","'God,' said Paul, 'who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ (by grace ye are saved); and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.'",But why did he do all this?,'That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus' (Eph 2:4-7).,"See, here is a design; God lets out his mercy to Ephesus of design, even to show to the ages to come the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness to them through Christ Jesus.","And why, to show, by these, the exceeding riches of his grace to the ages to come, through Christ Jesus?","But to allure them, and their children also to come to him, and to partake the same grace through Christ Jesus?13 But what was Paul, and the Ephesian sinners?",(of Paul we will speak anon.),"These Ephesian sinners, they were men dead in sins; men that walked according to the dictates and motions of the devil; worshippers of Diana, that effeminate goddess; men far off from God, aliens and strangers to all good things; such as were far off from that, as I said, and, consequently, in a most deplorable condition.","As the Jerusalem sinners were of the highest sort among the Jews, so these Ephesian sinners were of the highest sort among the Gentiles (Eph 2:1-3,11,12; Acts 19:35).","Wherefore, as by the Jerusalem sinners, in saving them first, he had a design to provoke others to come to him for mercy, so the same design is here set on foot again, in his calling and converting the Ephesian sinners, 'That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace,' says he, 'in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus.'",There is yet one hint behind.,"It is said that God saved these 'for his great love'; that is, as I think, for the setting forth, for the commendation of his love, for the advance of his love, in the hearts and minds of them that should come after.","As who should say, God has had mercy upon, and been gracious to you, that he might show to others, for their encouragement, that they have ground to come to him to be saved.","When God saves one great sinner, it is to encourage another great sinner to come to him for mercy.","He saved the thief, to encourage thieves to come to him for mercy; he saved Magdalene, to encourage other Magdalenes to come to him for mercy; he saved Saul, to encourage Sauls to come to him for mercy; and this Paul himself doth say, 'For this cause,' saith he, 'I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting' (1 Tim 1:16).",How plain are the words!,"Christ, in saving of me, has given to the world a pattern of his grace, that they might see, and believe, and come, and be saved; that they that are to be born hereafter might believe on Jesus Christ to life everlasting.",But what was Paul?,"Why, he tells you himself; I am, says he, the chief of sinners.","I was, says he, a blasphemer, a persecutor, an injurious person; but I obtained mercy (1 Tim 1:13,14).","Ay, that is well for you, Paul; but what advantage have we thereby?","Oh, very much, saith he; for, 'for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting' (verse 16).","Thus, therefore, you see that this third reason is of strength; namely, that Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, because, by their forgiveness and salvation, others, hearing of it, will be encouraged the more to come to him for mercy.","It may well, therefore, be said to God, Thou delightest in mercy, and mercy pleases thee (Micah 7:18).","But who believes that this was God's design in showing mercy of old--namely, that we that come after might take courage to come to him for mercy; or that Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, to stir up others to come to him for life?","This is not the manner of men, O God!","But David saw this betimes; therefore he makes this one argument with God, that he would blot out his transgressions, that he would forgive his adultery, his murders, and horrible hypocrisy.","Do it, O Lord, saith he, do it, and 'then will I teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto thee' (Psa 2:7-13).","He knew that the conversion of sinners would be a work highly pleasing to God, as being that which he had designed before he made mountain or hill: wherefore he comes, and he saith, Save me, O Lord; if thou wilt but save me, I will fall in with thy design; I will help to bring what sinners to thee I can.","And, Lord, I am willing to be made a preacher myself, for that I have been a horrible sinner; wherefore, if thou shalt forgive my great transgressions, I shall be a fit man to tell of thy wondrous grace to others.","Yea, Lord, I dare promise, that if thou wilt have mercy upon me, it shall tend to the glory of thy grace, and also to the increase of thy kingdom; for I will tell it, and sinners will hear on't.",And there is nothing so suiteth with the hearing sinner as mercy; and to be informed that God is willing to bestow it upon him.,'I will teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.',"Nor will Christ Jesus miss of his design in proffering of mercy, in the first place, to the biggest sinners.","You know what work the Lord, by laying hold of the woman of Samaria, made among the people there.","They knew that she was a town sinner, an adulteress; yea, one that, after the most audacious manner, lived in uncleanness with a man that was not her husband.","But when she, from a turn upon her heart, went into the city, and said to her neighbours, 'Come,' Oh, how they came!",how they flocked out of the city to Jesus Christ!,"'Then they went out of the city, and came to him.'","'And many of the Samaritans of that city (people, perhaps, as bad as herself) believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did' (John 4:39).","That word, 'He told me all that ever I did,' was a great argument with them; for by that they gathered, that though he knew her to be vile, yet he did not despise her, nor refuse to show how willing he was to communicate his grace unto her; and this fetched over, first her, then them.","This woman, as I said, was a Samaritan sinner, a sinner of the worst complexion; for the Jews abhorred to have ought to do with them (verse 9), wherefore none more fit than she to be made one of the decoys of heaven, to bring others of these Samaritan wild-fowls under the net of the grace of Christ; and she did the work to purpose.","Many, and many more of the Samaritans believed on him (verse 40-42).","The heart of man, though set on sin, will, when it comes once to a persuasion that God is willing to have mercy upon us, incline to come to Jesus Christ for life.","Witness those turn-aways from God that you also read of in Jeremiah; for after they had heard, three or four times over, that God had mercy for backsliders, they broke out, and said, 'Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the Lord our God.'","(Jer 3:22); or, as those in Hosea did, 'For in thee the fatherless findeth mercy' (Hosea 14:1-3).","Mercy, and the revelation thereof, is the only antidote against sin.","'Tis of a thawing nature; 'twill loose the heart that is frozen up in sin; yea, 'twill make the unwilling willing to come to Jesus Christ for life.","Wherefore, do you think, was it that Jesus Christ told the adulterous woman, and that before so many sinners, that he had not condemned her, but to allure her, with them there present, to hope to find favour at his hands?","As he also saith, in another place, 'I came not to judge, but to save the world.'","For might they not thence most rationally conclude, that if Jesus Christ had rather save than damn an harlot, there was encouragement for them [although great sinners] to come to him for mercy.","I heard once a story from a soldier, who, with his company, had laid siege against a fort, that so long as the besieged were persuaded their foes would show them no favour, they fought like madmen; but when they saw one of their fellows taken, and received to favour, they all came tumbling down from their fortress, and delivered themselves into their enemies' hands.","I am persuaded, did men believe that there is that grace and willingness in the heart of Christ to save sinners, as the Word imports there is, they would come tumbling into his arms: but Satan has blinded their minds that they cannot see this thing.","Howbeit, the Lord Jesus has, as I said, that others might take heart and come to him, given out a commandment, that mercy should, in the first place, be offered to the biggest sinners.","'Begin,' saith he, 'at Jerusalem'; and thus I end the third reason.","Fourth, Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in the first place, to biggest sinners, because that is the way, if they receive it, most to weaken the kingdom of Satan, and to keep it lowest in every age of the world.","The biggest sinners, they are Satan's colonels and captains, the leaders of his people, and they that most stoutly make head against the Son of God.","Wherefore, let these first be conquered, and his kingdom will be weak.","When Ishbosheth had lost his Abner, the kingdom was made weak, nor did he sit but tottering then upon his throne.","So, when Satan loseth his strong men, them that are mighty to work iniquity, and dexterous to manage others in the same, then is his kingdom weak (2 Sam 3).","Therefore, I say, Christ, and doth offer mercy, in the first place, to such, the more to weaken his kingdom.","Christ Jesus was glad to see Satan fall like lightning from heaven; that is, suddenly, or head-long; and it was, surely, by casting of him out of strong possession, and by recovering of some notorious sinners out of his clutches (Luke 10:17-19).","Samson, when he would pull down the Philistines' temple, took hold of the two main pillars of it, and, breaking them, down came the house.","Christ came to destroy the works of the devil, and to destroy by converting grace, as well as by redeeming blood.","Now, sin swarms, and lieth by legions, and whole armies, in the souls of the biggest sinners, as in garrisons;14 wherefore, the way, the most direct way, to destroy it, is first to deal with such sinners by the word of his gospel, and by the merits of his passion.","For example, though I shall give you but a homely one; suppose a family to be very lousy, and one or two of the family to be in chief the breeders, the way, the quickest way, to clean that family, or at least to weaken the so swarming of those vermin, is, in the first place, to sweeten the skin, head, and clothes of the chief breeders; and then, though all the family should be apt to breed them, the number of them, and so the greatness of that plague there, will be the more impaired.","Why, there are some people that are in chief the devil's sin-breeders in the towns and places where they live.","The place, town, or family where they live, must needs be horribly lousy, and, as it were, eaten up with vermin.","Now, let the Lord Jesus, in the first place, cleanse these great breeders, and there will be given a nip to those swarms of sins that used to be committed in such places throughout the town, house, or family, where such sin-breeding persons used to be.",I speak by experience.,"I was one of these lousy ones, one of these great sin-breeders; I infected all the youth of the town where I was born, with all manner of youthful vanities.","The neighbours counted me so; my practice proved me so: wherefore Christ Jesus took me first; and taking me first, the contagion was much allayed all the town over.","When God made me sigh, they would hearken, and inquiringly say, What's the matter with John?","They also gave their various opinions of me; but, as I said, sin cooled, and failed, as to his full career.","When I went out to seek the bread of life, some of them would follow, and the rest be put into a muse 15 at home.","Yea, almost the town, at first, at times would go out to hear at the place where I found good; yea, young and old for a while had some reformation on them; also some of them, perceiving that God had mercy upon me, came crying to him for mercy too.",But what need I give you an instance of poor I; I will come to Manasseh the king.,"So long as he was a ringleading sinner, the great idolater, and chief for devilism, the whole land flowed with wickedness; for he made them to sin (2 Chron 33), and do worse than the heathen that dwelt round about them, or that was cast out from before them: but when God converted him, the whole land was reformed.","Down went the groves, the idols, and altars of Baal, and up went true religion in much of the power and purity of it.","You will say, The king reformed by power.","I answer, doubtless, and by example too; for people observe their leaders; as their fathers did, so did they (2 Kings 17:41).","This, therefore, is another reason why Jesus would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, because that is the best way, if they receive it, most to weaken the kingdom of Satan, and to keep it poor and low.","And do you not think now, that if God would but take hold of the hearts of some of the most notorious in your town, in your family, or country, that this thing would be verified before your faces?","It would, it would, to the joy of you that are godly, to the making of hell to sigh, to the great suppressing of sin, the glory of Christ, and the joy of the angels of God.16 And ministers, should, therefore, that this work might go on, take advantages to persuade with the biggest sinners to come into Christ, according to my text, and their commission, 'Beginning at Jerusalem.'","Fifth, Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, because such, when converted, are usually the best helps in the church against temptations, and fittest for the support of the feeble-minded there.","Hence, usually, you have some such in the first plantation of churches, or quickly upon it.","Churches would do but sorrily, if Christ Jesus did not put such converts among them; they are the monuments and mirrors of mercy.","The very sight of such a sinner in God's house, yea, the very thought of him, where the sight of him cannot be had, is ofttimes greatly for the help of the faith of the feeble.","When the churches, saith Paul, that were in Judea, heard this concerning me, that he which persecuted them in time past, now preached the faith which once he destroyed, 'they glorified God in me' (Gal 1:20-24).",'Glorified God.',How is that?,"Why, they praised him, and took courage to believe the more in the mercy of God; for that he had had mercy on such a great sinner as he.","They glorified God 'in me'; they wondered that grace should be so rich, as to take hold of such a wretch as I was; and for my sake believed in Christ the more.","There are two things that great sinners are acquainted with, when they come to divulge them to the saints, that are a great relief to their faith.",1.,The contests that they usually have with the devil at their parting with him.,2.,Their knowledge of his secrets in his workings.,1.,"For first, The biggest sinners17 have usually great contests with the devil at their partings; and this is an help to saints: for ordinary saints find afterwards what the vile ones find at first, but when, at the opening of hearts, the one finds himself to be as the other--the one is a comfort to the other.","The lesser sort of sinners find but little of this, till after they have been some time in profession; but the vile man meets with his at the beginning.","Wherefore he, when the other is down, is ready to tell that he has met with the same before; for, I say, he has had it before.",Satan is loath to part with a great sinner.,"'What, my true servant,' quoth he, 'my old servant, wilt thou forsake me now?","Having so often sold thyself to me to work wickedness, wilt thou forsake me now?","Thou horrible wretch, dost not know, that thou has sinned thyself beyond the reach of grace, and dost thou think to find mercy now?","Art not thou a murderer, a thief, a harlot, a witch, a sinner of the greatest size, and dost thou look for mercy now?",Dost thou think that Christ will foul his fingers with thee?,"It is enough to make angels blush, saith Satan, to see so vile an one knock at heaven-gates for mercy, and wilt thou be so abominably bold to do it?'","18 Thus Satan dealt with me, says the great sinner, when at first I came to Jesus Christ.",And what did you reply?,saith the tempted.,"Why, I granted the while charge to be true, says the other.","And what, did you despair, or how?","No, saith he, I said, I am Magdalene, I am Zaccheus, I am the thief, I am the harlot, I am the publican, I am the prodigal, and one of Christ's murderers; yea, worse than any of these; and yet God was so far off from rejecting of me, as I found afterwards, that there was music and dancing in his house for me, and for joy that I was come home unto him.","O blessed be God for grace (says the other), for then, I hope, there is favour for me.","Yea, as I told you, such an one is a continual spectacle in the church, for every one by to behold God's grace and wonder by.",2.,"And as for the secrets of Satan, such as are suggestions to question the being of God, the truth of his Word, and to be annoyed with devilish blasphemies; none more acquainted with these than the biggest sinners at their conversion; wherefore thus also they are prepared to be helps in the church to relieve and comfort the other.","I might also here tell you of the contests and battles that such are engaged in, wherein they find the buffetings of Satan, above any other of the saints.","At which time Satan assaults the soul with darkness, fears, frightful thoughts of apparitions; now they sweat, pant, cry out, and struggle for life.","The angels now come down to behold the sight, and rejoice to see a bit of dust and ashes to overcome principalities and powers, and might, and dominions.","But, as I said, when these come a little to be settled, they are prepared for helps for others, and are great comforts unto them.",Their great sins give encouragement to the devil to assault them; and by these temptations Christ takes advantage to make them the more helpful to the churches.,"The biggest sinner, when he is converted, and comes into the church, says to them all, by his very coming in, Behold me, all you that are men and women of a low and timorous spirit, you whose hearts are narrow, for that you never had the advantage to know, because your sins are few, the largeness of the grace of God.","Behold, I say, in me, the exceeding riches of his grace!","I am a pattern set forth before your faces, on whom you may look and take heart.","This, I say, the great sinner can say, to the exceeding comfort of all the rest.","Wherefore, as I have hinted before, when God intends to stock a place with saints, and to make that place excellently to flourish with the riches of his grace, he usually begins with the conversion of some of the most notorious thereabouts, and lays them, as an example, to allure others, and to build up when they are converted.","It was Paul that must go to the Gentiles, because Paul was the most outrageous of all the apostles, in the time of his unregeneracy.","Yea, Peter must be he, that after his horrible fall, was thought fittest, when recovered again, to comfort and strengthen his brethren (See Luke 22:31,32).","Some must be pillars in God's house; and if they be pillars of cedar, they must stand while they are stout and sturdy sticks in the forest, before they are cut down, and planted or placed there.","No man, when he buildeth his house, makes the principal parts thereof of weak or feeble timber; for how could such bear up the rest?",but of great and able wood.,Christ Jesus also goeth this way to work; he makes of the biggest sinners bearers and supporters to the rest.,"This, then, may serve for another reason, why Jesus Christ gives out in commandment, that mercy should, in the first place, be offered to the biggest sinners, because such, when converted, are usually the best helps in the church against temptations, and fittest for the support of the feeble-minded there.","Sixth, Another reason why Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, is, because they, when converted, are apt to love him most.",This agrees both with scripture and reason.,Scripture says so.,"To whom much is forgiven, the same loveth much.","'To whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little' (Luke 7:47).","Reason says so: for as it would be the unreasonablest thing in the world to render hatred for love, and contempt for forgiveness; so it would be as ridiculous to think, that the reception of a little kindness should lay the same obligations upon the heart to love as the reception of a great deal.","I would not disparage the love of Christ; I know the least drachm of it, when it reaches to forgiveness, is great above all the world; but comparatively, there are greater extensions of the love of Christ to one than to another.","He that has most sin, if.","forgiven, is partaker of the greatest love, of the greatest forgiveness.","I know also, that there are some, that from this very doctrine say, 'Let us do evil that good may come'; and that turn the grace of our God into lasciviousness.",But I speak not of these; these will neither be ruled by grace nor reason.,"Grace would teach them, if they knew it, to deny ungodly courses; and so would reason too, if it could truly sense the love of God (Titus 2:11,12; Rom 12:1).","Doth it look like what hath any coherence with reason or mercy, for a man to abuse his friend?","Because Christ died for me, shall I therefore spit in his face?","The bread and water that was given by Elisha to his enemies, that came into the land of Israel to take him, had so much influence upon their minds, though heathens, that they returned to their homes without hurting him; yea, it kept them from coming again in a hostile manner into the coasts of Israel (2 Kings 6:19-23).","But to forbear to illustrate, till anon.","One reason why Christ Jesus shows mercy to sinners, is, that he might obtain their love, that he may remove their base affections from base objects to himself.","Now, if he loves to be loved a little, he loves to be loved much; but there is not any that are capable of loving much, save those that have much forgiven them.","Hence it is said of Paul, that he laboured more than them all; to wit, with a labour of love, because he had been by sin more vile against Christ than they all (1 Cor 15).","He it was that 'persecuted the church of God, and wasted it' (Gal 1:13).",He of them all was the only raving bedlam against the saints.,"'And being exceeding mad,' says he, 'against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities' (Acts 26:11).","This raving bedlam, that once was so, is he that now says, I laboured more than them all, more for Christ than them all.","But Paul, what moved thee thus to do?","The love of Christ, says he.","It was not I, but the grace of God that was with me.","As who should say, O grace!",It was such grace to save me!,"It was such marvellous grace for God to look down from heaven upon me, and that secured me from the wrath to come, that I am captivated with the sense of the riches of it.","Hence I act, hence I labour; for how can I otherwise do, since God not only separated me from my sins and companions, but separated all the powers of my soul and body to his service?","I am, therefore, prompted on by this exceeding love to labour as I have done; yet not I, but the grace of God with me.",Oh!,"I shall never forget his love, nor the circumstances under which I was, when his love laid hold upon me.","I was going to Damascus with letters from the high-priest, to make havoc of God's people there, as I had made havoc of them in other places.",These bloody letters were not imposed upon me.,"I went to the high-priest and desired them of him, and yet he saved me!","(Acts 9:1,2).","I was one of the men, of the chief men, that had a hand in the blood of his martyr Stephen; yet he had mercy upon me!","When I was at Damascus, I stunk19 so horribly like a blood-sucker, that I became a terror to all thereabout.","Yea, Ananias, good man, made intercession to my Lord against me; yet he would have mercy upon me, yea, joined mercy to mercy, until he had made me a monument of grace.","He made a saint of me, and persuaded me that my transgressions were forgiven me.","When I began to preach, those that heard me were amazed, and said, 'Is not this he that destroyed them that called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the high-priest?'","Hell doth know that I was a sinner; heaven doth know that I was a sinner; the world also knows that I was a sinner, a sinner of the greatest size; but I obtained mercy (Acts 9:20,21).",Shall not this lay obligation upon me?,Is not love of the greatest force to oblige?,"Is it not strong as death, cruel as the grave, and hotter than the coals of juniper?",Hath it not a most vehement flame?,Can the waters quench it?,can the floods drown it?,"I a m under the force of it, and this is my continual cry, What shall I render to the Lord for all the benefits which he has bestowed upon me?","Aye, Paul!","this is something; thou speakest like a man, like a man affected, and carried away with the love and grace of God.","Now, this sense, and this affection, and this labour, giveth to Christ the love that he looks for.","But he might have converted twenty little sinners, and yet not found, for grace bestowed, so much love in them all.","I wonder how far a man might go among the converted sinners of the smaller size, before he could find one that so much as looked anything this way ward.",Where is he that is thus under pangs of love for the grace bestowed upon him by Jesus Christ?,"Excepting only some few, you may walk to the world's end, and find none.","But, as I said, some there are, and so there have been in every age of the church, great sinners, that have had much forgiven them; and they love much upon this account.","Jesus Christ, therefore, knows what he doth, when he lays hold on the hearts of sinners of the biggest size.",He knows that such an one will love more than many that have not sinned half their sins.,"I will tell you a story that I have read of Martha and Mary; the name of the book I have forgot; I mean of the book in which I found the relation; but the thing was thus:-- Martha, saith my author, was a very holy woman, much like Lazarus, her brother; but Mary was a loose and wanton creature; Martha did seldom miss good sermons and lectures, when she could come at them in Jerusalem; but Mary would frequent the house of sports, and the company of the vilest of men for lust.","And though Martha had often desired that her sister would go with her to hear her preachers, yea, had often entreated her with tears to do it, yet could she never prevail; for still Mary would make her excuse, or reject her with disdain, for her zeal and preciseness in religion.","After Martha had waited long, tried many ways to bring her sister to good, and all proved ineffectual, at last she comes upon her thus: 'Sister,' quoth she, 'I pray thee go with me to the temple today, to hear one preach a sermon.'",'What kind of preacher is he?',said she.,"Martha replied, 'It is one Jesus of Nazareth; he is the handsomest man that ever you saw with your eyes.",Oh!,"he shines in beauty, and is a most excellent preacher.'","Now, what does Mary, after a little pause, but goes up into her chamber, and, with her pins and her clouts,20 decks up herself as fine as her fingers could make her.","This done, away she goes, not with her sister Martha, but as much unobserved as she could, to the sermon, or rather to see the preacher.","The hour and preacher being come, and she having observed whereabout the preacher would stand, goes and sets herself so in the temple, that she might be sure to have the full view of this excellent person.","So he comes in, and she looks, and the first glimpse of his person pleased her.","Well, Jesus addresseth himself to his sermon, and she looks earnestly on him.","Now, at that time, saith my author, Jesus preached about the lost sheep, the lost groat, and the prodigal child.","And when he came to show what care the shepherd took for one lost sheep, and how the woman swept to find her piece which was lost, and what joy there was at their finding, she began to be taken by the ears, and forgot what she came about, musing what the preacher would make of it.","But when he came to the application, and showed, that by the lost sheep, was meant a great sinner; by the shepherd's care, was meant God's love for great sinners; and that by the joy of the neighbours, was showed what joy there was among the angels in heaven over one great sinner that repenteth; she began to be taken by the heart.","And as he spake these last words, she thought he pitched his innocent eyes just upon her, and looked as if he spake what was now said to her: wherefore her heart began to tremble, being shaken with affection and fear; then her eyes ran down with tears apace; wherefore she was forced to hide her face with her handkerchief, and so sat sobbing and crying all the rest of the sermon.","Sermon being done, up she gets, and away she goes, and withal inquired where this Jesus the preacher dined that day?","and one told her, At the house of Simon the Pharisee.","So away goes she, first to her chamber, and there strips herself of her wanton attire; then falls upon her knees to ask God forgiveness for all her wicked life.","This done, in a modest dress she goes to Simon's house, where she finds Jesus sat at dinner.","So she gets behind him, and weeps, and drops her tears upon his feet like rain, and washes them, and wipes them with the hair of her head.","She also kissed his feet with her lips, and anointed them with ointment.","When Simon the Pharisee perceived what the woman did, and being ignorant of what it was to be forgiven much (for he never was forgiven more than fifty pence), he began to think within himself, that he had been mistaken about Jesus Christ, because he suffered such a sinner as this woman was, to touch him.","Surely, quoth he, this man, if he were a prophet, would not let this woman come near him, for she is a town-sinner; so ignorant are all self-righteous men of the way of Christ with sinners.","But, lest Mary should be discouraged with some clownish carriage of this Pharisee, and so desert her good beginnings, and her new steps which she now had begun to take towards eternal life, Jesus began thus with Simon: 'Simon,' saith he, 'I have somewhat to say unto thee.","And he saith, Master, say on.","There was,' said Jesus, 'a certain creditor which had two debtors; the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.","And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.","Tell me, therefore, which of them will love him most?","Simon answered, and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.","And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.","And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman?","I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.","Thou gavest me no kiss; but this woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.","My head with oil thou didst not anoint, but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.","Wherefore, I say unto her, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.","And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven'(Luke 7:36-48).",Thus you have the story.,"If I come short in any circumstance, I beg pardon of those that can correct me.","It is three or four and twenty years since I saw the book; yet I have, as far as my memory will admit, given you the relation of the matter.","However, Luke, as you see, doth here present you with the substance of the whole.21 Alas!",Christ Jesus has but little thanks for the saving of little sinners.,"'To whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.'","He gets not water for his feet, by his saving of such sinners.","There are abundance of dry-eyed Christians in the world, and abundance of dry-eyed duties too; duties that never were wetted with the tears of contrition and repentance, nor ever sweetened with the great sinner's box of ointment.","And the reason is, such sinners have not great sins to be saved from; or, if they have, they look upon them in the diminishing glass of the holy law of God.22 But, I rather believe, that the professors of our days want a due sense of what they are; for, verily, for the generality of them, both before and since conversion, they have been sinners of a lusty size.","But if their eyes be holden, if convictions are not shown, if their knowledge of their sins is but like to the eye-sight in twilight; the heart cannot be affected with that grace that has laid hold on the man; and so Christ Jesus sows much, and has little coming in.","Wherefore his way is ofttimes to step out of the way, to Jericho, to Samaria, to the country of the Gadarenes, to the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, and also to Mount Calvary, that he may lay hold of such kind of sinners as will love him to his liking (Luke 19:1-11; John 4:3-11; Mark 5:1-20; Matt 15:21-29; Luke 23:33-43).","But thus much for the sixth reason, why Christ Jesus would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, to wit, because such sinners, when converted, are apt to love him most.","The Jerusalem sinners were they that outstripped, when they were converted, in some things, all the churches of the Gentiles.","They 'were of one heart, and of one soul: neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own.'","'Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles' feet,' &c. (Acts 4:32,35).","Now, show me such another pattern, if you can.",But why did these do thus?,Oh!,they were Jerusalem sinners.,"These were the men that, but a little before, had killed the Prince of life; and those to whom he did, that notwithstanding, send the first offer of grace and mercy.","And the sense of this took them up betwixt the earth and the heaven, and carried them on in such ways and methods as could never be trodden by any since.","They talk of the church of Rome, and set her, in her primitive state, as a pattern and mother of churches; when the truth is, they were the Jerusalem sinners, when converts, that out-did all the churches that ever were.","Seventh, Christ Jesus would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, because grace, when it is received by such, finds matter to kindle upon more freely than it finds in other sinners.","Great sinners are like the dry wood, or like great candles, which burn best and shine with biggest light.","I lay not this down, as I did those reasons before, to show, that when great sinners are converted, they will be encouragement to others, though that is true; but to show, that Christ has a delight to see grace, the grace we receive, to shine.","We love to see things that bear a good gloss; yea, we choose to buy such kind of matter to work upon, as will, if wrought up to what we intend, cast that lustre that we desire.","Candles that burn not bright, we like not; wood that is green will rather smother, and sputter, and smoke, and crack, and flounce, than cast a brave light and a pleasant heat; wherefore great folks care not much, not so much, for such kind of things, as for them that will better answer their ends.","Hence Christ desires the biggest sinner; in him there is matter to work by, to wit, a great deal of sin; for as by the tallow of the candle, the first takes occasion to burn the brighter; so, by the sin of the soul, grace takes occasion to shine the clearer.","Little candles shine but little, for there wanteth matter for the fire to work upon; but in the great sinner, here is more matter for grace to work by.","Faith shines, when it worketh towards Christ, through the sides of many and great transgressions, and so does love, for that much is forgiven.","And what matter can be found in the soul for humility to work by so well, as by a sight that I have been and am an abominable sinner?","And the same is to be said of patience, meekness, gentleness, self-denial, or of any other grace.","Grace takes occasion, by the vileness of the man, to shine the more; even as by the ruggedness of a very strong distemper or disease, the virtue of the medicine is best made manifest.","'Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound' (Rom 5:20).",A black string makes the neck look whiter; great sins make grace burn clear.,"Some say, when grace and a good nature meet together, they do make shining Christians; but I say, when grace and a great sinner meet, and when grace shall subdue that great sinner to itself, and shall operate after its kind in the soul of that great sinner, then we have a shining Christian; witness all those of whom mention was made before.","Abraham was among the idolaters when in the land of Assyria, and served idols, with his kindred, on the other side of the flood (Josh 24:2; Gen 11:31).","But who, when called, was there in the world, in whom grace shone so bright as in him?","The Thessalonians were idolaters before the Word of God came to them; but when they had received it, they became examples to all that did believe in Macedonia and Achaia (1 Thess 1:6-10).","God the Father, and Jesus Christ his Son, are for having things seen; for having the Word of life held forth.","They light not a candle that it might be put under a bushel, or under a bed, but on a candlestick, that all that come in may see the light (Matt 5:15; Mark 4:21; Luke 8:16; 11:33).","and, I say, as I said before, in whom is it, light, like so to shine, as in the souls of great sinners?","When the Jewish Pharisees dallied with the gospel, Christ threatened to take it from them, and to give it to the barbarous heathens and idolaters.",Why so?,"For they, saith he, will bring forth the fruits thereof in their season.","23 'Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof' (Matt 21:43).","I have often marvelled at our youth, and said in my heart, What should be the reason that they should be so generally at this day debauched as they are?","For they are now profane to amazement; and sometimes I have thought one thing, and sometimes another; that is, why God should suffer it so to be?","At last I have thought of this: How if the God, whose ways are past finding out, should suffer it so to be now, that he might make of some of them the more glorious saints hereafter.","I know sin is of the devil, but it cannot work in the world without permission: and if it happens to be as I have thought, it will not be the first time that God the Lord hath caught Satan in his own design.","For my part, I believe that the time is at hand, that we shall see better saints in the world than has been seen in it this many a day.","And this vileness, that at present does so much swallow up our youth, is one cause of my thinking so; for out of them, for from among them, when God sets to his hand, as of old, you shall see what penitent ones, what trembling ones, and what admirers of grace, will be found to profess the gospel to the glory of God by Christ.",Alas!,"we are a company of worn-out Christians; our moon is in the wane; we are much more black than white, more dark than light; we shine but a little; grace in the most of us is decayed.","But I say, when they of these debauched ones that are to be saved shall be brought in--when these that look more like devils than men shall be converted to Christ (and I believe several of them will), then will Christ be exalted, grace adored, the Word prized, Zion's path better trodden, and men in the pursuit of their own salvation, to the amazement of them that are left behind.","Just before Christ came into the flesh, the world was degenerated as it is now: the generality of the men in Jerusalem were become either high and famous for hypocrisy, or filthy, base in their lives.","The devil also was broke loose in hideous manner, and had taken possession of many: yea, I believe, that there was never generation before nor since, that could produce so many possessed with devils, deformed, lame, blind, and infected with monstrous diseases, as that generation could.","But what was the reason thereof, I mean the reason from God?","Why, one--and we may sum up more in that answer that Christ gave to his disciples concerning him that was born blind--was, that 'the works of God should be made manifest' in them, and 'that the Son of God might be glorified thereby' (John 9:2,3; 11:4).","Now, if these devils and diseases, as they possessed men then, were to make way and work for an approaching to Christ in person, and for the declaring of his power, why may we not think that now, even now also, he is ready to come, by his Spirit in the gospel, to heal many of the debaucheries of our age?","I cannot believe that grace will take them all, for there are but few that are saved; but yet it will take some, even some of the worst of men, and make blessed ones of them.","But, O how these ringleaders in vice will then shine in virtue!","They will be the very pillars in churches, they will be as an ensign in the land.","'The Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land' (Zech 9:16).",But who are these?,"Even idolatrous Ephraim, and backsliding Judah (verse 13).","I know there is ground to fear, that the iniquity of this generation will be pursued with heavy judgments; but that will not hinder that we have supposed.","God took him a glorious church out of bloody Jerusalem, yea, out of the chief of the sinners there, and left the rest to be taken and spoiled, and sold, thirty for a penny, in the nations where they were captives.","The gospel working gloriously in a place, to the seizing upon many of the ringleading sinners thereof, promiseth no security to the rest, but rather threateneth them with the heaviest and smartest judgments; as in the instance now given, we have a full demonstration; but in defending, the Lord will defend his people; and in saving, he will save his inheritance.","Nor does this speak any great comfort to a decayed and backsliding sort of Christian; for the next time God rides post with his gospel, he will leave such Christians behind him.","But, I say, Christ is resolved to set up his light in the world; yea, he is delighted to see his graces shine; and therefore he commands that his gospel should, to that end, be offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners; for by great sins it shineth most; therefore he saith, 'Begin at Jerusalem.'","Eighth, and lastly, Christ Jesus will have mercy to be offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, for that by that means the impenitent that are left behind will be, at the judgment, the more left withoutexcuse.",God's Word has two edges; it can cut back-stroke and fore-stroke.,"If it doth thee no good, it will do thee hurt; it is 'the savour of life unto life' to those that receive it, but of 'death unto death' to them that refuse it (2 Cor 2:15,16).","But this is not all; the tender of grace to the biggest sinners, in the first place, will not only leave the rest, or those that refuse it, in a deplorable condition, but will also stop their mouths, and cut off all pretence to excuse at that day.","'If I had not come and spoken unto them,' saith Christ,' saith Christ, 'they had not had sin; but now they have no cloke for their sin'--for their sin of persevering in impenitence (John 15:22).",But what did he speak to them?,"Why, even that which I have told you; to wit, That he has in special a delight in saving the biggest sinners.","He spake this in the way of his doctrine; he spake this in the way of his practice, even to the pouring out of his last breath before them (Luke 23:34).","Now, since this is so, what can the condemned at the judgment say for themselves, why sentence of death should not be passed upon them?","I say, what excuse can they make for themselves, when they shall be asked why they did not in the day of salvation come to Christ to be saved?","Will they have ground to say to the Lord, Thou wast only for saving of little sinners; and, therefore, because they were great ones, they durst not come unto him; or that thou hadst not compassion for the biggest sinners, therefore I died in despair?","Will these be excuses for them, as the case now standeth with them?","Is there not everywhere in God's Book a flat contradiction to this, in multitudes of promises, of invitations, of examples, and the like?",Alas!,alas!,"there will then be there millions of souls to confute this plea; ready, I say, to stand up, and say, 'O!","deceived world, heaven swarms with such as were, when they were in the world, to the full as bad as you!'","Now, this will kill all plea or excuse, why they should not perish in their sins; yea, the text says they shall see them there.","'There shall be weeping-when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of heaven, and you yourselves thrust out.","And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God' (Luke 13:28,29).","Out of which company, it is easy to pick such as sometimes were as bad people as any [that] now breathe on the face of [the] earth.","What think you of the first man, by whose sins there are millions now in hell?","And so I may say, What think you of ten thousand more besides?",But if the Word will not stifle and gag them up--I speak now for amplification's sake--the view of those who are saved shall.,"There comes an incestuous person to the bar, and pleads, That the bigness of his sins was a bar to his receiving the promise.","But will not his mouth be stopped as to that, when Lot, and the incestuous Corinthians, shall be set before him (Gen 19:33-37; 1 Cor 5:1,2).","There comes a thief, and says, Lord, my sin of thefts, I thought, was such as could not be pardoned by thee!","But when he shall see the thief that was saved on the cross stand by, as clothed with beauteous glory, what further can he be able to object?","Yea, the Lord will produce ten thousand of his saints at his coming, who shall after this manner 'execute judgment upon all, and so convince all that are ungodly among them--of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him' (Jude 15).","And these are hard speeches against him, to say that he was not able or willing to save men, because of the greatness of their sins, or to say that they were discouraged by his Word from repentance, because of the heinousness of their offences.","These things, I say, shall then be confuted.","He comes with ten thousand of his saints to confute them, and to stop their mouths from making objections against their own eternal damnation.","Here is Adam, the destroyer of the world; here is Lot, that lay with both his daughters; here is Abraham, that was sometime an idolater; and Jacob, that was a supplanter; and Reuben, that lay with his father's concubine; and Judah, that lay with his daughter-in-law; and Levi and Simeon, that wickedly slew the Shechemites; and Aaron, that made an idol to be worshipped, and that proclaimed a religious feast unto it.","Here is also Rahab the harlot, and Bathsheba, that bare a bastard to David.","Here is Solomon, that great backslider; and Manasseh, that man of blood and a witch.","Time would fail to tell you of the woman of Canaan's daughter, of Mary Magdalene, of Matthew the publican, and of Gideon and Samson, and many thousands more.",Alas!,alas!,"I say, what will these sinners do, that have, through their unbelief, eclipsed the glorious largeness of the mercy of God, and gave way to despair of salvation, because of the bigness of their sins?","For all these, though now glorious saints in light, were sometimes sinners of the biggest size, who had sins that were of a notorious hue; yet now, I say, they are in their shining and heavenly robes before the throne of God and of the Lamb, blessing for ever and ever that Son of God for their salvation, who died for them upon the tree; admiring that ever it should come into their hearts once to think of coming to God by Christ; but above all, blessing God for granting of them light to see those encouragements in his Testament; without which, without doubt, they had been daunted, and sunk down under guilt of sin and despair, as their fellow-sinners have done.","But now they also are witnesses for God, and for his grace, against an unbelieving world; for, as I said, they shall come to convince the world of their speeches, their hard and unbelieving words, that they have spoken concerning the mercy of God, and the merits of the passion of his blessed Son, Jesus Christ.","But will it not, think you, strangely put to silence all such thoughts, and words, and reasons of the ungodly before the bar of God?","Doubtless it will; yea, and will send them away from his presence also, with the greatest guilt that possibly can fasten upon the consciences of men.","For what will sting like this?--'I have, through mine own foolish, narrow, unworthy, undervaluing thoughts, of the love and ability of Christ to save me, brought myself to everlasting ruin.","It is true, I was a horrible sinner; not one in a hundred did live so vile a life as I.",But this should not have kept me from closing with Jesus Christ.,"I see now that there are abundance in glory that once were as bad as I have been; but they were saved by faith, and I am damned by unbelief.",Wretch that I am!,why did not I give glory to the redeeming blood of Jesus?,Why did I not humbly cast my soul at his blessed footstool for mercy?,"Why did I judge of his ability to save me by the voice of my shallow reason, and the voice of a guilty conscience?",Why betook not I myself to the holy Word of God?,"Why did I not read and pray that I might understand, since now I perceive that God said then, He giveth liberally to them that pray, and upbraideth not' (James 1:5).","It is rational to think, that by such cogitations as these, the unbelieving world will be torn in pieces before the judgment of Christ; especially those that have lived where they did or might have heard the gospel of the grace of God.",Oh!,"that saying, 'It shall be more tolerable for Sodom at the judgment than for them,' will be better understood (Luke 10:8-12).","This reason, therefore, standeth fast; namely, that Christ, by offering mercy, in the first place, to the biggest sinners now, will stop all the mouths of the impenitent at the day of judgment, and cut off all excuse that shall be attempted to be made, from the thoughts of the greatness of their sins, why they came not to him.","I have often thought of the day of judgment, and how God will deal with sinners at that day; and I believe it will be managed with that sweetness, with that equitableness, with that excellent righteousness, as to every sin, and circumstance and aggravation thereof, that men that are damned, shall, before the judgment is over, receive such conviction of the righteous judgment of God upon them, and of their deserts of hell-fire, that they shall in themselves conclude, that there is all the reason in the world that they should be shut out of heaven, and go to hell-fire: 'These shall go away into everlasting punishment' (Matt 25:46).24 Only this will tear [them,] that they have missed of mercy and glory, and obtained everlasting damnation, through their unbelief; but it will tear but themselves, but their own souls; they will gnash upon themselves, for that mercy was offered to the chief of them in the first place, and yet they were damned for rejecting of it; they were damned for forsaking what they had a propriety in; for forsaking their own mercy.",And thus much for the reasons.,"Second, I will conclude with a word of application.",THE APPLICATION.,"First, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners?",Then this shows us how to make a right judgment of the heart of Christ to men.,"Indeed, we have advantage to guess at the goodness of his heart by many things; as by his taking our nature upon him, his dying for us, his sending his Word and ministers to us, and all that we might be saved.","But this of beginning to offer mercy to Jerusalem, is that which heightens all the rest; for this doth not only confirm to us, that love was the use of his dying for us, but it shows us yet more the depth of that love.","He might have died for us, and yet have extended the benefit of his death to a few, as one might call them, of the best-conditioned sinners, to those who, though they were weak, and so could not but sin, yet made not a trade of sinning; to those that sinned not lavishingly.","There are in the world, as one may call them, the moderate sinners; the sinners that mix righteousness with their pollutions; the sinners that, though they be sinners, do what on their part lies--some that are blind would think so--that they might be saved.","I say, it had been love, great love, if he had died for none but such, and sent his love to such; but that he should send out conditions of peace to the biggest of sinners; yea, that they should be offered to them first of all; (for so he means when he says, 'Begin at Jerusalem';) this is wonderful!","this shows his heart to purpose, as also the heart of God his Father, who sent him to do thus.","There is nothing more incident to men that are awake in their souls, than to have wrong thoughts of God--thoughts that are narrow, and that pinch and pen up his mercy to scanty and beggarly conclusions, and rigid legal conditions; supposing that it is rude, and an intrenching upon his majesty to come ourselves, or to invite others, until we have scraped and washed, and rubbed off as much of our dirt from us as we think is convenient, to make us somewhat orderly and handsome in his sight.25 Such never knew what these words meant, 'Begin at Jerusalem.'","Yea, such in their hearts have compared the Father and his Son to niggardly rich men, whose money comes from them like drops of blood.","True, say such, God has mercy, but he is loath to part with it; you must please him well, if you get any from him; he is not so free as many suppose, nor is he so willing to save as some pretended gospellers imagine.","But I ask such, if the Father and Son be not unspeakably free to show mercy, why was this clause put into our commission to preach the gospel?","Yea, why did he say, 'Begin at Jerusalem': for when men, through the weakness of their wits, have attempted to show other reasons why they would have the first proffer of mercy; yet I can prove, by many undeniable reasons, that they of Jerusalem, to whom the apostles made the first offer, according as they were commanded, were the biggest sinners that ever did breathe upon the face of God's earth (set the unpardonable sin aside); upon which [fact] my doctrine stands like a rock, that Jesus the Son of God would have mercy, in the first place, offered to the biggest sinners.","And if this doth not show the heart of the Father and the Son to be infinitely free in bestowing forgiveness of sins, I confess myself mistaken.","Neither is there, set this aside, another argument like it, to show us the willingness of Christ to save sinners; for, as was said before, all the rest of the signs of Christ's mercifulness might have been limited to sinners that are so and so qualified; but when he says, 'Begin at Jerusalem,' the line is stretched out to the utmost; no man can imagine beyond it; and it is folly here to pinch and spare, to narrow, and seek to bring it within scanty bounds; for he plainly saith, 'Begin at Jerusalem,' the biggest sinner is the biggest sinner; the biggest is the Jerusalem sinner.","It is true, he saith, that repentance and remission of sins must go together, but yet remission is sent to the chief, the Jerusalem sinner; nor doth repentance lessen at all the Jerusalem sinner's crimes; it diminisheth none of his sins, nor causes that there should be so much as half an one the fewer; it only puts a stop to the Jerusalem sinner's course, and makes him willing to be saved freely by grace; and for time to come to be governed by that blessed word that has brought the tidings of good things to him.","Besides, no man shows himself willing to be saved that repenteth not of his deeds; for he that goes on still in his trespasses, declares that he is resolved to pursue his own damnation further.","Learn then to judge of the largeness of God's heart, and of the heart of his Son Jesus Christ, by the Word; judge not thereof by feeling, nor by the reports of thy conscience; conscience is ofttimes here befooled, and made to go quite beside the Word.","It was judging without the Word that made David say, I am cast off from God's eyes, and 'shall perish one day by the hand of Saul' (Psa 31:22; 1 Sam 27:1).","The Word had told him another thing; namely, that he should be king in his stead.","Our text says also, that Jesus Christ bids preachers, in their preaching repentance and remission of sins, begin first at Jerusalem; thereby declaring most truly the infinite largeness of the merciful heart of God and his Son, to the sinful children of men.","Judge thou, I say, therefore, of the goodness of the heart of God and his Son, by this text, and by others of the same import; so shalt thou not dishonour the grace of God, nor needlessly fright thyself, nor give away thy faith, nor gratify the devil, nor lose the benefit of God's Word.",I speak now to weak believers.,"Second, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, to the Jerusalem sinners?","Then, by this also, you must learn to judge of the sufficiency of the merits of Christ; not that the merits of Christ can be comprehended, for that they are beyond the conceptions of the whole world, being called 'the unsearchable riches of Christ'; but yet they may be apprehended to a considerable degree.","Now, the way to apprehend them most, is, to consider what offers, after his resurrection, he makes of his grace to sinners; for to be sure he will not offer beyond the virtue of his merits; because, as grace is the cause of his merits, so his merits are the basis and bounds upon and by which his grace stands good, and is let out to sinners.","Doth he then command that his mercy should be offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners?","It declares, that there is a sufficiency in his blood to save the biggest sinners.",'The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin.',"And again, 'Be it known unto you, therefore, men and brethren, that through this man [this man's merits] is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins; and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses' (Acts 13:38).","Observe, then, thy rule to make judgment of the sufficiency of the blessed merits of thy Saviour.","If he had not been able to have reconciled the biggest sinners to his Father by his blood, he would not have sent to them, have sent to them in the first place, the doctrine of remission of sins; for remission of sins is through faith in his blood.","We are justified freely by the grace of God, through the redemption that is in the blood of Christ.","Upon the square, as I may call it, of the worthiness of the blood of Christ, grace acts, and offers forgiveness of sin to men (Eph 1:7; 2:13,14; Col 1:20-22).","Hence, therefore, we must gather, that the blood of Christ is of infinite value, for that he offereth mercy to the biggest of sinners.","Nay, further, since he offereth mercy, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, considering also, that this first act of his is that which the world will take notice of, and expect it should be continued unto the end.","Also it is a disparagement to a man that seeks his own glory in what he undertakes, to do that for a spurt, which he cannot continue and hold out in.","This is our Lord's own argument, He began to build, saith he, but was not able to finish (Luke 14:30).","Shouldst thou hear a man say, I am resolved to be kind to the poor, and should begin with giving handfuls of guineas, you would conclude, that either he is wonderful rich, or must straiten his hand, or will soon be at the bottom of his riches.","Why, this is the case: Christ, at his resurrection, gave it out that he would be good to the world; and first sends to the biggest sinners, with an intent to have mercy on them.","Now, the biggest sinners cannot be saved but by abundance of grace; it is not a little that will save great sinners (Rom 5:17).","And I say again, since the Lord Jesus mounts thus high at the first, and sends to the Jerusalem sinners, that they may come first to partake of his mercy, it follows, that either he has unsearchable riches of grace and worth in himself, or else he must straiten his hand, or his grace and merits will be spent before the world is at an end.","But let it be believed, as surely as spoken, he is still as full as ever.",He is not a jot the poorer for all the forgiveness tha the has given away to great sinners.,"Also he is still as free as at first; for he never yet called back this word, Begin at the Jerusalem sinners.","And, as I said, since his grace is extended according to the worth of his merits.","I conclude, that there is the same virtue in his merits to save now, as there was at the very beginning, Oh!",the riches of the grace of Christ!,Oh!,the riches of the blood of Christ!,"Third, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered in the first place to the biggest sinners?","Then here is encouragement for you that think, for wicked hearts and lives, you have not your fellows in the world, yet to come to him.","There is a people that therefore fear lest they should be rejected of Jesus Christ, because of the greatness of their sins; when, as you see here, such are sent to, sent to by Jesus Christ, to come to him for mercy: 'Begin at Jerusalem.'","Never did one thing answer another more fitly in this world, than this text fitteth such a kind of sinners.","As face answereth face in a glass, so this text answereth the necessities of such sinners.","What can a man say more, but that he stands in the rank of the biggest sinners?","let him stretch himself whither he can, and think of himself to the utmost, he can but conclude himself to be one of the biggest sinners.",And what then?,"Why, the text meets him in the very face, and saith, Christ offereth mercy to the biggest sinners, to the very Jerusalem sinners.",What more can be objected?,"Nay, he doth not only offer to such his mercy, but to them it is commanded to be offered in the first place: 'Begin at Jerusalem.'",'Preach repentance and remission of sins among all nations: beginning at Jerusalem.',"Is not here encouragement for those that think, for wicked hearts and lives, they have not their fellows in the world?",Objection.,But I have a heart as hard as a rock.,Answer.,"Well, but this doth but prove thee a biggest sinner.",Objection.,But my heart continually frets against the Lord.,Answer.,"Well, this doth but prove thee a biggest sinner.",Objection.,But I have been desperate in sinful courses.,Answer.,"Well, stand thou with the number of the biggest sinners.",Objection.,But my gray head is found in the way of wickedness.,Answer.,"Well, thou art in the rank of the biggest sinners.",Objection.,"But I have not only a base heart, but I have lived a debauched life.",Answer.,Stand thou also among those that are called the biggest sinners.,And what then?,"Why, the text swoops you all; you cannot object yourselves beyond the text.",It has a particular message to the biggest sinners.,"I say, it swoops you all.26 Objection.",But I am a reprobate.,Answer.,"Now thou talkest like a fool, and meddlest with what thou understandest not: no sin, but the sin of final impenitence, can prove a man a reprobate; and I am sure thou hast not arrived as yet unto that; therefore thou understandest not what thou sayest, and makest groundless conclusions against thyself.","Say thou art a sinner, and I will hold with thee; say thou art a great sinner, and I will say so too; yea, say thou art one of the biggest sinners, and spare not; for the text yet is beyond thee, is yet betwixt hell and thee; 'Begin at Jerusalem' has yet a smile upon thee; and thou talkest as if thou wast a reprobate, and that the greatness of thy sins do prove thee so to be, when yet they of Jerusalem were not such, whose sins, I dare say, were such, both for bigness and heinousness, as thou art not capable of committing beyond them; unless now, after thou hast received conviction that the Lord Jesus is the only Saviour of the world, thou shouldst wickedly and despitefully turn thyself from him, and conclude he is not to be trusted to for life, and so crucify him for a cheat afresh.","This, I must confess, will bring a man under the black rod, and set him in danger of eternal damnation (Heb 6:7,8; 10:8,9).","This is trampling under foot the Son of God, and counting his blood an unholy thing.","This did they of Jerusalem; but they did it ignorantly in unbelief, and so were yet capable of mercy; but to do this against professed light, and to stand to it, puts a man beyond the text indeed (Acts 3:14-17; 1 Tim 1:13).","But I say, what is this to him that would fain be saved by Christ?","His sins did, as to greatness, never yet reach to the nature of the sins that the sinners intended by the text had made themselves guilty of.","He that would be saved by Christ, has an honourable esteem of him; but they of Jerusalem preferred a murderer before him; and as for him, they cried, Away, away with him, it is not fit that he should live.","Perhaps thou wilt object, That thyself hast a thousand times preferred a stinking lust before him: I answer, Be it so; it is but what is common to men to do; nor doth the Lord Jesus make such a foolish life a bar to thee, to forbid thy coming to him, or a bond to his grace, that it might be kept from thee; but admits of thy repentance, and offereth himself unto thee freely, as thou standest among the Jerusalem sinners.","Take therefore encouragement, man; mercy is, by the text, held forth to the biggest sinners; yea, put thyself into the number of the worst, by reckoning that thou mayest be one of the first, and mayest not be put off till the biggest sinners are served; for the biggest sinners are first invited; consequently, if they come, they are like to be the first that shall be served.","It was so with Jerusalem; Jerusalem sinners were they that were first invited, and those of them that came first--and there came three thousand of them the first day they were invited; how many came afterwards none can tell--they were first served.","Put in thy name, man, among the biggest, lest thou art made to wait till they are served.","You have some men that think themselves very cunning, because they put up their names in their prayers among them that feign it, saying, God, I thank thee I am not so bad as the worst.","But believe it, if they be saved at all, they shall be saved in the last place.",The first in their own eyes shall be served last; and the last or worst shall be first.,"The text insinuates it, 'Begin at Jerusalem'; and reason backs it, for they have most need.","Behold ye, therefore, how God's ways are above ours; we are for serving the worst last, God is for serving the worst first.","The man at the pool, that to my thinking was longest in his disease, and most helpless as to his cure, was first healed; yea, he only was healed; for we read that Christ healed him, but we read not then that he healed one more there!",(John 5:1-10).,"Wherefore, if thou wouldst soonest be served, put in thy name among the very worst of sinners.","Say, when thou art upon thy knees, Lord, here is a Jerusalem sinner!",a sinner of the biggest size!,one whose burden is of the greatest bulk and heaviest weight!,"one that cannot stand long without sinking into hell, without thy supporting hand!","'Be not thou far from me, O Lord!","O my strength, haste thee to help me!'",(Psa 22:19).,"I say, put in thy name with Magdalene, with Manasseh, that thou mayest fare as the Magdalene and the Manasseh sinners do.","The man in the gospel made the desperate condition of his child an argument with Christ to haste his cure: 'Sire, come down,' saith he, 'ere my child die' (John 4:49), and Christ regarded his haste, saying, 'Go thy way; thy son liveth' (verse 50).",Haste requires haste.,David was for speed; 'Deliver me speedily'; 'Hear me speedily'; 'Answer me speedily' (Psa 31:2; 69:17; 102:2).,But why speedily?,I am in 'the net'; 'I am in trouble'; 'My days are consumed like smoke' (Psa 31:4; 69:17; 102:3).,"Deep calleth unto deep, necessity calls for help; great necessity for present help.","Wherefore, I say, be ruled by me in this matter; feign not thyself another man, if thou hast been a filthy sinner, but go in thy colours to Jesus Christ, and put thyself among the most vile, and let him alone to 'put thee among the children' (Jer 3:19).","Confess all that thou knowest of thyself; I know thou wilt find it hard work to do thus: especially if thy mind be legal; but do it, lest thou stay and be deferred with the little sinners, until the great ones have had their alms.","What do you think David intended when he said, his wounds stunk and were corrupted, but to hasten God to have mercy upon him, and not to defer his cure?","'Lord,' says he, 'I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.'",'I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart' (Psa 38:3-8).,"David knew what he did by all this; he knew that his making the worst of his case, was the way to speedy help, and that a feigning and dissembling the matter with God, was the next way to a demur as to his forgiveness.","I have one thing more to offer for thy encouragement, who deemest thyself one of the biggest sinners; and that is, thou art as it were called by thy name, in the first place, to come in for mercy.","Thou man of Jerusalem, hearken to thy call; men do so in courts of judicature, and presently cry out, 'Here, Sire'; and then they shoulder and crowd, and say, 'Pray give way, I am called into the court.'","Why, this is thy case, thou great, thou Jerusalem sinner; be of good cheer, he calleth thee (Mark 10:46-49).",Why sittest thou still?,arise: why standest thou still?,"come, man, thy call should give thee authority to come.","'Begin at Jerusalem,' is thy call and authority to come; wherefore up and shoulder it, man; say, 'Stand away, devil, Christ calls me; stand away unbelief, Christ calls me; stand away, all ye my discouraging apprehensions, for my Saviour calls me to him to receive of his mercy.'","Men will do thus, as I said, in courts below; and why shouldst not thou approach thus to the court above?","The Jerusalem sinner is first in thought, first in commission, first in the record of names; and therefore should give attendance, with the expectation that he is first to receive mercy of God.",Is not this an encouragement to the biggest sinners to make their application to Christ for mercy?,"'Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,' doth also confirm this thing; that is, that the biggest sinner, and he that has the biggest burden, is he who is first invited.","Christ pointeth over the heads of thousands, as he sits on the throne of grace, directly to such a man; and says, 'Bring in hither the maimed, the halt, and the blind; let the Jerusalem sinner that stands there behind come to me.'","Wherefore, since Christ says, 'Come,' to thee, let the angels make a lane, and let all men give place, that the Jerusalem sinner may come to Jesus Christ for mercy.","Fourth, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners?","Then come, thou profane wretch, and let me a little enter into an argument with thee.","Why wilt thou not come to Jesus Christ, since thou art a Jerusalem sinner?","How canst thou find in thy heart to set thyself against grace, against such grace as offereth mercy to thee?","What spirit possesseth thee, and holds thee back from a sincere closure with thy Saviour?","Behold, God groaningly complains of thee, saying, 'But Israel would none of me.'","'When I called, none did answer' (Psa 81:11;

yet, to them that shall perish from under this word, even this text will be to such one of the hottest coals in hell.","This text, therefore, will save thee or sink thee: there is no shifting of it; if it saves thee, it will set thee high; if it sinks thee, it will set thee low.","But, I say, why so unconcerned?",Hast no soul?,"or dost think thou mayest lose thy soul, and save thyself?","Is it not pity, had it otherwise been the will of God, that ever thou wast made a man, for that thou settest so little by thy soul?","Sinner, take the invitation;

for those that presume, I shall say something to them afterward.",I now speak to them that despair.,There are four sorts of despair.,"There is the despair of devils; there is the despair of souls in hell; there is the despair that is grounded upon men's deficiency; and there is the despair that they are perplexed with that are willing to be saved, but are too strongly borne down with the burden of their sins.","The despair of devils, the damned's despair, and that despair that a man has of attaining of life because of his own deficiency, are all reasonable.",Why should not devils and damned souls despair?,"yea, why should not man despair of getting to heaven by his own abilities?","I, therefore, am concerned only with the fourth sort of despair, to wit, with the despair of those that would be saved, but are too strongly borne down with the burden of their sins.","I say, therefore, to thee that art thus, And why despair?","Thy despair, if it was reasonable, should flow from thee, because found in the land that is beyond the grave; or because thou certainly knowest that Christ will not, or cannot save thee.","But, for the first, thou art yet in the land of the living; and, for the second, thou hast ground to believe the quite contrary; Christ is able to save to the uttermost them that come to God by him; and if he were not willing, he would not have commanded that mercy, in the first place, should be offered to the biggest sinners.","Besides, he hath said, 'And let him that is athirst come.","And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely'; that is, with all my heart.",What ground now is here for despair?,"If thou sayest, The number and burden of my sins; I answer, Nay; that is rather a ground for faith; because such an one, above all others, is invited by Christ to come unto him, yea, promised rest and forgiveness if they come (Matt 11:28).",What ground then to despair?,"Verily, none at all.","Thy despair, then, is a thing unreasonable, and without footing in the Word.","But I have no experience of God's love; God hath given me no comfort, or ground of hope, though I have waited upon him for it many a day.","Thou hast e xperience of God's love, for that he has opened thine eyes to see thy sins: and for that he has given thee desires to be saved by Jesus Christ.","For by thy sense of sin thou art made to see thy poverty of spirit, and that has laid under thee a sure ground to hope that heaven shall be thine hereafter.","Also thy desires to be saved by Christ, has put thee under another promise, so there is two to hold thee up in hope, though thy present burden be never so heavy (Matt 5:3,6).","As for what thou sayest as to God's silence to thee, perhaps he has spoken to thee once or twice already, but thou hast not perceived it (Job 33:14,15).","However, thou hast Christ crucified set forth before thine eyes in the Bible, and an invitation to come unto him, though thou be a Jerusalem sinner, though thou be a biggest sinner; and so no ground to despair.","What if God will be silent to thee, is that ground of despair?","Not at all, so long as there is a promise in the Bible, that God will in no wise cast away the coming sinner, and so long as he invites the Jerusalem sinner to come unto him (John 6:37).","Build not, therefore, despair upon these things; they are no sufficient foundation for it, such plenty of promises being in the Bible, and such a discovery of his mercy to great sinners of old; especially since we have withal a clause in the commission given to ministers to preach, that they should begin with the Jerusalem sinners in their offering of mercy to the world.","Besides, God says, 'They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles'; but, perhaps, it may be long first.","I waited long, saith David, and did seek the Lord; and, at length, his cry was heard: wherefore he bids his soul wait on God, and says, For it is good so to do before thy saints (Psa 40:1; 62:5; 52:9).",And what if thou waitest upon God all thy days?,Is it below thee?,"And what if God will cross his book, and blot out the handwriting that is against thee, and not let thee know it as yet?","Is it fit to say unto God, Thou art hard-hearted?","Despair not;

this is not the time to despair in; as long as mine eyes can find a promise in the Bible, as long as there is the least mention of grace, as long as there is a moment left me of breath or life in this world, so long will I wait or look for mercy, so long will I fight against unbelief and despair.'",This is the way to honour God and Christ; this is the way to set the crown on the promise; this is the way to welcome the invitation and inviter; and this is the way to thrust thyself under the shelter and protection of the word of grace.,"Never despair so long as our text is alive, for that doth sound it out--that mercy by Christ is offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinner.",Despair is an unprofitable thing; it will make a man weary of waiting upon God (2 Kings 6:33).,"It will make a man forsake God, and seek his heaven in the good things of this world (Gen 4:13-18).","It will make a man his own tormentor, and flounce and fling like 'a wild bull in a net' (Isa 51:20).",Despair!,"it drives a man to the study of his own ruin, and brings him at last to be his own executioner (2 Sam 17:23; Matt 27:3-5).","Besides, I am persuaded also, that despair is the cause that there are so many that would fain be Atheists in the world.","For, because, they have entertained a conceit that God will never be merciful to them, therefore they labour to persuade themselves that there is no God at all, as if their misbelief would kill God, or cause him to cease to be.","A poor shift for an immortal soul, for a soul who liketh not to retain God in its knowledge!","If this be the best that despair can do, let it go, man, and betake thyself to faith, to prayer, to wait for God, and to hope, in despite of ten thousand doubts.","And for thy encouragement, take yet, as an addition to what has already been said, the following Scripture: 'The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy' (Psa 147:11).","Whence note, They fear not God, that hope not in his mercy; also, God is angry with them that hope not in his mercy; for he only taketh pleasure in them that hope.","'He that believeth,' or 'hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true' (John 3:33).","But he that receiveth it not, 'hath made him a liar,' and that is a very unworthy thing (1 John 5:10,11).","'Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly' multiply 'pardon' (Isa 55:7).","Perhaps thou art weary of thy ways, but art not weary of thy thoughts; of thy unbelieving and despairing thoughts; now, God also would have thee cast away these thoughts, as such which he deserveth not at thy hands; for 'he will have mercy upon thee, and he will abundantly pardon.'","'O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!'",(Luke 24:25).,"Mark you, here, slowness to believe is a piece of folly.",Ay!,"but sayest thou, I do believe some, and I believe what can make against me.","Ay, but sinner, Christ Jesus here calls thee fool for not believing all.","Believe all, and despair if thou canst!","He that believes all, believes that text that saith, Christ would have mercy preached first to the Jerusalem sinners.","He that believeth all, believeth all the promises and consolations of the Word; and the promises and consolations of the Word weigh heavier than do all the curses and threatenings of the law; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.","Wherefore believe all, and mercy will, to thy conscience, weigh judgment down, and so minister comfort to thy soul.","The Lord take the yoke from off thy jaws, since he has set meat before thee (Hosea 11:4).","And help thee to remember that he is pleased, in the first place, to offer mercy to the biggest sinners.","Sixth, Since Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, let souls see that they lay right hold thereof, lest they, notwithstanding, indeed, come short thereof.","Faith only knows how to deal with mercy; wherefore, put not in the place thereof presumption.","I have observed, that, as there are herbs and flowers in our gardens, so there are their counterfeits in the field; only they are distinguished from the other by the name of wild ones.","Why, there is faith, and wild faith; and wild faith is this presumption.","I call it wild faith, because God never placed it in his garden--his church; 'tis only to be found in the field--the world.","I also call it wild faith, because it only grows up and is nourished where other wild notions abound.","Wherefore, take heed of this, and all may be well; for this presumptuousness is a very heinous thing in the eyes of God.","'The soul,' saith he, 'that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people' (Num 15:30).","The thoughts of this made David tremble, and pray that God would hold him back from presumptuous sins, and not suffer them to have dominion over him (Psa 19:13).","Now, this presumption, then, puts itself in the place of faith, when it tampereth with the promise for life, while the soul is a stranger to repentance.","Wherefore, you have in the text, to prevent doing thus, both repentance and remission of sins to be offered to Jerusalem; not remission without repentance, for all that repent not shall perish, let them presume on grace and the promise while they will (Luke 13:1-3).","Presumption, then, is that which severeth faith and repentance; concluding that the soul shall be saved by grace, though the man was never made sorry for his sins, nor the love of the heart turned therefrom.","This is to be self-willed, as Peter has it; and this is a despising the Word of the Lord, for that has put repentance and faith together (Mark 1:15).","And 'because he hath despised the Word of the Lord, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off: his iniquity shall be upon him' (Num 15:31).","Let such, therefore, look to it who yet are, and abide, in their sins; for such, if they hope, as they are, to be saved, presume upon the grace of God.27 Wherefore, presumption and not hearkening to God's Word are put together (Deu 17:12).","Again, THEN men presume, when they are resolved to abide in their sins, and yet expect to be saved by God's grace through Christ.","This is as much as to say, God liketh of sin as well as I do, and careth not how men live, if so be they lean upon his Son.","Of this sort are they 'that build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity'; that 'judge for reward, and--teach for hire, and--divine for money, and lean upon the Lord' (Micah 3:10,11).","This is doing things, with an high hand, against the Lord our God, and a taking him, as it were, at the catch.28 This is, as we say among men, to seek to put a trick upon God; as if he had not sufficiently fortified his proposals of grace, by his holy Word, against all such kind of fools as these.",But look to it!,"Such will be found at the day of God, not among that great company of Jerusalem sinners that shall be saved by grace, but among those that have been the great abusers of the grace of God in the world.","Those that say, Let us sin that grace may abound, and let us do evil that good may come, their damnation is just.","And if so, they are a great way off of that salvation that is, by Jesus Christ, presented to the Jerusalem sinners.","I have, therefore, these things to propound to that Jerusalem sinner that would know, if he may be so bold [as] to venture himself upon this grace.",1.,Dost thou see thy sins?,2.,Art thou weary of them?,3.,"Wouldst thou, with all thy heart, be saved by Jesus Christ?",I dare say no less; I dare say no more.,"But if it be truly thus with thee, how great soever thy sins have been, how bad soever thou feelest thy heart, how far soever thou art from thinking that God has mercy for thee, thou art the man, the Jerusalem sinner, that the Word of God has conquered, and to whom it offereth free remission of sins, by the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.","When the jailor cried out, 'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?'","the answer was, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.'","He that sees his sins aright, is brought to his wit's end by them; and he that is so, is willing to part from them, and to be saved by the grace of God.","If this be thy case, fear not, give no way to despair; thou presumest not, if thou believest to life everlasting in Jesus Christ; yea, Christ is prepared for such as thou art.","Therefore, take good courage, and believe.","The design of Satan is, to tell the presumptuous that their presuming on mercy is good; but to persuade the believer, that his believing is impudent, bold dealing with God.","I never heard a presumptuous man, in my life, say that he was afraid that he presumed; but I have heard many an honest humble soul say, that they have been afraid that their faith has been presumption.",Why should Satan molest those whose ways he knows will bring them to him?,"And who can think that he should be quiet, when men take the right course to escape his hellish snares?","This, therefore, is the reason why the truly humbled is opposed, while the presumptuous goes on by wind and tide.","The truly humble, Satan hates; but he laughs to see the foolery of the other.",Does thy hand and heart tremble?,Upon thee the promise smiles.,"'To this man will I look,' says God, 'even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word' (Isa 66:2).","What, therefore, I have said of presumption, concerns not the humble in spirit at all.","I therefore am for gathering up the stones, and for taking the stumbling-blocks out of the way of God's people; and forewarning of them, that they lay the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their faces; and [of those] that are for presuming upon God's mercy; and let them look to themselves (Eze 14:6-8).","Also, our text stands firm as ever it did, and our observation is still of force, that Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners.","So them, let none despair, let none presume; let none despair that are sorry for their sins, and would be saved by Jesus Christ; let none presume that abide in the liking of their sins, though they seem to know the exceeding grace of Christ; for though the door stands wide open for the reception of the penitent, yet it is fast29 enough barred and bolted against the presumptuous sinner.","Be not deceived, God is not mocked; whatsoever a man sows, that he shall reap.","It cannot be that God should be wheedled out of his mercy, or prevailed upon by lips of dissimulation; he knows them that trust on him, and that sincerely come to him, by Christ, for mercy (Nahum 1:7).","It is, then, not the abundance of sins committed, but the not coming heartily to God, by Christ, for mercy, that shuts men out of doors.","And though their not coming heartily may be said to be but a sin, yet it is such a sin as causeth that all thy other sins abide upon thee unforgiven.",God complains of this.,"'They have not cried unto me with their heart--they return, but not to the most High.'","They turned 'feignedly' (Jer 3:10; Hosea 7:14,16).","Thus doing, his soul hates [them]; but the penitent, humble, broken-hearted sinner, be his transgressions red as scarlet, red like crimson, in number as the sand; though his transgressions cry to heaven against him for vengeance, and seem there to cry louder than do his prayers, or tears, or groans for mercy; yet he is safe.",To this man God will look (Isa 1:18; 66:2).,"Seventh, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners?","Then here is ground for those that, as to practice, have not been such, to come to him for mercy.","Although there is no sin little of itself, because it is a contradiction of the nature and majesty of God, yet we must admit of divers numbers, and, also, of aggravations.","Two sins are not so many as three; nor are three that are done in ignorance so big as one that is done against light, against knowledge and conscience.","Also, there is the child in sin, and a man in sin that has his hairs gray and his skin wrinkled for very age.","And we must put a difference betwixt these sinners also; for can it be that a child of seven, or ten, or sixteen years old, should be such a sinner--a sinner so vile in the eyes of the law as he is who has walked according to the course of this world, forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy years?","Now, the youth, this stripling, though he is a sinner, is but a little sinner, when compared with such.","Now, I say, if there be room for the first sort, for those of the biggest size, certainly there is room for the lesser size.","If there be a door wide enough for a giant to go in at, there is certainly room for a dwarf.","If Christ Jesus has grace enough to save great sinners, he has surely grace enough to save little ones.","If he can forgive five hundred pence, for certain he can forgive fifty (Luke 7:41,42).","But you said before, that the little sinners must stand by until the great ones have received their grace, and that is discouraging!","I answer, there are two sorts of little sinners--such as are so, and such as feign themselves so.","There are those that feign themselves so, that I intended there, and not those that are, indeed, comparatively so.","Such as feign themselves so, may wait long enough before they obtain forgiveness.","But again, a sinner may be comparatively a little sinner, and sensibly a great one.","There are, then, two sorts of greatness in sin--greatness by reason of number; greatness by reason of thoroughness of conviction of the horrible nature of sin.","In this last sense, he that has but one sin, if such an one could be found, may, in his own eyes, find himself the biggest sinner in the world.","Let this man or this child, therefore, put himself among the great sinners, and plead with God as great sinners do, and expect to be saved with the great sinners, and as soon and as heartily as they.","Yea, a little sinner, that, comparatively, is truly so, if he shall graciously give way to conviction, and shall, in God's light, diligently weigh the horrible nature of his own sin, may yet sooner obtain forgiveness for them at the hands of the heavenly Father, than he that has ten times his sins, and so cause to cry ten times harder to God for mercy.","For the grievousness of the cry is a great thing with God; for if he will hear the widow, if she cries at all, how much more if she cries most grievously?","(Exo 22:22,23).","It is not the number, but the true sense of the abominable nature of sin, that makes the cry for pardon lamentable.","30 He, as I said, that has many sins, may not cry so loud in the ears of God as he that has far fewer; he, in our present sense, that is in his own eyes the biggest sinner, is he that soonest findeth mercy.","The offer, then, is to the biggest sinner; to the biggest sinner first, and the mercy is first obtained by him that first confesseth himself to be such an one.","There are men that strive at the throne of grace for mercy, by pleading the greatness of their necessity.","Now their plea, as to the prevalency of it, lieth not in their counting up of the number, but in the sense of the greatness of their sins, and in the vehemency of their cry for pardon.","And it is observable, that though the birthright was Reuben's, and, for his foolishness, given to the sons of Joseph, yet Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the Messiah (1 Chron 5:1,2).",There is a heavenly subtilty to be managed in this matter.,"'Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.'","The blessing belonged to Esau, but Jacob by his diligence made it his own (Gen 27:35).","The offer is to the biggest sinner, to the biggest sinner first; but if he forbear to cry, the sinner that is a sinner less by far than he, both as to number and the nature of transgression, may get the blessing first, if he shall have grace to bestir himself well; for the loudest cry is heard furthest, and the most lamentable pierces soonest.","I therefore urge this head, not because I would have little sinners go and tell God that they are little sinners, thereby to think to obtain his mercy; for, verily, so they are never like to have it; for such words declare, that such an one hath no true sense at all of the nature of his sins.","Sin, as I said, in the nature of it, is horrible, though it be but one single sin as to act; yea, though it be but a sinful thought; and so worthily calls for the damnation of the soul.","The comparison, then, of little and great sinners, is to go for good sense among men.","But to plead the fewness of thy sins, or the comparative harmlessness of their quantity before God, argueth no sound knowledge of the nature of thy sin, and so no true sense of the nature or need of mercy.",Little sinner!,"when therefore thou goest to God, though thou knowest in thy conscience that thou, as to acts, art no thief, no murderer, no whore, no liar, no false swearer, or the like, and in reason must needs understand that thus thou art not so profanely vile as others; yet when thou goest to God for mercy, know no man's sins but thine own, make mention of no man's sins but thine own.","Also labour not to lessen thy own, but magnify and greaten them by all just circumstances, and be as if there was never a sinner in the world but thyself.","Also cry out, as if thou wast but the only undone man; and that is the way to obtain God's mercy.","It is one of the comeliest sights in the world to see a little sinner commenting upon the greatness of his sins, multiplying and multiplying them to himself, till he makes them in his own eyes bigger and higher than he seeth any other man's sins to be in the world; and as base a thing it is to see a man do otherwise, and as basely will come on it (Luke 18:10-14).","As, therefore, I said to the great sinner before, let him take heed lest he presume; I say now to the little sinner, let him take heed that he do not dissemble; for there is as great an aptness in the little sinner to dissemble, as there is in the great one.","'He that hideth his sins shall not prosper,'31 be he a sinner little or great (Prov 28:13).","Eighth, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners?",Then this shows the true cause why Satan makes such head as he doth against him.,The Father and the Holy Spirit are well spoken of by all deluders and deceived persons; Christ only is the rock of offence.,"'Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling-stone and rock of offence' (Rom 9:33).","Not that Satan careth for the Father or the Spirit more than he careth for the Son; but he can let men alone with their notions of the Father and the Spirit, for he knows they shall never enjoy the Father or the Spirit, if indeed they receive not the merits of the Son.","'He that hath the Son, hath life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not life,' however they may boast themselves of the Father and the Spirit (1 John 5:12).","Again, 'Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.","He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son' (2 John 9).","Christ, and Christ only, is he that can make us capable to enjoy God with life and joy to all eternity.","Hence he calls himself the way to the Father, the true and living way (John 14:6).","For we cannot come to the Father but by him (Heb 10:19,20).","Satan knows this, therefore he hates him.","Deluded persons are ignorant of this, and therefore, they are so led up and down by Satan by the nose as they are.",There are many things by which Satan has taken occasion to greaten his rage against Jesus Christ.,"As, first, His love to man, and then, the many expressions of that love.","He hath taken man's nature upon him; he hath in that nature fulfilled the law to bring in righteousness for man; and hath spilt his blood for the reconciling of man to God; he hath broke the neck of death, put away sin, destroyed the works of the devil, and got into his own hands the keys of death; and all these are heinous things to Satan.",He cannot abide Christ for this.,"Besides, He hath eternal life in himself, and that to bestow upon us; and we in all likelihood are to possess the very places from which the Satans by transgression fell, if not places more glorious.",Wherefore he must needs be angry.,"And is it not a vexatious thing to him, that we should be admitted to the throne of grace by Christ, while he stands bound over in chains of darkness, to answer for his rebellions against God and his Son, at the terrible day of judgment.","Yea, we poor dust and ashes must become his judges, and triumph over him for ever: and all this long32 of Jesus Christ; for he is the meritorious cause of all this.","Now though Satan seeks to be revenged for this, yet he knows it is in vain to attack the person of Christ; He [Christ] has overcome him; therefore he [Satan] tampers with a company of silly men; that he may vilify him by them.","And they, bold fools as they are, will not spare to spit in his face.","They will rail at his person, and deny the very being of it; they will rail at his blood, and deny the merit and worth of it.","They will deny the very end why he accomplished the law, and by jiggs, and tricks, and quirks, which he helpeth them to, they set up fond names and images in his place, and give the glory of a Saviour to them.",Thus Satan worketh under the name of Christ; and his ministers under the name of the ministers of righteousness.,"And by his wiles and stratagems he undoes a world of men; but there is a seed, and they shall serve him, and it shall be counted to the Lord for a generation.","These shall see their sins, and that Christ is the way to happiness.","These shall venture themselves, both body and soul, upon his worthiness.","All this Satan knows, and therefore his rage is kindled the more.","Wherefore, according to his ability and allowance, he assaulteth, tempteth, abuseth, and stirs up what he can to be hurtful to these poor people, that he may, while his time shall last, make it as hard and difficult for them to go to eternal glory as he can.","Ofttimes he abuses them with wrong apprehensions of God, and with wrong apprehensions of Christ.","He also casts them into the mire, to the reproach of religion, the shame of their brethren, the derision of the world, and dishonour of God.","He holds our hands while the world buffets us; he puts bear-skins upon us, and then sets the dogs at us.","He bedaubeth us with his own foam, and then tempts us to believe that that bedaubing comes from ourselves.33 Oh!","the rage and the roaring of this lion, and the hatred that he manifests against the Lord Jesus, and against them that are purchased with his blood!","But yet, in the midst of all this, the Lord Jesus sends forth his herald to proclaim in the nations his love to the world, and to invite them to come in to him for life.","Yea, his invitation is so large, that it offereth his mercy in the first place to the biggest sinners of every age, which augments the devil's rage the more.","Wherefore, as I said before, fret he, fume he, the Lord Jesus will 'divide the spoil' with this great one; yea, he shall divide the spoil with the strong, 'because he hath poured out his soul unto death, and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors' (Isa 53:12).","Ninth, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners?",Let the tempted harp upon this string for their help and consolation.,"The tempted, wherever he dwells, always thinks himself the biggest sinner, one most unworthy of eternal life.","This is Satan's master argument; thou art a horrible sinner, a hypocrite, one that has a profane heart, and one that is an utter stranger to a work of grace.","I say this is his maul, his club, 34 his masterpiece; he doth with this as some do with their most enchanting songs, sings them everywhere.",I believe there are but few saints in the world that have not had this temptation sounding in their ears.,"But were they but aware, Satan by all this does but drive them to the gap out at which they should go, and so escape his roaring.","Saith he, thou art a great sinner, a horrible sinner, a profane-hearted wretch, one that cannot be matched for a vile one in the country.","And all this while Christ says to his ministers, offer mercy, in the first place, to the biggest sinners.",So that this temptation drives thee directly into the arms of Jesus Christ.,"Were therefore the tempted but aware, he might say, 'Ay, Satan, so I am, I am a sinner of the biggest size, and therefore have most need of Jesus Christ; yea, because I am such a wretch, therefore Jesus Christ calls me; yea, he calls me first; the first proffer of the gospel is to be made to the Jerusalem sinner; I am he, wherefore stand back, Satan; make a lane, my right is first to come to Jesus Christ.'",This now would be like for like.,"This would foil the devil; this would make him say, I must not deal with this man thus; for then I put a sword into his hand to cut off my head.","And this is the meaning of Peter, when he saith, 'Resist him steadfast in the faith' (1 Peter 5:9).","And of Paul, when he saith, 'Take the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked' (Eph 6:16).","Wherefore is it said, Begin at Jerusalem, if the Jerusalem sinner is not to have the benefit of it?","And if I am to have the benefit of it, let me call it to mind when Satan haunts me with continual remembrance of my sins, of my Jerusalem sins.","Satan and my conscience say I am the biggest sinner:--Christ offereth mercy, in the first place, to the biggest sinners!",Nor is the manner of the offer other but such as suiteth with my mind.,"I am sorry for my sin; yea, sorry at my heart that ever sinful thought did enter, or find the least entertainment in my wicked mind: and might I obtain my wish, I would never more that my heart should be a place for ought but the grace, and spirit, and faith of the Lord Jesus.","I speak not this to lessen my wickedness; I would not for all the world but be placed by mine own conscience in the very front of the biggest sinners, that I might be one of the first that are beckoned, by the gracious hand of Jesus the Saviour, to come to him for mercy.","Well, sinner, thou now speakest like a Christian; but say thus, in a strong spirit, in the hour of temptation, and then thou wilt, to thy commendation and comfort, quit thyself well.","This improving of Christ, in dark hours, is the life, though the hardest part of our Christianity.","We should neither stop at darkness nor at the raging of our lusts, but go on in a way of venturing, and casting the whole of our affairs for the next world at the foot of Jesus Christ.","This is the way to make the darkness light, and also to allay the raging of corruption.","The first time the Passover was eaten was in the night; and when Israel took courage to go forward, though the sea stood in their way like a devouring gulf, and the host of the Egyptians follow them at the heels; yet the sea gives place, and their enemies were as still as a stone till they were gone over (Exo 12:8; 14:13,14,21,22; 15:16).",There is nothing like faith to help at a pinch; faith dissolves doubts as the sun drives away the mists.,"And that you may not be put out, know your time, as I said, of believing is always.","There are times when some graces may be out of use, but there is no time wherein faith can be said to be so.","Wherefore, faith must be always in exercise.","Faith is the eye, is the mouth, is the hand, and one of these is of use all day long.","Faith is to see, to receive, to work, or to eat; and a Christian should be seeing, or receiving, or working, or feeding all day long.","Let it rain, let it blow, let it thunder, let it lighten, a Christian must still believe.","At 'what time,' said the good man, 'I am afraid, I will trust in thee' (Psa 56:2,3).","Nor can we have a better encouragement to do this than is, by the text, set before us; even an open heart for a Jerusalem sinner.","And if for a Jerusalem sinner to come, then for such an one when come.","If for such an one to be saved, then for such an one that is saved.","If for such an one to be pardoned his great transgressions, then for such an one who is pardoned these to come daily to Jesus Christ too, to be cleansed and set free from his common infirmities, and from the iniquities of his holy things.","Therefore, let the poor sinner that would be saved labour for skill to make the best improvement of the grace of Christ to help him against the temptations of the devil and his sins.","Tenth, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners?","Let those men consider this that have, or may, in a day of trial, spoken or done what their profession or conscience told them they should not, and that have the guilt and burden thereof upon their consciences.","Whether a thing be wrong or right, guilt may pursue him that doth contrary to his conscience.","But suppose a man should deny his God, or his Christ, or relinquish a good profession, and be under the real guilt thereof, shall he, therefore, conclude he is gone for ever?","Let him come again with Peter's tears, and no doubt but he shall obtain Peter's forgiveness; for the text includes the biggest sinners.","And it is observable, that before this clause was put into this commission, Peter was pardoned his horrible revolt from his Master.","He that revolteth in the day of trial, if he is not shot quite dead upon the place, but is sensible of his wound, and calls out for a chirurgeon, shall find his Lord at hand to pour wine and oil into his wounds, that he may again be healed, and to encourage him to think that there may be mercy for him; besides what we find recorded of Peter, you read in the Acts, some were, through the violence of their trials, compelled to blaspheme, and yet are called saints (Acts 26:9-11).","Hence you have a promise or two that speak concerning such kind of men, to encourage us to think that, at least, some of them shall come back to the Lord their God.","'Shall they fall,' saith he, 'and not arise?","Shall he turn away, and not return?'",(Jer 8:4).,"'and in that day will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted.","And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation; and the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion--for ever.'","What we are to understand by her that halteth, is best expressed by the prophet Elijah (Micah 4:6,7; Zeph 3:19; 1 Kings 18:21).","I will conclude, then, that for them that have halted, or may halt, the Lord has mercy in the bank,35 and is willing to accept them if they return to him again.","Perhaps they may never be after that of any great esteem in the house of God, but if the Lord will admit them to favour and forgiveness--O exceeding and undeserved mercy!",(See Ezekiel 44:10-14).,"Thou, then, that mayest be the man, remember this, that there is mercy also for thee.","Return, therefore, to God, and to his Son, who hath yet in store for thee, and who will do thee good.","But, perhaps, thou wilt say, He doth not save all revolters, and, therefore, perhaps not me.",Answer.,Art thou returning to God?,"If thou art returning, thou art the man; 'Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings' (Jer 3:22).","Some, as I said, that revolt, are shot dead upon the place; and for them, who can help them?","But for them that cry out of their wounds it is a sign that they are yet alive, and, if they use the means in time, doubtless they may be healed.",Christ Jesus has bags of mercy that were never yet broken up or unsealed.,"Hence it is said, he has goodness laid up; things reserved in heaven for his.","And if he breaks up one of these bags, who can tell what he can do?","Hence his love is said to be such as passeth knowledge, and that his riches are unsearchable.","He has, nobody knows what; for nobody knows who!","He has by him, in store, for such as seem, in the view of all men, to be gone beyond recovery.","For this, the text is plain.",What man or angel could have thought that the Jerusalem sinners had been yet on this side of an impossibility of enjoying life and mercy?,"Hadst thou seen their actions, and what horrible things they did to the Son of God; yea, how stoutly they backed what they did with resolves and endeavours to persevere, when they had killed his person, against his name and doctrine; and that there was not found among them all that while, as we read of, the least remorse or regret for these their doings; couldest though have imagined that mercy would ever have took hold of them, at least so soon!","Nay, that they should, of all the world, be counted those only meet to have it offered to them in the very first place!","For so my text commands, saying, Preach repentance and remission of sins among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.","I tell you the thing is a wonder, and must for ever stand for a wonder among the sons of men.","It stands, also, for an everlasting invitation and allurement to the biggest sinners to come to Christ for mercy.","Now since, in the opinion of all men, the revolter is such an one; if he has, as I said before, any life in him, let him take encouragement to come again, that he may live by Christ.","Eleventh, Would Jesus Christ have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners?",Then let God's ministers tell them so.,"There is an incidence36 in us, I know not how it doth come about, when we are converted, to contemn them that are left behind.","Poor fools as we are, we forget that we ourselves were so (Titus 3:2,3).","But would it not become us better, since we have tasted that the Lord is gracious, to carry it towards them so, that we may give them convincing ground to believe that we have found that mercy which also sets open the door for them to come and partake with us.","Ministers, I say, should do thus, both by their doctrine, and in all other respects.","Austerity doth not become us, neither in doctrine nor in conversation.37 We ourselves live by grace; let us give as we receive, and labour to persuade our fellow-sinners, which God has left behind us, to follow after, that they may partake with us of grace.",We are saved by grace; let us live like them that are gracious.,"Let all our things, to the world, be done in charity towards them; pity them, pray for them, be familiar with them, for their good.","Let us lay aside our foolish, worldly, carnal grandeur; let us not walk the streets, and have such behaviours as signify we are scarce for touching of the poor ones that are left behind; no, not with a pair of tongs.",It becomes not ministers thus to do.,[A gentle reproof.],"Remember your Lord, he was familiar with publicans and sinners to a proverb: 'Behold a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners' (Matt 11:19).","The first part, concerning his gluttonous eating and drinking, to be sure, was an horrible slander; but for the other, nothing was ever spoke truer of him by the world.","Now, why should we lay hands cross on this text; that is, choose good victuals, and love the sweet wine better than the salvation of the poor publican?","Why not familiar with sinners, provided we hate their spots and blemishes, and seek that they may be healed of them?",Why not fellowly with our carnal neighbours?,"If we do take occasion to do so, that we may drop, and be yet distilling some good doctrine upon their souls?","Why not go to the poor man's house, and give him a penny, and a Scripture to think upon?","Why not send for the poor to fetch away, at least, the fragments of thy table, that the bowels of thy fellow-sinner may be refreshed as well as thine?","Ministers should be exemplary; but I am an inferior man, and must take heed of too much meddling.","But might I, I would meddle with them, with their wives, and with their children too.","I mean not this of all, but of them that deserve it, though I may not name them.","But, I say, let ministers follow the steps of their blessed Lord, who, by word and deed, showed his love to the salvation of the world, in such a carriage as declared him to prefer their salvation before his own private concern.","For we are commanded to follow his steps, 'who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.'","And as I have said concerning ministers, so I say to all the brethren, Carry it so, that all the world may see, that indeed you are the sons of love.","Love your Saviour; yea, show one to another that you love him, not only by a seeming love of affection, but with the love of duty.",Practical love is best.38 Many love Christ with nothing but the lick of the tongue.,Alas!,"Christ Jesus the Lord must not be put off thus; 'He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them,' saith he, 'he it is that loveth me' (John 14:21).","Practical love, which stands in self-denial, in charity to my neighbour, and a patient enduring of affliction for his name; this is counted love.",Right love to Christ is that which carries in it a provoking argument to others of the brethren (Heb 10:24).,Should a man ask me how he should know that he loveth the children of God?,"the best answer I could give him, would be in the words of the apostle John; 'By this,' saith he, 'we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments' (1 John 5:2).","Love to God and Christ is then shown, when we are tender of his name; and then we show ourselves tender of his name, when we are afraid to break any, the least of his commandments.","And when we are here, then do we show our love to our brother also.",[The Conclusion.],"Now, we have obligation sufficient thus to do, for that our Lord loved us, and gave himself for us, to deliver us from death, that we might live through him.","The world, when they hear the doctrine that I have asserted and handled in this little book; to wit, that Jesus Christ would have mercy offered, in the first place, to the biggest sinners, will be apt, because themselves are unbelievers, to think that this is a doctrine that leads to looseness, and that gives liberty to the flesh; but if you that believe love your brethren and your neighbours truly, and as you should, you will put to silence the ignorance of such foolish men, and stop their mouths from speaking evil of you.","And, I say, let the love of Christ constrain us to this.","Who deserveth our heart, our mouth, our life, our goods, so much as Jesus Christ, who has bought us to himself by his blood, to this very end, that we should be a peculiar people, zealous of good works?","There is nothing more seemly in the world than to see a Christian walk as becomes the gospel; nor anything more unbecoming a reasonable creature, than to hear a man say, 'I believe in Christ,' and yet see in his life debauchery and profaneness.","Might I, such men should be counted the basest of men; such men should be counted by all unworthy of the name of a Christian, and should be shunned by every good man, as such who are the very plague of profession.","For so it is written, we should carry it towards them.","Whoso have a form of godliness, and deny the power thereof, from such we must turn away.","It has ofttimes come into my mind to ask, By what means it is that the gospel profession should be so tainted39 with loose and carnal gospellers?","and I could never arrive to better satisfaction in the matter than this--such men are made professors by the devil, and so by him put among the rest of the godly.",A certain man had a fruitless fig tree planted in his vineyard; but by whom was it planted there?,"even by him that sowed the tares, his own children, among the wheat (Luke 13:6; Matt 13:37-40).",And that was the devil.,But why doth the devil do thus?,"Not of love to them, but to make of them offences and stumbling-blocks to others.",For he knows that a loose professor in the church does more mischief to religion than ten can do to it that are in the world.,"Was it not, think you, the devil that stirred up the damsel that you read of in Acts 16 to cry out, 'These men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation?'","Yes it was, as is evident, for Paul was grieved to hear it.","But why did the devil stir up her to cry so, but because that was the way to blemish the gospel, and to make the world think that it came from the same hand as did her soothsaying and witchery?",(verse 16-18).,"'Holiness, O Lord, becomes thy house for ever.'","Let, therefore, whoever they be that profess the name of Christ, take heed that they scandal not that profession which they make of him, since he has so graciously offered us, as we are sinners of the biggest size, in the first place, his grace to save us.",[Answers to Objections.],"Having thus far spoken of the riches of the grace of Christ, and of the freeness of his heart to embrace the Jerusalem sinners, it may not be amiss to give you yet, as a caution, an intimation of one thing, namely, that this grace and freeness of his heart, is limited to time and day; the which, whoso overstandeth, shall perish notwithstanding.","For, as a king, who, of grace, sendeth out to his rebellious people an offer of pardon, if they accept thereof by such a day, yet beheadeth or hangeth those that come not in for mercy until the day or time be past; so Christ Jesus has set the sinner a day, a day of salvation, an acceptable time; but he who standeth out, or goeth on in rebellion beyond that time, is like to come off with the loss of his soul (2 Cor 6:2; Heb 3:13-19; 4:7; Luke 19:41,42).","Since, therefore, things are thus, it may be convenient here to touch a little upon these particulars.","First, That this day, or time thus limited, when it is considered with reference to this or that man, is ofttimes undiscerned by the person concerned therein, and always is kept secret as to the shutting up thereof.","And this, in the wisdom of God is thus, to the end no man, when called upon, should put off turning to God to another time.","Now, and TODAY, is that and only that which is revealed in holy Writ (Psa 50:22; Eccl 12:1; Heb 3:13,15).","And this shows us the desperate hazards which those men run, who, when invitation or conviction attends them, put off turning to God to be saved till another, and, as they think, a more fit season and time.","For many, by so doing, defer this to do till the day of God's patience and long-suffering is ended; and then, for their prayers and cries after mercy, they receive nothing but mocks, and are laughed at by the God of heaven (Prov 1:20-30; Isa 65:12-16; 66:4; Zech 7:11-13).","Secondly, Another thing to be considered is this, namely, That the day of God's grace with some men begins sooner, and also sooner ends, than it doth with others.","Those at the first hour of the day, had their call sooner than they who were called upon to turn to God at the sixth hour of the day; yea, and they who were hired at the third hour, had their call sooner than they who were called at the eleventh (Matt 20:1-6).",1.,"The day of God's patience began with Ishmael, and also ended before he was twenty years old.","At thirteen years of age he was circumcised; the next year after, Isaac was born; and then Ishmael was fourteen years old.","Now, that day that Isaac was weaned, that day was Ishmael rejected; and suppose that Isaac was three years old before he was weaned, that was but the seventeenth year of Ishmael; wherefore the day of God's grace was ended with him betimes (Gen 17:25; 21:2-11; Gal 4:30).",2.,"Cain's day ended with him betimes; for, after God had rejected him, he lived to beget many children, and build a city, and to do many other things.","But, alas!",all that while he was a fugitive and a vagabond.,"Nor carried he anything with him after the day of his rejection was come, but this doleful language in his conscience.",'From God's face shall I be hid' (Gen 4:10-15).,3.,"Esau, through his extravagancies, would needs go sell his birthright, not fearing, as other confident fools, but that yet the blessing would still be his.","After which, he lived many years; but all of them under the wrath of God, as was, when time came, made to appear to his destruction; for, 'when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears' (Heb 12:16,17).","Many instances might be given as to such tokens of the displeasure of God against such as fool away, as the wise man has it, the prize which is put into their hand (Prov 17:16).","Let these things, therefore, be a further caution to those that sit under the glorious sound of the gospel, and hear of the riches of the grace of God in Christ to poor sinners.","To slight grace, to despise mercy, and to stop the ear when God speaks, when he speaks such great things, so much to our profit, is a great provocation.","He offereth, he calls, he woos, he invites, he prays, he beseeches us in this day of his grace to be reconciled to him; yea, and has provided for us the means of reconciliation himself.","Now, this despised must needs be provoking; and it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.",Objection.,"But some man may say unto me, 'Fain I would be saved, fain I would be saved by Christ; but I fear this day of grace is past, and that I shall perish, notwithstanding the exceeding riches of the grace of God.'",Answer.,To this doubt I would answer several things.,1.,With respect to this day.,2.,With respect to thy desires.,3.,With respect to thy fears.,1.,"With respect to this day; that is, whether it be ended with a man or no.",(1.),"Art thou jogged, and shaken, and molested at the hearing of the Word?","Is thy conscience awakened and convinced then, that thou art at present in a perishing state, and that thou hast need to cry to God for mercy?",This is a hopeful sign that this day of grace is not past with thee.,"For, usually, they that are past grace, are also, in their conscience, 'past feeling,' b eing 'seared with a hot iron' (Eph 4:18,19; 1 Tim 4:1,2).","Consequently, those past grace must be such as are denied the awakening fruits of the Word preached.","The dead that hear, says Christ, shall live; at least wise,40 Christ has not quite done with them; the day of God's patience is not at an end with them (John 5:25).",(2.),"Is there, in thy more retired condition, arguings, strugglings, and strivings with thy spirit to persuade thee of the vanity of what vain things thou lovest, and to win thee in thy soul to a choice of Christ Jesus and his heavenly things?","Take heed and rebel not, for the day of God's grace and patience will not be past with thee till he saith, his 'Spirit shall strive no more' with thee; for then the woe comes, when he shall depart from them; and when he says to the means of grace, Let them alone (Hosea 4:17; 9:12).",(3.),"Art thou visited in the night seasons with dreams about thy state, and that thou art in danger of being lost?","Hast thou heart-shaken apprehensions when deep sleep is upon thee, of hell, death, and judgment to come?","These are signs that God has not wholly left thee, or cast thee behind his back for ever.","'For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.","In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, that he may withdraw man from his purpose,' his sinful purposes, 'and hide pride from man' (Job 33:14-17).","All this while God has not left the sinner, nor is come to the end of his patience towards him, but stands, at least, with the door of grace ajar in his hand, as being loath, as yet, to bolt it against him.",(4.),"Art thou followed with affliction, and dost thou hear God's angry voice in thy afflictions?","Doth he send with the affliction an interpreter, to show thee thy vileness; and why, or wherefore, that hand of God is upon thee, and upon what thou hast; to wit, that it is for thy sinning against him, and that thou mightest be turned to him?","If so, thy summer is not quite ended; thy harvest is not yet quite over and gone.","Take heed, stand out no longer, lest he cause darkness, and lest thy feet stumble upon the dark mountains; and lest, while you look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness (Jer 8:20; 13:15-17).",(5.),"Art thou crossed, disappointed, and waylaid, and overthrown in all thy foolish ways and doings?","This is a sign God has not quite left thee, but that he still waits upon thee to turn thee.","Consider, I say, has he made a hedge and a wall to stop thee?",Has he crossed thee in all thou puttest thy hand unto?,"Take it as a call to turn to him; for, by his thus doing, he shows he has a mind to give thee a better portion.","For usually, when God gives up men, and resolves to let them alone in the broad way, he gives them rope, and lets them have their desires in all hurtful things (Hosea 2:6-15; Psa 73:3-13; Rom 11:9).","Therefore take heed to this also, that thou strive not against this hand of God; but betake thyself to a serious inquiry into the causes of this hand of God upon thee, and incline to think, it is because the Lord would have thee look to that, which is better than what thou wouldst satisfy thyself withal.","When God had a mind to make the prodigal go home to his father, he sent a famine upon him, and denied him a bellyful of the husks which the swine did eat.","And observe it, now he was in a strait, he betook him to consideration of the good that there was in his father's house; yea, he resolved to go home to his father, and his father dealt well with him; he received him with music and dancing, because he had received him safe and sound (Luke 15:14-32).",(6.),Hast thou any enticing touches of the Word of God upon thy mind?,"Doth, as it were, some holy word of God give a glance upon thee, cast a smile upon thee, let fall, though it be but one drop of its savour upon thy spirit; yea, though it stays but one moment with thee?",O then the day of grace is not past!,The gate of heaven is not shut!,nor God's heart and bowels withdrawn from thee as yet.,"Take heed, therefore, and beware that thou make much of the heavenly gift, and of that good word of God of the which he has made thee taste.","Beware, I say, and take heed; there may be a falling away for all this; but, I say, as yet God has not left thee, as yet he has not cast thee off (Heb 6:1-9).",2.,"With respect to thy desires, what are they?",Wouldst thou be saved?,Wouldst thou be saved with a thorough salvation?,Wouldst thou be saved from guilt and filth too?,Wouldst thou be the servant of thy Saviour?,"Art thou indeed weary of the service of thy old master the devil, sin, and the world?",And have these desires put thy soul to the flight?,"Hast thou, through desires, betaken thyself to thy heels?","Dost fly to him that is a Saviour from the wrath to come, for life?","If these be thy desires, and if they be unfeigned, fear not!","Thou are one of those runaways which God has commanded our Lord to receive, and not to send thee back to the devil thy master again, but to give thee a place in his house, even the place which liketh thee best.","'Thou shalt not deliver unto his master,' says he, 'the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee.","He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him' (Deu 23:15,16).","This is a command to the church, consequently to the Head of the church; for all commands from God come to her through her Head.","Whence I conclude, that as Israel of old was to receive the runaway servant who escaped from a heathen master to them, and should not dare to send him back to his master again; so Christ's church now, and consequently Christ himself, may not, will not, refuse that soul that has made his escape from sin, Satan, the world, and hell, unto him, but will certainly let him dwell in his house, among his saints, in that place which he shall choose, even where it liketh him best.","For he says, in another place, 'And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.'","In no wise, let his crimes be what they will, either for nature, multitude, or the attendance of aggravating circumstances.","Wherefore, if thy desires be firm, sound, and unfeigned to become the saved of Christ, and his servant, fear not, he will not, he will in no wise put thee away, or turn thee over to thy old master again.",3.,"As to thy fears, whatever they are, let that be supposed which is supposed before, and they are groundless, and so of no weight.",Objection.,"But I am afraid I am not [of the] elect, or chosen to salvation, though you called me fool a little before for so fearing.",Answer.,"Though election is, in order, before calling, as to God, yet the knowledge of calling must go before the belief of my election, as to myself.","Wherefore, souls that doubt of the truth of their effectual calling, do but plunge themselves into a deeper labyrinth of confusion that concern themselves with their election; I mean, while they labour to know it before they prove their calling.","'Make your calling, and so your election sure' (2 Peter 1:4-10).","Wherefore, at present, lay the thoughts of thy election by, and ask thyself these questions: Do I see my lost condition?",Do I see salvation is nowhere but in Christ?,Would I share in this salvation by faith in him?,"And would I, as was said before, be thoroughly saved, to wit, from the filth as from the guilt?","Do I love Christ, his Father, his saints, his words, and ways?",This is the way to prove we are elect.,"Wherefore, sinner, when Satan, or thine own heart, seeks to puzzle thee with election, say thou, I cannot attend to talk of this point now, but stay till I know that I am called of God to the fellowship of his Son, and then I will show you that I am elect, and that my name is written in the book of life.","If poor distressed souls would observe this order, they might save themselves the trouble of an unprofitable labour under these unseasonable and soul-sinking doubts.","41 Let us, therefore, upon the sight of our wretchedness, fly and venturously leap into the arms of Christ, which are now as open to receive us into his bosom as they were when nailed to the cross.","This is coming to Christ for life aright; this is right running away from thy [old] master to him, as was said before.","And for this we have multitudes of Scriptures to support, encourage, and comfort us in our so doing.","But now, let him that doth thus be sure to look for it, for Satan will be with him tomorrow, to see if he can get him again to his old service; and if he cannot do that, then will he enter into dispute with him, to wit, about whether he be elect to life, and called indeed to partake of this Christ, to whom he is fled for succour, or whether he comes to him of his own presumptuous mind.","Therefore we are bid, as to come, so to arm ourselves with that armour which God has provided; that we may resist, quench, stand against, and withstand all the fiery darts of the devil (Eph 6:11-18).","If, therefore, thou findest Satan in this order to march against thee, remember that thou hadst this item about it; and betake thyself to faith and good courage, and be sober, and hope to the end.",Objection.,"But how if I should have sinned the sin unpardonable, or that called the sin against the Holy Ghost?",Answer.,"If thou hast, thou art lost for ever; but yet before it is concluded by thee that thou hast so sinned, know that they that would be saved by Jesus Christ, through faith in his blood, cannot be counted for such.",1.,"Because of the promise, for that must not be frustrate: and that says, 'And him that cometh to Christ, he will in no wise cast out.'","And again, 'Whoso will, let him take of the water of life freely' (John 6:37; Rev 21:6; 22:17).","But, I say, how can these Scriptures be fulfilled, if he that would indeed be saved, as before said, has sinned the sin unpardonable?","The Scripture must not be made void, nor their truth be cast to the ground.","Here is a promise, and here is a sinner; a promise that says he shall not be cast out that comes; and the sinner comes, wherefore he must be received: consequently, he that comes to Christ for life, has not, cannot have sinned that sin for which there is no forgiveness.","And this might suffice for an answer to any coming soul, that fears, though he comes, that he has sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost.",2.,"But, again, he that has sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost cannot come, has no heart to come, can by no means be made willing to come to Jesus Christ for life; for that he has received such an opinion of him, and of his things, as deters and holds him back.",(1.),"He counteth this blessed person, this Son of God, a magician, a conjuror, a witch, or one that did, when he was in the world, what he did, by the power and spirit of the devil (Matt 9:34; 12:24,25,&c.",; Mark 3:22-30).,"Now he that has this opinion of this Jesus, cannot be willing to cast himself at his feet for life, or to come to him as the only way to God and to salvation.","And hence it is said again, that such an one puts him to open shame, and treadeth him under foot; that is, by contemning, reproaching, vilifying, and despising of him, as if he were the vilest one, or the greatest cheat in the world; and has, therefore, as to his esteem of him, called him accursed, crucified him to himself, or counted him one hanged, as one of the worst of malefactors (Heb 6:6; 10:29; 1 Cor 12:3).",(2.),"His blood, which is the meritorious cause of man's redemption, even the blood of the everlasting covenant, he counteth 'an unholy thing,' or that which has no more virtue in it to save a soul from sin than has the blood of a dog (Heb 10:29).42 For when the apostle says, 'he counts it an unholy thing,' he means, he makes it of less value than that of a sheep or cow, which were clean according to the law; and, therefore, must mean, that his blood was of no more worth to him, in his account, than was the blood of a dog, an ass, or a swine, which always was, as to sacrifices, rejected by the God of heaven, as unholy or unclean.","Now he who has no better esteem of Jesus Christ, and of his death and blood, will not be persuaded to come to him for life, or to trust in him for salvation.",(3.),"But further, all this must be done against manifest tokens to prove the contrary, or after the shining of gospel light upon the soul, or some considerable profession of him as the Messiah, or that he was the Saviour of the world.",(a.),"It must be done against manifest tokens to prove the contrary; and thus the reprobate Jews committed it when they saw the works of God, which put forth themselves in him, and called them the works of the devil and Beelzebub.",(b.),It must be done against some shining light of the gospel upon them.,"And thus it was with Judas, and with those who, after they were enlightened, and had tasted, and had felt something of the powers of the world to come, fell away from the faith of him, and put him to open shame and disgrace (Heb 6:5,6).","(c.) It must also be done after, and in opposition to one's own open profession of him.","For if, after they have escaped the pollution of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning; for it had been better for them not to have know the way of righteousness, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment, which is the word of faith delivered unto them.","(d.) All this must be done openly, before witnesses, in the face, sight, and view of the world, by word and act.","This is the sin that is unpardonable; and he that hath thus done, can never, it is impossible he ever should, be renewed again to repentance, and that for a double reason; first, such an one doth say, he will not; and [second] of him God says, he shall not have the benefit of salvation by him.",Objection.,"But if this be the sin unpardonable, why is it called the sin against the Holy Ghost, and not rather the sin against the Son of God?",Answer.,"It is called 'the sin against the Holy Ghost,' because such count the works he did, which were done by the Spirit of God, the works of the spirit of the devil.","Also because all such as so reject Christ Jesus the Lord, they do it in despite of that testimony which the Holy Ghost has given of him in the holy Scriptures; for the Scriptures are the breathings of the Holy Ghost, as in all other things, so in that testimony they bear of the person, of the works, sufferings, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ.","Sinner, this is the sin against the Holy Ghost.",What sayest thou?,Hast thou committed it?,"Nay, I know thou hast not, if thou wouldst be saved by Christ.","Yea, it is impossible that thou shouldst have done it, if indeed thou wouldst be saved by him.","No man can desire to be saved by him, who he yet judgeth to be an impostor, a magician, a witch.",No man can hope for redemption by that blood which he yet counteth an unholy thing.,"Nor will God ever suffer such an one to repent, who has, after light and profession of him, thus horribly, and devil-like, contemned and trampled upon him.","True, words, and wars, and blasphemies, against this Son of man, are pardonable; but then they must be done 'ignorantly, and in unbelief.'","Also, all blasphemous thoughts are likewise such as may be passed by, if the soul afflicted with them, indeed is sorry for them (1 Tim 1:13-15; Mark 3:28).","All but this, sinner, all but this!","If God had said, he will forgive one sin, it had been undeserved grace; but when he says he will pardon all but one, this is grace to the height.","Nor is that one unpardonable otherwise, but because the Saviour that should save them is rejected and put away.","Jacob's ladder; Christ is Jacob's ladder that reacheth up to heaven; and he that refuseth to go by this ladder thither, will scarce by other means get up so high.","There is none other name given under heaven, among men, whereby we must be saved.","There is none other sacrifice for sin than this; he also, and he only, is the Mediator that reconcileth men to God.","And, sinner, if thou wouldst be saved by him, his benefits are thine; yea, though thou art a great and Jerusalem transgressor.43 FOOTNOTES: 1 Having preached many times, and from various texts, upon this subject, the whole substance of many sermons is here published.--Ed.","2 The Jews, and their sacred city, are standing monuments of God's dreadful vengeance against unbelief in rejecting the Lord Christ, in whom alone is salvation.","The Lord give us grace to prize and improve gospel privileges, lest we also be cut off, through unbelief.--Mason.","3 The higher a people rise under the means, the lower will be their fall if they slight them.",O highly-favoured England!,"Tyre and Sidon, Sodom and Gomorrah, will have a milder hell than thy carnal, hypocritical, Christless children.--Mason.","4 All the objections are on the sinner's side, through unbelief.","Christ answers them all in one word, 'Whosoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely';

WITH THE CAUSES OF THE LOSING IT.",FIRST PREACHED AT PINNER'S HALL and now ENLARGED AND PUBLISHED FOR GOOD.,"By JOHN BUNYAN, London: Printed for Benjamin Alsop, at the Angel and Bible in the Poultry, 1682 Faithfully reprinted from the Author's First Edition.",ADVERTISEMENT BY THE EDITOR.,"Our curiosity is naturally excited to discover what a poor, unlettered mechanic, whose book-learning had been limited to the contents of one volume, could by possibility know upon a subject so abstruse, so profound, and so highly metaphysical, as that of the Soul--its greatness--and the inconceivableness of its loss.","Heathen philosophers, at the head of whose formidable array stand Plato and Aristotle, had exhausted their wit, and had not made the world a whit the wiser by all their lucubrations.","The fathers plunged into the subject, and increased the confusion; we are confounded with their subtle distinctions, definitions, and inquiries; such as that attributed to St. Aquinas, How many disembodied spirits could dance upon the point of a fine needle without jostling each other?",Learned divines had puzzled themselves and their hearers with suppositions and abstract principles.,"What, then, could a travelling brasier, or tinker, have discovered to excite the attention of the Christian world, and to become a teacher to philosophers, fathers, and learned divines?","Bunyan found no access to the polluted streams of a vain philosophy; he went at once to the fountain-head; and, in the pure light of Revelation, displays the human soul--infinitely great in value, although in a fallen state.",He portrays it as drawn by the unerring hand of its Maker.,"He sets forth, by the glass of God's Word, the inconceivableness of its value, while progressing through time; and, aided by the same wondrous glass, he penetrates the eternal world, unveils the joys of heaven and the torments of hell--so far as they are revealed by the Holy Ghost, and are conceivable to human powers.","While he thus leads us to some kind of estimate of its worth, he, from the same source--the only source from whence such knowledge can be derived, makes known the causes of the loss of the soul, and leads his trembling readers to the only name under heaven given among men, whereby they can be saved.","In attempting to conceive the greatness and value of the soul, the importance of the body is too often overlooked.","The body, it is true, is of the earth; the soul is the breath of God.",The body is the habitation; the soul is the inhabitant.,"The body returns to the dust; while the soul enters into the intermediate state, waiting to be re-united to the body after its new creation, when death shall be swallowed up of life.","In these views, the soul appears to be vastly superior to the body.","But let it never be forgotten, that, as in this life, so it will be in the everlasting state; the body and soul are so intimately connected as to become one being, capable of exquisite happiness, or existing in the pangs of everlasting death.","He who felt and wrote as Bunyan does in this solemn treatise, and whose tongue was as the pen of a ready writer, must have been wise and successful in winning souls to Christ.","He felt their infinite value, he knew their strong and their weak points, their riches and poverty.","He was intimate with every street and lane in the town of Man-soul, and how and where the subtle Diabolians shifted about to hide themselves in the walls, and holes, and corners.","He sounds the alarm, and plants his engines against 'the eye as the window, and the ear as the door, for the soul to look out at, and to receive in by.'","He detects the wicked in speaking with his feet, and teaching with his fingers.","His illustration of the punishment of a sinner, as set forth by the sufferings of the Saviour, is peculiarly striking.","The attempt to describe the torments of those who suffer under the awful curse, 'Go ye wicked,' is awfully and intensely vivid.","Bunyan most earnestly exhorts the distressed sinner to go direct to the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls, and not to place confidence in those who pretend to be his ministers; but 'who are false shepherds, in so many ugly guises, and under so many false and scandalous dresses;' 'take heed of that shepherd that careth not for his own soul, that walketh in ways, and doth such things, as have a direct tendency to damn his own soul; come not near him.","He that feeds his own soul with ashes, will scarce feed thee with the bread of life.'","Choose Christ to be thy chief Shepherd, sit at his feet, and learn of him and he will direct thee to such as shall feed thy soul with knowledge and understanding.","Reader, let me no longer keep thee upon the threshold but enter upon this important treatise with earnest prayer; and may the blessed Spirit enable us to live under a sense of the greatness of the soul, the unspeakableness of the loss thereof, the causes of losing it, and the only way in which its salvation can he found.",GEORGE OFFOR.,"Hackney, April 1850 THE GREATNESS OF THE SOUL, AND UNSPEAKABLENESS OF THE LOSS THEREOF 'OR WHAT SHALL A MAN GIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS SOUL?'",--MARK 8:37.,"I HAVE chosen at this time to handle these words among you, and that for several reasons:-- l. Because the soul, and the salvation of it, are such great, such wonderful great things; nothing is a matter of that concern as is, and should be, the soul of each one of you.","House and land, trades and honours, places and preferments, what are they to salvation?",to the salvation of the soul?,2.,"Because I perceive that this so great a thing, and about which persons should be so much concerned, is neglected to amazement, and that by the most of men; yea, who is there of the many thousands that sit daily under the sound of the gospel that are concerned, heartily concerned, about the salvation of their souls?--that is, concerned, I say, as the nature of the thing requireth.","If ever a lamentation was fit to be taken up in this age about, for, or concerning anything, it is about, for, and concerning the horrid neglect that everywhere puts forth itself with reference to salvation.","Where is one man in a thousand--yea, where is there two of ten thousand that do show by their conversation, public and private, that the soul, their own souls, are considered by them, and that they are taking that care for the salvation of them as becomes them--to wit, as the weight of the work, and the nature of salvation requireth?",3.,"I have therefore pitched upon this text at this time; to see, if peradventure the discourse which God shall help me to make upon it, will awaken you, rouse you off your beds of ease, security, and pleasure, and fetch you down upon your knees before Him, to beg of Him grace to be concerned about the salvation of your souls.","And then, in the last place, I have taken upon me to do this, that I may deliver, if not you, yet myself, and that I may be clear of your blood, and stand quit, as to you, before God, when you shall, for neglect, be damned, and wail to consider that you have lost your souls.","'When I say,' saith God, 'unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou,' the prophet or preacher, 'givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.","Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not front his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul' (Eze 3:18, 19).",'Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?',"In my handling of these words, I shall first speak to the occasion of them, and then to the words themselves.","The occasion of the words was, for that the people that now were auditors to the Lord Jesus, and that followed him, did it without that consideration as becomes so great a work--that is, the generality of them that followed Him were not for considering first with themselves, what it was to profess Christ, and what that profession might cost them.","'And when he had called the people unto him,' the great multitude that went with him (Luke14:25) 'with his disciples also, he said unto them, 'Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me (Mark 8:34).","Let him first sit down and count up the cost, and the charge he is like to be at, if he follows me.",For following of me is not like following of some other masters.,"The wind sits always on my face, and the foaming rage of the sea of this world, and the proud and lofty waves thereof, do continually beat upon the sides of the bark of the ship that myself, my cause, and my followers are in; he therefore that will not run hazards, and that is afraid to venture a drowning, let him not set foot into this vessel.","So whosever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, he cannot be my disciple.","For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it (Luke 14:27-29).","True, to reason, this kind of language tends to cast water upon weak and beginning desires, but to faith, it makes the things set before us, and the greatness, and the glory of them, more apparently excellent and desirable.","Reason will say, Then who will profess Christ that hath such coarse entertainment at the beginning?","but faith will say, Then surely the things that are at the end of a Christian's race in this world must needs be unspeakably glorious; since whoever hath had but the knowledge and due consideration of them, have not stuck to run hazards, hazards of every kind, that they might embrace and enjoy them.","Yea, saith faith, it must needs be so, since the Son himself, that best knew what they were, even, 'for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God' (Heb 12:2).","But, I say, there is not in every man this knowledge of things and so by consequence not such consideration as can make the cross and self-denial acceptable to them for the sake of Christ, and of the things that are where He now sitteth at the right hand of God (Col 3:2-4).",Therefore our Lord Jesus doth even at the beginning give to His followers this instruction.,"And lest any of them should take distaste at His saying, He presenteth them with the consideration of three things together--namely, the cross, the loss of life, and the soul; and then reasoneth with them from the same, saying, Here is the cross, the life, and the soul.",1.,"The cross, and that you must take up, if you will follow Me.",2.,"The life, and that you may save for a time, if you cast Me off.",3.,"And the soul, which will everlastingly perish if you come not to Me, and abide not with Me.",Now consider what is best to be done.,"Will you take up the cross, come after Me, and so preserve your souls from perishing?","or will you shun the cross to save your lives, and so run the danger of eternal damnation?","Or, as you have it in John, will you love your life till you lose it?","or will you hate your life, and save it?",'He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal' (John 12:25).,"As who should say, He that loveth a temporal life, he that so loveth it, as to shun the profession of Christ to save it, shall lose it upon a worse account, than if he had lost it for Christ and the gospel; but he that will set light by it, for the love that he hath to Christ, shall keep it unto life eternal.","Christ having thus discoursed with His followers about their denying of themselves, their taking up their cross and following of Him, doth, in the next place, put the question to them, and so leaveth it upon them for ever, saying, 'For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?'",(Mark 8:36).,"As who should say, I have bid you take heed that you do not lightly, and without due consideration, enter into a profession of Me and of My gospel; for he that without due consideration shall begin to profess Christ, will also without it forsake Him, turn from Him, and cast Him behind his back; and since I have even at the beginning, laid the consideration of the cross before you, it is because you should not be surprised and overtaken by it unawares, and because you should know that to draw back from Me after you have laid your hand to My plough, will make you unfit for the kingdom of heaven (Luke 9:62).","Now, since this is so, there is no less lies at stake than salvation, and salvation is worth all the world, yea, worth ten thousand worlds, if there should be so many.","And since this is so also, it will be your wisdom to begin to profess the gospel with expectation of the cross and tribulation, for to that are my gospellers1 in this world appointed (James 1:12; 1 Thess 3:3).","And if you begin thus, and hold it, the kingdom and crown shall be yours; for as God counteth it a righteous thing to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you, so to you who are troubled and endure it, for 'we count them happy,' says James, 'that endure,' (James 5:11), rest with saints, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, to take vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel, etc.","(2 Thess 1:7, 8).","And if no less lies at stake than salvation, then is a man's soul and his all at the stake; and if it be so, what will it profit a man if, by forsaking of Me, he should get the whole world?","'For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?'","Having thus laid the soul in one balance, and the world in the other, and affirmed that the soul out-bids the whole world, and is incomparably for value and worth beyond it; in the next place, he descends to a second question, which is that I have chosen at this time for my text, saying, 'Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'","In these words, we have first a supposition, and such an one as standeth upon a double bottom.",The supposition is this--That the soul is capable of being lost; or thus--'Tis possible for a man to lose his soul.,"The double bottom that this supposition is grounded upon is, first, a man's ignorance of the worth of his soul, and of the danger that it is in; and the second is, for that men commonly do set a higher price upon present ease and enjoyments than they do upon eternal salvation.","The last of these doth naturally follow upon the first; for if men be ignorant of the value and worth of their souls, as by Christ in the verse before is implied, what should hinder but that men should set a higher esteem upon that with which their carnal desires are taken, than upon that about which they are not concerned, and of which they know not the worth.","But again, as this by the text is clearly supposed, so to here is also something implied; namely, that it is impossible to possess some men with the worth of their souls until they are utterly and everlastingly lost.",'What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?',"That is, men when their souls are lost, and shut down under the hatches in the pits and hells in endless perdition and destruction, then they will see the worth of their souls, then they will consider what they have lost, and truly not till then.","This is plain, not only to sense, but by the natural scope of the words, 'What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'","Or what would not those that are now for sin, made to see themselves lost, by the light of hell fire--for some will never be convinced that they are lost till, with rich Dives, they see it in the light of hell flames (Luke 16:22, 23).","I say, what would not such, if they had it, give in exchange for their immortal souls, or to recover them again from that place and torment?2 I shall observe two truths in the words.","The first is, That the loss of the soul is the highest, the greatest loss--a loss that can never be repaired or made up.",'What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?',"--that is, to recover or redeem his lost soul to liberty?","The second truth is this, That how unconcerned and careless soever some now be, about the loss or salvation of their souls, yet the day is coming; but it will then be too late, when men will be willing, had they never so much, to give it all in exchange for their souls.",For so the question implies--'What will a man give in exchange for his soul?',What would he not give?,"What would he not part with at that day, the day in which he will see himself damned, if he had it, in exchange for his soul?","The first observation, or truth, drawn from the words is cleared by the text, 'What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'","--that is, there is not anything, nor all the things under heaven, were they all in one man's hand, and all at his disposal, that would go in exchange for the soul, that would be of value to fetch back one lost soul, or that would certainly recover it from the confines of hell.","'The redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever' (Psa 49:8).","And what saith the words before the text but the same--'For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?'",What shall profit a man that has lost his soul?,"Nothing at all, though he hath by that loss gained the whole world; for all the world is not worth a sou1, not worth a soul in the eye of God and judgment of the law.","And it is from this consideration that good Elihu cautioneth Job to take heed, 'Because there is wrath,' saith he, 'beware lest He take thee away with His stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.",Will He esteem thy riches?,"no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength' (Job 36:18,19).","Riches and power, what is there more in the world?","for money answereth all things--that is, all but soul concerns.","It can neither be a price for souls while here, nor can that, with all the forces of strength, recover one out of hell fire.",DOCTRINE FIRST.,"So then, the first truth drawn from the words stands firm--namely, That the loss of the soul is the highest, the greatest loss; a loss that can never be repaired or made up.","In my discourse upon this subject, I shall observe this method:-- FIRST, I shall show you what the soul is.","SECOND, I shall show you the greatness of it.","THIRD, I shall show you what it is to lose the soul.","FOURTH, I shall show you the cause for which men lose their souls; and by this time the greatness of the loss will be manifest.",[WHAT THE SOUL IS.],"FIRST, I shall show you what the soul is, both as to the various names it goes under, as also, by describing of it by its powers and properties, though in all I shall be but brief, for I intend no long discourse.3 [Names of the Soul.]",1.,"The soul is often called the heart of man, or that, in and by which things to either good or evil, have their rise; thus desires are of the heart or soul; yea, before desires, the first conception of good or evil is in the soul, the heart.","The heart understands, wills, affects, reasons, judges, but these are the faculties of the soul; wherefore, heart and soul are often taken for one and the same.","'My son, give me thine heart' (Prov 23:26).","'Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,' etc.",(Matt 15:19; 1 Peter 3:15; Psa 26:2).,2.,"The soul of man is often called the spirit of a man; because it not only giveth being, but life to all things and actions in and done by him.","Hence soul and spirit are put together, as to the same notion.","'With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early' (Isa 26:9).","When he saith, 'Yea, with my spirit--will I seek thee,' he explaineth not only with what kind of desires he desired God, but with what principal matter his desires were brought forth.","It was with my soul, saith he; to wit, with my spirit within me.","So that of Mary, 'My soul,' saith she, 'doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour' (Luke 1:46,47).","Not that soul and spirit are, in this place, to be taken for two superior powers in man; but the same great soul is here put under two names, or terms, to show that it was the principal part in Mary; to wit, her soul, that magnified God, even that part that could spirit and put life into her whole self to do it.","Indeed, sometimes spirit is not taken so largely, but is confined to some one power or faculty of the soul, as 'the spirit of my understanding,' (Job 20:3) 'and be renewed in the spirit of your mind.'","And sometime by spirit we are to understand other things; but many times by spirit we must understand the soul, and also by soul the spirit.",3.,"Therefore, by soul we understand the spiritual, the best, and most noble part of man, as distinct from the body, even that by which we understand, imagine, reason, and discourse.","And, indeed, as I shall further show you presently, the body is but a poor, empty vessel, without this great thing called the soul.","'The body without the spirit,' or soul, 'is dead' (James 2:26).","Or nothing but (her soul departed from her, for she died).","It is, therefore, the chief and most noble part of man.",4.,"The soul is often called the life of man, not a life of the same stamp and nature of the brute; for the life of man--that is, of the rational creature--is, that, as he is such, wherein consisteth and abideth the understanding and conscience etc.","Wherefore, then, a man dieth, or the body ceaseth to act, or live in the exercise of the thoughts, which formerly used to be in him, when the soul departeth, as I hinted even now--her soul departed from her, for she died; and, as another good man saith, 'in that very day his thoughts perish,' etc.",(Psa 146:4).,The first text is more emphatical; Her soul was in departing (for she died).,"There is the soul of a beast, a bird, etc., but the soul of a man is another thing; it is his understanding, and reason, and conscience, etc.","And this soul, when it departs, he dies.","Nor is this life, when gone out of the body, annihilate, as is the life of a beast; no, this, in itself, is immortal, and has yet a place and being when gone out of the body it dwelt in; yea, as quick, as lively is it in its senses, if not far more abundant, than when it was in the body; but I call it the life, because so long as that remains in the body, the body is not dead.","And in this sense it is to be taken where he saith 'He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it' unto life eternal; and this is the soul that is intended in the text, and not the breath, as in some other places is meant.","And this is evident, because the man has a being, a sensible being, after he has lost the soul.","I mean not by the man a man in this world, nor yet in the body, or in the grave; but by man we must understand, either the soul in hell, or body and soul there, after the judgment is over.","And for this the text, also, is plain, for therein we are presented with a man sensible of the damage that he has sustained by losing of his soul.",'What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?',"But, 5.","The whole man goeth under this denomination; man, consisting of body and soul, is yet called by that part of himself that is most chief and principal.","'Let every soul,' that is, let every man, 'be subject unto the higher powers' (Rom 13:1).","'Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, three-score and fifteen souls (Acts 7:14).","By both these, and several other places, the whole man is meant, and is also so to be taken in the text; for whereas here he saith, 'What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?'","It is said elsewhere, 'For what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world, and lose himself?'","(Luke 9:25) and so, consequently, or, 'What shall a man give in exchange (for himself) for his soul?'","His soul when he dies, and body and soul in and after judgment.",6.,The soul is called the good man's darling.,"'Deliver,' Lord, saith David, 'my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog' (Psa 22:20).","So, again, in another place, he saith, 'Lord, how long wilt thou look on?","rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the [power of the] lions' (Psa 35:17).","My darling--this sentence must not be applied universally, but only to those in whose eyes their souls, and the redemption thereof, is precious.","My darling--most men do, by their actions, say of their soul, 'my drudge, my slave; nay, thou slave to the devil and sin; for what sin, what lust, what sensual and beastly lust is there in the world that some do not cause their souls to bow before and yield unto?","But David, here, as you see, calls it his darling, or his choice and most excellent thing; for, indeed, the soul is a choice thing in itself, and should, were all wise, be every man's darling, or chief treasure.","And that it might be so with us, therefore, our Lord Jesus hath thus expressed the worth of the soul, saying, 'What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'","But if this is true, one may see already what misery he is like to sustain that has, or shall lose his soul; he has lost his heart, his spirit, his best part, his life, his darling, himself, his whole self, and so, in every sense, his all.","And now, 'what shall a man,' what would a man, but what can a man that has lost his soul, himself, and his all, 'give in exchange for his soul?'","Yea, what shall the man that has sustained this loss do to recover all again, since this man, or the man put under this question, must needs be a man that is gone from hence, a man that is cast in the judgment, and one that is gone down the throat of hell?","But to pass this, and to proceed.",[Powers and Properties of the Soul.],"I come next to describe the soul unto you by such things as it is set out by in the Holy Scriptures, and they are, in general, three--First, The powers of the soul.","Second, The senses, the spiritual senses of the soul.","Third, The passions of the soul.",Of the powers of the soul.,"First, We will discourse of the powers, I may call them the members of the soul; for, as the members of the body, being many, do all go to the making up of the body, so these do go to the completing of the soul.",1.,"There is the understanding, which may be termed the head; because in that is placed the eye of the soul; and this is that which, or by which the soul, discerning things that are presented to it, and that either by God or Satan; this is that by which a man conceiveth and apprehendeth things so deep and great that cannot, by mouth, or tongue, or pen, be expressed.",2.,"There is, also, belonging to the soul, the conscience, in which I may say, is placed the Seat of Judgment; for, as by the understanding things are let into the soul, so by the conscience the evil or good of such things are tried; especially when in the 3.","Third place, there is the judgment, which is another part of this noble creature, has passed, by the light of the understanding, his verdict upon what is let into the soul.4 4.","There is, also, the fancy or imagination, another part of this great thing, the sou1: and a most curious thing this fancy is; it is that which presenteth to the man the idea, form, or figure of that, or any of those things, wherewith a man is either frighted or taken, pleased or displeased.","And, 5.","The mind, another part of the soul, is that unto which this fancy presenteth its things to be considered of; because without the mind nothing is entertained in the soul.",6.,"There is the memory too, another part of the soul; and that may be called the register of the soul; for it is the memory that receiveth and keepeth in remembrance what has passed, or has been done by the man, or attempted to be done unto him; and in this part of the soul, or from it, will be fed 'the worm that dieth not,' when men are cast into hell; also, from this memory will flow that peace at the day of judgment that saints shall have in their service for Christ in the world.",7.,"There are the affections too, which are, as I may call them, the hands and arms of the soul; for they are they that take hold of, receive, and embrace what is liked by the soul, and it is a hard thing to make the soul of a man cast from it what its affections cleave to and have embraced.","Hence the affections are called for, when the apostle bids men 'seek the things above; set your affections upon them,' saith he (Col 3), or, as you have it in another place, 'Lay hold' of them; for the affections are as hands to the soul, and they by which it fasteneth upon things.",8.,"There is the will, which may be called the foot of the soul, because by that the soul, yea, the whole man, is carried hither and thither, or else held back and kept from moving.5 These are the golden things of the soul, though, in carnal men, they are every one of them made use of in the service of sin and Satan.","For the unbelieving are throughout impure, as is manifest, because their 'mind and conscience (two of the masterpieces of the soul) is defiled' (Titus 1:15).","For if the most potent parts of the soul are engaged in their service, what, think you, do the more inferior do?","But, I say, so it is the more is the pity; nor can any help it.","'This work ceaseth for ever,' unless the great God, who is over all, and that can save souls, shall himself take upon him to sanctify the soul, and to recover it, and persuade it to fall in love with another master.","But, I say, what is man without this soul, or wherein lieth this pre-eminence over a beast?",(Eccl 3:19-21).,"Nowhere that I know of; for both, as to man's body, go to one place, only the spirit or soul of a man goes upward--to wit, to God that gave it, to be by Him disposed of with respect to things to come, as they have been, and have done in this life, But, Of the senses of the soul.","Second, I come, in the next place, to describe the soul by its senses, its spiritual senses, for so I call them; for as the body hath senses pertaining to it, and as it can see, hear, smell, feel, and taste, so can the soul; I call, therefore, these the senses of the soul, in opposition to the senses of the body, and because the soul is the seat of all spiritual sense, where supernatural things are known and enjoyed; not that the soul of a natural man is spiritual in the apostle's sense, for so none are, but those that are born from above (1 Cor 3:1-3) nor they so always neither.",But to go forward.,Of sight.,1.,Can the body see?,hath it eyes?,so hath the soul.,'The eyes of your understanding being enlightened' (Eph 1:18).,"As, then, the body can see beasts, trees, men, and all visible things, so the soul can see God, Christ, angels, heaven, devils, hell, and other things that are invisible; nor is this property only peculiar to the souls that are illuminate by the Holy Ghost, for the most carnal soul in the world shall have a time to see these things, but not to its comfort, but not to its joy, but to its endless woe and misery, it dying in that condition.","Wherefore, sinner, say not thou, 'I shall not see Him; for judgment is before Him,' and He will make thee see Him (Job 35:14).",Of hearing.,2.,Can the body hear?,hath it ears?,"so hath the soul (Job 4:12,13).","It is the soul, not the body, that hears the language of things invisible.",It is the soul that hears God when He speaks in and by His Word and Spirit; and it is the soul that hears the devil when he speaks by his illusions and temptations.,"True, there is such an union between the soul and the body, that ofttimes, if not always, that which is heard by the ears of the body doth influence the soul, and that which is heard by the soul doth also influence the body; but yet as to the organ of hearing, the body hath one of its own, distinct from that of the soul, and the soul can hear and regard even then, when the body doth not nor cannot; as in time of sleep, deep sleep and trances, when the body lieth by as a thing that is useless.","'For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man, (as to his body) perceiveth it not.","In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,' etc.",(Job 33:14-16).,"This must be meant of the ears of the soul, not of the body; for that at this time is said to be in deep sleep; moreover this hearing, it is a hearing of dreams, and the visions of the night.",Jeremiah also tells us that he had the rare and blessed visions of God in his sleep (Jer 21:26).,"And so doth Daniel too, by the which they were greatly comforted and refreshed; but that could not be, was not the soul also capable of hearing.","'I heard the voice of His words,' said Daniel, 'and when I heard the voice of His words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground' (Dan 10:8,9).",Of tasting.,3.,"As the soul can see and hear, so it can taste and relish, even as really as doth the palate belonging to the body.6 But then the things so tasted must be that which is suited to the temper and palate of the soul.","The soul's taste lieth not in, nor is exercised about meats, the meats that are for the belly.","Yet the soul of a saint can taste and relish God's Word (Heb 6:5), and doth ofttimes find it sweeter than honey (Psa 19:10) nourishing as milk (1 Peter 2:2), and strengthening like to strong meat (Heb 5:12-14).","The soul also of sinners, and of those that are unsanctified, can taste and relish, though not the things now mentioned, yet things that agree with their fleshly minds, and with their polluted, and defiled, and vile affections.","They can relish and taste that which delighteth them; yea, they can find soul-delight in an alehouse, a whorehouse, a playhouse.","Ay, they find pleasure in the vilest things, in the things most offensive to God, and that are most destructive to themselves.","This is evident to sense, and is proved by the daily practice of sinners.",Nor is the Word barren as to this: They 'feed on ashes' (Isa 44:20).,They 'spend their money for that which is not bread' (Isa 55:2).,"Yea, they eat and suck sweetness out of sin.",'They eat up the sin of My people' as they eat bread (Hosea 4:8).,Of smelling.,4.,"As the soul can see, hear, and taste, so it can smell, and brings refreshment to itself that way.","Hence the church saith, 'My fingers dropped with sweet-smelling myrrh;' and again, she saith of her beloved, that 'his lips dropped sweet-smelling-myrrh' (Song 5:5,13).","But how came the church to understand this, but because her soul did smell that in it that was to be smelled in it, even in his word and gracious visits?","The poor world, indeed, cannot smell, or savour anything of the good and fragrant scent and sweet that is in Christ; but to them that believe, 'Thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee' (Song 1:3).",Of feeling.,5.,"As the soul can see, taste, hear, and smell, so it hath the sense of feeling, as quick and as sensible as the body.","He knows nothing that knows not this; he whose soul is 'past feeling,' has his 'conscience seared with a hot iron' (Eph 4:18, 19; 1 Tim 4:2).","Nothing so sensible as the soul, nor feeleth so quickly the love and mercy, or the anger and wrath of God.","Ask the awakened man, or the man that is under the convictions of the law, if he doth not feel?","and he will quickly tell you that he faints and dies away by reason of God's hand, and His wrath that lieth upon him.","Read the first eight verses of the 38th Psalm; if thou knowest nothing of what I have told thee by experience; and there thou shalt hear the complaints of one whose soul lay at present under the burden of guilt, and that cried out that without help from heaven he could by no means bear the same.","They also that know what the peace of God means, and what an eternal weight there is in glory know well that the soul has the sense of feeling, as well as the senses of seeing, hearing, tasting, and smelling.",But thus much for the senses of the soul.,Of the passions of the soul.,"Third, I come, in the next place, to describe the soul by the passions of the soul.","The passions of the soul, I reckon, are these, and such like--to wit, love, hatred, joy, fear, grief, anger, etc.","And these passions of the soul are not therefore good, nor therefore evil, because they are the passions of the soul, but are made so by two things--to wit, principle and object.","The principle I count that from whence they flow, and the object that upon which they are pitched.",To explain myself.,Of love.,1.,For that of love.,"This is a strong passion; the Holy Ghost saith 'it is strong as death, and cruel as the grave' (Song 8:6,7).","And it is then good, when it flows from faith, and pitcheth itself upon God in Christ as the object, and when it extendeth itself to all that is good, whether it be the good Word, the good work of grace, or the good men that have it, and also to their good lives.","But all soul-love floweth not from this principle, neither hath these for its object.","How many are there that make the object of their love the most vile of men, the most base of things, because it flows from vile affections, and from the lusts of the flesh?","God and Christ, good laws and good men, and their holy lives, they cannot abide, because their love wanteth a principle that should sanctify it in its first motion, and that should steer it to a goodly object.",But that is the first.,Of hatred.,2.,"There is hatred, which I count another passion of the soul; and this, as the other, is good or evil, as the principle from whence it flows and the object of it are.","'Ye that love the Lord, hate evil' (Psa 97:10).","Then, therefore, is this passion good, when it singleth out from the many thousand of things that are in the world that one filthy thing called sin; and when it setteth itself, the soul, and the whole man, against it, and engageth all the powers of the soul to seek and invent its ruin.7 But, alas, where shall this hatred be found?","What man is there whose soul is filled with this passion, thus sanctified by the love of God, and that makes sin, which is God's enemy, the only object of its indignation?","How many be there, I say, whose hatred is turned another way, because of the malignity of their minds.",They hate knowledge (Prov 1:22).,They hate God (Deu 7:10; Job 21:14).,They hate the righteous (2 Chron 29:2; Psa 34:21; Prov 29:10).,They hate God's ways (Mal 3:14; Prov 8:12).,"And all is, because the grace of filial fear is not the root and principle from whence their hatred flows.","'For the fear of the Lord is to hate evil:' wherefore, where this grace is wanting for a root in the soul, there it must of necessity swerve in the letting out of this passion; because the soul, where grace in wanting, is not at liberty to act simply, but is biased by the power of sin; that, while grace is absent, is present in the soul.","And hence it is that this passion, which, when acted well, is a virtue, is so abused, and made to exercise its force against that for which God never ordained it, nor gave it license to act.",Of joy.,3.,"Another passion of the soul is joy; and when the soul rejoiceth virtuously, it rejoiceth not in iniquity, 'but rejoiceth in the truth' (1 Cor 13:6).","This joy is a very strong passion, and will carry a man through a world of difficulties; it is a passion that beareth up, that supporteth and strengtheneth a man, let the object of his joy be what it will.","It is this that maketh the soul fat in goodness, if it have its object accordingly; and that which makes the soul bold in wickedness, if it indeed doth rejoice in iniquity.",Of fear.,4.,"Another passion of the soul is fear, natural fear; for so you must understand me of all the passions of the soul, as they are considered simply and in their own nature.","And, as it is with the other passions, so it is with this; it is made good or evil in its acts, as its principle and objects are; when this passion of the soul is good, then it springs from sense of the greatness, and goodness and majesty of God; also God himself is the object of this fear'--I will forewarn you,' says Christ, 'whom ye shall fear.","Fear him that can destroy both body and soul in hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him' (Matt 5:28; Luke 7:5).","But in all men this passion is not regulated and governed by these principles and objects, but is abused and turned, through the policy of Satan, quite into another channel.","It is made to fear men (Num 14:9), to fear idols (2 Kings 17:7,38), to fear devils and witches, yea, it is made to fear all the foolish, ridiculous, and apish fables that every old woman or atheistical fortune teller has the face to drop before the soul.",But fear is another passion of the soul.,Of grief.,5.,"Another passion of the soul is grief, and it, as those afore-named, acteth even according as it is governed.","When holiness is lovely and beautiful to the soul, and when the name of Christ is more precious than life, then will the soul sit down and be afflicted, because men keep not God's law.","'I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not Thy word' (Psa 119:158).","So Christ; He looked round about with anger, 'being grieved for the hardness of their hearts' (Mark 3:5).",But it is rarely seen that this passion of the soul is thus exercised.,Almost everybody has other things for the spending of the heat of this passion upon.,"Men are grieved that they thrive no more in the world; grieved that they have no more carnal, sensual, and worldly honour; grieved that they are suffered no more to range in the lusts and vanities of this life; but all this is because the soul is unaquainted with God, sees no beauty in holiness, but is sensual, and wrapt up in clouds and thick darkness.",Of anger.,6.,"And lastly, There is anger, which is another passion of the soul; and that, as the rest, is extended by the soul, according to the nature of the principle by which it is acted, and from whence it flows.","And, in a word, to speak nothing of the fierceness and power of this passion, it is then cursed when it breaketh out beyond the bounds that God hath set it, the which to be sure it doth, when it shall by its fierceness or irregular motion, run the soul into sin.","'Be ye angry, and sin not' (Eph 4:26), is the limitation wherewith God hath bounded this passion; and whatever is more than this, is a giving place to the devil.","And one reason, among others, why the Lord doth so strictly set this bound, and these limits to anger, is, for that it is so furious a passion, and for that it will so quickly swell up the soul with sin, as they say a toad swells with its poison.","Yea, it will in a moment so transport the spirit of a man, that he shall quickly forget himself, his God, his friend, and all good rule.","But my business is not now to make a comment upon the passions of the soul, only to show you that there are such, and also which they are.","And now, from this description of the soul, what follows but to put you in mind what a noble, powerful, lively, sensible thing the soul is, that by the text is supposed may be lost, through the heedlessness, or carelessness, or slavish fear of him whose soul it is; and also to stir you up to that care of, and labour after, the salvation of your soul, as becomes the weight of the matter.","If the soul were a trivial thing, or if a man, though he lost it, might yet himself be happy, it were another matter; but the loss of the soul is no small loss, nor can that man that has lost his soul, had he all the world, yea, the whole kingdom of heaven, in his own power be but in a most fearful and miserable condition.",But of these things more in their place.,[THE GREATNESS OF THE SOUL.],"SECOND, Having thus given you a description of the soul, what it is, I shall, in the next place, show you the greatness of it.","[Of the greatness of the soul, when compared with the body.]","First, And the first thing that I shall take occasion to make this manifest by, will be by showing you the disproportion that is betwixt that and the body; and I shall do it in these following particulars:-- The body a house for the soul.",1.,"The body is called the house of the soul, a house for the soul to dwell in.","Now everybody knows that the house is much inferior to him that, by God's ordinance, is appointed to dwell therein; that it is called the house of the soul, you find in Paul to the Corinthians: 'For we know,' saith he, 'that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens' (2 Cor 5:1).","We have then, a house for our soul in this world, and this house is the body, for the apostle can mean nothing else; therefore he calls it an earthly house.",'If our earthly house'--our house.,"But who doth he personate if he says, This is a house for the soul; for the body is part of him that says, Our house?","In this manner of language, he personates his soul with the souls of the rest that are saved; and thus to do, is common with the apostles, as will be easily discerned by them that give attendance to reading.","Our earthly houses; or, as Job saith, 'houses of clay,' for our bodies are bodies of clay: 'Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay' (Job 4:19; 13:12).","Indeed, he after maketh mention of a house in heaven, but that is not it about which he now speaks; now he speaks of this earthly house which we have (we, our souls) to dwell in, while on this side glory, where the other house stands, as ready prepared for us when we shall flit from this to that; or in case this should sooner or later be dissolved.","But that is the first; the body is compared to the house, but the soul to him that inhabiteth the house; therefore, as the man is more noble than the house he dwells in, so is the soul more noble than the body.","And yet, alas!","with grief be it spoken, how common is it for men to spend all their care, all their time, all their strength, all their wit and parts for the body and its honour and preferment, even as if the soul were some poor, pitiful, sorry, inconsiderable, and under thing, not worth the thinking of, or not worth the caring for.","But, The body clothing for the soul.",2.,The body is called the clothing and the soul that which is clothed therewith.,"Now, everybody knows that 'the body is more than raiment,' even carnal sense will teach us this.","But read that pregnant place: 'For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened (that is, with mortal flesh); not for that we should be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life' (2 Cor 5:4).",Thus the greatness of the soul appears in the preference that it hath to the body--the body is its raiment.,"We see that, above all creatures, man, because he is the most noble among all visible ones, has, for the adorning of his body, that more abundant comeliness.","'Tis the body of man, not of beast, that is clothed with the richest ornaments.","But now what a thing is the soul, that the body itself must be its clothing!","No suit of apparel is by God thought good enough for the soul, but that which is made by God himself, and that is that curious thing, the body.",But oh!,"how little is this considered--namely, the greatness of the soul.","'Tis the body, the clothes, the suit of apparel, that our foolish fancies are taken with, not at all considering the richness and excellency of that great and more noble part, the soul, for which the body is made a mantle to wrap it up in, a garment to clothe it withal.","If a man gets a rent in his clothes, it is little in comparison of a rent in his flesh; yea, he comforts himself when he looks on that rent, saying, Thanks be to God, it is not a rent in my flesh.",But ah!,"on the contrary, how many are there in the world that are more troubled for that they have a rent, a wound, or a disease in the body, than for that they have for the souls that will be lost and cast away.","A little rent in the body dejecteth and casteth such down, but they are not at all concerned, though their soul is now, and will yet further be, torn in pieces, 'Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver' (Psa 50:22).","But this is the second thing whereby, or by which, the greatness of the soul appears--to wit, in that the body, that excellent piece of God's workmanship, is but a garment, or clothing for the soul.",The body a vessel for the soul.,3.,"The body is called a vessel, or a case, for the soul to be put and kept in.",'That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctifcation and honour' (1 Thess 4:4).,"The apostle here doth exhort the people to abstain from fornication, which, in another place, he saith, '...is a sin against the body' (1 Cor 6:18).","And here again he saith, 'This is the will of God, that ye should abstain from fornication:' that the body be not defiled, 'that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour.'","His vessel, his earthen vessel, as he calls it in another place--for 'we have this treasure in earthen vessels.'","Thus, then, the body is called a vessel; yea, every man's body is his vessel.","But what has God prepared this vessel for, and what has He put into it?","Why, many things this body is to be a vessel for, but at present God has put into it that curious thing, the soul.","Cabinets, that are very rich and costly things of themselves, are not made nor designed to be vessels to be stuffed or filled with trumpery, and things of no value; no, these are prepared for rings and jewels, for pearls, for rubies, and things that are choice.","And if so, what shall we then think of the soul for which is prepared, and that of God, the most rich and excellent vessel in the world?","Surely it must be a thing of worth, yea, of more worth than is the whole world besides.",But alas!,who believes this talk?,"Do not even the most of men so set their minds upon, and so admire, the glory of this case or vessel, that they forget once with seriousness to think, and, therefore, must of necessity be a great way off, of those suitable esteems that becomes them to have of their souls.","But oh, since this vessel, this cabinet, this body, is so curiously made, and that to receive and contain, what thing is that for which God has made this vessel, and what is that soul that He hath put into it?","Wherefore thus, in the third place, is the greatness of the soul made manifest, even by the excellency of the vessel, the body, that God has made to put it in.",The body a tabernacle of the soul.,4.,The body is called a tabernacle for the soul.,"'Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle' (2 Pet 1:14), that is, my body, 'by death' (John 21:18,19).","'For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God,' etc.",(2 Cor 5:1).,"In both these places, by 'tabernacle,' can be meant nothing but the body; wherefore both the apostles, in these sentences do personate their souls, and speak as if the soul was THE ALL of a man; yea, they plainly tell us, that the body is but the house, clothes, vessel, and tabernacle for the soul.",But what a famous thing therefore is the soul!,"The tabernacle of old was a place erected for worship, but the worshippers were more excellent than the place; so our body is a tabernacle for the soul to worship God in, but must needs be accounted much inferior to the soul, forasmuch as the worshippers are always of more honour than the place they worship in; as he that dwelleth in the tabernacle hath more honour than the tabernacle.8 'I serve,' says Paul, God and Christ Jesus 'with my spirit (or soul) in the gospel' (Rom 1:9), but not with his spirit out of, but in, this tabernacle.","The tabernacle had instruments of worship for the worshippers; so has the body for the soul, and we are bid to 'yield our members as instruments of righteousness to God' (Rom 6:13).","The hands, feet, ears, eyes, and tongue, which last is our glory when used right, are all of them instruments of this tabernacle, and to be made use of by the soul, the inhabiter of this tabernacle, for the soul's performance of the service of God.","I thus discourse, to show you the greatness of the soul.","And, in mine opinion, there is something, if not very much, in what I say.","For all men admire the body, both for its manner of building, and the curious way of its being compacted together.","Yes, the further men, wise men, do pry into the wonderful work of God that is put forth in framing the body, the more still they are made to admire; and yet, as I said, this body is but a house, a mantle, a vessel, a tabernacle for the soul.","What, then, is the soul itself?9 But thus much for the first particular.",[Other things that show the greatness of the soul.],"Second, We will now come to other things that show us the greatness of the soul.","And, The soul is called God's breath.",1.,It is called God's breath of life.,"'And the Lord God formed man,' that is, the body, 'of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul' (Gen 2:7).","Do but compare these two together, the body and the soul; the body is made of dust, the soul is the breath of God.","Now, if God hath made this body so famous, as indeed He has, and yet it is made but of the dust of the ground, and we all do know what inferior matter it is, what is the soul, since the body is not only its house and garment, but since itself is made of the breath of God?","But, further, it is not only said that the soul is of the breath of the Lord, but that the Lord breathed into him the breath of life--to wit, a living spirit, for so the next words infer--and 'man became a living soul.'","Man, that is, the more excellent part of him, which, for that which is principal, is called man, that bearing the denomination of the whole; or man, the spirit and natural power, by which, as a reasonable creature, the whole of him is acted, 'became a living soul.'","But I stand not here upon definition, but upon demonstration.","The body, that noble part of man, had its original from the dust; for so says the Word, 'Dust thou art (as to thy body), and unto dust shalt thou return' (Gen 3:19).","But as to thy more noble part, thou art from the breath of God, God putting forth in that a mighty work of creating power, and man 'was made a living soul' (1 Cor 15:45).",Mark my reason.,"There is as great a disparity betwixt the body and the soul, as is between the dust of the ground and that, here called, the breath of life of the Lord.","And note further, that, as the dust of the ground did not lose, but gained glory by being formed into the body of a man, so this breath of the Lord lost nothing neither by being made a living soul.",O man!,dost thou know what thou art?,The soul God's image.,2.,"As the soul is said to be of the breath of God, so it is said to be made after God's own image, even after the similitude of God.","'And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness.--So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him' (Gen 1:26,27).","Mark, in His own image, in the image of God created He him; or, as James hath it, it is 'made after the similitude of God,' (James 3:9); like Him, having in it that which beareth semblance with Him.","I do not read of anything in heaven, or earth, or under the earth, that is said to be made after this manner, or that is at all so termed, save only the Son of God Himself.","The angels are noble creatures, and for present employ are made a little higher than man himself, (Heb 2); but that any of them are said to be made 'after God's image,' after His own image, even after the similitude of God, that I find not.","This character the Holy Ghost, in the Scriptures of truth, giveth only of man, of the soul of man; for it must not be thought that the body is here intended in whole or in part.","For though it be said that Christ was made after the similitude of sinful flesh (Phil 2), yet it is not said that sinful flesh is made after the similitude of God; but I will not dispute; I only bring these things to show how great a thing, how noble a thing the soul is; in that, at its creation, God thought it worthy to be made, not like the earth, or the heavens, or the angels, seraphims, or archangels, but like Himself, His own self, saying, 'Let Us make man in Our own likeness.",So He made man in His own image.',"This, I say, is a character above all angels; for, as the apostle said, 'To which of the angels said He at anytime, 'Thou art my Son?'","So, of which of them hath He at any time said, This is, or shall be, made in or after Mine image, Mine own image?","O what a thing is the soul of man, that above all the creatures in heaven or earth, being made in the image and similitude of God.10 The soul God's desire.",3.,"Another thing by which the greatness of the soul is made manifest is this, it is that--and that only, and to say this is more than to say, it is that above all the creatures--that the great God desires communion with.","He 'hath set apart him that is godly for himself,' (Psa 4:3); that is, for communion with his soul; therefore the spouse saith concerning him, 'His desire is toward me,' (Song 7:10); and, therefore, he saith again, 'I will dwell in them, and walk in them' (2 Cor 6:16).","To 'dwell in,' and 'walk in,' are terms that intimate communion and fellowship; as John saith, 'Our fellowship, truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ' (1 John 1:3).","That is, our soul-fellowship; for it must not be understood of the body, though I believe that the body is much influenced when the soul has communion with God; but it is the soul, and that only, that at present is capable of having and maintaining of this blessed communion.","But, I say, what a thing is this, that God, the great God, should choose to have fellowship and communion with the soul above all.","We read, indeed, of the greatness of the angels, and how near also they are unto God; but yet there are not such terms that bespeak such familiar acts between God and angels, as to demonstrate that they have such communion with God as has, or as the souls of His people may have.","Where has He called them His love, His dove, His fair one?","and where, when He speaketh of them, doth He express a communion that they have with Him by the similitude of conjugal love?",I speak of what is revealed; the secret things belong to the Lord our God.,Now by all this is manifest the greatness of the soul.,"Men of greatness and honour, if they have respect to their own glory, will not choose for their familiars the base and rascally crew of this world; but will single out for their fellows, fellowship, and communion, those that are most like themselves.","True, the King has not an equal, yet He is for being familiar only with the nobles of the land: so God, with Him none can compare; yet since the soul is by Him singled out for His walking mate and companion, it is a sign it is the highest born, and that upon which the blessed Majesty looks, as upon that which is most meet to be singled out for communion with Himself.","Should we see a man familiar with the King, we would, even of ourselves, conclude he is one of the nobles of the land; but this is not the lot of every soul--some have fellowship with devils, yet not because they have a more base original than those that lie in God's bosom, but they, through sin, are degenerate, and have chosen to be great with His enemy--but all these things show the greatness of the soul.",The soul a vessel for grace.,4.,"The soul of men are such as God counts worthy to be the vessels to hold His grace, the graces of the Spirit, in.","The graces of the Spirit--what like them, or where here are they to be found, save in the souls of men only?","'Of His fulness have all we received, and grace for grace' (John 1:16).","Received, into what?","into 'the hidden part,' as David calls it (Psa 51:6).","Hence the king's daughter is said to be 'all glorious within,' (Psa 45:15); because adorned and beautified with the graces of the Spirit.","For that which David calls the hidden part is the inmost part of the soul; and it is, therefore, called the hidden part, because the soul is invisible, nor can any one living infallibly know what is in the soul but God Himself.","But, I say, the soul is the vessel into which this golden oil is poured, and that which holds, and is accounted worthy to exercise and improve the same.",Therefore the soul is it which is said to love God--'Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?',"(Song 3:3); and, therefore, the soul is that which exerciseth the spirit of prayer--'With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early' (Isa 26:9).",With the soul also men are said to believe and into the soul God is said to put His fear.,"This is the vessel into which the virgins got oil, and out of which their lamps were supplied by the same.","But what a thing, what a great thing therefore is the soul, that that above all things that God hath created should be the chosen vessel to put His grace in.","The body is the vessel for the soul, and the soul is the vessel for the grace of God.","But, 5.","The greatness of the soul is manifest by the greatness of the price that Christ paid for it, to make it an heir of glory; and that was His precious blood (1 Cor 6:20; 1 Peter 1:18,19).","We do use to esteem of things according to the price that is given for them, especially when we are convinced that the purchase has not been made by the estimation of a fool.","Now the soul is purchased by a price that the Son, the wisdom of God, thought fit to pay for the redemption thereof--what a thing, then, is the soul?","Judge of the soul by the price that is paid for it, and you must needs confess, unless you count the blood that hath bought it an unholy thing, that it cannot but be of great worth and value.","Suppose a prince, or some great man, should, on a sudden, descend from his throne, or chair of state, to take up, that he might put in his bosom, something that he had espied lying trampled under the feet of those that stand by; would you think that he would do this for an old horse shoe,11 or for so trivial a thing as a pin or a point?","12 Nay, would you not even of yourselves conclude that that thing for which the prince, so great a man, should make such a stoop, must needs be a thing of very great worth?","Why, this is the case of Christ and the soul.","Christ is the prince, His throne was in heaven, and, as He sat there, He espied the souls of sinners trampled under the foot of the law and death for sin.","Now, what doth He, but comes down from His throne, stoops down to the earth, and there, since He could not have the trodden-down souls without price, He lays down His life and blood for them (2 Cor 8:9).",But would He have done this for inconsiderable things?,"No, nor for the souls of sinners neither, had He not valued them higher than he valued heaven and earth besides.","13 This, therefore, is another thing by which the greatness of the soul is known.",The soul immortal.,6.,"The soul is immortal, it will have a sensible being for ever, none can kill the soul (Luke 12:4; Matt 10:28).","If all the angels in heaven, and all the men on earth, should lay all their strength together, they cannot kill or annihilate one soul.","No, I will speak without fear, if it may be said, God cannot do what He will not do; then He cannot annihilate the soul: but, notwithstanding all His wrath, and the vengeance that He will inflict on sinful souls, they yet shall abide with sensible beings, yet to endure, yet to bear punishment.","If anything could kill the soul, it would be death; but death cannot do it, neither first nor second; the first cannot, for when Dives was slain, as to his body by death, his soul was found alive in hell--'He lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment' (Luke 16:23).","The second death cannot do it, because it is said their worm never dies, but is always torturing them with his gnawing (Mark 9:44).","But that could not be, if time, or lying in hell fire for ever, could annihilate the soul.","Now, this also shows the greatness of the soul, that it is that which has an endless life, and that will, therefore, have a being endlessly.",O what a thing is the soul!,"The soul, then, is immortal, though not eternal.","That is eternal that has neither beginning nor end, and, therefore, eternal is properly applicable to none but God; hence He is called the 'eternal God' (Deu 33:27).","Immortal is that which, though it hath a beginning, yet hath no end, it cannot die, nor cease to be; and this is the state of the soul.","It cannot cease to have a being when it is once created; I mean, a living, sensible being.","For I mean by living, only such a being as distinguishes it from annihilation or incapableness of sense and feeling.","Hence, as the rich man is after death said to 'lift up his eyes in hell,' so the beggar is said, when he died, to be 'carried by the angels, into Abraham's bosom' (Luke 16:22,23).","And both these sayings must have respect to the souls of these men; for, as for their bodies, we know at present it is otherwise with them.","The grave is their house, and so must be till the trumpet shall sound, and the heavens pass away like a scroll.","Now, I say, the immortality of the soul shows the greatness of it, as the eternity of God shows the greatness of God.","It cannot be said of any angel but that he is immortal, and so it is, and ought to be said of the soul.","This, therefore, shows the greatness of the soul, in that it is as to abiding so like unto him.",'Tis the soul that acts the body.,7.,"But a word or two more, and so to conclude this head.","The soul!--why, it is the soul that acteth the body in all these things, good or bad, that seem good and reasonable, or amazingly wicked.","True, the acts and motions of the soul are only seen and heard in, and by the members and motions of the body, but the body is but a poor instrument, soul is the great agitator and actor.",'The body without the spirit is dead' (James 2:26).,"All those famous arts, and works, and inventions of works, that are done by men under heaven, they are all the intentions of the soul, and the body, as acting and labouring therein, doth it but as a tool that the soul maketh use of to bring his invention into maturity (Eccl 7:29).","How many things have men found out to the amazing of one another, to the wonderment of one another, to the begetting of endless commendations of one another in the world, while, in the meantime, the soul, which indeed is the true inventor of all, is overlooked, not regarded, but dragged up and down by every lust, and prostrate, and made a slave to every silly and beastly thing.","O the amazing darkness that hath covered the face of the hearts of the children of men, that they cannot deliver their soul, nor say, 'Is there not a lie in my right hand?'","(Isa 44:20), though they are so cunning in all other matters.","Take man in matters that are abroad, and far from home, and he is the mirror of all the world; but take him at home, and put him upon things that are near him, I mean, that have respect to the things that concern his soul, and then you will find him the greatest fool that ever God made.","But this must not be applied to the soul simply as it is God's creature, but to the soul sinful, as it has willingly apostatized from God, and so suffered itself to be darkened, and that with such thick and stupifying darkness, that it is bound up and cannot--it hath a napkin of sin bound so close before its eyes that it is not able--of itself--to look to, and after those things which should be its chiefest concern, and without which it will be most miserable for ever.",The soul capable of having to do with invisibles.,8.,"Further, as the soul is thus curious about arts and sciences, and about every excellent thing of this life, so it is capable of having to do with invisibles, with angels, good or bad, yea, with the highest and Supreme Being, even with the holy God of heaven.","I told you before that God sought the soul of man to have it for His companion; and now I tell you that the soul is capable of communion with Him, when the darkness that sin hath spread over its face is removed.","The soul is an intelligent power, it can be made to know and understand depths, and heights, and lengths, and breadths, in those high, sublime, and spiritual mysteries that only God can reveal and teach; yea, it is capable of diving unutterably into them.","And herein is God, the God of glory, much delighted and pleased--to wit, that He hath made Himself a creature that is capable of hearing, of knowing, and of understanding of His mind, when opened and revealed to it.","I think I may say, without offence to God or man, that one reason why God made the world was, that He might manifest Himself, not only by, but to the works which He made; but, I speak with reverence, how could that be, if He did not also make some of His creatures capable of apprehending of Him in those most high mysteries and methods in which He purposed to reveal Himself?","But then, what are those creatures which He hath made (unto whom when these things are shown) that are able to take them in and understand them, and so to improve them to God's glory, as He hath ordained and purposed they should, but souls?",for none else in the visible world are capable of doing this but they.,"And hence it is that to them, and them only, He beginneth to reveal Himself in this world.","And hence it is that they, and they only, are gathered up to Him where He is, for they are they that are called 'the spirits of just men made perfect,' (Heb 12:23); the spirit of a beast goeth downward to the earth, it is the spirit of a man that goes upwards to God that gave it (Eccl 3:21;12:7).","For that, and that only, is capable of beholding and understanding the glorious visions of heaven; as Christ said, 'Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am; that they may behold My glory, which thou hast given Me; for thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the world' (John 17:24).",And thus the greatness of the soul is manifest.,"True, the body is also gathered up into glory, but not simply for its own sake, or because that is capable of itself to know and understand the glories of its Maker; but that has been a companion with the soul in this world, has also been its house, its mantle, its cabinet and tabernacle here; it has also been it by which the soul hath acted, in which it hath wrought, and by which its excellent appearances have been manifested; and it shall also there be its co-partner and sharer in its glory.","Wherefore, as the body here did partake of soul excellencies, and was also conformed to its spiritual and regenerate principles; so it shall be hereafter a partaker of that glory with which the soul shall be filled, and also be made suitable by that glory to become a partaker and co-partner with it of the eternal excellencies which heaven will put upon it.","In this world it is a gracious soul (I speak now of the regenerate), and in that world it shall be a glorious one.","In this world the body was conformable to the soul as it was gracious, and in that world it shall be conformable to it as it is glorious; conformable, I say, by partaking of that glory that then the soul shall partake of; yea, it shall also have an additional glory to adorn, and make it yet the more capable of being serviceable to it, and with it in its great acts before God in eternal glory.","Oh, what great things are the souls of the sons of men!",The soul capable of diving into the depths and mysteries of hell.,9.,"But again, as the soul is thus capable of enjoying God in glory, and of prying into these mysteries that are in him, so it is capable, with great profundity, to dive into the mysterious depths of hell.","Hell is a place and state utterly unknown to any in this visible world, excepting the souls of men; nor shall any for ever be capable of understanding the miseries thereof, save souls and fallen angels.","Now, I think, as the joys of heaven stand not only in speculation, or in beholding of glory, but in a sensible enjoyment and unspeakable pleasure which those glories will yield to the soul (Psa 16:11), so the torments of hell will not stand in the present lashes and strokes which by the flames of eternal fire God will scourge the ungodly with; but the torments of hell stand much, if not in the greatest part of them, in those deep thoughts and apprehensions, which souls in the next world will have of the nature and occasions of sin; of God, and of separation from Him; of the eternity of those miseries, and of the utter impossibility of their help, ease, or deliverance for ever.",O!,"damned souls will have thoughts that will clash with glory, clash with justice, clash with law, clash with itself, clash with hell, and with the everlastingness of misery; but the point, the edge, and the poison of all these thoughts will still be galling, and dropping, and spewing out their stings into the sore, grieved, wounded, and fretted place, which is the conscience, though not the conscience only; for I may say of the souls in hell, that they all over are but one wound, one sore!",Miseries as well as mercies sharpen and make quick the apprehensions of the soul.,"Behold Spira in his book, 14 Cain in his guilt, and Saul with the witch of Endor, and you shall see men ripened, men enlarged and greatened in their fancies, imaginations, and apprehensions though not about God, and heaven, and glory, yet about their loss, their misery, and their woe, and their hells (Isa 33:14; Psa 1:4; Rev 14:10; Mark 9:44,46).",The ability of the soul to bear.,10.,"Nor doth their ability to bear, if it be proper to say they bear those dolors which there for ever they shall endure, a little demonstrate their greatness.","Everlasting burning, devouring fire, perpetual pains, gnawing worms, utter darkness, and the ireful souls, face, and strokes of Divine and infinite justice will not, cannot, make this soul extinct, as I said before.","I think it is not so proper to say the soul that is damned for sin doth bear these things, as to say it doth ever sink under them: and, therefore, their place of torment is called the bottomless pit, because they are ever sinking, and shall never come there where they will find any stay.","Yet they live under wrath, but yet only so as to be sensible of it, as to smart and be in perpetual anguish, by reason of the intolerableness of their burden.","But doth not their thus living, abiding, and retaining a being(or what you will call it), demonstrate the greatness and might of the soul?",Alas!,"heaven and earth are short of this greatness, for these, though under less judgment by far, do fade and wax old like a moth-eaten garment, and, in their time, will vanish away to nothing (Heb 1).","Also, we see how quickly the body, when the soul is under a fear of the rebukes of justice, how soon, I say, it wastes, moulders away, and crumbleth into the grave; but the soul is yet strong, and abides sensible to be dealt withal for sin by everlasting burnings.",The might of the soul further shown.,11.,"The soul, by God's ordinance, while this world lasts, has a time appointed it to forsake and leave the body to be turned again to the dust as it was, and this separation is made by death, (Heb 9:27); therefore the body must cease for a time to have sense, or life, or motion; and a little thing brings it now into this state; but in the next world, the wicked shall partake of none of this; for the body and the soul being at the resurrection rejoined, this death, that once did rend them asunder, is for ever overcome and extinct; so that these two which lived in sin must for ever be yoked together in hell.","Now, there the soul being joined to the body, and death, which before did separate them, being utterly taken away, the soul retains not only its own being, but also continueth the body to be, and to suffer sensibly the pains of hell, without those decays that it used to sustain.","And the reason why this death shall then be taken away is, because justice in its bestowing its rewards for transgressions may not be interrupted, but that body and soul, as they lived and acted in sin together, might be destroyed for sin in hell together (Matt 10:28 Luke 12:5).","Destroyed, I say, but with such a destruction, which, though it is everlasting, will not put a period to their sensible suffering the vengeance of eternal fire (2 Thess 1:8,9).","This death, therefore, though that also be the wages of sin, would now, were it suffered to continue, be a hinderance to the making known of the wrath of God, and also of the created power and might of the soul.",(1.),"It would hinder the making known of the wrath of God, for it would take the body out of the way, and make it incapable of sensible suffering for sin, and so removing one of the objects of vengeance the power of God's wrath would be so far undiscovered.",(2.),"It would also hinder the manifestation of the power and might of the soul, which is discovered much by its abiding to retain its own being while the wrath of God is grappling with it, and more by its continuing to the body a sensible being with itself.","Death, therefore, must now be removed, that the soul may be made the object of wrath without molestation or interruption.","That the soul, did I say?","yea, that soul and body both might be so.","Death would now be a favour, though once the fruit of sin, and also the wages thereof, might it now be suffered to continue, because it would ease the soul of some of its burden: for a tormented body cannot but be a burden to a spirit, and so the wise man insinuates when he says, 'The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;' that is, bear up under it, but yet so as that it feels it a burden.","We see that, because of the sympathy that is between body and soul, how one is burdened if the other be grieved.","A sick body is a burden to the soul, and a wounded spirit is a burden to the body; 'a wounded spirit who can bear?'",(Prov 18:14).,"But death must not remove this burden, but the soul must have the body for a burden, and the body must have the soul for a burden, and both must have the wrath of God for a burden.","Oh, therefore, here will be burden upon burden, and all upon the soul, for the soul will be the chief seat of this burden!",But thus much to show you the greatness of the soul.,[OF THE LOSS OF THE SOUL.],"THIRD, I shall now come to the third thing which was propounded to be spoken to; and that is, to show you what we are to understand by losing of the soul, or what the loss of the soul is--'What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'",[He that loseth his soul loseth himself.],"First, The loss of the soul is a loss, in the nature of it, peculiar to itself.","There is no such loss, as to the nature of loss, as is the loss of the soul; for that he that hath lost his soul has lost himself.","In all other losses, it is possible for a man to save himself, but he that loseth his soul, loseth himself--'For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself?'",(Luke 9:25).,"Wherefore, the loss of the soul is a loss that cannot be paralleled.","He that loseth himself, loseth his all, his lasting all; for himself is his all--his all in the most comprehensive sense.","What mattereth it what a man gets, if by the getting thereof he loseth himself?","Suppose a man goeth to the Indies for gold, and he loadeth his ship therewith; but at his return, that sea that carried him thither swallows him up--now, what has he got?","But this is but a lean similitude with reference to the matter in hand--to wit, to set forth the loss of the soul.","Suppose a man that has been at the Indies for gold should, at his return, himself be taken by them of Algiers, and there made a slave of, and there be hunger-bit, and beaten till his bones are broken, 15 what has he got?",what is he advantaged by his rich adventure?,"Perhaps, you will say, he has got gold enough to obtain his ransom.","Indeed this may be; and therefore no similitude can be found that can fully amplify the matter, 'for what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'","'Tis a loss that standeth by itself, there is not another like it, or unto which it may be compared.","'Tis only like itself--'tis singular, 'tis the chief of all losses--the highest, the greatest loss.",'For what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?',"A man may lose his wife, his children, his estate, his liberty, and his life, and have all made up again, and have all restored with advantage, and may, therefore, notwithstanding all these losses, be far enough off from losing of himself.",(Luke 14:26; Mark 8:35).,"For he may lose his life, and save it; yea, sometimes the only way to save that, is to lose it; but when a man has lost himself, his soul, then all is gone to all intents and purposes.","There is no word says, 'he that loses his soul shall save it;' but contrariwise, the text supposeth that a man has lost his soul, and then demands if any can answer it--'What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'","All, then, that he gains that loseth his soul is only this, he has gained a loss, he has purchased the loss of losses, he has nothing left him now but his loss, but the loss of himself, of his whole self.","He that loseth his life for Christ, shall save it; but he that loseth himself for sin, and for the world, shall lose himself to perfection of loss; he has lost himself, and there is the full point.","There are several things fall under this first head, upon which I would touch a little.",He that has lost himself will never be more at his own dispose.,(1.),He that has lost his soul has lost himself.,"Now, he that lost himself is no more at his own dispose.","While a man enjoys himself, he is at his own dispose.","A single man, a free man, a rich man, a poor man, any man that enjoys himself, is at his own dispose.",I speak after the manner of men.,But he that has lost himself is not at his own dispose.,"He is, as I may say, now out of his own hands: he has lost himself, his soul-self, his own self, his whole self, by sin, and wrath and hell hath found him; he is, therefore, now no more at his own dispose, but at the dispose of justice, of wrath, and hell; he is committed to prison, to hell prison, there to abide, not at pleasure, not as long and as little time as he will, but the term appointed by his judge: nor may he there choose his own affliction, neither for manner, measure, or continuance.","It is God that will spread the fire and brimstone under him, it is God that will pile up wrath upon him, and it is God himself that will blow the fire.","And 'the breathof the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it' (Isa 30:33).","And thus it is manifest that he that has lost himself, his soul, is no more at his own dispose, but at the dispose of them that find him.","He that hath lost himself, is not at liberty to dispose of what he hath.",(2.),"Again, as he that has lost himself is not at his own dispose, so neither is he at liberty to dispose of what he has; for the man that has lost himself has something yet of his own.","The text implies that his soul is his when lost, yea, when that and his all, himself is lost; but as he cannot dispose of himself, so he cannot dispose of what he hath.",Let me take leave to make out my meaning.,"If he that is lost, that has lost himself, has not, notwithstanding, something that in some sense may be called his own, then he that is lost is nothing.","The man that is in hell has yet the powers, the senses, and passions of his soul; for not he nor his soul must be thought to be stripped of these; for then he would be lower than the brute; but yet all these, since he is there, are by God improved against himself; or, if you will, the point of this man's sword is turned against his own heart, and made to pierce his own liver.","The soul by being in hell loseth nothing of its aptness to think, its quickness to pierce, to pry, and to understand; nay, hell has ripened it in all these things; but, I say, the soul with its improvements as to these, or anything else, is not in the hand of him that hath lost himself to manage for his own advantage, but in the hand, and in the power, and to be disposed as is thought meet by him into whose revenging hand by sin he has delivered himself--to wit, in the hand of God.","So, then, God now has the victory, and disposeth of all the powers, senses, and passions of the soul for the chastising of him that has lost himself.","Now the understanding is only employed and improved in and about the apprehending of such things as will be like daggers at the heart--to wit, about justice, sin, hell, and eternity, to grieve and break the spirit of the damned; yea, to break, to wound, and to tear the soul in pieces.","The depths of sin which the man has loved, the good nature of God whom the man has hated, the blessings of eternity which the soul has despised, shall now be understood by him more than ever, but yet so only, as to increase grief and sorrow, by improving of the good and of the evil of the things understood, to the greater wounding of the spirit; wherefore now, every touch that the understanding shall give to the memory will be as a touch of a red-hot iron, or like a draught of scalding lead poured down the throat.",The memory also letteth those things down upon the conscience with no less terror and perplexity.,"And now the fancy or imagination doth start and stare like a man by fears bereft of wits, and doth exercise itself, or rather is exercised by the hand of revenging justice, so about the breadth and depth of present and future punishments, as to lay the soul as on a burning rack.","Now also the judgment, as with a mighty maul, driveth down the soul in the sense and pangs of everlasting misery into that pit that has no bottom; yea, it turneth again, and, as with a hammer, it riveteth every fearful thought and apprehension of the soul so fast that it can never be loosed again for ever and ever.",Alas!,"now the conscience can sleep, be dull, be misled, or batter, no longer; no, it must now cry out; understanding will make it, memory will make it, fancy or imagination will make it.","Now, I say, it will cry out of sin, of justice, and of the terribleness of the punishment that hath swallowed him up that has lost himself.","Here will be no forgetfulness; yet nothing shall be thought on but that which will wound and kill; here will be no time, cause, or means for diversion; all will stick and gnaw like a viper.","Now the memory will go out to where sin was heretofore committed, it will also go out to the word that did forbid it.","The understanding also, and the judgment too, will now consider of the pretended necessity that the man had to break the commandments of God, and of the seasonableness of the cautions and of the convictions which were given him to forbear, by all which more load will be laid upon him that has lost himself; for here all the powers, senses, and passions of the soul must be made self-burners, self-tormentors, self-executioners, by the just judgment of God; also all that the will shall do in this place shall be but to wish for ease, but the wish shall only be such as shall only seem to lift up, for the cable rope of despair shall with violence pull him down again.","The will indeed will wish for ease, and so will the mind, etc., but all these wishers will by wishing arrive to no more advantage but to make despair which is the most twinging stripe of hell, to cut yet deepeer into the whole soul of him that has lost himself; wherefore, after all that can be wished for, they return again to their burning chair, where they sit and bewail their misery.","Thus will all the powers, senses, and passions of the soul of him that has lost himself be out of his own power to dispose for his advantage, and will be only in the hand and under the management of the revenging justice of God.","And herein will that state of the damned be worse than it is now with the fallen angels; for though the fallen angels are now cast down to hell, in chains, and sure in themselves at last to partake of eternal judgment, yet at present they are not so bound up as the damned sinner shall be; for notwithstanding their chains, and their being the prisoners of the horrible hells, yet they have a kind of liberty granted them, and that liberty will last till the time appointed, to tempt, to plot, to contrive, and invent their mischiefs, against the Son of God and His (Job 1:7; 2:2).","And though Satan knows that this at last will work for his future condemnation, yet at present he finds it some diversion to his trembling mind, and obtains, through his so busily employing of himself against the gospel and its professors, something to sport and refresh himself withal; yea, and doth procure to himself some small crumbs of minutes of forgetfulness of his own present misery and of the judgment that is yet to pass upon him; but this privilege will then be denied to him that has lost himself; there will be no cause nor matter for diversion; there it will; as in the old world, rain day and night fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven upon them (Rev 14:10,11).","Misery is fixed; the worm will be always sucking at and gnawing of, their soul; also, as I have said afore, all the powers, senses, and passions of the soul will throw their darts inwards, yea, of God will be made to do it, to the utter, unspeakable, and endless torment of him that has lost himself.","Again, They cannot sit down by the loss.",(3.),"All therefore that he that has lost himself can do is, to sit down by the loss.","Do I say, he can do this?--oh!","if that could be, it would be to such, a mercy; I must therefore here correct myself--That they cannot do; for to sit down by the loss implies a patient enduring; but there will be no such grace as patience in hell with him that has lost himself; here, will also want a bottom for patience--to wit, the providence of God; for a providence of God, though never so dismal, is a bottom for patience to the afflicted; but men go not to hell by providence, but by sin.","Now sin being the cause, other effects are wrought; for they that go to hell, and that there miserably perish, shall never say it was God by His providence that brought them hither, and so shall not have that on which to lean and stay themselves.","They shall justify God, and lay the fault upon themselves concluding that it was sin with which their souls did voluntarily work--yea, which their souls did suck in as sweet milk--that is the cause of this their torment.","Now this will work after another manner, and will produce quite another thing than patience, or a patient enduring of their torment; for their seeing that they are not only lost, but have lost themselves, and that against the ordinary means that of God was provided to prevent that loss; yea, when they shall see what a base thing sin is, how that it is the very worst of things, and that which also makes all things bad, and that for the sake of that they have lost themselves, this will make them fret, and, gnash, and gnaw with anger themselves; this will set all the passions of the soul, save love, for that I think will be stark dead, all in a rage, all in a self-tormenting fire.","You know there is nothing that will sooner put a man into and manage his rage against himself than will a full conviction in his conscience that by his own only folly, and that against caution, and counsel, and reason to the contrary, he hath brought himself into extreme distress and misery.","But how much more will it make this fire burn when he shall see all this is come upon him for a toy, for a bauble, for a thing that is worse than nothing!","Why, this is the case with him that has lost himself; and therefore he cannot sit down by the loss, cannot be at quiet under the sense of his loss.","For sharply and wonderful piercingly, considering the loss of himself, and the cause thereof, which is sin, he falls to a tearing of himself in pieces with thoughts as hot as the coals of juniper, and to a gnashing upon himself for this; also the Divine wisdom and justice of God helpeth on this self-tormentor in his self-tormenting work, by holding the justice of the law against which he has offended, and the unreasonableness of such offence, continually before his face.","For if, to an enlightened man who is in the door of hope, the sight of all past evil practices will work in him 'vexation of spirit,' to see what fools we were, (Eccl 1:14); how can it but be to them that go to hell a vexation only to understand the report, the report that God did give them of sin, of His grace, of hell, and of everlasting damnation, and yet that they should be such fools to go thither?",(Isa 28:19).,"But to pursue this head no further, I will come now to the next thing.",[The loss of the soul a double loss.],"Secondly, As the loss of the soul is, in the nature of the loss, a loss peculiar to itself, so the loss of the soul is a double loss; it is, I say, a loss that is double, lost both by man and God; man has lost it, and by that loss has lost himself; God has lost it, and by that loss it is cast away.","And to make this a little plainer unto you, I suppose it will be readily granted that men do lose their souls.",But now how doth God lose it?,"The soul is God's as well as man's--man's because it is of themselves; God's because it is His creature; God has made us this soul, and hence it is that all souls are His (Jer 38:16; Eze 18:4).","Now the loss of the soul doth not only stand in the sin of man, but in the justice of God.","Hence He says, 'What is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away' (Luke 9:25).","Now this last clause, 'or be cast away,' is not spoken to show what he that has lost his soul has done, though a man may also be said to cast away himself; but to show what God will do to those that have lost themselves, what God will add to that loss.","God will not cast away a righteous man, but God will cast away the wicked, such a wicked one as by the text is under our consideration (Job 8:20; Matt 13:50).","This, then, is that which God will add, and so make the sad state of them that lose themselves double.","The man for sin has lost himself, and God by justice will cast him away; according to that of Abigail to David, 'The soul of my lord,' said she, 'shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall He sling out, as out of the middle of a sling' (1 Sam 25:29).","So that here is God's hand as well as man's; man's by sin, and God's by justice.","God shall cast them away; wherefore in the text above mentioned he doth not say, or cast away himself, as meaning the act of the man whose soul is lost; but, 'or be cast away' (Luke 9:25).","Supposing a second person joining with the man himself in the making up of the greatness of the loss of the soul--to wit, God himself, who will verily cast away that man who has lost himself.","God shall cast them away--that is, exclude them His favour or protection, and deliver them up to the due reward of their deed!","He shall shut them out of His heaven, and deliver them up to their hell; He shall deny them a share in his glory, and shall leave them to their own shame; He shall deny them a portion in His peace, and shall deliver them up to the torments of the devil, and of their own guilty consciences; He shall cast them out of His affection, pity, and compassion, and shall leave them to the flames that they by sin have kindled, and to the worm, or biting cockatrice, that they themselves have hatched, nursed, and nourished in their bosoms.","And this will make their loss double, and so a loss that is loss to the uttermost, a loss above every loss.","A man may cast away himself and not be cast away of God; a man may be cast away by others, and not be cast away of God; yea, what way soever a man be cast away, if he be not cast away for sin, he is safe, he is yet found, and in a sure hand.","But for a man so to lose himself as by that loss to provoke God to cast him away too, this is fearful.","The casting away, then, mentioned in Luke, is a casting away by the hand of God, by the revenging hand of God; and it supposeth two things--1.",God's abhorrence of such a soul.,2.,God's just repaying of it for its wickedness by way of retaliation.,1.,It supposeth God's abhorrence of the soul.,"That which we abhor, that we cast from us, and put out of our favour and respect with disdain, and a loathing thereof.","So when God teacheth Israel to loathe and abhor their idols, He bids them 'to cast away their very covering as a stinking and menstruous cloth, and to say unto it, 'Get you hence' (Isa 30:22), 'He shall gather the good into vessels, and cast the bad away' (Matt 13:48; 25:41).",Cast them out of My presence.,"Well, but whither must they go?","The answer is, Into hell, into utter darkness, into the fire that is prepared for the devil and his angels.","Wherefore, to be cast away, to be cast away of God, it showeth unto us God's abhorrence of such souls, and how vile and loathsome such are in His divine eyes.","And the similitude of Abigail's sling, mentioned before, doth yet further show us the greatness of this abhorrence--'The souls of thine enemies,' said she, 'God shall sling out as out of the middle of a sling.'","When a man casts a stone away with a sling, then he casteth it furthest from him, for with a sling he can cast a stone further than by his hand.","'And he,' saith the text, 'shall cast them away as with a sling.'","But that is not all, neither: for it is not only said that He shall sling away their souls, but that He shall sling them away as 'out of the middle of a sling.'","When a stone is placed, to be cast away, in the middle of a sling, then doth the slinger cast it furthest of all.","Now God is the slinger, abhorrence is His sling, the lost soul is the stone, and it is placed in the very middle of the sling, and is from thence cast away.","And, therefore, it is said again, that 'such shall go into utter, outer darkness'--that is, furthest off of all.",This therefore shows us how God abhors that man that for sin has lost himself.,And well he may; for such an one has not only polluted and defiled himself with sin; and that is the most offensive thing to God under heaven; but he has abused the handiwork of God.,"The soul, as I said before, is the workmans hip of God, yea, the top-piece that He hath made in all the visible world; also He made it for to be delighted with it, and to admit it into communion with Himself.","Now for man thus to abuse God; for a man to take his soul, which is God's, and prostrate it to sin, to the world, to the devil, and every beastly lust, flat against the command of God, and notwithstanding the soul was also His; this is horrible, and calls aloud upon that God whose soul this is to abhor, and to show, by all means possible, His abhorrence of such an one.",2.,"As this casting of them away supposeth God's abhorrence of them, so it supposeth God's just repaying of them for their wickedness by way of retaliation.","God all the time of the exercise of His long-suffering and forbearance towards them, did call upon them, wait upon them, send after them by His messengers, to turn them from their evil ways; but they despised at, they mocked, the messengers of the Lord.","Also they shut their eyes, and would not see; they stopped their ears, and would not understand; and did harden themselves against the beseeching of their God.","Yea, all that day long He did stretch out His hand towards them, but they chose to be a rebellious and gainsaying people; yea, they said unto God, 'Depart from us;' and 'what is the Almighty' that we should pray unto him?","(Hosea 6:2; Rev 16:21; Job 21:14,15; Mal 3:14).","And of all these things God takes notice, writes them down, and seals them up for the time to come, and will bring them out and spread them before them, saying, I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched out Mine hand, and no man regarded; I have exercised patience, and gentleness, and long-suffering towards you, and in all that time you despised Me, and cast Me behind your back; and now the time, and the exercise of My patience, when I waited upon you, and suffered your manners, and did bear your contempts and scorns, is at an end; wherefore I will now arise, and come forth to the judgment that I have appointed.","But, Lord, saith the sinner, we turn now.","But now; saith God, turning is out of season; the day of My patience is ended.","But, Lord, says the sinner, behold our cries.","But you did not, says God, behold nor regard My cries.","But, Lord, saith the sinner, let our beseeching find place in Thy compassions.","But, saith God, I also beseeched, and I was not heard.","But Lord, says the sinner, our sins lie hard upon us.","But I offered you pardon when time was, says God, and then you did utterly reject it.","But, Lord, says the sinner, let us therefore have it now.","But now the door is shut, saith God.",And what then?,"Why, then, by way of retaliation, God will serve them as they have served Him; and so the wind-up of the whole will be this--they shall have like for like.","Time was when they would have none of Him, and now will God have none of them.","Time was when they cast God behind their back, and now He will cast away their soul.","Time was when they would not heed His calls, and now He will not heed their cries.","Time was when they abhorred Him, and now His soul also abhorreth them (Zech 11:8).","This is now by way of retaliation--like for like, scorn for scorn, repulse for repulse, contempt for contempt; according to that which is written, 'Therefore it is come to pass, that as He cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the Lord' (Zech 7:13).","And thus I have also showed you that the loss of the soul is double--lost by man, lost by God.",But oh!,who thinks of this?,"who, I say, that now makes light of God, of His Word, His servants, and ways, once dreams of such retaliation, though God to warn them hath even, in the day of His patience, threatened to do it in the day of His wrath, saying, 'Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out My hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all My counsel, and would none of My reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.","Then shall they call upon Me, but I will not answer; they shall seek Me early, but they shall not find Me' (Prov 1:24-28).",I will do unto them as they have done unto Me; and what unrighteousness is in all this?,"But, [The loss of the soul most fearful.]","Thirdly, As the loss of the soul is a loss peculiar to itself, and a loss double, so, in the third place, it is a loss most fearful, because it is a loss attended with the most heavy curse of God.","This is manifest both in the giving of the rule of life, and also in, and at the time of execution for, the breach of that rule.",It is manifest at the giving of the rule--'Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them.,"And all the people shall say, Amen' (Deu 27:26; Gal 3:10).","It is also manifest that it shall be so at the time of execution--'Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels' (Matt 25:41).","What this curse is, none do know so well as God that giveth it, and as the fallen angels, and the spirits of damned men that are now shut up in the prison of hell, and bear it.",But certainly it is the chief and highest of all kind of curses.,"To be cursed in the basket and in the store, in the womb and in the barn, in my cattle and in my body, are but flea-bitings to this, though they are also insupportable in themselves; only in general it may be described thus.","But to touch upon this curse, it lieth in deprivation of all good, and in a being swallowed up of all the most fearful miseries that a holy, and just, and eternal God can righteously inflict, or lay upon the soul of a sinful man.","Now let Reason here come in and exercise itself in the most exquisite manner; yea, let him now count up all, and all manner of curses and torments that a reasonable and an immortal soul is, or can be made capable of, and able to suffer under, and when he has done, he shall come infinitely short of this great anathema, this master curse which God has reserved amongst His treasuries, and intends to bring out in that day of battle and war, which He purposeth to make upon damned souls in that day.16 And this God will do, partly as a retaliation, as the former, and partly by way of revenge.",1.,"By way of retaliation: 'As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.'","Again, 'As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones; let it be unto him as a garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually' (Psa 109:17-19).","'Let this,' saith Christ, 17 'be the reward of mine adversaries from the Lord' (vs. 20 etc).",2.,"As this curse comes by way of retaliation, so it cometh by way of revenge.","God will right the wrongs that sinners have done Him, will repay vengeance for the despite and reproach wherewith they have affronted Him, and will revenge the quarrel of His covenant.","And the beginning of revenges are terrible, (Deu 31:41,42); what, then, will the whole execution be, when He shall come in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ?","And, therefore, this curse is executed in wrath, in jealousy, in anger, in fury; yea, the heavens and the earth shall be burned up with the fire of that jealousy in which the great God will come, when He cometh to curse the souls of sinners, and when He cometh to defy the ungodly, (2 Thess 1: 7-9).","It is little thought of, but the manner of the coming of God to judge the world declares what the souls of impenitent sinners must look for then.","It is common among men, when we see the form of a man's countenance changed, when we see fire sparkle out of his eyes, when we read rage and fury in every cast of his face, even before he says aught, or doth aught either, to conclude that some fearful thing is now to be done (Dan 3:19,23).","Why, it is said of Christ when He cometh to judgment, that the heavens and the earth fly away, as not being able to endure His looks, (Rev 20:11,12); that His angels are clad in flaming fire, and that the elements melt with fervent heat; and all this is, that the perdition of ungodly men might be completed, 'from the presence of the Lord, in the heat of His anger, from the glory of His power' (2 Pet 3:7; 2 Thess 1:8,9).","Therefore, God will now be revenged, and so ease Himself of His enemies, when He shall cause curses like millstones to fall as thick as hail on 'the hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his trespasses' (Psa 68:2l).","But, [The loss of the soul a loss everlasting.]","Fourthly, As the loss of the soul is a loss peculiar to itself, a loss double, and a loss most fearful, so it is a loss everlasting.","The soul that is lost is never to be found again, never to be recovered again, never to be redeemed again, its banishment from God is everlasting; the fire in which it burns, and by which it must be tormented, is a fire that is ever, everlasting fire, everlasting burnings; the adder, the snake, the stinging worm, dieth not, nor is the fire quenched; and this is a fearful thing.","A man may endure to touch the fire with a short touch, and away; but to dwell with everlasting burnings, that is fearful.","Oh, then, what is dwelling with them, and in them, for ever and ever!","We use to say, light burdens far carried are heavy; what, then, will it be to bear that burden, that guilt, that the law and the justice and wrath of God will lay upon the lost soul for ever?","Now tell the stars, now tell the drops of the sea, and now tell the blades of grass that are spread upon the face of all the earth, if thou canst: and yet sooner mayest thou do this than count the thousands of millions of thousands of years that a damned soul shall lie in hell.","Suppose every star that is now in the firmament was to burn, by himself, one by one, a thousand years apiece, would it not be a long while before the last of them was burned out?",and yet sooner might that be done than the damned soul be at the end of punishment.,There are three things couched under this last head that will fill up the punishment of a sinner.,1.,"The first is, that it is everlasting.",2.,"The second is, that, therefore, it will be impossible for the souls in hell ever to say, Now we are got half way through our sorrows.",3.,"The third is, and yet every moment they shall endure eternal punishment.",1.,"The first I have touched upon already, and, therefore, shall not enlarge; only I would ask the wanton or unthinking sinner, whether twenty, or thirty, or forty years of the deceitful pleasures of sin is so rich a prize, as that a man may well venture the ruin, that everlasting burnings will make upon his soul for the obtaining of them, and living a few moments in them.","Sinner, consider this before I go any further, or before thou readest one line more.","If thou hast a soul, it concerns thee; if there be a hell, it concerns thee; and if there be a God that can and will punish the soul for sin everlastingly in hell, it concerns thee; because, 2.","In the second place, it will be impossible for the damned soul ever to say, I am now got half way through my sorrows.","That which has no end, has no middle.","Sinner, make a round circle, or ring, upon the ground, of what bigness thou wilt; this done, go thy way upon that circle, or ring, until thou comest to the end thereof; but that, sayest thou, I can never do; because it has no end.","I answer, but thou mayest as soon do that as wade half way through the lake of fire that is prepared for impenitent souls.","Sinner, what wilt thou take to make a mountain of sand that will reach as high as the sun is at noon?",I know that thou wilt not be engaged in such a work; because it is impossible thou shouldst ever perform it.,But I dare say the task is greater when the sinner has let out himself to sin for a servant; because the wages is everlasting burnings.,"I know thou mayest perform thy service; but the wages, the judgment, the punishment is so endless, that thou, when thou hast been in it more millions of years than can be numbered, art not, nor never yet shalt be, able to say, I am half way through it.","And yet, 3.",That soul shall partake every moment of that punishment that is eternal.,"'Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire' (Jude 7).",(1.),They shall endure eternal punishment in the nature of punishment.,"There is no punishment here wherewith one man can chastise another that can deserve a greater title than that of transient, or temporary punishment; but the punishment there is eternal, even in every stripe that is given, and in every moment that it grappleth with the soul; even every twinge, every gripe, and every stroke that justice inflicteth, leaveth anguish that, of their condition according as will best stand with in the nature of punishment, is eternal behind it.","It is eternal, because it is from God, and lasts for ever and ever.","The justice that inflicts it has not a beginning, and it is this justice in the operations of it that is always dealing with the soul.",(2.),"All the workings of the soul under this punishment are such as cause it, in its sufferings, to endure that which is eternal.","It can have no thought of the end of punishment, but it is presently recalled by the decreed gulf that bindeth them under perpetual punishment.","The great fixed gulf, they know, will keep them in their present place, and not suffer them to go to heaven (Luke 16:26).","And now there is no other place but heaven or hell to be in; for then the earth, and the works that are therein, will be burned up.","Read the text, 'But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also and all the works that are therein, shall be burned up' (2 Peter 3:10).","If, then, there will be no third place, it standeth in their minds, as well as in God's decree, that their punishments shall be eternal; so, then, sorrows, anguish, tribulation, grief, woe, and pain, will, in every moment of its abiding upon the soul, not only flow from thoughts of what has been, and what is, but also from what will be, and that for ever and ever.","Thus every thought that is truly grounded in the cause and nature of their state will roll, toss, and tumble them up and down in the cogitations and fearful apprehensions of the lastingness of their damnation.","For, I say, their minds, their memories, their understandings, and consciences, will all, and always, be swallowed up with 'for ever;' yea, they themselves will, by the means of these things, be their own tormentors for ever.",(3.),"There will not be spaces, as days, months, years, and the like, as now; though we make bold so to speak, the better to present our thoughts to each other's capacities; for then there shall be time no longer; also, day and night shall then be come to an end.","'He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end' (Job 26:10).",Until the end of light with darkness.,"Now when time, and day, and night, are come to an end, then there comes in eternity, as there was before the day, and night, or time, was created; and when this is come, punishment nor glory must none of them be measured by days, or months, or years, but by eternity itself.","Nor shall those concerned either in misery or glory reckon of their now new state, as they need to reckon of things in this world; but they shall be suited in their capacities, in their understandings and apprehensions, to judge and count of their condition according as will best stand with their state in eternity.18 Could we but come to an understanding of things done in heaven and hell, as we understand how things are done in this world, we should be strangely amazed to see how the change of places and of conditions has made a change in the understandings of men, and in the manner of their enjoyment of things.","But this we must let alone till the next world, and until our launching into it; and then, whether we be of the right or left hand ones, we shall well know the state and condition of both kingdoms.","In the meantime, let us addict ourselves to the belief of the Scriptures of truth, for therein is revealed the way to that of eternal life, and how to escape the damnation of the soul (Matt 25:33).","But thus much for the loss of the soul, unto which let me add, for a conclusion, these verses following:--     These cry alas!","But all in vain;         They stick fast in the mire;     They would be rid of present pain,         Yet set themselves on fire.","Darkness is their perplexity,         Yet do they hate the light;     They always see their misery,         Yet are themselves, all night.","They are all dead, yet live they do,         Yet neither live nor die;     They die to weal, and live to woe--19         This is their misery.","Now will confusion so possess,         These monuments of ire,     And so confound them with distress,         And trouble their desire,     That what to think, or what to do,         Or where to lay their head,     They know not: 'tis the damned's woe,         To live, and yet be dead.","These castaways would fain have life,         But know they never shall;     They would forget their dreadful plight.",But that sticks fast'st of all.,"God, Christ, and heav'n, they know are best,         Yet dare not on them think;     They know the saints enjoy their rest,         While they their tears do drink.",[OF THE CAUSE OF THE LOSS OF THE SOUL.],"FOURTH, And now I am come to the fourth thing--that is, to show you the cause of the loss of the soul.","That men have souls, that souls are great things, that souls may be lost, this I have showed you already; wherefore I now proceed to show you the cause of this loss.","The cause is laid down in the 18th chapter of Ezekiel, in these words--'Behold, all souls,' says God, 'are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die' (5:4).",[Sin the cause of the loss of his soul.],"First, It is sin, then, or sinning against God, that is the cause of dying, or damning in hell fire, for that must be meant by dying; otherwise, to die, according to our ordinary acceptation of the notion, the soul is not capable of, it being indeed immortal, as hath been afore asserted.","So, then, the soul that sinneth--that is, and persevering in the same--that soul shall die, be cast away, or damned; yea, to ascertain us of the undoubted truth of this, the Holy Ghost doth repeat it again, and that in this very chapter, saying, 'The soul that sinneth, it shall die' (5:20).","Now, the soul may divers ways be said to sin against God; as, 1.","In its receiving of sin into its bosom, and in its retaining and entertaining of it there.","Sin must first be received before it can act in, or be acted by, the soul.","Our first parents first received it in the suggestion or motion, and then acted it.","Now it is not here to be disputed when sin was received by the soul, so much as whether ever the soul received sin; for if the soul has indeed received sin into itself, then it has sinned, and by doing so, has made itself an object of the wrath of God, and a fire brand of hell.","I say, I will not here dispute when sin was received by the soul, but it is apparent enough that it received it betimes, because in old time every child that was brought unto the Lord was to be redeemed, and that at a month old, (Exo 13:13; 34:20; Num 18:15, 16); which, to be sure, was very early, and implied that then, even then, the soul in God's judgment stood before Him as defiled and polluted with sin.","But although I said I will not dispute at what time the soul may be said to receive sin, yet it is evident that it was precedent to the redemption made mention of just before, and so before the person redeemed had attained the age of a month.","And that God might, in the language of Moses, give us to see cause of the necessity of this redemption, he first distinguisheth, and saith, 'The firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat,' did not need this redemption, for they were clean, or holy.","But the firstborn of men, who was taken in lieu of the rest of the children, and the 'firstling of unclean beasts, thou shalt surely redeem,' saith He.","But why was the firstborn of men coupled with unclean beasts, but because they are both unclean?","The beast was unclean by God's ordination, but the other was unclean by sin.","Now, then, it will be demanded, how a soul, before it was a month old, could receive sin to the making of itself unclean?","I answer, There are two ways of receiving, one active, the other passive; this last is the way by which the soul at first receiveth sin, and by so receiving, becometh culpable, because polluted and defiled by it.",And this passive way of receiving is often mentioned in Scripture.,"Thus the pans received the ashes, (Exo 27:3); thus the molten sea received three thousand baths, (2 Chron 4:5); thus the ground receiveth the seed, (Matt 13:20-23); and this receiving is like that of the wool which receiveth the dye, either black, white, or red; and as the fire that receiveth the water till it be all quenched therewith: or as the water receiveth such stinking and poisonous matter into it, as for the sake of it, it is poured out and spilt upon the ground.",But whence should the soul thus receive sin?,"I answer, from the body, while it is in the mother's belly; the body comes from polluted man, and therefore is polluted (Psa 51: 5).",'Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?',(Job 14:4).,"The soul comes from God's hand, and therefore as so is pure and clean: but being put into this body, it is tainted, polluted, and defiled with the taint, stench, and filth of sin; nor can this stench and filth be by man purged out, when once from the body got into the soul; sooner may the blackamoor change his skin, or the leopard his spots, than the soul, were it willing, might purge itself of this pollution.","'Though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before Me, saith the Lord God' (Jer 2:22).",2.,"But as I said, the soul has not only received sin, but retains it, holds it, and shows no kind of resistance.","It is enough that the soul is polluted and defiled, for that is sufficient to provoke God to cast it away; for which of you would take a cloth annoyed with stinking, ulcerous sores, to wipe your mouth withal, or to thrust it into your bosoms?",and the soul is polluted with far worse pollution than any such can be.,"But this is not all; it retains sin as the wool retains the dye, or as the infected water receives the stench or poisonous scent; I say, it retains it willingly; for all the power of the soul is not only captivated by a seizure of sin upon the soul, but it willingly, heartily, unanimously, universally falleth in with the natural filth and pollution that is in sin, to the estranging of itself from God, and an obtaining of an intimacy and compliance with the devil.","Now this being the state and condition of the soul from the belly,20 yea, from before it sees the light of this world, what can be concluded but that God is offended with it?","For how can it otherwise be, since there is holiness and justice in God?","Hence those that are born of a woman, whose original is by carnal conception with man, are said to be as serpents so soon as born.","'The wicked (and all at first are so) go astray as soon as they be born, speakings lies.","Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder, that stoppeth her ear' (Psa 58:3,4).","They go astray from the belly; but that they would not do, if aught of the powers of their soul were unpolluted.",'But their poison is like the poison of a serpent.',Their poison--what is that?,"Their pollution, their original pollution, that is as the poison of a serpent--to wit, not only deadly, for so poison is, but also hereditary.","It comes from the old one, from the sire and dam; yea, it is also now become connatural to and with them, and is of the same date with the child as born into the world.","The serpent has not her poison, in the original of it, either from imitation or from other infective things abroad, though it may by such things be helped forward and increased; but she brings it with her in her bowels, in her nature, and it is to her as suitable to her present condition as it is that which is most sweet and wholesome to other of the creatures.","So, then, every soul comes into the world as poisoned with sin; nay, as such which have poison connatural to them; for it has not only received sin as the wool has received the dye, but it retaineth it.","The infection is got so deep, it has taken the black so effectually, that the tint, the very fire of hell, can never purge the soul therefrom.","And that the soul has received this infection thus early, and that it retains it so surely, is not only signified by children coming into the world besmeared in their mother's blood, and by the firstborn's being redeemed at a month old, but also by the first inclinations and actions of children when they are so come into the world (Exo 26).","Who sees not that lying, pride, disobedience to parents, and hypocrisy, do put forth themselves in children before they know that they do either well or ill in so doing, or before they are capable to learn either of these arts by imitation, or seeing understandingly the same things done first by others?","He that sees not that they do it naturally from a principle, from an inherent principle, is either blinded, and has retained his darkness by the same sin as they, or has suffered himself to be swayed by a delusion from him who at first infused this spawn of sin into man's nature.","Nor doth the averseness of children to morality a little demonstrate what has been said; for as it would make a serpent sick, should one give it a strong antidote against his poison, so then are children, and never more than then, disturbed in their minds, when a strict hand and a stiff rein by moral discipline is maintained over and upon them.","True, sometimes restraining grace corrects them, but that is not of themselves; but more oft hypocrisy is the great and first moving wheel to all their seeming compliances with admonitions, which indulgent parents are apt to overlook, yea, and sometimes, through unadvisedness, to count for the principles of grace.",I speak now of that which comes before conversion.,"But as I said before, I would not now dispute, only I have thought good thus to urge these things to make my assertion manifest, and to show what is the cause of the damnation of the soul.",3.,"Again; as the soul receives sin, and retains it, so it also doth entertain it--that is, countenance, smile upon, and like its complexion and nature well.","A man may detain--that is, hold fast--a thing which yet he doth not regard; but when he entertains, then he countenances, likes, and delights in the company.","Sin, then, is first received by the soul, as has been afore explained, and by that reception is polluted and defiled.",This makes it hateful in the eyes of justice: it is now polluted.,"Then, secondly, this sin is not only received, but retained--that is, it sticks so fast, abides so fixedly in the soul, that it cannot be gotten out; this is the cause of the continuation of abhorrence; for if God abhors because there is a being of sin there, it must needs be that he should continue to abhor, since sin continues to have a being there.","But then, in the third place, sin is not only received, detained, but entertained by the now defiled and polluted soul; wherefore this must needs be a cause of the continuance of anger, and that with aggravation.","When I say, entertained, I do not mean as men entertain their enemies, with small and great shot, 21 but as they entertain those whom they like, and those that are got into their affections.","22 And therefore the wrath of God must certainly be let out upon the soul, to the everlasting damnation of it.","Now that the soul doth thus entertain sin, is manifest by these several particulars-- (1.)","It hath admitted it with complacence and delight into every chamber of the soul; I mean, it has been delightfully admitted to an entertainment by all the powers or faculties of the soul.","The soul hath chosen it rather than God: it also, at God's command, refuseth to let it go; yea, it chooseth that doctrine, and loveth it best, since it must have a doctrine, that has most of sin and baseness in it (Isa 65:12; 66:3).","They 'say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits' (Isa 30:10).","These are signs that the soul with liking hath entertained sin; and if there be at any time, as indeed there is, a warrant issued out from the mouth of God to apprehend, to condemn, and mortify sin, why then, (2.)","These shifts the souls of sinners do presently make for the saving of sin from those things that by the Word men are commanded to do unto it-- (a) They will, if possible, hide it, and not suffer it to be discovered.",'He that hideth his sins23 shall not prosper' (Prov 28:13).,"And again, they hide it, and refuse to let it go (Job 20:12,13).","This is an evident sign that the soul has a favour for sin, and that with liking it, entertains it.","(b) As it will hide it, so it will excuse it, and plead that this and that piece of wickedness is no such evil thing; men need not be so nice, and make such a pother24 about it, calling those that cry out so hotly against it, men more nice than wise.","Hence the prophets of old used to be called madmen, and the world would reply against their doctrine, Wherein have we been so wearisome to God, and what have we spoken so much against Him?","(Mal 1:6,7; 3:8,13).","(c) As the soul will do this, so to save sin, it will cover it with names of virtue, either moral or civil; and of this God greatly complains, yea, breaks into anger for this, saying, 'Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; and put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter' (Isa 5:20)!","(d) If convictions and discovery of sin be so strong and so plain, that the soul cannot deny but that it is sin, and that God is offended therewith; then it will give flattering promises to God that it will indeed put it away; but yet it will prefix a time that shall be long first, if it also then at all performs it, saying, Yet a little sleep, yet a little slumber, yet a little folding of sin in mine arms, till I am older, till I am richer, till I have had more of the sweetness and the delights of sin.","Thus, 'their soul delighteth in their abominations' (Isa 66:3).","(e) If God yet pursues, and will see whether this promise of putting sin out of doors shall be fulfilled by the soul, why then, it will be partial in God's law; it will put away some, and keep some; put away the grossest, and keep the finest; put away those that can best be spared, and keep the most profitable for a help at a pinch (Mal 2:9).","(f) Yes, if all sin must be abandoned, or the soul shall have no rest, why then, the soul and sin will part (with such a parting as it is), even as Phaltiel parted with David's wife, with an ill will and a sorrowful mind; or as Orpha left her mother, with a kiss (2 Sam 3:16; Ruth 1:14).","(g) And if at any time they can, or shall, meet with each other again, and nobody never the wiser, O, what courting will be betwixt sin and the soul?",And this is called doing of things in the dark (Eze 8:12).,"By all these, and many more things that might be instanced, it is manifest that sin has a friendly entertainment by the soul, and that therefore the soul is guilty of damnation; for what do all these things argue, but that God, His Word, His ways, and graces, are out of favour with the soul, and that sin and Satan are its only pleasant companions?","But, [How sin, by the help of the soul, destroys it.]","Secondly, That I may yet show you what a great thing sin is with the soul that is to be damned, I will show how sin, by the help of the soul, is managed, from the motion of sin, even till it comes to the very act; for sin cannot come to an act without the help of the soul.","The body doth little here, as I shall further show you anon.","There is then a motion of sin presented to the soul (and whether presented by sin itself or the devil, we will not at this time dispute); motions of sin, and motions to sin there are, and always the end of the motions of sin are to prevail with the soul to help that motion into an act.","But, I say, there is a motion to sin moved to the soul; or, as James calls it, a conception.","Now behold how the soul deals with this motion in order to the finishing of sin, that death might follow (Rom 7:5).",1.,"This motion is taken notice of by the soul, but is not resisted nor striven against, only the soul lifts up its eyes upon it, and sees that there is present a motion to sin, a motion of sin presented to the soul, that the soul might midwife it from the conception into the world.",2.,"Well, notice being taken that a motion to sin is present, what follows but that the fancy or imagination of the soul taketh it home to it, and doth not only look upon it and behold it more narrowly, but begins to trick and trim up the sin to the pleasing of itself and of all the powers of the soul.","That this is true, is evident, because God findeth fault with the imagination as with that which lendeth to sin the first hand, and that giveth to it the first lift towards its being helped forward to act.","'And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth' (Gen 6:5,12,13).","That is, many abominable actions were done; for all flesh had corrupted God's way upon the earth.",But how came this to be so?,"Why, every imagination of the thoughts, or of the motions that were in the heart to sin, was evil, only evil, and that continuously.","The imagination of the thoughts was evil--that is, such as tended not to deaden or stifle, but such as tended to animate and forward the motions or thoughts of sin into action.","Every imagination of the thoughts--that which is here called a thought, by Paul to the Romans, called a motion.","Now the imagination should, and would, had it been on God's side, so have conceived of this motion of and to sins, all to have presented it in all its features so ugly, so ill favoured, and so unreasonable a thing to the soul, that the soul should forthwith have let down the sluice, and pulled up the drawbridge, put a stop, with greatest defiance, to the motion now under consideration; but the imagination being defiled, it presently, at the very first view or noise of the motion of sin, so acted as to forward the bringing the said motion or thought into act.","So, then, the thought of sin, or motion thereto, is first of all entertained by the imagination and fancy of the soul, and thence conveyed to the rest of the powers of the soul to be condemned, if the imagination be good; but to be helped forward to the act, if the imagination be evil.","And thus the evil imagination helpeth the motion of and to sin towards the act, even by dressing of it up in that guise and habit that may best delude the understanding, judgment, and conscience; and that is done after this manner: suppose a motion of sin to commit fornication, to swear, to steal, to act covetously, or the like, be propounded to the fancy and imagination; the imagination, if evil, presently dresseth up this motion in that garb that best suiteth with the nature of the sin.","As, if it be the lust of uncleanness, then is the motion to sin drest up in all the imaginable pleasurableness of that sin; if to covetousness, then is the sin drest up in the profits and honours that attend that sin; and so of theft and the like; but if the motion be to swear, hector, or the like, then is that motion drest up with valour and manliness; and so you may count of the rest of sinful motions; and thus being trimmed up like a Bartholomew baby, 25 it is presented to all the rest of the powers of the soul, where with joint consent it is admired and embraced, to the firing and inflaming all the powers of the soul.",And hence it is that men are said to inflame themselves with their idols under every green tree.,"'And to be as fed horses, neighing after their neighbour's wife' (Jer 5:8).","For the imagination is such a forcible power, that if it putteth forth itself to dress up and present a thing to the soul, whether that thing be evil or good, the rest of the faculties cannot withstand it.","Therefore, when David prayed for the children of Israel, he said, 'I have seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee;' that is, for preparations to build the temple.","'O Lord God,' saith he, 'keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of Thy people, and prepare their heart unto Thee' (1 Chron 29:17, 18).","He knew that as the imagination was prepared, so would the soul be moved, whether by evil or good; therefore as to this, he prays that their imagination might be engaged always with apprehensions of the beauteousness of the temple, that they might always, as now, offer willingly for its building.","But, as I said, when the imagination hath thus set forth sin to the rest of the faculties of the soul, they are presently entangled, and fall into a flame of love thereto; this being done, it follows that a purpose to pursue this motion, till it be brought unto act, is the next thing that is resolved on.","Thus Esau, after he had conceived of that profit that would accrue to him by murdering of his brother, fell the next way into a resolve to spill Jacob's blood.","And Rebecca sent for Jacob, and said unto him, 'Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee' (Gen 27:42).",See also (Jer 49:30).,"Nor is this purpose to do an evil without its fruit, for he comforted himself in his evil purpose: 'Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.'","The purpose, therefore, being concluded, in the next place the invention is diligently set to work to find out what means, methods, and ways, will be thought best to bring this purpose into practice, and this motion to sin into action.",Esau invented the death of his brother when his father was to be carried to his grave (Gen 27:41).,David purposed to make Uriah father his bastard child by making of him drunk (2 Sam 11:13).,"Amnon purposed to ravish Tamar, and the means that he invented to do it were by feigning himself sick.","Absalom purposed to kill Amnon, and invented to do it at a feast (2 Sam13:32).","Judas purposed to sell Christ, and invented to betray him in the absence of the people (Luke 22:3-6).","The Jews purposed to kill Paul, and invented to entreat the judge of a blandation26 to send for him, that they might murder him as he went (Acts 23:12-15).","Thus you see how sin is, in the motion of it, handed through the soul--first, it comes into the fancy or imagination, by which it is so presented to the soul, as to inflame it with desire to bring it into act; so from this desire the soul proceedeth to a purpose of enjoying, and from a purpose of enjoying to inventing how, or by what means, it had best to attempt the accomplishing of it.","But, further, when the soul has thus far, by its wickedness, pursued the motion of sin to bring it into action, then to the last thing; to wit, to endeavours, to take the opportunity, which, by the invention, is judged most convenient; so to endeavours it goes, till it has finished sin, and finished, in finishing of that, its own fearful damnation.","'Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death' (James 1:15).","And who knows, but God and the soul, how many lets, hindrances, convictions, fears, frights, misgivings, and thoughts of the judgment of God, all this while are passing and repassing, turning and returning, over the face of the soul?","how many times the soul is made to start, look back, and tremble, while it is pursuing the pleasure, profit, applause, or preferment that sin, when finished, promiseth to yield unto the soul?","for God is such a lover of the soul, that He seldom lets it go on in sin, but He cries to it, by His Word and providences, 'Oh!",do not this abominable thing that I hate!',"(Jer 44: 4); especially at first, until it shall have hardened itself, and so provoked Him to give it up in sin-revenging judgment to its own ways and doings, which is the terriblest judgment under heaven; and this brings me to the third thing, the which I now will speak to.",3.,"As the soul receives, detains, entertains, and wilily worketh to bring sin from the motion into act, so it abhorreth to be controlled and taken off of this work--'My soul loathed them,' says God, 'and their soul also abhorred Me' (Zech 6:8).","My soul loathed them, because they were so bad; and their souls abhorred Me, because I am so good.","Sin, then, is the cause of the loss of the soul; because it hath set the soul, or, rather, because the soul of love to sin hath set itself against God.","'Woe unto their soul, for they have rewarded evil unto themselves'(Isa 3:9).",[Through sin the soul sets itself against God.],"Third, That you may the better perceive that the soul, through sin, has set itself against God, I will propose, and speak briefly to, these two things:-- I.",The law.,II.,The gospel.,I.,For the law.,"God has given it for a rule of life, either as written in their natures, or as inserted in the Holy Scriptures; I say, for a rule of life to all the children of men.","But what have men done, or how have they carried it to this law of their Creator; let us see, and that from the mouth of God himself.",1.,'They have not hearkened unto My words' (Jer 6:19).,2.,'They have forsaken My law' (Jer 9:13).,3.,"They 'have forsaken Me, and have not kept My law' (Jer 16:11).",4.,"They have not 'walked in My law, nor in My statutes' (Jer 44: 4).",5.,'Her priests have violated My law' (Eze 22:26).,6.,"And, saith God, 'I have written to him the great things of My law, but they were counted as a strange thing.'",(Hos 8:12).,"Now, whence should all this disobedience arise?","Not from the unreasonableness of the commandment, but from the opposition that is lodged in us against God, and the enmity that it entertains against goodness.","Hence the apostle speaks of the emnity, and says, that men are enemies in their minds, their souls, as is manifest by wicked works (Col 1:21).","This, if men went no further, must needs be highly provoking to a just and holy God: yea, so highly offensive is it, that, to show the heat of His anger, He saith, 'Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil,' and this evil with a witness, 'of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile,' that doth evil (Rom 2:8,9).",That breaketh the law; for that evil He is crying out against now.,"But, II.","To speak of the gospel, and of the carriage of sinful souls towards God under that dispensation.","The gospel is a revelation of a sovereign remedy, provided by God, through Christ, for the health and salvation of those that have made themselves objects of wrath by the breach of the law of works; this is manifest by all the Scripture.","But how doth the soul carry it towards God, when He offereth to deal with it under and by this dispensation of grace?","Why, just as it carried it under the law of works: they oppose, they contradict, they blaspheme, and forbid that this gospel be mentioned (Acts 13:45; 27:6).","What higher affront or contempt can be offered to God, and what greater disdain can be shown against the gospel?",(2 Tim 2:25; 1 Thess 2:14-16).,"Yet all this the poor soul, to its own wrong, offereth against the way of its own salvation; as it is said in the Word of truth, 'He that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate Me love death' (Prov 8:36).","But, further, the soul despiseth not the gospel in that revelation of it only, but the great and chief bringer thereof, with the manner, also, of His bringing of it.","The Bringer, the great Bringer of the gospel, is the good Lord Jesus Christ himself; He 'came and preached peace to them that the law proclaimed war against; became and preached peace to them that were afar off, and to them that were nigh' (Eph 2:17).","And it is worth your observation to take notice how He came, and that was, and still is, as He is set forth in the word of the gospel; to wit, first, as making peace Himself to God for us in and by the blood of His cross; and then, as bearing (as set out by the gospel) the very characters of His sufferings before our faces in every tender of the gospel of His grace unto us.","And to touch a little upon the dress in which, by the gospel, Christ presenteth unto us while He offereth unto sinful souls His peace, by the tenders thereof.",1.,"He is set forth as born for us, to save our souls (Isa 9:6; Luke 2:9-12).",2.,"He is set forth before us as bearing of our sins for us, and suffering God's wrath for us (1 Cor 15:3; Gal 3:13).",3.,"He is set forth before us as fulfilling the law for us, and as bringing of everlasting righteousness to us for our covering (Rom 5:4; Dan 9:24).","Again, as to the manner of His working out the salvation of sinners for them, that they might have peace and joy, and heaven and glory, for ever.",(1.),"He is set forth as sweating of blood while He was in His agony, wrestling with the thoughts of death, which He was to suffer for our sins, that He might save the soul (Luke 22:44).",(2.),"He is set forth as crying, weeping, and mourning under the lashes of justice that He put Himself under, and was willing to bear for our sins (Heb 5:7).",(3.),"He is set forth as betrayed, apprehended, condemned, spit on, scourged, buffeted, mocked, crowned with thorns, crucified, pierced with nails and a spear, to save the soul from being betrayed by the devil and sin; to save it from being apprehended by justice, and condemned by the law; to save it from being spit on, in a way of contempt, by holiness; to save it from being scourged with guilt of sins, as with scorpions; to save it from being continually buffeted by its own conscience; to save it from being mocked at by God; to save it from being crowned with ignominy and shame for ever; to save it from dying the second death; to save it from wounds and grief for ever.","Dost thou understand me, sinful soul?","He wrestled with justice, that thou mightest have rest; He wept and mourned, that thou mightest laugh and rejoice; He was betrayed, that thou mightest go free; was apprehended, that thou mightest escape; He was condemned, that thou mightest be justified; and was killed, that thou mightest live; He wore a crown of thorns, that thou mightest wear a crown of glory; and was nailed to the cross, with His arms wide open, to show with what freeness all His merits shall be bestowed on the coming soul; and how heartily He will receive it into His bosom?","Further, all this He did of mere good will, and offereth the benefit thereof unto thee freely; yea, He cometh unto thee, in the word of the gospel, with the blood running down from His head upon His face, with His tears abiding upon His cheeks, with the holes as fresh in His hands and His feet, and as with the blood still bubbling out of His side, to pray thee to accept of the benefit, and to be reconciled to God thereby (2 Cor 5).",But what saith the sinful soul to this?,"I do not ask what he saith with his lips, for he will assuredly flatter God with his mouth; but what doth his actions and carriages declare as to his acceptance of this incomparable benefit?","For 'a wicked man speaketh with his feet, and teacheth with his fingers' (Prov 6:12,13).","With his feet--that is, by the way he goeth: and with his fingers--that is, by his acts and doings.","So, then, what saith he by his goings, by his sets and doings, unto this incomparable benefit, thus brought unto him from the Father, by His only Son, Jesus Christ?",What saith he?,"Why, he saith that he doth not at all regard this Christ, nor value the grace thus tendered unto him in the gospel.",1.,"He saith, that he regardeth not this Christ, that he seeth nothing in Him why he should admit Him to be entertained in his affections.","Therefore the prophet, speaking in the person of sinners, says, 'He (Christ) hath no form nor comeliness, and when we shall see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him;' and then adds, to show what he meaneth by his thus speaking, saying, 'he is despised and rejected of men' (Isa 53:2,3).","All this is spoken with reference to His person, and it was eminently fulfilled upon Him in the days of His flesh, when He was hated, maligned, and persecuted to death by sinners; and is still fulfilled in the souls of sinners, in that they cannot abide to think of Him with thoughts that have a tendency in them to separate them and their lusts asunder, and to the making of them to embrace Him for their darling, and the taking up of their cross to follow Him.","All this sinners speak out with loud voices, in that they stop their ears and shut their eyes as to Him, but open them wide and hearken diligently to anything that pleaseth the flesh, and that is a nursery to sin.","But, 2.","As they despise, and reject, and do not regard His person, so they do not value the grace that He tendereth unto them by the gospel; this is plain by that indifferency of spirit that always attends them when, at any time, they hear thereof, or when it is presented unto them.","I may safely say, that the most of men who are concerned in a trade, will be more vigilant in dealing with a twelvepenny customer than they will be with Christ when He comes to make unto them, by the gospel, a tender of the incomparable grace of God.","Hence they are called fools, because a price is put into their hands to get wisdom, and they have no heart unto it (Prov 18:16).","And hence, again, it is that that bitter complaint is made, 'But My people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of Me' (Psa 81:11).","Now, these things being found, as practised by the souls of sinners, must needs, after a wonderful manner, provoke; wherefore, no marvel that the heavens are bid to be astonished at this, and that damnation shall seize upon the soul for this (Jer 2).","And indeed, the soul that doth thus by practice, though with his mouth--as who doth not?","he shall show much love, he doth, interpretatively, say these things:-- (1.)","That he loveth sin better than grace, and darkness better than light, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed, 'And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness more than light (as is manifest), because their deeds were evil' (John 3:19).",(2.),"They do, also, by their thus rejecting of Christ and grace, say, that for what the law can do to them, they value it not; they regard not its thundering threatenings, nor will they shrink when they come to endure the execution thereof; wherefore God, to deter them from such bold and desperate ways, that do, interpretatively, fully declare that they make such desperate conclusions, insinuates that the burden of the curse thereof is intolerable, saying, 'Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee?","I, the Lord, have spoken it, and will do it' (Eze 22:14).",(3.),"Yea, by their thus doing, they do as good as say that they will run the hazard of a sentence of death at the day of judgment, and that they will, in the meantime, join issue, and stand a trial at that day with the great and terrible God.","What else means their not hearkening to Him, their despising of His Son, and the rejecting of His grace; yea I say again, what else means their slighting of the curse of the law, and their choosing to abide in their sins till the day of death and judgment?","And thus I have showed you the causes of the loss of the soul; and, assuredly, these things are no fables.",Objection.,"But some may object, and say, But you denounce all against the soul; the soul, as if the body were in no fault at all; or, as if there were no punishment assigned for the body.",Answer 1.,"The soul must be the part punished, because the soul is that which sins.","'Every sin that a man doeth is without the body,' fornication or adultery excepted (1 Cor 6:18).","'Is without the body; that is, as to the wilily inventing, contriving, and finding out ways to bring the motions of sin into action.","For, alas!",What can the body do as to these?,"It is in a manner wholly passive; yea, altogether as to the lusting and purposing to do the wickedness, excepting the sin before excepted; ay, and not excepting that, as to the rise of that sin; for even that, with all the rest, ariseth and proceedeth out of the heart--the soul; 'For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: all these evil things come from within, and defile the man' (Mark 7:21-23).","That is, the outward man.","But a difference must always be put betwixt defiling and being defiled, that which defileth being the worst; not but that the body shall have its share of judgment, for body and soul must be destroyed in hell (Luke 12:4,5; Matt 10:28).","The body as the instrument, the soul as the actor; but oh!","the soul, the soul, the soul is the sinner; and, therefore, the soul, as the principal, must be punished.","And that God's indignation burneth most against the soul appears in that death hath seized upon every soul already; for the Scripture saith, that every natural or unconverted man is dead (Eph 2:1-3).",Dead!,How?,Is his body dead?,"No, verily; his body liveth, but his soul is dead (1 Tim 5:6).",Dead!,But with what death?,"Dead to God, and to all things gospelly good, by reason of that benumbing, stupifying, and senselessness, that, by God's just judgment for and by sin, hath swallowed up the soul.","Yea, if you observe, you shall see that the soul goeth first, or before, in punishment, not only by what has been said already, in that the soul is first made a partaker of death, but in that God first deals with the soul by convictions, yea, and terrors, perhaps, while the body is well; or, in that He giveth up the soul to judicial hardness and further blindness, while He leaveth the body to do His office in the world; yea, and also when the day of death and dissolution is come, the body is spared, while the soul is tormented in unutterable torment in hell.","And so, I say, it shall be spared, and the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto it, while the soul mourneth in hell for sin.","It is true, at the day of judgment, because that is the last and final judgment of God on men, then the body and soul shall be re-united, or joined together again, and shall then, together, partake of that recompence for their wickedness which is meet.","When I say, the body is spared and the soul tormented, I mean not that the body is not then, at death, made to partake of the wages of sin, 'for the wages of sin is death' (Rom 3:23).","But I mean, the body partakes then but of temporal death, which, as to sense and feeling, is sometimes over presently, and then resteth in the grave, while the soul is tormenting in hell.","Yea, and why is death suffered to slay the body?","I dare say, not chiefly for that the indignation of God most burneth against the body; but the body being the house for the soul in this world, God even pulls down this body, that the soul may be stript naked, and being stript, may be carried to prison, to the place where damned souls are, there to suffer in the beginning of suffering, that punishment that will be endless.",Answer 2.,"Therefore, the soul must be the part most sorely punished, because justice must be distributed with equity.",God is a God of knowledge and judgment; by Him actions are weighed; actions in order to judgment (1 Sam 2).,"Now, by weighing of actions, since He finds the soul to have the deepest hand in sin; and He says that He hath so, of equity the soul is to bear the burden of punishment.",'Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right' in His famous distributing of judgment?,(Gen 18:25).,"'He will not lay upon man more than right, that he should enter into judgment with God' (Job 34:23).","The soul, since deepest in sin, shall also be deepest in punishment.","'Shall one man sin,' said Moses, 'and wilt Thou be wroth with all the congregation?'",(Num 1:22).,"He pleads here for equity in God's distributing of judgment; yea, and so exact is God in the distribution thereof, that He will not punish heathens so as He will punish Jews; wherefore He saith, 'Of the Jew first,' or chiefly, 'and also of the Gentile' (Rom 2:9).","Yea, in hell He has prepared several degrees of punishment for the several sorts or degrees of offenders; And some 'shall receive greater damnation' (Luke 22:47).","And will it not be unmeet for us to think, since God is so elect in all His doings, that He will, without His weights and measures, give to soul and body, as I may say, carelessly, not severally, their punishments, according to the desert and merit of each?",Answer 3.,"The punishment of the soul in hell must needs, to be sure, as to degree, differ from the punishment of the body there.","When I say, differ, I mean, must needs be greater, whether the body be punished with the same fire with the soul, or fire of another nature.","If it be punished with the same fire, yet not in the same way; for the fire of guilt, with the apprehensions of indignation and wrath, are most properly felt and apprehended by the soul, and by the body by virtue of its union with the soul; and so felt by the body, if not only, yet, I think, mostly, by way of sympathy with the soul; and the cause, we say, is worse than the disease; and if the wrath of God, and the apprehensions of it, as discharging itself for sin, and the breach of the law, be that with which the soul is punished, as sure it is: then the body is punished by the effects, or by those influences that the soul, in its torments, has upon the body, by virtue of that great oneness and union that is between them.","But if there be a punishment prepared for the body distinct in kind from that which is prepared for the soul, yet it must be a punishment inferior to that which is prepared for the soul; not that the soul and body shall be severed, but being made of things distinct, their punishments will be by that which is most suitable to each.","I say, it must be inferior, because nothing can be so hot, so tormenting, so intolerably insupportable, as the quickest apprehensions of, and the immediate sinking under, that guilt and indignation that is proportional to the offence.","Should all the wood, and brimstone, and combustible matter on earth be gathered together for the tormenting of one body, yet that cannot yield that torment to that which the sense of guilt and burning-hot application of the indignation of God will do to the soul; yea, suppose the fire wherewith the body is tormented in hell should be seven times hotter than any of our fire; yea, suppose it, again, to be seven times hotter than that which is seven times hotter than ours, yet it must, suppose it to be but created fire, be infinitely short, as to tormenting operations, of the unspeakable wrath of God, when in the heat thereof He applieth it to, and doth punish the soul for sin in hell therewith.","So, then, whether the body be tormented with the same fire wherewith the soul is tormented, or whether the fire be of another kind, yet it is not possible that it should bear the same punishment as to degree, because, or for the causes I have showed.","Nor, indeed, is it meet it should, because the body has not sinned so, so grievously as the soul has done; and God proportioneth the punishment suitable to the offence.",Answer 4.,"With the soul by itself are the most quick and suitable apprehensions of God and His wrath; wherefore, that must needs be made partaker of the sorest punishment in hell; it is the soul that now is the most subtle at discerning, and it is the soul that will be so; then conscience, memory, and understanding, and mind; these will be the seat of torment, since the understanding will let wrath immediately upon these, from what it apprehends of that wrath; conscience will let the wrath of God immediately upon these, from what it fearfully feels of that wrath; the memory will then, as a vessel, receive and retain up to the brim of this wrath, even as it receiveth by the understanding and conscience, the cause of this wrath, and considers the durableness of it; so, then, the soul is the seat and the receiver of wrath, even as it was the receiver and seat of sin; here, then, is sin and wrath upon the soul, the soul in the body, and so soul and body tormented in hell fire.",Answer 5.,"The soul will be most tormented, because strongest; the biggest burden must lie upon the strongest part, especially since, also, it is made capable of it by its sin.","The soul must bear its own punishment, and a great part of the body's too, forasmuch as, so far as apprehension goes, the soul will be quicker at the work than the body.","True, the body, by the help of the soul, will see too, but the soul will see yet abundantly further.","And good reason that the soul should bear part of the punishment of the body, because it was through its allurements that the body yielded to help the soul to sin.","The devil presented sin, the soul took it by the body, and now devil, and soul, and body, and all must be lost, cast away; that is, damned in hell for sin; but the soul must be the burden bearer.",Objection.,"But you say, Doth not this give encouragement to sinners to give way to the body to be in all its members loose, and vain, and wicked, as instruments to sin?",Answer.,No; forasmuch as the body shall also have his share in punishment.,"For though I have said the soul shall have more punishment than the body, yet I have not said, that the body shall at all be eased by that; no, the body will have its due.","And for the better making out of my answer further, consider of these following particulars:-- (1.)","The body will be the vessel to hold the tormented soul in; this will be something; therefore man, damned man, is called a vessel of wrath, a vessel, and that in both body and soul (Rom 9:22).","The soul receiveth wrath unto itself, and the body holdeth that soul that has thus received, and is tormented with, the wrath of God.","Now the body being a vessel to hold this soul that is thus possessed with the wrath of God, must needs itself be afflicted and tormented with that torment, because of its union with the body; therefore the Holy Ghost saith, 'His flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn' (Job 14:22).","Both shall have their torment and misery, for that both joined hand in hand in sin, the soul to bring it to the birth, and the body to midwife it into the world; therefore it saith again, with reference to the body, 'Let the curse come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.'","Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle, etc.",(Psa 109:17-19).,"The body, then, will be tormented as well as the soul, by being a vessel to hold that soul that is now possessed and distressed with the unspeakable wrath and indignation of the Almighty God, and this will be a great deal, if you consider, (2.)","That the body, as a body, will, by reason of its union with the soul, be as sensible, and so as capable in its kind, to receive correction and torment as ever, nay, I think more; for if the quickness of the soul giveth quickness of sense to the body, as in some case, at least, I am apt to think it doth, then forasmuch as the soul will now be most quick, most sharp in apprehension, so the body, by reason of union and sympathy with the soul, will be most quick and most sharp as to sense.","Indeed, if the body should not receive and retain sense, yea, all its senses, by reason of its being a vessel to hold the soul, the torment of the soul could not as torment, be ministered to the body, no more than the fire tormented the king of Babylon's furnace (Dan 3).",Or than the king of Moab's lime kiln was afflicted because the king of Edom's bones were burnt therein.,"But now the body has received again its senses, now therefore it must, yea, it cannot choose but must feel that wrath of God that is let out, yea, poured out like floods of water into the soul.","27 Remember also, that besides what the body receiveth from the soul by reason of its union and sympathy therewith, there is a punishment, and instruments of punishment, though I will not pretend to tell you exactly what it is, prepared for the body for its joining with the soul in sin, therewith to be punished; a punishment, I say, that shall fall immediately upon the body, and that such an one as will most fitly suit with the nature of the body, as wrath and guilt do most fitly suit the nature of the soul.",(3.),"Add to these, the durable condition that the body in this state is now in with the soul.","Time was when the soul died, and the body lived, and the soul was tormented while the body slept and rested in the dust; but now these things are past; for at the day of judgment, as I said, these two shall be re-united, and that which once did separate them, be destroyed; then of necessity they must abide together, and, as together, abide the punishment prepared for them; and this will greaten the torment of the body.","Death was once the wages of sin, and a grievous curse; but might the damned meet with it in hell, they would count it a mercy, because it would separate soul and body, and not only so, but take away all sense from the body, and make it incapable of suffering torment; yea, I will add, and by that means give the soul some ease; for without doubt, as the torments of the soul extend themselves to the body, so the torments of the body extend themselves to the soul; nor can it be otherwise, because of union and sympathy.","But death, natural death, shall be destroyed, and there shall be no more natural death, no, not in hell (1 Cor 15:26).","And now it shall happen to men, as it hath done in less and inferior judgments.","They shall seek death, and desire to die, and death shall not be found by them (Job 3:21; Rev 9:6).",Thus therefore they must abide together; death that used to separate them asunder is now slain--1.,"Because it was an enemy in keeping Christ's body in the grave; and, 2.","Because a friend to carnal men in that, though it was a punishment in itself, yet while it lasted and had dominion over the body of the wicked, it hindered them of that great and just judgment which for sin was due unto them; and this is the third discovery of the manner and way of punishing of the body.","But, (4.)","There will then be such things to be seen and heard, which the eye and the ear--to say no more than has been said of the sense of feeling--will see and hear, that will greatly aggravate the punishment of the body in hell; for though the eye is the window, and the ear a door for the soul to look out at, and also to receive in by, yet whatever goeth in at the ear or the eye leaves influence upon the body, whether it be that which the soul delighteth in, or that which the soul abhorreth; for as the eye affecteth the heart, or soul (Lam 3:51) so the eye and ear, by hearing and beholding, doth ofttimes afflict the body.","'When I heard, my belly trembled--rottenness entered into my bones.'",(Hab 3:16).,"Now, I say, as the body after its resurrection, to damnation, to everlasting shame and contempt (Dan 12:2; John 5:29) will receive all its senses again, so it will have matter to exercise them upon, not only to the letting into the soul those aggravations which they by hearing, feeling, and seeing are capable to let in thither, but, I say, they will have matter and things to exercise themselves upon for the helping forward of the torment of the body.","Under temporal judgments of old, the body as well as the soul had no ease, day or night, and that not only by reason of what was felt, but by reason of what was heard and seen.","'In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even!","And at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning!'",(Deu 28:67).,1.,"'For the fear of thine heart, wherewith thou shalt fear;' 2.","'And for the sight of thine eyes, which thou shalt see.'","Nay, He tells them a little before, that they should be mad for the sight of their eyes which they should see (verse 34).",See!,"why, what shall they see?","Why, themselves in hell, with others like them; and this will be a torment to their body.","There is bodily torment, as I said, ministered to the body by the senses of the body.",What think you?,"If a man saw himself in prison, in irons, upon the ladder, with the rope about his neck, would not this be distress to the body, as well as to the mind?","To the body, doubtless.","Witness the heavy looks, the shaking legs, trembling knees, pale face, and beating and aching heart; 28 how much more, then, when men shall see themselves in the most dreadful place; it is a fearful place, doubtless, to all to behold themselves in that shall come thither (Luke 16:28).","Again; they shall see others there, and shall by them see themselves.","There is an art by which a man may make his neighbour look so ghastly, that he shall fright himself by looking on him, especially when he thinks of himself, that he is of the same show also.","It is said concerning men at the downfall of Babylon, that they shall be amazed one at another, for 'their faces shall be as flames' (Isa 13:8).","And what if one should say, that even as it is with a house set on fire within, where the flame ascends out at the chimneys, out at the windows, and the smoke out at every chink and crevice that it can find, so it will be with the damned in hell.","That soul will breathe hell fire and smoke, and coals will seem to hang upon its burning lips; yea, the face, eyes, and ears will seem all to be chimneys and vents for the flame and smoke of the burning which God by His breath hath kindled therein, and upon them, which will be beheld one in another, to the great torment and distress of each other.",What shall I say?,"Here will be seen devils, and here will be heard howlings and mournings; here will the soul see itself at an infinite distance from God; yea, the body will see it too.","In a word, who knows the power of God's wrath, the weight of sin, the torments of hell, and the length of eternity?","If none, then none can tell, when they have said what they can, the intolerableness of the torments that will swallow up the soul, the lost soul, when it is cast away by God, and from Him, into outer darkness for sin.",But this much for the cause of the loss of the soul.,"DOCTRINE SECOND, I now come to the second doctrine that I gathered from the words--namely, that how unconcerned and careless soever some now be about the loss or salvation of their souls, the day is coming, but it will then be too late, when men will be willing, had they never so much, to give it all in exchange for their souls.",There are four things in the words that do prove this doctrine.,1.,"There is an intimation of life and sense in the man that has lost, and that after he has lost, his soul in hell--'Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'","These words are by no means applicable to the man that has no life or sense; for he that is dead according to our common acceptation of death, that is, deprived of life and sense, would not give twopence to change his state; therefore the words do intimate that the man is yet alive and sensible.","Now were a man alive and sensible, though he was in none other place than the grave, there to be confined, while others are at liberty, what would he give in exchange for his place, and to be rid of that for a better!","but how much more to be delivered from hell, the present place and state of his soul!",2.,There is in the text an intimation of a sense of torment 'Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?',I am tormented in this flame.,"Torment, then, the soul is sensible of, and that there is a place of ease and peace.","And from the sense and feeling of torment, he would give, yea, what would he not give, in exchange for his soul?",3.,"There is in the text an intimation of the intolerableness of the torment, because that it supposeth that the man whose soul is swallowed up therewith would give all, were his all never so great, in exchange for his soul.",4.,"There is yet in the text an intimation that the soul is sensible of the lastingness of the punishment, or else the question rather argues a man unwary than considerate in his offering, as is supposed by Christ, so largely, his all in exchange for his soul.","But we will, in this manner, proceed no further, but take it for granted that the doctrine is good; wherefore I shall next inquire after what is contained in this truth.","And, FIRST, That God has undertaken, and will accomplish, the breaking of the spirits of all the world, either by His grace and mercy to salvation, or by His justice and severity to damnation.","The damned soul under consideration is certainly supposed, as by the doctrine, so by the text, to be utterly careless, and without regard of salvation, so long as the acceptable time did last, and as the white flag, that signifies terms of peace, did hang out; and, therefore, it is said to be lost; but, behold, now it is careful, but now it is solicitous, but now, 'what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'","He of whom you read in the gospel, that could tend to do nothing in the days of the gospel but to find out how to be clothed in purple and fine linen, and to fare sumptuously every day, was by God brought so down, and laid so low at last, that he could crouch, and cringe, and beg for one small drop of water to cool his tongue--a thing, that but a little before he would have thought scorn to have done, when he also thought scorn to stoop to the grace and mercy of the gospel (Luke 16:19,24).","But God was resolved to break his spirit, and the pride of his heart, and to humble his lofty looks, if not by His mercy, yet by His justice; if not by His grace, yet by hell fire.","This he also threatens to bring upon the fool in the Proverbs--'They shall call, they shall seek, they shall cry' (Prov 1:22-32).",Who shall do so?,"The answer is, They that sometimes scorned either to seek, or call, or cry; they that stopped their ears, that pulled away their shoulders, and that refused to seek, or call, or cry to God for mercy (Zech 7:11-13).","Sinner, careless sinner, didst thou take notice of this first inference that I have drawn from my second doctrine?","If thou didst, yet read it again: it is this, 'God has undertaken, and will accomplish, the breaking of the spirits of all the world, either by His grace and mercy unto salvation, or by His justice and severity to damnation.'","The reason for this is this: God is resolved to have the mastery, He is resolved to have the victory.",'Who would set the briers and thorns against Me in battle?,"I would go through them, I would burn them together' (Isa 27:4).",I will march against them.,"God is merciful, and is come forth into the world by His Son, tendering of grace unto sinners by the gospel, and would willingly make a conquest over them for their good by His mercy.","Now He being come out, sinners like briars and thorns do set themselves against Him, and will have none of His mercy.","Well, but what says God?","Saith He, Then I will march on, I will go through them, and burn them together.","I am resolved to have the mastery one way or another; if they will not bend to Me, and accept of My mercy in the gospel, I will bend them and break them by My justice in hell fire.","They say they will not bend; I say they shall; now they 'shall know whose words shall stand, Mine or theirs.'",(Jer 44:25-28).,"Wherefore the apostle, when he saw that some of the Corinthians began to be unruly, and to do those things that did begin to hazard them, saith, 'Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?",are we stronger than He?',(1 Cor 5:22).,"As who should say, My brethren, are you aware what you do?",do you not understand that God is resolved to have the mastery one way or another?,and are you stronger than He?,"if not, tremble before Him, or He will certainly have you under His feet--'I will tread them in Mine anger, and trample them in My fury' (Isa 63:3).",Thus He speaks of them that set themselves against Him; therefore beware.,"Now the reason of this resolution of God, it flows from a determination in Him to make all His sayings good, and to verify them on the consciences of sinners.","And since the incredulous world will not believe now, and fly from wrath, they shall shortly believe and cry under it; since they will not now credit the Word, before they see, unto salvation, they shall be made to credit it by sense and feeling unto damnation.","SECOND, The second inference that I draw from my second doctrine is this: 'That it is, and will be the lot of some to bow and break before God, too late, or when it is too late.'","God is resolved, as I said.","to have the mastery, and that not only in a way of dominion and lordship in general, for that He has now, but He is resolved to master, that is, to break the spirit of the world, to make all men cringe and crouch unto Him, even those that now say, 'There is no God,' (Psa 14:1); or if there be, yet, 'What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him?'",(Job 21:15; Mal 3:14).,"This is little thought of by those that now harden their hearts in wickedness, and that turn their spirit against God; but this they shall think of, this they must think of, this God will make them think of in that day, at which day they also now do mock and deride, that the Scripture might be fulfilled upon them (2 Peter 3:3,4).","And, I say, they shall think then of those things, and break at heart, and melt under the hand, and power, and majesty of the Almighty; for, 'As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me; and every tongue shall confess to God' (Isa 45:23; Rom 14:11).","And again, 'The nations shall see, and be confounded at all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.","They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms,' or creeping things, 'of the earth; they shall be afraid of the Lord our God, and shall fear because of Thee' (Micah 7:16,17).","For then they, will they nill they, shall have to do with God, though not with Him as merciful, or as one that may be intreated; yet with Him all just, and as devouring fire (Heb 7:29).","Yea, they shall see that face, and hear that voice, from whom and from which the heavens and the earth will fly away, and find no place of stay.","And by this appearance, and by such words of His mouth as He then will speak to them, they shall begin to tremble, and call for the rocks to fall upon them and cover them; for if these things will happen at the execution of inferior judgments, what will be done, what effects will the last, most dreadful, and eternal judgment, have upon men's souls?","Hence you find, that at the very first appearance of Jesus Christ, the whole world begins to mourn and lament--'Every eye shall see Him, and they also which pierced Him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him' (Rev 1:7).","And, therefore, you also find them to stand at the door and knock, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open unto us' (Luke 14:25; Matt 25:11).","Moreover, you find them also desiring, yea, also so humble in their desires as to be content with the least degree of mercy--one drop, one drop upon the tip of one's finger.","What stooping, what condescension, what humility is here!","All, and every one of those passages declare, that the hand of God is upon them, and that the Almighty has got the mastery of them, has conquered them, broke the pride of their power, and laid them low, and made them cringe and crouch unto him, bending the knee, and craving of kindness.","Thus, then, will God bow, and bend, and break them; yea, make them bow, and bend, and break before Him.","And hence also it is they will weep, and mourn, and gnash their teeth, and cry, and repent that ever they have been so foolish, so wicked, so traitorous to their souls, such enemies of their own eternal happiness, as to stand out in the day of their visitation in a way of rebellion against the Lord.","But here is their hard hap, their dismal lot and portion, that all these things must be when it is too late.","It is, and will be, the lot and hap of these to bow, bend, and break too late (Matt 25).","You read they come weeping and mourning, and with tears; they knock and they cry for mercy; but what did tears avail?","Why, nothing; for the door was shut.","He answered and said, 'I know not whence you are.'","But they repeat and renew their suit, saying, 'We have eaten and drunk in Thy presence, and Thou hast taught in our streets.'",What now?,"Why, He returns upon them His first answer the second time, saying, 'I know not whence ye are; depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity;' then He concludes, 'There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out' (Luke 13:26,28).","They come weeping, and go weeping away.","They come to Him weeping, for they saw that He had conquered them; but they departed weeping, for they saw that He would damn them; yet, as we read in another place, they were very loath to go from Him, by their reasoning and expostulating with Him--'Lord, when saw we Thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto Thee?'",But all would not do; here is no place for change of mind--'These shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into life eternal' (Matt 25:44-46).,And now what would a man give in exchange for his soul?,"So that, as I said before, all is too late; they mourn too late, they repent too late, they pray too late, and seek to make an exchange for their soul too late.",'Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?',"Two or three things there may yet be gathered from these words; I mean, as to the desires of them that have lost their souls, to make for them an exchange; 'What shall a man give in exchange?'","--what shall, what would, yea, what would not a man, if he had it, give in exchange for his soul?","First, What would not a man--I mean, a man that is in the condition that is by the text supposed some men are and will be in--give in exchange to have another man's virtue instead of their own vices?","'Let me die the death of the righteous;' let my soul be in the state of the soul of the righteous--that is, in reference to his virtues, when I die, 'and let my last end be like his' (Num 23:10).","It is a sport now to some to taunt, and squib, and deride at other men's virtues; but the day is coming when their minds will be changed, and when they shall be made to count those that have done those righteous actions and duties which they have scoffed at, the only blessed men; yea, they shall wish their soul in the blessed possession of those graces and virtues, that those whom they hated were accompanied with, and would, if they had it, give a whole world for this change; but it will not now do, it is now too late.",What then shall a man give in exchange for his soul?,"And this is more than intimated in that 25th of Matthew, named before: for you find by that text how loath they were, or will be, to be counted for unrighteous people--'Lord,' say they, 'when did we see thee an hungred, or athirst, naked, or sick, and did not minister unto thee?'","Now they are not willing to be of the number of the wicked, though hereto-fore the ways of the righteous were an abomination to them.","But, alas!","they are before a just God, a just Judge, a Judge that will give every one according to their ways; therefore, 'Woe unto (the soul of) the wicked now, it shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be given him' (Isa 3:11).","Thus, therefore, he is locked up as to this; he cannot now change his vice for virtues, nor put himself nor his soul in the stead of the soul of the saved; so that it still, and will, for ever abide a question unresolved,' Or, what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'","I do not doubt but that a man's state may be such in this world, that if he had it he would give thousands of gold to be as innocent and guiltless in the judgment of the law of the land as is the state of such or such, heartily wishing that himself was not that he, that he is; how much more then will men wish thus when they stand ready to receive the last, their eternal judgment.",'But what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?',"Second, As they would, for the salvation of their souls, be glad to change away their vices for the virtues, their sins for the good deeds of others; so what would they not give to change places now, or to remove from where now they are, into paradise, into Abraham's bosom!","But neither shall this be admitted; the righteous must have their inheritance to themselves--' Neither,' said Abraham, 'can they pass to us, that would come from thence,' (Luke 16:26); neither can they dwell in heaven that would come from hell.","They then that have lost, or shall lose their souls are bound to their place, as well as to their sins.","When Judas went to hell, he went to his home, 'to his own place' (Acts 1:25).","And when the righteous go hence, they also go home to their house, to their own place; for the kingdom of heaven is prepared for them (Matt 25:34).",Between heaven and hell 'there is a great gulf fixed' (Luke 26:26).,That is a strange passage: 'There is a great gulf fixed.',"What this gulf is, and how impassable, they that shall lose their souls will know to their woe; because it is fixed there where it is, on purpose to keep them in their tormenting place, so that they that would pass from hell to heaven cannot.","But, I say, 'Would they not change places?",would they not have a more comfortable house and home for their souls?',"Yes, verily, the text supposes it, and the 16th of Luke affirms it; yea, and could they purchase for their souls a habitation among the righteous, would they not?","Yes, they would give all the world to such a change.","What shall, what shall not, a man, if he had it, if it would answer his design, give in exchange for his soul?","Third, As the damned would change their own vices for virtues, and the place where they are for that into which they shall not come, so what would they give for a change of condition?","Yea, if an absolute change may not be obtained, yet what would they give for the least degree of mitigation of that torment, which now they know will without any intermission be, and that for ever and ever.","'Tribulation and anguish, indignation and wrath' (Rom 2:8,9), the gnawing worm, and everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power, cannot be borne but with great horror and grief (2 Thess 1:7-10).","No marvel, then, if these poor creatures would, for ease for their souls, be glad to change their conditions.",Change!--with whom?,"with an angel, with a saint; ay, with a dog or a toad; 29 for they mourn not, they weep not, nor do they bear indignation of wrath; they are as if they had not been; only the sinful soul abides in its sins, in the place designed for lost souls, and in the condition that wrath and indignation for sin and transgression hath decreed them to abide for ever.","And this brings me to the conclusion, which is, 'that seeing the ungodly do seek good things too late,' therefore, notwithstanding their seeking, they must still abide in their place, their sins, and their torment--'For what can a man give in exchange for his soul?'","Therefore, God saith, that they there must still abide and dwell, no exchange can be made.","'This shall ye have of Mine hand, ye shall lie down in sorrow;' they shall lie down in it, they shall make their bed there, there they shall lie (Isa 50:11; Eze 32:25-27).","And this is the bitter pill that they must swallow down at the last; for, after all their tears, their sorrows, their mournings, their repentings, their wishings and woundings, and all their inventings, and desires to change their state for a better, they must 'lie down in sorrow.'","The poor condemned man that is upon the ladder or scaffold has, if one knew them, many a long wish and long desire that he might come down again alive, or that his condition was as one of the spectators that are not condemned and brought thither to be executed as he.","How carefully also doth he look with his failing eyes, to see if some comes not from the king with a pardon for him, all the while endeavouring to fumble away as well as he can, and to prolong the minute of his execution!","But at last, when he has looked, when he has wished, when he has desired, and done whatever he can, the blow with the axe, or turn with the ladder, is his lot, so he goes off the scaffold, so he goes from among men; and thus it will be with those that we have under consideration; when all comes to all, and they have said, and wished, and done what they can, the judgment must not be reversed--they must 'lie down in sorrow.'","They must, or shall lie down!","Of old, when a man was to be chastised for his fault, he was to lie down to receive his stripes; so here, saith the Lord, they shall lie down--'And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face' (Deu 25:2).","And this lying down was to be his lot after he had pleaded for himself what be could--and the judge shall cause him to be beaten before his face, while he is present to behold the execution of judgment; and thus it shall be at the end of the world; the wicked shall lie down, and shall be beaten with many stripes in the presence of Christ, 'and in the presence of the holy angels' (2 Thess 1; Rev 14:10).","For there will be His presence, not only at the trial as Judge, but to see execution done, nay, to do it Himself by the pouring out, like a river, His wrath as burning brimstone upon the soul of the lost and cast away sinner.",He shall lie down!,"These words imply that, at last, the damned soul shall submit; for to lie down is an act that signifies submission, especially to lie down to be beaten.",'The wicked shall be silent in darkness' (1 Sam 2:9).,"When the malefactor has said and wished all that be can, yet at last he submits, is silent, and, as it were, helps to put his head into the halter, or doth lay down his neck upon the block; so here it is said of the damned--They shall lie down in sorrow.","There is also a place that saith, 'These shall go away into everlasting punishment' (Matt 25:46).","To go, to go to punishment, is also an act of submission.","Now, submission to punishment doth, or should, flow from full conviction of the merit of punishment; and I think it is so to be understood here--For 'every mouth shall be stopped, and all the world (of soul losers) become guilty before God' (Rom 3:4,19; Luke 13:25-28; Matt 25:46).","Every mouth shall be stopped, not at the beginning of the judgment, for then they plead, and pray, and also object against the Judge; but at the end, after that by a judicial proceeding He shall have justified against them His sayings, and have overcome these His judges, then they shall submit, and also lie down in s orrow; yea, they shall go away to their punishment as those who know they deserve it; yea, they shall go away with silence.","How they shall behave themselves in hell, I will not here dispute; whether in a way of rage and blasphemy, and in rending and tearing of the name and just actions of God towards them, or whether by way of submission there; I say, though this is none of this task, yet a word or two, if you please.","Doubtless they will not be mute there; they will cry and wail, and gnash their teeth, and, perhaps, too, sometimes at God; but I do not think but that the justice that they have deserved, and the equal administration of it upon them, will, for the most part, prevail with them to rend and tear themselves, to acquit and justify God, and to add fuel to their fire, by concluding themselves in all the fault, and that they have sufficiently merited this just damnation; for it would seem strange to me that just judgment among men shall terminate in this issue, if God should not justify himself in the conscience of all the damned.","But as here on earth, so He will let them know that go to hell that He hath not done without a cause, a sufficient cause, all that He hath done in damning of them (Eze 14:23).",[USE AND APPLICATION.],I come now to make some use and application of the whole.,"And, USE FIRST--If the soul be so excellent a thing as we have made it appear to be, and if the loss thereof be so great a loss, then here you may see who they are that are those extravagant ones; I mean, those that are such in the highest degree.","Solomon tells us of 'a great waster,' and saith also, that he that is slothful in his business is brother to such an one (Prov 18:9).","Who Solomon had his eye upon, or who it was that he counted so great a waster, I cannot tell; but I will challenge all the world to show me one, that for wasting and destroying, may be compared to him that for the lusts and pleasures of this life will hazard the loss of his soul.","Many men will be so profuse, and will spend at that prodigal rate, that they will bring a thousand pound a year to five hundred, and five hundred to fifty, and some also will bring that fifty to less than ninepence; 30 but what is this to him that shall never leave losing until he has lost his soul?","I have heard of some who would throw away a farm, a good estate, upon the trundling of one single bowl;31 but what is this to the casting away of the soul?","Nothing can for badness be compared to sin; it is the vile thing, it cannot have a worse name than its own; it is worse than the vilest men, than the vilest of beasts; yea, sin is worse than the devil himself, for it is sin, and sin only, that hath made the devils devils; and yet for this, for this vile, this abominable thing, some men, yea, most men, will venture the loss of their soul; yea, they will mortgage, pawn, and set their souls to sale for it (Jer 44:4).",Is not this a great waster?,doth not this man deserve to be ranked among the extravagant ones?,"What think you of him who, when he tempted the wench to uncleanness, said to her, If thou wilt venture thy body, I'll venture my soul?","Was not here like to be a fine bargain, think you?",or was not this man like to be a gainer by so doing?,"This is he that prizes sin at a higher rate than he doth his immortal soul; yea, this is he that esteems a quarter of an hour's pleasure more than he fears everlasting d amnation.",What shall I say?,"This man is minded to give more to be damned, than God requires he should give to be saved; is not this an extravagant one?","'Be astonished, O ye heavens!","at this, and be horribly afraid!'",(Jer 2:9-12).,"Yea, let all the angels stand amazed at the unaccountable prodigality of such an one.",Objection 1.,"But some may say, I cannot believe that God will be so severe as to cast away into hell fire an immortal soul for a little sin.",Answer.,"I know thou canst not believe it, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst sooner eat fire than run this hazard; and hence all they that go down to the lake of fire are called the unbelievers; and the Lord shall cut thee, that makest this objection, asunder, and shall appoint thee thy portion with such, except thou believe the gospel, and repent (Luke 12:46).",Objection 2.,"But surely, though God should be so angry at the beginning, it cannot in time but grieve Him to see and hear souls roaring in hell, and that for a little sin.",Answer.,"Whatsoever God doeth, it abideth for ever (Eccl 3:14).","He doth nothing in a passion, or in an angry fit; He proceedeth with sinners by the most perfect rules of justice; wherefore it would be injustice, to deliver them whom the law condemneth, yea, He would falsify His word, if after a time He should deliver them from hell, concerning whom He hath solemnly testified, that they shall be there for ever.",Objection 3.,"O but, as He is just, so He is merciful; and mercy is pitiful, and very compassionate to the afflicted.",Answer.,"O, but mercy abused becomes most fearful in tormenting.","Did you never read that the Lamb turned lion, and that the world will tremble at the wrath of the Lamb, and be afflicted more at the thoughts of that, than at the thoughts of anything that shall happen to them in the day when God shall call them to an account for their sins?","(Rev 6:16,17).","The time of mercy will be then past, for now is that acceptable time, behold now is the day of salvation; the gate of mercy will then be shut, and must not be opened again; for now is that gate open, now it is open for a door of hope (2 Cor 6:2; Matt 25:10; Luke 13:25).","The time of showing pity and compassion will then be at an end; for that as to acting towards sinners will last but till the glass of the world is run, and when that day is past, mark what God saith shall follow, 'I will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you' (Prov 1:26,27).","Mark you how many pinching expressions the Lord Jesus Christ doth threaten the refusing sinner with;

I come now to the second use.,USE SECOND.--Is it so?,"Is the soul such an excellent thing, and the loss thereof so unspeakably great?","Then here you may see who are the greatest fools in the world--to wit, those who, to get the world and its preferments, will neglect God till they lose their souls.","The rich man in the gospel was one of these great fools, for that he was more concerned about what he should do with his goods, than how his soul should be saved (Luke 7:16-21).","Some are for venturing their souls for pleasures, and some are for venturing their souls for profits; they that venture their souls for pleasures have but little excuse for their doings; but they that venture their soul for profit seem to have much.",'And they all with one consent began to make excuse;'--excuse for what?,"why, for the neglect of the salvation of their souls.",But what was the cause of their making this excuse?,"Why, their profits came tumbling in.","'I have bought a piece of ground;' 'I have bought five yoke of oxen;' and 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come' (Luke 14:15-20).","Thus also it was with the fool first mentioned; his ground did bring forth plentifully, wherefore he must of necessity forget his soul, and, as he thought, all the reason of the world he should.","Wherefore, he falls to crying out, What shall I do?","Now, had one said, Mind the good of thy soul, man; the answer would have been ready, But where shall I bestow my goods.","If it had been replied, Stay till harvest; he returns again, But I have no room where to bestow my goods.","Now, tell him of praying, and he answers, he must go to building.","Tell him, he should frequent sermons, and he replies, he must mind his workmen.","'He cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?'",(Isa 44:20).,"And see if, in the end, he did not become a fool; for though he accomplished the building of his barns, and put in there all his fruits and his goods, yet even till now his soul was empty, and void of all that was good; nor did he, in singing of that requiem which he sung to his soul at last, saying, 'Soul, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry,' show himself ever the wiser; for, in all his labours he had rejected to get that food that indeed is meat and drink for the soul.","Nay, in singing this song he did but provoke God to hasten to send to fetch his soul to hell; for so begins the conclusion of the parable--'Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?'","So that, I say, it is the greatest folly in the world for a man, upon any pretence what ever, to neglect to make good the salvation of his soul.","There are six signs of a fool, and they do all meet in that same man that concerns not himself, and that to good purpose, for the salvation of his soul.",1.,"A fool has not an heart, when the price is in his hand, to get wisdom.",(Prov 17:16).,2.,'It is a sport to a fool to do mischief.',and to set light by the commission of sin (Prov 10:23).,3.,"'Fools despise wisdom;' 'fools hate knowledge' (Prov 1:7,22).",4.,"'A fool,' after restraint, 'returneth to his folly' (Prov 26:11).",5.,'The way of a fool is right in his own eyes' (Prov 7:15).,6.,The fool goes merrily 'to the correction of the stocks' (Prov 7:22).,"I might add many more, but these six shall suffice at this time, by which it appears that the fool has no heart for the heavenly prize, yet he has to sport himself in sin; and when he despises wisdom, the way is yet right before him; yea, if he be for some time restrained from vice, he greedily turneth again thereto, and will, when he has finished his course of folly and sin in this world, go as heedlessly, as carelessly, as unconcernedly, and quietly, down the steps to hell, as the ox goeth to the slaughter-house, This is a soul fool, a fool of the biggest size; and so is every one also that layeth up treasure for himself on earth, 'and is not rich towards God' (Luke 7:21).",Objection 1.,But would you not have us mind our worldly concerns?,Answer.,"Mind them, but mind them in their place; mind thy soul first and most; the soul is more than the body, and eternal life better than temporal; first seek the kingdom of God, and prosper in thy health and thy estate as thy soul prospers (Matt 6:33; 3 John 2).","But as it is rare to see this command obeyed, for the kingdom of God shall be thought of last, so if John's wish was to light upon, or happen to some people, they would neither have health nor wealth in this world.","To prosper and be in health, as their soul prospers--what, to thrive and mend in outwards no faster?","then we should have them have consumptive bodies and low estates;

Matt 5:4; Heb10:39).,Objection 3.,"But the most of men do that which you forbid, and why may not we?",Answer.,"God says, 'Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil' (Exo 23:2).","It is not what men do, but what God commands; it is not what doth present itself unto us, but what is best, that we should choose (Matt 6:23; Luke 10:41,42).","Now, 'He that refuseth instruction, despiseth his own soul;' and 'He that keepeth the commandment, keepeth his own soul' (Prov 15:32; 19:16).","Make not, therefore, these foolish objections.",But what saith the Word?,how readest thou?,"That tells thee, that the pleasures of sin are but for a season; that the things that are seen are but temporal;

Luke 16:13).,"'If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,' (1 John 2:15); and yet this objection bespeaks that thy heart is divided, that thou art a Mammonist, or that thou lovest the world.",But will riches profit in the day of wrath?,(Prov 11:4).,"Yea, are they not hurtful in the day of grace?","do they not tend to surfeit the heart, and to alienate a man and his mind from the things that are better?",(Luke 21:34).,"Why, then, wilt thou set thy heart upon that which is not?","yea, then what will become of them that are so far off of minding of their souls, that they, for whole months, and years together, scarce consider whether they have souls to save?","USE THIRD.--But, thirdly, is it so?","Is the soul such an excellent thing, and is the loss thereof so unspeakably great?",Then this should teach people to be very careful to whom they commit the teaching and guidance of their souls.,"This is a business of the greatest concern; men will be careful to whom they commit their children, who they make the executors of their will, in whose hand they trust the writing and evidences of their lands; but how much more careful should we be, and yet the most are the least of all careful, unto whom they commit the teaching and guidance of their souls.",There are several sorts of soul shepherds in the world: 1.,There are idol shepherds (Zech 6:5).,2.,There are foolish shepherds (Zech 11:15).,3.,"There are shepherds that feed themselves, and not their flock (Eze 34:2) 4.",There are hard-hearted and pitiless shepherds (Zech 9: 3).,5.,"There are shepherds that, instead of healing, smite, push, and wound the diseased (Eze 34:4,21).",6.,There are shepherds that 'cause their flocks to go astray' (Jer 50:6).,7.,And there are shepherds that feed their flock; these are the shepherds to whom thou shouldst commit thy soul for teaching and for guidance.,Question.,"You may ask, How should I know those shepherds?",Answer.,"First, surrender up thy soul unto God, by Christ, and choose Christ to be the chief Shepherd of thy soul; and He will direct thee to His shepherds, and He will, of His mercy, set such shepherds over thee 'as shall feed thee with knowledge and understanding' (1 Peter 2:25; 4:19; John 10:4,5; Song 1:7, 8; Jer 3:15; 23:4).","Before thou hast surrendered up thy soul to Christ, that He may be thy chief Shepherd, thou canst not find out, nor choose to put thy soul under the teaching and guidance of His under shepherds, for thou canst not love them; besides, they are so set forth by false shepherds, in so many ugly guises, and under so many false and scandalous dresses, that, should I direct thee to them while thou art a stranger to Christ, thou wilt count them deceivers, devourers, and wolves in sheeps' clothing, rather than the shepherds that belong to the great and chief Shepherd, who is, also, the Bishop of the soul.","Yet this I will say unto thee, take heed of that shepherd that careth not for his own soul, that walketh in ways, and doth such things, as have a direct tendency to damn his own soul; I say, take heed of such an one, come not near him, let him have nothing to do with thy soul; for if he be not faithful to that which be his own soul, be sure he will not be faithful to that which is another man's.","He that feeds his own soul with ashes, will scarce feed thine with the bread of life; wherefore, take heed of such an one; and many such there are in the world (Isa 44:20).","'By their fruits you shall know them;' they are for flattering of the worst, and frowning upon the best; they are for promising of life to the profane, and for slaying the souls that God would have live; they are also men that hunt souls that fear God, but for sewing pillows under those arm holes which God would have to lean upon that which would afflict them.","These be them 'that, with lies, do make the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad;' saith God; and that have 'strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he shall not return from his wicked way, by promising of him life' (Eze 13:18-22).","And as thou shouldest, for thy soul's sake, choose for thyself good soul shepherds, so also, for the same reason, you should choose for yourself a good wife, a good husband, a good master, a good servant; for in all these things the soul is concerned.","Abraham would not suffer Isaac to take a wife of the daughters of Canaan, (Gen 24:3); nor would David suffer a wicked servant to come into his house, or to tarry in his sight (Psa 101:7).","Bad company is, also, very destructive to the soul, and so is evil communication; wherefore, be diligent to shun all these things, that thou mayest persevere in that way, the end of which will be the saving of thy soul (Prov 13:20; 1 Cor 15:33).","And since, under this head, I am fallen upon cautions, let me add these to those which I have presented to thee already: Caution 1.","Take heed, take heed of learning to do evil of any that are good.",'Tis possible for a good man to do things that are bad; but let not his bad action embolden thee to run upon sin.,"Seest thou a good man that stumbleth at a stone, or that slippeth into the dirt--let that warn thee to take heed; let his stumble make thee wary, let his fall make thee look well to thy goings; 'ever follow that which is good' (1 Thess 5:15).",Thy soul is at stake.,Caution 2.,"Take heed of the good things of bad men, for in them there lies a snare also; their 'good words and fair speeches' tend to deceive (Rom 16:17, 18).","Learn to be good, by the Word of God and by the holy lives of them that be good; envy not the wicked, 'nor desire to be with them;' 'choose none of his ways' (Prov 3:31; 24:1).",Thy soul lies at stake.,Caution 3.,Take heed of playing the hypocrite in religion.,"What of God and His Word thou knowest, profess it honestly, conform to it heartily, serve Him faithfully; for what is the hypocrite bettered by all his profession, 'when God taketh away his soul?'",(Job 27:8).,Caution 4.,"Take heed of delays to turn to God, and of choosing His ways for the delight of thy heart, 'for the Lord's eye is upon them that fear Him, to deliver their souls' (Psa 33:18,19).",Caution 5.,"Boast not thyself of thy flocks and thy herds, of thy gold and thy silver, of thy sons and of thy daughters.","What is a house full of treasures, and all the delights of this world, if thou be empty of grace, 'if thy soul be not filled with good?'",(Eccl 6:3).,"But, USE FOURTH.--Is it so?","Is the soul such an excellent thing, and is the loss thereof so unspeakably great?","Then, I pray thee, let me inquire a little of thee, what provision thou hast made for thy soul?","There be many that, through their eagerness after the things of this life, do bereave their soul of good, even of that good the which if they had it would be a good to them for ever (Eccl 4:8).","But I ask not concerning this; it is not what provision thou hast made for this life, but what for the life, and the world to come.","'Lord, gather not my soul with sinners,' saith David, (Psa 26:9); not with men of this world: Lord, not with them that have their portion in this life, whose belly Thou fillest with Thy hid treasures.","Thus you see how Solomon laments some, and how his father prays to be delivered from their lot who have their portion in this life, and that have not made provision for their soul.","Well, then, let me inquire of thee about this matter.",What provision hast thou made for thy soul?,"And, 1.",What hast thou thought of thy soul?,What ponderous thoughts hast thou had of the greatness and of the immortality of thy soul?,"This must be the first inquiry: for he that hath not had his thoughts truly exercised, ponderously exercised, about the greatness and the immortality of his soul, will not be careful, after an effectual manner, to make provision for his soul, for the life and world to come.","The soul is a man's all, whether he knows it or no, as I have already showed you.",Now a man will be concerned about what he thinks is his all.,"We read of the poor servant that 'setteth his heart upon' his wages (Deu 24:14,15).","But it is because it is his all, his treasure, and that wherein his worldly worth lieth.","Why, thy soul is thy all;

either thou hast very great and weighty thoughts about the excellent greatness of thy soul, or else thou dost not count that thy soul is so great a thing as it is, else thou dost not count it thy all.",2.,What judgment hast thou made of the present state of thy soul?,I speak now to the unconverted.,"Thy soul is under sin, under the curse, and an object of wrath; this is that sentence that by the Word is passed upon it--'Woe unto their soul,' saith God, 'for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.'",(Isa 3:9).,This is the sentence of God.,"Well, but what judgment hast thou passed upon it while thou livest in thy debaucheries?","Is it not that which thy fellows have passed on theirs before thee, saying, 'I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst' (Deu 29:19).","If so, know thy judgment is gross, thy soul is miserable, and turn, or in little time thine eyes will behold all this.",3.,"What care hast thou had of securing of thy soul, and that it might be delivered from the danger that by sin it is brought into?","if a man has a horse, a cow, or a swine that is sick, or in danger by reason of this or that casualty, he will take care for his beast, that it may not perish; he will pull it out of the ditch on the Sabbath day.","But, oh!",that is the day on which many men do put their soul into the ditch of sin; that is the day that they set apart to pursue wickedness in.,"32 But, I say, what care hast thou taken to get thy soul out of this ditch?--a ditch out of which thou canst never get it without the aid of an omnipotent arm.","In things pertaining to this life, when a man feels his own strength fail, he will implore the help and aid of another; and no man can, by any means, deliver by his own arm his soul from the power of hell, which thou also wilt confess, if thou beest not a very brute; but what hast thou done with God for help?",hast thou cried?,hast thou cried out?,"yea, dost thou still cry out, and that day and night before him--'Deliver my soul' (Psa 17:13) 'Save my soul, preserve my soul' (Psa 25:20) 'Heal my soul,' (Psa 42:4), and, 'I pour out my soul unto thee?'",(Psa 62:5).,"Yea, canst thou say, My soul, my soul waiteth upon God, my soul thirsteth for Him, my soul followeth hard after him?","(Psa 63:1,8).","I say, dost thou this, or dost thou hunt thine own soul to destroy it?","The soul, with some, is the game, their lusts are the dogs, and they themselves are the huntsmen, and never do they more halloo, and lure, and laugh, and sing, than when they have delivered up their soul, their darling, to these dogs--a thing that David trembled to think of, when he cried, 'Dogs have compassed me.","Deliver my darling,' my soul, 'from the power of the dog' (Psa 22:16,20).","Thus, I say, he cried, and yet these dogs were but wicked men.","But, oh!","how much is a sin, a lust, worst than a man to do us hurt;

for the best of saints have their weaknesses, these their weaknesses.","The ladies as well as she that grinds at the mill, know what doth attend that sex; and the giants in grace as well as the weak and shrubs, are sensible of the same things, which thou layest in against thy exercising of hope, or as matter of thy discouragement.","Poor David says (Psa 77:2) 'My soul refused to be comforted,' upon this very account, and Paul cries out under sense of this, 'O wretched man that I am!'","and comes as it were to the borders of doubt, saying, 'Who shall deliver me?'",(Rom 7:24).,"Only he was quick at remembering that Christ was his righteousness and price of redemption, and there he relieved himself.","Again; this should drive us to faith in Christ; for therefore are the corruptions by Divine permission still left in us; they are not left in us to drive us to unbelief, but to faith--that is, to look to the perfect righteousness of Christ for life.","And for further help, consider, that therefore Christ liveth in heaven, making intercession, that thou mightest be saved by His life, not by thine, and by His intercessions, not by thy perfections (Rom 5: 6-9; Col 1:20).","Let not therefore thy weaknesses be thy discouragements; only let them put thee upon the duties required of thee by the gospel--to wit, faith, hope, repentance, humility, watchfulness, diligence, etc.",(1 Peter 1:13; 5:5; 2 Cor 7:11; Mark 13:37; 2 Peter 1:10).,Objection 3.,"But I find, together with these things, weakness and faintness as to my graces; my faith my hope, my love, and desires to these and all other Christian duties are weak;

but alas!",what is this to the loss about which we have been speaking all this while?,"The loss of an estate may be repaired, or if not, a man may find friends in his present deplorable condition to his support, though not recovery; but far will this be from him that shall lose his soul.",Ah!,"he has lost his soul, and can never be recovered again, unless hell fire can comfort him; unless he can solace himself in the fiery indignation of God; terrors will be upon him, anguish and sorrow will swallow him up, because of present misery; slighted and set at nought by God and His angels, he will also be in this miserable state, and this will add to sorrow, sorrow, and to his vexation of spirit, howling.","To present you with emblems of tormented spirits, or to draw before your eyes the picture of hell, are things too light for so ponderous a subject as this; nor can any man frame or invent words, be they never so deep and profound, sufficient to the life to set out the torments of hell.","All those expressions of fire, brimstone, the lake of fire, a fiery furnace, the bottomless pit, and a hundred more to boot, are all too short to let forth the miseries of those that shall be damned souls.",'Who knoweth the power or God's anger?',(Psa 90:11).,"None at all; and unless the power of that can be known, it must abide as unspeakable as the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.","We hear it thunder, we see it lighten; yea, eclipses, comets, and blazing stars are all subject to smite us with terror;

and he that goes down to hell shall hear groans that are unutterable.","Hear, did I say?","they shall feel them, they shall feel them burst from their wounded spirit as thunderclaps do from the clouds.","Once I dreamed that I saw two (whom I knew) in hell, and methought I saw a continual dropping from heaven, as of great drops of fire lighting upon them, to their sore distress.",Oh!,"words are wanting, thoughts are wanting, imagination and fancy are poor things here; hell is another kind of place and state than any alive can think; and since I am upon this subject, I will here treat a little of hell as the Scriptures will give me leave, and the rather because I am upon a use of terror, and because hell is the place of torment (Luke 16).",1.,"Hell is said to be beneath, as heaven is said to be above; because as above signifieth the utmost joy, triumph, and felicity, so beneath is a term most fit to describe the place of hell by, because of the utmost opposition that is between these two; hell being the place of the utmost sorrow, despair, and misery; there are the underlings ever trampled under the feet of God; they are beneath, below, under (Prov 15:24)!",2.,"Hell is said to be darkness, and heaven is said to be light; light, to show the pleasureableness and the desireableness of heaven; and darkness, to show the dolesome and wearisomeness of hell; and how weary, oh!","how weary and wearisomely, as I may say, will damned souls turn themselves from side to side, from place to place, in hell, while swallowed up in the thickest darkness, and griped with the burning thoughts of the endlessness of that most unutterable misery (Matt 22:13)!",3.,"Men are said to go up to heaven, but they are said to go down to hell; up, because of exaltation, and because they must abound in beauty and glory that go to heaven; down, because of those sad dejections, that great deformity and vile contempt that sin hath brought them to that go to hell (Eze 32:18).",4.,"Heaven is called a hill or mount, (Heb 12); hell is called a pit, or hole, (Rev 9:2); heaven, a mount, the mount Zion, (Rev 14); to show how God has, and will exalt them that loved Him in the world; hell, a pit or hole, to show how all the ungodly shall be buried in the yawning paunch and belly of hell, as in a hollow cave.",5.,Heaven!,"It is said of heaven, the height of heaven, (Job 22:12).","and of hell, the bottomless pit, (Rev 9:2; 20:3).","The height of heaven, to show that the exaltation of them that do ascend up thither is both perfect and unsearchable; and hell, the bottomless pit, to show that the downfall of them that descend in thither will never be at an end--down, down, down they go, and nothing but down, down still!",6.,Heaven!,"It is called the paradise of God, (Rev 2:7); but hell, the burning lake (Rev 20:15).","A paradise, to show how quiet, harmless, sweet, and beautiful heaven shall be to them that possess it, as the garden was at the beginning of the creation; hell, the burning lake, to allude to Sodom, that since its destruction is turned into a stinking lake, and to show that as their distress was unutterable, and to the highest amazement, full of confusion and horror, when that tempestuous storm of fire and brimstone was rained from the Lord out of heaven upon them, so, to the utmost degree, shall it be with the souls that are lost and cast into hell.",7.,"It is said that there are dwelling houses, or places in the kingdom of heaven (John 14: 1-3; Zech 3:7; Isa 57:1,2).",And also that there are the cells or the chambers of death in hell (Prov 7:27).,"There are mansions or dwelling places in heaven, to show that every one of them that go thither might have his reward, according to his work; and that there is hell, and the lowest hell (Deu 32:22; Psa 86:13).","And the chambers of death in hell to show there are places and states in hell too, for sinners to be imprisoned in, according to their faults; hence it is said of some, These shall receive greater damnation, (Luke 20:47); and of others, That it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the judgment than for them, etc.","(Luke 10:12, 14).",The lowest hell.,"How many hells there are above that, or more tolerable tormenting places than the most exquisite torments there, God, and they that are there, know best; but degrees without doubt there are; and the term 'lowest' shows the utmost and most exquisite distress; so the chambers of death, the second death in hell, for so I think the words should be understood--'Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death' (Prov 7:27).","These are the chambers that the chambers in the temple, or that the dwelling places in the house in heaven, are opposed to: and this opposition shows, that as there will be degrees of glory in heaven, so there will of torments in hell; and there is all reason for it, since the punishment must be inflicted by God, the infinitely just.","Why should a poor, silly, ignorant man, though damned, be punished with the same degree of torment that he that has lived a thousand times worse shall be punished with?","It cannot be; justice will not admit it; guilt, and the quality of the transgression, will not admit it; yea, the tormenting fire of hell itself will not admit it; for if hell fire can kindle upon nothing but sin, and the sinner for the sake of it, and if sin be as oil to that fire, as the Holy Ghost seems to intimate, saying, 'Let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones' (Psa 109:18).","Then as the quantity of the oil is, so will the fire burn, and so will the flaming flame ascend, and the smoke of their torment, for ever and ever.","Suppose a piece of timber a little bedaubed with oil, and another that has been soaking in it many a year, which of these two, think you, would burn fiercest?","and from whence would the flaming flame ascend highest, and make the most roaring noise?","Suppose two vessels filled with oil, one containing the quantity of a pint, the other containing the quantity of a hogshead, and suppose that in one place they were both set on fire, yet so that they might not intermix flames; nay, though they did, yet all would conclude that the most amazing roaring flame would be upon the biggest vessel, and would be the effect of the greatest quantity of oil; so it will be with the wicked in hell.","The lowest hell is for the biggest sinners, and theirs will be the greater damnation, and the more intolerable torment, though he that has least of this oil of sin in his bones, and of the kindlings of hell fire upon him, will find he has hell enough, and will be weary enough thereof, for still he must struggle with flames that are everlasting; for sin is such a thing, that it can never be burned out of the soul and body of a damned sinner.","But again; having treated thus of hell, we will now speak a word or two of sin, for that is it upon which hell fire seizes, and so on the soul by that.",Sin!,it is the sting of hell--the sting of death is sin (1 Cor 15:56).,"By 'death' in this place we must not understand that which is natural, but that which is in hell, the second death, even everlasting damnation; for natural death the saints die, yea, and also many sinners, without the least touch of a sting from that; but here is a death that has a sting to hurt, to twinge, and wound the sinner with, even then when it has the utmost mastery of him.","And this is the death that the saved are delivered from; not that which is natural, for that is the end of them as of others (1 Cor 15:55; Eccl 2:15, 16).","But the second death, the death in hell, for that is the portion of the damned, and it is from that that the saints have a promise of deliverance--'He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death' (Rev 2:11).","And again, 'Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection; on such the second death hath no power' (Rev 20:6).","It is this death, then, that hath the chambers to hold each damned soul in: and sin is the twining, winding, biting, poisoning sting of this death, or of these chambers of hell, for sinners to be stricken, stung, and pierced with.",'The sting of death is sin.',"Sin, the general of it, 37 is the sting of hell, for there would be no such thing as torment even there, were it not that sin is there with sinners; for, as I have hinted already, the fire of hell, the indignation and wrath of God, can fasten and kindle upon nothing but for or because of sin; sin, then, as sin, is the sting and the hell of hells, of the lowest and upmost hells.","Sin, I say, in the nature of it, simply as it is concluded both by God and the damned to be a breach of His holy law, so it is the sting of the second death, which is the worm of hell.","But then, as sin is such a sting in itself, so it is heightened, sharpened, and made more keen and sharp by those circumstances that as concomitants attend it in every act: for there is not a sin at any time committed by man, but there is some circumstance or other attends it, that makes it, when charged home by God's law, bigger and sharper, and more venom and poisonous to the soul than if it could be committed without them; and this is the sting of the hornet, the great sting.","I sinned without a cause to please a base lust, to gratify the devil; here is the sting!","Again, I preferred sin before holiness, death before life, hell before heaven, the devil before God, and damnation before a Saviour; here is the sting!","Again, I preferred moments before everlastings, temporals before eternals, to be racked and always slaying before the life that is blessed and endless; here is the sting!","Also, this I did against light, against convictions, against conscience, against persuasion of friends, ministers, and the godly lives which I beheld in others; here is the sting!","Also, this I did against warnings, forewarnings, yea, though I saw others fall before my face by the mighty hand of God for committing of the same; here is the sting!","Sinners, would I could persuade you to hear me out!","A man cannot commit a sin, but, by the commission of it, he doth, by some circumstance or other, sharpen the sting of hell, and that to pierce himself through and through, and through, with many sorrows (1 Tim 6:10) Also, the sting of hell to some will be, that the damnation of others stand upon their score, for that by imitating of them, by being deluded by them, persuaded by them, drawn in by them, they perish in hell for ever; and hence it is that these principal sinners must die all these deaths in themselves, that those damned ones that they have drawn into hell are also to bear in their own souls for ever.","And this God threatened to the prince of Tyrus, that capital sinner, because by his pride, power, practice, and policy, he cast down others into the pit; therefore saith God to him, 'They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.'","And again; 'Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God' (Eze 28:8,10).",Ah!,"this will be the sting of them, of those that are principal, chief and, as I may call them, the captain and ringleading sinners.","Vipers will come out of other men's fire and flames, and settle upon, seize upon, and for ever abide upon their consciences; and this will be the sting of hell, the great sting of hell to them.","I will yet add to all this; how will the fairness of some for heaven, even the thoughts of that, sting them when they come to hell!","It will not be so much their fall into the pit, as from whence they fell into it, that will be to them the buzzing noise and sharpened sting of the great and terrible hornet.","'How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer!'",there is the sting (Isa 14:12).,"Thou that art exalted up to heaven shalt be thrust down to hell, though thou hast made 'thy nest among the stars,' from thence I will fetch thee down; there is a sting (Matt 11:23; Oba 4).","To be pulled, for and through love to some vain lust, from the everlasting gates of glory, and caused to be swallowed up for it in the belly of hell, and made to lodge for ever in the darksome chambers of death, there is the piercing sting!","But again, as there is the sting of hell, so there is the strength of that sting; for a sting though never so sharp, or venom, yet if it wanteth strength to force it to the designed execution, it doth but little hurt.",But this sting has strength to cause it to pierce into the soul; 'the sting of death is sin: and the strength of sin is the law' (1 Cor 15:56).,"Here then is the strength of the stings of hell; it is the law in the perfect penalty of it; 'for without the law, sin is dead' (Rom 7:8).","Yea, again he saith, 'where no law is, there is no transgression' (Rom 4:15).","The law then followeth, in the executive part of it, the soul into hell, and there strengtheneth sin, that sting of hell, to pierce by its unutterable charging of it on the conscience, the soul for ever and ever; nor can the soul justly murmur or repine at God or at His law, for that then the sharply apprehensive soul will well discern the justness, righteousness, reasonableness, and goodness of the law, and that nothing is done by the law unto it, but that which is just and equal.","38 This, therefore, will put great strength and force into sin to sting the soul, and to strike it with the lashes of a scorpion.","Add yet to these the abiding life of God, the Judge and God of this law, will never die.","When princes die, the law may be altered by the which at present transgressors are bound in chains; but oh!","here is also that which will make this sting so sharp and keen, the God that executes it will never die.","'It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God' (Heb 10:30, 31).","FOOTNOTES: 1 'Gospellers,' a term of reproach given to our reformers under Henry VIII;

but in an edition by John Marshall, 1725, it became most seriously mutilated, many passages were omitted, and numerous errors were made.","In this state, it was copied into Mr. Whitefield's edition of his works, and it has been since republished with all those errors.",It is now restored to its original state; and we hope that it will prove a most acceptable addition to our theological literature.,"Although Bunyan was shut up for more than twelve years a prisoner for the truth, and his time was so fully occupied in preaching, writing, and labouring to provide for the pressing wants of his family; still he managed to get acquainted, in a very remarkable manner, with all those law terms which are connected with the duties of a counsel, or advocate.","He uses the words replevin, supersedeas, term, demur, nonsuit, reference, title, in forma pauperis, king's bench, common pleas, as properly and familiarly as if he had been brought up to the bar.","How extraordinary must have been his mental powers, and how retentive his memory!","I examined this work with apprehension, lest he had misapplied those hard words; but my surprise was great, to find that he had used every one of them with as much propriety as a Lord Chief-Justice could have done.","We are indebted for this treatise to Bunyan's having heard a sermon which excited his attention to a common, a dangerous, and a fatal heresy, more frequently preached to crowned heads, mitred prelates, members of parliament, and convocations, than it is to the poor, to whom the gospel is preached.","In this sermon, the preacher said to his hearers, ""see that your cause be good, else Christ will not undertake it.""",p. 159.,"Bunyan heard, as all Christians ought to hear, with careful jealousy, and at once detected the error.","He exposes the fallacy, and uses his scriptural knowledge to confute it, by showing that Christ pleads for the wicked, the lost; for those who feel themselves so involved in a bad cause, that no advocate but Christ can bring them through.",He manifests great anxiety that every inquirer should clearly ascertain definite truths and not be contented with general notions.,"See p. 189-199, and 201.","This is very important advice, and by following which, we shall be saved from many painful doubts and fears.","Our need of an advocate is proved by the fact, that Christ has undertaken the office.","Some rely on their tears and sighs, as advocates for them with God; others on imperfect good works-from all these the soul must be shaken, until it finds that there is no prevailing Advocate but the Saviour; and that he alone, with his mystical body, the church, is entitled to the inheritance.","Then sincere repentance, sighs, and tears, evidence our faith in him, and our godly sorrow for having occasioned him such inconceivable sufferings; tears of joy that we have such a Saviour and an Advocate, equally omnipotent to plead for, as to save us.","The inheritance being Christ's, the members of his body cannot be cheated of it, or alienate it.",p. 187.,"Bunyan, with his fertile imagination, and profound scriptural knowledge, spiritualizes the day of jubilee as a type of the safety of the inheritance of the saints.",By our folly and sin we may lose sight for a time of our title deeds; but the inheritance is safe.,"The whole work is a rich treat to those who love experimental divinity, and are safe in Christ as Noah was in the ark; but, Oh!","how woeful must those be, who are without an interest in the Saviour; and that have none to plead their cause.","""They are left to be ground to powder between the justice of God and the sins which they have committed.",It is sad to consider their plight.,"This is the man that is pursued by the law, and by sin, and by death, and has none to plead his cause.","Terrors take hold on him as waters; a stone hurleth him out of his place"" (Job 27).",p. 200.,"Reader, this is a soul-searching subject-may it lead us to a solemn trial of our state, and to the happy conclusion, that the Saviour is our Advocate, and that our eternal inheritance is safe in heaven.",HACKNEY.,MAY 1850.,GEORGE OFFOR.,THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.,"COURTEOUS READER, Of all the excellent offices which God the Father has conferred upon Jesus Christ our Lord, this of his being an Advocate with him for us is not the least, though, to the shame of saints it may be spoken, the blessed benefits thereof have not with that diligence and fervent desire been inquired after as they ought.","Christ, as sacrifice, priest, and king, with the glories in, and that flow from, him as such, has, God be thanked, in this our day, been much discovered by our seers, and as much rejoiced in by those who have believed their words; but as he is an Advocate with the Father, an Advocate for us, I fear the excellency of that doth still too much lie hid; though I am verily of opinion that the people of God in this age have as much need of the knowledge thereof, if not more need, than had their brethren that are gone before them.","These words, ""if not more need,"" perhaps may seem to some to be somewhat out of joint; but let the godly wise consider the decays that are among us as to the power of godliness, and what abundance of foul miscarriages the generality of professors now stand guilty of, as also how diligent their great enemy is to accuse them at the bar of God for them, and I think they will conclude, that, in so saying, I indeed have said some truth.","Wherefore, when I thought on this, and had somewhat considered also the transcendent excellency of the advocateship of this our Lord; and again, that but little of the glory thereof has by writing been, in our day, communicated to the church, I adventured to write what I have seen thereof, and do, by what doth follow, present it unto her for good.","I count not myself sufficient for this, or for any other truth as it is in Jesus; but yet, I say, I have told you somewhat of it, according to the proportion of faith.","And I believe that some will thank God for what I here have said about it; but it will be chiefly those, whose right and title to the kingdom of heaven and glory, doth seem to themselves to be called in question by their enemy, at the bar of the Judge of all.","These, I say, will read, and be glad to hear, that they have an Advocate at court that will stand up to plead for them, and that will yet secure to them a right to the heavenly kingdom.","Wherefore, it is more particularly for those that at present, or that hereafter, may be in this dreadful plight, that this my book is now made public; because it is, as I have showed, for such that Jesus Christ is Advocate with the Father.","Of the many and singular advantages, therefore, that such have by this their Advocate in his advocating for them, this book gives some account; as, where he pleads, how he pleads, what he pleads, when he pleads, with whom he pleads, for whom he pleads, and how the enemy is put to shame and silence before their God and all the holy angels.","Here is also showed to those herein concerned, how they indeed may know that Jesus is their Advocate; yea, and how their matters go before their God, the Judge; and particularly that they shall well come off at last, yea, though their cause, as it is theirs, is such, in justification of which, themselves do not dare to show their heads.","Nor have I left the dejected souls without directions how to entertain this Advocate to plead their cause; yea, I have also shown that he will be with ease prevailed with, to stand up to plead for such, as one would think, the very heavens would blush to hear them named by him.","Their comfort also is, that he never lost a cause, nor a soul, for whom he undertook to be an Advocate with God.","But, reader, I will no longer detain thee from the perusal of the discourse.","Read and think; read, and compare what thou readest with the Word of God.","If thou findest any benefit by that thou readest, give the Father, and his Son the glory; and also pray for me.","If thou findest me short in this, or to exceed in that, impute all such things to my weakness, of which I am always full.",Farewell.,"I am thine to serve thee what I may, JOHN BUNYAN.","THE CONTENTS OF THIS TREATISE The apostle's Divine policy, to beget a due regard to his Divine doctrine of eternal life.-The apostle's explication of this expression, viz., The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin.-The apostle's exhortation to separation from sin, as a good effect of a good cause, viz., Forgiveness-The apostle's addition, to prevent misunderstanding, viz., We have an advocate with the Father This brings to the text, in which are two great truths contained: I.","A supposition, viz., That men in Christ may sin.",II.,"An expression, by way of consolation, in case of sin, viz., We have an Advocate with the Father Two things for inquiry in these truths: First.","An inquiry into what our apostle means by sin;

or rather, that that gospel which they had received would certainly usher them in at the gates of the kingdom of heaven, were their reception of it sincere and in truth--for, saith he, then ""the blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God cleanseth you from all sin.""","Having thus far told them what was his errand, he sets upon an explication of what he had said, especially touching our being cleansed from all sin--""Not,"" saith he, ""from a being of sin; for should we say so, we should deceive ourselves,"" and should prove that we have no truth of God in us, but by cleansing, I mean a being delivered from all sin, so as that none at all shall have the dominion over you, to bring you down to hell; for that, for the sake of the blood of Christ, all trespasses are forgiven you.","This done, he exhorts them to shun or fly sin, and not to consent to the motions, workings, enticings, or allurements thereof, saying, ""I write unto you that ye sin not.""","Let not forgiveness have so bad an effect upon you as to cause you to be remiss in Christian duties, or as to tempt you to give, way to evil.",Shall we sin because we are forgiven?,"or shall we not much matter what manner of lives we live, because we are set free from the law of sin and death?",God forbid.,"Let grace teach us another lesson, and lay other obligations upon our spirits.","""My little children,"" saith he, ""these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.""",What things?,"Why, tidings of pardon and salvation, and of that nearness to God, to which you are brought by the precious blood of Christ.","Now, lest also by this last exhortation he should yet be misunderstood, he adds, ""And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the rather, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","I say, he addeth this to prevent desponding in those weak and sensible Christians that are so quick of feeling and of discerning the corruptions of their natures; for these cry out continually that there is nothing that they do but it is attended with sinful weaknesses.","Wherefore, in the words we are presented with two great truths--l. With a supposition, that men in Christ, while in this world, may sin--, ""If any man sin;"" any man; none are excluded; for all, or any one of the all of them that Christ hath redeemed and forgiven, are incident to sin.","By ""may"" I mean, not a toleration, but a possibility; ""For there is not a man, not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not"" (Eccl 7:20; 1 Kings 8:46).",II.,"The other thing with which we are presented is, an Advocate--, ""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","Now there lieth in these two truths two things to be inquired into, as-First, What the apostle should here mean by sin.","Second, And also, what he here doth mean by an advocate-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate.""","There is ground to inquire after the first of these, because, though here he saith, they that sin have an advocate, yet in the very next chapter he saith, ""Such are of the devil, have not seen God, neither know him, nor are of him.""","There is ground also to inquire after the second, because an advocate is supposed in the text to be of use to them that sin--, ""If any man sin, we have an Advocate.""","First, For the first of these--to wit, what the apostle should here mean by sin--, ""If any man sin.""","I answer, since there is a difference in the persons, there must be a difference in the sin.","That there is a difference in the persons is showed before; one is called a child of God, the other is said to be of the wicked one.","Their sins differ also, in their degree at least; for no child of God sins to that degree as to make himself incapable of forgiveness; ""for he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not"" (I John 5:18).","Hence, the apostle says, ""There is a sin unto death"" (v. 16).",See also Matthew 12:32.,Which is the sin from which he that is born of God is kept.,"The sins therefore are thus distinguished: The sins of the people of God are said to be sins that men commit, the others are counted those which are the sins of devils.",1.,"The sins of God's people are said to be sins which men commit, and for which they have an Advocate, though they who sin after the example of the wicked one have none.","""When a man or woman,"" saith Moses, ""shall commit any sin that men commit--they shall confess their sin--and an atonement shall be made for him"" (Num 5:5-7).","Mark, it is when they commit a sin which men commit; or, as Hosea has it, when they transgress the commandment like Adam (Hosea 6:7).","Now, these are the sins under consideration by the apostle, and to deliver us from which, ""we have an Advocate with the Father.""",2.,"But for the sins mentioned in the third chapter, since the persons sinning go here under another character, they also must be of another stamp-to wit, a making head against the person, merits, and grace of Jesus Christ.","These are the sins of devils in the world, and for these there is no remission.","These, they also that are of the wicked one commit, and therefore sin after the similitude of Satan, and so fall into the condemnation of the devil.","Second, But what is it for Jesus to be an Advocate for these?","""If any man sin, we have an Advocate.""","An advocate is one who pleadeth for another at any bar, or before any court of judicature; but of this more in its place.","So, then, we have in the text a Christian, as supposed, committing sin, and a declaration of an Advocate prepared to plead for him-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father.""","And this leads me first to inquire into what, by these words the apostle must, of necessity, presuppose?","For making use here of the similitude or office of an advocate, thereby to show the preservation of the sinning Christian, he must, 1.","Suppose that God, as judge, is now upon the throne of his judgment; for an advocate is to plead at a bar, before a court of judicature.","Thus it is among men; and forasmuch as our Lord Jesus is said to be an ""Advocate with the Father,"" it is clear that there is a throne of judgment also.","This the prophet Micaiah affirms, saying, ""I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left"" (I Kings 22:19).","Sitting upon a throne for judgment; for from the Lord, as then sitting upon that throne, proceeded that sentence against king Ahab, that he should go and fall at Ramoth-gilead; and he did go, and did fall there, as the award or fruit of that judgment.",That is the first.,2.,"The text also supposeth that the saints as well as sinners are concerned at that bar; for the apostle saith plainly that there ""we have an Advocate.""","And the saints are concerned at that bar; because they transgress as well as others, and because the law is against the sin of saints as well as against the sins of other men.","If the saints were not capable of committing of sin, what need would they have of an advocate (I Chron 21:3-6.","I Sam 12:13,14)?4 Yea, though they did sin, yet if they were by Christ so set free from the law as that it could by no means take cognizance of their sins, what need would they have of an advocate?",None at all.,"If there be twenty places where there are assizes kept in this land, yet if I have offended no law, what need have I of an advocate?","Especially if the judge be just, and knows me altogether, as the God of heaven does?","But here is Judge that is just; and here is an Advocate also, an Advocate for the children, an Advocate to plead; for an advocate as such is not of use but before a bar to plead; therefore, here is an offence, and so a law broken by the saints as well as others.",That is the second thing.,3.,"As the text supposes that there is a judge, and crimes of saints, so it supposeth that there is an accuser, one that will carefully gather up the faults of good men, and that will plead them at this bar against them.","Hence we read of ""the accuser of our brethren, that accused them before our God day and night"" (Rev 12:10-12).","For Satan doth not only tempt the godly man to sin, but, having prevailed with him, and made him guilty, he packs away to the court, to God the judge of all; and there addresses himself to accuse that man, and to lay to his charge the heinousness of his offence, pleading against him the law that he has broken, the light against which he did it, and the like.","But now, for the relief and support of such poor people, the apostle, by the text, presents them with an advocate; that is, with one to plead for them, while Satan pleads against them; with one that pleads for pardon, while Satan, by accusing, seeks to pull judgment and vengeance upon our heads.","""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""",That is the third thing.,4.,"As the apostle supposeth a judge, crimes, and an accuser, so he also supposeth that those herein concerned-to wit, the sinning children-neither can nor dare attempt to appear at this bar themselves to plead their own cause before this Judge and against this accuser; for if they could or durst do this, what need they have an advocate?",for an advocate is of use to them whose cause themselves neither can nor dare appear to plead.,"Thus Job prayed for an advocate to plead his cause with God (Job 16:21); and David cries out, ""Enter not into judgment with thy servant,"" O God, ""for in thy sight shall no man living be justified"" (Psa 143:2).","Wherefore, it is evident that saints neither can nor dare adventure to plead their cause.",Alas!,"the Judge is the almighty and eternal God; the law broken is the holy and perfect rule of God, in itself a consuming fire.","The sin is so odious, and a thing so abominable, that it is enough to make all the angels blush to hear it but so much as once mentioned in so holy a place as that is where this great God doth sit to judge.","This sin now hangs about the neck of him that hath committed it; yea, it covereth him as doth a mantle.","The adversary is bold, cunning, and audacious, and can word a thousand of us into an utter silence in less than half a quarter of an hour.","What, then, should the sinner, if he could come there, do at this bar to plead?",Nothing; nothing for his own advantage.,"But now comes in his mercy-he has an Advocate to plead his cause-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""",That is the fourth thing.,"But again, 5.","The apostle also supposeth by the text there is an aptness in Christians when they have sinned, to forget that they ""have an Advocate with the Father""; wherefore this is written to put them in remembrance-""If any may sin, [let him remember] we have an Advocate.""","We can think of all other things well enough-namely, that God is a just judge, that the law is perfectly holy, that my sin is a horrible and an abominable thing, and that I am certainly thereof accused before God by Satan.","These things, I say, we readily think of, and forget them not.","Our conscience puts us in mind of these, our guilt puts us in mind of these, the devil puts us in mind of these, and our reason and sense hold the knowledge and remembrance of these close to us.","All that we forget is, that we have an Advocate, ""an Advocate with the Father""-that is, one that is appointed to take in hand in open court, before all the angels of heaven, my cause, and to plead it by such law and arguments as will certainly fetch me off, though I am clothed with filthy garments; but this, I say, we are apt to forget, as Job when he said, ""O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!""",(Job 16:21).,"Such an one Job had, but he had almost at this time forgot it; as he seems to intimate also where he wisheth for a daysman that might lay his hand upon them both (Job 9:33).","But our mercy is, we have one to plead our cause, ""an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,"" who will not suffer our soul to be spilt and spoiled before the throne, but will surely plead our cause.",6.,"Another thing that the apostle would have us learn from the words is this, that to remember and to believe that Jesus Christ is an Advocate for us when we have sinned, is the next way to support and strengthen our faith and hope.",Faith and hope are very apt to faint when our sins in their guilt do return upon us; nor is there any more proper way to relieve our souls than to understand that the Son of God is our Advocate in heaven.,"True, Christ died for our sins as a sacrifice, and as a priest he sprinkleth with his blood the mercyseat; ay, but here is one that has sinned after profession of faith, that has sinned grievously, so grievously that his sins are come up before God; yea, are at his bar pleaded against him by the accuser of the brethren, by the enemy of the godly.",What shall he do now?,"Why, let him believe in Christ.","Believe, that is true; but how now must he conceive in his mind of Christ for the encouraging of him so to do?","Why, let him call to mind that Jesus Christ is an Advocate with the Father, and as such he meeteth the accuser at the bar of God, pleads for this man that has sinned against this accuser, and prevaileth for ever against him.","Here now, though Satan be turned lawyer, though he accuseth, yea, though his charge against us is true, (for suppose that we have sinned,) ""yet our Advocate is with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","Thus is faith encouraged, thus is hope strengthened, thus is the spirit of the sinking Christian revived, and made to wait for a good deliverance from a bad cause and a cunning adversary; especially if you consider, 7.","That the apostle doth also further suppose by the text that Jesus Christ, as Advocate, if he will but plead our cause, let that be never so black, is able to bring us off, even before God's judgment-seat, to our joy, and the confounding of our adversary; for when he saith, ""We have an Advocate,"" he speaks nothing if he means not thus.","But he doth mean thus, he must mean thus, because he seeketh here to comfort and support the fallen.","""Has any man sinned?","We have an Advocate.""","But what of that, if yet he be unable to fetch us off when charged for sin at the bar, and before the face of a righteous judge?",But he is able to do this.,"The apostle says so, in that he supposes a man has sinned, as any man among the godly ever did; for we may understand it; and if he giveth us not leave to understand it so, he saith nothing to the purpose neither, for it will be objected by some-But can he fetch me off, though I have done as David, as Solomon, as Peter, or the like?","It must be answered, Yes.","The openness of the terms ANY MAN, the indefiniteness of the word SIN, doth naturally allow us to take him in the largest sense; besides, he brings in this saying as the chief, most apt, and fittest to relieve one crushed down to death and hell by the guilt of sin and a wounded conscience.","Further, methinks by these words the apostle seems to triumph in his Christ, saying, My brethren, I would have you study to be holy; but if your adversary the devil should get the advantage of you, and besmear you with the filth of sin, you have yet, besides all that you have heard already, ""an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,"" who is as to his person, in interest with God, his wisdom and worth, able to bring you off, to the comforting of your souls.","Let me, therefore, for a conclusion as to this, give you an exhortation to believe, to hope, and expect, that though you have sinned, (for now I speak to the fallen saint) that Jesus Christ will make a good end with the-""Trust,"" I say, ""in him, and he shall bring it to pass.""","I know I put thee upon a hard and difficult task for believing and expecting good, when my guilty conscience doth nothing but clog, burden, and terrify me with the justice of God, the greatness of thy sins, and the burning torments is hard and sweating work.","But it must be; the text calls for it, thy case calls for it, and thou must do it, if thou wouldst glorify Christ; and this is the way to hasten the issue of thy cause in hand, for believing daunts the devil, pleaseth Christ, and will help thee beforehand to sing that song of the church, saying, ""O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life"" (Lam 3:58).","Yea, believe, and hear thy pleading Lord say to thee, ""Thus saith thy Lord the Lord, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again"" (Isa 51:22).","I am not here discoursing of the sweetness of Christ's nature, but of the excellency of his offices, and of his office of advocateship in particular, which, as a lawyer for his client, he is to execute in the presence of God for us.","Love may be where there is no office, and so where no power is to do us good; but now, when love and office shall meet, they will surely both combine in Christ to do the fallen Christian good.",But of his love we have treated elsewhere; we will here discourse of the office of this loving one.,"And for thy further information, let me tell thee that God thy Father counteth that thou wilt be, when compared with his law, but a poor one all thy days; yea, the apostle tells thee so, in that he saith there is an Advocate provided for thee.","When a father provides crutches for his child, he doth as good as say, I count that my child will be yet infirm; and when God shall provide an Advocate, he doth as good as say, My people are subject to infirmities.","Do not, therefore, think of thyself above what, by plain texts, and fair inferences drawn from Christ's offices, thou are bound to think.","What doth it bespeak concerning thee that Christ is always a priest in heaven, and there ever lives to make intercession for thee (Heb 7:24), but this, that thou art at the best in thyself, yea, and in thy best exercising of all thy graces too, but a poor, pitiful, sorry, sinful man; a man that would, when yet most holy, be certainly cast away, did not thy high priest take away for thee the iniquity of thy holy things.","The age we live in is a wanton age; the godly are not so humble, and low, and base in their own eyes as they should, though their daily experience calls for it, and the priesthood of Jesus Christ too.","But above all, the advocateship of Jesus Christ declares us to be sorry creatures; for that office does, as it were, predict that some time or other we shall basely fall, and by falling be undone, if the Lord Jesus stand not up to plead.","And as it shows this concerning us, so it shows concerning God that he will not lightly or easily lose his people.","He has provided well for us-blood to wash us in; a priest to pray for us, that we may be made to persevere; and, in case we foully fall, an advocate to plead our cause, and to recover us from under, and out of all that danger, that by sin and Satan, we at any time may be brought into.","But having thus briefly passed through that in the text which I think the apostle must necessarily presuppose, I shall now endeavour to enter into the bowels of it, and see what, in a more particular manner, shall be found therein.","And, for my more profitable doing of this work, I shall choose to observe this method in my discourse- [METHOD OF THE DISCOURSE.]","FIRST, I shall show you more particularly of this Advocate's office, or what and wherein Christ's office as Advocate doth lie.","SECOND, After that, I shall also show you how Jesus Christ doth manage this office of an Advocate.","THIRD, I shall also then show you who they are that have Jesus Christ for their Advocate.","FOURTH, I shall also show you what excellent privileges they have, who have Jesus Christ for their Advocate.","FIFTH, And to silence cavillers, I shall also show the necessity of this office of Jesus Christ.","SIXTH, I shall come to answer some objections; and, LASTLY, To the use and application.",[WHEREIN CHRIST'S OFFICE AS ADVOCATE DOTH LIE.],"FIRST, To begin with the first of these-namely, to show you more particularly of Christ's office as an Advocate, and wherein it lieth; the which I shall do these three ways-First, Touch again upon the nature of this office; and then, Second, Treat of the order and place that it hath among the rest of his offices; and, Third, Treat of the occasion of the execution of this office.","First, To touch upon the nature of this office.","It is that which empowereth a man to plead for a man, or one man to plead for another; not in common discourses, and upon common occasions, as any man may do, but at a bar, or before a court of judicature, where a man is accused or impleaded by his enemy; I say, this Advocate's office is such, both here, and in the kingdom of heaven.","An advocate is as one of our attorneys, at least in the general, who pleads according to law and justice for one or other that is in trouble by reason of some miscarriage, or of the naughty temper of some that are about him, who trouble and vex, and labour to bring him into danger of the law.","This is the nature of this office, as I said, on earth; and this is the office that Christ executeth in heaven.","Wherefore he saith, ""If any man sin, we have an Advocate""; one to stand up for him, and to plead for his deliverance before the bar of God.",(Joel 3:2.,Isa 66:16.,Eze 38:22.,Jer 2.),"For though in some places of Scripture Christ is said to plead for his with men, and that by terrible arguments, as by fire, and sword, and famine, and pestilence, yet this is not that which is intended by this text; for the apostle here saith, he is an Advocate with the Father, or before the Father, to plead for those that there, or that to the Father's face, shall be accused for their transgressions: ""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","So, then, this is the employ of Jesus Christ as he is for us, an Advocate.","He has undertaken to stand up for his people at God's bar, and before that great court, there to plead, by the law and justice of heaven, for their deliverance; when, for their faults, they are accused, indicted, or impleaded by their adversary.",Second.,"And now to treat of the order or place that this office of Christ hath among the rest of his offices, which he doth execute for us while we are here in a state of imperfection; and I think it is an office that is to come behind as a reserve, or for a help at last, when all other means shall seem to fail.","Men do not use to go to law upon every occasion; or if they do, the wisdom of the judge, the jury, and the court will not admit that every brangle and foolish quarrel shall come before them; but an Advocate doth then come into place, and then to the exercise of his office, when a cause is counted worthy to be taken notice of by the judge and by the court.","Wherefore he, I say, comes in the last place, as a reserve, or help at last, to plead; and, by pleading, to set that right by law which would otherwise have caused an increase to more doubts, and to further dangers.","Christ, as priest, doth always works of service for us, because in our most spiritual things there may faults and spots be found, and these he taketh away of course, by the exercise of that office; for he always wears that plate of gold upon his forehead before the Father, whereon is written, ""Holiness to the Lord.""","But now, besides these common infirmities, there are faults that are highly gross and foul, that oft are found in the skirts of the children of God.","Now, there are they that Satan taketh hold on; these are they that Satan draweth up a charge against us for; and to save us from these, it is, that the Lord Jesus is made an Advocate.","When Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, then Satan stood at his right hand to resist him; then the angel of the covenant, the Lord Jesus, pleaded for his help (Zech 3).","By all which it appears, that this office comes behind, is provided as a reserve, that we may have help at a pinch, and then be lifted out, when we sink in mire, where there is no standing.","This is yet further hinted at by the several postures that Christ is said to be in, as he exerciseth his priestly and advocate's office.","As a Priest, he sits; as an Advocate, he stands (Isa 3:13).","The Lord stands up when he pleads; his sitting is more constant and of course (Sit thou, Psa 110:1,4), but his standing is occasional, when Joshua is indicted, or when hell and earth are broken loose against his servant Stephen.","For as Joshua was accused by the devil, and as then the angel of the Lord stood by, so when Stephen was accused by men on earth, and that charge seconded by the fallen angels before the face of God, it is said, ""the Lord Jesus stood on the right hand of God,"" (Acts 7:55)-to wit, to plead; for so I take it, because standing is his posture as an Advocate, not as a Priest; for, as a Priest, he must sit down; but he standeth as an Advocate, as has been showed afore (Heb 10:12).","Wherefore, Third.","The occasion of his exercising of this office of advocate is, as hath been hinted already, when a child of God shall be found guilty before God of some heinous sin, of some grievous thing in his life and conversation.","For as for those infirmities that attend the best, in their most spiritual sacrifices; if a child of God were guilty of ten thousand of them, they are of course purged, through the much incense that is always mixed with those sacrifices in the golden censer that is in the hand of Christ; and so he is kept clean, and counted upright, notwithstanding those infirmities; and, therefore, you shall find that, notwithstanding those common faults, the children of God are counted good and upright in conversation, and not charged as offenders.","""David,"" saith the text, ""did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him, all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite"" (I Kings 15:5).","But was David, in a strict sense, without fault in all things else?","No, verily; but that was foul in a higher degree than the rest, and therefore there God sets a blot; ay, and doubtless for that he was accused by Satan before the throne of God; for here is adultery, and murder, and hypocrisy, in David's doings; here is notorious matter, a great sin, and so a great ground for Satan to draw up an indictment against the king; and a thundering one, to be sure, shall be preferred against him.","This is the time, then, for Christ to stand up to plead; for now there is room for such a question-Can David's sin stand with grace?","Or, Is it possible that a man that has done as he has, should yet be found a saint, and so in a saved state?","Or, Can God repute him so, and yet be holy and just?","or, Can the merits of the Lord Jesus reach, according to the law of heaven, a man in this condition?","Here is a case dubious; here is a man whose salvation, by his foul offences, is made doubtful; now we must to law and judgment, wherefore now let Christ stand up to plead!","I say, now was David's case dubious; he was afraid that God would cast him away, and the devil hoped he would, and to that end charged him before God's face, if, perhaps, he might get sentence of damnation to pass upon his soul (Psa 51).","But this was David's mercy, he had an Advocate to plead his cause, by whose wisdom and skill in matters of law and judgment he was brought off of those heavy charges, from those gross sins, and delivered from that eternal condemnation, that by the law of sin and death, was due thereto.","This is then the occasion that Christ taketh to plead, as Advocate, for the salvation of his people-to wit, the cause: He ""pleadeth the cause of his people"" (Is 51:22).","Not every cause, but such and such a cause; the cause that is very bad, and by the which they are involved, not only in guilt and shame, but also in danger of death and hell.","I say, the cause is bad, if the text be true, if sin can make it bad, yea, if sin itself be bad-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate""; an Advocate to plead for him; for him as considered guilty, and so, consequently, as considered in a bad condition.","It is true, we must distinguish between the person and the sin; and Christ pleads for the person, not the sin; but yet He cannot be concerned with the person, but he must be with the sin; for though the person and the sin may be distinguished, yet they cannot be separated.","He must plead, then, not for a person only, but for a guilty person, for a person under the worst of circumstances-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate"" for him as so considered.","When a man's cause is good, it will sufficiently plead for itself, yea, and for its master too, especially when it is made appear so to be, before a just and righteous judge.","Here, therefore, needs no advocate; the judge himself will pronounce him righteous.","This is evidently seen in Job-""Thou movedst me against him (this said God to Satan), to destroy him without cause"" (Job 2:3).","Thus far Job's cause was good, wherefore he did not need an advocate; his cause pleaded for itself, and for its owner also.","But if it was to plead good causes for which Christ is appointed Advocate, then the apostle should have written thus: If any man be righteous, we have an Advocate with the Father.","Indeed, I never heard but one in all my life preach from this text, and he, when he came to handle the cause for which he was to plead, pretended it must be good, and therefore said to the people, See that your cause be good, else Christ will not undertake it.","But when I heard it, Lord, thought I, if this be true, what shall I do, and what will become of all this people, yea, and of this preacher too?","Besides, I saw by the text, the apostle supposeth another cause, a cause bad, exceeding bad, if sin can make it so.",And this was one cause why I undertook this work.,"When we speak of a cause, we speak not of a person simply as so considered; for, as I said before, person and cause must be distinguished; nor can the person make the cause good but as he regulates his action by the Word of God.","If, then, a good, a righteous, man doth what the law condemns, that thing is bad; and if he be indicted for so doing, he is indicted for a bad cause; and he that will be his advocate, must be concerned in and about a bad matter; and how he will bring his client off, therein doth lie the mystery.","I know that a bad man may have a good cause depending before the judge, and so also good men have (Job 31).","But then they are bold in their own cause, and fear not to make mention of it, and in Christ to plead their innocency before the God of heaven, as well as before men (Psa 71:3-5.",II Cor 1:23.,Gal 1:10.,Phil 1:8).,But we have in the text a cause that all men are afraid of-a cause that the apostle concludes so bad that none but Jesus Christ himself can save a Christian from it.,"It is not only sinful, but sin itself-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father.""","Wherefore there is in this place handled by the apostle, one of the greatest mysteries under heaven-to wit, that an innocent and holy Jesus should take in hand to plead for one before a just and righteous God, that has defiled himself with sin; yea, that he should take in hand to plead for such an one against the fallen angels, and that he should also by his plea effectually rescue, and bring them off from the crimes and curse whereof they were verily guilty by the verdict of the law, and approbation of the Judge.","This, I say, is a great mystery, and deserves to be pried into by all the godly, both because much of the wisdom of heaven is discovered in it, and because the best saint is, or may be, concerned with it.","Nor must we by any means let this truth be lost, because it is the truth; the text has declared it so, and to say otherwise is to belie the Word of God, to thwart the apostle, to soothe up hypocrites, to rob Christians of their privilege, and to take the glory from the head of Jesus Christ (Luke 18:11,12).","The best saints are most sensible of their sins, and most apt to make mountains of their mole hills.","Satan also, as has been already hinted, doth labour greatly to prevail with them to sin, and to provoke their God against them, by pleading what is true, or by surmising evilly of them, to the end they may be accused by him (Job 2:9).","Great is his malice toward them, great is his diligence in seeking their destruction; wherefore greatly doth he desire to sift, to try, and winnow them, if perhaps he may work in their flesh to answer his design-that is, to break out in sinful acts, that he may have by law to accuse them to their God and Father.","Wherefore, for their sakes this text abides, that they may see that, when they have sinned, ""they have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","And thus have I showed you the nature, the order, and occasion of this office of our blessed Lord Jesus.",[HOW CHRIST MANAGES THE OFFICE OF AN ADVOCATE.],II.,I come now to show you how Jesus Christ doth manage this his office of an Advocate for us.,"And that I may do this to your edification, I shall choose this method for the opening of it-First.",Show you how he manages this office with his Father.,Second.,I shall show you how he manages it before him against our adversary.,First.,How he manages this his office of Advocate with his Father.,1.,"He doth it by himself, by no other as deputy under him, no angel, no saint; no work has place here but Jesus, and Jesus only.","This the text implies: ""We have an Advocate""; speaking of one, but one, one alone; without an equal or an inferior.","We have but one, and he is Jesus Christ.","Nor is it for Christ's honour, nor for the honour of the law, or of the justice of God, that any but Jesus Christ should be an Advocate for a sinning saint.","Besides, to assert the contrary, what doth it but lessen sin, and make the advocateship of Jesus Christ superfluous?","It would lessen sin should it be removed by a saint or angel; it would make the advocateship of Jesus Christ superfluous, yea, needless, should it be possible that sin could be removed from us by either saint or angel.","Again; if God should admit of more advocates than one, and yet make mention of never an one but Jesus Christ; or if John should allow another, and yet speak nothing but of Jesus only; yea, that an advocate under that title should be mentioned but once, but once only in all the book of God, and yet that divers should be admitted, stands neither with the wisdom or love of God, nor with the faithfulness of the apostle.","But saints have but one Advocate, if they will use him, or improve their faith in that office for their help, so; if not, they must take what follows.","This I thought good to hint at, because the times are corrupt, and because ignorance and superstition always wait for a countenance with us, and these things have a natural tendency to darken all truth, so especially this, which bringeth to Jesus Christ so much glory, and yieldeth to the godly so much help and relief.",2.,"As Jesus Christ alone is Advocate, so God's bar, and that alone, is that before which he pleads, for God is judge himself (Deut 32:36.",Heb 12:23).,"Nor can the cause which now he is to plead be removed into any other court, either by appeals or otherwise.","Could Satan remove us from heaven, to another court, he would certainly be too hard for us, because there we should want our Jesus, our Advocate, to plead our cause.","Indeed, sometimes he impleads us before men, and they are glad of the occasion, for they and he are often one; but then we have leave to remove our cause, and to pray for a trial in the highest court, saying, ""Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal"" (Psa 17:2).","This wicked world doth sentence us for our good deeds, but how then would they sentence us for our bad ones?","But we will never appeal from heaven to earth for right, for here we have no Advocate; ""our Advocate is with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""",3.,"As he pleadeth by himself alone, and nowhere else but in the court of heaven with the Father, so as he pleadeth with the Father for us, he observeth this rule- (1.)","He granteth and confesseth whatever can rightly be charged upon us; yet so as that he taketh the whole charge upon himself, acknowledging the crimes to be his own.","""O God,"" says he, ""thou knowest my foolishness, and my sins""; my guiltiness ""is not hid from thee"" (Psa 69:5).","And this he must do, or else he can do nothing.","If he hides the sin, or lesseneth it, he is faulty; if he leaves it still upon us, we die.","He must, then, take our iniquity to himself, make it his own, and so deliver us; for having thus taken the sin upon himself, as lawfully he may, and lovingly doth, ""for we are members of his body"" ('tis his hand, 'tis his foot, 'tis his ear hath sinned), it followeth that we live if he lives; and who can desire more?","5This, then, must be thoroughly considered, if ever we will have comfort in a day of trouble and distress for sin.","And thus far there is, in some kind, a harmony betwixt his being a sacrifice, a priest, and an Advocate.","As a sacrifice, our sins were laid upon him (Isa 53).","As a priest, he beareth them (Exo 28:38).","And as an Advocate, he acknowledges them to be his own (Psa 69:5).","Now, having acknowledged them to be his own, the quarrel is no more betwixt us and Satan, for the Lord Jesus has espoused our quarrel, and made it his.","All, then, that we in this matter have to do, is to stand at the bar by faith among the angels, and see how the business goes.",O blessed God!,what a lover of mankind art thou!,"and how gracious is our Lord Jesus, in his thus managing matters for us.",(2.),"The Lord Jesus having thus taken our sins upon himself, next pleads his own goodness to God on our behalf, saying, ""Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel: because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face"" (Psa 69:6,7).","Mark, let them not be ashamed for my sake, let them not be confounded for my sake.","Shame and confusion are the fruits of guilt, or of a charge for sin, (Jer 3:25), and are but an entrance into condemnation (Dan 12:2.",John 5:29).,"But behold how Christ pleads, saying, Let not that be for my sake, for the merit of my blood, for the perfection of my righteousness, for the prevalency of my intercession.","Let them not be ashamed for my sake, O Lord God of hosts.","And let no man object, because this text is in the Psalms, as if it were not spoken by the prophet of Christ; for both John and Paul, yea, and Christ himself, do make this psalm a prophecy of him.","Compare verse 9 with John 2:17, and with Romans 15:3; and verse 21 with Matthew 27:48, and Mark 15:25.","But is not this a wonderful thing, that Christ should first take our sins, and account them his own, and then plead the value and worth of his whole self for our deliverance?","For by these words, ""for my sake,"" he pleads his own self, his whole self, and all that he is and has; and thus he put us in good estate again, though our cause was very bad.",To bring this down to weak capacities.,"Suppose a man should be indebted twenty thousand pounds, but has not twenty thousand farthings wherewith to pay; and suppose also that this man be arrested for this debt, and that the law also, by which he is sued, will not admit of a penny bate; this man may yet come well enough off, if his advocate or attorney will make the debt his own, and will, in the presence of the judges, out with his bags, and pay down every farthing.","Why, this is the way of our Advocate.",Our sins are called debts (Matt 6:12).,We are sued for them at the law (Luke 12:59).,"And the devil is our accuser; but behold the Lord Jesus comes out with his worthiness, pleads it at the bar, making the debt his own (Mark 10:45.",II Cor 3:5).,"And saith, Now let them not be ashamed for my sake, O Lord God of hosts: let them not be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.","And hence, as he is said to be an Advocate, so he is said to be a propitiation, or amends-maker, or one that appeaseth the justice of God for our sins-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins.""",And who can now object against the deliverance of the child of God?,"God cannot; for he, for Christ's sake, according as he pleaded, hath forgiven us all trespasses (Col 2:13, Eph 4:32).","The devil cannot; his mouth is stopped, as is plain in the case of Joshua (Zech 3).",The law cannot; for that approveth of what Christ has done.,"This, then, is the way of Christ's pleading.","You must know, that when Christ pleads with God, he pleads with a just and righteous God, and therefore he must plead law, and nothing but law; and this he pleaded in both these pleas-First, in confessing of the sin he justified the sentence of the law in pronouncing of it evil; and then in his laying of himself, his whole self, before God for that sin, he vindicated the sanction and perfection of the law.","Thus, therefore, he magnifies the law, and makes it honourable, and yet brings off his client safe and sound in the view of all the angels of God.",(3).,"The Lord Jesus having thus taken our sins upon himself, and presented God with all the worthiness that is in his whole self for them, in the next place he calleth for justice, or a just verdict upon the satisfaction he hath made to God and to his law.","Then proclamation is made in open court, saying, ""Take away the filthy garments from him,"" from him that hath offended, and clothe him with change of raiment (Zech 3).","Thus the soul is preserved that hath sinned; thus the God of heaven is content that he should be saved; thus Satan is put to confusion, and Jesus applauded and cried up by the angels of heaven, and by the saints on earth.","Thus have I showed you how Christ doth advocate it with God and his Father for us; and I have been the more particular in this, because the glory of Christ, and the comfort of the dejected, are greatly concerned and wrapped up in it.","Look, then, to Jesus, if thou hast sinned; to Jesus, as an Advocate pleading with the Father for thee.","Look to nothing else; for he can tell how, and that by himself, to deliver thee; yea, and will do it in a way of justice, which is a wonder; and to the shame of Satan, which will be his glory; and also to thy complete deliverance, which will be thy comfort and salvation.","Second, But to pass this and come to the second thing, which is, to show you how the Lord Jesus manages this his office of an Advocate before his Father against the adversary; for he pleadeth with the Father, but pleadeth against the devil; he pleadeth with the Father law and justice, but against the adversary he letteth out himself.","I say, as he pleads against the adversary, so he enlargeth himself with arguments over and besides those which he pleadeth with God his Father.","Nor is it meet or needful that our advocate, when he pleads against Satan, should so limit himself to matter of law, as when he pleadeth with his Father.","The saint, by sinning, oweth Satan nothing; no law of his is broken thereby; why, then, should he plead for the saving of his people, justifying righteousness to him?","Christ, when he died, died not to satisfy Satan, but his Father; not to appease the devil, but to answer the demands of the justice of God; nor did he design, when he hanged on the tree, to triumph over his Father, but over Satan; ""He redeemed us,"" therefore, ""from the curse of the law,"" by his blood (Gal 3:13).","And from the power of Satan, by his resurrection (Heb 2:14).",He delivered us from righteous judgment by price and purchase; but from the rage of hell by fight and conquest.,"And as he acted thus diversely in the work of our redemption, even so he also doth in the execution of his Advocate's office.","When he pleadeth with God, he pleadeth so; and when he pleadeth against Satan, he pleadeth so; and how he pleadeth with God when he dealeth with law and justice I have showed you.","And now I will show you how he pleadeth before him against the ""accuser of the brethren.""",1.,"He pleads against him the well-pleasedness that his Father has in his merits, saying, This shall please the Lord, or this doth or will please the Lord, better than anything that can be propounded (Psa 69:31).","Now this plea being true, as it is, being established upon the liking of God Almighty; whatever Satan can say to obtain our everlasting destruction is without ground, and so unreasonable.","""I am well pleased,"" saith God (Matt 3:17); and again, ""The Lord is well pleased for his (Christ's) righteousness' sake"" (Isa 42:21).","All that enter actions against others, pretend that wrong is done, either against themselves or against the king.","Now Satan will never enter an action against us in the court above, for that wrong by us has been done to himself; he must pretend, then, that he sues us, for that wrong has, by us, been done to our king.","But, behold, ""We have an Advocate with the Father,"" and he has made compensation for our offences.",He gave himself for our offences.,"But still Satan maintains his suit; and our God, saith Christ, is well pleased with us for this compensation-sake, yet he will not leave off his clamour.","Come, then, says the Lord Jesus, the contention is not now against my people, but myself, and about the sufficiency of the amends that I have made for the transgressions of my people; but he is near that justifieth me, that approveth and accepteth of my doings, therefore shall I not be confounded.",Who is mine adversary?,Let him come near me!,"Behold, ""the Lord God will help me"" (Isa 50:7-9).",Who is he that condemneth me?,"Lo, they all shall, were there ten thousand times as many more of them, wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.","Wherefore, if the Father saith Amen to all this, as I have showed already that he hath and doth, the which also further appeareth, because the Lord God has called him the Saviour, the Deliverer, and the Amen; what follows, but that a rebuke should proceed from the throne against him?","And this, indeed, our Advocate calls for from the hand of his Father, saying, O enemy, ""the Lord rebuke thee""; yea, he doubles this request to the judge, to intimate his earnestness for such a conclusion, or to show that the enemy shall surely have it, both from our Advocate, and from him before whom Satan has so grievously accused us (Zech 3).","For what can be expected to follow from such an issue in law as this is, but sound and severe snibs from the judge upon him that hath thus troubled his neighbour, and that hath, in the face of the country, cast contempt upon the highest act of mercy, justice, and righteousness, that ever the heavens beheld?","6 And all this is true with reference to the case in hand, wherefore, ""The Lord rebuke thee,"" is that which, in conclusion, Satan must have for the reward of his works of malice against the children, and for his contemning of the works of the Son of God.","Now, our Advocate having thus established, by the law of heaven, his plea with God for us against our accuser, there is way made for him to proceed upon a foundation that cannot be shaken; wherefore, he proceedeth in his plea, and further urges against this accuser of the brethren.",2.,"God's interest in this people; and prayeth that God would remember that: ""The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee.""","True, the church, the saints, are despicable in the world; wherefore men do think to tread them down; the saints are, also, weak in grace, but have corruptions that are strong, and, therefore, Satan, the god of this world, doth think to tread them down; but the saints have a God, the living, the eternal God, and, therefore, they shall not be trodden down; yea, they ""shall be holden up, for God is able to make them stand"" (Rom 14:4).","It was Haman's mishap to be engaged against the queen, and the kindred of the queen; it was that that made him he could not prosper; that brought him to contempt and the gallows.","Had he sought to ruin another people, probably he might have brought his design to a desired conclusion; but his compassing the death of the queen spoiled all.","Satan, also, when he fighteth against the church, must be sure to come to the worst, for God has a concern in that; therefore, it is said, ""The gates of hell shall not prevail against it""; but this hindereth not but that he is permitted to make almost what spoils he will of those that belong not to God.","Oh, how many doth he accuse, and soon get out from God, against them, a license to destroy them!","as he served Ahab, and many more.","But this, I say, is a very great block in his way when he meddles with the children; God has an interest in them-""Hath God cast away his people?","God forbid!""","(Rom 11:1,2).","The text intimates that they for sin had deserved it, and that Satan would fain have had it been so; but God's interest in them preserved them-""God hath not cast away his people, which he foreknew.""","Wherefore, when Satan accuseth them before God, Christ, as he pleadeth his own worth and merit, pleadeth also against him, that interest that God has in them.","And though this, to some, may seem but an indifferent plea; for what engagement lieth, may they say, upon God to be so much concerned with them, for they sin against him, and often provoke him most bitterly?","Besides, in their best state, they are altogether vanity, and a very thing of nought-""What is man (sorry man), that thou art mindful of him,"" or that thou shouldest be so?","I answer, Thought there lieth no engagement upon God for any worthiness that is in man, yet there lieth a great deal upon God for the worthiness that is in himself.","God has engaged himself with his having chosen them to be a people to himself; and by this means they are so secured from all that all can do against them, that the apostle is bold, upon this very account, to challenge all despite to do its worst against them, saying, ""Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?""",(Rom 8:33).,Who?,"saith Satan; why, that will I. Ay, saith he, but who can do it, and prevail?","""It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth?""",(ver.,34).,"By which words the apostle clearly declareth that charges against the elect, though they may be brought against them, must needs prove ineffectual as to their condemnation; because their Lord God still will justify, for that Christ has died for them.","Besides, a little to enlarge, the elect are bound to God by a sevenfold cord, and a threefold one is not quickly broken.",(1.),"Election is eternal as God himself, and so without variableness or shadow of change, and hence it is called ""an eternal purpose,"" and a ""purpose of God"" that must stand (Eph 3:11; Rom 9:11).",(2.),"Election is absolute, not conditional; and, therefore, cannot be overthrown by the sin of the man that is wrapped up therein.","No works foreseen to be in us was the cause of God's choosing us; no sin in us shall frustrate or make election void-""Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?","It is God that justifieth"" (Rom 8:33; 9:11).",(3.),"By the act of election the children are involved, wrapped up, and covered in Christ; he hath chosen us in him; not in ourselves, not in our virtues, no, not for or because of anything, but of his own will (Eph 1:4-11).",(4.),"Election includeth in it a permanent resolution of God to glorify his mercy on the vessels of mercy, thus foreordained unto glory (Rom 9:15,18,23).",(5.),"By the act of electing love, it is concluded that all things whatsoever shall work together for the good of them whose call to God is the fruit of this purpose, this eternal purpose of God (Rom 8:28-30).",(6.),"The eternal inheritance is by a covenant of free and unchangeable grace made over to those thus chosen; and to secure them from the fruits of sin, and from the malice of Satan, it is sealed by this our Advocate's blood, as he is Mediator of this covenant, who also is become surety to God for them; to wit, to see them forthcoming at the great day, and to set them then safe and sound before his Father's face after the judgment is over (Rom 9:23; Heb 7:22; 9:15,17-24; 13:20; John 10:28,29).",(7.),"By this choice, purpose, and decree, the elect, the concerned therein, have allotted them by God, and laid up for them, in Christ, a sufficiency of grace to bring them through all difficulties to glory; yea, and they, every one of them, after the first act of faith-the which also they shall certainly attain, because wrapped up in the promise for them-are to receive the earnest and first fruits thereof into their souls (II Tim 1:9; Acts 14:22; Eph 1:4,5,13,14).","Now, put all these things together, and then feel if there be not weight in this plea of Christ against the devil.","He pleads God's choice and interest in his saints against him-an interest that is secured by the wisdom of heaven, by the grace of heaven, by the power, will, and mercy of God, in Christ-an interest in which all the three Persons in the Godhead have engaged themselves, by mutual agreement and operation, to make good when Satan has done his all.","I know there are some that object against this doctrine as false; but such, perhaps, are ignorant of some things else as well as of this.","However, they object against the wisdom of God, whose truth it is, and against Christ our Advocate, whose argument, as he is such, it is; yea, they labour, what in them lieth, to wrest that weapon out of his hand, with which he so cudgelleth the enemy when, as Advocate, he pleadeth so effectually against him for the rescuing of us from the danger of judgment, saying, ""The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee.""",Third.,"As Christ, as Advocate, pleads against Satan the interest that his Father hath in his chosen, so also he pleads against him by no less authority-his own interest in them.","""Holy Father,"" saith he, ""keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me"" (John 17:11).","Keep them while in the world from the evil, the soul-damning evil of it.","These words are directed to the Father, but they are leveled against the accusations of the enemy, and were spoken here to show what Christ will do for his, against our foe, when he is above.","How, I say, he will urge before his Father his own interest in us against Satan, and against all his accusations, when he brings them to the bar of God's tribunal, with design to work our utter ruin.",And is there not a great deal in it?,"As if Christ should say, Father, my people have an adversary who will accuse them for their faults before thee; but I will be their Advocate, and as I have bought them of thee, I will plead my right against him (John 10:28).","Our English proverb is, Interest will not lie; interest will make a man do that which otherwise he would not.","How many thousands are there for whom Christ doth not so much as once open his mouth, but leaves them to the accusations of Satan, and to Ahab's judgment, nay, a worse, because there is none to plead their cause?",And why doth he not concern himself with them?,"but because he is not interested in them-""I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for they are thine; and all mine are thine, and I am glorified in them"" (John 17:9,10).","Suppose so many cattle in such a pound, and one goes by whose they are not, doth he concern himself?","No; he beholds them, and goes his way.","But suppose that at his return he should find his own cattle in that pound, would he now carry it toward them as he did unto the other?","No, no; he has interest here, they are his that are in the pound; now he is concerned, now he must know who put them there, and for what cause too they are served as they are; and if he finds them rightfully there, he will fetch them by ransom; but if wrongfully, he will replevy7 them, and stand a trial at law with him that has thus illegally pounded his cattle.",And thus it is betwixt Jesus Christ and his.,"He is interested in them; the cattle are his own, ""his own sheep,"" (John 10:3,4), but pounded by some other, by the law, or by the devil.","If pounded by the law, he delivereth them by ransom; if pounded by the devil, he will replevy them, stand a trial at law for them, and will be, against their accuser, their Advocate himself.","Nor can Satan withstand his plea, though he should against them join argument with the law; forasmuch, as has been proved before, he can and will, by what he has to produce and plead of his own, save his from all trespasses, charges, and accusations.","Besides, all men know that a man's proper goods are not therefore forfeited, because they commit many, and them too great transgressions-""And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","Now, the strength of this plea thus grounded upon Christ's interest in his people is great, and hath many weighty reasons on its side; as- 1.","They are mine; therefore in reason at my dispose, not at the dispose of an adversary; for while a thing can properly be called mine, no man has therewith to do but myself; nor doth (a man, nor) Christ close his right to what he has by the weakness of that thing which is his proper right.","He, therefore, as an Advocate, pleadeth interest, his own interest, in his people, and right must, with the Judge of all the earth, take place-""Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?""",(Gen 18:25).,2.,They cost him dear; and that which is dear bought is not easily parted with (I Cor.,6:20).,"They were bought with ""his blood"" (Eph 1:7; I Peter 1:18,19).","They were given him for his blood, and therefore are ""dear children"" (Eph 5:1); for they are his by the highest price; and this price he, as Advocate, pleadeth against the enemy of our salvation; yea, I will add, they are his, because he gave his all for them (II Cor 8:9).","When a man shall give his all for this or that, then that which he so hath purchased is become his all.","Now Christ has given his all for us; he made himself poor for us, wherefore we are become his all, his fullness; and so the church is called (Eph 1:23).","Nay, further, Christ likes well enough of his purchase, though it hath cost him his all-""The lines,"" says he, ""are fallen to me in pleasant places; I have a goodly heritage"" (Psa 16:6).","Now, put all these things together, and there is a strong plea in them.","Interest, such an interest, will not be easily parted with.","But this is not all; for, 3.","As they cost him dear, so he hath made them near to himself, near by way of relation.","Now that which did not only cost dear, but that by way of relation is made so, that a man will plead heartily for.","Said David to Abner, ""Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face"" (II Sam 3:13,14).",Saul's daughter cost me dear; I bought her with the jeopardy of my life; Saul's daughter is near to me; she is my beloved wife.,"He pleaded hard for her, because she was dear and near to him.","Now, I say, the same is true in Christ; his people cost him dear, and he hath made them near unto him; wherefore, to plead interest in them, is to hold by an argument that is strong.",(a.),"They are his spouse, and he hath made them so; they are his love, his dove, his darling, and he accounts them so.","Now, should a wretch attempt, in open court, to take a man's wife away from him, how would this cause the man to plead!","Yea, and what judge that is just, and knows that the man has this interest in the woman pleaded for, would yield to, or give a verdict for the wretch, against the man whose wife the woman is?","Thus Christ, in pleading interest-in pleading ""thou gavest them me""-pleads by a strong argument, an argument that the enemy cannot invalidate.","True, were Christ to plead this before a Saul (I Sam 25;44), or before Samson's wife's father, the Philistine (Judg 14:20), perhaps such treacherous judges would give it against all right.","But, I have told you, the court in which Christ pleads is the highest and the justest, and that from which there can be no appeal; wherefore Christ's cause, and so the cause of the children of God, must be tried before their Father, from whose face, to be sure, just judgment shall proceed.","But, (b.)","As they are called his spouse, so they are called his flesh, and members of his body.","Now, said Paul to the church, ""Ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular"" (I Cor 12:27; Eph 5:30).",This relation also makes a man plead hard.,"Were a man to plead for a limb, or a member of his own, how would he plead?",What arguments would he use?,And what sympathy and feeling would his arguments flow from?,"I cannot lose a hand, I cannot lose a foot, cannot lose a finger; why, saints are Christ's members, his members are of himself.","With what strength of argument would a man plead the necessariness of his members to him, and the unnaturalness of his adversary in seeking the destruction of his members, and the deformity of his body!","Yea, a man would shuck and cringe, and weep, and entreat, and make demurs, and halts, and delays, to a thousand years, if possible, before he would lose his members, or any one of them.","But, I say, how would he plead and advocate it for his members, if judge, and law, and reason, and equity, were all on his side, and if, by the adversary, there could be nothing urged, but that against which the Advocate had long before made provision for the effectual overthrow thereof?",And all this is true as to the case that lies before us.,"Thus we see what strength there lieth in this second argument, that our Advocate bringeth for us against the enemy.","They are his flesh and bones, his members; he cannot spare them; he cannot spare this, because, nor that, because, nor any, because, they are his members.","As such, they are lovely to him; as such, they are useful to him; as such, they are an ornament to him; yea, though in themselves they are feeble, and through infirmity weak, much disabled from doing as they should.","Thus, ""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","But, 4.","As Christ, as Advocate, pleads for us, against Satan, his Father's interest in us and his own; so he pleadeth against him that right and property that he hath in heaven, to give it to whom he will.","He has a right to heaven as Priest and King; it is his also by inheritance; and since he will be so good a benefactor as to bestow this house on somebody, but not for their deserts, but not for their goodness, and since, again, he has to that end spilt his blood for, and taken a generation into covenant relation to him, that it might be bestowed on them; it shall be bestowed on them; and he will plead this, if there be need, if his people sin, and if their accuser seeks, by their sin, their ruin and destruction: ""Father,"" saith he, ""I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me"" (John 17:24).","Christ's will is the will of heaven, the will of God.","Shall not Christ, then, prevail?","""I will,"" saith Christ; ""I will,"" saith Satan; but whose will shall stand?","It is true, Christ in the text speaks more like an arbitrator than an Advocate; more like a judge than one pleading at a bar.","I will have it so; I judge that so it ought to be, and must.","But there is also something of plea in the words both before his Father, and against our enemy; and therefore he speaketh like one that can plead and determine also; yea, like one that has power so to do.",But shall the will of heaven stoop to the will of hell?,Or the will of Christ to the will of Satan?,Or the will of righteousness to the will of sin?,"Shall Satan, who is God's enemy, and whose charge wherewith he chargeth us for sin, and which is grounded, not upon love to righteousness, but upon malice against God's designs of mercy, against the blood of Christ, and the salvation of his people-I say, shall this enemy and this charge prevail with God against the well-grounded plea of Christ, and against the salvation of God's elect, and so keep us out of heaven?","No, no; Christ will have it otherwise, he is the great donator, 8 and his eye is good.","True, Satan was turned out of heaven for that he sinned there, and we must be taken into heaven, though we have sinned here; this is the will of Christ, and, as Advocate, he pleads it against the face and accusation of our adversary.","Thus, ""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","But, 5.","As Christ, as Advocate, pleadeth for us, against Satan, his Father's interest in us, and his own, and pleadeth also what right he has to dispose of the kingdom of heaven; so he pleadeth against this enemy, that malice and enmity that is in him, and upon which chiefly his charge against us is grounded, to the confusion of his face.","This is evident from the title that our Advocate bestows upon him, while he pleads for us against him: ""The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, O enemy,"" saith he; for Satan is an enemy, and this name given him signifies so much.","And lawyers, in their pleas, can make a great matter of such a circumstance as this; saying, My lord, we can prove that what is now pleaded against the prisoner at the bar is of mere malice and hatred, that has also a long time lain burning and raging in his enemy's breast against him.","This, I say, will greatly weaken the plea and accusation of an enemy.","But, says Jesus Christ, ""Father, here is a plea brought in against my Joshua, that clothes him with filthy garments, but it is brought in against him by an enemy, by an enemy in the superlative or highest degree.","One that hates goodness worse than he, and that loveth wickedness more than the man against whom at this time he has brought such a heinous charge.""","Then leaving with the Father the value of his blood for the accused, he turneth him to the accuser, and pleads against him as an enemy: ""O Satan, thou that accusest my spouse, my love, my members, art SATAN, an enemy.""",But it will be objected that the things charged are true.,Grant it; yet what law takes notice of the plea of one who doth professedly act as an enemy?,"because it is not done of love to truth, and justice, and righteousness, nor intended for the honour of the king, nor for the good of the prosecuted; but to gratify malice and rage, and merely to kill and destroy.","There is, therefore, a great deal of force and strength in an Advocate's pleading of such a circumstance against an accuser; especially when the crimes now charged are those, and only those for which the law, in the due execution of it, has been satisfied before; wherefore now a lawyer has double and treble ground or matter to plead for his client against his enemy.",And this advantage against him has Jesus Christ.,"Besides, it is well known that Satan, as to us, is the original cause of those very crimes for which he accuses us at the bar of God's tribunal.","Not to say anything of how he cometh to us, solicits us, tempts us, flatters us, and always, in a manner, lies at us to do those wicked things for which he so hotly pursues us to the bar of the judgment of God.","For though it is not meet for us thus to plead,-to wit, laying that fault upon Satan, but rather upon ourselves,-yet our advocate will do it, and make work of it too before God.","""Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he might sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not"" (Luke 22:31,32).","He maketh here mention of Satan's desires, by way of advantage against him; and, doubtless, so he did in his prayer with God for Peter's preservation.","And what he did here, while on earth, as a Saviour in general, that he doth now in heaven as a Priest and an Advocate in special.","I will further suppose that which may be supposed, and that which is suitable to our purpose.","Suppose, therefore, that a father that has a child whom he loveth, but the child has not half that wit that some of the family hath, and I am sure that we have less wit than angels; and suppose, also, that some bad-minded neighbour, by tampering with, tempting of, and by unwearied solicitations, should prevail with this child to steal something out of his father's house or grounds, and give it unto him; and this he doth on purpose to set the father against the child; and suppose, again, that it comes to the father's knowledge that the child, through the allurements of such an one, has done so and so against his father; will he therefore disinherit this child?","Yea, suppose, again, that he that did tempt this child to steal, should be the first that should come to accuse this child to its father for so doing, would the father take notice of the accusation of such an one?-No, verily, we that are evil can do better than so; how then should we think that the God of heaven should do such a thing, since also we have a brother that is wise, and that will and can plead the very malice of our enemy that doth to us all these things against him for our advantage?-I say, this is the sum of this fifth plea of Christ our Advocate, against Satan.","O Satan, says he, thou art an enemy to my people; thou pleadest not out of love to righteousness, not to reform, but to destroy my beloved and inheritance.",The charge wherewith thou chargest my people is thine own (Job 8:4-6).,"Not only as to a matter of charge, but the things that thou accusest them of are thine, thine in the nature of them.","Also, thou hast tempted, allured, flattered, and daily laboured with them, to do that for which now thou so willingly would have them destroyed.","Yea, all this hast thou done of envy to my Father, and to godliness; of hatred to me and my people; and that thou mightest destroy others besides (I Chron 21:1).","And now, what can this accuser say?",Can he excuse himself?,Can he contradict our Advocate?,"He cannot; he knows that he is a Satan, an enemy, and as an adversary has he sown his tares among the wheat, that it might be rooted up; but he shall not have his end; his malice has prevented9 him, and so has the care and grace of our Advocate.","The tares, therefore, he shall have returned unto him again; but the wheat, for all this, shall be gathered into God's barn (Matt 13:25-30).","Thus, therefore, our Advocate makes use, in his plea against Satan, of the rage and malice that is the occasion of the enemy's charge wherewith he accuseth the children of God.","Wherefore, when thou readest these words, ""O Satan,"" say with thyself, thus Christ our Advocate accuseth our adversary of malice and envy against God and goodness, while he accuseth us of the sins which we commit, for which we are sorry, and Christ has paid a price of redemption-""And (thus) if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","But, 6.","Christ, when he pleads as an Advocate for his people, in the presence of God against Satan, he can plead those very weaknesses of his people for which Satan would have them damned, for their relief and advantage.","""Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?""","This is part of the plea of our Advocate against Satan for his servant Joshua, when he said, ""The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan"" (Zech3:2).","Now, to be a brand plucked out of the fire is to be a saint, impaired, weakened, defiled, and made imperfect by sin; for so also the apostle means when he saith, ""And others save with fear, pulling them our of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh"" (Jude 23).","By fire, in both these places, we are to understand sin; for that it burns and consumes as fire (Rom 1:27).","Wherefore a man is said to burn when his lusts are strong upon him; and to burn in lusts to others, when his wicked heart runs wickedly after them (I Cor 7:9).","Also, when Abraham said, ""I am but dust and ashes,"" (Gen 18:27), he means he was but what sin had left; yea, he had something of the smutch and besmearings of sin yet upon him.","Wherefore it was a custom with Israel, in days of old, when they set days apart for confession of sin, and humiliation for the same, to sprinkle themselves with, or to wallow in dust and ashes, as a token that they did confess they were but what sin had left, and that they also were defiled, weakened, and polluted by it (Esth 4:1,3; Jer 6:26; Job 30:19, 42:6).","This, then, is the next plea of our goodly Advocate for us: O Satan, this is ""a brand plucked out of the fire.""","As who should say, Thou objected against my servant Joshua that he is black like a coal, or that the fire of sin at times is still burning in him.",And what then?,"The reason why he is not totally extinct, as tow; is not thy pity, but my Father's mercy to him; I have plucked him out of the fire, yet not so out but that the smell thereof is yet upon him; and my Father and I, we consider his weakness, and pity him; for since he is as a brand pulled out, can it be expected by my Father or me that he should appear before us as clear, and do our biddings as well, as if he had never been there?","This is ""a brand plucked out of the fire,"" and must be considered as such, and must be borne with as such.","Thus, as Mephibosheth pleaded for his excuse, his lameness,(II Sam 19:24-26), so Christ pleads the infirm and indigent condition of his people, against Satan, for their advantage.","Wherefore Christ, by such pleas as these for his people, doth yet further show the malice of Satan (for all this burning comes through him), yea, and by it he moveth the heart of God to pity us, and yet to be gentle, and long-suffering, and merciful to us; for pity and compassion are the fruits of the yearning of God's bowels towards us, while he considereth us as infirm and weak, and subject to slips, and stumbles, and falls, because of weakness.","And that Christ our Advocate, by thus pleading, doth turn things to our advantage, consider, (1.)","That God is careful, that through our weakness, our spirits do not fail before him when he chides (Isa 57:16-18).",(2.),"""He stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind,"" and debates about the measure of affliction, when, for sin, we should be chastened, lest we should sink thereunder (Isa 27:7-9).",(3.),"He will not strictly mark what is done amiss, because if he should, we cannot stand (Psa 130:3).",(4.),"When he threateneth to strike, his bowels are troubled, and his repentings are kindled together (Hosea 11:8,9).",(5.),"He will spin out his patience to the utmost length, because he knows we are such bunglers at doing (Jer 9:24).",(6.),"He will accept of the will for the deed, because he knows that sin will make our best performances imperfect (II Cor 8:12).",(7.),"He will count our little a very great deal, for that he knows we are so unable to do anything at all (Job 1:21).",(8.),"He will excuse the souls of his people, and lay the fault upon their flesh, which has greatest affinity with Satan, if through weakness and infirmity we do not do as we should (Matt 26:41; Rom 7).","Now, as I said, all these things happen unto us, both infirmities and pity, because and for that we were once in the fire, and for that the weakness of sin abides upon us to this day.","But none of this favour could come to us, nor could we, by any means, cause that our infirmities should work for us thus advantageously; but that Christ our Advocate stands our friend, and pleads for us as he doth.","But again, before I pass this over, I will, for the clearing of this, present you with a few more considerations, which are of another rank-to wit, that Christ our Advocate, as such, makes mention of our weaknesses so, against Satan, and before his Father, as to turn all to our advantage.",(1.),"We are therefore to be saved by grace, because by reason of sin we are disabled from keeping of the law (Deut 9:5; Isa 64:6).",(2.),"We have given unto us the Spirit of grace to help, because we can do nothing that is good without it (Eph 2:5; Rom 8:26).",(3.),"God has put Christ's righteousness upon us to cover our nakedness with, because we have none of our own to do it withal (Phil 3:7,8; Eze 16:8).",(4.),"God alloweth us to ride in the bosom of Christ to the grave, and from thence in the bosom of angels to heaven, because our own legs are not able to carry us thither (Isa 40:11, 46:4; Psa 48:14; Luke 16:22).",(5.),"God has made his Son our Head, our Priest, our Advocate, our Saviour, our Captain, that we may be delivered from all the infirmities and all the fiends that attend us, and that plot to do us hurt (Eph 1:22; Col 1:18; Heb 7:21).",(6.),"God has put the fallen angels into chains, (II Peter 2:4; Rev 20:1,2), that they might not follow us too fast, and has enlarged us, (Psa 4:1), and directed our feet in the way of his steps, that we may haste us to the strong tower and city of refuge for succour and safety, and has given good angels a charge to look to us (Heb 1:14; Psa 34:7).",(7.),"God has promised that we, at our counting days, shall be spared, ""as a man spareth his own son that serveth him"" (Mal 3:17).","Now, from all these things, it appears that we have indulgence at God's hand, and that our weaknesses, as our Christ manages the matter for us, are so far off from laying a block or bar in the way to the enjoyment of favour, that they also work for our good; yea, and God's foresight of them has so kindled his bowels and compassion to us, as to put him upon devising of such things for our relief, which by no means could have been, had not sin been with us in the world, and had not the best of saints been ""as a brand plucked out of the burning.""","I have seen men (and yet they are worse than God) take most care of, and, also, best provide for, those of their children that have been most infirm and helpless; 10 and our Advocate ""shall gather his lambs with his arms, and carry them in his bosom""; yea, and I know that there is such an art in showing and making mention of weaknesses as shall make the tears stand in a parent's eyes, and as shall make him search to the bottom of his purse to find out what may do his weakling good.","Christ, also, has that excellent art, as he is an Advocate with the Father for us; he can so make mention of us and of our infirmities, while he pleads before God, against the devil, for us, that he can make the bowels of the Almighty yearn towards us, and to wrap us up in their compassions.","You read much of the pity, compassion, and of the yearning of the bowels of the mighty God towards his people; all which, I think, is kindled and made burn towards us, by the pleading of our Advocate.","I have seen fathers offended with their children; but when a brother had turned a skillful advocate, the anger has been appeased, and the means have been concealed.","We read but little of this Advocate's office of Jesus Christ, yet much of the fruit of it is extended to the churches; but as the cause of smiles, after offences committed, is made manifest afterwards, so at the day when God will open all things, we shall see how many times our Lord, as an Advocate, pleaded for us, and redeemed us by his so pleading, unto the enjoyments of smiles and embraces, who, for sin, but a while before, were under frowns and chastisements.","And thus much for the making out how Christ doth manage his office of being an Advocate for us with the Father-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","[WHO HAVE CHRIST FOR AN ADVOCATE] THIRDLY, And I shall come now to the third head; to wit, to show you more particularly who they are that have Jesus Christ for their Advocate.","In my handling of this head, I shall show, First, That this office of an advocate differeth from that of a priest, and how.","Second, I shall show you how far Christ extendeth this his office of advocateship-I mean, in matters concerning the people of God, And then, Third, I shall come more directly to show who they are that have Christ for their Advocate.","First, For the first of these, That this office of Christ, as an Advocate, differeth from that of a Priest.","That he is a Priest, a Priest for ever, I heartily acknowledge; but that his priesthood and advocateship should be one and the self-same office, I cannot believe.",1.,Because they differ in name.,"We may as well say a father, as such, is a son, or that father and son is the self-same relation, as say a priest and an advocate, as to office, are but one and the same thing.","They differ in name as much as priest and sacrifice do: a priest is one, and a sacrifice is another; and though Christ is Priest and Sacrifice too, yet, as a Priest, he is not a Sacrifice, nor, as a Sacrifice, a Priest.",2.,"As they differ in name, so they differ in the nature of office.","A priest is to slay a sacrifice; an advocate is to plead a cause; a priest is to offer his sacrifice, to the end that, by the merit thereof, he may appease; an advocate is to plead, to plead according to law; a priest is to make intercession, by virtue of his sacrifice; an advocate is to plead law, because amends is made.",3.,"As they differ in name and nature, so they also differ as to their extent.","The priesthood of Christ extendeth itself to the whole of God's elect, whether called or in their sins; but Christ, as Advocate, pleadeth only for the children.",4.,"As they differ in name, in nature, and extent, so they differ as to the persons with whom they have to do.","We read not anywhere that Christ, as Priest, has to do with the devil as an antagonist, but, as an Advocate, he hath.",5.,"As they differ in these, so they differ as to the matters about which they are employed.","Christ, as Priest, concerns himself with every wry thought, and, also, with the least imperfection or infirmity that attends our most holy things; but Christ, as Advocate, doth not so, as I have already showed.",6.,"So that Christ, as Priest, goes before, and Christ, as an Advocate, comes after; Christ, as Priest, continually intercedes; Christ, as Advocate, in case of great transgressions, pleads: Christ, as Priest, has need to act always, but Christ, as Advocate, sometimes only.","Christ, as Priest, acts in times of peace; but Christ, as Advocate, in times of broils, turmoils, and sharp contentions; wherefore, Christ, as Advocate, is, as I may call him, a reserve, and his time is then to arise, to stand up and plead, when HIS are clothed with some filthy sin that of late they have fallen into, as David, Joshua, or Peter.","When some such thing is committed by them, as ministereth to the enemy a show of ground to question the truth of their grace; or when it is a question, and to be debated, whether it can stand with the laws of heaven, with the merits of Christ, and the honour of God, that such a one should be saved.","Now let an advocate come forth, now let him have time to plead, for this is a fit occasion for the saints' Advocate to stand up to plead for the salvation of his people.","But, Second, I come next to show you how far this office of an Advocate is extended.","I hinted at this before, so now shall be the more brief.",1.,"By this office he offereth no sacrifice; he only, as to matter of justice, pleads the sacrifice offered.",2.,"By this office he obtains the conversion of none; he only thereby secureth the converted from the damnation which their adversary, for sins after light and profession, endeavoureth to bring them to.",3.,"By this office he prevents not temporal punishment, but by it he chiefly preserveth the soul from hell.",4.,"By this office he brings in no justifying righteousness for us, he only thereby prevaileth to have the dispose of that brought in by himself, as Priest, for the justifying of those, by a new and fresh act, who had made their justification doubtful by new falls into sin.","And this is plain in the history of our Joshua, so often mentioned before (Zech 3).",5.,"As Priest, he hath obtained eternal redemption for us; and as Advocate, he by law, maintaineth our right thereto, against the devil and his angels.","Third, I come now to show you who they are that have Jesus Christ for their Advocate.","And this I shall do-first, more generally, and then shall be more particular and distinct about it.",1.,More generally.,"They are all the truly gracious; those that are the children by adoption; and this the test affirmeth-""My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.","And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","They are, then, the children, by adoption, that are the persons concerned in the advocateship of Jesus Christ.","The priesthood of Christ extendeth itself to the whole body of the elect, but the advocateship of Christ doth not so.","This is further cleared by this apostle; and in this very text, if you consider what immediately follows-""We have an Advocate,"" says he, ""and he is the propitiation for our sins.""","He is our Advocate, and also our Priest.","As an Advocate, ours only; but as a propitiation, not ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world; to be sure, for the elect throughout the world, and they that will extend it further, let them.","And I say again, had he not intended that there should have been a straiter limit put to the Advocateship of Christ than he would have us put to his priestly office, what needed he, when he speaketh of the propitiation which relates to Christ as Priest, have added-""And not for ours only""?","As an Advocate, then, he engageth for us that are children; and as a Priest, too, he hath appeased God's wrath for our sins; but as an Advocate his offices are confined to the children only, but as a Priest he is not so.","He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only.","The sense, therefore, of the apostle should, I think, be this-That Christ, as a Priest, hath offered a propitiatory sacrifice for all; but as an Advocate he pleadeth only for the children.","Children, we have an Advocate to ourselves, and he is also our Priest; but as he is a Priest, he is not ours only, but maketh, as such, amends for all that shall be saved.","The elect, therefore, have the Lord Jesus for their Advocate then, and then only, when they are by calling put among the children; because, as Advocate, he is peculiarly the children's-""My little children, WE have an Advocate.""",Objection.,"But he also saith, ""If any man sin, we have an Advocate""; any man that sinneth seems, by the text, notwithstanding what you say, ""to have an Advocate with the Father.""",Answer.,"By any man, must not be meant any of the world, nor any of the elect, but any man in faith and grace; for he still limits this general term, ""any man,"" with this restriction, ""we""-Children, ""if any man sin, we have an Advocate.""","We, any man of us.","And this is yet further made appear, since he saith that it is to them he writes, not only here, but further in this chapter-""I write unto YOU, little children; I write unto you, fathers; I write unto you, young men"" (I John 2: 12,13).","These are the persons intended in the text, for under these three heads are comprehended all men; for they are either children, and so men in nature, or young men, and so men in strength; or else they are fathers, and so aged, and of experience.","Add to this, by ""any man,"" that the apostle intendeth not to enlarge himself beyond the persons that are in grace; but to supply what was wanting by that term ""little children""; for since the strongest saint may have heed of an Advocate, as well as the most feeble of the flock, why should the apostle leave it to be so understood as if the children, and the children only, had an interest in that office?","Wherefore, after he had said, ""My little children, I write unto you, that ye sin not""; he then adds, with enlargement, ""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father.""","Yet the little children may well be mentioned first, since they most want the knowledge of it, are most feeble, and so by sin may be forced most frequently to act faith on Christ, as Advocate.","Besides, they are most ready, through temptation, to question whether they have so good a right to Christ in all his offices as have better and more well-grown saints; and, therefore, they, in this the apostle's salutation, are first set down in the catalogue of names-""My little children, I write unto you, that ye sin not.","If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","So, then, the children of God are they who have the Lord Jesus, an Advocate for them with the Father.","The least and biggest, the oldest and youngest, the feeblest and the strongest; ALL the children have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.",(1.),"Since, then, the children have Christ for their advocate, art thou a child?",Art thou begotten of God by his Word?,(James 1:18).,Hast thou in thee the spirit of adoption?,(Gal 4:1-6).,"Canst thou in faith say, Father, Father, to God?","Then is Christ thy Advocate, thine Advocate, ""now to appear in the presence of God for thee"" (Heb 9:24).","To appear there, and to plead there, in the face of the court of heaven, for thee; to plead there against thine adversary, whose accusations are dreadful, whose subtlety is great, whose malice is inconceivable, and whose rage is intolerable; to plead there before a just God, a righteous God, a sin-revenging God: before whose face thou wouldst die if thou wast to show thyself, and at his bar to plead thine own cause.","But, (2.)","There is a difference in children; some are bigger than some; there are children and little children-""My little children, I write unto you.""","Little children; some of the little children can neither say Father, nor so much as know that they themselves are children.","This is true in nature, and so it is in grace; wherefore, notwithstanding what was said under the first head, it doth not follow, that if I be a child I must certainly know it, and also be able to call God, Father.","Let the first, then, serve to poise and balance the confident ones, and let this be for the relief of those more feeble; for they that are children, whether they know it or no, have Jesus Christ for their Advocate, for Christ is assigned to be our Advocate by the Judge, by the King, by our God and Father, although we have not known it.","True, at present, there can come from hence, to them that are thus concerned in the advocateship of Christ, but little comfort; but yet it yields them great security; they have ""an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","God knows this, the devil feels this, and the children shall have the comfort of it afterwards.","I say, the time is coming when they shall know that even then, when they knew it not, they had an Advocate with the Father; an Advocate who was neither loath, nor afraid, nor ashamed, to plead for their defense against their proudest foe.","And will not this, when they know it, yield them comfort?","Doubtless it will; yea, more, and of a better kind, than that which flows from the knowledge that one is born to crowns and kingdoms.","Again; as he is an Advocate for the children, so he is also, as before was hinted, for the strong and experienced; for no strength in this world secureth from the rage of hell; nor can any experience, while we are here, fortify us against his assaults.","There is also an incidency in the best to sin; and the bigger man, the bigger fall; for the more hurt, the greater damage.",Wherefore it is of absolute necessity that an advocate be provided for the strong as for the weak.,"""Any man""; he that is most holy, most reformed, most refined, and most purified, may as soon be in the dirt as the weakest Christian; and, so far as I can see, Satan's design is against them most.",I am sure the greatest sins have been committed by the biggest saints.,"This wayfaring man came to David's house, and when he stood up against Israel, he provoked David to number the people (II Sam 12:4,7; I Chron 21:1).",Wherefore they have as much need of an advocate as have the youngest and most feeble of the flock.,What a mind had he to try a fall with Peter!,And how quickly did he break the neck of Judas!,"The like, without doubt, he had done to Peter, had not Jesus, by stepping in, prevented.","As long as sin is in our flesh, there is danger.","Indeed, he saith of the young men that they are strong, and that they have overcome the wicked one; but he doth not say they have killed him.","As long as the devil is alive there is danger; and though a strong Christian may be too hard for, and may overcome him in one thing, he may be too hard for, yea, and may overcome him two for one afterwards.","Thus he served David, and thus he served Peter, and thus he, in our day, has served many more.","The strongest are weak, the wisest are fools, when suffered to be sifted as wheat in Satan's sieve; yea, and have often been so proved, to the wounding of their great hearts, and the dishonour of religion.","To conclude this: God of his mercy hath sufficiently declared the truth of what I say, by preparing for the best, the strongest, and most sanctified, as well as for the least, weakest, and most feeble saint, as Advocate-""My little children, I write unto you, that ye sin not.","And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""",2.,"But some may object, that what has been said as to discovering for whom Christ is an Advocate has been too general, and, therefore, would have me come more to particulars, else they can get no comfort.","Well, inquiring soul, so I will; and, therefore, hearken to what I say.",(1.),Wouldest thou know whether Christ is thine Advocate or no?,"I ask, Hast thou entertained him so to be?","When men have suits of law depending in any of the king's courts above, they entertain their attorney or advocate to plead their cause, and so he pleads for them.","I say, hast thou entertained Jesus Christ for thy lawyer to plead thy cause?","""Plead my cause, O Lord,"" said David (Psa 35:1); and again, ""Judge me, O God, and plead my cause"" (Psa 43:1).","This, therefore, is the first thing that I would propound to thee: Hast thou, with David, entertained him for thy lawyer, or, with good Hezekiah, cried out, ""O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me"" (Isa 38:14).","What sayest thou, soul?","Hast thou been with him, and prayed him to plead thy cause, and cried unto him to undertake for thee?","This I call entertaining of him to be thy advocate, and I choose to follow the similitude, both because the Scripture seems to smile upon such a way of discourse, and because thy question doth naturally lead me to it.","Wherefore, I ask again, hast thou been with him?",Hast thou entertained him?,Hast thou desired him to plead thy cause?,Question.,"Thou wilt say unto me, How should I know that I have done so?",Answer.,"I answer, Art thou sensible that thou hast an action commenced against thee in that high court of justice that is above?","I say, Art thou sensible of this?","For the defendants-and all God's people are defendants-do not use to entertain their lawyers, but from knowledge, that an action either is, or may be, commenced against them before the God of heaven.","If thou sayest yea, then I ask, Who told thee that thou standest accused for transgression before the judgment-seat of God?","I say, Who told thee so?","Hath the Holy Ghost, hath the world, or hath thy conscience?","For nothing else, as I know of, can bring such tidings to thy soul.",Again; Hast thou found a failure in all others that might have been entertained to plead thy cause?,"Some make their sighs, their tears, their prayers, and their reformations, their advocates-""Hast thou tried these, and found them wanting?""","Hast thou seen thy state to be desperate, if the Lord Jesus doth not undertake to plead thy cause?",for Jesus is not entertained so long as men can make shift without him.,"But when it comes to this point I perish for ever, notwithstanding the help of all, if the Lord Jesus steps not in.","Then Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, good Lord Jesus!",undertake for me.,"Hast thou therefore been with Jesus Christ as concerned in thy soul, as heartily concerned about the action that thou perceivest to be commenced against thee?",Question.,"You will say, How should I know that?",Answer.,"I answer, Hast thou well considered the nature of the crime wherewith thou standest charged at the bar of God?",Hast thou also considered the justness of the Judge?,"Again I ask, Hast thou considered what truth, as to matter of fact, there is in the things whereof thou standest accused?","Also, Hast thou considered the cunning, the malice, and diligence of thy adversary, with the greatness of the loss thou art like to sustain, shouldst thou with Ahab, in the book of Kings, (I Kings 22:17-23), or with the hypocrites in Isaiah, (Isa 6:5-10), have the verdict of the Lord God go out from the throne against thee?","I ask thee these questions, because if thou art in the knowledge of these things to seek, or if thou art not deeply concerned about the greatness of the damage that will certainly overtake thee, and that for ever, shouldest thou be indeed accused before God, and have none to plead thy cause, thou hast not, nor canst not, let what will come upon thee, have been with Jesus Christ to plead thy cause; and so, let thy case be never so desperate, thou standest alone, and hast no helper (Job 30:13, 9:13) Or if thou hast, they, not being the advocate of God's appointing, must needs fall with thee, and with thy burden.","Wherefore, consider of this seriously, and return thy answer to God, who can tell if truth shall be found in thy answers, better by far than any; for it is he that tries the reins and the heart, and therefore to him I refer thee.","But, (2.)",Wouldst thou know whether Jesus Christ is thine advocate?,"Then I ask again, Hast thou revealed thy cause unto him?-I say, Hast thou revealed thy cause unto him?","For he that goeth to law for his right, must not only go to a lawyer, and say, Sir, I am in trouble, and am to have a trial at law with mine enemy, pray undertake my cause; but he must also reveal to his lawyer his cause.","He must go to him and tell him what is the matter, how things stand, where the shoe pinches, and so.","Thus did the church of old, and thus doth every true Christian now; for though nothing can be hid from him, yet he will have things out of thine own mouth; he will have thee to reveal thy matters unto him (Matt 20:32).","""O Lord of hosts,"" said Jeremiah, ""that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause"" (Jer 11:20).","And again; ""But, O Lord of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I opened my cause"" (Jer 20:12).","Seest thou here, how saints of old were wont to do?","how they did, not only in a general way, entreat Christ to plead their cause, but in a particular way, go to him and reveal, or open their cause unto him?",O!,"it is excellent to behold how some sinners will do this when they get Christ and themselves in a closet alone; when they, upon their bare knees, are pouring out of their souls before him; or, like the woman in the gospel, telling him all the truth (Mark 5).",O!,"saith the soul, Lord, I am come to thee upon an earnest business; I am arrested by Satan; the bailiff was mine own conscience, and I am like to be accused before the judgment-seat of God.",My salvation lies at stake; I am questioned for my interest in heaven; I am afraid of the Judge; my heart condemns me (I John 3:20).,"Mine enemy is subtle, and wanteth not malice to prosecute me to death, and then to hell.","Also, Lord, I am sensible that the law is against me, for indeed I have horribly sinned, and thus and thus have I done.","Here I lie open to law, and there I lie open to law; here I have given the adversary advantage, and there he will surely have a hank11 against me.","Lord, I am distressed, undertake for me!","And there are some things that thou must be acquainted with about thine Advocate, before thou wilt venture to go thus far with him.","As, (a.)","Thou must know him to be a friend, and not an enemy, unto whom thou openest thy heart; and until thou comest to know that Christ is a friend to thee, or to souls in thy condition, thou wilt never reveal thy cause unto him, not thy whole cause unto him.","And it is from this that so many that have soul causes hourly depending before the throne of God, and that are in danger every day of eternal damnation, forbear to entertain Jesus Christ for their Advocate, and so wickedly conceal their matters from him; but ""he that hideth his sins shall not prosper"" (Prov 28:13) FOOTNOTE: Quoted from the Genevan, or Puritan translation.-ED.","This, therefore, must first be believed by thee before thou wilt reveal thy cause unto him.",(b.),"A man, when his estate is called in question, I mean his right and title thereto, will be very cautious, especially if he also questions his title to it himself, unto whom he reveals that affair; he must know him to be one that is not only friendly, but faithful, to whom he reveals such a secret as this.","Why, thus it is with Christ and the soul.","If the soul is not somewhat persuaded of the faithfulness of Christ-to wit, that if he can do him no good, he will do him no harm, he will never reveal his cause unto him, but will seek to hide his counsel from the Lord.","This, therefore, is another thing by which thou mayest know that thou hast Christ for thine Advocate, if thou hast heartily and in very deed revealed thy cause unto him.","Now, they that do honestly reveal their cause to their lawyer, will endeavour to possess him, as I hinted before, with the worst; they will, with words, make it as bad as they may; for, think they, by that means I shall prepare him for the worst that mine enemy can do.","And thus souls deal with Jesus Christ; see Psalms 51 and 38, with several others that might be named, and see if God's people have not done so.","""I said,"" saith David, ""I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.""","But, (3.)",Hast thou Jesus Christ for thine Advocate?,or wouldst thou know if thou hast?,"Then I ask again, Hast thou committed thy cause to him?","When a man entertains12 his lawyer to stand for him and to plead his cause, he doth not only reveal, but commit his cause unto him.","""I would seek unto God,"" says Eliphaz to Job, ""and unto God would I commit my cause"" (Job 5:8).",Now there is a difference betwixt revealing my cause and committing of it to a man.,To reveal my cause is to open it to one; and to commit it to him is to trust it in his hand.,"Many a man will reveal his cause to him unto whom he will yet be afraid to commit it; but now, he that entertains a lawyer to plead his cause, doth not only reveal but commit his cause into him.","As, suppose right to his estate be called in question; why, then, he not only reveals his cause to his lawyer, but puts into his hands his evidences, deeds, leases, mortgages, bonds, or what else he hath, to show a title to his estate by.","And thus doth Christians deal with Christ; they deliver up all unto him-to wit, all their signs, evidences, promises, and assurances, which they have thought they had for heaven and the salvation of their souls, and have desired him to peruse, to search, and try them every one.","""And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting"" (Psa 139:23-24).","This is committing of thy cause to Christ, and this is the hardest task of all, for the man that doth thus, he trusteth Christ with all; and it implieth, that he will live and die, stand and fall, lose and win, according as Christ will manage his business.","Thus did Paul, (II Tim 1:12), and thus Peter admonishes us to do.","Now he that doth this must be convinced, (a.)",Of the ability of Jesus Christ to defend him; for a man will not commit so great a concern as his all is to his friend.,"No; not to his friend, be he never so faithful, if he perceives not in him ability to save him, and to preserve what he hath, against all the cavils of an enemy.","And hence it is that the ability of Jesus Christ, as to the saving of his people, is so much insisted on in the Scripture; as, ""I have laid help upon one that is mighty"" (Psa 89:19).","""I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save"" (Isa 63:1).","And again, ""He shall send them a Saviour, and a great one"" (Isa 19:20).",(b.),"As they must be convinced of his ability to help them, so they must of his courage; a man that has parts sufficient may yet fail his friend for want of courage; wherefore, the courage and greatness of Christ's Spirit, as to his undertaking of the cause of his people, is also amply set out in Scripture.","""He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth,"" ""till he send forth judgment unto victory"" (Isa 42:4; Matt 12:20).","(c.) They must also be convinced of his willingness to do this for them; for though one be able and of courage sufficient, yet if he is not willing to undertake one's cause, what is it the better?","Wherefore, he declareth his willingness also, and how ready he is to stand up to plead the cause of the poor and of them that are in want.","""The Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them"" (Prov 22:23).","(d.) They must also be convinced of this-that Christ is tender, and will not be offended at the dullness of his client.","Some men can reveal their cause to their lawyers better than some, and are more serviceable and handy in that affair than others.","But, saith the Christian, I am dull and stupid that way, will not Christ be shuff13 and shy with me because of this?",Honest heart!,"He hath a supply of thy defects14 in himself, and knoweth what thou wantest, and where the shoe pinches, though thou art not able distinctly to open matters to him.","The child is pricked with a pin, and lies crying in the mother's lap, but cannot show its mother where the pin is; but there is pity enough in the mother to supply this defect of the child; wherefore she undresses it, opens it, searches every clout from head to the foot of the child, and so finds where the pin is.","Thus will thy lawyer do; he will search and find out thy difficulties, and where Satan seeketh an advantage of thee, accordingly will provide his remedy.","(e.) O, but will he not be weary?","The prophet complains of some, ""that they weary God"" (Isa 7:13).","And mine is a very cross and intricate cause; I have wearied many a good man while I have been telling my tale unto him, and I am afraid that I shall also weary Jesus Christ.",Answer.,"Soul, he suffered and did bear with the manners of Israel forty years in the wilderness; and hast thou tried him half so long?",(Acts 13:18).,"The good souls that have gone before thee have found him ""a tried stone,"" a sure one to be trusted to as to this (Isa 28:16).","And the prophet saith positively that ""he fainteth not, neither is weary""; and that ""there is no searching of his understanding"" (Isa 40:28).","Let all these things prevail with thee to believe, that if thou hast committed by cause unto him, he will bring it to pass, to a good pass, to so good a pass as will glorify God, honour Christ, save thee, and shame the devil.","But, (4.)","Wouldst thou know whether Jesus Christ is thine Advocate, whether he has taken in hand to plead thy cause?","Then, I ask, dost thou, together with what has been mentioned before, wait upon him according to his counsel, until things shall come to a legal issue?",Thus must clients do.,"There is a great many turnings and windings about suits and trials at law; the enemy, also, with his supersedeas15 cavils, and motions, often defers a speedy issue; wherefore, the man whose is the concern must wait; as the prophet said, ""I will look,"" said he, ""unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation.""","But how long, prophet, wilt thou wait?","Why, says he, ""until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me"" (Micah 7:7-10).","Perhaps when thy cause is tried, things for the present are upon this issue; thy adversary, indeed, is cast, but whether thou shalt have an absolute discharge, as Peter had, or a conditional one, as David, and as the Corinthians had, that is the question (II Sam 12:10-14).","True, thou shalt be completely saved at last; but yet whether it is not best to leave to thee a memento of God's displeasure against thy sin, by awarding that the sword shall never depart from thy house, or that some sore sickness or other distresses shall haunt thee as long as thou livest, or, perhaps, that thou shalt walk without the light of God's countenance for several years and a day.","Now, if any of these three things happen unto thee, thou must exercise patience, and wait; thus did David-""I waited patiently""; and again he exercises his soul in this virtue, saying ""My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him"" (Psa 62:5).","For now we are judged of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.","And by this judgment, though it sets us free from their damnation, yet we are involved in many troubles, and, perhaps, must wait many a day before we can know that, as to the main, the verdict hath gone on our side.","Thus, therefore, in order to thy waiting upon him without fainting, it is meet that thou shouldest know the methods of him that manages thy cause for thee in heaven; and suffer not mistrust to break in and bear sway in thy soul, for ""he will"" at length ""bring thee forth to the light, and thou shalt behold his righteousness.","She, also, that is thine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which saith unto thee, Where is the Lord thy God?""",(Micah 7: 9-10).,Question.,But what is it to wait upon him according to his counsel?,Answer.,(a.),"To wait is to be of good courage, to live in expectation, and to look for deliverance, though thou hast sinned against thy God.","""Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart; wait, I say, on the Lord"" (Psa 27:14).",(b.),"To wait upon him is to keep his way, to walk humbly in his appointments.","""Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land"" (Psa 37:34).","(c.) To wait upon him is to observe and keep those directions which he giveth thee; to observe even while he stands up to plead thy cause; for without this, or not doing this, a man may mar his cause in the hand of him that is to plead it; wherefore, keep thee far from an evil matter, have no correspondence with thine enemy, walk humbly for the wickedness thou hast committed, and loathe and abhor thyself for it, in dust and ashes.",To these things doth the Scripture everywhere direct us.,"(d.) To wait, is also to incline, to hearken to those further directions which thou mayest receive from the mouth of thine advocate, as to any fresh matters that may forward and expedite a good issue of thine affair in the court of heaven.",The want of this was the reason that the deliverance of Israel did linger so long in former times.,"""O,"" says he, ""that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!","I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.","The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto him; but their time should have endured for ever"" (Psa 81:13-15).","(e.) Also, if it tarry long, wait for it.",Do not conclude that thy cause is lost because at present thou dost not hear from court.,"Cry, if thou wilt, O, when wilt thou come unto me?","But never let such a wicked thought pass through thy heart, saying, ""This evil is of the Lord; what should I wait for the Lord any longer?""",(II Kings 6:33).,(f.) But take heed that thou turnest not thy waiting into sleeping.,"Wait thou must, and wait patiently too; but yet wait with much longing and earnestness of spirit, to see or hear how matters go above.","You may observe, that when a man that dwells far down in the country, and has some business at the term, in this or another of the king's courts, though he will wait his lawyer's time and convenience, yet he will so wait as still to inquire at the post house, or at the carrier's, or if a neighbour comes down from term, at his mouth, for letters, or any other intelligence, if possibly he may arrive to know how his cause speeds, and whether his adversary, or he, has the day.","Thus, I say, thou must wait upon thine Advocate.","His ordinances are his post house, his ministers are his carriers, where tidings from heaven are to be had, and where those that are sued in that court by the devil may, at one time or another, hear from their lawyer, their advocate, how things are like to go.","Wherefore, I say, wait at the posts of wisdom's house, go to ordinances with expectation to hear from thy Advocate there; for he will send in due time; ""though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry"" (Hab 2:1-3).","And now, soul, I have answered thy request, and let me hear what thou sayest unto me.","Soul.-Truly, says the soul, methinks that by what you have said, I may have this blessed Jesus to be mine Advocate; for I think, verily, I have entertained him to be mine Advocate.","I have also revealed my cause unto him, yea, committed both it and myself unto him; and, as you say, I wait; oh!",I wait!,and my eyes fail with looking upward.,"Fain would I hear how my soul standeth in the sight of God, and whether my sins, which I have committed since light and grace were given unto me, be by mine Advocate, taken out of the hand of the devil, and by mine Advocate removed as far from me as the ends of the earth are asunder; whether the verdict has gone on my side, and what a shout there was among the angels when they saw it went well with me!",But alas!,"I have waited, and that a long time, and have, as you advise, run from ordinance to minister, and from minister to ordinance, or, as you phrase it, from the post to the carrier, and from the carrier to the post house, to see if I could hear aught from heaven how matters went about my soul there.","I have also asked those that pass by the way, ""if they saw him whom my soul loveth,"" and if they had anything to communicate to me?","But nothing can I get or find but generals; as, that I have an Advocate there, and that he pleadeth the cause of his people, and that he will thoroughly plead their cause.","But what he has done for ME, of that as yet I am ignorant.","I doubt if my soul shall by him be effectually secured, that yet a conditional verdict will be awarded concerning me, and that much bitter will be mixed with my sweet, and that I must drink gall and wormwood for my folly; for if David, and Asa, and Hezekiah and such good men, were so served for their sins, (II Chron 16:7,12), why should I look for other dealing at the hand of God?","But as to this, I will endeavour to ""bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him,"" (Micah 7:9), and shall count it an infinite mercy, if this judgment comes to me from him, that I may ""not be condemned with the world"" (I Cor 11:32).","I know it is dreadful walking in darkness; but if that also shall be the Lord's lot upon me; I pray God I may have faith enough to stay upon him till death, and then will the clouds blow over, and I shall see him in the light of the living.","Mine, enemy, the devil, as you see, is of an inveigling temper; and though he has accused my before the judgment-seat of God, yet when he comes to me at any time, he glavers16 and flatters as if he never did mean me harm; but I think it is that he might get further advantage against me.","But I carry it now at a greater distance than formerly; and O that I was at the remotest distance, not only from him, but also from that self of mine, that laboureth with him for my undoing!","But although I say these things now, and to you, yet I have my solitary hours, and in them I have other strange thoughts; for thus I think, my cause is bad, I have sinned, and I have been vile.","I am ashamed myself of mine own doings, and have given mine enemy the best end of the staff.","The law, and reason, and my conscience, plead for him against me, and all is true; he puts into his charge against me, that I have sinned more times than there be hairs on my head.","I know not anything that ever I did in my life but it had flaw, or wrinkle, or spot, or some such thing in it.","Mine eyes have seen vileness in the best of my doings; what, then, think you, must God needs see in them?","Nor can I do anything yet, for all I know that I am accused by my enemy before the judgment-seat of God, better than what already is imperfect.","""I lie down in my shame, and my confusion covers my face.""","""I have sinned, what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men"" (Jer 3:25, Job 7:20).","Reply.-Well, soul, I have heard what thou hast said, and if all be true which thou hast said, it is good, and gives me ground of hope that Jesus Christ is become thine Advocate; and if that be so, no doubt but thy trial will come to a good conclusion.","And be not afraid because of the holiness of God; for thine Advocate has this for his advantage, that he pleads before a judge that is just, and against an enemy that is unholy and rejected.",Nor let the thoughts of the badness of thy cause terrify thee overmuch.,"Cause thou hast indeed to be humble, and thou dost well to cover thy face with shame; and it is no matter how base and vile thou art in thine own eyes, provided that it comes not by renewed acts of rebellion, but through a spiritual sight of thine imperfections.",Only let me advise thee here to stop.,"Let not thy shame nor thy self-abasing apprehension of thyself, drive thee from the firm and permanent ground of hope, which is the promise, and the doctrine of an Advocate with the Father.","No; let not the apprehension of the badness of thy cause do it, forasmuch as he did never yet take cause in hand that was good, perfectly good of itself; and his excellency is, to make a man stand that has a bad cause; yea, he can make a bad cause good, in a way of justice and righteousness.",[THE PRIVILEGES OF THOSE WHO HAVE CHRIST FOR AN ADVOCATE.],"FOURTHLY, And for thy further encouragement in this matter, I will here bring in the fourth chief head-to wit, to show what excellent privilege (I mean over and above what has already been spoken of) they have that are made partakers of the benefit of this office:-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""",First Privilege.,"Thy Advocate pleads to a price paid, to a propitiation made; and this is a great advantage; yea, he pleads to a satisfaction made for all wrongs done, or to be done, by his elect-""For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified"" (Heb 10:10,14; 9:26).","""By one offering""-that is, by the offering of himself-by one offering once offered, once offered in the end of the world.","This, I say, thine Advocate pleads.","When Satan brings in fresh accusations for more transgressions against the law of God, he forces not Christ to shift his first plea.","I say, he puts him not to his shifts at all; for the price once paid hath in it sufficient value, would God impute it to that end, to take away the sin of the whole world.","There is a man that hath brethren; he is rich, and they are poor (and this is the case betwixt Christ and us), and the rich brother goeth to his father, and saith, Thou art related to my brethren with me, and out of my store, I pray thee, let them have sufficient, and for thy satisfaction I will put into thy hand the whole of what I have, which perhaps is worth an hundred thousand pounds by the year; and this other sum I also give, that they be not disinherited.","Now, will not this last his poor brethren to spend upon a great while?",But Christ's worth can never be drawn dry.,"Now, set the case again, that some ill-conditioned man should take notice that these poor men live all upon the spend (and saints do so), and should come to the good man's house, and complain to him of the spending of his sons, and that while their elder brother stands by, what do you think the elder brother would reply, if he was as good-natured as Christ?","Why, he would say, I have yet with my father in store for my brethren, wherefore then seekest thou to stop his hand?","As he is just, he must give them for their convenience; yea, and as for their extravagances, I have satisfied for them so well, that, however he afflicteth them, he will not disinherit them.","I hope you will read and hear this, not like them that say, ""Let us do evil that good may come,"" but like those whom the love of Christ constrains to be better.","However, this is the children's bread, that which they have need of, and without which they cannot live; and they must have it, though Satan should put pins into it, therewith to choke the dogs.17 And for the further clearing of this, I will present you with these few considerations: 1.","Those that are most sanctified have yet a body of sin and death in them, and so also it will be, while they continue in this world (Rom 7:24).",2.,"This body of sin strives to break out, and will break out, to the polluting of the conversation, if saints be not the more watchful (Rom 6:12).","Yea, it has broken out in a most sad manner, and that in the strongest saints (Gal 5:17).",3.,Christ offereth no new sacrifice for the salvation of these his people.,"""For, being raised from the dead, he dieth no more"" (Rom 6:9).","So then, if saints sin, they must be saved, if saved at all, by virtue of the offering already offered; and if so, then all Christ's pleas, as an Advocate, are grounded upon that one offering which before, as a Priest, he presented God with, for the taking away of sin.","So then, Christians live upon this old stock; their transgressions are forgiven for the sake of the worth, that yet God finds in the offering that Christ hath offered.","And all Christ's pleadings, as an Advocate, are grounded upon the sufficiency and worth of that one sacrifice; I mean, all his pleadings with his Father, as to the charge which the accuser brings in against them.","For though thou art a man of infirmity, and so incident to nothing [so much] as to stumble and fall, if grace doth not prevent, and it doth not always prevent; yet the value and worth of the price that was once paid for thee is not yet worn out; and Christ, as an Advocate, still pleadeth, as occasion is given, that, with success, to thy salvation.","And this privilege they have, who indeed have Christ for their Advocate; and I put it here, in the first place, because all other do depend upon it.",Second Privilege.,"Thine Advocate, as he pleadeth a price already paid, so, and therefore, he pleads for himself as for thee.","We are all concerned in one bottom; if he sinks, we sink; if we sink, he sinks.",18 Give me leave to make out my meaning.,1.,Christ pleads the value and virtue of the price of his blood and sacrifice for us.,"And admit of this horrible supposition a little, for argument's sake, that though Christ pleads the worth of what, as Priest, he offereth, yet the soul for whom he so pleads perishes eternally.","Now, where lieth the fault?","In sin, you say: true; but it is because there was more virtue in sin to damn, than there was in the blood pleaded by Christ to save; for he pleaded his merit, he put it into the balance against sin; but sin hath weighed down the soul of the sinner to hell, notwithstanding the weight of merit that he did put in against it.","Now, what is the result, but that the Advocate goes down, as well as we; we to hell, and he in esteem?","Wherefore, I say, he is concerned with us; his credit, his honour, his glory and renown, flies all away, if those for whom he pleads as an Advocate perish for want of worth in his sacrifice pleaded.",But shall this ever be said of Christ?,"Or will it be found that any, for whom Christ as Advocate pleads, yet perish for want of worth in the price, or of neglect in the Advocate to plead it?","No, no; himself is concerned, and that as to his own reputation and honour, and as to the value and virtue of his blood; nor will he lose these for want of pleading for them concerned in this office.",2.,"I argue again; Christ, as Advocate, must needs be concerned in his plea; for that every one, for whose salvation he advocates, is his own; so, then, if he loses, he loses his own-his substance and inheritance.","Thus, if he lose the whole, and if he lose a part, one, any one of his own, he loseth part of his all, and of his fullness; wherefore we may well think, that Christ, as Advocate, is concerned, even concerned with his people, and therefore will thoroughly plead their cause.","Suppose a man should have a horse, though lame, and a piece of ground, though somewhat barren, yet if any should attempt to take these away, he would not sit still, and so lose his own; no, saith he, ""since they are mine own, they shall cost me five times more than they are worth, but I will maintain my right.""","I have seen men sometimes strongly engaged in law for that which, when considered by itself, one would think was not worth regarding; but when I have asked them, why so concerned for a thing of so little esteem, they have answered, O, it is some of that by which I hold a title of honour, or my right to a greater income, and therefore I will not lose it.","Why, thus is Christ engaged; what he pleads for is his own, his all, his fullness; yea, it is that by which he holds his royalty, for he is ""King of saints"" (Rev 15:3, John 6:37-39, Psa 16:5,6).","It is part of his estate, and that by which he holds some of his titles of honour (Eph 5:23, Jer 50:34, Rom 11:26, Heb 2:10).","Saviour, Redeemer, Deliverer, and Captain, are some of his titles of honour; but if he loseth any of those, upon whose account he weareth those titles of honour, for want of virtue in his plea, or for want of worth in his blood, he loseth his own, and not only so, but part of his royalty, and does also diminish and lay a blot upon his glorious titles of honour; and he is jealous of his honour; his honour he will not give to another.","Wherefore he will not, be not afraid, he never will leave nor forsake those who have given themselves unto him, and for whom he is become an Advocate with the Father, to plead their cause; even because thou art one, one of his own, one by whom he holdeth his glorious titles of honour.",Objection.,"O, but I am but one, and a very sorry one, too; and what is one, especially such an one as I am?",Can there be a miss of the loss of such an one?,Answer.,"One and one makes two, and so ad infinitum.","Christ cannot lose one, but as he may lose more, and so, in conclusion, lose all: but of all that God has given him, he will lose nothing (John 6:38,39).","Besides, to lose one would encourage Satan, disparage his own wisdom, make him incapable of giving in, at the day of account, the whole tale19 to God of those that he has given him.","Further, this would dishearten sinners, and make them afraid of venturing their cause and their souls in his hand; and would, as I said before, either prove his propitiation in some sense ineffectual, or else himself defective in his pleading on it; but none of these things must be supposed.","He will thoroughly plead the cause of his people, execute judgment for them, bring them out to the light, and cause them to behold his righteousness (Micah 7:9).",Third Privilege.,"The plea of Satan is groundless, and that is another privilege: for albeit thou hast sinned, yet since Christ before has paid thy debt, and also paid for more; since thou hast not yet run beyond the price of thy redemption; it must be concluded that Satan wants a good bottom to ground his plea upon, and therefore must, in conclusion, fail of his design.","True, there is sin committed, there is a law transgressed, but there is also a satisfaction for this transgression, and that which superabounds; so, though there be sin, yet there wants a foundation for a plea.","Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, but Christ had other garments provided for him, change of raiment: wherefore iniquity, as to the charge of Satan, vanishes.","""And the angel answered and said, Take away the filthy garments from him"" [this intimates that there was no ground, no sufficient ground, for Satan's charge]; ""and unto him he said, Behold I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment"" (Zech 3:4).","20 Now, if there be no ground, no sound and sufficient ground, to build a charge against the child upon, I mean, as to eternal condemnation; for that is the thing contended for; then, as I said, Satan must fall ""like lightning to the ground,"" and be cast over the bar, as a corrupt and illegal pleader.","But this is so, as in part is proved already, and will be further made out by that which follows.","They that have indeed Christ to be their Advocate, are themselves, by virtue of another law than that against which they have sinned, secured from the charge that Satan brings in against them.","I granted before, that the child of God has sinned, and that there is a law that condemneth for this sin; but here is the thing, this child is removed by an act of grace into and under another law: ""For we are not under the law,"" and so, consequently, ""there is now no condemnation for them"" (Rom 6:14, 8:1).","Wherefore, when God speaketh of his dealing with his, he saith, It shall ""not be by their covenant,"" that is, not by that of the law, they then being not under the law (Eze 16:61).","What if a plea be commenced against them, a plea for sin, and they have committed sin; a plea grounded upon the law, and the law takes cognizance of their sin?","Yet, I say, the plea wants a good bottom, for that the person thus accused is put under another law; hence, he says, ""Sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law.""","If the child was under the law, Satan's charge would be good, because it would have a substantial ground of support; but since the child is dead to the law, (Gal 2:19), and that also dead to him, for both are true as to condemnation, (Rom 7:6), how can it be that Satan should have a sufficient ground for his charge, though he should have matter of fact, sufficient matter of fact, that is sin?","For by his change of relation, he is put out of the reach of that law.","There is a woman, a widow, that oweth a sum of money, and she is threatened to be sued for the debt; now what doth she but marrieth; so, when the action is commenced against her as a widow, the law finds her a married woman; what now can be done?","Nothing to her; she is not who she was; she is delivered from that state by her marriage; if anything be done, it must be done to her husband.","But if Satan will sue Christ for my debt, he oweth him nothing; and as for what the law can claim of me while I was under it, Christ has delivered me by redemption from that curse, ""being made a curse for me"" (Gal 3:13).","Now the covenant into which I am brought by grace, by which also I am secured from the law, is not a law of sin and death, as that is from under which I am brought, (Rom 8:2), but a law of grace and life; so that Satan cannot come at me by that law; and by grace, I am by that secured also from the hand, and mouth, and sting of all other; I mean still, as to an eternal concern.","Wherefore God saith, ""If we break his law, the law of works, he will visit our sin with a rod, and our iniquity with stripes; but his covenant, his new covenant, will he not break,"" but will still keep close to that, and so secure us from eternal condemnation (Psa 89:30-37).","Christ also is made the mediator of that covenant, and therefore an Advocate by that; for his priestly office and advocateship are included by his mediation; wherefore when Satan pleads by the old, Christ pleads by the new covenant, for the sake of which the old one is removed.","""In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old.","Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away"" (Heb 8:13).","So, then, the ground of plea is with Jesus Christ, and not with our accuser.","Now, what doth Christ plead, and what is the ground of his plea?","Why, he pleads for exemption and freedom from condemnation, though by the law of works his children have deserved it; and the ground for this his plea, as to law, is the matter of the covenant itself, for thus it runs: ""For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more"" (Heb 8:12).","Now here is a foundation-a foundation in law, for our Advocate to build his plea upon; a foundation in a law not to be moved, or removed, or made to give place, as that is forced to do, upon which Satan grounds his plea against us.","Men, when they plead before a judge, use to plead matter of law.","Now, suppose there is an old law in the realm, by which men deserve to be condemned to death, and there is a new law in this realm that secureth men from that condemnation which belongs to them by the old; and suppose also, that I am completely comprehended by all the provisos of the new law, and not by any tittle thereof excluded from a share therein; and suppose, again, that I have a brangling adversary that pursues me by the old law, which yet cannot in right touch me, because I am interested in the new; my advocate also is one that pleads by the new law, where only there is a ground of plea; shall not now mine adversary feel the power of his plea to the delivering of me, and the putting of him to shame?","Yes, verily; especially since the plea is good, the judge just; nor can the enemy find any ground for a demur21 to be put in against my present discharge in open court, and that by proclamation; especially since my Advocate has also, by his blood, fully satisfied the old law, that he might establish the new (Heb 10: 9, 11, 12).",Fourth Privilege.,"Since that which goeth before is true, it follows, that he that entereth his plea against the children must needs be overthrown; for always before just judges it is the right that taketh place.","Judge the right, O Lord, said David; or, ""let my sentence come forth from thy presence,"" according to the law of grace.","And he that knows what strong ground, or bottom, our Advocate has for his pleadings, and how Satan's accusations are without sound foundation, will not be afraid, he speaking in Christ, to say, I appeal to God Almighty, since Christ is my Advocate by the new law, whether I ought to be condemned to death and hell for what Satan pleads against me by the old.","Satan urgeth that we have sinned, but Christ pleads to his propitiatory sacrifice; and so Satan is overthrown.","Satan pleads the law of works, but Christ pleads the law of grace.","Further, Satan pleads the justice and holiness of God against us; and there the accuser is overthrown again.","And to them Christ appeals, and his appeal is good, since the law testifies to the sufficiency of the satisfaction that Christ has made thereto by his obedience (Rom 3:22, 23).","And also, since by another covenant, God himself has given us to Jesus Christ, and so delivered us from the old.","Wherefore you read nothing as an effect of Satan's pleading against us, but that his mouth is stopped, as appears by Zechariah 3; and that he is cast; yea, cast down, as you have it in Revelation 12.","Indeed, when God admits not, when Christ wills not to be an Advocate, and when Satan is bid stand at the right hand of one accused, to enforce, by pleading against him, the things charged on him by the law, then he can prevail-prevail for ever against such a wretched one (Psa 109: 6, 7).","But when Christ stands up to plead, when Christ espouses this or that man's cause, then Satan must retreat, then he must go down.","And this necessarily flows from the text, ""We have an Advocate,"" a prevailing one, one that never lost cause, one that always puts the children's enemy to the rout before the judgment-seat of God.","22 This, therefore, is another privilege that they have, who have Jesus Christ for their Advocate; their enemy must needs be overthrown, because both law and justice are on their side.",Fifth Privilege.,"Thine advocate has pity for thee, and great indignation against thine accuser: and these are two excellent things.","When a lawyer hath pity for a man whose cause he pleadeth, it will engage him much; but when he has indignation also against the man's accuser, this will yet engage him more.","Now, Christ has both these, and that not of humour, but by grace and justice; grace to us, and justice to our accuser.","He came down from heaven that he might be a Priest, and returned thither again to be Priest and Advocate for his; and in both these offices he levelleth his whole force and power against thine accuser: ""For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil"" (I John 3:8).","Cunning men will, if they can, retain such an one to be their Advocate, who has a particular quarrel against their adversary; for thus, think they, he that is such, will not only plead for me, but for himself, and to right his own wrongs also; and since, if it be so, and it is so here, my concerns and my Advocate's are interwoven, I am like to fare much the better for the anger that is conceived in his heart against him.","And this, I say, is the children's case; their Advocate counteth their accuser his greatest enemy, and waiteth for a time to take vengeance, and he usually then takes the opportunity when he has aught to do for his people against him.","Hence he says, ""The day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come"" (Isa 63:3, 4).","I do not say that this revenge of Christ is, as ofttimes is a man's, of spite, prejudice, or other irregular lettings out of passions; but it ariseth from righteousness and truth; nor can it be but that Jesus must have a desire to take vengeance on his enemy and ours, since holiness is in him, to the utmost bounds of perfection.","And I say again, that in all his pleading as an Advocate, as well as in his offering as a Priest, he has a hot and flaming desire and design to right himself upon his foe and ours; hence he triumphed over him when he died for us upon the cross, and designed the spoiling of his principality, while he poured out his blood for us before God.","We then have this advantage more, in that Christ is our Advocate, our enemy is also his, and the Lord Jesus counts him so (Col 2:14, 15).",Sixth Privilege.,"As thine Advocate, so thy judge holdeth thine accuser for his enemy also; for it is not of love to righteousness and justice that Satan accuseth us to God, but that he may destroy the workmanship of God.",Wherefore he also fighteth against God when he accuseth the children; and this thy Father knows right well.,"He must therefore needs distinguish between the charge and the mind that brings it; especially when what is charged upon us is under the gracious promise of a pardon, as I have showed it is.","Shall not the Judge then hear his Son-for our Advocate is his Son-in the cause of one that he favours, and that he justly can, against an enemy who seeks his dishonour, and the destruction of his eternal dishonour, and the destruction of his eternal designs of grace?","A mention of the judge's son goes far with countrymen; and great striving there is with them who have great enemies and bad causes to get the judge's son to plead, promising themselves that the judge is as like to hear him, and to yield a verdict to his plea, as to any other lawyer.","But what now shall we say concerning our Judge's Son, who takes part, not only with his children, but with him, and with law and justice, in pleading against our accuser?","Yea, what shall we say when both Judge, and Advocate, and law, are all bent to make our persons stand and escape, whatever, and how truly soever, the charge and accusation is by which we are assaulted of the devil.","And yet all this is true; wherefore, here is another privilege of them that have Jesus for their Advocate.",Seventh Privilege.,"Another privilege that they have who have Jesus Christ for their Advocate is, that he is undaunted, and of a good courage, as to the cause that he undertakes; for that is a requisite qualification for a lawyer, to be bold and undaunted in a man's cause.","Such an one is coveted, especially by him that knows he has a brazen-faced antagonist.","Wherefore, he saith that ""he will set his face like a flint,"" when he stands up to plead the cause of his people (Isa 50:5-7).","Lawyers, of all men, need this courage, and to be above others, men of hard foreheads, because of the affronts that sometimes they meet with, be their cause never so good, in the face sometimes, of the chief of a kingdom.","Now Christ is our lawyer, and stands up to plead, not only sometimes, but always, for his people, before the God of gods, and that not in a corner, but while all the host of heaven stands by, both on the right hand and on the left.","Nor is it to be doubted but that our accuser brings many a sore charge against us into the court; but, however, we have an Advocate that is valiant and courageous, one that will not fail nor be discouraged till he has brought judgment unto victory.","Hence John asserts his name, saying, ""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ.""","Men love to understand a man before they commit their cause unto him-to wit, whether he be fitly qualified for their business.","Well, here is an Advocate propounded, an Advocate to plead our cause against our foe.",But what is he?,What is his name?,Is he qualified for my business?,"The answer is, It is Jesus Christ.",How?,"Jesus Christ, what!",That old friend of publicans and sinners?,Jesus Christ!,"He used never to fail, he used to set his face like a flint against Satan when he pleaded the cause of his people.",Is it Jesus Christ?,says the knowing soul; then he shall be mine Advocate.,"For my part, I have often wondered, when I have considered what sad causes Jesus Christ sometimes takes in hand, and for what sad souls he sometimes pleads with God his Father.","He had need of a face as hard as flint, else how could he bear up in that work in which for us sometimes he is employed-a work enough to make angels blush.","Some, indeed, will lightly put off this, and say, ""It is his office""; but, I say, his office, notwithstanding the work in itself is hard, exceeding hard, when he went to die, had he not despised the shame, he had turned his back upon the cross, and left us in our blood.","And now it is his turn to plead, the case would be the same, only he can make argument upon that which to us seems to yield no argument at all, to take courage to plead for a Joshua, for a Joshua clothed, clothed with filthy garments.","He, saith he, that ""shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation: of him shall the Son of man be ashamed,"" &C (Mark 8:38).",Hence it follows that Christ will be ashamed of some; but why not ashamed of others?,"It is not because their cause is good, but because they are kept from denying of him professedly; wherefore, for such he will force himself, and will set his face like a flint, and will, without shame, own, plead, and improve his interest with God for them, even for them whose cause is so horribly bad and gross that themselves do blush while they think thereof.",But what will not love do?,What will not love bear with?,And what will not love suffer?,"Of all the offices of Jesus Christ, I think this trieth him as much as any!","True, his offering himself in sacrifice tried him greatly, but that was but for awhile; his grappling, as a captain, with the curse, death, and hell, tried him much, but that also was but for awhile; but this office of being an Advocate, though it meeteth not with such sudden depths of trouble, yet what is wants in shortness it may meet with in length of time.","I know Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more; yet he has not left off, though in heaven, to do some works of service for his saints on earth; for there he pleads as an Advocate or lawyer for his people (Heb 8:1, 2).","And let it be that he has no cause of shame when he standeth thus up to plead for so vile a wretch as I, who have so vilely sinned, yet I have cause to think that well he may, and to hold my hands before my face for shame, and to be confounded with shame, while he, to fetch me off from condemnation for my transgressions, sets his face like a flint to plead for me with God, and against my accuser.",But thus much for the seventh privilege that they have by Christ who have him for their Advocate.,Eighth Privilege.,"Another privilege that they have who have Jesus Christ to be their Advocate is this, He is always ready, always in court, always with the judge, then and there to oppose, if our accuser comes, and to plead against him what is pleadable for his children.","And this the text implies where it saith, ""We have an Advocate with the Father,"" always with the Father.","Some lawyers, though they are otherwise able and shrewd, yet not being always in court and ready, do suffer their poor clients to be baffled and nonsuited23 by their adversary; yea, it so comes to pass because of this neglect, that a judgment is got out against them for whom they have undertaken to plead, to their great perplexity and damage: but no such opportunity can Satan have of our Advocate, for he is with the Father, always with the Father; as to be a Priest, so to be an Advocate-""We have an Advocate with the Father.""","It is said of the priests, they wait at the altar, and that they give attendance there, (I Cor 9:13); also of the magistrate, that as to his office, he should attend ""continually on this very thing"" (Rom 13:6).","And as these, so Christ, as to his office of an Advocate, attends continually upon that office with his Father.","""We have an Advocate with the Father,"" always with the Father.","And truly such an Advocate becomes the children of God, because of the vigilance of their enemy; for it is said of him, that ""he accuseth us day and night,"" so unweariedly doth he both seek and pursue our destruction (Rev 12:10).","But behold how we are provided for him-""We have an Advocate with the Father.""","If he come a-days, our Advocate is with the Father; if he come a-nights, our Advocate is with the Father24 Thus, then, is our Advocate ready to put check to Satan, come he when he will or can, to accuse us to the Father.","Wherefore these two texts are greatly to be minded, one of them, for that it shows us the restlessness of our enemy, the other, for that it shows us the diligence of our Advocate.","That, also, in the Hebrews shows us the carefulness of our Advocate, where it saith, He is gone ""into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us"" (Heb 9:24).","Now, just the time present; NOW, the time always present; NOW, let Satan come when he will!","Nor is it to be omitted that this word that thus specifies the time, the present time, doth also conclude it to be that time in which we are imperfect in grace, in which we have many failings, in which we are tempted and accused of the devil to God; this is the time, and in it, and every whit of it, he now appeareth in the presence of God for us.","Oh, the diligence of our enemy; oh, the diligence of our friend!-the one against us, the other for us, and that continually-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","This, then, that Jesus Christ is always an Advocate with the Father for us, and so continually ready to put a check to every accusation that Satan brings into the presence of God against us, is another of the privileges that they have, who have Jesus Christ for their Advocate.",Ninth Privilege.,"Another privilege that they have who have Jesus Christ to be their Advocate is this, he is such an one that will not, by bribes, by flattery, nor fair pretenses, be turned aside from pursuing of his client's business.","This was the fault of lawyers in old time, that they would wrest judgment for a bribe.","Hence the Holy One complained, that a bribe did use to blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the judgment of the righteous (I Sam 12:3; Amos 5:12; Deut 16:19).","There are three things in judgment that a lawyer must take heed of-one is the nature of the offence, the other is the meaning and intendment of the law-makers, and a third is to plead for them in danger, without respect to affection or reward; and this is the excellency of our Advocate, he will not, cannot be biased to turn aside from doing judgment.","And this the apostle intendeth when he calleth our Advocate ""Jesus Christ the righteous.""","""We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous""; or, as another prophet calls him, to wit, ""The just Lord-one that will not do iniquity""-that is, no unrighteousness in judgment (Zeph 3:5).","He will not be provoked to do it, neither by the continual solicitations of thine enemy; nor by thy continual provocations wherewith, by reason of thy infirm condition, thou dost often tempt him to do it.","And remember that thy Advocate pleads by the new covenant, and thine adversary accuses by the old; and again, remember that the new covenant is better and more richly provided with grounds of pleading for our pardon and salvation, than the old can be with grounds for a charge to be brought in by the devil against us, suppose our sin be never so heinous.","It is a better covenant, established upon better promises.","Now, put these two together-namely, that Jesus Christ is righteous, and will not swerve in judgment; also, that he pleads for us by the new law, with which Satan hath nothing to do, nor, had he, can he by it bring in a plea against us, because that law, in the very body of it, consists in free promises of giving grace unto us, and of an everlasting forgiveness of our sin (Jer 31:31-34; Eze 36:25-30; Heb 8:8-13) O children, your Advocate will stick to the law, to the new law, to the new and everlasting covenant, and will not admit that anything should be pleaded by our foe that is inconsistent with the promise of the gift of grace, and of the remission of all sin.","This, therefore, is another privilege that they are made partakers of who have Jesus Christ to be their Advocate.","He is just, he is righteous, he is ""Jesus Christ the righteous""; he will not be turned aside to judge awry, either of the crime or the law, for favour or affection.",Nor is there any sin but what is pardonable committed by those that have chosen Jesus Christ to be their Advocate.,Tenth Privilege.,"Another privilege that they have who have Jesus Christ to be their Advocate, is this, the Father has made him, even him that is thine Advocate, the umpire and judge in all matters that have, do, or shall fall out betwixt him and us.","Mark this well; for when the judge himself, before whom I am accused, shall make mine Advocate, the judge of the nature of the crime for which I am accused, and of matter of law by which I am accused-to wit, whether it is in force against me to condemnation, or whether by the law of grace I am set free, especially since my Advocate has espoused my cause, promised me deliverance, and pleaded my right to the state of eternal life-must it not go well with me?","Yes, verily.","The judge, then, making thine Advocate the judge, for he ""hath committed all judgment unto the Son,"" hath done it also for thy sake who hast chosen him to be thine Advocate (John 5:22) It was a great thing that happened to Israel when Joseph was become their advocate, and when Pharaoh had made him a judge.","""Thou,"" says he, ""shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled.","See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt-and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt-only in the throne will I be greater than thou"" (Gen 41:40,44).","Joseph in this was a type of Christ, and his government here of the government of Christ for his church.","Kings seldom make a man's judge his advocate; they seldom leave the issue of the whole affair to the arbitration of the poor man's lawyer; but when they do, methinks it should even go to the heart's desire of the client whose the advocate is, especially when, as I said before, the cause of the client is become the concern of the advocate, and that they are both wrapped up in the self-same interest; yea, when the judge himself also is therein concerned; and yet thus it is with that soul who has Jesus Christ for his Advocate.","What sayest thou, poor heart, to this?","The judge-to wit, the God of heaven, has made thy Advocate, arbitrator in thy business; he is to judge; God has referred the matter to him, and he has a concern in thy concern, an interest in thy good speed.","Christian man, dost thou hear?","Thou hast put thy cause into the hand of Jesus Christ, and hast chosen him to be thine Advocate to plead for thee before God and against thy adversary; and God has referred the judgment of that matter to thy Advocate, so that he has power to determine the matter.",I know Satan is not pleased with this.,"He had rather things should have been referred to himself, and then woe had been to the child of God; but, I say, God has referred the business to Jesus Christ, has made him umpire and judge in thine affair.",Art thou also willing that he should decide the matter?,"Canst thou say unto him as David, ""Judge me, O God, and plead my cause"" (Psa 43:1)?","Oh, the care of God towards his people, and the desire of their welfare!","He has provided them an Advocate, and he has referred all causes and things that may by Satan be objected and brought in against us, to the judgment and sentence of Christ our Advocate.","But to come to a conclusion for this; and therefore, Eleventh Privilege.",The advantage that he has that has the Lord Jesus for his Advocate is very great.,"Thy Advocate has the cause, has the law, has the judge, has the purse, and so consequently has all that is requisite for an Advocate to have, since together with these he has heart, he has wisdom, he has courage, and loves to make the best improvement of his advantages for the benefit of his client; and that which adds to all is, he can prove the debt paid, about which Satan makes such ado-a price given for the ransom of my soul and for the pardon of my sins.","Lawyers do use to make a great matter of it, when they can prove, that that very debt is paid for which their client is sued at law.","Now this Christ Jesus himself is witness to; yea, he himself has paid it, and that out of his own purse, for us, with his own hands, before and upon the mercy-seat, according as the law requireth (Lev 16:13-15; Heb 9:11-24).",What then can accrue to our enemy?,or what advantage can he get by his thus vexing and troubling the children of the Most High?,"Certainly nothing, but, as has been said already, to be cast down; for the kingdom of our God, which is a kingdom of grace, and the power of his Christ will prevail.","Samson's power lay in his hair, but Christ's power, his power to deliver us from the accusation and charge of Satan, lieth in the worth of his undertakings.","And hence it is said again, ""And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,"" and he was cast out and down (Rev 12:10-12).","And thus much for the privileges that those are made partakers of, who have Jesus Christ to be their Advocate.",[THE NECESSITY OF HAVING CHRIST FOR OUR ADVOCATE.],"Fifthly, I come now to the fifth thing, which is, to show you what necessity there is that Christ should be our Advocate.","That Christ should be a Priest to offer sacrifice, a King to rule, and a Prophet to teach, all seeing men acknowledge is of necessity; but that he should be an Advocate, a pleader for his people, few see the reason of it.","But he is an Advocate, and as an Advocate has a work and employ distinct from his priestly, kingly, or prophetical offices.","John says, ""He is our Advocate,"" and signifieth also the nature of his work as such, in that very place where he asserteth his office; as also I have showed you in that which goes before.","But having already showed you the nature, I will now show you the necessity of this office.",First.,It is necessary for the more full and ample vindication of the justice of God against all the cavils of the infernal spirits.,Christ died on earth to declare the justice of God to men in his justifying the ungodly.,"God standeth upon the vindication of his justice, as well as upon the act thereof.","Hence the Holy Ghost, by the prophets and apostles, so largely disputeth for the vindication thereof, while it asserteth the reality of the pardon of sin, the justification of the unworthy, and their glorification with God (Rom 3:24; Isa, Jer, Mal; Rom 3, 4, 8; Gal 3,4).","I say, while it disputeth the justness of this high act of God against the cavils of implacable sinners.","Now the prophets and apostles, in those disputes by which they seek to vindicate the justice of God in the salvation of sinners, are not only ministers of God to us, but advocates for him; since, as Elihu has it, they ""speak on God's behalf,"" or, as the margin has it, ""I will show thee that there are yet words for God,"" words to be spoken and pleaded against his enemies for the justification of his actions (Job 36:2).","Now, as it is necessary that there should be advocates for God on earth to plead for his justice and holiness, while he saveth sinners, against the cavils of an ungodly people, so it is necessary that there should be an Advocate also in heaven, that may there vindicate the same justice and holiness of God from all those charges that the fallen angels are apt to charge it with, while it consenteth that we, though ungodly, should be saved.","That the fallen angels are bold enough to charge God to his face with unjustness of language, is evident in the 1st and 2nd of Job; and that they should not be as bold to charge him with unjustness of actions, nothing can be showed to the contrary.","Further, that God seeks to clear himself of this unjust charge of Satan is as manifest; for all the troubles of his servant Job were chiefly for that purpose.","And why he should have one also in heaven to plead for the justness of his doing in the forgiveness and salvation of sinners appears also as necessary, even because there is one, even an Advocate with the Father, or on the Father's side, seeking to vindicate his justice, while he pleadeth with him for us, against the devil and his objections.",God is wonderfully pleased with his design in saving of sinners; it pleases him at the heart.,"And since he also is infinitely just, there is need that an Advocate should be appointed to show how, in a way of justice as well as mercy, a sinner may be saved.","The good angels did not at first see so far into the mysteries of the gospel of the grace of God, but that they needed further light therein for the vindication of their Lord as servants.","Wherefore they yet did pry and look narrowly into it further, and also bowed their heads and hearts to learn yet more, by the church, of ""the manifold wisdom of God"" (I Peter 1:12; Eph 3:9,10).","And if the standing angels were not yet, to the utmost, perfect in the knowledge of this mystery, and yet surely they must know more thereof than those that fell could do, no wonder if those devils, whose enmity could not but animate their ignorance, made, and do make, their cavils against justice, insinuating that it is not impartial and exact, because it, as it is just, justifieth the ungodly.","That Satan will quarrel with God I have showed you, and that he will also dispute against his works with the holy angels, is more than intimated by the apostle Jude, verse 9, and why not quarrel with, and accuse the justice of God as unrighteous, for consenting to the salvation of sinners, since his best qualifications are most profound and prodigious attempts to dethrone the Lord God of his power and glory.","Nay, all this is evident, since ""we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","And again, I say, it is evident that one part of his work as an Advocate, is to vindicate the justice of God while he pleadeth for our salvation, because he pleadeth a propitiation; for a propitiation respects God as well as us; the appeasing his wrath, and the reconciling of his justice to us, as well as the redeeming us from death and hell; yea, it therefore doth the one, because it doth the other.","Now, if Christ, as an Advocate, pleadeth a propitiation with God, for whose conviction doth he plead it?","Not for God's; for he has ordained it, allows it, and gloriously acquiesces therein, because he knows the whole virtue thereof.","It is therefore for the conviction of the fallen angels, and for the confounding of all those cavils that can be invented and objected against our salvation by those most subtle and envious ones.","But, Second.","There is matter of law to be objected, and that both against God and us; at least, there seems to be so, because of the sanction that God has put upon the law, and also because we have sinned against it.","God has said, ""In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die""; and, ""the soul that sinneth, it shall die.""","God also standeth still upon the vindication of his justice, he also saveth sinners.","Now, in comes our accuser, and chargeth us of sin, of being guilty of sin, because we have transgressed the law.","God also will not be put out of his way, or steps of grace, to save us; also he will say, he is just and righteous still.","Ay, but these are but say-so's.",How shall this be proved?,"Why, now, here is room for an advocate that can plead to matter of law, that can preserve the sanction of the law in the salvation of the sinner-""He will magnify the law, and make it honourable"" (Isa 42:21).","The margin saith, ""and make him honourable25""--that is, he shall save the sinner, and preserve the holiness of the law, and the honour of his God.",But who is this that can do this?,"""It is the servant of God,"" saith the prophet, (Isa 42:1, 13), ""the Lord, a man of war.""",But how can this be done by him?,"The answer is, It shall be done, ""for God is well pleased for his righteousness' sake""; for it is by that he magnifies the law, and makes his Father honourable-that is, he, as a public person, comes into the world under the law, fulfills it, and having so done, he gives that righteousness away, for he, as to his own person, never had need thereof; I say, he gives that righteousness to those that have need, to those that have none of their own, that righteousness might be imputed to them.","This righteousness, then, he presenteth to God for us, and God, for this righteousness' sake, is well pleased that we should be saved, and for it can save us, and secure his honour, and preserve the law in its sanction.","And this Christ pleadeth against Satan as an Advocate with the Father for us; by which he vindicates his Father's justice, holdeth the child of God, notwithstanding his sins, in a state of justification, and utterly overthroweth and confoundeth the devil.","For Christ, in pleading thus, appeals to the law itself, if he has not done it justice, saying, ""Most mighty law, what command of thine have I not fulfilled?",What demand of thine have I not fully answered?,"Where is that jot or tittle of the law that is able to object against my doings for want of satisfaction?""","Here the law is mute; it speaketh not one word by way of the least complaint, but rather testifies of this righteousness that it is good and holy, (Rom 3:22, 23; 5:15-19).","Now, then, since Christ did this as a public person, it follows that others must be justified thereby; for that was the end and reason of Christ's taking on him to do the righteousness of the law.","Nor can the law object against the equity of this dispensation of heaven; for why might not that God, who gave the law his being and his sanction, dispose as he pleases of the righteousness which it commendeth?","Besides, if men be made righteous, they are so; and if by a righteousness which the law commendeth, how can fault be found with them by the law?","Nay, it is ""witnessed by the law and the prophets,"" who consent that it should be unto all, and upon all them that believe, for their justification (Rom 3:20,21).","And that the mighty God suffereth the prince of the devils to do with the law what he can, against this most wholesome and godly doctrine; it is to show the truth, goodness, and permanency thereof; for this is as who should say, Devil, do thy worst!","When the law is in the hand of an easy pleader, though the cause that he pleadeth be good, a crafty opposer may overthrow the right; but here is the salvation of the children in debate, whether it can stand with law and justice; the opposer of this is the devil, his argument against it is the law; he that defends the doctrine is Christ the Advocate, who, in his plea, must justify the justice of God, defend the holiness of the law, and save the sinner from all the arguments, pleas, stops and demurs that Satan is able to put in against it.","And this he must do fairly, righteously, simply, pleading the voice of the self-same law for the justification of what he standeth for, which Satan pleads against it; for though it is by the new law that our salvation comes, yet by the old law is the new law approved of and the way of salvation thereby by it consented to.","This shows, therefore, that Christ is not ashamed to own the way of our justification and salvation, no, not before men and devils.","It shows also that he is resolved to dispute and plead for the same, though the devil himself shall oppose it.","And since our adversary pretends a plea in law against it, it is meet that there should be an open hearing before the Judge of all about it; but, forasmuch as we neither can nor dare appear to plead for ourselves, our good God has thought fit we should do it by an advocate: ""We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","This, therefore, is the second thing that shows the need that we have of an Advocate-to wit, our adversary pretends that he has a plea in law against us, and that by law we should be otherwise disposed of than to be made possessors of the heavenly kingdom.","But, Third.","There are many things relating to the promise, to our life, and to the threatenings, that minister matter of question and doubt, and give the advantage of objections unto him that so eagerly desireth to be putting in cavils against our salvation, all which it hath pleased God to repel by Jesus Christ our Advocate.",1.,"There are many things relating to the promises, as to the largeness and straitness of words, as to the freeness and conditionality of them, which we are not able so well to understand; and, therefore, when Satan dealeth with us about them, we quickly fall to the ground before him; we often conclude that the words of the promise are too narrow and strait to comprehend us; we also think, verily, that the conditions of some promises do utterly shut us out from hope of justification and life; but our Advocate, who is for us with the Father, he is better acquainted with, and learned in, this law than to be baffled out with a bold word or two, or with a subtle piece of hellish sophistication (Isa 50:4).","He knows the true purport, intent, meaning, and sense of every promise, and piece of promise that is in the whole Bible, and can tell how to plead it for advantage against our accuser, and doth so.","And I gather it not only from his contest with Satan for Joshua, (Zech 3), and from his conflict with him in the wilderness, (Matt 4), and in heaven, (Rev 14), but also from the practice of Satan's emissaries here; for what his angels do, that doth he.","Now there is here nothing more apparent than that the instruments of Satan do plead against the church, from the pretended intricacy, ambiguity, and difficulty of the promise; whence I gather, so doth Satan before the tribunal of God; but there we have one to match him; ""we have an Advocate with the Father,"" that knows law and judgment better than Satan, and statute and commandment better than all his angels; and by the verdict of our Advocate, all the words, and limits, and extensions of words, with all conditions of the promises, are expounded and applied!","And hence it is that it sometimes so falleth out that the very promise we have thought could not reach us, to comfort us by any means, has at another time swallowed us up with joy unspeakable.","Christ, the true Prophet, has the right understanding of the Word as an Advocate, has pleaded it before God against Satan, and having overcome him at the common law, he hath sent to let us know it by his good Spirit, to our comfort, and the confusion of our enemy.","Again, 2.","There are many things relating to our lives that minister to our accuser occasions of many objections against our salvation; for, besides our daily infirmities, there are in our lives gross sins, many horrible backslidings; also we ofttimes suck and drink in many abominable errors and deceitful opinions, of all which Satan accuseth us before the judgment-seat of God, and pleadeth hard that we may be damned for ever for them.","Besides, some of these things are done after light received, against present convictions and dissuasions to the contrary, against solemn engagements to amendment, when the bonds of love were upon us (Jer 2:20).","These are crying sins; they have a loud voice in themselves against us, and give to Satan great advantage and boldness to sue for our destruction before the bar of God; nor doth he want skill to aggravate and to comment profoundly upon all occasions and circumstances that did attend us in these our miscarriages-to wit, that we did it without a cause, also, when we had, had we had grace to have used them, many things to have helped us against such sins, and to have kept us clean and upright.","""There is also a sin unto death,"" (I John 5:16), and he can tell how to labour, by argument and sleight of speech, to make our transgressions, not only to border upon, but to appear in the hue, shape, and figure of that, and thereto make his objection against our salvation.","He often argueth thus with us, and fasteneth the weight of his reasons upon our consciences, to the almost utter destruction of us, and the bringing of us down to the gates of despair and utter destruction; the same sins, with their aggravating circumstances, as I said, he pleadeth against us at the bar of God.","But there he meeteth with Jesus Christ, our Lord and Advocate, who entereth his plea against him, unravels all his reasons and arguments against us, and shows the guile and falsehood of them.","He also pleadeth as to the nature of sin, as also to all those high aggravations, and proveth that neither the sin in itself, nor yet as joined with all its advantageous circumstances, can be the sin unto death, (Col 2:19), because we hold the head, and have not ""made shipwreck of faith,"" (I Tim 1:19), but still, as David and Solomon, we confess, and are sorry for our sins.","Thus, though we seem, through our falls, to come short of the promise, with Peter, (Heb 4:1-3), and leave our transgressions as stumbling blocks to the world, with Solomon, and minister occasion of a question of our salvation among the godly, yet our Advocate fetches us off before God, and we shall be found safe and in heaven at last, by them in the next world, who were afraid they had lost us in this.","But all these points must be managed by Christ for us, against Satan, as a lawyer, an advocate, who to that end now appears in the presence of God for us, and wisely handleth the very crisis of the word, and of the failings of his people, together with all those nice and critical juggles by which our adversary laboureth to bring us down, to the confusion of his face.",3.,"There are also the threatenings that are annexed to the gospel, and they fall now under our consideration.","They are of two sorts-such as respect those who altogether neglect and reject the gospel, or those that profess it, yet fall in or from the profession thereof.","The first sort of threatening cannot be pleaded against the professors of the gospel as against those that never professed it; wherefore he betaketh himself to manage those threatenings against us that belong to those that have professed, and that have fallen from it (Psa 109:1-6).","Joshua fell in it (Zech 3:1, 2).","Judas fell from it, and the accuser stands at the right hand of them before the judgment of God, to resist them, by pleading the threatenings against them-to wit, that God's soul should have no pleasure in them.","""If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.""","Here is a plea for Satan, both against the one and the other; they are both apostatized, both drawn back, and he is subtle enough to manage it.","Ay, but Satan, here is also matter sufficient for a plea for our Advocate against thee, forasmuch as the next words distinguish betwixt drawing back, and drawing back ""unto perdition""; every one that draws back, doth not draw back unto perdition (Heb 10:38, 39).","Some of them draw back from, and some in the profession of, the gospel.","Judas drew back from, and Peter in the profession of his faith; wherefore Judas perishes, but Peter turns again, because Judas drew back unto perdition, but Peter yet believed to the saving of the soul.26 Nor doth Jesus Christ, when he sees it is to no boot, at any time step in to endeavour to save the soul.","Wherefore, as for Judas, for his backsliding from the faith, Christ turns him up to Satan, and leaveth him in his hand, saying, ""When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin"" (Psa 109:7) But he will not serve Peter so-""The Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged"" (Psa 37:33).","He will pray for him before, and plead for him after, he hath been in the temptation, and so secure him, by virtue of his advocation, from the sting and lash of the threatening that is made against final apostasy.","But, Fourth.","The necessity of the Advocate's office in Jesus Christ appears plainly in this-to plead about the judgments, distresses, afflictions, and troubles that we meet withal in this life for our sins.","For though, by virtue of this office, Christ fully takes us off from the condemnation that the unbelievers go down to for their sins, yet he doth not thereby exempt us from temporal punishments, for we see and feel that they daily overtake us; but for the proportioning of the punishment, or affliction for transgression, seeing that comes under the sentence of the law, it is fit that we should have an Advocate that understands both law and judgment, to plead for equal distribution of chastisement, according, I say, to the law of grace; and this the Lord Jesus doth.","Suppose a man for transgression be indicted at the assizes; his adversary is full of malice, and would have him punished sorely beyond what by the law is provided for such offence; and he pleads that the judge will so afflict and punish as he in his malicious mind desireth.","But the man has an advocate there, and he enters his plea against the cruelty of his client's accuser, saying, My lord, it cannot be as our enemy would have it; the punishment for these transgressions is prescribed by that law that we here ground our plea upon; nor may it be declined to satisfy his envy; we stand here upon matters of law, and appeal to the law.",And this is the work of our Advocate in heaven.,"Punishments for the sin of the children come not headlong, not without measure, as our accuser would have them, nor yet as they fall upon those who have none to plead their cause.27 Hath he smote the children according to the stroke wherewith he hath smitten others?","No; ""in measure when it shooteth forth,"" or seeks to exceed due bounds, ""thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind"" (Isa 27:8).","""Thou wilt debate with it,"" inquiring and reasoning by the law, whether the shootings forth of the affliction (now going out for the offence committed) be not too strong, too heavy, too hot, and of too long a time admitted to distress and break the spirit of this Christian; and if it be, he applies himself to the rule to measure it by, he fetches forth his plumb line, and sets it in the midst of his people, (Amos 7:8; Isa 28:17), and lays righteousness to that, and will not suffer it to go further; but according to the quality of the transgression, and according to the terms, bounds, limits, and measures which the law of grace admits, so shall the punishment be.","Satan often saith of us when we have sinned, as Abishai said of Shimei after he had cursed David, Shall not this man die for this?",(II Sam 19:21).,"But Jesus, our Advocate, answers as David, What have I to do with thee, O Satan?","Thou this day art an enemy to me; thou seekest for a punishment for the transgressions of my people above what is allotted to them by the law of grace, under which they are, and beyond what their relation that they stand in to my Father and myself will admit.","Wherefore, as Advocate, he pleadeth against Satan when he brings in against us a charge for sins committed, for the regulating of punishments, both as to the nature, degree, and continuation of punishment; and this is the reason why, when we are judged, we are not condemned, but chastened, ""that we should not be condemned with the world"" (I Cor 11:32).","Hence king David says, the Lord hath not given him over to the will of his enemy (Psa 27:12).","And again, ""The Lord hath chastened me sore; but he hath not given me over unto death"" (Psa 118:18).","Satan's plea was, that the Lord would give David over to his will, and to the tyranny of death.","No, says our Advocate, that must not be; to do so would be an affront to the covenant under which grace has put them; that would be to deal with them by a covenant of works, under which they are not.",There is a rod for children; and stripes for those of them that transgress.,"This rod is in the hand of a Father, and must be used according to the law of that relation, not for the destruction, but correction of the children; not to satisfy the rage of Satan, but to vindicate the holiness of my Father; not to drive them further from, but to bring them nearer to their God.","But, Fifth.","The necessity of the advocateship of Jesus Christ is also manifest in this, for that there is need of one to plead the efficacy of old titles to our eternal inheritance, when our interest thereunto seems questionable by reason of new transgressions.","That God's people may, by their new and repeated sins, as to reason at least, endanger their interest in the eternal inheritance, is manifest by such groanings of theirs as these-""Why dost thou cast me off?""",(Psa 43:2).,"""Cast me not away from thy presence"" (Psa 51:11).","And, ""O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever?""",(Psa 74:1).,"Yet I find in the book of Leviticus, that though any of the children of Israel should have sold, mortgaged, or made away with their inheritance, they did not thereby utterly make void their title to an interest therein, but it should again return to them, and they again enjoy the possession of it, in the year of jubilee.","In the year of jubilee, saith God, you shall return every man to his possession; ""the land shall not be sold for ever,"" nor be quite cut off, ""for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.","And in all the land of your possession, ye shall grant a redemption for the land"" (Lev 25:23,24).","The man in Israel that, by waxing poor, did sell his land in Canaan, was surely a type of the Christian who, by sin and decays in grace, has forfeited his place and inheritance in heaven; but as the ceremonial law provided that the poor man in Canaan should not, by his poverty, lose his portion in Canaan for ever, but that it should return to him in the year of jubilee; so the law of grace has provided that the children shall not, for their sin, lose their inheritance in heaven for ever, but that it shall return to them in the world to come (I Cor 11:32)28 All therefore that happeneth in this case is, they may live without the comfort of it here, as he that had sold his house in Canaan might live without the enjoyment of it till the jubilee.","They may also seem to come short of it when they die, as he in Canaan did that deceased before the year of jubilee; but as certainly as he that died in Canaan before the jubilee did yet receive again his inheritance by the hand of his relative survivor when the jubilee came, so certainly shall he that dieth, and that seemeth in his dying to come short of the celestial inheritance now, be yet admitted, at his rising again, to the repossession of his old inheritance at the day of judgment.","But now here is room for a caviler to object, and to plead against the children, saying, They have forfeited their part of paradise by their sin; what right, then, shall they have to the kingdom of heaven?","Now let the Lord stand up to plead, for he is Advocate for the children; yea, let them plead the sufficiency of their first title to the kingdom, and that it is not their doings can sell the land for ever.","The reason why the children of Israel could not sell the land for ever was, because the Lord, their head, reserved to himself a right therein-""The land shall not be sold for ever, for the land is mine.""","Suppose two or three children have a lawful title to such an estate, but they are all profuse and prodigal, and there is a brother also that has by law a chief right to the same estate: this brother may hinder the estate from being sold for ever, because it is his inheritance, and he may, when the limited time that his brethren had sold their share therein is out, if he will, restore it to them again.","And in the meantime, if any that are unjust should go about utterly and for ever to deprive his brethren, he may stand up and plead for them; that in law the land cannot be sold for ever, for that it is his as well as theirs, he being resolved not to part with his right.",O my brethren!,"Christ will not part with his right of the inheritance unto which you are also born; your profuseness and prodigality shall not make him let go his hold that he hath for you of heaven; nor can you, according to law, sell the land for ever, since it is his, and he hath the principal and chief title thereto.","This also gives him ground to stand up to plead for you against all those that would hold the kingdom from you for ever; for let Satan say what he can against you, yet Christ can say, ""The land is mine,"" and consequently that his brethren could not sell it.","Yes, says Satan, if the inheritance be divided.","O but, says Christ, the land is undivided; no man has his part set out and turned over to himself; besides, my brethren yet are under age, and I am made their guardian; they have not power to sell the land for ever; the land is mine; also my Father has made me feoffee in trust for my brethren, that they may have what is allotted them when they are all come to a perfect man, ""unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ"" (Eph 4:13).","And not before, and I will reserve it for them till then; and thus to do is the will of my Father, the law of the Judge, and also my unchangeable resolution.",And what can Satan say against this plea?,Can he prove that Christ has no interest in the saints' inheritance?,"Can he prove that we are at age, or that our several parts of the heavenly house are already delivered into our own power?","And if he goes about to do this, is not the law of the land against him?","Doth it not say that our Advocate is ""Lord of all,"" (Acts 10:36), that the kingdom is Christ's, that it is laid up in heaven for us, (Eph 5:5, Col 1:5); yea, that the ""inheritance which is incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, is reserved in heaven for us, who are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation"" (I Peter 1:4, 5).","Thus therefore is our heavenly inheritance made good by our Advocate against the thwartings and branglings29 of the devil; nor can our new sins make it invalid, but it abideth safe to us at last, notwithstanding our weaknesses; though, if we sin, we may have but little comfort of it, or but little of its present profits, while we live in this present world.","A spendthrift, though he loses not his title, may yet lose the present benefit, but the principal will come again at last; for ""we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""",Sixth.,"The necessity of the advocateship of Jesus Christ for us further appears in this-to wit, for that our evidences, which declare that we have a right to the eternal inheritance, are often out of our own hand, yea, and also sometimes kept long from us, the which we come not at the sight or comfort of again but by our Advocate, especially when our evidences are taken from us, because of a present forfeiture of this inheritance to God by this or that most foul offence.","Evidences, when they are thus taken away, as in David's case they were, (Psa 51:12), why then they are in our God's hand, laid up, I say, from the sight of them to whom they belong, till they even forget the contents thereof (II Peter 1:5-9).30 Now when writings and evidences are out of the hand of the owners, and laid up in the court, where in justice they ought to be kept, they are not ordinarily got thence again but by the help of a lawyer-an Advocate.",Thus it is with the children of God.,"We do often forfeit our interest in eternal life, but the mercy is, the forfeit falls into the hand of God, not of the law nor of Satan, wherefore he taketh away also our evidences, if not all, yet some of them, as he saith-""I have taken away my peace from this people, even loving-kindness and mercies"" (Jer 16:5).","This he took from David, and he entreats for the restoration of it, saying, ""Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit"" (I Chron 17:13; Psa 51:12).","And, ""Lord, turn us again, cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved"" (Psa 80:3, 7, 19.)","Satan now also hath an opportunity to plead against us, and to help forward the affliction, as his servants did of old, when God was but a little angry (Zech 1:15); but Jesus Christ our Advocate is ready to appear against him, and to send us from heaven our old evidences again, or to signify to us that they are yet good and authentic, and cannot be gainsaid.","""Gabriel,"" saith he, ""make this man to understand the vision"" (Dan 8:16).","And again, saith he to another, ""Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls"" (Zech 2:4).","Jerusalem had been in captivity, had lost many evidences of God's favour and love by reason of her sin, and her enemy stepped in to augment her sin and sorrow; but there was a man [the angel of the Lord] ""among the myrtle trees"" that were in the bottom that did prevail with God to say, I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; and then commands it to be proclaimed that his ""cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad"" (Zech 1:11-17).","Thus, by virtue of our Advocate, we are either made to receive our old evidences for heaven again, or else are made to understand that they yet are good, and stand valid in the court of heaven; nor can they be made ineffectual, but shall abide the test at last, because our Advocate is also concerned in the inheritance of the saints in light.","Christians know what it is to lose their evidences for heaven, and to receive them again, or to hear that they hold their title by them; but perhaps they know not how they come at this privilege; therefore the apostle tells them ""they have an Advocate""; and that by him, as Advocate, they enjoy all these advantages is manifest, because his Advocate's office is appointed for our help when we sin-that is, commit sins that are great and heinous-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate.","""31 By him the justice of God is vindicated, the law answered, the threatenings taken off, the measure of affliction that for sin we undergo determined, our titles to eternal life preserved, and our comfort of them restored, notwithstanding the wit, and rage, and envy of hell.","So, then, Christ gave himself for us as a priest, died for us as a sacrifice, but pleadeth justice and righteousness in a way of justice and righteousness; for such is his sacrifice, for our salvation from the death that is due to our foul or high transgressions-as an Advocate.","Thus have I given you thus far, an account of the nature, end, and necessity of the Advocateship of Jesus Christ, and should now come to the use and application, only I must first remove an objection or two.",[OBJECTIONS REMOVED.],"SIXTHLY, [I now come to answer some objections.]",First Objection.,But what need all these offices of Jesus Christ?,"or, what need you trouble us with these nice distinctions?","It is enough for us to believe in Christ in the general, without considering him under this and that office.",Answer.,"The wisdom of God is not to be charged with needless doing when it giveth to Jesus Christ such variety of offices, and calleth him to so many sundry employments for us; they are all thought necessary by heaven, and therefore should not be counted superfluous by earth.","And to put a question upon thy objection-What is a sacrifice without a priest, and what is a priest without a sacrifice?",And the same I say of his Advocate's office-What is an advocate without the exercise of his office?,"And what need of an Advocate's office to be exercised, if Christ, as sacrifice and Priest, was thought sufficient by God?",Each of these offices is sufficient for the perfecting the work for which it is designed; but they are not all designed for the self-same particular thing.,Christ as sacrifice offereth not himself; it is Christ as Priest does that.,Christ as Priest dieth not for our sins; it is Christ as sacrifice does so.,"Again, Christ as a sacrifice and a Priest limits himself to those two employs, but as an Advocate he launches out into a third.","And since these are not confounded in heaven, nor by the Scriptures, they should not be confounded in our apprehension, nor accounted useless.","It is not, therefore, enough for us that we exercise our thoughts upon Christ in an indistinct and general way, but we must learn to know him in all his offices, and to know the nature of his offices also; our condition requires this, it requireth it, I say, as we are guilty of sin, as we have to do with God, and with our enemy the devil.","As we are guilty of sin, so we need a sacrifice; and as we are also sinners, we need one perfect to present our sacrifice to God for us.",We have need also of him as priest to present our persons and services to God.,"And since God is just, and upon the judgment-seat, and since also we are subject to sin grievously, and again, since we have an accuser who will by law plead at this bar of God our sins against us, to the end we might be condemned, we have need of, and also ""have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""",Alas!,"How many of God's precious people, for want of a distinct knowledge of Christ in all his offices, are at this day sadly baffled with the sophistications of the devil?","To instance no more than this one thing-when they have committed some heinous sin after light received, how are they, I say, tossed and tumbled and distressed with many perplexities!","They cannot come to any anchor in this their troubled sea; they go from promise to promise, from providence to providence, from this to that office of Jesus Christ, but forget that he is, or else understand not what it is for this Lord Jesus to be an Advocate for them.","Hence they so oft sink under the fears that their sin is unpardonable, and that therefore their condition is desperate; whereas, if they could but consider that Christ is their Advocate, and that he is therefore made an Advocate to save them from those high transgressions that are committed by them, and that he waits upon this office continually before the judgment-seat of God, they would conceive relief, and be made to hold up their head, and would more strongly twist themselves from under that guilt and burden, those ropes and cords wherewith by their folly they have so strongly bound themselves, than commonly they have done, or do.",Second Objection.,"But notwithstanding what you have said, this sin is a deadly stick in my way; it will not out of my mind, my cause being bad, but Christ will desert me.",Answer.,"It is true, sin is, and will be, a deadly stick and stop to faith, attempt to exercise it on Christ as considered under which of his offices or relations you will; and, above all, the sin of unbelief is ""the sin that doth so,"" or most ""easily beset us"" (Heb 12:1, 2).","And no marvel; for it never acteth alone, but is backed, not only with guilt and ignorance, but also with carnal sense and reason.","He that is ignorant of this knows but little of himself, or what believing is.","He that undertakes to believe sets upon the hardest task that ever was proposed to man; not because the things imposed upon us are unreasonable or unaccountable, but because the heart of man, the more true anything is, the more it sticks and stumbles thereat; and, says Christ, ""Because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not"" (John 8:45).","Hence believing is called labouring, (Heb 4:11); and it is the sorest labour, at times that any man can take in hand, because assaulted with the greatest oppositions; but believe thou must, be the labour never so hard, and that not only in Christ in a general way, but in him as to his several offices, and to this of his being an Advocate in particular, else some sins and some temptations will not, in their guilt or vexatious trouble, easily depart from thy conscience; no, not by promise, nor by thy attempts to apply the same by faith.","And this the text insinuateth by its setting forth of Christ as Advocate, as the only or best and most speedy way of relief to the soul in certain cases.","There is, then, an order that thou must observe in exercising of thy soul in a way of believing.",1.,"Thou must believe unto justification in general; and for this thou must direct thy soul to the Lord Christ as he is a sacrifice for sin; and as a Priest offering that sacrifice, so as a sacrifice thou shalt see him appeasing Divine displeasure for thy sin, and as a Priest spreading the skirt of his garment over thee, for the covering of thy nakedness; thus being clothed, thou shalt not be found naked.",2.,"This, when thou hast done as well as thou canst, thou must, in the next place, keep thine eye upon the Lord Christ as improving, as Priest in heaven, the sacrifice which he offered on earth for the continuing thee in a state of justification in thy lifetime, notwithstanding those common infirmities that attend thee, and to which thou art incident in all thy holy services or best performances (Rom 5:10; Exo 28:31-38).","For therefore is he a Priest in heaven, and by his sacrifices interceding for thee.",3.,"But if thy foot slippeth, if it slippeth greatly, then know thou it will not be long before a bill be in heaven preferred against thee by the accuser of the brethren; wherefore then thou must have recourse to Christ as Advocate, to plead before God thy judge against the devil thine adversary for thee.",4.,"And as to the badness of thy cause, let nothing move thee, save to humility and self-abasement, for Christ is glorified by being concerned for thee; yea, the angels will shout aloud to see him bring thee off.","For what greater glory can we conceive Christ to obtain ad Advocate, than to bring off his people when they have sinned, notwithstanding Satan so charging of them for it as he doth?","He gloried when he was going to the cross to die; he went up with a shout and the sound of a trumpet, to make intercession for us; and shall we think that by his being an Advocate he receives no additional glory?","It is glory to him, doubtless, to bear the title of an Advocate, and much more to plead and prosper for us against our adversary, as he doth.",5.,"And, I say again, for thee to think that Christ will reject thee for that thy cause is bad, is a kind of thinking blasphemy against this his office and his Word; for what doth such a man but side with Satan, while Christ is pleading against him?","I say, it is as the devil would have it, for it puts strength into his plea against us, by increasing our sin and wickedness.","But shall Christ take our cause in hand, and shall we doubt of good success?","This is to count Satan stronger than Christ; and that he can longer abide to oppose, than Christ can to plead for us.","Wherefore, away with, it, not only as to the notion, but also as to the heart and root thereof.",Oh!,When shall Jesus Christ our Lord be honoured by us as he ought?,"This dastardly heart of ours, when shall it be more subdued and trodden under foot of faith?","When shall Christ ride Lord, and King, and Advocate, upon the faith of his people, as he should?","He is exalted before God, before angels, and above all the power of the enemy; there is nothing comes behind but the faith of his people.",Third Objection.,"But since you follow the metaphor so close, I will suppose, if an advocate be entertained, some recompense must be given him.",His fee-who shall pay him his fee?,I have nothing.,"Could I do anything to make this advocate part of amends, I could think I might have benefit from him; but I have nothing.",What say you to this?32 Answer.,Similitudes must not be strained too far; but yet I have an answer for this objection.,"There is, in some cases, law for them that have no money; ay, law and lawyers too; and this is called a suing in forma pauperis;33 and such lawyers are appointed by authority for that purpose.","Indeed, I know not that it is thus in every nation, but it is sometimes so with us in England; and this is the way altogether in the kingdom of heaven before the bar of God.","All is done there for us in forma pauperis, on free cost; for our Advocate or lawyer is thereto designed and appointed of his Father.","Hence Christ is said to plead the cause, not of the rich and wealthy, but of the poor and needy; not of those that have many friends, but of the fatherless and widow; not of them that are fat and strong, but of those under sore afflictions (Prov 22:22, 23; 23:10, 11; 31:9).","""He shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul,"" or, as it is in the margin, ""from the judges of his soul"" (Psa 109:31).","This, then, is the manner of Jesus Christ with men; he doth freely what he doth, not for price nor reward.","""I have raised him up,"" says God, ""and I will direct all his ways; he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for a price nor reward"" (Isa 45:13).","[This scripture speaks of Cyrus, a type of Christ.]","This, I say, is the manner of Jesus Christ with men; he pleads, he sues in forma pauperis, gratis, and of mere compassion; and hence it is that you have his clients give him thanks; for that is all the poor can give.","""I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.","For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul"" (Psa 109:30,31).","They know but little that talk of giving to Christ, except they mean they would give him blessing and praise.","He bids us come freely, take freely, and tells us that he will give and do freely (Rev 22:17; 21:6).","Let him have that which is his own-to wit, thyself; for thou art the price of his blood.","David speaks very strangely of giving to God for mercy bestowed on him; I call it strangely, because indeed it is so to reason.","""What,"" says he, ""shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?","I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord"" for more (Psa 116:12, 13).","God has no need of thy gift, nor Christ of thy bribe, to plead thy cause; take thankfully what is offered, and call for more; that is the best giving to God.","God is rich enough; talk not then of giving, but of receiving, for thou art poor.","Be not too high, nor think thyself too good to live by the alms of heaven; and since the Lord Jesus is willing to serve thee freely, and to maintain thy right to heaven against thy foe, to the saving of thy soul, without price or reward, ""let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called,"" as is the rest of ""the body, and be ye thankful"" (Col 3:15).","This, then, is the privilege of a Christian-""We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous""; one that pleadeth the cause of his people against those that rise up against them, of his love, pity, and mere good-will.","Lord, open the eyes of dark readers, of disconsolate saints, that they may see who is for them, and on what terms!",Fourth Objection.,"But if Christ doth once begin to plead for me, and shall become mine Advocate, he will always be troubled with me, unless I should, of myself, forsake him; for I am ever in broils and suits of law, action after action is laid upon me, and I am sometimes ten times in a day summoned to answer my doings before God.",Answer.,Christ is not an Advocate to plead a cause or two; nor to deliver the godly from an accusation or two.,"""He delivereth Israel out of all his troubles"" (Psa 25:22; II Sam 22:28); and chooses to be an Advocate for such; therefore, the godly of old did use to make, from the greatness of their troubles, and the abundance of their troublers, an argument to the Lord Christ to send and lend them help-""Have mercy upon me,"" saith David; ""consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me"" (Psa 9:13).","And again, ""Many are they that rise up against me; many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God"" (Psa 3:1,2).","Yea the troubles of this man were so many and great, that his enemies began to triumph over him, saying, ""There is no help for him in God.""","But could he not deliver him, or did the Lord forsake him?","No, no; ""Thou hast smitten,"" saith he, ""all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.""","And as he delivereth them from their troublers, so also he pleadeth all their causes; ""O Lord,"" saith the church, ""thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life"" (Lam 3:58).","Mark, troubled Christian, thou sayest thou hast been arrested ofttimes in a day, and as often summoned to appear at God's bar, there to answer to what shall be laid to thy charge.","And here, for thy encouragement, thou readest that the church hath an Advocate that pleadeth the causes of her soul; that is, all her causes, to deliver her.","He knows that, so long as we are in this world, we are subject to temptation and weakness, and through them made guilty of many bad things; wherefore, he hath prepared himself to our service, and to abide with the Father, an Advocate for us.","As Solomon saith of a man of great wrath, so it may be said of a man of great weakness, and the best of saints are such-he must be delivered again and again, (Prov 19:19); yea, ""many a time,"" saith David, ""did he deliver them,"" (Psa 106:43); to wit, more than once or twice; and he will do so for thee, if thou entertain him to be thine Advocate.","Thou talkest of leaving him, but then whither wilt thou go?","All else are vain things, things that cannot profit; and he will not forsake his people, (I Sam 12:20-23), ""though their land be filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel"" (Jer 51:5).","I know the modest saint is apt to be abashed to think what a troublesome one he is, and what a make-work he has been in God's house all his days; and let him be filled with holy blushing; but let him not forsake his Advocate.",[THE USE AND APPLICATION.],"SEVENTHLY, Having thus spoken to these objections, let us now come to make some use of the whole.","And, Use First.","I would exhort the children to consider the dignity that God hath put upon Jesus Christ their Saviour; for by how much God hath called his Son to offices and places of trust, by so much he hath heaped dignities upon him.","It is said of Mordecai, that he was next to the king Ahasuerus.",And what then?,"Why, then the greatness of Mordecai, and his high advance, must be written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia, to the end his fame might not be buried nor forgotten, but remembered and talked of in generations to come (Esth 10).","Why, my brethren, God exalted Jesus of Nazareth, hath made him the only great one, having given him a name above every name-a name, did I say?-a name and glory beyond all names, and above all names, as doth witness both his being set above all, and the many offices which he executeth for God on behalf of his people.","It is counted no little addition to honour when men are not only made near to the king, but also entrusted with most, if not almost with all the most weighty affairs of the kingdom.","Why, this is the dignity of Christ; he is, it is true, the natural Son of God, and so high, and one that abounds with honour.","But this is not all; God has conferred upon him, as man, all the most mighty honours of heaven; he hath made him Lord Mediator betwixt him and the world.",This in general.,"And particularly, he hath called him to be his High Priest for ever, and hath sworn he shall not be changed for another (Heb 7:21-24).","He hath accepted of his offering once for ever, counting that there is wholly enough in what he did once ""to perfect for ever them that are sanctified""; to wit, set apart to glory (Heb 10:11-14).","He is Captain-general of all the forces that God hath in heaven and earth, the King and Commander of his people (ch.","9:25, 28).","He is Lord of all, and made ""head over all things to the church,"" and is our Advocate with the Father (Eph 1:22).","O, the exaltation of Jesus Christ!","Let Christians, therefore, in the first place, consider this.","Nor can it be but profitable to them, if withal they consider that all this trust and honour is put and conferred upon him in relation to the advantage and advancement of Christians.","If Christians do but consider the nearness that is betwixt Christ and them, and, withal, consider how he is exalted, it must needs be matter of comfort to them.",He is my flesh and my bone that is exalted; he is my friend and brother that is thus set up and preferred.,"It was something to the Jews when Mordecai was exalted to honour; they had, thereby, ground to rejoice and be glad, for that one of themselves was made lord-chief by the king, and the great governor of the land, for the good of his kindred.","True, when a man thinks of Christ as severed from him, he sees but little to his comfort in Christ's exaltation; but when he looks upon Christ, and can say, My Saviour, my Priest, or the chief Bishop of my soul, then he will see much in his being thus promoted to honour.","Consider, then, of the glories to which God has exalted our Saviour, in that he hath made him so high.","It is comely, also, when thou speakest of him, that thou name his name with some additional title, thereby to call thy mind to the remembrance, and so to the greater reverence of the person of thy Jesus; as, our Lord Jesus, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, ""the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus"" (II Peter 2:20; Heb 3:1, &c).","Men write themselves by their titles; as, John, earl of such a place, Anthony, earl of such a place, Thomas, lord, &c. It is common, also, to call men in great places by their titles rather than by their names; yea, it also pleaseth such great ones well; as, My lord high chancellor of England, My lord privy seal, My lord high admiral, &c. And thus should Christians make mention of Jesus Christ our Lord, adding to his name some of his titles of honour; especially since all places of trust and titles of honour conferred on him are of special favour to us.","I did use to be much taken with one sect of Christians; for that it was usually their way, when they made mention of the name of Jesus, to call him ""The blessed King of Glory.""","Christians should do thus; it would do them good; for why doth the Holy Ghost, think you, give him all these titles but that we should call him by them, and so make mention of him one to another; for the very calling of him by this or that title, or name, belonging to this or that office of his, giveth us occasion, not only to think of him as exercising that office, but to inquire, by the Word, by meditation, and one of another, what there is in that office and what, by his exercising of that, the Lord Jesus profiteth his church.","How will men stand for that honour that, by superiors, is given to them, expecting and using all things; to wit, actions and carriages, so as that thereby their grandeur may be maintained; and saith Christ, ""Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am"" (John 13:13).","Christ Jesus our Lord would have us exercise ourselves in the knowledge of his glorious offices and relative titles, because of the advantage that we get by the knowledge of them, and the reverence of, and love to, him that they beget in our hearts.","""That disciple,"" saith the text, ""whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord.","Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him (for he was naked), and did cast himself into the sea.","And the other disciples came in a little ship"": to wit, to shore, to wait upon their Lord (John 21).","The very naming of him under the title of Lord, bowed their hearts forthwith to come with joint readiness to wait upon him.","Let this also teach us to distinguish Christ's offices and titles, not to confound them, for he exerciseth those offices, and beareth those titles, for great reason, and to our commodity.","Every circumstance relating both to Christ's humiliation and exaltation ought to be duly weighed by us, because of that mystery of God, and of man's redemption that is wrapped therein; for as there was not a pin, nor a loop, nor a tack in the tabernacle but had in it use of instruction to the children of Israel, so there is not any part, whether more near or more remote to Christ's suffering and exaltation, but is, could we get into it, full of spiritual advantage to us.","To instance the water that came out of Christ's side, a thing little taken notice of either by preachers or hearers, and yet John makes it one of the witnesses of the truth of our redemption, and a confirmation of the certainty of that record that God, to the world, hath given of the sufficiency that is in his Son to save (John 19:34; I John 3:5-9; 5:5-9; I John 4:9-12).","When I have considered that the very timing of Scripture expressions, and the season of administering ordinances, have been argumentative to the promoting of the faith and way of justification by Christ, it has made think that both myself and most of the people of God look over the Scriptures too slightly, and take too little notice of that or of those many honours that God, for our good, has conferred upon Christ.","Shall he be called a King, a Priest, a Prophet, a Sacrifice, an Altar, a Captain, a Head, a Husband, a Father, a Fountain, a Door, a Rock, a Lion, a Saviour, &c., and shall we not consider these things?","And shall God to all these add, moreover, that he is an Advocate, and shall we take no notice thereof, or jumble things so together, that we lose some of his titles and offices; or so be concerned with one as not to think we have need of the benefit of the rest?","Let us be ashamed thus to do or think, and let us give to him that is thus exalted the glory due unto his name.",Use Second.,"As we should consider the titles and offices of Christ in general, so we should consider this of his being an Advocate in particular; for this is one of the reasons which induced the apostle to present him here under that very notion to us-namely, that we should have faith about it, and consider of it to our comfort-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","""An advocate""-an advocate, as I said, is one that hath power to plead for another in this, or that, or any court of judicature.","Be much therefore in the meditation of Christ, as executing of this his office for thee, for many advantages will come to thee thereby.","As, 1.","This will give thee to see that thou art not forsaken when thou hast sinned; and this has not in it a little relief only, but yieldeth consolation in time of need.","There is nothing that we are more prone unto than to think we are forsaken when we have sinned, when for this very thing-to wit, to keep us from thinking so, is the Lord Jesus become our Advocate-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate.""","Christian, thou that hast sinned, and that with the guilt of thy sin art driven to the brink of hell, I bring thee news from God-thou shalt not die, but live, for thou hast ""an Advocate with the Father.""","Let this therefore be considered by thee, because it yieldeth this fruit.",2.,"The study of this truth will give thee ground to take courage to contend with the devil concerning the largeness of grace by faith, since thy Advocate is contending for thee against him at the bar of God.","It is a great encouragement for a man to hold up his head in the country, when he knows he has a special friend at court.","Why, our Advocate is a friend at court, a friend there ready to give the onset to Satan, come he when he will.","""We have an Advocate with the Father""; an Advocate, or one to plead against Satan for us.",3.,"This consideration will yield relief, when, by Satan's abuse of some other of the offices of Christ, thy faith is discouraged and made afraid.","Christ as a prophet pronounces many a dreadful sentence against sin; and Christ as a king is of power to execute them; and Satan as an enemy has subtlety enough to abuse both these, to the almost utter overthrow of the faith of the children of God.",But what will he do with him as he is an Advocate?,Will he urge that he will plead against us?,He cannot; he has no such office.,"""Will he plead against me with his great power?","No, but he would put strength into me""(Job 23:6).","Wherefore Satan doth all he may to keep thee ignorant of this office; for he knows that as Advocate, when he is so apprehended, the saints are greatly relieved by him, even by a believing thought of that office.",4.,"This consideration, or the consideration of Christ as exercising of this office, will help thee to put by that visor wherewith Christ by Satan is misrepresented to thee, to the weakening and affrighting of thee.","There is nothing more common among saints than thus to be wronged by Satan; for as he will labour to fetch fire out of the offices of Christ to burn us, so to present him to us with so dreadful and so ireful a countenance, that a man in temptation, and under guilt, shall hardly be able to lift up his face to God.","But now, to think really that he is my Advocate, this heals all!","Put a visor upon the face of a father, and it may perhaps for a while fright the child; but let the father speak, let him speak in his own fatherly dialect to the child, and the visor is gone, if not from the father's face, yet from the child's mind; yea, the child, notwithstanding that visor, will adventure to creep into its father's bosom.","Why, thus it is with the saints when Satan deludes and abuses them by disfiguring the countenance of Christ to their view.","Let them but hear their Lord speak in his own natural dialect (and then he doth so indeed when we hear him speak as an Advocate), and their minds are calmed, their thoughts settled, their guilt made to vanish, and their faith to revive.","Indeed, the advocateship of Jesus Christ is not much mentioned in the Word, and because it is no oftener made mention of, therefore perhaps it is that some Christians do so lightly pass it over; when, on the contrary, the rarity of the thing should make it the more admirable; and perhaps it is therefore so little made mention of in the Bible, because it should not by the common sort be abused, but is as it were privately dropped in a corner, to be found by them that are for finding relief for their soul by a diligent search of the Scriptures; for Christ in this office of advocateship is only designed for the child of God, the world hath nothing therewith to do.34 Methinks that which alone is proper to saints, and that which by God is peculiarly designed for them, they should be mightily taken withal; the peculiar treasure of kings, the peculiar privilege of saints, oh, this should be affecting to us!-why, Christ, as an Advocate, is such.","""Remember me, O Lord,"" said the Psalmist, ""with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; that I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance"" (Psa 106:4, 5).","The Psalmist, you see here, is crying out for a share in, and the knowledge of, the peculiar treasure of saints; and this of Christ as Advocate is such; wherefore study it, and prize it so much the more, this Advocate is ours.",(1.),Study it with reference to its peculiarity.,"It is for the children, and nobody else; for the children, little and great.",This is children's bread; this is a mess for Benjamin; this is to be eaten in the holy place.,"Children use to make much of that which, by way of specialty, is by their relations bestowed on them-""And Naboth said to Ahab, The Lord forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee"" (I Kings 21:3).","No, truly will I not.",Why so?,"Because it was my father's gift, not in common to all, but to me in special.",(2.),"Study this office in the nature of it; for therein lies the excellency of anything, even in the nature of it.","Wrong thoughts of this or that abuses it, and takes its natural glory from it.","Take heed, therefore, of misapprehending, while thou art seeking to apprehend Christ as thy Advocate.","Men judge of Christ's offices while they are at too great a distance from them; but ""let them come near,"" says God, ""then let them speak,"" (Isa 41:1); or as Elihu said to his friends, when he had seen them judge amiss, ""Let us choose to us judgment, let us know among ourselves what is good"" (Job 34:4).","So say I; study to know, rightly to know, the Advocate-office of Jesus Christ.","It is one of the easiest things in the world to miss of the nature, while we speak of the name and offices of Jesus Christ; wherefore look to it, that thou study the nature of the office of his advocateship, of his advocateship for, for so you ought to consider it.","There is an Advocate for, not against, the children of God-""Jesus Christ the righteous.""",(3.),Study this office with reference to its efficacy and prevalency.,"Job says, ""After my words, they spake not again"" (Job 29:22).","And when Christ stands up to plead, all must keep silence before him.","True, Satan had the first word, but Christ the last, in the business of Joshua, and such a last as brought the poor man off well, though ""clothed with filthy garments"" (Zech 3).","Satan must be speechless after a plea of our Advocate, how rampant soever he is afore; or as Elihu has it, ""They were amazed; they answered no more; they left off speaking.""","Shall he that speaks in righteousness give place, and he who has nothing but envy and deceit be admitted to stand his ground?","Behold, the angels cover their faces when they speak of his glory, how then shall not Satan bend before him?","In the days of his humiliation, he made him cringe and creep, how much more, then, now he is exalted to glory, to glory to be an Advocate, an Advocate for his people!","""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""",(4.),"Study the faithfulness of Christ in his execution of this office, for he will not fail nor forsake them that have entertained him for their Advocate: ""He will thoroughly plead their cause"" (Jer 50:34).","Faithful and true, is one of his titles; and you shall be faithfully served by him; you may boldly commit your cause unto him, nor shall the badness of it make him fail, or discourage him in his work; for it is not the badness of a cause that can hinder him from prevailing, because he hath wherewith to answer for all thy sins, and a new law to plead by, through which he will make thee a conqueror.","He is also for sticking to a man to the end, if he once engages for him (John 13:1, 2).","He will threaten and love, he will chastise and love, he will kill and love, and thou shalt find it so.","And he will make this appear at the last; and Satan knows it is so now, for he finds the power of his repulses while he pleadeth for him at the bar against him.",And all this is in very faithfulness.,(5.),Study also the need that thou hast of a share in the execution of the advocateship of Jesus Christ.,"Christians find that they have need of washing in the blood of Christ, and that they have need of being clothed with the righteousness of Christ; they also find that they have need that Christ should make intercession for them, and that by him, of necessity, they must approach God, and present their prayers and services to him; but they do not so well see that they need that Christ should also be their Advocate.",And the reason thereof is this: they forget that their adversary makes it his business to accuse them before the throne of God; they consider not the long scrolls and many crimes wherewith he chargeth them in the presence of the angels of God.,"I say, this is the cause that the advocateship of Christ is so little considered in the churches; yea, many that have been relieved by that office of his, have not understood what he has thereby done for them.","But perhaps this is to be kept from many till they come to behold his face, and till all things shall be revealed, that Christ might have glory given him in the next world for doing of that for them which they so little thought of in this.","But do not thou be content with this ignorance, because the knowledge of his advocating it for thee will yield thee present relief.","Study, therefore, thine own weakness, the holiness of the judge, the badness of thy cause, the subtlety, malice, and rage, of thine enemy; and be assured that whenever thou sinnest, by and by thou art for it accused before God at his judgment seat.","These things will, as it were, by way of necessity, instill into thy heart the need that thou hast of an advocate, and will make thee look as to the blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ to justify thee, so to Christ as an Advocate to plead thy cause, as did holy Job in his distresses (Job 16:21).",Use Third.,"Is Christ Jesus not only a priest of, and a King over, but an Advocate for his people?","Let this make us stand and wonder, and be amazed at his humiliation and condescension.","We read of his humiliation on earth when he put himself into our flesh, took upon him our sins, and made them as his own unto condemnation and death.","And to be an advocate is an office reproachful to the malicious, if any man be such an one, for those that are base and unworthy.","Yea, and the higher and more honourable the person is that pleads for such, the more he humbles himself.","The word doth often in effect account him now in heaven as a servant for us, and acts of service are acts of condescension; and I am sure some acts of service have more of that in them than some; and I think when all things are considered, that Christ neither doth nor can do anything for us there, of a more condescending nature, than to become our Advocate.","True, he glories in it; but that doth not show that the work is excellent in itself.","It is also one of his titles of honour; but that is to show how highly God esteems of, and dignifies all his acts; and though this shall tend at last to the greatening of his honour and glory in his kingdom, yet the work itself is amazingly mean.",I speak after the manner of men.,It is accounted so in this world.,"How ignoble and unrespectful doth a man make himself, especially to his enemy, when he undertakes to plead a bad cause, if it happeneth to be the cause of the base and unworthy!","And I am sure we are, every one, so in ourselves, for whom he is become an Advocate with the Father.","True, we are made worthy in him, but that is no thanks to us; as to ourselves and our cause, both are bad enough.","And let us now leave off disputing, and stand amazed at his condescension; ""Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven"" (Psa 113:6).","And men of old did use to wonder to think that God should so much stoop, as to open his eyes to look upon man, or once so much as to mind him (Job 7:17; 14:1-3; Psa 8:4; 144:3, 4).","And if these be acts that speak a condescension, what will you count of Christ's standing up as an Advocate to plead the cause of his people?",Must not that be much more so accounted?,"O, the condescension of Christ in heaven!","While cavillers quarrel at such kind of language, let the saints stay themselves and wonder at it, and be so much the more affected with his grace.","The persons are base, the crimes are base, with which the persons are charged; wherefore one would think that has but the reason to think, that it is a great condescension of Christ, now in heaven, to take upon him to be an Advocate for such a people, especially if you consider the openness of this work of Christ; for this thing is not done in a corner.",This is done in open court.,1.,"With a holy and just God; for he is the judge of all, and his eyes are purer than to behold iniquity; yea, his very essence and presence is a consuming fire; yet, before and with this God, and that for such a people, Jesus Christ, the King, will be an Advocate.","For one mean man to be an Advocate for the base, with one that is not considerable, is not so much; but for Christ to be an Advocate for the base, and for the base, too, under the basest consideration, this is to be wondered at.","When Bathsheba, the queen became an advocate for Adonijah unto king Solomon, you see how he flounced at her, for that his cause was bad.","""And why,"" saith he, ""dost thou ask Abishag for Adonijah?","Ask for him the kingdom also"" (I Kings 2:16-23).","I told you before, that to be an advocate did run one upon hazards of reproach; and it may easily be thought that the queen did blush, when, from the king, her son, she received such a repulse; nor do we hear any more of her being an advocate; I believe she had enough of this.",But oh!,"This Christ of God, who himself is greater that Solomon, he is become an Advocate, ""an Advocate with the Father,"" who is the eternally just, and holy, and righteous God; and that for a people, with respect to him, far worse than could be Adonijah in the eyes of his brother Solomon.","Majesty and justice are dreadful in themselves, and much more so when approached by any, especially when the cause, as to matter of fact, is bad, that the man is guilty of who is concerned in the advocateship of his friend; and yet Jesus Christ is still an Advocate for us, ""an Advocate with the Father.""",2.,"Consider, also, before whom Jesus Christ doth plead as an Advocate, and that is before, or in the presence and observation of, all the heavenly host; for whilst Christ pleadeth with God for his people, all the host of heaven stand by on the right hand and on the left (Matt 10:32).","And though as yet there may seem to be but little in this consideration, yet Christ would have us know, and account it an infinite kindness of his to us that he will confess, and not be ashamed of us before the angels of his Father (Mark 8:38).","Angels are holy and glorious creatures, and, in some respect, may have a greater knowledge of the nature and baseness of sin than we while here are capable of; and so may be made to stand and wonder while the Advocate pleads with God for a people, from head to foot, clothed therewith.","But Christ will not be ashamed to stand up for us before them, though they know how bad we are, and what vile things we have done.","Let this, therefore, make us wonder.",3.,"Add to these, how unconcerned ofttimes those are with themselves, and their own desolate condition, for whom Christ, as an Advocate, laboureth in heaven with God.",Alas!,"The soul is as far off of knowing what the devil is doing against it at God's bar as David was when Saul was threatening to have his blood, while he was hid in the field (I Sam 20:26-34).","But, O true Jonathan!",How didst thou plead for David!,"Only here thou hadst the advantage of our Advocate, thou hadst a good cause to plead;

nor is our present senselessness and unconcernedness about his pleading but an aggravation to our sin.,"Perhaps David was praying while Jonathan was playing the advocate for him before the king his father; but perhaps the saint is sleeping, yea, sinning more, whilst Christ is pleading for him in heaven.",Oh!,"This should greatly affect us; this should make us wonder; this should be so considered by us, as to heighten our souls to admiration of the grace and kindness of Christ.",4.,"Join to these the greatness and gravity, the highness and glorious majesty of the Man that is become our Advocate.","Says the text, it is Jesus Christ-""We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ.""","Now, that he should become an Advocate, that he should embrace such an employ as this of his advocateship, let this be a wonderment, and so be accounted.",But let us come to the fourth use.,Use Fourth.,Is it so?,Is Jesus Christ the Saviour also become our Advocate?,"Then let us labour to make that improvement of this doctrine as tendeth to strengthen our graces, and us, in the management of them.","Indeed, this should be the use that we should make of all the offices of Christ;

stir up thyself, and be not faint; Christ is the Advocate of his people, and pleadeth the cause of the poor and needy.","And as for sin, which is one great stumble to thy actings, O my faith, Christ has not only died for that as a sacrifice, nor only carried his sacrifice unto the Father, in the holiest of all, but is there to manage that offering as an Advocate, pleading the efficacy and worth thereof before God, against the devil, for us.","Thus, I say, we should strengthen our faith; for faith has to do not only with the Word, but also with the offices of Christ.","Besides, considering how many the assaults are that are made upon our faith, we find all little enough to support it against all the wiles of the devil.","Christians too little concern themselves, as I have said, with the offices of Jesus Christ; and therefore their knowledge of him is so little, and their faith in him so weak.","We are bid to have our conversation in heaven, and then a man so hath, when he is there, in his spirit, by faith, observing how the Lord Jesus doth exercise his offices there for him.","Let us often, by faith, go to the bar of God, there to hear our Advocate plead our cause; we should often have our faith to God's judgment-seat, because we are concerned there; there we are accused of the devil, there we have our crimes laid open, and there we have our Advocate to plead; and this is suggested in the text, for it saith, ""We have an Advocate with the Father""; therefore, thither our faith should go for help and relief in the day of our straits.","I say, we should have our faith to God's judgment-seat, and show it there, by the glass of our text,35 what Satan is doing against, and the Lord Jesus for, our souls.","We should also show it how the Lord Jesus carries away every cause from the devil, and from before the judgment-seat, to the comfort of the children, the joy of angels, and the shame of the enemy.","This would strengthen and support our faith indeed, and would make us more able than, for the most part, we are to apply the grace of God to ourselves, and hereafter to give more strong repulses to Satan.","It is easy with a man, when he knows that his advocate has overthrown his enemy at the King's Bench bar or Court of Common Pleas, less to fear him the next time he sees him, and more boldly to answer him when he reneweth his threats on him.","Let faith, then, be strengthened, from its being exercised about the advocateship of Jesus Christ.",2.,"As we should make use of Christ's advocateship for the strengthening of our faith, so we should also make use thereof to the encouraging us to prayer.","As our faith is, so is our prayer; to wit, cold, weak, and doubtful, if our faith be so.","When faith cannot apprehend that we have access to the Father by Christ, or that we have an Advocate, when charged before God for our sins by the devil, then we flag and faint in our prayer; but when we begin to take courage to believe-and then we do so when most clearly we apprehend Christ-then we get up in prayer.","And according as a man apprehends Christ in his undertakings and offices, so he will wrestle with and supplicate God.","As, suppose a man believes that Christ died for his sins; why, then, he will plead that in prayer with God.","Suppose, also, that a man understands that Christ rose again for his justification; why, then, he will also plead that in prayer; but if he knows no more, no further will he go.","But when he shall know that there is also for him an Advocate with the Father, and that that Advocate is Jesus Christ; and when the glory of this office of Christ shall shine in the face of this man's soul; oh, then, he takes courage to pray with that courage he had not before; yea, then is his faith so supported and made strong, that his prayer is more fervent, and importuning abundance.","So that, I say, the knowledge of the advocateship of Christ is very useful to strengthen our graces; and, as of graces in general, so of faith and prayer in particular.","Wherefore, our wisdom is, so to improve this doctrine that prayer may be strengthened thereby.",3.,"As we should make use of this doctrine to strengthen faith and prayer, so we should make use of it to keep us humble; for the more offices Christ executeth for us with the Father, the greater sign that we are bad; and the more we see our badness, the more humble should we be.","Christ gave for us the price of blood; but that is not all; Christ as a Captain has conquered death and the grave for us, but that is not all: Christ as a Priest intercedes for us in heaven; but that is not all.","Sin is still in us, and with us, and mixes itself with whatever we do, whether what we do be religious or civil; for not only our prayers and our sermons, our hearings and preaching, and so; but our houses, our shops, our trades, and our beds, are all polluted with sin.","Nor doth the devil, our night and day adversary, forbear to tell our bad deeds to our Father, urging that we might for ever be disinherited for this.","But what should we now do, if we had not an Advocate; yea, if we had not one who would plead in forma pauperis; yea, if we had not one that could prevail, and that would faithfully execute that office for us?","Why, we must die.","But since we are rescued by him, let us, as to ourselves, lay our hand upon our mouth, and be silent, and say, ""Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory.""","And, I say again, since the Lord Jesus is fain to run through so many offices for us before he can bring us to glory, oh!","how low, how little, how vile and base in our own eyes should we be.","It is a shame for a Christian to think highly of himself, since Christ is fain to do so much for him, and he again not at all able to make him amends; but some, whose riches consist in nothing but scabs and lice, will yet have lofty looks.","But are not they much to blame who sit lifting up of lofty eyes in the house, and yet know not how to turn their hand to do anything so, but that another, their betters, must come and mend their work?","I say, is it not more meet that those that are such, should look and speak, and act as such that declare their sense of their unhandiness, and their shame, and the like, for their unprofitableness?","Yea, is it not meet that to every one they should confess what sorry ones they are?","I am sure it should be thus with Christians, and God is angry when it is otherwise.",Nor doth it become these helpless ones to lift up themselves on high.,Let Christ's advocateship therefore teach us to be humble.,4.,"As we should improve this doctrine to strengthen faith, to encourage prayer, and keep us humble, so we should make use of it to encourage perseverance-that is, to hold on, to hold out to the end; for, for all those causes the apostle setteth Christ before us as an Advocate.","There is nothing more discourages the truly godly than the sense of their own infirmities, as has been hinted all along; consequently, nothing can more encourage them to go on than to think that Christ is an Advocate for them.","The services, also, that Christ has for us to do in this world are full of difficulty, and so apt to discourage: but when a Christian shall come to understand that-if we do what we can-it is not a failing either in matter or manner that shall render it wholly unserviceable, or give the devil that advantage as to plead thereby to prevail for our condemnation and rejection; but that Christ, by being our Advocate, saves us from falling short, as also from the rage of hell.","This will encourage us to hold on, though we do but hobble in all our goings, and fumble in all our doings; for we have Christ for an Advocate in case we sin in the management of any duty-""If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","Let us, therefore, go on in all God's ways as well as we can for our hearts; and when our foot slips, let us tell God of it, and his mercy in Christ shall hold us up (Psa 84:9-12).","Darkness, and to be shut up in prison, is also a great discouragement to us; but our Advocate is for giving us light, and for fetching us out of our prison.","True, he that Joseph chose to be his Advocate with Pharaoh remembered not Joseph, but forgat him (Gen 40:14, 23); but he that has Jesus Christ to be his Advocate shall be remembered before God, (Micah 7:8-10).-""He remembered us in our low estate; for his mercy endureth for ever"" (Psa 136:23).","Yea, he will say to the prisoners, Show yourselves; and to them that are in the prison-house, Go forth.",Satan sometimes gets the saints into the prison when he has taken them captive by their lusts (Rom 7:23).,"But they shall not be always there; and this should encourage us to go on in godly ways; for ""we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.""",Objection.,"But I cannot pray, says one, therefore how should I persevere?","When I go to prayer, instead of praying, my mouth is stopped.",What would you have me do?,Answer.,"Well, soul, though Satan may baffle thee, he cannot so serve thine Advocate; if thou must not speak for thyself, Christ thine Advocate can speak for thee.","Lemuel was to open his mouth for the dumb-to wit, for the sons of destruction, and to plead the cause of the poor and needy (Prov 31:8, 9).","If we knew the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, so as the Word reveals it, we would believe, we would hope, and would, notwithstanding all discouragements, wait for the salvation of the Lord.","But there are many things that hinder, wherefore faith, prayer, and perseverance, are made difficult things unto us-""But if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous"": and, God ""shall fight for you, and you shall hold your peace,"" was once a good word to me when I could not pray.",5.,"As we should improve this doctrine for the improvement and encouragement of these graces, so we should improve it to the driving of difficulties down before us, to the getting of ground upon the enemy-""Resist the devil,"" drive him back; this is it for which thy Lord Jesus is an Advocate with God in heaven; and this is it for the sake of which thou art made a believer on earth (I Peter 5:9; Heb 12:4).","Wherefore has God put this sword, WE HAVE AN ADVOCATE, into thy hand, but to fight thy way through the world?","""Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,"" and say, ""I will go in the strength of the Lord God.""","And since I have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, I will not despair, though ""the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about"" (Psa 49:5).",Use Fifth.,"Doth Jesus Christ stand up to plead for us with God, to plead with him for us against the devil?","Let this teach us to stand up to plead for him before men, to plead for him against the enemies of his person and gospel.","This is but reasonable; for if Christ stands up to plead for us, why should not we stand up to plead for him?","He also expects this at our hands, saying, ""Who will rise up for me against the evil doers?","Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?""",(Psa 94:16).,"The apostle did it, and counted himself engaged to do it, where he saith, he preached ""the gospel of God with much contention"" (I Thess 2:2).","Nor is this the duty of apostles or preachers only, but every child of God should ""earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints"" (Jude 3).","And, as I said, there is reason why we should do this; he standeth for us.","And if we, (1.)","Consider the disparity of persons to plead, it will seem far more reasonable.","He stands up to plead with God, we stand up to plead with men.","The dread of God is great, yea, greater than the dread of men.",(2.),If we consider the persons pleaded for.,"He pleads for sinners, for the inconsiderable, vile, and base; we plead for Jesus, for the great, holy, and honourable.",It is an honour for the poor to stand up for the great and mighty; but what honour is it for the great to plead for the base?,"Reason, therefore, requireth that we stand up to plead for him, though there can be but little rendered why he should stand up to plead for us.",(3.),"He standeth up to plead for us in the most holy place, though we are vile; and why should we not stand up for him in this vile world, since he is holy?",(4.),"He pleads for us, though our cause is bad; why should not we plead for him, since his cause is good?",(5.),"He pleads for us, against fallen angels; why should we not plead for him against sinful vanities?",(6.),He pleads for us to save our souls; why should not we plead for him to sanctify his name?,(7.),He pleads for us before the holy angels; why should not we plead for him before princes?,(8.),"He is not ashamed of us, though now in heaven; why should we be ashamed of him before this adulterous and sinful generation?",(9.),He is unwearied in his pleading for us; why should we faint and be dismayed while we plead for him?,"My brethren, is it not reasonable that we should stand up for him in this world?","Yea, is it not reason that in all things we should study his exaltation here, since he in all things contrives our honour and glory in heaven?","A child of God should study in every of his relations to serve the Lord Christ in this world, because Christ, by the execution of every one of his offices, seeks our promotion hereafter.","If these be not sufficient arguments to bow us to yield up our members, ourselves, our whole selves to God, that we may be servants of righteousness unto him; yea, if by these and such like we are not made willing to stand up for him before men, it is a sign that there is but little, if any, of the grace of God in our hearts.","Yea, further, that we should have now at last in reserve Christ as authorized to be our Advocate to plead for us; for this is the last of his offices for us while we are here, and is to be put in practice for us when there are more than ordinary occasions.","This is to help, as we say, at a dead lift, even then when a Christian is taken for a captive, or when he sinks in the mire where is no standing, or when he is clothed with filthy garments, or when the devil doth desperately plead against us our evil deeds, or when by our lives we have made our salvation questionable, and have forfeited our evidences for heaven.",And why then should not we have also in reserve for Christ?,"And when profession and confession will not do, when loss of goods and a prison will not do, when loss of country and of friends will not do, then to bring it in, then to bring it in as the reserve, and as that which will do-to wit, willingly to lay down our lives for his name; and since he doth his part without grudging for us, let us do ours with rejoicing for him (Isa 24:15; John 21:19).",Use Sixth.,"Doth Jesus Christ stand up to plead for us, and that of his mere grace and love?",Then this should teach Christians to be watchful and wary how they sin against God.,"This inference seems to run retrograde; but whoso duly considers it, will find it fairly fetched from the premises.","Christianity teaches ingenuity, 36 and aptness to be sensible of kindnesses, and doth instruct us to a loathness to be overhard upon him from whom we have all at free cost.","""Shall we-sin that grace may abound?",God forbid.,Shall we do evil that good may come?,God forbid.,"Shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace?","God forbid"" (Rom 6:1, 2, 15).",It is the most disingenuous thing in the world not to care how chargeable we are to that friend that bestows all upon us gratis.,"When Mephibosheth had an opportunity to be yet more chargeable to David, he would not, because he had his life and his all from the mere grace of the king (II Sam 19:24-28).","Also David thought it too much for all his household to go to Absalom's feast, because it was made of free cost.","Why, Christ is our Advocate of free cost, we pay him neither fee nor income for what he doth; nor doth he desire aught of us, but to accept of his free doing for us thankfully; wherefore let us put him upon this work as little as may be, and by so doing we shall show ourselves Christians of the right make and stamp.","We count him but a fellow of a very gross spirit that will therefore be lavishing of what is his friend's, because it is prepared of mere kindness for him; Esau himself was loath to do this; and shall Christians be disingenuous?","I dare say, if Christians were sober, watchful, and of a more self-denying temper, they need not put the Lord Jesus to that to which for the want of these things they do so often put him.","I know he is not unwilling to serve us, but I know also that the love of Christ should constrain us to live not to ourselves, but to him that loved us, that died for us, and rose again (II Cor 5:14, 15).","We shall do that which is naught too much, even then when we watch and take care what we can to prevent it.","Our flesh, when we do our utmost diligence to resist, it will defile both us and our best performances.","We need not lay the reins on its neck and say, What care we?","the more sin the more grace, and the more we shall see the kindness of Christ, and what virtue there is in his Advocate's office to save us.","And should there be any such here, I would present them with a scripture or two; the first is this, ""Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise?""",(Deut 32:6).,"And if this gentle check will not do, then read the other, Shall we say, Let us do evil that good may come?",their damnation is just (Rom 3:8).,"Besides, as nothing so swayeth with us as love, so there is nothing so well pleasing to God as it.","Let a man love, though he has opportunity to do nothing, it is accepted of the God of heaven.","But where there is no love, let a man do what he will, it is not at all regarded (I Cor 13:1-3).","Now to be careless and negligent, and that from a supposed understanding of the grace of Christ in the exercise of his advocateship for us in heaven, is as clear sign as can be, that in thy heart there is no love to Christ, and that consequently thou art just a nothing, instead of being a Christian.","Talk, then, what thou wilt, and profess never so largely, Christ is no Advocate of thine, nor shalt thou, thou so continuing, be ever the better for any of those pleas that Christ, at God's bar, puts in against the devil, for his people.","Christians, Christ Jesus is not unwilling to lay out himself for you in heaven, nor to be an Advocate for you in the presence of his Father; but yet he is unwilling that you should render him evil for good; I say, that you should do so by your remissness and carelessness for want of such a thinking of things as may affect your hearts therewith.","It would be more comely in you, would please him better, would agree with your profession, and also better would prove you gracious, to be found in the power and nature of these conclusions.","""How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?""","(Rom 6:2).""","If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God;

for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience"" (Col 3:1-6).","I say, it would be more comely for Christians to say, We will not sin because God will pardon; we will not commit iniquity because Christ will advocate for us.","""I write unto you that ye sin not; though if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father.""","Why, the brute would conclude, I will not do so, because my master will beat me; I will do thus, for then my master will love me.","And Christians should be above [such] men, brutish men.","And for a conclusion as to this, let me present you with three considerations-(1.)","Know that it is the nature of grace to draw holy arguments to move to goodness of life from the love and goodness of God, but not thence to be remiss (II Cor 5:14).",(2.),Know therefore that they have no grace that find not these effects of the discoveries of the love and goodness of God.,(3.),"Know also that among all the swarms of professors that from age to age make mention of the name of Christ, they only must dwell with him in heaven that do part from iniquity, and are zealous of good works (II Tim 2:19).",He gave himself for these (Titus 2:11-14).,Not that they were so antecedent to this gift.,But those that he hath redeemed to himself are thus sanctified by the faith of him (Acts 26:18).,Use Seventh.,Is it so?,Is Jesus Christ an Advocate with the Father for us?,"Then this should encourage strong Christians to tell the weak ones where, when they are in their temptations and fears through sin, they may have one to plead their cause.",Thus the apostle doth by the text; and thus we should do one to another.,"Mark, he telleth the weak of an Advocate: ""My little children, I write unto you that ye sin not; though if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father.""","Christians, when they would comfort their dejected brethren, talk too much at rovers37 or in generals; they should be more at the mark: ""A word spoken in season, how good is it?""","I say, Christians should observe and inquire, that they may observe the cause or ground of their brother's trouble; and having first taken notice of that, in the next place consider under which of the offices of Jesus Christ this sin or trouble has cast this man; and so labour to apply Christ in the word of the gospel to him.","Sometimes we are bid to consider him as an Apostle and High Priest, and sometimes as a forerunner and an Advocate.","And he has, as was said afore, these divers offices, with others, that we by the consideration of him might be relieved under our manifold temptations.","This, as I said, as I perceive John teaches us here, as he doth a little before of his being a sacrifice for us; for he presenteth them that after conversion shall sin with Christ as an Advocate with the Father.","As who should say, My brethren, are you tempted, are you accused, have you sinned, has Satan prevailed against you?","""We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","Thus we should do, and deliver our brother from death.","There is nothing that Satan more desires than to get good men in his sieve to sift them as wheat, that if possible he may leave them nothing but bran; no grace, but the very husk and shell of religion.","And when a Christian comes to know this, should Christ as Advocate be hid, what could bear him up?","But let him now remember and believe that ""we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,"" and he forthwith conceiveth comfort; for an advocate is to plead for me according as has been showed afore, that I may be delivered from the wrath and accusation of my adversary, and still be kept safe under grace.","Further, by telling of my brother that he hath an Advocate, I put things into his mind that he has not known, or do bring them into remembrance which he has forgotten-to wit, that though he hath sinned, he shall be saved in a way of justice; for an advocate is to plead justice and law, and Christ is to plead these for a saint that has sinned; yea, so to plead them that he may be saved.","This being so, he is made to perceive that by law he must have his sins forgiven him; that by justice he must be justified.","For Christ as an Advocate pleadeth for justice, justice to himself; and this saint is of himself-a member of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.","Nor has Satan so good a right to plead justice against us, though we have sinned, that we might be damned, as Christ has to plead it, though we have sinned, that we might be saved; for sin cannot cry so loud to justice as can the blood of Christ; and he pleads his blood as Advocate, by which he has answered the law; wherefore the law having nothing to object, must needs acquit the man for whom the Lord Jesus pleads.","I conclude this with that of the Psalmist, ""Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.",Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.,Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.,"Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good;

surely in vain and to no purpose was Jesus made an Advocate.","But, soul, there is need of all; and therefore be not thou offended that the Lord Jesus is of the Father made so much to his, but rather admire and wonder that the Father and the Son should be so concerned with so sorry a lump of dust and ashes as thou art.","And I say again, be confounded to think that sin should be a thing so horrible, of power to pollute, to captivate, and detain us from God, that without all this ado (I would speak with reverence of God and his wisdom) we cannot be delivered from the everlasting destruction that it hath brought upon the children of men.","But, I say, what is this to them that are not admitted to a privilege in the advocate-office of Christ?","Whether he is an Advocate or no, the case to them is the same.","True, Christ as a Saviour is not divided; he that hath him not in all, shall have him in none at all of his offices in a saving manner.","Therefore, he for whom he is not an Advocate, he is nothing as to eternal life.","Indeed, Christ by some of his offices is concerned for the elect, before by some others of them he is; but such shall have the blessing of them all before they come to glory.","Nor hath man ground to say Christ is here or there mine, before he hath ground to say, he also is mine Advocate; though that office of his, as has been already showed, stands in the last place, and comes in as a reserve.",But can any imagine that Christ will pray for them as Priest for whom he will not plead as Advocate?,or that he will speak for them to God for whom he will not plead against the devil?,"No, no; they are his own, that he loveth to the end, (John 13:1), to the end of their lives, to the end of their sins, to the end of their temptations, to the end of their fears, and of the exercise of the rage and malice of Satan against them.","To the end may also be understood, even until he hath given them the profit and benefit of all his offices in their due exercise and administration.","But, I say, what is all this to them that have him not for their Advocate?","You may remember that I have already told you that there are several who have not the Lord Jesus for their Advocate-to wit, those that are still in their sins, pursuing of their lusts; those that are ashamed of him before men; and those that are never otherwise but lukewarm in their profession.","And let us now, for a conclusion, make further inquiry into this matter.","Is it likely that those should have the Lord Jesus for their Advocate to plead their cause; who despise and reject his person, his Word, and ways?","or those either who are so far off from sense of, and shame for, sin, that it is the only thing they hug and embrace?","True, he pleadeth the cause of his people both with the Father and against the devil, and all the world besides; but open profaneness, shame of good, and without heart or warmth in religion, are no characters of his people.","It is irrational to think that Christ is an Advocate for, or that he pleadeth the cause of such, who, in the self-same hour, and before his enemies, are throwing dirt in his face by their profane mouths and unsanctified lives and conversations.","If he pleads as an Advocate for any, he must plead against Satan for them, and so consequently must have some special bottom to ground his plea upon; I say, a bottom better than that upon which the carnal man stands; which bottom is either some special relation that this man stands in to God, or some special law he hath privilege by, that he may have some ground for an appeal, if need be, to the justice and righteousness of God; but none of these things belong to them that are dead in trespasses and sins; they stand in no special relation to God: they are not privileged by the law of grace.","Objection.-But doth not Christ as Advocate plead for his elect, though not called as yet?","Answer.-He died for all his elect, he prayeth for all his elect as a Priest, but as an Advocate he pleadeth only for the children, the called only.","Satan objecteth not against God's election, for he knows it not; but he objecteth against the called-to wit, whether they be truly godly or no, or whether they ought not to die for their transgressions (Job 1:9, 10; Zech 3).","And for these things he has some colour to frame an accusation against us, and now it is time enough for Christ to stand up to plead.","I say, for these things he has some colour to frame a plea against us; for there is sin and a law of works, and a judge too, that has not respect of persons.","Now to overthrow this plea of Satan, is Jesus Christ our Advocate; yea, to overthrow it by pleading law and justice; and this must be done with respect to the children only-""My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.","And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.""","FOOTNOTES: 1 ""Nulled"";

one who had done so much, that, with the sinner's aid, the work might be completed.","No such were the opinions of John Bunyan; the furnace of sharp conviction had burnt up this proud dross; he believed the testimony of Scripture, that from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet all nature is corrupted; so that out of the unsanctified heart of man proceed evil thoughts, murders, and the sad catalogue of crimes which our Lord enumerates, and which defile our best efforts after purity of heart and life.","No sinner will ever totally rely upon the Saviour until he is sensible of his own perishing state; hanging by the brittle thread of life over the yawning gulf of perdition; sinking in that sin which will swallow him up in those awful torments which await the transgressor; feeling that sin has fitted him as stubble for the fire; then it is that the cry proceeds from his heart, Lord, save, I perish; and then, and not till then, are we made willing to receive 'Christ as a complete Saviour' to the uttermost, not of his ability, but of our necessity.","This was the subject of all Mr. Bunyan's writings, and, doubtless, of all his preaching.","It was to direct sinners to the Lamb of God, who alone can take away sin.","This little treatise was one of those ten 'excellent manuscripts' which, at Bunyan's decease, were found prepared for the press.","It was first published in 1692, by his friends E. Chandler, J. Wilson, and C. Doe.","It is limited to a subject which is too often lost sight of, because it is within the veil--the intercession of Christ as the finishing work of a sinner's salvation.","Many persons limit the 'looking unto Jesus' to beholding him upon the cross, a common popish error; but this is not enough; we must, in our minds, follow him to the unseen world, and thus ascend to a risen Saviour, at the right hand of the Father, making intercession for our daily sins.","And he is our ONLY Intercessor, and it is a rejection of him, for us to seek the aid of another.","Who ever was mad enough to ask Moses to intercede for him, and surely he is as able as Mary or any other saint?","To atone for sin calls for the amazing price of the blood of Christ, who was 'God manifest in the flesh.'",He undertook the work by covenant; and all the 'saved' form part of his mystical body; thus perfectly obeying the law in him.,"He poured out his life to open a fountain for sin and uncleanness; and as they are liable to pollution in their passage through the world, he only is able, and he ever liveth, to make intercession for their transgressions.","Thus he becomes a complete Saviour, and will crown, with an eternal weight of glory, all those that put their trust in him.","Beautiful, and soul-softening, and heart-warming thoughts abound in this little work, which cannot fail to make a lasting impression upon the reader.",Bunyan disclaims 'the beggarly art of complimenting' in things of such solemnity.,"He describes the heart as unweldable, a remarkable expression, drawn from his father's trade of a blacksmith; nothing but grace can so heat it as to enable the hammer of conviction to weld it to Christ; and when thus welded, it becomes one with him.","There is hope for a returning backslider in a complete Saviour; he combines the evidence of two men, the coming and the returning sinner; he has been, like Jonah, in the belly of hell; his sins, like talking devils, have driven him back to the Saviour.","Sin brings its own punishment, from which we escape by keeping in the narrow path.","Good works save us from temporal miseries, which ever follow an indulgence in sin; but if we fall, we have an Advocate and Intercessor to lift us up; still, if thou lovest thy soul, slight not the knowledge of hell, for that, with the law, are the spurs which Christ useth to prick souls forward to himself.","O gather up thy heels and mend thy pace, or those spurs will be in thy sides.","Take heed, O persecutor; like Saul, thou art exceeding mad, and hell is thy bedlam.","Take heed of a false faith; none is true but that which is acquired by a kneeling, searching, seeking for truth as for hid treasure.","Death is God's bailiff, he will seize thee without warning; but with the saints, the grave's mouth is the final parting place between grace and sin.",Forget not that a good improvement will make your little grace to thrive.,"Reader, may Divine grace indelibly fix these wholesome truths upon our minds.",GEORGE OFFOR.,CHRIST A COMPLETE SAVIOUR.,"'WHEREFORE HE IS ABLE ALSO TO SAVE THEM TO THE UTTERMOST THAT COME UNTO GOD BY HIM, SEEING HE EVER LIVETH TO MAKE INTERCESSION FOR THEM.'",--HEBREWS 7:25.,"The apostle, in this chapter, presenteth us with two things; that is, with the greatness of the person and of the priesthood of our Lord Jesus.","First, He presenteth us with the greatness of his person, in that he preferreth him before Abraham, who is the father of us all; yea, in that he preferreth him before Melchisedec, who was above Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises.","Second, As to his priesthood, he showeth the greatness of that, in that he was made a priest, not by the law of a carnal commandment, but by the power of an endless life.","Not without, but with an oath, by him that said, 'The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec'; wherefore, 'this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.'","Now my text is drawn from this conclusion, namely, that Christ abideth a priest continually.","'Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.'","In the words, I take notice of four things: FIRST, Of the intercession of Christ--He maketh intercession.","SECOND, Of the benefit of his intercession--'Wherefore he is able to save to the uttermost,' &c. THIRD, We have also here set before us the persons interested in this intercession of Christ--And they are those 'that come unto God by him.'","FOURTH, We have also here the certainty of their reaping this benefit by him; to wit, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them--'Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.'",1 [I.,OF THE INTERCESSION OF CHRIST.],"FIRST, We will begin with HIS INTERCESSION, and will show you, First, What that is; Second, For what he intercedes; and, Third, What is also to be inferred from Christ's making intercession for us.","First, I begin, then, with the first; that is, to show you what intercession is.",Intercession is prayer; but all prayer is not intercession.,"Intercession, then, is that prayer that is made by a third person about the concerns that are between two.","And it may be made either to set them at further difference, or to make them friends; for intercession may be made against, as well as for, a person or people.",'Wot ye not what the Scripture saith of Elias?,how he maketh intercession to God against Israel.',"(Rom 11:2) But the intercession that we are now to speak of is not an intercession of this kind, not an intercession against, but an intercession for a people.",'He ever liveth to make intercession for them.',"The high priest is ordained for, but not to be against the people.","'Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God,' to make reconciliation for the sins of the people; or 'that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.'","(Heb 5:1) This, then, is intercession; and the intercession of Christ is to be between two, between God and man, for man's good.",And it extendeth itself unto these: 1.,"To pray that the elect may be brought all home to him; that is, to God.",2.,To pray that their sins committed after conversion may be forgiven them.,3.,To pray that their graces which they receive at conversion may be maintained and supplied.,4.,To pray that their persons may be preserved unto his heavenly kingdom.,"Second, This is the intercession of Christ, or that for which he doth make intercession.",1.,"He prays for all the elect, that they may be brought home to God, and so into the unity of the faith, &c. this is clear, for that he saith, 'Neither pray I for these alone'; that is, for those only that are converted; 'but for them also which shall believe on me through their word'; for all them that shall, that are appointed to believe; or, as you have it a little above, 'for them which thou hast given me.'","(John 17:9,20, Isa 53:12) And the reason is, for that he hath paid a ransom for them.","Christ, therefore, when he maketh intercession for the ungodly, and all the unconverted elect are such, doth but petitionarily ask for his own, his purchased ones, those for whom he died before, that they might be saved by his blood.",2.,"When any of them are brought home to God, he yet prays for them; namely, that the sins which through infirmity they, after conversion, may commit, may also be forgiven them.","This is showed us by the intercession of the high priest under the law, that was to bear away the iniquities of the holy things of the children of Israel; yea, and also by his atonement for them that sinned; for that it saith, 'And the priest shall make an atonement for him, for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.'","(Lev 5:10) This also is intimated even where our Lord doth make intercession, saying, 'I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.'","(John 17:15) That Christ prayed that the converted should be kept from all manner of commission of sin, must not be supposed, for that is the way to make his intercession, at least in some things, invalid, and to contradict himself; for, saith he, 'I know that thou hearest me always.'","(John 11:42) But the meaning is, I pray that thou wouldest keep them from soul-damning delusions, such as are unavoidably such; also that thou wouldest keep them from the soul-destroying evil of every sin, of ever temptation.",Now this he doth by his prevailing and by his pardoning grace.,3.,In his intercession he prayeth also that those graces which we receive at conversion may be maintained and supplied.,"This is clear where he saith, 'Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.'","(Luke 22:31,32) Ay, may some say, he is said to pray here for the support and supply of faith, but doth it therefore follow that he prayed for the maintaining and supply of all our graces?","Yes, in that he prayed for the preservation of our faith, he prayed for the preservation of all our graces; for faith is the mother grace, the root grace, the grace that hath all others in the bowels of it, and that from the which all others flow; yea, it is that which gives being to all our other graces, and that by which all the rest do live.","Let, then, faith be preserved, and all graces continue and live--that is, according to the present state, health, and degree of faith.","So, then, Christ prayed for the preservation of every grace when he prayed for the preservation of faith.","That text also is of the same tendency where he saith, 'Keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given men.'","(John 17:11) Keep them in thy fear, in the faith, in the true religion, in the way of life by thy grace, by thy power, by thy wisdom, &c. This must be much of the meaning of this place, and he that excludes this sense will make but poor work of another exposition.",4.,"He also in his intercession prayeth that our persons be preserved, and brought safe unto his heavenly kingdom.","And this he doth, (1.)",By pleading interest in them.,(2.),"By pleading that he had given, by promise, glory to them.",(3.),By pleading his own resolution to have it so.,(4.),By pleading the reason why it must be so.,(1.),"He prays that their persons may come to glory, for that they are his, and that by the best of titles: 'Thine they were, and thou gavest them me.'","(John 17:6) Father, I will have them; Father, I will have them, for they are mine: 'Thine they were, and thou gavest them me.'","What is mine, my wife, or my child, or my jewel, or my joy, sure I may have it with me.","Thus, therefore, he pleads or cries in his intercession, that our persons might be preserved to glory: They are mine, 'and thou gavest them me.",'2 (2.),"He also pleads that he had given--given already, that is, in the promise--glory to them, and therefore they must not go without it.",'And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them.',"(John 17:22) Righteous men, when they give a good thing by promise, they design the performance of that promise; nay, they more than design it, they purpose, they determine it.","As the mad prophet also saith of God, in another case, 'Hath he said, and shall he not do it?","or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?'","(Num 23:19) Hath Christ given us glory, and shall we not have it?","Yea, hath the truth itself bestowed it upon us, and shall those to whom it is given, even given by Scripture of truth, be yet deprived thereof?",(3.),He pleads in his interceding that they might have glory; his own resolution to have it so.,"'Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am.'","(John 17:24) Behold ye here, he is resolved to have it so.",It must be so.,It shall be so.,I will have it so.,"We read of Adonijah, that his father never denied him in anything.","He never said to him, 'Why hast thou done so?'","(1 Kings 1:6) Indeed, he denied him the kingdom; for his brother was heir of that from the Lord.","How much more will our Father let our Lord Jesus have his mind and will in this, since he also is as willing to have it so as is the Son himself.","'Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.'","(Luke 12:32) Resolution will drive things far, especially resolution to do that which none but they that cannot hinder shall oppose.","Why this is the case, the resolution of our Intercessor is, that we be preserved to glory; yea, and this resolution he pleads in his intercession: 'Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am,' &c. (John 17:24) Must it not, therefore, now be so?",(4.),"He also, in the last place, in this his intercession, urges a reason why he will have it so, namely, 'That they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me; for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.'","(verse 24) And this is a reason to the purpose; it is as if he had said, Father, these have continued with me in my temptations; these have seen me under all my disadvantages; these have seen me in my poor, low, contemptible condition; these have seen what scorn, reproach, slanders, and disgrace I have borne for thy sake in the world; and now I will have them also be where they shall see me in my glory.","I have told them that I am thy Son, and they have believed that; I have told them that thou lovest me, and they have believed that; I have also told them that thou wouldest take me again to glory, and they have believed that; but they have not seen my glory, nor can they but be like the Queen of Sheba, they will but believe by the halves unless their own eyes do behold it.","Besides, Father, these are they that love me, and it will be an increase of their joy if they may but see me in glory; it will be as a heaven to their hearts to see their Saviour in glory.","I will, therefore, that those which 'thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory.'","This, therefore, is a reason why Christ Jesus our Lord intercedes to have his people with him in glory.","Third, I come now to the third thing, namely, to show you what is to be inferred from Christ's making intercession for us.",1.,"This is to be inferred from hence, that saints--for I will here say nothing of those of the elect uncalled--do ofttimes give occasion of offence to God, even they that have received grace; for intercession is made to continue one in the favour of another, and to make up those breaches that, at any time, shall happen to be made by one to the alienating of the affections of the other.","And thus he makes reconciliation for iniquity; for reconciliation may be made for iniquity two ways: first, by paying of a price; secondly, by insisting upon the price paid for the offender by way of intercession.","Therefore you read that as the goat was to be killed, so his blood was, by the priest, to be brought within the veil, and, in a way of intercession, to be sprinkled before and upon the mercy-seat: 'Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is, for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat; and he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them, in the midst of their uncleanness.'","(Lev 16:15,16) This was to be done, as you see, that the tabernacle, which was the place of God's presence and graces, might yet remain among the children of Israel, notwithstanding their uncleannesses and transgressions.","This, also, is the effect of Christ's intercession; it is that the signs of God's presence and his grace might remain among his people, notwithstanding they have, by their transgressions, so often provoked God to depart from them.",2.,"By Christ's intercession I gather, that awakened men and women, such as the godly are, dare not, after offence given, come in their own names to make unto God an application for mercy.","God, in himself, is a consuming fire, and sin has made the best of us as stubble is to fire; wherefore, they may not, they cannot, they dare not approach God's presence for help but by and through a mediator and intercessor.","When Israel saw the fire, the blackness and darkness, and heard the thunder, and lightning, and the terrible sound of the trumpet, 'they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.'","(Exo 20:19, Deut 18:16) Guilt, and sense of the disparity that is betwixt God and us, will make us look out for a man that may lay his hand upon us both, and that may set us right in the eyes of our Father again.","This, I say, I infer from the intercession of Christ; for, if there had been a possibility of our ability to have approached God with advantage without, what need had there been of the intercession of Christ?","Absalom durst not approach--no, not the presence of his father--by himself, without a mediator and intercessor; wherefore, he sends to Joab to go to the king and make intercession for him.","(2 Sam 13, 14:32,33) Also, Joab durst not go upon that errand himself, but by the mediation of another.","Sin is a fearful thing, it will quash and quail the courage of a man, and make him afraid to approach the presence of him whom he has offended, though the offended is but a man.","How much more, then, shall it discourage a man, when once loaden with guilt and shame, from attempting to approach the presence of a holy and a sin-avenging God, unless he can come to him through, and in the name of, an intercessor?","But here now is the help and comfort of the people of God--there is to help them under all their infirmities an intercessor prepared, and at work.",'He ever liveth to make intercession.',3.,"I also infer from hence, that should we, out of an ignorant boldness and presumption, attempt, when we have offended, by ourselves to approach the presence of God, God would not accept us.",He told Eliphaz so.,"What Eliphaz thought, or was about to do, I know not; but God said unto him, 'My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.","Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks, and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves [that is, by him] a burnt-offering, and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept; lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.'","See here, an offence is a bar and an obstruction to acceptance with God, but by a mediator, but by an intercessor.","He that comes to God by himself, God will answer him by himself--that is, without an intercessor; and I will tell you, such are not like to get any pleasant or comfortable answer-I will answer him that so cometh according to the multitude of his idols.","'And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.'","(Eze 14:7,8) He that intercedes for another with a holy and just God had need be clean himself, lest he with whom he so busieth himself say to him, First clear thyself, and then come and speak for thy friend.","Wherefore, this is the very description and qualification of this our High Priest and blessed Intercessor, 'For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins,' &c. (Heb 7:26,27) Had we not had such an Intercessor, we had been but in a very poor case; but we have one that becomes us; one that fits us to the purpose; one against whom our God hath nothing, can object nothing; one in whose mouth no guile could be found.3 4.","Since Christ is an Intercessor, I infer that he has wherewithal in readiness to answer to any demands that may be propounded by him that hath been by us offended, in order to a renewing of peace and letting out of that grace to us that we have sinned away, and yet have need of.","Ofttimes the offended saith to the intercessor, Well, thou comest to me about this man; what interest he has in thee is one thing, what offence he has committed against me is another.",I speak now after the manner of men.,"Now, what can an intercessor do, if he is not able to answer this question?","But now, if he be able to answer this question--that is, according to law and justice, no question but he may prevail with the offended, for him for whom he makes intercession.","Why, this is our case; to be sure, thus far it is, we have offended a just and a holy God, and Jesus Christ is become Intercessor.","He also knows full well, that for our parts, if it would save us from hell, we cannot produce towards a peace with God so much as poor two farthings; that is, not anything that can by law and justice be esteemed worth a halfpenny; yet he makes intercession.","It follows, therefore, that he has wherewith of his own, if that question afore is propounded, to answer to every reasonable demand.","Hence, it is said, that he has gifts as well as sacrifice for sin.",'Every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.',"(Heb 8:3) And, observe it, the apostle speaks here of Christ as in heaven, there ministering in the second part of his office; 'For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest.'","(verse 4) These gifts, therefore, and this sacrifice, he now offereth in heaven by way of intercession, urging and pleading as an Intercessor, the valuableness of his gifts for the pacifying of that wrath that our Father hath conceived against us for the disobediences that we are guilty of.",'A gift in secret pacifieth anger; and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.',(Prov 21:14) What gifts these are the Scripture everywhere testifies.,"He gave himself, he gave his life, he gave his all for us.","(John 6, Gal 1:4, 1 Tim 2:6, Matt 20:28) These gifts, as he offered them up at the demand of justice on Mount Calvary for us, so now he is in heaven he presenteth them continually before God, as gifts and sacrifice valuable for the sins, for all the sins that we, through infirmity, do commit, from the day of our conversion to the day of our death.","And these gifts are so satisfactory, so prevalent with God, that they always prevail for a continual remission of our sins with him.","Yea, they prevail with him for more than for the remission of sins; we have, through their procurement, our graces often renewed, the devil often rebuked, the snare often broken, guilt often taken away from the conscience, and many a blessed smile from God, and love-look from his life-creating countenance.",(Eph 3:12) 5.,"Since Christ is an Intercessor, I infer that believers should not rest at the cross for comfort; justification they should look for there; but, being justified by his blood, they should ascend up after him to the throne.","At the cross you will see him in his sorrows and humiliations, in his tears and blood; but follow him to where he is now, and then you shall see him in his robes, in his priestly robes, and with his golden girdle about his paps.","Then you shall see him wearing the breastplate of judgment, and with all your names written upon his heart.","Then you shall perceive that the whole family in heaven and earth is named by him, and how he prevaileth with God the Father of mercies, for you.","Stand still awhile and listen; yea, enter with boldness into the holiest, and see your Jesus as he now appears in the presence of God for you; what work he makes against the devil and sin, and death and hell, for you.",(Heb 10:9) Ah!,"it is brave following of Jesus Christ to the holiest, the veil is rent, you may see with open face as in a glass, the glory of the Lord.","This, then, is our High Priest, this his intercession, these the benefits of it!","It lieth on our part to improve it; and wisdom to do that also comes from the mercy-seat, or throne of grace, where he, even our High Priest, ever liveth to make intercession for us; to whom be glory for ever and ever.",[II.,OF THE BENEFITS OF CHRIST'S INTERCESSION.],[SECOND.],"And thus have I spoken to the first thing--to wit, of the intercession of Christ; and now I come more particularly to speak to the second, THE BENEFITS OF HIS INTERCESSION; namely, that we are saved thereby.","Wherefore he is able also to save them, seeing he maketh intercession for them.",'He is able to save them to the uttermost.',"In my handling of this head, I must show you, First, What the apostle means here by 'save'--'Wherefore he is able to save.'","Second, What he means here by saving to the 'uttermost'--'He is able to save to the uttermost.'","Third, And then, thirdly, we shall do as we did in the foregoing--to wit, gather some inferences from the whole, and speak to them.","First, What doth the apostle mean here by 'save'--'He is able to save them.'",To 'save' may be taken two ways.,"In the general, I know it may be taken many ways, for there are many salvations that we enjoy; yea, that we never knew of, nor can know, until we come thither, where all secret things shall be seen, and where that which has been done in darkness shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.",But I say there are two ways that this word may be taken--1.,To save in a way of justification.,2.,Or to save in a way of preservation.,"Now, Christ saves both these ways.","But which of these, or whether both of them are intended in this place, of that I shall tell you my thoughts anon; meanwhile, I will show you, 1.","What it is to be saved in the first sense, [namely, in a way of justification,] and also how that is brought to pass.","To be saved is to be delivered from guilt of sin that is by the law, as it is the ministration of death and condemnation; or, to be set free therefrom before God.","This is to be saved; for he that is not set free therefrom, whatever he may think of himself, or whatever others may think concerning him, he is a condemned man.","It saith not, he shall be, but, he is condemned already.","(John 3:18) The reason is, for that he has deserved the sentence of the ministration of condemnation, which is the law.","Yea, that law has already arraigned, accused, and condemned him before God, for that it hath found him guilty of sin.","Now he that is set free from this, or, as the phrase is, 'being made free from sin,' (Rom 6:22); that is, from the imputation of guilt, there can, to him, be no condemnation, no condemnation to hell fire; but the person thus made free may properly be said to be saved.","Wherefore, as sometimes it saith, we shall be saved, respecting saving in the second sense, or the utmost completing of salvation; so sometimes it saith, we are saved, as respecting our being already secured from guilt, and so from condemnation to hell for sin, and so set safe, and quit from the second death before God.","(1 Cor 1:18, Eph 2:5) Now, saving thus comes to us by what Christ did for us in this world, by what Christ did for us as suffering for us.","I say, it comes to us thus; that is, it comes to us by grace through the redemption that is in Christ.","And thus to be saved is called justification, justification to life, because one thus saved is, as I said, acquitted from guilt, and that everlasting damnation to which for sin he had made himself obnoxious by the law.","(1 Cor 15:1-4, Rom 5:8-10) Hence we are said to be saved by his death, justified by his blood, and reconciled to God by the death of his Son; all which must respect his offering of himself on the day he died, and not his improving of his so dying in a way of intercession, because in the same place the apostle reserveth a second, or an additional salvation, and applieth that to his intercession, 'Much more then, being now,' or already, 'justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him'; that is, through what he will further do for us.","'For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his son, much more, being reconciled,' that is, by his death, 'we shall be saved by his life,' his intercession, which he ever liveth to complete.","(verse 9,10) See here, we are said to be justified, reconciled already, and therefore we shall be saved, justified by his blood and death, and saved through him by his life.",2.,"Now the saving intended in the text is saving in this second sense; that is, a saving of us by preserving us, by delivering of us from all those hazards that we run betwixt our state of justification and our state of glorification.","Yea, such a saving of us as we that are justified need to bring us into glory.","Therefore, When he saith he is able to save, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession, he addeth saving to saving; saving by his life to saving by his death; saving by his improving of his blood to saving by his spilling of his blood.","He gave himself a ransom for us, and now improves that gift in the presence of God by way of intercession.","For, as I have hinted already, the high priests under the law took the blood of the sacrifices that were offered for sin, and brought it within the veil, and there sprinkled it before and upon the mercy-seat, and by it made intercession for the people to an additional way of saving them; the sum of which Paul thus applies to Christ when he saith, 'He can save, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession.'","That also in the Romans is clear to this purpose, 'Who is he that condemneth?",It is Christ that died.',"(Rom 8:31-39) That is, who is he that shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect to condemnation to hell, since Christ has taken away the curse by his death from before God?","Then he adds, that there is nothing that shall yet happen to us, shall destroy us, since Christ also liveth to make intercession for us.",'Who shall condemn?,"It is Christ that died; yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.'","Christ, then, by his death saveth us as we are sinners, enemies, and in a state of condemnation by sin; and Christ by his life saveth us as considered justified, and reconciled to God by his blood.","So, then, we have salvation from that condemnation that sin had brought us unto, and salvation from those ruins that all the enemies of our souls would yet bring us unto, but cannot; for the intercession of Christ preventeth.",4 (Rom 6:7-10) Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law.,"Whatever the law can take hold of to curse us for, that Christ has redeemed us from, by being made a curse for us.","But this curse that Christ was made for us, must be confined to his sufferings, not to his exaltation, and, consequently, not to his intercession, for Christ is made no curse but when he suffered; not in his intercession: so then, as he died he took away the curse, and sin that was the cause thereof, by the sacrifice of himself, (Gal 3:13), and by his life, his intercession, he saveth us from all those things that attempt to bring us into that condemnation again.","The salvation, then, that we have by the intercession of Christ, as was said--I speak now of them that are capable of receiving comfort and relief by this doctrine--is salvation that follows upon, or that comes after, justification.","We that are saved as to justification of life, need yet to be saved with that that preserveth to glory; for though by the death of Christ we are saved from the curse of the law, yet attempts are made by many that we may be kept from the glory that justified persons are designed for; and from these we are saved by his intercession.","A man, then, that must be eternally saved is to be considered, (a.)",As an heir of wrath.,(b.),As an heir of God.,An heir of wrath he is in himself by sin; an heir of God he is by grace through Christ.,"(Eph 2:3, Gal 4:7) Now, as an heir of wrath he is redeemed, and as an heir of God he is preserved; as an heir of wrath he is redeemed by blood, and as an heir of God he is preserved by this intercession.","Christ by his death, then, puts me, I being reconciled to God thereby, into a justified state, and God accepts me to grace and favour through him.","But this doth not hinder but that, all this notwithstanding, there re, that would frustrate me of the end to which I am designed by this reconciliation to God, by redemption through grace; and from the accomplishing of this design I am saved by the blessed intercession of our Lord Jesus Christ.",Object.,1.,"Perhaps some may say, we are not saved from all punishment of sin by the death of Christ; and if so, so not from all danger of damnation by the intercession of Christ.",Answ.,We are saved from all punishment in hell fire by the death of Christ.,Jesus has 'delivered us from the wrath to come.',"(1 Thess 1:10) So that as to this great punishment, God for his sake has forgiven us all trespasses.","(Col 2:13) But we being translated from being slaves to Satan to be sons of God, God reserveth yet this liberty in his hand to chastise us if we offend, as a father chastiseth his son.","(Deut 8:5) But this chastisement is not in legal wrath, but in fatherly affection; not to destroy us, but that still we might be made to get advantage thereby, even be made partakers of his holiness.","This is, that we might 'not be condemned with the world.'","(Heb 12:5-11, 1 Cor 11:32) As to the second part of the objection; there do, as we say, many things happen betwixt or between the cup and the lip; many things attempt to overthrow the work of God, and to cause that we should perish through our weakness, notwithstanding the price that hath by Christ been paid for us.",But what saith the Scripture?,'Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?,"shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?","As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.","Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.","For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.'","(Rom 8:35-39) Thus the apostle reckoneth up all the disadvantages that a justified person is incident to in this life, and by way of challenge declares, that not any one of them, nor all together, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, that is towards us by Christ, his death, and his intercession.",Object.,2.,"It may be further objected, that the apostle doth here leave out sin, unto which we know the saints are subject, after justification.","And sin of itself, we need no other enemies, is of that nature as to destroy the whole world.",Answ.,"Sin is sin, in the nature of sin, wherever it is found.",But sin as to the damning effects thereof is taken away from them unto whom righteousness is imputed for justification.,"Nor shall any or all the things aforementioned, though there is a tendency in every one of them to drive us unto sin, drown us, through it, in perdition and destruction.","I am persuaded, says Paul, they shall never be able to do that.","The apostle, therefore, doth implicitly, though to expressly, challenge sin, yea, sin by all its advantages; and then glorieth in the love of God in Christ Jesus, from which he concludeth it shall never separate the justified.","Besides, it would now have been needless to have expressly here put in sin by itself, seeing before, he had argued that those he speaks of were freely justified therefrom.",One word more before I go to the second head.,"The Father, as I told you, has reserved to himself a liberty to chastise his sons, to wit, with temporal chastisements, if they offend.","This still abideth to us, notwithstanding God's grace, Christ's death, or blessed intercession.","And this punishment is so surely entailed to the transgressions that we who believe shall commit, that it is impossible that we should be utterly freed therefrom; insomuch that the apostle positively concludeth them to be bastards, what pretences to sonship soever they have, that are not, for sin, partakers of fatherly chastisements.","For the reversing of this punishment it is that we should pray, if perhaps God will remit it, when we are taught to say, 'Our Father, forgive us our trespasses.'","And he that admits of any other sense as to this petition, derogates from the death of Christ, or faith, or both.","For either he concludes that for some of his sins Christ did not die, or that he is bound to believe that God, though he did, has not yet, nor will forgive them, till from the petitioner some legal work be done; forgive us, as we forgive them that trespass against us.","(Matt 6:14,15) But now, apply this to temporal punishments, and then it is true that God has reserved a liberty in his hand to punish even the sins of his people upon them; yea, and will not pardon their sin, as to the remitting of such punishment, unless some good work by them be done; 'If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.'","(Matt 6:15, 18:28-35) And this is the cause why some that belong to God are yet so under the afflicting hand of God; they have sinned, and God, who is their Father, punisheth; yea, and this is the reason why some who are dear to God have this kind of punishment never forgiven, but it abides with them to their lives' end, goes with them to the day of their death, yea, is the very cause of their death.",By this punishment they are cut off out of the land of the living.,But all this is that they might 'not be condemned with the world.',(1 Cor 11:32) Christ died not to save from this punishment; Christ intercedes not to save from this punishment.,Nothing but a good life will save from this punishment; nor always that either.,"The hidings of God's face, the harshness of his providences, the severe and sharp chastisements that ofttimes overtake the very spirits of his people, plainly show that Christ died not to save from temporal punishments, prays not to save from temporal punishments--that is, absolutely.","God has reserved a power to punish, with temporal punishments, the best and dearest of his people, if need be.5 And sometimes he remits them, sometimes not, even as it pleases him.",I come now to the second thing.,[Christ saves to the uttermost.],"Second, I shall now show you something of what it is for Christ, by his intercession, to save to the 'uttermost.'",'He is able to save them to the uttermost.',"This is a great expression, and carrrieth with it much.","'Uttermost' signifieth to the outside, to the end, to the last, to the furthest part.",And it hath respect both to persons and things.,"(Gen 49:26, Deut 30:4, Matt 5:26, Mark 13:27, Luke 15) 1.",To persons.,"Some persons are in their own apprehensions even further from Christ than anybody else; afar off, a great way off, yet a-coming, as the prodigal was.","Now, these many times are exceedingly afraid; the sight of that distance that they think is betwixt Christ and them makes them afraid.","As it is said in another case, 'They that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens.'","(Psa 65:8) So these are afraid they shall not speed, not obtain that for which they come to God.","But the text says, He is able to save to the uttermost, to the very hindermost, them that come to God by him.","Two sorts of men seem to be far, very far from God.",(1.),The town sinner.,(2.),The great backslider.,"(Neh 1:9) But both these, if they come, he is able to save to the uttermost.",He is able to save them from all those dangers that they fear will prevent their obtaining of that grace and mercy they would have to help them in time of need.,The publicans and harlots enter into the kingdom of heaven.,2.,"As this text respecteth persons, so it respecteth things.","There are some things with which some are attended that are coming to God, by Christ, that make their coming hard and very difficult.",(1.),There is a more than ordinary breaking up of the corruptions of their nature.,"It seems as if all their lusts and vile passions of the flesh were become masters, and might now do what they will with the soul.","Yea, they take this man and toss and tumble him like a ball in a large place.","This man is not master of himself, of his thoughts, nor of his passions--'His iniquities, like the wind, do carry him away.'","(Isa 64:6) He thinks to go forward, but this wind blows him backward; he laboureth against this wind, but cannot find that he getteth ground; he takes what advantage opportunity doth minister to him, but all he gets is to be beat out of heart, out of breath, out of courage.","He stands still, and pants, and gapeth as for life.","'I opened my mouth, and panted,' said David, 'for I longed for thy commandments.'","(Psa 119:131) He sets forward again, but has nothing but labour and sorrow.",(2.),"Nay, to help forward his calamity, Satan [and his] angels will not be wanting, both to trouble his head with the fumes of their stinking breath, nor to throw up his heels in their dirty places--'And as he was yet a-coming, the devil threw him down and tare him.'","(Luke 9:42) How many strange, hideous, and amazing blasphemies have those, some of those, that are coming to Christ, had injected and fixed upon their spirits against him.","Nothing so common to such, as to have some hellish wish or other against God they are coming to, and against Christ, by whom they would come to him.","These blasphemies are like those frogs that I have heard of, that will leap up, and catch hold of, and hang by their claws.","Now help, Lord; now, Lord Jesus, what shall I do?","Now, Son of David, have mercy upon me!","I say, to say these words is hard work for such an one.",But he is able to save to the uttermost this comer to God by him.,(3.),"There are also the oppositions of sense and reason hard at work for the devil, against the soul; the men of his own house are risen up against him.","One's sense and reason, one would think, should not fall in with the devil against ourselves, and yet nothing more common, nothing more natural, than for our own sense and reason to turn the unnatural, and are both against our God and us.",And now it is hard coming to God.,"Better can a man hear and deal with any objections against himself, than with those that himself doth make against himself.","They lie close, stick fast, speak aloud, and will be heard; yea, will haunt and hunt him, as the devil doth some, in every hole and corner.","But come, man, come; for he is able to save to the uttermost!",(4.),Now guilt is the consequence and fruit of all this; and what so intolerable a burden as guilt!,"They talk of the stones, and of the sands of the sea; but it is guilt that breaks the heart with its burden.","And Satan has the art of making the uttermost of every sin; he can blow it up, make it swell, make every hair of its head as big as a cedar.","He can tell how to make it a heinous offence, and unpardonable offence, an offence of that continuance, and committed against so much light, that, says he, it is impossible it should ever be forgiven.","But, soul, Christ is able to save to the uttermost, he can 'do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.'",(Eph 3:20) (5.),"Join to all this the rage and terror of men, which thing of itself is sufficient to quash and break to pieces all desires to come to God by Christ; yea, and it doth do so to thousands that are not willing to go to hell.","Yet thou art kept, and made to go panting on; a whole world of men, and devils, and sin, are not able to keep thee from coming.","But how comes it to pass that thou art so hearty, that thou settest thy face against so much wind and weather?","I dare say it arises not from thyself, nor from any of thine enemies.","This comes from God, though thou art not aware thereof; and is obtained for thee by the intercession of the blessed Son of God, who is also able to save thee to the uttermost, that comest to God by him.",(6.),"And for a conclusion as to this, I will add, that there is much of the honour of the Lord Jesus engaged as to the saving of the coming man to the uttermost: 'I am glorified in them,' saith he.",(John 17:10) He is exalted to be a Saviour.,"(Acts 5:31) And if the blessed One doth count it an exaltation to be a Saviour, surely it is an exaltation to be a Saviour, and a great one.","'They shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a Saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.'","(Isa 19:20) If it is a glory to be a Saviour, a great Saviour, then it is a glory for a Saviour, a great one, to save, and save, and save to the uttermost--to the uttermost man, to the uttermost sin, to the uttermost temptation.","And hence it is that he saith again, speaking of the transgressions, sins, and iniquities that he would pardon, that it should turn to him for 'a name of joy, a praise, and an honour before all nations.'","(Jer 33:9) He therefore counts it an honour to be a great Saviour, to save men to the uttermost.","When Moses said, 'I beseech thee, show me thy glory,' the answer was, 'I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee.'","(Exo 33:18,19) And when he came indeed to make proclamation, then he proclaimed, 'The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty.'","(Exo 34:6,7) That will by no means clear them that will not come to me that they may be saved.","See here, if it is not by himself accounted his glory to make his goodness, all his goodness, pass before us.","And how can that be, if he saveth not to the uttermost them that come unto God by him?",For goodness is by us noways seen but by those acts by which it expresseth itself to be so.,"And, I am sure, to save, to save to the uttermost, is one of the most eminent expressions by which we understand it is great goodness.","I know goodness has many ways to express itself to be what it is to the world; but then it expresseth its greatness when it pardons and saves, when it pardons and saves to the uttermost.","My goodness, says Christ, extends not itself to my Father, but to my saints.","(Psa 16:2,3) My Father has no need of my goodness, but my saints have, and therefore it shall reach forth itself for their help, in whom is all my delight.","And, 'Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men'!","(Psa 31:19) It is therefore that which tendeth to get Christ a name, a fame, and glory, to be able to save to the uttermost them that come to God by him.","[In Christ's ability to save, lieth our safety.]","But some may say, What is the meaning of this word able?",'Wherefore he is able to save.',He is able to save the uttermost.,"How comes it to pass that his power to save is rather put in than his willingness; for willingness, saith the soul, would better have pleased me.",I will speak two or three words to this question.,"And, First, By this word able is suggested to us the sufficiency of his merit, the great worthiness of his merit; for, as Intercessor, he sticks fast by his merit; all his petitions, prayers, or supplications are grounded upon the worthiness of his person as Mediator, and on the validity of his offering as priest.","This is the more clear, if you consider the reason why those priests and sacrifices under the law could not make the worshippers perfect.","It was, I say, because there wanted in them worthiness and merit in their sacrifices.","But this man, when he came and offered his sacrifice, he did by that one act 'perfect for ever them that are sanctified,' or set apart for glory.","'But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God.'","(Heb 10:1-12) When Moses prayed for the people of Israel, thus he said, 'And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken.'",But what had he spoken?,"'The Lord is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty--Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.'","(Num 14:17-19) Second, Has he but power, we know he is willing, else he would not have promised; it is also his glory to pardon and save.","So, then, in his ability lies our safety.","What if he were never so willing, if he were not of ability sufficient, what would his willingness do?","But he has showed, as I said, his willingness by promising: 'Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.'","(John 6:37) So that now our comfort lies in his power, in that he is able to make good his word.","(Rom 4:20,21) And this also will then be seen, when he hath saved them that come to God by him, when he hath saved them to the uttermost; not to the uttermost of his ability, but to the uttermost of our necessity; for to the uttermost of his ability I believe he will never be put to it to save his church; not for that he is loath so to save, but because there is no need so to save; he shall not need to put out all his power, and to press the utmost of his merit for the saving of his church.",Alas!,there is sufficiency of merit in him to save a thousand times as many more as are like to be saved by him; 'he is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.',"Measure not, therefore, what he can do by what he has, doth, or will do; neither do thou interpret this word, to the uttermost, as if it related to the uttermost of his ability, but rather as it relateth, for so it doth indeed, to the greatness of thy necessity.","For as he is able to save thee, though thy condition be, as it may be supposed to be, the worst that ever man was in that was saved, so he is able to save thee, though thy condition were ten times worse than it is.",What!,shall not the worthiness of the Son of God be sufficient to save from the sin of man?,"or shall the sin of the world be of that weight to destroy, that it shall put Christ Jesus to the uttermost of the worth of his person and merit to save therefrom?",I believe it is blasphemy to think so.,"We can easily imagine that he can save all the world--that is, that he is of ability to do it; but we cannot imagine that he can do no more than we can think he can.",But our imagination and thoughts set no bound to his ability.,'He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.',"But what that is, I say, no man can think, no man can imagine.","So, then, Jesus Christ can do more than ever any man thought he could do as to saving; he can do we know not what.","This, therefore, should encourage comers to come to him; and them that come, to hope.","This, I say, should encourage them to let out, to lengthen, and heighten their thoughts by the word, to the uttermost, seeing he can 'save to the uttermost them that come to God by him.",'6 [Inferences from the benefits of Christ's intercession.],Third.,"And now I come to the third thing that I told you I should speak to, and that is, to those inferences that may be gathered from these words.",1.,Are they that are justified by Christ's blood such as have need yet to be saved by his intercession?,Then from hence it follows that justification will stand with imperfection.,"It doth not therefore follow that a justified man is without infirmity; for he that is without infirmity--that is, perfect with absolute perfection, has no need to be yet saved by an act yet to be performed by a mediator and his mediation.","When I say, justification will stand with imperfection, I do not mean that it will allow, countenance, or approve thereof; but I mean there is no necessity of our perfection, of our personal perfection, as to our justification, and that we are justified without it; yea, that that, in justified persons, remains.","Again; when I say that justification will stand with imperfection, I do not mean that in our justification we are imperfect; for in that we are complete; 'we are complete in him' who is our justice.","(Col 2:10) If otherwise, the imperfection is in the matter that justifieth us, which is the righteousness of Christ.","Yea, and to say so would conclude that wrong judgment proceedeth from him that imputeth that righteousness to us to justification, since an imperfect thing is imputed to us for justification.","But far be it from any that believe that God is true to imagine such a thing; all his works are perfect, there is nothing wanting in them as to the present design.",[Quest.],"But what then do we mean when we say, justification will stand with a state of imperfection?",Answ.,"Why, I mean that justified men are yet sinners in themselves, are yet full of imperfections; yea, sinful imperfections.","Justified Paul said, 'I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.'","(Rom 7:18) While we are yet sinners, we are justified by the blood of Christ.","Hence, again, it is said, 'he justifieth the ungodly.'","(Rom 4:5, 5:8,9) Justification, then, only covereth our sin from the sight of God; it maketh us not perfect with inherent perfection.","But God, for the sake of that righteousness which by his grace is imputed to us, declareth us quit and discharged from the curse, and sees sin in us no more to condemnation.",[WHY THE JUSTIFIED NEED AN INTERCESSOR.],"And this is the reason, or one reason, why they that are justified have need of an intercessor--to wit, to save us from the evil of the sin that remains in our flesh after we are justified by grace through Christ, and set free from the law as to condemnation.","Therefore, as it is said, we are saved; so it is said, 'He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.'","The godly, for now we will call them the godly, though there is yet abundance of sin in them, feel in themselves many things even after justification by which they are convinced they are still attended with personal, sinful imperfections.",[Imperfect in their feelings and inclinations.]--(1.),"They feel unbelief, fear, mistrust, doubting, despondings, murmurings, blasphemies, pride, lightness, foolishness, avarice, fleshly lusts, heartlessness to good, wicked desires, low thoughts of Christ, too good thoughts of sin, and, at times, too great an itching after the worst of immoralities.",(2.),"They feel in themselves an aptness to incline to errors, as to lean to the works of the law for justification;

and to save him from the destroying evil of these, Christ ever liveth to make intercession for him.",[Imperfect in their graces.],"--Again; the justified man is imperfect in his graces, and therefore needeth to be saved by the intercession of Christ from the bad fruit that that imperfection yields.",Justifying righteousness is accompanied with graces--the graces of the Spirit.,"Though these graces are not that matter by and through which we are justified, nor any part thereof, that being only the obedience of Christ imputed to us of mere pleasure and good will; but, I say, they come when justification comes.","(Rom 9) And though they are not so easily discerned at the first, they show forth themselves afterwards.","But I say, how many soever they are, and how fast soever they grow, their utmost arrivement here is but a state short of perfection.","None of the graces of God's Spirit in our hearts can do their work in us without shortness, and that because of their own imperfections, and also because of the oppositions that they meet with from our flesh.",(1.),"Faith, which is the root-grace, the grand grace, its shortness is sufficiently manifest by its shortness of apprehension of things pertaining to the person, offices, relations, and works of Christ, now in the heavenly place for us.","It is also very defective in its fetching of comfort from the Word to us, and in continuing of it with us, when at any time we attain unto it; in its receiving of strength to subdue sin, and in its purifyings of the heart, though indeed it doth what it doth in reality, yet how short is it of doing of it thoroughly?","Oftentimes, were it not for supplies by virtue of the intercession of Christ, faith would fail of performing its office in any measure.","(Luke 22:31,32) (2.)","There is hope, another grace of the Spirit bestowed upon us; and how often is that also, as to the excellency of working, made to flag?","'I shall perish,' saith David; 'I am cut off from before thine eyes,' said he.","(Psa 31:22) And now where was his hope, in the right gospel discovery of it?","Also all our fear of men, and fears of death, and fears of judgment, they arise from the imperfections of hope.",But from all those faults Christ saves us by his intercessions.,(3.),"There is love, that should be in us as hot as fire.","It is compared to fire, to fire of the hottest sort; yea, it is said to be hotter than the coals of juniper.","(Cant 8:6,7) But who finds this heat in love so much as for one poor quarter of an hour together?","Some little flashes, perhaps, some at some times may feel, but where is that constant burning of affection that the Word, the love of God, and the love of Christ call for?","yea, and that the necessities of the poor and afflicted members of Christ call for also.",Ah!,"love is cold in these frozen days, and short when it is at the highest.",(4.),"The grace of humility, when is it?",who has a thimbleful thereof?,"Where is he that is 'clothed with humility,' and that does what he is commanded 'with all humility of mind'?","(1 Peter 5:5, Acts 20:19) (5.)","For zeal, where is that also?","Zeal for God against sin, profaneness, superstition, and idolatry.","I speak now to the godly, who have this zeal in the root and habit;

to find a mouth without fraud and deceit now is a rare thing.,"Thus might one count up all the graces of the Spirit, and show wherein every one of them are scanty and wanting of perfection.","Now look, what they want of perfection is supplied with sin and vanity; for there is a fullness of sin and flesh at hand to make up all the vacant places in our souls.","There is no place in the souls of the godly but it is filled up with darkness when the light is wanting, and with sin so far forth as grace is wanting.","Satan, also, diligently waiteth to come in at the door, if Careless has left it a little achare.7 But, oh!","the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who ever liveth to make intercession for us, and that, by so doing, saves us from all the imperfect acts and workings of our graces, and from all the advantages that flesh, and sin, and Satan getteth upon us thereby.",[Imperfect in their Duties.],"--Further, as Christ Jesus our Lord doth save us, by his intercession, from that hurt that would unavoidably come upon us by these, so also, by that we are saved from the evil that is at any time found in any or all our holy duties and performances that is our duty daily to be found in.","That our duties are imperfect, follows upon what was discoursed before;

which, had it been bestowed well in time, might have been a succour and nourishment to some poor member of Christ?",(3.),"There is hearing of the Word; but, alas!",the place of hearing is the place of sleeping with many a fine professor.,"I have often observed that those that keep shops can briskly attend upon a twopenny customer; but when they come themselves to God's market, they spend their time too much in letting their thoughts to wander from God's commandments, or in a nasty drowsy way.","The heads, also, and hearts of most hearers are to the Word as the sieve is to water; they can hold no sermons, remember no texts, bring home no proofs, produce none of the sermon to the edification and profit of others.","And do not the best take up too much in hearing, and mind too little what, by the Word, God calls for at their hands, to perform it with a good conscience?",(4.),"There is faithfulness in callings, faithfulness to brethren, faithfulness to the world, faithfulness to children, to servants, to all, according to our place and capacity.",Oh!,"how little of it is there found in the mouths and lives, to speak nothing of the hearts, of professors.","I will proceed no further in this kind of repetition of things;

and by that also you shall be secured from those dangers, if not temptations to dangers, that those that go out about business in their own names and strength shall be sure to meet withal.",4.,"Are those that are justified by the blood of Christ such as, after that, have need of being saved by Christ's intercession?","Then, hence I infer again, that God has a great dislike of the sins of his own people, and would fall upon them in judgment and anger much more severely than he doth, were it not for Christ's intercession.","The gospel is not, as some think, a loose and licentious doctrine, nor God's discipline of his church a negligent and careless discipline; for, though those that believe already have also an intercessor, yet God, to show his detestation against sin, doth often make them feel to purpose the weight of his fingers.","The sincere, that fain would walk oft with God, have felt what I say, and that to the breaking of their bones full oft.","The loose ones, and those that God loves not, may be utter strangers as to this; but those that are his own indeed do know it is otherwise.9 'You only have I known' above all others, says God, 'therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.'",(Amos 3:2) God keeps a very strict house among his children.,"David found it so, Haman found it so, Job found it so, and the church of God found it so; and I know not that his mind is ever the less against sin, notwithstanding we have an Intercessor.","True, our Intercessor saves us from damning evils, from damning judgments; but he neither doth nor will secure us from temporal punishment, from spiritual punishment, unless we watch, deny ourselves, and walk in his fear.","I would to God that those who are otherwise minded did but feel, for three or four months, something of what I have felt for several years together for base sinful thoughts!","I wish it, I say, if it might be for their good, and for the better regulating of their understandings.","But whether they obtain my wish or no, sure I am that God is no countenancer of sin; no, not in his own people; nay, he will bear it least of all in them.","And as for others, however he may for a while have patience towards them, if, perhaps, his goodness may lead them to repentance; yet the day is coming when he will pay the carnal and hypocrites' home with devouring fire for their offences.","But if our holy God will not let us go altogether unpunished, though we have so able and blessed an Intercessor, that has always to present God with, on our behalf, so valuable a price of his own blood, now before the throne of grace, what should we have done if there had been no day's-man, none to plead for us, or to make intercession on our behalf?","Read that text, 'For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee; though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.'","(Jer 30:11) If it be so, I say, what had become of us, if we had had no Intercessor?","And what will become of them concerning whom the Lord has said already, 'I will not take up their names into my lips'?",(Psa 16:4) 'I pray not for the world.',(John 17:9) 5.,Are those that are already justified by the blood of Christ yet such as have need of being saved by his intercession?,"Then, hence, I infer that Christ is not only the beginner, but the completer of our salvation; or, as the Holy Ghost calls him, 'the author and finisher of our faith,' (Heb 12:2); or, as it calls him again, 'the author of eternal salvation.'","(Heb 5:9) Of salvation throughout, from the beginning to the end, from first to last.","His hands have laid the foundation of it in his own blood, and his hands shall finish it by his intercession.","(Zech 4:9) As he has laid the beginning fastly, so he shall bring forth the headstones with shoutings, and we shall cry, Grace, grace, at the last, salvation only belongeth to the Lord.","(Zech 4:7, Psa 3:8, Isa 43:11) Many there be that begin with grace, and end with works, and think THAT is the only way.","Indeed works will save from temporal punishments, when their imperfections are purged from them by the intercession of Christ; but to be saved and brought to glory, to be carried through this dangerous world, from my first moving after Christ till I set my foot within the gates of paradise, this is the work of my Mediator, of my high priest and intercessor; it is he that fetches us again when we are run away; it is he that lifteth us up when the devil and sin has thrown us down; it is he that quickeneth us when we grow cold; it is he that comforteth us when we despair; it is he that obtains fresh pardon when we have contracted sin; and he that purges our consciences when they are loaden with guilt.","(Eze 34:16, Psa 145:14) I know also, that rewards do wait for them in heaven that do believe in Christ, and shall do well on earth; but this is not a reward of merit, but of grace.","We are saved by Christ; brought to glory by Christ; and all our works are no otherwise made acceptable to God but by the person and personal excellencies and works of Christ; therefore, whatever the jewels are, and the bracelets, and the pearls, that thou shalt be adorned with as a reward of service done to God in the world, for them thou must thank Christ, and, before all, confess that he was the meritorious cause thereof.","(1 Peter 2:5, Heb 13:15) He saves us, and saves our services too.","(Rev 5:9-14) They would be all cast back as dung in our faces, were they not rinsed and washed in the blood, were they not sweetened and perfumed in the incense, and conveyed to God himself through the white hand of Jesus Christ; for that is his golden-censer; from thence ascends the smoke that is in the nostrils of God of such a sweet savour.","(Rev 7:12-14, 8:3,4) 6.","Are those that are already justified by the blood of Christ, such as do still stand in need of being saved by his intercession?","Then hence I infer again, that we that have been saved hitherto, and preserved from the dangers that we have met with since our first conversion to this moment, should ascribe the glory to Jesus Christ, to God by Jesus Christ.","'I have prayed that thy faith fail not: I pray that thou wouldest keep them from the evil,' is the true cause of our standing, and of our continuing in the faith and holy profession of the gospel to this very day.","Wherefore we must give the glory of all to God by Christ: 'I will not trust in my bow,' said David, 'neither shall my sword save me.","But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.","In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.",Selah'!,'He always causeth us to triumph in Christ.',"'We rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.'","(Psa 44:6-8, 2 Cor 2:14, Phil 3:3) Thus you see that, both in the Old and New Testament, all the glory is given to the Lord, as well for preservation to heaven as for justification of life.","And he that is well acquainted with himself will do this readily; though light heads, and such as are not acquainted with the desperate evil that is in their natures, will sacrifice to their own net.",But such will so sacrifice but a while.,"Sir Death is coming, and he will put them into the view of what they see not now, and will feed sweetly upon them, because they made not the Lord their trust.","And therefore, ascribe thou the glory of the preservation of thy soul in the faith hitherto, to that salvation which Christ Jesus our Lord obtaineth for thee by his intercession.",7.,Are those that are already justified by the blood of Christ such as do still stand in need of being saved by his intercession?,"Then is this also to be inferred from hence, that saints should look to him for that saving that they shall yet have need of betwixt this and the day of their dissolution; yea, from henceforward, even to the day of judgment.","I say, they should still look to him for the remaining part of their salvation, or for that of their salvation which is yet behind; and let them look for it with confidence, for that it is in a faithful hand; and for thy encouragement to look and hope for the completing of thy salvation in glory, let me present thee with a few things-- (1.)","The hardest or worst part of the work of thy Saviour is over; his bloody work, his bearing of thy sin and curse, his loss of the light of his Father's face for a time; his dying upon the cursed tree, that was the worst, the sorest, the hardest, and most difficult part of the work of redemption; and yet this he did willingly, cheerfully, and without thy desires; yea, this he did, as considering those for whom he did it in a state of rebellion and enmity to him.",(2.),"Consider, also, that he has made a beginning with thy soul to reconcile thee to God, and to that end has bestowed his justice upon thee, put his Spirit within thee, and began to make the unweldable mountain and rock,10 thy heart, to turn towards him, and desire after him; to believe in him, and rejoice in him.",(3.),"Consider, also, that some comfortable pledges of his love thou hast already received, namely, as to feel the sweetness of his love, as to see the light of his countenance, as to be made to know his power in raising of thee when thou wast down, and how he has made thee stand, while hell has been pushing at thee, utterly to overthrow thee.",(4.),"Thou mayest consider, also, that what remains behind of the work of thy salvation in his hands, as it is the most easy part, so the most comfortable, and that part which will more immediately issue in his glory, and therefore he will mind it.",(5.),"That which is behind is also more safe in his hand than if it were in thine own; he is wise, he is powerful, he is faithful, and therefore will manage that part that is lacking to our salvation well, until he has completed it.","It is his love to thee that has made him that 'he putteth no trust in thee'; he knows that he can himself bring thee to his kingdom most surely; and therefore has not left that work to thee, no, not any part thereof.","(Job 5:18, 15:15) Live in hope, then, in a lively hope, that since Christ is risen from the dead, he lives to make intercession for thee, and that thou shalt reap the blessed benefit of this twofold salvation that is wrought, and that is working out for thee, by Jesus Christ our Lord.","And thus have we treated of the benefit of his intercession, in that he is able to save to the uttermost.",And this leads me to the third particular.,[III.,THE PERSONS INTERESTED IN THE INTERCESSION OF CHRIST.],"THIRD, The third particular is to show WHO ARE THE PERSONS INTERESTED IN THIS INTERCESSION OF CHRIST; and they are those that come to God by him.","The words are very concise, and distinctly laid down; they are they that come, that come to God, that come to God by him.","'Wherefore he is able also to save them, to save to the uttermost them that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.'",[Of coming to God by Christ.],"--A little, first, to comment upon the order of the words, 'that come unto God by him.'","There are that come unto God, but not 'by him'; and these are not included in this text, have not a share in this privilege.","Thus the Jews came to God, the unbelieving Jews, 'who had a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.'","(Rom 9:30-34, 10:1-4) These submitted not to Christ, the righteousness of God, but thought to come to him by works of their own, or at least, as it were, by them, and so came short of salvation by grace, for that reigns to salvation only in Christ.","To these Christ's person and undertaking were a stumbling stone; for at him they stumbled, and did split themselves to pieces, though they indeed were such as came to God for life.","As there are that come to God, but not by Christ, so there are that come to Christ, but not to God by him:11 of this sort are they, who hearing that Christ is Saviour, therefore come to him for pardon, but cannot abide to come to God by him, for that he is holy, and so will snub their lusts, and will change their hearts and natures.",Mind me what I say.,"There are a great many that would be saved by Christ, but love not to be sanctified by God through him.","These make a stop at Christ, and will go no further.","Might such have pardon, they care not whether ever they went to heaven or no.","Of this kind of coming to Christ I think it is, of which he warneth his disciples when he saith, 'In that day ye shall ask me nothing.","Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.'","(John 16:23) As who should say, when you ask for anything, make not a stop at me, but come to my Father by me; for they that come to me, and not to my Father, through me, will have nothing of what they come for.","Righteousness shall be imputed to us, 'if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.'","(Rom 4:24,25) To come to Christ for a benefit, and stop there, and not come to God by him, prevaileth nothing.",Here the mother of Zebedee's children erred; and about this it was that the Lord Jesus cautioned her.,"Lord, saith she, 'Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.'",But what is the answer of Christ?,"'To sit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give, but for whom it is prepared of my Father.'","(Matt 20:21-23) As who should say, Woman, of myself I do nothing, my Father worketh with me.","Go therefore to him by me, for I am the way to him; what thou canst obtain of him by me thou shalt have; that is to say, what of the things that pertain to eternal life, whether pardon or glory.","It is true, the Son has power to give pardon and glory, but he gives it not by himself, but by and according to the will of his Father.","(Matt 9:6, John 17:22) They, therefore, that come to him for an eternal good, and look not to the Father by him, come short thereof; I mean, now, pardon and glory.","And hence, though it be said the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins--to wit, to show the certainty of his Godhead, and of the excellency of his mediation; yet forgiveness of sin is said to lie more particularly in the hand of the Father, and that God for Christ's sake forgiveth us.","(Eph 4:32) The Father, as we see, will not forgive unless we come to him by the Son.","Why, then, should we conceit that the Son will forgive these that come not to the Father by him?","So then, justifying righteousness is in the Son, and with him also is intercession; but forgiveness is with the Father; yea, the gift of the Holy Ghost, yea, and the power of imputing of the righteousness of Christ is yet in the hand of the Father.","Hence Christ prays to the Father to forgive, prays to the Father to send the Spirit, and it is God that imputeth righteousness to justification to us.","(Luke 23:34, John 14:16, Rom 4:6) The Father, then, doth nothing but for the sake of and through the Son; the Son also doth nothing derogating from the glory of the Father.","But it would be a derogation to the glory of the Father if the Son should grant to save them that come not to the Father by him; wherefore you that cry Christ, Christ, delighting yourselves in the thoughts of forgiveness, but care not to come by Christ to the Father for it, you are not at all concerned in this blessed text, for he only saves by his intercession them that come to God by him.","There are three sorts of people that may be said to come to Christ, but not to God by him.",1.,They whose utmost design in coming is only that guilt and fear of damning may be removed from them.,And there are three signs of such an one--(1.),"He that takes up in a belief of pardon, and so goes on in his course of carnality as he did before.",(2.),"He whose comfort in the belief of pardon standeth alone, without other fruits of the Holy Ghost.",(3.),"He that, having been washed, can be content to tumble in the mire, as the sow again, or as the dog that did spue to lick up his vomit again.",2.,"They may be said to come to Christ, but not to God by him, who do pick and choose doctrines, itching only after that which sounds of grace,12 but secretly abhorring of that which presseth to moral goodness.","These did never see God, what notions soever they may have of the Lord Jesus, and of forgiveness from him.",(Matt 5:8) 3.,"They surely did never come to God by Christ, however they may boast of the grace of Christ, that will from the freeness of gospel grace plead an indulgence for sin.",[Manner of coming to God.],"--And now to speak a few words of coming to God, or coming as the text intends.","And in speaking to this, I must touch upon two things--1.",Concerning God.,2.,Concerning the frame of the heart of him that comes to him.,1.,Of God.,God is the chief good.,Good so as nothing is but himself.,"He is in himself most happy;

how much more happy is the man that has interest in God.,"God alone is able by himself to put the soul into a more blessed, comfortable, and happy condition than can the whole world; yea, and more than if all the created happiness of all the angels of heaven did dwell in one man's bosom.","God is the upholder of all creatures, and whatever they have that is a suitable good to their kind, it is from God; by God all things have their subsistence, and all the good that they enjoy.",I cannot tell what to say; I am drowned!,"The life, the glory, the blessedness, the soul-satisfying goodness that is in God is beyond all expression.",2.,Now there must be in us something of a suitableness of spirit to this God before we can be willing to come to him.,"Before, therefore, God has been with a man, and has left some impression of his glory upon him, that man cannot be willing to come to him aright.","Hence it is said concerning Abraham, that, in order to his coming to God, and following of him aright, the Lord himself did show himself unto him--'Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, and said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.'","(Acts 7:2,3, Gen 12:1) It was this God of glory, the sight and visions of this God of glory, that provoked Abraham to leave his country and kindred to come after God.","The reason why men are so careless of, and so indifferent about, their coming to God, is because they have their eyes blinded, because they do not perceive his glory.","God is so blessed a one, that did he not hide himself and his glory, the whole world would be ravished with him.","But he has, I will not say reasons of state, but reasons of glory, glorious reasons why he hideth himself from the world, and appeareth but to particular ones.","Now by his thus appearing to Abraham, down fell Abraham's vanity, and his idolatrous fancies and affections, and his heart began to turn unto God, for that there was in this appearance an alluring and soul-instructing voice.","Hence that which Moses calls here an appearing, Christ calls a hearing, and a teaching, and a learning--'It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.","Every man, therefore, that hath heard and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me,' that is, to God by me.","But, I say, what must they hear and learn of the Father but that Christ is the way to glory, the way to the God of glory.","This is a drawing doctrine; wherefore that which in this verse is called teaching and learning, is called, in the verse before, the drawing of the Father--'No man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him'; that is, with powerful proposals, and alluring conclusions, and heart-subduing influences.","(John 6:44,45) Having thus touched upon this, we will now proceed to show you what kind of people they are that come to God by Christ; and then shall draw some inferences from this also.",[Who are the people that come to Christ.],"There are, therefore, three sorts of people that come to God by Christ.","First, Men newly awakened.","Second, Men turned from backsliding.","Third, The sincere and upright man.",[Of the newly awakened coming to Christ.],"First, Men newly awakened.","By awakened, I mean awakened thoroughly.","So awakened as to be made to see themselves, what they are; the world, what it is; the law, what it is; hell, what it is; death, what it is; Christ, what he is; and God, what he is; and also what judgment is.","A man that will come to God by Christ aright must needs, precedent to his so coming, have a competent knowledge of things of this kind.",1.,"He must know himself, what a wretched and miserable sinner he is, before he will take one step forward in order to his coming to God by Christ.","This is plain from a great many scriptures;

and it is not the righteous, but the sinners that do well know themselves to be such, that come to God by Christ.","It is not in the power of all the men on earth to make one man come to God by Christ, because it is not in their power to make men see their state by nature.","And what should a man come to God for, that can live in the world without him?","Reason says so, experience says so, the Scripture beareth witness that so it is of a truth.","It is a sight of what I am that must unroost me, that must shake my soul, and make me leave my present rest.","No man comes to God by Christ but he that knows himself, and what sin hath done to him; that is the first.",(Job 21:7-15) 2.,"As he must know himself, and what a wretch he is, so he must know the world, and what an empty thing it is.","Cain did see himself, but saw not the emptiness of this world; and therefore instead of going to God by Christ, he went to the world, and there did take up to his dying day.","(Gen 4:16) The world is a great snare to the soul, even to the souls of awakened sinners, by reason of its big looks, and the fair promises that it makes to those that will please to entertain it.","It will also make as though it could do as much to the quieting of the spirit as either sermon, Bible, or preacher.","Yea, and it has its followers ready at its heels continually to blow its applause abroad, saying, 'Who will show us any [other] good?'",(Psa 4:6) and though 'this their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings.',"(Psa 49:13) So that unless a man, under some awakenings, sees the emptiness of the world, he will take up in the good things thereof, and not come to God by Christ.",Many there be now in hell that can seal to this for truth.,"It was the world that took awakened Cain, awakened Judas, awakened Demas.","Yea, Balaam, though he had some kind of visions of God, yet was kept by the world from coming to him aright.","See with what earnestness the young man in the gospel came to Jesus Christ, and that for eternal life.","He ran to him, he kneeled down to him, and asked, and that before a multitude, 'Good master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?'","(Mark 10:17-24) And yet when he was told he could not come, the world soon stepped betwixt that life and him, and persuaded him to take up in itself; and so, for aught we know, he never looked after life more.","There are four things in the world that have a tendency to lull an awakened man asleep, if God also makes him not afraid of the world.",(1.),"There is the bustle and cumber of the world, that will call a man off from looking after the salvation of his soul.",This is intimated by the parable of the thorny ground.,"(Luke 8:14) Worldly cumber is a devilish thing; it will hurry a man from his bed without prayer; to a sermon, and from it again, without prayer; it will choke prayer, it will choke the Word, it will choke convictions, it will choke the soul, and cause that awakening shall be to no saving purpose.",(2.),"There is the friendship of this world, to which, if a man is not mortified, there is no coming for him to God by Christ.",And a man can never be mortified to it unless he shall see the emptiness and vanity of it.,Whosoever makes himself a friend of this world is the enemy of God.,"And how, then, can he come to him by Christ?",(James 4:4) (3.),"There are the terrors of the world, if a man stands in fear of them, he also will not come to God by Christ.",The fear of man brings a snare.,"How many have, in all ages, been kept from coming to God aright by the terrors of the world?","Yea, how many are there to one's thinking have almost got to the gates of heaven, and have been scared and driven quite back again by nothing but the terrors of this world?","This is that which Christ so cautioneth his disciples about, for he knew it was a deadly thing.",Peter also bids the saints beware of this as of a thing very destructive.,"(Luke 12:4-6, 1 Peter 3:14,15) (4.)","There is also the glory of the world, an absolute hindrance to convictions and awakenings, to wit, honours, and greatness, and preferments: 'How can ye believe,' said Christ, 'which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only.'","(John 5:44) If therefore a man is not in his affections crucified to these, it will keep him from coming to God aright.",3.,"As a man must know himself, how vile he is, and know the world, how empty it is, so he must know the law, how severe it is; else he will not come to God by Jesus Christ our Lord.","A man that is under awakenings, is under a double danger of falling short of coming to God by Christ.","If he knows not the severity of the law, he is either in danger of slighting its penalty, or of seeking to make amends to it by doing of good works; and nothing can keep him from splitting his soul upon one of these two rocks, but a sound knowledge of the severity of the law.",(1.),He is in danger of slighting the penalty.,This is seen by the practice of all the profane in the world.,Do they not know the law?,"Verily, many of them can say the Ten Commandments without book.","But they do not know the severity of the law; and therefore when at any time awakenings come upon their consciences, they strive to drive away the guilt of one sin, by wallowing in the filth of another.",But would they do thus if they knew the severity of the law?,they would as soon eat fire.,"The severity of the law would be an intolerable, insupportable burden to their consciences; it would drive them, and make them fly for refuge, to lay hold on the hope set before them.",(2.),"Or if he slights not the penalty, he will seek to make amends to it by doing of good works for the sins he has committed.","This is manifest by the practice of the Jews and Turks, and all that swerve on that hand--to wit, to seek life and happiness by the law.",Paul also was here before he meet with Jesus in the way.,"This is natural to consciences that are awakened, unless also they have given to them to see the true severity of the law; the which that thou mayest do, if my mite will help, I will cast in for thy conviction these four things-- (a.)","The law charges thee with its curse, as well for the pollution of thy nature, as for the defilements of thy life; yea, and if thou hadst never committed sinful act, thy pollution of nature must stand in thy way to life, if thou comest not to God for mercy by Christ.",(b.),"The law takes notice of, and chargeth thee with its curse, as well for sinful thoughts as for vile and sinful actions.","'The [very] thought of foolishness is sin,' (Prov 24:9), though it never breaks out into act, and will as surely merit the damnation of the soul as will the greatest transgression in the world.","(c.) If now thou couldst keep all the commandments, that will do thee no good at all, because thou hast sinned first: 'The soul that sinneth shall die.'","Unless, then, thou canst endure the curse, and so in a legal way overcome it for the sins that thou hast committed, thou art gone, if thou comest not to God by Christ for mercy and pardon.","(d.) And never think of repentance, thereby to stop the mouth of the law; for the law calleth not for repentance, but life; nor will it accept of any, shouldst thou mourn and weep for thy sins till thou hast made a sea of blood with tears.","This, I say, thou must know, or thou wilt not come to God by Christ for life.","For the knowledge of this will cause that thou shalt neither slight the severity of the law, nor trust to the works thereof for life.","Now, when thou doest neither of these, thou canst not but speed thee to God by Christ for life; for now thou hast no stay; pleasures are gone, all hope in thyself is gone.","Thou now diest, and that is the way to love; for this inward death is, or feels like, a hunger-bitten stomach, that cannot but crave and gape for meat and drink.","Now it will be as possible for thee to sleep with thy finger in the fire, as to forbear craving of mercy so long as this knowledge remains.",4.,"As a man must know himself, the emptiness of this world, and the law, so it is necessary for him to know that there is a hell, and how insupportable the torments of it are; for all threatenings, curses, and determinations to punish in the next world will prove but fictions and scarecrows, if there be no woeful place, no woeful state, for the sinner to receive his wages in for sin, when his days are ended in this world.","Wherefore, this word 'saved' supposeth such a place and state.","He is able to save from hell, from the woeful place, from the woeful state of hell, them that come unto God by him.","Christ, therefore, often insinuated the truth of a hell in his invitations to the sinners of this world to come to him; as where he tells them they shall be saved if they do, they shall be damned if they do not.","As if he had said, there is a hell, a terrible hell, and they that come to me I will save them from it; but they that come not, the law will damn them in it.","Therefore, that thou mayest indeed come to God by Christ for mercy, believe there is a hell, a woeful, terrible place.","Hell is God's creature, 'he hath made it deep and large'!","The punishments are by the lashes of his wrath, which will issue from his mouth like a stream of burning brimstone, ever kindling itself upon the soul.","(Isa 30:33) Thou must know this by the Word, and fly from it, or thou shalt know it by thy sins, and lie and cry in it.","I might enlarge, but if I did, I should be swallowed up; for we are while here no more able to set forth the torments of hell, than we are whole here to set forth the joys of heaven; only this may, and ought to be said, that God is able, as to save, so to cast into hell.","(Luke 12:5) And as he is able to make heaven sweet, good, pleasurable, and glorious beyond thought; so he is able to make the torments of hell so exquisite, so hot, so sharp, so intolerable, that no tongue can utter it, no, not the damned in hell themselves.","(Isa 64:4) If thou lovest thy soul, slight not the knowledge of hell, for that, with the law, are the spurs which Christ useth to prick souls forward to himself withal.",What is the cause that sinners can play so delightfully with sin?,"It is for that they forget there is a hell for them to descend into for their so doing, when they go out of this world.",For here usually he gives our stop to a sinful course; we perceive that hell hath opened her mouth before us.,"Lest thou shouldst forget, I beseech thee, another time, to retain the knowledge of hell in thine understanding, and apply the burning-hot thoughts thereof to thy conscience; this is one way to make thee gather up thy heels, and mend thy pace in thy coming to Jesus Christ, and to God the Father by him.13 5.","It is also necessary that he that cometh to God by the Lord Jesus, should know what death is, and the uncertainty of its approaches upon us.","Death is, as I may call it, the feller, the cutter down.","Death is that that puts a stop to a further living here, and that which lays man where judgment finds him.","If he is in the faith in Jesus, it lays him down there to sleep till the Lord comes; if he be not in the faith, it lays him down in his sins till the Lord comes.","(Heb 11:13, 1 Thess 4:14, Job 20:11) Again; if thou hast some beginnings that look like good, and death should overtake thee before those beginnings are ripe, thy fruit will wither, and thou wilt fall short of being gathered into God's barn.","Some men are 'cut off as the tops of the ears of corn,' and some are even nipped by death in the very bud of their spring; but the safety is when a man is ripe, and shall be gathered to his grave, as a shock of corn to the barn in its season.","(Job 24:20-24, 5:26) Now if death should surprise and seize thee before thou art fit to die, all is lost; for there is no repentance in the grave, or rather, as the wise man has it, 'Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.'","(Eccl 9:10) Death is God's sergeant, God's bailiff, and he arrests in God's name when he comes, but seldom gives warning before he clappeth us on the shoulder; and when he arrests us, though he may stay a little while, and give us leave to pant, and tumble, and toss ourselves for a while upon a bed of languishing, yet at last he will prick our bladder, and let out our life, and then our soul will be poured upon the ground, yea, into hell, if we are not ready and prepared for the life everlasting.","He that doth not watch for, and is not afraid lest death should prevent him, will not make haste to God by Christ.","What Job said of temporal afflictions, such an one will death be if thou art not aware--'When I looked for good, then evil came--The days of affliction prevented me.'","(Job 30:26,27) If thou lookest, or beginnest to look for good, and the day of death shall cut thee off before thou hast found that good thou lookest for, all is lost, soul, and life, and heaven, and all.","Wherefore it is convenient that thou conclude the grave is thy house, and that thou make thy bed once a day in the grave; also that thou say unto corruption, 'Thou art my father; to the worm, thou art my mother and my sister.'","(Job 17:13,14) I say, be acquainted with the grave and death.","The fool puts the evil day far away, but the wise man brings it nigh.","Better be ready to die seven years before death comes, than want one day, one hour, one moment, one tear, one sorrowful sigh at the remembrance of the ill-spent life that I have lived.","This, then, is that which I admonish thee of; namely, that thou know death, what it is, what it doth when it comes.","Also, that thou consider well of the danger that death leaves that man in, to whom he comes before he is ready and prepared to be laid by it in the grave.",6.,Thou must also be made by thy awakenings to see what Christ is.,"This is of absolute necessity; for how can or shall a man be willing to come to Christ that knows not what he is, what God has appointed him to do?","He is the Saviour, every man will say so; but to sense, smell, and taste, what saving is, and so to understand the nature of the office and work of a Saviour, is a rare thing, kept close from most, known but by some.",Jesus of Nazareth is the Saviour or the reconciler of men to God in the body of his flesh through death.,(Col 1:19-21) This is he whose business in coming from heaven to earth was to save his people from their sins.,"Now, as was said, to know how he doth this, is that which is needful to be inquired into; for some say he doth it one way, some, he doth it another; and it must be remembered that we are now speaking of the salvation of that man that from new or first awakenings, is coming to God by Christ for life.",(1.),"Some say he doth it, by giving of us precepts and laws to keep, that we might be justified thereby.",(2.),"Some say that he doth it, by setting himself a pattern for us to follow him.(3.)","Some again hold, that he doth it by our following the light within.","But thou must take heed of all these, for he justifies us by none of these means, and thou dost need to be justified.","I say, he justifieth us, not either by giving laws unto us, or by becoming our example, or by our following of him in any sense, but by his blood shed for us.","His blood is not laws, nor ordinances, nor commandments, but a price, a redeeming price.","(Rom 5:7-9, Rev 1:5) He justifies us by bestowing upon us, not by expecting from us; he justifies us by his grace, not by our works.","(Eph 1:7) In a word, thou must be well grounded in the knowledge of what Christ is, and how men are justified by him, or thou wilt not come unto God by him.","As thou must know him, and how men are justified by him, so thou must know the readiness that is in him to receive and to do for those what they need that come unto God by him.","Suppose his merits were never so efficacious, yet if it could be proved that there is a loathness in him that these merits should be bestowed upon the coming ones, there would but few adventure to wait upon him.","But now, as he is full, he is free.",Nothing pleases him better than to give what he has away; than to bestow it upon the poor and needy.,And it will be convenient that thou who art a coming soul shouldst know this for thy comfort to encourage thee to come to God by him.,"Take two or three sayings of his, for the confirming of what is now said.","'Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.'",(Matt 11:28) 'All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.',"(John 6:37) 'I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.'","(Mark 2:17) 'This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.'",(1 Tim 1:15) 7.,"As a man that would come to God by Christ must, antecedent to his so coming, know himself, what he is; the world, how empty it is; the law, how severe it is; death, and what it is; and Christ, and what he is; so also he must know God.","'He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.'","(Heb 11:6) God must be known, else how can the sinner propound him as his end, his ultimate end?",For so doth every one that indeed doth come to Christ aright; he comes to Christ because he is the way; he comes to God because he is the end.,"But, I say, if he knows him not, how can he propound him as the end?","The end is that for the sake of which I propound to myself anything, and for the sake of which I use any means.","Now, then, I would be saved; but why?",Even because I would enjoy God.,I use the means to be saved; and why?,Because I would enjoy God.,"I am sensible that sin has made me come short of the glory of God, and that Christ Jesus is he, the only he, that can put me into a condition of obtaining the glory of God; and, therefore, I come to God by him.","(Rom 3:23, 5:1,2) But, I say again, who will propound God for his end that knows him not, that knows him not aright?","yea, that knows him not, to be worth being propounded as my end in coming to Jesus Christ; and he that thus knows him must know him to be above all, best of all, and him in whom the soul shall find that content, that bliss, that glory and happiness that can by no means be found elsewhere.","And, I say, if this be not found in God, the soul will never propound him to itself as the only, highest, and ultimate end in its coming to Jesus Christ.","But it will propound something else, even what it shall imagine to be the best good; perhaps heaven, perhaps ease from guilt, perhaps to be kept out of hell, or the like.","I do not say but a man may propound all these to himself, in his coming to Jesus Christ; but if he propound these as his ultimate end, as the chiefest good that he seeks; if the presence and enjoyment of God, of God's glorious majesty, be not his chief design, he is not concerned in the salvation that is propounded in our text--'He is able,' and so will 'save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him.'",What is heaven without God?,what is ease without the peace and enjoyment of God?,what is deliverance from hell without the enjoyment of God?,"The propounding, therefore, these, and only these, to thyself for thy happiness in thy coming to Jesus Christ is a proposal not a hair's breadth higher than what a man without grace can propound.",What or who is he that would not go to heaven?,What or who is he that would not also have ease from the guilt of sin?,And where is the man that chooseth to go to hell?,"But many there be that cannot abide God; no, they like not to go to heaven, because God is there.","If the devil had a heaven to bestow upon men, a vicious and a beastly heaven, if it be lawful thus to speak, I durst pawn my soul upon it, were it a thousand times better than it is, that, upon a bare invitation, the foul fiend would have twenty to God's one.","They, I say, cannot abide God; nay, for all, the devil has nothing but a hell for them; yet how thick men go to him, but how thinly to God Almighty.",The nature of God lieth cross to the lusts of men.,"A holy God, a glorious holy God, an infinitely holy God, this spoils all.","But to the soul that is awakened, and that is made to see things as they are; to him God is what he is in himself, the blessed, the highest, the only eternal good, and he without the enjoyment of whom all things would sound but emptily in the ears of that soul.","Now, then, I advise thee that hast a mind to come to God by Christ, that thou seek the knowledge of God--'If thou seekest wisdom as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures, then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.'","(Prov 2:4,5) And to encourage thee yet further, he is so desirous of communion with men, that he pardoneth sins for that.","Hence he is called not only loving, but love.","'God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.'","(1 John 4:16) Methinks, when I consider what glory there is at times upon the creatures, and that all their glory is the workmanship of God; O Lord, say I, what is God himself?","He may well be called the God of glory, as well as the glorious Lord; for as all glory is from him, so in him is an inconceivable well-spring of glory, of glory to be communicated to them that come by Christ to him.","Wherefore, let the glory, and love, and bliss, and eternal happiness that is in God allure thee to come to him by Christ.",8.,"As thou shouldst, nay, must, have a good knowledge of all these, so thou must have it of judgment to come.","They that come to God by Christ are said to 'flee from the wrath to come'; to 'flee for refuge, to lay hold on the hope set before them.'","(Matt 3:7, Heb 6:18) This judgment to come is a warm thing to be thought of, an awakening thing to be thought of; it is called the eternal judgment, because it is and will be God's final conclusion with men.","This day is called the 'great and notable day of the Lord,' (Acts 2:20); the day 'that shall burn like an oven,' (Mal 4:1); the day in which the angels shall gather the wicked together, as tares, into bundles, to burn them; but the rest, into his kingdom and glory.","This day will be it in which all the bowels of love and compassion shall be shut up to the wicked, and that in which the floodgates of wrath shall be opened, by which shall a plentiful reward be given to evil-doers, but glory to the righteous.","(Psa 31:23) This is the day in which men, if they could, would creep into the ground for fear; but because they cannot, therefore, they will call and cry to the mountains to fall upon them, but they shall not; therefore, they stand bound to bear their judgment.","This day will be the day of breaking up of closet-councils, cabinet-councils, secret purposes, hidden thoughts; yea, 'God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing.'","(Eccl 12:14) I say he shall do it then; for he will both 'bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the heart.'","(1 Cor 4:5) This is the day that is appointed to put them to shame and contempt in that have, in this world, been bold and audacious in their vile and beastly ways.","At this day, God will cover all such bold and brazen faces with shame.",Now they will blush till the blood is ready to burst through their cheeks.,(Dan 12:2) Oh!,"the confusion and shame that will cover their faces while God is discovering to them what a nasty, what a beastly, what an uncomely, and what an unreasonable life they lived in the world.","They shall now see they contemned God, that fed them, that clothed them, that gave them life and limb, and that maintained their breath in their nostrils.","But, oh, when they see the gulf before them, and all things ready to receive them in thither; then, then they will know what sinning against God means!","And, I say, thou that art for coming to God by Christ must know this, and be well assured of this, or thou wilt never come to God by him.","What of the glory of God shall be put upon them that do indeed come to him will also help in this spiritual journey, if it be well considered by thee.","But, perhaps, terror and unbelief will suffer thee to consider but little of that.","However, the things afore-mentioned will be goads, and will serve to prick thee forward; and if they do so, they will be God's great blessing unto thee, and that for which thou wilt give him thy thanks for ever.","(Eccl 12:10,11) Thus I have, in few words, spoken something as to the first sort of comers to God by Christ, namely, of the coming of the newly-awakened man.","And I say again, if any of the things afore-named be wanting, and are not with his heart, it is a question whether, notwithstanding all the noise that he may make about religion, he will ever come to God by Christ.",1.,"If he knows not himself and the badness of his condition, wherefore should he come?",2.,"If he knows not the world, and the emptiness and vanity thereof, wherefore should he come?",3.,"If he knows not the law, and the severity thereof, wherefore should he come?",4.,"If he knows not hell, and the torments thereof, wherefore should he come?",5.,"If he knows not what death is, wherefore should he come?",6.,"And if he knows not the Father and the Son, how can he come?",7.,And to know that there is a judgment to come is as necessary to his coming as most of the rest of the things propounded.,"Coming to God by Christ is for shelter, for safety, for advantage, and everlasting happiness.","But he that knows not, that understands not the things afore-mentioned, sees not his need of taking shelter, of flying for safety, of coming for advantage to God by Christ.","I know there are degrees of this knowledge, and he that has it most warm upon him, in all likelihood, will make most haste; or, as David saith, will hasten his escape 'from the windy storm and tempest'; and he that sees least is in most danger of being the loiterer, and so of losing the prize; for all that run do not obtain it; all that fight do not win it; and ALL that strive for it have it not.","(Psa 55:8, 1 Cor 9:24-26, 2 Tim 2:4,5) [Of the backslider's return to Christ.]","Second, I shall now come to the second man mentioned; to wit, the man that is turning back from his backsliding, and speak something also about his coming again to God by Christ.",There are two things remarkable in the returning of a backslider to God by Christ.,1.,"The first is, he gives a second testimony to the truth of all things spoken of before.",2.,He also gives a second testimony of the necessity of coming to God by Christ.,Of the manner of his coming to God by Christ perhaps I may also speak a word or two.,"But, 1.","The returning again of the backslider gives a second testimony to the truth of man's state being by nature miserable, of the vanity of this world, of the severity of the law, certainty of death, and terribleness of judgment to come.","His first coming told them so, but his second coming tells them so with a double confirmation of the truth.","It is so, saith his first coming.",Oh!,"it is so, saith his second.","The backsliding of a Christian comes through the overmuch persuading of Satan and lust, that the man was mistaken, and that there was no such horror in the things from which he fled, nor so much good in the things to which he hasted.","Turn again, fool, says the devil, turn again to thy former course; I wonder what frenzy it was that drove thee to thy heels, and that made thee leave so much good behind thee, as other men find in the lusts of the flesh and the good of the world.","As for the law, and death, and an imagination of the day of judgment, they are but mere scarecrows, set up by politic heads, to keep the ignorant in subjection.","Well, says the backslider, I will go back again and see; so, fool as he is, he goes back, and has all things ready to entertain him; his conscience sleeps, the world smiles, flesh is sweet, carnal company compliments him, and all that can be got is presented to this backslider to accommodate him.","But, behold, he doth again begin to see his own nakedness, and he perceives that the law is whetting his axe.","As for the world, he perceives it is a bubble; he also smells the smell of brimstone, for God hath scattered it upon his tabernacle, and it begins to burn within him.",(Job 18:15) Oh!,"saith he, I am deluded; oh!",I am ensnared.,My first sight of things was true.,I see it is so again.,"Now he begins to be for flying again to his first refuge; O God, saith he, I am undone, I have turned from thy truth to lies!","I believed them such at first, and find them such at last.","Have mercy upon me, O God!","This, I say, is a testimony, a second testimony, by the same man, as to the miserable state of man, the severity of the law, the emptiness of the world, the certainty of death, and the terribleness of judgment.","This man hath seen it, and seen it again.","A returning backslider is a great blessing, I mean intended to be so, to two sorts of men--1.",To the elect uncalled.,2.,"To the elect that are called, and that at present stand their ground.","The uncalled are made to hear him, and consider; the called are made to hear him, and are afraid of falling.","Behold, therefore, the mystery of God's wisdom, and how willing he is that spectators should be warned and made take heed.","Yea, he will permit that some of his own shall fall into the fire, to convince the world that hell is hot, and to warn their brethren to take heed that they slip not with their feet.","I have often said in my heart that this was the cause why God suffered so many of the believing Jews to fall; to wit, that the Gentiles might take heed.","(Rom 11:21) O, brethren!","saith the backslider that is returned, did you see how I left my God?",did you see how I turned again to those vanities from which some time before I fell?,O!,"I was deluded, I was bewitched, I was deceived; for I found all things from which I fled at first still worse by far when I went to them the second time.",Do not backslide.,Oh!,do not backslide.,the first ground of your departing from them was good; never tempt God a second time.,2.,"And as he gives us a second testimony, that the world and himself are so as at first he believed they were, so by this his returning he testifies that God and Christ are the same, and much more than ever he believed at first they were.",This man has made a proof before and a proof after conviction of the evil of the one and good of the other.,"This man has made a proof by feeling and seeing, and that before and after grace received.","This man God has set up to be a witness; this man is two men, has the testimony of two men, must serve in the place of two men.",He knows what it is to be fetched from a state of nature by grace; but this all Christians know as well as he.,"Ay, but he knows what it is to be fetched from the world, from the devil, and hell, the second time; and that but few professors know, for few that fall away return to do again.","(Heb 6:4-8) Ay, but this man is come again, wherefore there is news in his mouth, sad news, dreadful news, and news that is to make the standing saint to take heed lest he fall.","The returning backslider, therefore, is a rare man, a man of worth and intelligence, a man to whom the men of the world should flock, and of whom they should learn to fear the Lord God.","He also is a man of whom the saints should receive both caution, counsel, and strength in their present standing; and they should, by his harms, learn to serve the Lord with fear, and to rejoice with trembling.","(1 Cor 10:6-13, Isa 51:11-13, Luke 22:32) This man has the second time also had a proof of God's goodness in his Christ unto him, a proof which the standing Christian has not--I would not tempt him that stands to fall; but the good that a returning backslider has received at God's hands, and at the hand of Christ, is a double good, he has been converted twice, fetched from the world, and from the devil, and from himself twice; oh, grace!","and has been made to know the stability of God's covenant, the unchangeableness of God's mind, the sure and lasting truth of his promise in Christ, and of the sufficiency of the merits of Christ, over and over.",[The manner of a backslider's return.],--Of the manner of this man's coming to God by Christ I shall also speak a word or two.,"He comes as the newly-awakened sinner comes, and that from the same motives and the knowledge of things as he hath over and above (which he had as good have been without), that which the newly-awakened sinner has not; to wit, the guilt of his backsliding, which is a guilt of a worse complexion, of a deeper dye, and of a heavier nature than is any guilt else in the world.",He is also attended with fears and doubts that arise from other reasons and considerations than do the doubts and fears of the newly-awakened man; doubts builded upon the vileness of his backsliding.,"He has also more dreadful scriptures to consider of, and they will look more wishfully in his face, yea, and will also make him take notice of their grim physiognomy, than has the newly-awakened man.","Besides, as a punishment of his backsliding, God seems to withdraw the sweet influences of his Spirit, and as if he would not suffer him to pray, nor to repent any more, (Psa 51:11), as if he would now take all away from him, and leave him to those lusts and idols that he left his God to follow.","Swarms of his new rogueries shall haunt him in every place, and that not only in the guilt, but in the filth and pollution of them.","(Prov 14:14) None know the things that haunt a backslider's mind, his new sins are all turned talking devils, threatening devils, roaring devils, within him.","Besides, he doubts of the truth of his first conversion, consequently he has it lying upon him as a strong suspicion that there was nothing of truth in all his first experience; and this also adds lead to his heels, and makes him come, as to sense and feeling, more heavy and with the greater difficulty to God by Christ.","As faithfulness of other men kills him, he cannot see an honest, humble, holy, faithful servant of God, but he is pierced and wounded at the heart.","Ay, says he within himself, that man fears God, that man hath faithfully followed God, that man, like the elect angels, has kept his place; but I am fallen from my station like a devil.","That man honoureth God, edifieth the saints, convinceth the world, and condemneth them, and is become heir of the righteousness which is by faith.","But I have dishonoured God, stumbled and grieved saints, made the world blaspheme, and, for aught I know, been the cause of the damnation of many!","These are the things, I say, together with many more of the same kind, that come with him; yea, they will come with him, yea, and will stare him in the face, will tell him of his baseness, and laugh him to scorn, all the way that he is coming to God by Christ--I know what I say!--and this makes his coming to God by Christ hard and difficult to him.","Besides, he thinks saints will be aware of him, will be shy of him, will be afraid to trust him, yea, will tell his Father of him, and make intercession against him, as Elias did against Israel, (Rom 11:2), or as the men did that were fellow-servants with him that took his brother by the throat.","(Matt 18:31) Shame covereth his face all the way he comes; he doth not know what to do; the God he is returning to, is the God that he has slighted, the God before whom he has preferred the vilest lust; and he knows God knows it, and has before him all his ways.","The man that has been a backslider, and is returning to God, can tell strange stories, and yet such as are very true.","No man was in the whale's belly, and came out again alive, but backsliding and returning Jonah; consequently, no man could tell how he was there, what he felt there, what he saw there, and what workings of heart he had when he was there, so well as he.",[The sincere Christian's coming to God by Christ.],"Third, I come now to the third man--to wit, to the sincere and upright man that cometh to God by Christ.","And although this may, in some sense, be applicable to the two former, for his coming is not worthy to be counted coming to God, that is, not in sincerity and uprightness, yet by such an one I now mean, one that has been called to the faith, and that has in some good measure of sincerity and uprightness therein abode with God.","This man also comes to God by Christ; but his coming is to be distinguished, I mean in the main of it, from the coming of the other two.","The other come for the knowledge of forgiveness, a thing that the upright and faithful Christian for the most part has a comfortable faith of, and that for which he is often helped to give thanks to God.","I do not say he doubteth not, or that he has not his evidences sometimes clouded; nor do I say that the knowledge of his reconciliation to God by Christ Jesus is so high, so firm, so fixed, and steadfast, that it cannot be shaken, or that he needs no more.",I will then explain myself.,"He comes not to God as an unconverted sinner comes; he comes not as a backslider comes when he is returning to God from his backslidings; but he comes as a son, as one of the household of God, and he comes as one that has not, since correction, wickedly departed from his God.",1.,"He then comes to God with that access and godly boldness that is only proper to such as himself, that is, to them that walk with God.",(Rom 5:2) Thus every one that shall be saved doth not do; thus every one that shall be saved cannot do--to instance the two spoken of before.,2.,"He comes to God by Christ constantly by prayer, by meditation, by every ordinance.","For therefore he maketh use of ordinances, because by them through Christ he getteth into the presence of God.",(Psa 27:4) 3.,"He comes to God through Christ, because he judgeth that God only is that good, that blessedness, that happiness, that is worth looking after; that good and that blessedness that alone can fill the soul to the brim; that good and that happiness that is worthy of our hearts and souls and spirits.","Hence David expresseth his coming to God by panting, by thirsting, by tears, saying, 'My soul panteth after thee, O God.'","And again, 'My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God, when shall I come and appear before God?'","(Psa 42:1,2) And again, 'I will go to the altar of God, unto God, my exceeding joy.'","(Psa 43:4) And hence it was that he so envied the swallow and sparrow, even because they could come to the altar of God, where he had promised to give his presence, when he, as I think, by the rage of Saul, was forced to abide remote.","'My soul longeth,' saith he, 'yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.","Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God: Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, they will be still praising thee.'","Then after a few more words he saith, 'For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand.","I had rather be a doorkeeper,' I would choose rather to sit at the threshold of thy house, 'than to dwell in the tents of wickedness'; and then renders the reason--'For the Lord is a sun and shield: the Lord gives grace and glory,' &c. (Psa 84) The presence of God, and the glory and soul-ravishing goodness of that presence, is a thing that the world understands not, nor can they as such desire to know what it is.",4.,These good men come to God upon other accounts also; for so it is that they have many concerns with God.,[Concern for themselves.]--(1.),"They come to him for a more clear discovery of themselves to themselves, for they desire to know how frail they are, because the more they know that, the more they are engaged in their souls to take heed to their ways, and to fear lest they should tempt their God to leave them.",(Psa 39:1-8) (2.),"They come to God by Christ for the weakening of their lusts and corruptions; for they are a sore, yea, a plague to a truly sanctified soul.","Those, to be rid of which, if it might be, a godly man chooseth rather to die than to live.",This David did mean when he cried.,"'Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me,' (Psa 51:10); and Paul, when he cried out, 'O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?'",(Rom 7:24) (3.),They come to God by Christ for the renewing and strengthening of their graces.,"The graces that the godly have received are, and they feel they are, subject to decay; yea, they cannot live without a continual supply of grace.","This is the meaning of that, 'Let us have grace,' and, 'Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'",(Heb 4:16) (4.),They come to God by Christ to be helped against those temptations that they may meet withal.,"(Matt 6:13) They know that every new temptation has a new snare and a new evil in it; but what snare and what evil, that at present they know not; but they know their God knows, and can deliver out of temptation when we are in, and keep us out while we are out.",(5.),"They come to God by Christ for a blessing upon that means of grace which God has afforded for the succour of the soul, and the building of it up in the faith; knowing that as the means, so a blessing upon it, is from God.","(2 Thess 3:1) And for this they have encouragement, because God has said, 'I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.'",(Psa 132:15) (6.),"They come to God by Christ for the forgiveness of daily infirmities, (Psa 19:12), and for the continuing them in the light of his countenance notwithstanding.","Thus he also would always accept them and their services, and grant that an answer of peace may be returned from their Father into their bosoms; for this is the life of their souls.","There are a great many such things that the sincere and upright man comes to God for, too many here to mention.","But again, [Concern for the church and others.]--(1.)","This man also comes to God to beseech him for the flourishing of Christ's kingdom, which he knows will never be until Antichrist is dead, and till the Spirit be more plentifully poured upon us from on high.","Therefore he also cries to God for the downfall of the first, and for the pouring out of the other.",(2.),He comes to God for the hastening the gathering in of his elect; for it is an affliction to him to think that so many of those for whom Christ died should be still in a posture of hostility against him.,(Psa 122:6) (3.),"He comes to God for a spirit of unity to be poured out among believers, for, for the divisions of Reuben he has great thoughts of heart.",(4.),"He comes to God to pray for magistrates, and that God would make speed to set them all to that work that is so desirable to his church--that is, to 'hate the whore,' 'to eat her flesh,' to 'make her desolate,' 'and burn her with fire.'","(1 Tim 2:1, Rev 17:16) (5.)","He comes to God to beg that he would hasten that great and notable day, the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus, for he knows that Christ will never be exalted as he must be till then; yea, he also knows that God's church will never be as she would, and shall, till then.",(Rev 22:20) (6.),"But the main meaning, if I may so call it, of this high text is this, that they that come to God by him--that is, by Christ, are those that come by Christ to God to enjoy him by faith and spirit here, and by open vision and unspeakable possession of him in the next world.","This is the great design of the soul in its coming to God by Jesus Christ, and it comes to him by Jesus Christ because it dares not come by itself, and because God himself has made him the way, the new and living way.","Here, as I said, the Father meets with that which pleaseth him, and the soul with that which saveth her.","Here is righteousness and merits to spare, even righteousness that can justify the ungodly.","Here is always, how empty soever we be, a fullness of merit always presented to God by Christ for my obtaining of that which at any time I want, whether wisdom, grace, Spirit, or any good thing soever; only, since I was upon this subject, I thought a little to touch upon things in this order, for the enlarging of thy thoughts, for the conviction of thy spirit, for the stirring of thee up to God, and for the showing of thee the good signs of grace where it is, where is abused, and where any are seeking after it.",[Inferences from thus coming to God by Christ.],"And now I come to draw some inferences from this point also, as I have already done from those going before it.","You see that I have now been speaking to you of the man that cometh to God, both with respect to the way he comes, as also with respect to the manner of spirit in which he comes; and hence I may well infer, First, That he is no fool, no fool according to the best judgment, that cometh to God by Christ.","The world indeed will count him one; for the things that be of the Spirit of God are foolishness to them; but indeed, and in the verdict of true judgment, he is not so.",1.,For that he now seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.,"He has chosen to be concerned with the very head and fountain of wisdom; for Christ is the wisdom of God, and the way to the Father by Christ, is the greatest of mysteries; and to choose to walk in that way, the fruits of the most sage advice; wherefore he is not a fool that thus concerns himself.","(Prov 18:1, 1 Cor 1) 2.","It is not a sign of foolishness timely to prevent ruin, is it?","They are the prudent men that foresee an evil, and hide themselves; and the fools, that go on, and are punished.","(Prov 18:8, 27:12) Why, this man foresees an evil, the greatest evil, sin, and the punishment of the soul for sin in hell; and flies to Christ, who is the refuge that God has provided for penitent sinners; and is this a sign of a fool?","God make me such a fool, and thee that readest these lines such a fool, and then we shall be wiser than all men that are counted wise by the wisdom of this world.","Is it a sign of a fool to agree with one's adversary while we are in the way with him, even before he delivereth us to the judge?","Yea, it is a piece of the highest wisdom.","Is he a fool that chooseth for himself long lasters, or he whose best things will rot in a day?","Sinners, 'before your pots can feel the thorns [before you can see where you are], God shall take you away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.'","(Psa 58:9) But this man has provided for things; like the tortoise, he has got a shell on his back, so strong and sound that he fears not to suffer a loaden cart to go over him.","The Lord is his rock, his defence, his refuge, his high tower, unto which he doth continually resort.",Was the unjust steward a fool in providing for himself for hereafter?,for providing friends to receive him to harbour when others should turn him out of their doors?,"(Luke 16:8,9) No more is he that gets another house for his harbour before death shall turn him out of doors here.",3.,"As he that cometh to God by Christ is no fool, so he is no little-spirited fellow.","There are a generation of men in this world that count themselves men of the largest capacities, when yet the greatness of their desires lift themselves no higher than to things below.","If they can, with their net of craft and policy, encompass a bulky lump of earth, oh what a treasure have they engrossed to themselves!","Meanwhile, the man in the text has laid siege to heaven, has found out the way to get into the city, and is resolved, in and by God's help, to make that his own.",Earth is a drossy thing in this man's account; earthly greatness and splendours are but like vanishing bubbles in this man's esteem.,"None but God, as the end of his desires, none but Christ, as the means to accomplish this his end, are things counted great by this man.","No company now is acceptable to this man but the Spirit of God, Christ and angels, and saints, as fellow-heirs with himself.",All other men and things he deals with as strangers and pilgrims were wont to do.,This man's mind soars higher than the eagle or stork of the heavens.,"He is for musing about things that are above, and their glory, and for thinking what shall come to pass hereafter.",4.,"But as I have showed you what he is not, so now let me, by a few words, tell you what he is.",(1.),"Then he is a man concerned for his soul, for his immortal soul.","The soul is a thing, though of most worth, least minded by most.",The souls of most lie waste while all other things are enclosed.,"But this man has got it by the end, that his soul is of more value than the world, wherefore he is concerned for his soul.","Soul concerns are concerns of the highest nature, and concerns that arise from thoughts most deep and ponderous.",He never yet knew what belonged to great and deep thoughts that is a stranger to soul concerns.,"Now the man that comes to God by Christ, is a man that is engaged in soul concerns.",(2.),"He is a man whose spirit is subjected to a suitableness to spiritual things, for a carnal mind cannot suit with and be delighted in these things: 'The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.'","(Rom 8:7) This is the man that God has tamed, and keeps tame by himself, while all other run wild, as the assess upon the mountains.","If birds could speak, surely they would tell that those that are kept in the cage have with them another temper than they that range the air, and fly in the fields and woods.","Yea, and could those kept tame express themselves to the rest, they would tell that they have white bread and milk, and sugar; while those without make a life out of maggots and worms.","They are also in place where there are better things, and their companions are the children of men; besides, they learn such notes, and can whistle such tunes, as other birds are strangers to.",Oh!,"the man whose spirit is subjected to God, betwixt whom and God there is a reconciliation, not only as to a difference made up, but also as to a oneness of heart; none knows what lumps of sugar God gives that man, nor what notes and tunes God learns that man: 'He hath put a new song in my mouth,' saith David, 'even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.'",(Psa 40:3) Second.,Is there a man that comes to God by Christ?,Thence I infer that there is that believes there is a world to come.,No man looks after that which yet he believes is not; faith must be before coming to Christ will be; coming is the fruit of faith.,"He that comes must believe antecedent to his coming; wherefore it is said, 'we walk by faith'--that is, we come to God through Christ by faith.","(Heb 11:7, 2 Cor 5:7) And hence I learn two things:--1.",That faith is of a strong and forcible quality.,2.,That they who come not to God by Christ have no faith.,1.,"Faith is of a strong and forcible quality, and that whether it be true or false.",(1.),"A false faith has done great things; it has made men believe lies, plead for them, and stand to them, to the damnation of their souls.","'God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie,' to their damnation.","(2 Thess 2:11,12) Hence it is said, men make lies 'their refuge.'",Why?,Because they 'trust in a lie.',"(Jer 28:15) A lie, if believed, if a man has faith in it, it will do great things, because faith is of a forcible quality.","Suppose thyself to be twenty miles from home, and there some man comes and possesses thee that thy house, thy wife and children, are all burned with the fire.","If thou believest it, though indeed there should be nothing of truth in what thou hast heard, yet will this lie 'drink up thy spirit,' even as if the tidings were true.",How many are there in the world whose heart Satan hath filled with a belief that their state and condition for another world is good?,"and these are made to live by lying hope that all shall be well with them, and so are kept from seeking for that which will make them happy indeed.","Man is naturally apt and willing to be deceived, and therefore a groundless faith is the more taking and forcible.","Fancy will help to confirm a false faith, and so will conceit and idleness of spirit.","There is also in man a willingness to take things upon trust, without searching into the ground and reason of them.","Nor will Satan be behind hand to prompt and encourage to thy believing of a lie, for that he knows will be a means to bring thee to that end to which he greatly desireth thou shouldst come.","Wherefore let men beware, and, oh, that they would, of a false and lying faith!",(2.),"But if a false faith is so forcible, what is a true?","What force, I say, is there in a faith that is begotten by truth, managed by truth, fed by truth, and preserved by the truth of God?","This faith will make invisible things visible; not fantastically so, but substantially so--'Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.'","(Heb 11:1) True faith carrieth along with it an evidence of the certainty of what it believeth, and that evidence is the infallible Word of God.","There is a God, a Christ, a heaven, saith the faith that is good, for the Word of God doth say so.","The way to this God and this heaven is by Christ, for the Word of God doth say so.","If I run not to this God by this Christ, this heaven shall never be my portion, for the Word of God doth say so.","So, then, thus believing makes the man come to God by him.","His thus believing, then, it is that carries him away from this world, that makes him trample upon this world, and that gives him the victory over this world.","'For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.","Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?","This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood.","And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.'",(1 John 5:4-6) 2.,"Now if this be true, that faith, true faith, is so forcible a thing as to take a man from his seat of ease, and make him to come to God by Christ as afore, then, is it not truly inferred from hence that they that come not to God by Christ have no faith.",What!,"is man such a fool as to believe things, and yet not look after them?","to believe great things, and yet not to concern himself with them?","Who would knowingly go over a pearl, and yet not count it worth stooping for?","Believe thou art what thou art; believe hell is what it is; believe death and judgment are coming, as they are; and believe that the Father and the Son are, as by the Holy Ghost in the Word they are described, and sit still in thy sins if thou canst.",Thou canst not sit still; faith is forcible.,"Faith is grounded upon the voice of God in the Word, upon the teaching of God in the Word.","And it pleases God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe; for believing makes them heartily close in with, and embrace what by the Word is set before them, because it seeth the reality of them.","Shall God speak to man's soul, and shall not man believe?","Shall man believe what God says, and nothing at all regard it?",It cannot be.,"'Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.'","And we know that when faith is come, it purifies the heart of what is opposite to God, and the salvation of the soul.","So, then, those men that are at ease in a sinful course, or that come not to God by Christ, they are such as have no faith, and must therefore perish with the vile and unbelievers.",(Rev 21:8) The whole world is divided into two sorts of men--believers and unbelievers.,"The godly are called believers; and why believers, but because they are they that have given credit to the great things of the gospel of God?","These believers are here in the text called also comers, or they that come to God by Christ, because whoso believes will come; for coming is a fruit of faith in the habit, or, if you will, it is faith in exercise; yet faith must have a being in the soul before the soul can put it into act.","This therefore further evidences that they that come not, have no faith, are not believers, belong not to the household of faith, and must perish--'For he that believes not, shall be damned.'","Nor will it be to any boot14 to say, I believe there is a God and a Christ, for still thy sitting still doth demonstrate that either thou liest in what thou sayest, or that thou believest with a worse than a false faith.",But the object of my faith is true.,"I answer, so is the object of the faith of devils; for they believe that there is one God and one Christ, yet their faith, as to the root and exercise of it, is notwithstanding no such faith as is that faith that saves, or that is intended in the text, and that by which men come to God through Christ.","Wherefore still, oh, thou slothful one, thou deceivest thyself!","Thy not coming to God by Christ declareth to thy face that thy faith is not good, consequently, that thou feedest on ashes, and thy deceived heart has turned thee aside, that thou canst not deliver thy soul, nor say, 'Is there not a lie in my right hand?'",(Isa 44:20) Third.,Is there a man that comes to God by Christ?,"Thence I infer that the world to come is better than this; yea, so much better as to quit cost and bear charges of coming to God, from this, by Christ, to that.","Though there is a world to come, yet if it were no better than this, one had as good stay here as seek that, or if it were better than this, and would bear charges if a man left this for that, and that was all, still the one would be as good as the other.","But the man that comes to God by Christ, has chosen the world that is infinitely good; a world, betwixt which and this there can be no comparison.","This must be granted, because he that comes to God by Christ is said to have made the best choice, even chose a city that has foundations.","(Heb 11:10) There are several things that make it manifest enough that he that comes to God by Christ has made the best market, or chose the best world.",1.,"That is the world which God commendeth, but this that that he slighteth and contemneth.","(2 Thess 1:5,6) Hence that is called the kingdom of God, but this an 'evil world.'","(Gal 1:4) Now let us conclude, that since God made both, he is able to judge which of the two are best; yea, best able so to judge thereof.","I choose the rather to refer you to the judgment of God in this matter, for should I put you upon asking of him as to this, that is, coming to God by Christ, perhaps you would say, he is as little able to give an account of this matter as yourselves.","But I hope you think God knows, and therefore I refer you to the judgment of God, which you have in the Scriptures of truth--'Heaven is his throne, and the earth is his footstool.'",I hope you will say here is some difference.,"The Lord is the God of that, the devil the god and prince of this.",Thus also it appears there is some difference between them.,2.,"That world, and those that are counted worthy of it, shall all be everlasting;

there will be no cessation of joys, nor any speck of pollution.","'In thy presence is fullness of joy, at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.'",(Psa 16:11) 4.,"There men shall be made like angels, 'neither can they die any more.'","(Luke 20:35,36) There shall they behold the face of God and his Son, and swim in the enjoyment of them for ever.",5.,"There men shall see themselves beyond all misery, and shall know that it will be utterly impossible that either anything like sorrow, or grief, or sickness, or discontent, should touch them more.",6.,"There men shall be rewarded of God for what they have done and suffered according to his will for his sake;

yea, 'In that day the Lord of hosts himself shall be for a crown of glory to those that are his people.'","(Heb 2:7, Isa 28:5, 35:10, Psa 103:4) Now, if this world, though no more could be said of it that is said in these few lines, is not infinitely far better than what the present world is, I have missed it in my thoughts.","But the coming man, the man that comes to God by Christ, is satisfied, knows what he does; and if his way, all his way thither, were strewed with burning coals, he would choose, God helping him, to tread that path rather than to have his portion with them that perish.","Fourth, If there be a world to come, and such a way to it so safe and good, and if God is there to be enjoyed by them that come to him by Christ; then this shows the great madness of the most of men, madness, I say, of the highest degree, for that they come not to God by Christ that they may be inheritors of the world to come.","It is a right character which Solomon gives of them, 'The heart,' saith he, 'of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.'","(Eccl 9:3) A madman is intent upon his toys, upon anything but that about which he should be intent; and so are they that come not to God by Jesus Christ.","A madman has neither ears to hear, nor a heart to do, what they that are in their right wits advise him for the best, no more have they that come not to God by Christ.","A madman sets more by the straws and cock's feathers by which he decks himself, than he does by all the pearls and jewels in the world.","And they that come not to God by Christ set more by the vanishing bubbles of this life than they do by that glory that the wise man shall inherit; 'The wise shall inherit glory, but shame,' says Solomon, 'shall be the promotion of fools.'",What a shame it is to see God's jewels lie unregarded of them that yet think none are wiser than themselves.,"I know the wise men of this world will scorn one should think of them that they are mad; but verily it is so, the more wise for this world, the more fool in God's matters; and the more obstinately they stand in their way, the more mad.","When Solomon gave himself to backsliding, he saith he gave himself to folly and madness.","(Eccl 1:17, 2:12) And when he went about to search out what man is since the fall, he went about to search out foolishness and madness.","(Eccl 7:25-29) And is it not said, that when the Jews were angry with Jesus for that he did good on the Sabbath, that that anger did flow from their being filled with madness?","Doth not Paul also, while he opposed himself against Christ, the gospel, and professors thereof, plainly tell us that he did it even from the highest pitch of madness?","'And being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.'","(Acts 26:11) Now if it is exceeding madness to do thus, how many at this day must be counted exceeding mad, who yet count themselves the only sober men?","They oppose themselves, they stand in their own light, they are against their own happiness, they cherish and nourish cockatrices in their own bosoms; they choose to themselves those paths which have written upon them in large characters, These are the ways of death and damnation.","They are offended with them that endeavour to pull them out of their ditch, and choose rather to lie and die there than to go to God by Christ that they may be saved from wrath through him; yea, so mad are they, that they count the most sober, the most godly, the most holy man, the mad one; the more earnest for life, the more mad; the more in the Spirit, the more mad; the more desirous to promote the salvation of others, the more mad.","But is not this a sign of madness, of madness unto perfection?","And yet thus mad are many, and mad are all they that while it is called to-day, while their door is open, and while the golden sceptre of the golden grace of the blessed God is held forth, stand in their own light, and come not to God by Christ.","(John 10:20, Acts 26:24) That is the fourth inference.","Fifth, A fifth inference that I gather from this text is, that the end that God will make with men will be according as they come or come not to God by Christ.",They that come to God by Christ have taken shelter and have hid themselves; but they that come not to God by Christ lay themselves open to the windy storm and tempest that will be in that day.,"And the wind then will be high, and the tempest strong, that will blow upon them that shall be found in themselves; 'Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.","He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.'","(Psa 50:3,4) And now, what will be found in that day to be the portion of them that in this day do not come to God by Christ?","None knows but God, with whom the reward of unbelievers is.","But writing and preaching is in vain as to such; let men say what they will, what they can, to persuade to come, to dissuade from neglecting to come, they are resolved not to stir.","They will try if God will be so faithful to himself and to his Word, as to dare to condemn them to hell fire that have refused to hear and comply with the voice of him that speaketh from heaven.",But this is but a desperate venture.,Several things declare that He is determined to be at a point in this matter-- 1.,The gallows are built--hell is prepared for the wicked.,2.,"There are those already in chains, and stand bound over to the judgment of that day, that are, as to creation, higher and greater than men, to wit, the angels that sinned.","(2 Peter 2:4) Let sinners, then, look to themselves.",3.,"The Judge is prepared and appointed, and it hath fallen out to be HE that thou hast refused to come to God by; and that predicts no good to thee; for then will he say of all such, 'Those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.'","(Luke 19:27) But what a surprise will it be to them that now have come to God by Christ to see themselves in heaven indeed, saved indeed, and possessed of everlasting life indeed.",For alas!,what is faith to possession?,"Faith that is mixed with many fears, that is opposed with many assaults, and that seems sometimes to be quite extinguished; I say, what is that to a seeing of myself in heaven?","Hence it is said, that he shall then come to be admired in them that now believe, because they did here believe the testimony; then they shall admire that it was their lot to believe when they were in the world.","(2 Thess 1:10) They shall also admire to think, to see, and behold, what believing has brought them to, while the rest, for refusing to come to God by Christ, drink their tears mixed with burning brimstone.","Repentance will not be found in heaven among them that come to God by Christ; no, hell is the place of untimely repentance; it is there where the tears will be mixed with gnashing of teeth, while they consider how mad, and worse, they were in not coming to God by Jesus Christ.","Then will their hearts and mouths be full of, 'Lord, Lord, open unto us.'","But the answer will be, Ye shut me out of doors; 'I was a stranger, and ye took me not in'; besides, you refused to come to my Father by me, wherefore now you must go from my Father by me.","(Matt 25) They that will not be saved by Christ, must be damned by Christ; no man can escape one of the two.","Refuse the first they may, but shun the second they cannot.","And now they that would not come unto God by Christ will have leisure and time enough, if I may call it time, to consider what they have done in refusing to come to God by Christ.","Now they will meditate warmly on this thing, now their thoughts will be burning hot about it, and it is too late, will be, in each thought, such a sting, that, like a bow of steel, it will continually strike him through.","Now they will bless those whom formerly they have despised, and commend those they once contemned.","Now would the rich man willingly change places with poor Lazarus, though he preferred his own condition before his in the world.",The day of judgment will bring the worst to rights in their opinions; they will not be capable of misapprehending any more.,"They will never after that day put bitter for sweet, or darkness for light, or evil for good any more.",Their madness will now be gone.,"Hell will be the unbeliever's bedlam house, and there God will tame them as to all those bedlam tricks and pranks which they played in this world, but not at all to their profit nor advantage; the gulf that God has placed and fixed betwixt heaven and hell will spoil all as to that.",(Luke 16:23-26) But what a joy will it be to the truly godly to think now that they are come to God by Christ!,"It was their mercy to begin to come, it was their happiness that they continued coming; but it is their glory that they are come, that they are come to God by Christ.",To God!,"why, he is all!","all that is good, essentially good, and eternally good.",To God!,the infinite ocean of good.,"To God, in friendly-wise, by the means of reconciliation; for the other now will be come to him to receive his anger, because they come not to him by Jesus Christ.",Oh!,that I could imagine; oh!,"that I could think, that I might write more effectually to thee of the happy estate of them that come to God by Christ.","But thus have I passed through the three former things, namely, 1.",That of the intercession of Christ.,2.,That of the benefit of intercession.,3.,That of the persons that are interested in this intercession.,[IV.,EVERY SINCERE COMER CERTAIN OF SALVATION.],"Wherefore now I come to the fourth and last head, and that is, TO SHOW YOU THE CERTAINTY OF THEIR REAPING THE BENEFIT OF HIS INTERCESSION.","'Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.'",[Christ ever living is the safety of comers.],The certainty of their reaping the benefit of being saved that come unto God by Christ is thus expressed: 'Seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.',"The intercession of Christ, and the lastingness of it, is a sure token of the salvation of them that come unto God by him.","Of his intercession, what it is, and for whom, we have spoken already; of the success and prevalency of it, we have also spoken before; but the reason of its successfulness of that we are to speak now.","And that reason, as the apostle suggesteth, lies in the continuance of it, 'Seeing he ever liveth to make intercession.'","The apostle also makes very much of the continuation of the priesthood of Christ in other places of this epistle: he abides a priest continually, 'Thou art a priest for ever.'",He 'hath an unchangeable priesthood.',"(Heb 7:3,17,21,24) And here he 'ever liveth to make intercession.'","Now, by the text is showed the reason why he so continually harpeth upon the durableness of it, namely, for that by the unchangeableness of this priesthood we are saved; nay, saved demonstratively, apparently; it is evident we are.","'He is also able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.'","For, First, The durableness of his intercession proves that the covenant in which those who come to God by him are concerned and wrapt up is not shaken, broken, or made invalid by all their weaknesses and infirmities.","Christ is a priest according to covenant, and in all his acts of mediation he has regard to that covenant; so long as that covenant abides in its strength, so long Christ's intercession is of worth.","Hence, when God cast the old high priest out of doors, he renders this reason for his so doing: 'Because they continued not in my covenant'; that is, neither priests nor people.","Therefore were they cast out of the priesthood, and the people pulled down as to a church state.","(Heb 7:6-9) Now, the covenant by which Christ acteth, as a priest, so far as we are concerned therein, he also himself acteth our part, being, indeed, the Head and Mediator of the body; wherefore, God doth not count that the covenant is broken, though we sin, if Christ Jesus our Lord is found to do by it what by law is required of us.","Therefore he saith, 'If his children break my law, and keep not my commandments, I will visit their sins with a rod,' &c. But their sins shall not shake my covenant with my Beloved, nor cause that I for ever should reject them.","'My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.","His seed will I make to endure for ever, his seed shall endure for ever.'","(Psa 89:30-36) Hence, it is clear that the covenant stands good to us as long as Christ stands good to God, or before his face; for he is not only our Mediator by covenant, but he himself is our conditions to God-ward; therefore he is said to be 'a covenant of the people,' or that which the holy God, by law, required of us.","(Isa 42:6) Hence, again, he is said to be our justice or righteousness; to wit, which answereth to what is required of us by the law.","He is made unto us of God so, and in our room and in our stead presenteth himself to God.","So, then, if any ask me by what Christ's priesthood is continued, I answer, by covenant; for that the covenant by which he is made priest abideth of full force.","If any ask whether the church is concerned in that covenant, I answer, yea; yet so as that all points and parts thereof, that concern life and death everlasting, is laid upon his shoulders, and he alone is the doer of it.","He is the Lord our righteousness, and he is the Saviour of the body, so that my sins break not the covenant; but them15 notwithstanding, God's covenant stands fast with him, with him for evermore.","And good reason, if no fault can be found with Christ, who is the person that did strike hands with his Father upon our account and for us; to wit, to do what was meet should be found upon us when we came to appear before God by him.","And that God himself doth so understand this matter is evident; because he also, by his own act, giveth and imputeth to us that good that we never did, that righteousness which we never wrought out; yea, and for the sake of that transmitteth our sins unto Christ, as to one that had not only well satisfied for them, but could carry them so far, both from us and from God, that they should never again come to be charged on the committers, to death and damnation.","(Rom 4:1-5) The Scriptures are so plentiful for this, that he must be a Turk, or a Jew, or an atheist that denies it.","Besides, God's commanding that men should believe in his Son unto righteousness well enough proveth this thing, and the reason of this command doth prove it with an over and above; to wit, 'For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.'","(2 Cor 5:19-21) Hence comes out that proclamation from God, at the rising again of Christ from the dead: 'Be it known unto you, therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins; and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.'","(Acts 13:38,39) If this be so, as indeed it is, then here lieth a great deal of this conclusion, 'he ever liveth to make intercession,' and of the demonstration of the certain salvation of him that cometh to God by him, 'seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.'","For if Christ Jesus is a priest by covenant, and so abides as the covenant abides, and if, since the covenant is everlasting, his priesthood is unchangeable, then the man that cometh to God by him must needs be certainly saved; for if the covenant, the covenant of salvation, is not broken, none can show a reason why he that comes to Christ should be damned, or why the priesthood of Jesus Christ should cease.","Hence, after the apostle had spoken of the excellency of his person and priesthood, he then shows that the benefit of the covenant of God remaineth with us, namely, that grace should be communicated unto us for his priesthood's sake, and that our sins and iniquities God would remember no more.","(Heb 8:10-12; 10:16-22) Now, as I also have already hinted, if this covenant, of which the Lord Jesus is Mediator and High Priest, has in the bowels of it, not only grace and remission of sins, but a promise that we shall be partakers thereof, through the blood of his priesthood, for so it comes to us; then, why should not we have boldness, not only to come to God by him, but to enter also 'into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by that new and living way,' &c. Second, But, further, this priesthood, as to the unchangeableness of it, is confirmed unto him 'with an oath, by him that said unto him, the Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever.'","This oath seems to me to be for the confirmation of the covenant, as it is worded before by Paul to the Galatians, (Gal 3:15-17), when he speaks of it with respect to that establishment that it also had on Christ's part by the sacrifice which he offered to God for us; yea, he then speaks of the mutual confirmation of it both by the Father and the Son.","Now, I say, since, by this covenant he stands and abides a Priest, and since 'the Lord sware, and will not repent, saying, Thou art a priest for ever,' we are still further confirmed in the certain salvation of him that cometh to God by Christ.","The Lord, by swearing, confirmeth to Christ, and so to us in him, the immutability of his counsel, (Heb 6:16-18), and that he is utterly unchangeable in his resolutions 'to save them to the uttermost that come to God by Christ.'","And this also shows that this covenant, and so the promise of remission of sins, is steadfast and unmovable.","And it is worth your noting the manner and nature of this oath, 'The Lord sware, and will not repent.'","It is as much as to say, What I have now sworn I bind me for ever to stand to, or, I determine never to revoke; and that is, 'That thou art a priest for ever.'","Now, as was said before, since his priesthood stands by covenant, and this covenant of his priesthood is confirmed by this oath, it cannot be but that he that comes by him to God must be accepted of him; for should such a one be rejected, it must be either for the greatness of his sins, or for want of merit in the sacrifice he presented and urged, as to the merit of it, before the mercy-seat.","But let the reason specified be what it will, the consequence falls harder upon the sacrifice of Christ than it can do anywhere else, and so also upon the covenant, and at last upon God himself, who has sworn, and will not repent, that he is a Priest for ever.","I thus discourse, to show you what dangerous conclusions follow from a conceit that some that come to God by Christ shall not be saved, though 'he ever liveth to make intercession for them.'","And this I have further to say, that the Lord's swearing, since the manner of the oath is such as it is, and that it also tended to establish to Christ his priesthood to be unchangeable, it declareth that, as to the excellency of his sacrifice, he is eternally satisfied in the goodness and merit of it; and that he will never deny him anything that he shall ask for at his hands for his sufferings' sake.","For this oath doth not only show God's firm resolution to keep his part of the covenant, in giving to Christ that which was covenanted for by him, but it declareth that, in the judgment of God, Christ's blood is able to save any sinner, and that he will never put stop nor check to his intercession, how great soever the sinners be that at any time he shall intercede for; so that the demonstration is clearer and clearer, 'He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.'","Third, This unchangeableness of the priesthood of Christ dependeth also upon his own life: 'This man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.'","(Heb 7:24) Now although, perhaps, at first much may not appear in this text, yet the words that we are upon take their ground from them.","'This man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood: wherefore he is able also'--that is, by his unchangeable priesthood--'to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.'","The life of Christ, then, is a ground of the lastingness of his priesthood, and so a ground of the salvation of them that come unto God by him: 'We shall be saved by his life.'","(Rom 5:10) Wherefore, in another place, this his life is spoken of with great emphasis--the power of an endless life.","'He is made [a priest], not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.'","(Heb 7:16) An endless life is, then, a powerful thing; and indeed two things are very considerable in it--1.","That it is above death, and so above him that hath the power of death, the devil.",2.,"In that it capacitates him to be the last in his own cause, and so to have the casting voice.",1.,"We will speak to the first, and for the better setting of it forth we will show what life it is of which the apostle here speaks; and then how, as to life, it comes to be so advantageous, both with respect to his office of priesthood and us.",What life is it that is thus the ground of his priesthood?,"It is a life taken, his own life rescued from the power of the grave; a life that we had forfeited, he being our surety; and a life that he recovered again, he being the Captain of our salvation: I lay down my life that I may take it again: 'this commandment have I received of my Father.'","(John 10:18) It is a life, then, that was once laid down as the price of man's redemption, and a life won, gained, taken, or recovered again, as the token or true effect of the completing, by so dying, that redemption; wherefore it is said again, 'In that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.'","(Rom 6:10) He liveth as having pleased God by dying for our sins, as having merited his life by dying for our sins.","Now if this life of his is a life merited and won by virtue of the death that he died, as Acts 2:24 doth clearly manifest; and if this life is the ground of the unchangeableness of this part of his priesthood, as we see it is, then it follows that this second part of his priesthood, which is called here intercession, is grounded upon the demonstrations of the virtue of his sacrifice, which is his life taken to live again; so, then, he holds this part of his priesthood, not by virtue of a carnal commandment, but by the power of an endless life; but by the power of a life rescued from death, and eternally exalted above all that any ways would yet assault it; for 'Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.'","(Rom 6:9) Hence Christ brings in his life, the life that he won to himself by his death, to comfort John withal when he fainted under the view of that overcoming glory that he saw upon Christ in is visions of him at Patmos: 'And he laid his right hand upon me,' said he, 'saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth and was dead, and, behold, I am alive for evermore.",Amen.',"(Rev 1:17,18) Why should Christ bring in his life to comfort John, if it was not a life advantageous to him?","But the advantageousness of it doth lie not merely in the being of life, but in that it was a life laid down for his sins, and a life taken up again for his justification; a life lost to ransom him, and a life won to save him; as also the text affirmeth, saying, 'He is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.'","Again; it is yet more manifest that Christ receiving of his life again was the death and destruction of the enemy of his people; and to manifest that it was so, therefore he adds (after he had said, 'And, behold, I am alive for evermore.","Amen'), 'And I have the keys of hell and of death.'","I have the power over them; I have them under me; I tread them down by being a victor, a conqueror, and one that has got the dominion of life (for he now is the Prince of life), one that lives for evermore.",Amen.,"Hence it is said again, He 'hath abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.'","(2 Tim 1:10) He hath abolished death by his death (by death he destroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the devil), and brought life (a very emphatical expression); and brought it from whence?","From God, who raised him from the dead; and brought it to light, to our view and sight, by the word of the truth of the gospel.","So, then, the life that he now hath is a life once laid down as the price of our redemption; a life obtained and taken to him again as the effect of the merit that was in the laying down thereof; a life by the virtue of which death, and sin, and the curse is overcome; and so a life that is above them for ever.","This is the life that he liveth--to wit, this meriting, purchasing, victorious life--and that he improveth while he ever so lives to make intercession for us.","This life, then, is a continual plea and argument with God for them that come to him by Christ, should he make no other intercession, but only show to God that he liveth; because his thus living saith, that he has satisfied for the sins of them that come unto God by him.","It testifies, moreover, that those--to wit, death, the grave, and hell--are overcome by him for them; because indeed he liveth, and hath their keys.","But now, add to life, to a life meritorious, intercession, or an urging of this meritorious life by way of prayer for his, and against all those that seek to destroy them, since they themselves also have been already overcome by his death, and what an encouraging consideration is here for all them that come to God by him, to hope for life eternal.","But, 2.","Let us speak a word to the second head--namely, for that his living for ever capacitates him to be the last in his own cause, and to have the casting voice, and that is an advantage next to what is chiefest.",His cause; what is his cause?,"but that the death that he died when he was in the world was and is of merit sufficient to secure all those from hell, or, as the text has it, to save them that come unto God by him, to save them to the uttermost.","Now, if this cause be faulty, why doth he live?","yea, he liveth by the power of God, by the power of God towards us; or with a respect to our welfare, for he liveth to make intercession, intercession against Satan our accuser, for us.","(2 Cor 13:4) Besides, he liveth before God, and to God, and that after he had given his life a ransom for us.","What can follow more clearly from this, but that amends were made by him for those souls for whose sins he suffered upon the tree?","Wherefore, since his Father has given him his life and favour, and that after he died for our sins, it cannot be thought but that the life he now liveth, is a life that he received as the effect of the merit of his passion for us.","God is just, and yet Christ liveth, and yet Christ liveth in heaven!","God is just, and yet Christ our passover liveth there, do what our foes can to the contrary!","And this note, by the way, that though the design of Satan against us, in his labouring continually to accuse us to God, and to prevail against our salvation, seems to terminate here, yet indeed it is also laid against the very life of Christ, and that his priesthood might be utterly overthrown; and, in conclusion, that God also might be found unjust in receiving of such whose sins have not been satisfied for, and so whose souls are yet under the power of the devil.","For he that objects against him for whom Christ intercedes, objects against Christ and his merits; and he that objects against Christ's intercession, objects against God, who has made him a priest for ever.","Behold you, therefore, how the cause of God, of Christ, and of the souls that come to God by him are interwoven; they are all wrapt up in one bottom.","Mischief one, and you mischief all; overthrow that soul, and you overthrow his intercessor; and overthrow him, and you overthrow even him that made him a priest for ever.",For the text is without restriction: 'He is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him.',"He saith not, now and then one, or sinners of an inferior rank in sin, but them that come to God by him, how great soever their transgressions are, as is clear in that it addeth this clause, 'to the uttermost.'",'He is able to save them to the uttermost.',"But if he were not, why did the King send, yea, come and loose him, and let him go free; yea, admit him into his presence; yea, make him Lord over all his people, and deliver all things into his hand?","But he liveth, he ever liveth, and is admitted to make intercession, yea, is ordained of God so to do; therefore he is 'able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him.'","This, therefore, that he liveth, seeing he liveth to God and his judgment, and in justice is made so to do, it is chiefly with reference to his life as Mediator for their sakes for whom he makes intercession.",He liveth to make intercession.,"And in that it is said he liveth ever, what is it but that he must live, and outlive all his enemies; for he must live, yea, reign, till all his enemies are put under his feet.","(1 Cor 15:25) Yea, his very intercessions must live till they are all dead and gone.","For the devil and sin must not live for ever, not for ever to accuse.","Time is coming when due course of law will have an end, and all cavillers will be cast over the bar.","But then and after that, Christ our high priest shall live, and so shall his intercessions; yea, and also all them for whom he makes intercession, seeing they come unto God by him.","Now if he lives, and outlives all, and if his intercession has the casting voice, since also he pleadeth in his prayers a sufficient merit before a just God, against a lying, malicious, clamorous, and envious adversary, he must needs carry the cause, the cause for himself and his people, to the glory of God and their salvation.","So, then, his life and intercession must prevail, there can be no withstanding of it.","Is not this, then, a demonstration clear as the sun, that they that come to God by him shall be saved, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them?","Fourth, The duration of Christ's intercession, as it is grounded upon a covenant betwixt God and him, upon an oath also, and upon his life, so it is grounded upon the validity of his merits.","This has been promiscuously touched before, but since it is an essential to the lastingness of his intercession, it will be to the purpose to lay it down by itself.","Intercession, then, I mean Christ's intercession, is, that those for whom he died with full intention to save them, might be brought into that inheritance which he hath purchased for them.","Now, then, his intercession must, as to length and breadth, reach no further than his merits, for he may not pray for those for whom he died not.","Indeed, if we take in the utmost extent of his death, then we must beware, for his death is sufficient to save the whole world.",But his intercessions are kept within a narrower compass.,"The altar of burnt-offerings was a great deal bigger than the altar of incense, which was a figure of Christ's intercession.","(Exo 27:1, 30:1, Rev 8:3) But this, I say, his intercession is for those for whom he died with full intention to save them; wherefore it must be grounded upon the validity of his sufferings.","And, indeed, his intercession is nothing else, that I know of, but a presenting of what he did in the world for us unto God, and pressing the value of it for our salvation.","The blood of sprinkling is that which speaketh meritoriously, (Heb 12:24); it is by the value of that that God measureth out and giveth unto us grace and life eternal; wherefore Christ's intercessions also must be ordered and governed by merit; 'By his own blood he entered into the holy place, having [before by it] obtained eternal redemption for us,' for our souls.","(Heb 9:12) Now, if by blood he entered in thither, by blood he must also make intercession there.","His blood made way for his entrance thither, his blood must make way for our entrance thither.","Though here, again, we must beware; for his blood did make way for him as Priest to intercede; his blood makes way for us, as for those redeemed by it, that we might be saved.","This, then, shows sufficiently the worth of the blood of Christ, even his ever living to make intercession for us; for the merit of his blood lasts all the while that he doth, and for all them for whom he ever liveth to make intercession.","Oh, precious blood!","oh, lasting merit!","Blood must be pleaded in Christ's intercession, because of justice, and to stop the mouth of the enemy, and also to encourage us to come to God by him.","Justice, since that is of the essence of God, must concur in the salvation of the sinner; but how can that be, since it is said at first, 'In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die,' unless a plenary16 satisfaction be made for sin to the pleasing of the mighty God.",The enemy also would else never let go his objecting against our salvation.,"But now God has declared that our salvation is grounded on justice, because merited by blood.","And though God needed not to have given his Son to die for us that he might save us, and stop the mouth of the devil in so doing, yet this way of salvation has done both, and so it is declared, we are 'justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past--to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.'","(Rom 3:24,25) So, then, here is also a ground of intercession, even the blood shed for us before.","And that you may see it yet more for your comfort, God did, at Christ's resurrection, to show what a price he set upon his blood, bid him ask of him the heathen, and he would give him the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession.","(Psa 2:8) His blood, then, has value enough in it to ground intercession upon; yea, there is more worth in it than Christ will plead or improve for men by way of intercession.","I do not at all doubt but that there is virtue enough in the blood of Christ, would God Almighty so apply it, to save the souls of the whole world.","But it is the blood of Christ, his own blood; and he may do what he will with his own.","It is also the blood of God, and he also may restrain its merits, or apply it as he sees good.","But the coming soul, he shall find and feel the virtue thereof, even the soul that comes to God by Christ; for he is the man concerned in its worth, and he ever liveth to make intercession for him.","Now, seeing the intercession of Christ is grounded upon a covenant, an oath, a life, and also upon the validity of his merits, it must of necessity be prevalent, and so drive down all opposition before it.","This, therefore, is the last part of the text, and that which demonstrateth that he that comes to God by Christ shall be saved, seeing 'he ever liveth to make intercession for him.'",I have now done what I intend upon this subject when I have drawn a few inferences from this also.,[Inferences from the certainty of benefit from Christ's Intercession.],"First, then, hence I infer that the souls saved by Christ are in themselves in a most deplorable condition.","Oh, what ado, as I may say, is here before one sinner can be eternally saved!",Christ must die; but that is not all; the Spirit of grace must be given to us; but that is not all;--but Christ must also ever live to make intercession for us.,"And as he doth this for all, so he doth it for each one.","He interceded for me, before I was born, that I might in time, at the set time, come into being.","After that, he also made intercession for me, that I might be kept from hell in the time of my unregenerate state, until the time of my call and conversion.","Yet again, he then intercedes that the work now begun in my soul may be perfected, not only to the day of my dissolution, but unto the day of Christ; that is, until he comes to judgment.","(Phil 1:6) So that, as he began to save me before I had being, so he will go on to save me when I am dead and gone, and will never leave off to save me until he has set me before his face for ever.","But, I say, what a deplorable condition has our sin put us into, that there must be all this ado to save us.","Oh, how hardly is sin got out of the soul when once it is in!","Blood takes away the guilt; inherent grace weakens the filth; but the grave is the place, at the mouth of which, sin, as to the being of sin, and the saved, must have a perfect and final parting.","(Isa 38:10) Not that the grave of itself is of a sin-purging quality, but God will follow Satan home to his own door; for the grave is the door or gate of hell, and will there, where the devil thought to have swallowed us up, even there by the power of his mercy make us, at our coming thence, shine like the sun, and look like angels.","Christ, all this while, ever liveth to make intercession for us.","Second, Hence, also, I infer that as Satan thought he struck home at first, when he polluted our nature, and brought our souls to death, so he is marvellous loath to lose us, and to suffer his lawful captives now to escape his hands.","He is full of fire against us, full of the fire of malice, as is manifest-- 1.","Not only by his first attempt upon our first parents, but behold, when the Deliverer came into the world, how he roared.",He sought his death while he was an infant; he hated him in his cradle; he persecuted him while he was but a bud and blossom.,"(Matt 2) When he was come to riper years, and began to manifest his glory, yet, lest the world should be taken with him, how politicly did this old serpent, called the Devil and Satan, work?","He possessed people that he had a devil, and was mad, and a deceiver; that he wrought his miracles by magic art and by the devil; that the prophets spake nothing of him, and that he sought to overthrow the government which was God's ordinance.","And, not being contented with all this, he pursued him to the death, and could never rest until he had spilt his blood upon the ground like water.","Yea, so insatiable was his malice, that he set the soldiers to forge lies about him to the denial of his resurrection, and so managed that matter that what they said has become a stumblingblock to the Jews to this very day.","(John 10:20, 7:12, Matt 9:34, John 7:52, Luke 23:2, Matt 28:11-15) 2.","When he was ascended to God, and so was out of his reach, yet how busily went he about to make war with his people.","(Rev 12) Yea, what horrors and terrors, what troubles and temptations, has God's church met with from that day till now!",Nor is he content with persecutions and general troubles; but oh!,"how doth he haunt the spirits of the Christians with blasphemies and troubles, with darkness and frightful fears; sometimes to their distraction, and often to the filling the church with outcries.",3.,"Yet his malice is in the pursuit, and now his boldness will try what it can do with God, either to tempt him to reject his Son's mediation, or to reject them that come to God by him for mercy.",And this is one cause among many why 'he ever liveth to make intercession for them that come to God by him.',4.,"And if he cannot overthrow, if he knows he cannot overthrow them, yet he cannot forbear but vex and perplex them, even as he did their Lord, from the day of their conversion to the day of their ascension to glory.","Third, Hence I infer that the love of Christ to his, is an unwearied love, and it must needs be so; an undaunted love, and it must needs be so.","Who but Jesus Christ would have undertaken such a task as the salvation of the sinner is, if Jesus Christ had passed us by?","It is true which is written of him, 'He shall not fail, nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth,' &c. If he had not set his 'face like a flint,' the greatness of this work would surely have daunted his mind.","(Isa 42:1, 50:6-7) For do but consider what sin is from which they must be saved; do but consider what the devil and the curse is from which they must be saved; and it will easily be concluded by you that it is he that full rightly deserveth to have his name called Wonderful, and his love such as verily passeth knowledge.","Consider, again, by what means these souls are saved, even with the loss of his life, and, together with it, the loss of the light of his Father's face.","I pass by here and forbear to speak of the matchless contradiction of sinners which he endured against himself, which could not but be a great grief, or, as himself doth word it, a breaking of heart unto him; but all this did not, could not, hinder.","Join to all this, his everlasting intercession for us, and the effectual management thereof with God for us; and, withal, the infinite number of times that we by sin provoke him to spue us out of his mouth, instead of interceding for us, and the many times also that his intercession is repeated by the repeating of our faults, and this love still passes knowledge, and is by us to be wondered at.","What did, or what doth, the Lord Jesus see in us to be at all this care, and pains, and cost to save us?",What will he get of us by the bargain but a small pittance of thanks and love?,"for so it is, and ever will be, when compared with his matchless and unspeakable love and kindness towards us.","Oh, how unworthy are we of this love!",How little do we think of it!,"But, most of all, the angels may be astonished to see how little we are affected with that of which we pretend to know.",But neither can this prevail with him to put us out of the scroll in which all the names of them are written for whom he doth make intercession to God.,"Let us cry, Grace, grace unto it.","Fourth, Hence again I infer that they shall be saved that come to God by Christ, when the devil and sin have done what they can to hinder it.","This is clear, for that the strife is now, who shall be lord of all, whether Satan, the prince of this world, or Christ Jesus, the Son of God; or which can lay the best claim to God's elect, he that produceth their sins against them, or he that laid down his heart's blood a price of redemption for them.","Who, then, shall condemn when Christ has died, and doth also make intercession?","Stand still, angels, and behold how the Father divideth his Son 'a portion with the great'; and how he divideth 'the spoil with the strong: because he hath poured out his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors, and bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.'","(Isa 53:12) The grace of God and blood of Christ will, before the end of the world, make brave work among the sons of men!","They shall come to a wonderment to God by Christ, and be saved by a wonderment for Christ's sake--'Behold these shall come from far: and lo, these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Sinim.'","(Isa 49:12) Behold, these, and these, and these shall come, and lo, these, and these, and these from the land of Sinim!","This is to denote the abundance that shall come in to God by Christ towards the latter end of the world--namely, when Antichrist is gone to bed in the sides of the pit's mouth; then shall nations come in and be saved, and shall walk in the light of the Lord.17 But, I say, what encouragement would there be for sinners thus to do if that the Lord Jesus by his intercession were not able to save 'even to the uttermost' them that come unto God by him.","Fifth, hence again I infer that here is ground for confidence to them that come to God by Christ.","Confidence to the end becomes us who have such a High Priest, such an Intercessor as Jesus Christ; who would dishonour such a Jesus by doubting that, that all the devils in hell cannot discourage by all their wiles?","He is a tried stone, he is a sure foundation; a man may confidently venture his soul in his hand, and not fear but he will bring him safe home.","Ability, love to the person, and faithfulness to trust committed to him, will do all; and all these are with infinite fullness in him.","He has been a Saviour these four thousand years already--two thousand before the law, two thousand in the time of the law--besides the sixteen hundred years he has in his flesh continued to make intercession for them that come unto God by him.","Yet the day is to come, yea, will never come, that he can be charged with any fault, or neglect of the salvation of any of them that at any time have come unto God by him.","What ground, then, is here for confidence that Christ will make a good end with me, since I come unto God by him, and since he ever liveth to make intercession for me.","Let me, then, honour him, I say, by setting on his head the crown of his undertakings for me, by the believing that he is able to save me 'even to the uttermost, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for me.'","Sixth, Hence also I infer that Christ ought to bear and wear the glory of our salvation for ever.","He has done it, he has wrought it out.","'Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength.'","Do not sacrifice to your own inventions, do not give glory to the work of your own hands.","Your reformations, your works, your good deeds, and all the glory of your doing, cast them at the feet of this High Priest, and confess that glory belongs unto him--'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.'","(Rev 5:12) 'And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his Father's house, and offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons.'",(Isa 22:24) Oh!,"the work of our redemption by Christ is such as wanteth not provocation to us to bless, and praise, and glorify Jesus Christ.","Saints, set to the work and glorify him in your body and in your souls; him who has bought us with a price, and glorify God and the Father by him.",(1 Cor 6:20) THE USE.,"I come now to make some use of this discourse; and, USE FIRST, Let me exhort you to the study of this, as of other the truths of our Lord Jesus Christ.","The priestly office of Christ is the first and great thing that is presented to us in the gospel--namely, how that he died for our sins, and gave himself to the cross, that the blessing of Abraham might come upon us through him.","(1 Cor 15:1-6, Gal 3:13-16) But now because this priestly office of his is divided into two parts, and because one of them--to wit, this of his intercession--is to be accomplished for us within the veil, therefore, as we say among men, out of sight out of mind, he is too much as to this forgotten by us.","We satisfy ourselves with the slaying of the sacrifice; we look not enough after our Aaron as he goes into the holiest, there to sprinkle the mercy-seat with blood upon our account.","God forbid that the least syllable of what I say should be intended by me, or construed by others, as if I sought to diminish the price paid by Christ for our redemption in this world.","But since his dying is his laying down his price, and his intercession the urging and managing the worthiness of it in the presence of God against Satan, there is glory to be found therein, and we should look after him into the holy place.","The second part of the work of the high priests under the law, had great glory and sanctity put upon it; forasmuch as the holy garments were provided for him to officiate in within the veil, also it as there that the altar stood on which he offered incense; also there was the mercy-seat and the cherubims of glory, which were figures of the angels, that love to be continually looking and prying into the management of this second part of the priesthood of Christ in the presence of God; for although themselves are not the persons so immediately concerned therein as we, yet the management of it, I say, is with so much grace, and glory, and wisdom, and effectualness, that it is a heaven to the angels to see it.",Oh!,"to enjoy the odorous scent, and sweet memorial, the heart-refreshing perfumes, that ascend continually from the mercy-seat to the 'above' where God is; and also to behold how effectual it is to the end for which it is designed, is glorious; and he that is not somewhat let into this by the grace of God, there is a great thing lacking to his faith, and he misseth of many a sweet bit that he might otherwise enjoy.","Wherefore, I say, be exhorted to the study of this part of Christ's work in the managing of our salvation for us.","And the ceremonies of the law may be a great help to you as to this, for though they be out of use now as to practice, yet the signification of them is rich, and that from which many gospellers18 have got much.","Wherefore I advise that you read the five books of Moses often; yea, read, and read again, and do not despair of help to understand something of the will and mind of God therein, though you think they are fast locked up from you.","Neither trouble your heads though you have not commentaries and expositions; pray and read, and read and pray; for a little from God is better than a great deal from men.","Also, what is from men is uncertain, and is often lost and tumbled over and over by men; but what is from God is fixed as a nail in a sure place.","I know there are [peculiar] times of temptation, but I speak now as to the common course of Christianity.","There is nothing that so abides with us as what we receive from God; and the reason why Christians at this day are at such a loss as to some things is, because they are content with what come from men's mouths, without searching and kneeling before God, to know of him the truth of things.","Things that we receive at God's hand come to us as things from the minting house, though old in themselves, yet new to us.",Old truths are always new to us if they come to us with the smell of heaven upon them.,"I speak not this because I would have people despise their ministers, but to show that there is nowadays so much idleness among professors as hinders them from a diligent search after things, and makes them take up short of that that is sealed by the Spirit of testimony to the conscience.","Witness the great decays at this day among us, and that strange revolting from truth once professed by us.","USE SECOND, As I would press you to an earnest study and search after this great truth, so I would press you to a diligent improvement of it to yourselves and to others.",To know truth for knowledge sake is short of a gracious disposition of soul; and to communicate truth out of a desire of praise and vain-glory for so doing is also a swerving from godly simplicity; but to improve what I know for the good of myself and others is true Christianity indeed.,"Now truths received may be improved with respect to myself and others, and that several ways-- 1.","To myself, when I search after the power that belongs to those notions that I have received of truth.",There belongs to every true notion of truth a power; the notion is the shell--the power is the kernel and life.,"Without this last, truth doth me no good, nor those to whom I communicate it.","Hence Paul said to the Corinthians, 'When I come to you again, I will know not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.","For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.'","(1 Cor 4:19,20) Search, then, after the power of what thou knowest, for it is the power that will do thee good.","Now this will not be got but by earnest prayer, and much attending upon God; also there must not be admitted by thee that thy heart be stuffed with cumbering cares of this world, for they are of a choking nature.","Take heed of slighting that little that thou hast; a good improvement of little is the way to make that little thrive, and the way to obtain additions thereto: 'He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.'",(Luke 16:10) 2.,"Improve them to others, and that, (1.)","By labouring to instill them upon their hearts by good and wholesome words, presenting all to them with the authority of the Scriptures.",(2.),"Labour to enforce those instillings on them by showing them by thy life the peace, the glorious effects that they have upon thy soul.","Lastly, Let this doctrine give thee boldness to come to God.",Shall Jesus Christ be interceding in heaven?,"Oh, then, be thou a praying man on earth; yea, take courage to pray.","Think thus with thyself--I go to God, to God, before whose throne the Lord Jesus is ready to hand my petitions to him; yea, 'he ever lives to make intercession for me.'","This is a great encouragement to come to God by prayers and supplications for ourselves, and by intercessions for our families, our neighbours, and enemies.",Farewell.,"FOOTNOTES: 1: Coming unto God by Christ, essentially involves in it walking in conformity to his image;

all the human craft employed in keeping the soul from a simple and entire reliance upon Christ for salvation.","This little work soon became most deservedly popular, passing through four large editions during the last seven years of the author's life.","It is an enlightened display of the dealings of the Father in giving sinners to Christ; the Son in saving them by his atonement, mediation, and intercession; and the Holy Spirit in sanctifying and fitting them for glory.","Here is no Calvinism, Lutheranism, or Arminianism; no Episcopacy, Presbytery, or Independency;

by which means the ship was hindered in her passage.","Now, about the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came walking upon the sea, and overtook them; at the sight of whom they were afraid.","Note, When providences are black and terrible to God's people, the Lord Jesus shows himself to them in wonderful manner; the which sometimes they can as little bear, as they can the things that were before terrible to them.","They were afraid of the wind and the water; they were also afraid of their Lord and Saviour, when he appeared to them in that state.","But he said, ""Be not afraid, it is I.""","Note, That the end of the appearing of the Lord Jesus unto his people, though the manner of his appearing be never so terrible, is to allay their fears and perplexities.","Then they received him into the ship, and immediately the ship was at land whither it went.","Note, When Christ is absent from his people, they go on but slowly, and with great difficulty; but when he joineth himself unto them, oh!",how fast they steer their course!,how soon are they at their journey's end!,"1 The people now among whom he last preached, when they saw that both Jesus was gone and his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.","And when they had found him, they wonderingly asked him, ""Rabbi, when camest thou hither?""","but the Lord Jesus, slighting their compliment, answered, ""Verily, verily, ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.""","Note, A people may follow Christ far for base ends, as these went after him beyond sea for loaves.","A man's belly will carry him a great way in religion; yea, a man's belly will make him venture far for Christ.","Note again, They are not feigning compliments, but gracious intentions, that crown the work in the eye of Christ; or thus, it is not the toil and business of professors, 2 but their love to him, that makes him approve of them.","Note again, When men shall look for friendly entertainment at Christ's hand, if their hearts be rotten, even then will they meet with a check and rebuke.","""Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.""","Yet observe again, He doth not refuse to give, even to these, good counsel: he bids them labour for the meat that endureth to eternal life.",Oh!,"how willingly would Jesus Christ have even those professors that come to him with pretences only, come to him sincerely, that they may be saved.","The text, you will find, is, after much more discourse with and about this people, and it is uttered by the Lord Jesus as the conclusion of the whole, and intimateth that, since they were professors in pretence only, and therefore such as his soul could not delight in, as such, that he would content himself with a remnant that his Father had bestowed upon him.","As who should say, I am not like to be honoured in your salvation; but the Father hath bestowed upon me a people, and they shall come to me in truth, and in them will I be satisfied.","The text, therefore, may be called Christ's repose; in the fulfilling whereof he resteth himself content, after much labour and many sermons spent, as it were, in vain.","As he saith by the prophet, ""I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain"" (Isa 49:4).","But as there he saith, ""My judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God;"" so in the text he saith, ""All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""","By these words, therefore, the Lord Jesus comforteth himself under the consideration of the dissimulation of some of his followers.","He also thus betook himself to rest under the consideration of the little effect that his ministry had in Capernaum, Chorazin, and Bethsaida: ""I thank thee, O Father,"" said he, ""Lord of heaven and earth, because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes; even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight"" (Matt 11:25; Luke 10:21).","The text, in the general, standeth of TWO PARTS, and hath special respect to the Father and the Son; as also to their joint management of the salvation of the people: ""All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""","The first part of the text, as is evident, respecteth the Father and his gift; the other part the Son and his reception of that gift.","FIRST, For the gift of the Father there is this to be considered, to wit, the gift itself; and that is the gift of certain persons to the Son.","The Father giveth, and that gift shall come: ""And him that cometh.""","The gift, then, is of persons; the Father giveth persons to Jesus Christ.","SECOND, Next you have the Son's reception of this gift, and that showeth itself in these particulars:--1.","In his hearty acknowledgement of it to be a gift: ""The Father giveth me.""",2.,"In his taking notice, after a solemn manner, of all and every part of the gift: ""All that the Father giveth me.""",3.,"In his resolution to bring them to himself: ""All that the Father giveth me shall come to me.""",4.,"And in his determining that not anything shall make him dislike them in their coming: ""And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""","These things might be spoken to at large, as they are in this method presented to view: but I shall choose to speak to the words, FIRST, BY WAY OF EXPLICATION.","SECOND, BY WAY OF OBSERVATION.","[FIRST, THE TEXT TREATED BY WAY OF EXPLICATION.]",[THE EXTENT OF THE GIFT.],"""All that the Father giveth me.""","This word all, is often used in Scripture, and is to be taken more largely, or more strictly, even as the truth or argument, for the sake of which it is made use of, will bear.","Wherefore, that we may the better understand the mind of Christ in the use of it here, we must consider, that it is limited and restrained only to those that shall be saved, to wit, to those that shall come to Christ; even to those whom he will ""in no wise cast out.""","Thus, also, the words all Israel, is sometimes to be taken, although sometimes it is taken for the whole family of Jacob.","""And so all Israel shall be saved"" (Rom 11:26).","By all Israel here, he intendeth not all of Israel, in the largest sense; ""for they are not all Israel which are of Israel;"" ""neither because they are of the seed of Abraham, are they all children; but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.","That is, they which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for the seed"" (Rom 9:6-8).","This word ALL, therefore, must be limited and enlarged, as the truth and argument, for the sake of which it is used, will bear; else we shall abuse Scripture, and readers, and ourselves, and all.","""And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,"" said Christ, ""will draw ALL men unto me"" (John 12:32).","Can any man imagine, that by ALL, in this place, he should mean all and every individual man in the world, and not rather that all that is consonant to the scope of the place?","And if, by being ""lifted up from the earth,"" he means, as he should seem, his being taken up into heaven; and if, by ""drawing ALL men after him,"" he meant a drawing them unto that place of glory; then must he mean by ALL men, those, and only those, that shall in truth be eternally saved from the wrath to come.","""For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all"" (Rom 11:32).","Here again you have all and all, two alls; but yet a greater disparity between the all made mention of in the first place, and that all made mention of the second.","Those intended in this text are the Jews, even all of them, by the first all that you find in the words.",The second all doth also intend the same people; but yet only so many of them as God will have mercy upon.,"""He hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.""","The all also in the text, is likewise to be limited and restrained to the saved, and to them only.","But again;-- The word ""giveth,"" or ""hath given,"" must be restrained, after the same manner, to the same limited number.","""All that the Father giveth me.""","Not all that are given, if you take the gift of the Father to the Son in the largest sense; for in that sense there are many given to him that shall never come unto him; yea, many are given unto him that he will ""cast out.""","I shall, therefore, first show you the truth of this; and then in what sense the gift in the text must be taken.","First, [ALL cannot be intended in its largest sense.]","That ALL that are given to Christ, if you take the gift of the Father to him in the largest sense, cannot be intended in the text, is evident-- 1.","Because, then, all the men, yea, all the things in the world, must be saved.","""All things,"" saith he, ""are delivered unto me of my Father"" (Matt 11:27).","This, I think, no rational man in the world will conclude.","Therefore, the gift intended in the text must be restrained to some, to a gift that is given by way of speciality by the Father to the Son.",2.,"It must not be taken for ALL, that in any sense are given by the Father to him, because the Father hath given some, yea, many to him, to be dashed in pieces by him.","""Ask of me,"" said the Father to him, ""and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.""",But what must be done with them?,must he save them all?,No.,"""Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel"" (Psa 2).","This method he useth not with them that he saveth by his grace, but with those that himself and saints shall rule over in justice and severity (Rev 2:26,27).","Yet, as you see, ""they are given to him.""","Therefore, the gift intended in the text must be restrained to some, to a gift that is given by way of speciality by the Father to the Son.","In Psalm 18 he saith plainly, that some are given to him that he might destroy them.","""Thou hast given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me"" (verse 40).","These, therefore, cannot be of the number of those that are said to be given in the text; for those, even ALL of them, shall come to him, ""and he will in no wise cast them out.""",3.,"Some are given to Christ, that he by them might bring about some of his high and deep designs in the world.","Thus Judas was given to Christ, to wit, that by him, even as was determined before, he might bring about his death, and so the salvation of his elect by his blood.","Yea, and Judas must so manage this business, as that he must lose himself for ever in bringing it to pass.","Therefore the Lord Jesus, even in his losing of Judas, applies himself to the judgment of his Father, if he had not in that thing done that which was right, even in suffering of Judas so to bring about his Master's death, as that he might, by so doing, bring about his own eternal damnation also.","""Those,"" said he, ""that thou gavest me, I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled"" (John 17:12).","Let us, then, grant that Judas was given to Christ, but not as others are given to him, not as those made mention of in the text; for then he should have failed to have been so received by Christ, and kept to eternal life.","Indeed, he was given to Christ; but he was given to him to lose him, in the way that I have mentioned before; he was given to Christ, that he by him might bring about his own death, as was before determined; and that in the overthrow of him that did it.","Yea, he must bring about his own death, as was before determined, and that in the overthrow of him that did it.","Yea, he must bring about his dying for us in the loss of the instrument that betrayed him, that he might even fulfil the Scripture in his destruction, as well as in the salvation of the rest.","""And none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled.""","[Second, Those intended as the gift.]","--The gift, therefore, in the text, must not be taken in the largest sense, but even as the words will bear, to wit, for such a gift as he accepteth, and promiseth to be an effectual means of eternal salvation to.","""All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""",Mark!,they shall come that are in special given to me; and they shall by no means be rejected.,For this is the substance of the text.,"Those, therefore, intended as the gift in the text, are those that are given by covenant to the Son; those that in other places are called ""the elect,"" ""the chosen,"" ""the sheep,"" and ""the children of the promise,"" &c. These be they that the Father hath given to Christ to keep them; those that Christ hath promised eternal life unto; those to whom he hath given his word, and that he will have with him in his kingdom to behold his glory.","""This is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day"" (John 6:39).","""And I give unto them eternal life;

that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world"" (John 17:1,6,9,10,24).","All these sentences are of the same import with the text; and the alls and manies, those, they, &c., in these several sayings of Christ, are the same with all the given in the text.","""All that the Father giveth.""","So that, as I said before, the word ALL, as also other words, must not be taken in such sort as our foolish fancies or groundless opinions will prompt us to, but do admit of an enlargement or a restriction, according to the true meaning and intent of the text.","We must therefore diligently consult the meaning of the text, by comparing it with other the sayings of God; so shall we be better able to find out the mind of the Lord, in the word which he has given us to know it by.","[THE PERSON GIVING, THE FATHER.]","""All that the Father giveth.""","By this word ""Father,"" Christ describeth the person giving; by which we may learn several useful things.","First, That the Lord God, and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is concerned with the Son in the salvation of his people.","True, his acts, as to our salvation, are diverse from those of the Son; he was not capable of doing that, or those things for us, as did the Son; he died not, he spilt not blood for our redemption, as the Son; but yet he hath a hand, a great hand, in our salvation too.","As Christ saith, ""The Father himself loveth you,"" and his love is manifest in choosing of us, in giving of us to his Son; yea, and in giving his Son also to be a ransom for us.","Hence he is called, ""The Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort.""","For here even the Father hath himself found out, and made way for his grace to come to us through the sides and the heart-blood of his well-beloved Son (Col 1:12-14).","The Father, therefore, is to be remembered and adored, as one having a chief hand in the salvation of sinners.","We ought to give ""thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light"" (Col 1:12).","For ""the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world"" (John 4:14).","As also we see in the text, the ""Father giveth"" the sinner to Christ to save him.","Second, Christ Jesus the Lord, by this word ""Father,"" would familiarize this giver to us.","Naturally the name of God is dreadful to us, especially when he is discovered to us by those names that declare his justice, holiness, power, and glory; but now this word ""Father"" is a familiar word, it frighteth not the sinner, but rather inclineth his heart to love, and be pleased with the remembrance of him.","Hence Christ also, when he would have us to pray with godly boldness, puts this word ""Father"" into our mouths; saying, ""When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven;"" concluding thereby, that by the familiarity that by such a word is intimated, the children of God may take more boldness to pray for, and ask great things.","I myself have often found, that when I can say but this word Father, it doth me more good than when I call him by any other Scripture name.","It is worth your noting, that to call God by his relative title was rare among the saints in Old Testament times.","Seldom do you find him called by this name; no, sometimes not in three or four books: but now in New Testament times, he is called by no name so often as this, both by the Lord Jesus himself, and by the apostles afterwards.","Indeed, the Lord Jesus was he that first made this name common among the saints, and that taught them, both in their discourses, their prayers, and in their writings, so much to use it; it being more pleasing to, and discovering more plainly our interest in, God, than any other expression; for by this one name we are made to understand that all our mercies are the offspring of God, and that we also that are called are his children by adoption.",[Import of the word GIVETH.],"--""All that the Father giveth.""","This word ""giveth"" is out of Christ's ordinary dialect, and seemeth to intimate, at the first sound, as if the Father's gift to the Son was not an act that is past, but one that is present and continuing; when, indeed, this gift was bestowed upon Christ when the covenant, the eternal covenant, was made between them before all worlds.","Wherefore, in those other places, when this gift is mentioned, it is still spoken of, as of an act that is past; as, ""All that he hath give me; to as many as thou hast given me; thou gavest them me; and those which thou hast given me.""","Therefore, of necessity, this must be the first and chief sense of the text; I mean of this word ""giveth,"" otherwise the doctrine of election, and of the eternal covenant which was made between the Father and the Son, in which covenant this gift of the Father is most certainly comprised, will be shaken, or at leastwise questionable, by erroneous and wicked men: for they may say, That the Father gave not all those to Christ that shall be saved, before the world was made; for that this act of giving is an act of continuation.","3 But again, this word ""giveth"" is not to be rejected, for it hath its proper use, and may signify to us-- 1.","That though the act of giving among men doth admit of the time past, or the time to come, and is to be spoken of with reference to such time; yet with God it is not so.","Things past, or things to come, are always present with God, and with his Son Jesus Christ: He ""calleth those things which be not,"" that is, to us, ""as though they were"" (Rom 4:17).","And again, ""Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.""","All things to God are present, and so the gift of the Father to the Son, although to us, as is manifest by the word, it is an act that is past (Acts 15:16).",2.,"Christ may express himself thus, to show, that the Father hath not only given him this portion in the lump, before the world was, but that those that he had so given, he will give him again; that is, will bring them to him at the time of their conversion; for the Father bringeth them to Christ (John 6:44).","As it is said, ""She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needle-work;"" that is, in the righteousness of Christ; for it is God that imputeth that to those that are saved (Psa 45:14; 1 Cor 1).","A man giveth his daughter to such a man, first in order to marriage, and this respects the time past, and he giveth her again at the day appointed in marriage.","And in this last sense, perhaps, the text may have a meaning; that is, that all that the Father hath, before the world was, given to Jesus Christ, he giveth them again to him in the day of their espousals.","Things that are given among men, are ofttimes best at first; to wit, when they are new; and the reason is, because all earthly things wax old; but with Christ it is not so.","This gift of the Father is not old and deformed, and unpleasant in his eyes; and therefore to him it is always new.","When the Lord spake of giving the land of Canaan to the Israelites, he saith not, that he had given, or would give it to them, but thus: ""The Lord thy God giveth thee--this good land"" (Deut 9:6).","Not but that he had given it to them, while they were in the loins of their fathers, hundreds of years before.","Yet he saith now he giveth it to them; as if they were now also in the very act of taking possession, when as yet they were on the other side Jordan.",What then should be the meaning?,"Why, I take it to be this.",That the land should be to them always as new; as new as if they were taking possession thereof but now.,"And so is the gift of the Father, mentioned in the text, to the Son; it is always new, as if it were always new.","""All that the Father giveth me.""","In these words you find mention made of two persons, the Father and the Son; the Father giving, and the Son receiving or accepting of this gift.","This, then, in the first place, clearly demonstrateth, that the Father and the Son, though they, with the Holy Ghost, are one and the same eternal God; yet, as to their personality, are distinct.","The Father is one, the Son is one, the Holy Spirit is one.","But because there is in this text mention made but of two of the three, therefore a word about these two.","The giver and receiver cannot be the same person in a proper sense, in the same act of giving and receiving.","He that giveth, giveth not to himself, but to another; the Father giveth not to the Father, to wit, to himself, but to the Son: the Son receiveth not of the Son, to wit, of himself, but of the Father: so when the Father giveth commandment, he giveth it not to himself, but to another; as Christ saith, ""He gave me a commandment"" (John 12:49).","So again, ""I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me"" (John 8:18).","Further, here is something implied that is not expressed, to wit, that the Father hath not given all men to Christ; that is, in that sense as it is intended in this text, though in a larger, as was said before, he hath given him every one of them; for then all should be saved: he hath, therefore, disposed of some another way.","He gives some up to idolatry; he gives some up to uncleanness, to vile affections, and to a reprobate mind.","Now these he disposeth of in his anger, for their destruction, that they may reap the fruit of their doings, and be filled with the reward of their own ways (Acts 7:42; Rom 1:24,26,28).","But neither hath he thus disposed of all men; he hath even of mercy reserved some from these judgments, and those are they that he will pardon, as he saith, ""For I will pardon them whom I reserve"" (Jer 50:20).","Now these he hath given to Jesus Christ, by will, as a legacy and portion.","Hence the Lord Jesus says, ""This is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day"" (John 6:39).",[THE FATHER'S INTENT IN GIVING.],"The Father, therefore, in giving of them to him to save them, must needs declare unto us these following things:-- First, That he is able to answer this design of God, to wit, to save them to the uttermost sin, the uttermost temptation, &c. (Heb 7:25).","Hence he is said to lay ""help upon one that is mighty,"" ""mighty to save"" (Psa 89:19; Isa 63:1) and hence it is again, that God did even of old promise to send his people ""a Saviour, a great one"" (Isa 19:20).","To save is a great work, and calls for almightiness in the undertaker: hence he is called the ""Mighty God, the wonderful Counsellor,"" &c. Sin is strong, Satan is also strong, death and the grave are strong, and so is the curse of the law; therefore it follows, that this Jesus must needs be, by God the Father, accounted almighty, in that he hath given his elect to him to save them, and deliver them from these, and that in despite of all their force and power.","And he gave us testimony of this his might, when he was employed in that part of our deliverance that called for a declaration of it.","He abolished death; he destroyed him that had the power of death; he was the destruction of the grave; he hath finished sin, and made an end of it, as to its damning effects upon the persons that the Father hath given him; he hath vanquished the curse of the law, nailed it to his cross, triumphed over them upon his cross, and made a show of these things openly (2 Tim 1:10; Heb 2:14,15; Hosea 13:14; Dan 9:24; Gal 3:13; Col 2:14,15).","Yea, and even now, as a sign of his triumph and conquest, he is alive from the dead, and hath the keys of hell and death in his own keeping (Rev 1:18).","Second, The Father's giving of them to him to save them, declares unto us that he is and will be faithful in his office of Mediator, and that therefore they shall be secured from the fruit and wages of their sins, which is eternal damnation, by his faithful execution of it.","And, indeed, it is said, even by the Holy Ghost himself, That he ""was faithful to him that appointed him,"" that is, to this work of saving those that the Father hath given him for that purpose; as ""Moses was faithful in all his house.""","Yea, and more faithful too, for Moses was faithful in God's house but as a servant; ""but Christ as a Son over his own house"" (Heb 3).","And therefore this man is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, even upon this account, because more faithful than he, as well as because of the dignity of his person.","Therefore in him, and in his truth and faithfulness, God resteth well pleased, and hath put all the government of this people upon his shoulders.","Knowing that nothing shall be wanting in him, that may any way perfect this design.","And of this he, to wit, the Son, hath already given a proof.","For when the time was come, that his blood was, by Divine justice, required for their redemption, washing, and cleansing, he as freely poured it out of his heart, as if it had been water out of a vessel; not sticking to part with his own life, that the life which was laid up for his people in heaven might not fail to be bestowed upon them.","And upon this account, as well as upon any other, it is that God calleth him ""my righteous servant"" (Isa 53:11).","For his righteousness could never have been complete, if he had not been to the uttermost faithful to the work he undertook; it is also, because he is faithful and true, that in righteousness he doth judge and make work for his people's deliverance.",He will faithfully perform this trust reposed in him.,"The Father knows this, and hath therefore given his elect unto him.","Third, The Father's giving of them to him, to save them, declares that he is, and will be gentle, and patient towards them, under all their provocations and miscarriages.","It is not to be imagined, the trials and provocations that the Son of God hath all along had with these people that have been given to him that saves them: indeed he is said to be ""a tried stone;"" for he has been tried, not only by the devil, guilt of sin, death, and the curse of the law, but also by his people's ignorance, unruliness, falls into sin, and declining to errors in life and doctrine.","Were we but capable of seeing how this Lord Jesus has been tried even by his people, ever since there was one of them in the world, we should be amazed at his patience and gentle carriages to them.","It is said, indeed, ""The Lord is very pitiful, slow to anger, and of great mercy.""","And, indeed, if he had not been so, he could never have endured their manners as he has done from Adam hitherto.",Therefore is his pity and bowels towards his church preferred above the pity and bowels of a mother towards her child.,"""Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?","Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee,"" saith the Lord (Isa 49:15).","God did once give Moses, as Christ's servant, an handful of his people, to carry them in his bosom, but no further than from Egypt to Canaan; and this Moses, as is said of him by the Holy Ghost, was the meekest man that was then to be found in the earth; yea, and he loved the people at a very great rate; yet neither would his meekness nor love hold out in this work; he failed and grew passionate, even to the provoking his God to anger under this work.","""And Moses said unto the Lord, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant?""",But what was the affliction?,"Why, the Lord had said unto him, ""Carry this people in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the suckling child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers.""",And how then?,"Not I, says Moses, ""I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.","If thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, and let me not see my wretchedness"" (Num 11:11-15).","God gave them to Moses, that he might carry them in his bosom, that he might show gentleness and patience towards them, under all the provocations wherewith they would provoke him from that time till he had brought them to their land; but he failed in the work; he could not exercise it, because he had not that sufficiency of patience towards them.","But now it is said of the person speaking in the text, ""That he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young"" (Isa 40:11).","Intimating, that this was one of the qualifications that God looked for, and knew was in him, when he gave his elect to him to save them.","Fourth, The Father giving of him to save them, declares that he hath a sufficiency of wisdom to wage with all those difficulties that would attend him in his bringing of his sons and daughters unto glory.","He made him to us to be wisdom; yea, he is called wisdom itself (1 Cor 1:30).","And God saith, moreover, That ""he shall deal prudently"" (Isa 52:13).","And, indeed, he that shall take upon him to be the Saviour of the people, had need be wise, because their adversaries are subtle above any.","Here they are to encounter with the serpent, who for his subtilty outwitted our father and mother, when their wisdom was at highest (Gen 3).","But if we talk of wisdom, our Jesus is wise, wiser than Solomon, wiser than all men, wiser than all angels; he is even the wisdom of God.","""Christ is the wisdom of God"" (1 Cor 1:24).","And hence it is that he turneth sin, temptations, persecutions, falls, and all things, for good unto his people (Rom 8:28).","Now these things thus concluded on do show us also the great and wonderful love of the Father, in that he should choose out one every way so well prepared for the work of man's salvation.","Herein, indeed, perceive we the love of God.","Huram gathered, that God loved Israel because he had given them such a king as Solomon (2 Chron 2:11).","But how much more may we behold the love that God hath bestowed upon us, in that he hath given us to his Son, and also given his Son for us?",[THE SON'S RECEPTION OF THE GIFT.],"""All that the Father giveth me SHALL COME.""",In these last words there is closely inserted an answer unto the Father's end in giving of his elect to Jesus Christ.,"The Father's end was, that they might come to him, and be saved by him; and that, says the Son, shall be done; neither sin nor Satan, neither flesh nor world, neither wisdom nor folly, shall hinder their coming to me.","""They shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""","Here, therefore, the Lord Jesus positively determineth to put forth such a sufficiency of all grace as shall effectually perform this promise.","""They shall come;"" that is, he will cause them to come, by infusing of an effectual blessing into all the means that shall be used to that end.","As was said to the evil spirit that was sent to persuade Ahab to go and fall at Ramoth-Gilead; Go: ""Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so"" (1 Kings 22:22).",So will Jesus Christ say to the means that shall be used for the bringing of those to him that the Father hath given him.,"I say, he will bless it effectually to this very end; it shall persuade them, and shall prevail also; else, as I said, the Father's end would be frustrate; for the Father's will is, that ""of all which he hath given him, he should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day,"" (John 6:39); in order next unto himself, Christ the first-fruits, afterwards those that are his at his coming (1 Cor 15).","But this cannot be done if there should fail to be a work of grace effectually wrought, though but in any one of them.","But this shall not fail to be wrought in them, even in all the Father hath given him to save.","""All that the Father hath given me shall come unto me,"" &c. But to speak more distinctly to the words, THEY ""SHALL COME,"" two things I would show you from these words--FIRST, What it is to come to Christ.","SECOND, What force there is in this promise, to make them come to him.",[WHAT IT IS TO COME TO CHRIST.],"FIRST, I would show you WHAT IT IS TO COME TO CHRIST.","This word come must be understood spiritually, not carnally; for many came to him carnally, or bodily, that had no saving advantage by him.","Multitudes did thus come unto him in the days of his flesh; yea, innumerable companies.","There is also at this day a formal customary coming to his ordinances and ways of worship, which availeth not anything; but with them I shall not now meddle, for they are not intended in the text.","The coming, then, intended in the text is to be understood of the coming of the mind to him, even the moving of the heart towards him.","I say the moving of the heart towards him, from a sound sense of the absolute want that a man hath of him for his justification and salvation.","This description of coming to Christ divideth itself into two heads: First, That coming to Christ is a moving of the mind towards him.","Second, That it is a moving of the mind towards him, from a sound sense of the absolute want that a man hath of him for his justification and salvation.",[First.],"To speak to the first, that it is a moving of the mind towards him.","This is evident; because coming hither or thither, if it be voluntary, is by an act of the mind or will; so coming to Christ is through the inclining of the will.","""Thy people shall be willing"" (Psa 110:3).",This willingness of heart is it which sets the mind a-moving after or towards him.,The church expresseth this moving of her mind towards Christ by the moving of her bowels.,"""My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him"" (Can 5:4).","""My bowels;"" the passions of my mind and affections; which passions of the affections are expressed by the yearning and sounding of the bowels, the yearning or passionate working of them, the sounding of them, or their making a noise for him (Gen 43:30; 1 Kings 3:26; Isa 16:11).","This, then, is the coming to Christ, even a moving towards him with the mind.","4 ""And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live"" (Eze 47:9).",The water in this text is the grace of God in the doctrine of it.,"The living things are the children of men, to whom the grace of God, by the gospel, is preached.","Now, saith he, every living thing which moveth, whithersoever the water shall come, shall live.","And see how this word moveth is expounded by Christ himself, in the book of the Revelations: ""The Spirit and the bride say, Come.","And let him that heareth say, Come.","And let him that is athirst, come.","And whosoever will,"" that is, willing, ""let him take the water of life freely"" (Rev 22:17).","So that to move in thy mind and will after Christ, is to be coming to him.","There are many poor souls that are coming to Christ, that yet cannot tell how to believe it, because they think that coming to him is some strange and wonderful thing; and, indeed, so it is.","But I mean, they overlook the inclination of their will, the moving of their mind, and the sounding of their bowels after him; and count these none of this strange and wonderful thing; when, indeed, it is a work of greatest wonder in this world, to see a man who was sometimes dead in sin possessed of the devil, an enemy to Christ and to all things spiritually good; I say, to see this man moving with his mind after the Lord Jesus Christ, is one of the highest wonders in the world.","Second, It is a moving of the mind towards him, from a sound sense of the absolute want that a man hath of him for his justification and salvation.","Indeed, without this sense of a lost condition without him, there will be no moving of the mind towards him.","A moving of their mouth there may be; ""With their mouth they show much love"" (Eze 33:31).","Such a people as this will come as the true people cometh; that is, in show and outward appearance.","And they will sit before God's ministers, as his people sit before them; and they will hear his words too, but they will not do them; that is, will not come inwardly with their minds.","""For with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart,"" or mind, ""goeth after their covetousness.""","Now, all this is because they want an effectual sense of the misery of their state by nature; for not till they have that will they, in their mind, move after him.","Therefore, thus it is said concerning the true comers, At ""that day the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the Lord in the holy mount at Jerusalem"" (Isa 27:13).","They are then, as you see, the outcasts, and those that are ready to perish, that, indeed, have their minds effectually moved to come to Jesus Christ.","This sense of things was that which made the three thousand come, that made Saul come, that made the jailer come, and that, indeed, makes all others come, that come effectually (Acts 2:8,18).","Of the true coming to Christ, the four lepers were a famous semblance, of whom you read, (2 Kings 7:3), &c. The famine in those days was sore in the land, there was no bread for the people; and as for that sustenance that was, which was asses' flesh and doves' dung, that was only in Samaria, and of these the lepers had no share, for they were thrust without the city.","Well, now they sat in the gate of the city, and hunger was, as I may say, making his last meal of them; and being, therefore, half dead already, what do they think of doing?","Why, first they display the dismal colours of death before each other's faces, and then resolve what to do, saying, ""If we say we will enter into the city, then famine is in the city, and we shall die there: if we sit still here, we die also.","Now, therefore, come, let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; if they kill us, we shall but die.""","Here, now, was necessity at work, and this necessity drove them to go thither for life, whither else they would never have gone for it.",Thus it is with them that in truth come to Jesus Christ.,"Death is before them, they see it and feel it; he is feeding upon them, and will eat them quite up, if they come not to Jesus Christ; and therefore they come, even of necessity, being forced thereto by that sense they have of their being utterly and everlastingly undone, if they find not safety in him.",These are they that will come.,"Indeed, these are they that are invited to come.","""Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest"" (Matt 11:28).","Take two or three things to make this more plain; to wit, That coming to Christ floweth from a sound sense of the absolute need that a man hath of him, as afore.",1.,"""They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them; I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble"" (Jer 31:9).",Mind it; they come with weeping and supplication; they come with prayers and tears.,Now prayers and tears are the effects of a right sense of the need of mercy.,"Thus a senseless sinner cannot come, he cannot pray, he cannot cry, he cannot come sensible of what he sees not, nor feels.","""In those days, and in that time--the children of Israel shall come; they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go and seek the Lord their God.","They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten"" (Jer 1:4,5).",2.,"This coming to Christ, it is called a running to him, as flying to him; a flying to him from wrath to come.","By all which terms is set forth the sense of the man that comes; to wit, That he is affected with the sense of his sin, and the death due thereto; that he is sensible that the avenger of blood pursues him, and that, therefore, he is thus off, if he makes not speed to the Son of God for life (Matt 3:7; Psa 143:9).","Flying is the last work of a man in danger; all that are in danger do not fly; no, not all that see themselves in danger; flying is the last work of a man in danger; all that hear of danger will not fly.",Men will consider if there be no other way of escape before they fly.,"Therefore, as I said, flying is the last thing.","When all refuge fails, and a man is made to see that there is nothing left him but sin, death, and damnation, unless he flies to Christ for life; then he flies, and not till then.",3.,"That the true coming is from a sense of an absolute need of Jesus Christ to save, &c., is evident by the outcry that is made by them to come, even as they are coming to him, ""Lord, save me,"" or I perish; ""Men and brethren, what shall we do?""","""Sirs, what must I do to be saved?""",and the like (Matt 14:30; Acts 2:37; 16:30).,"This language doth sufficiently discover that the truly-coming souls are souls sensible of their need of salvation by Jesus Christ; and, moreover, that there is nothing else that can help them but Christ.",4.,"It is yet further evident by these few things that follow: It is said that such are ""pricked in their heart,"" that is, with the sentence of death by the law; and the least prick in the heart kills a man (Acts 2:37).","Such are said, as I said before, to weep, to tremble, and to be astonished in themselves at the evident and unavoidable danger that attends them, unless they fly to Jesus Christ (Acts 9:16).",5.,Coming to Christ is attended with an honest and sincere forsaking of all for him.,"""If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.","And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple"" (Luke 14:26,27).","By these and the like expressions elsewhere, Christ describeth the true comer, or the man that indeed is coming to him; he is one that casteth all behind his back; he leaveth all, he forsaketh all, he hateth all things that would stand in his way to hinder his coming to Jesus Christ.","There are a great many pretended comers to Jesus Christ in the world; and they are much like to the man you read of in Matthew 21:30, that said to his father's bidding, ""I go, Sir, and went not.""","I say, there are a great many such comers to Jesus Christ; they say, when Christ calls by his gospel, I come, Sir; but still they abide by their pleasures and carnal delights.","They come not at all, only they give him a courtly compliment; but he takes notice of it, and will not let it pass for any more than a lie.","He said, ""I go, Sir, and went not;"" he dissembled and lied.","Take heed of this, you that flatter yourselves with your own deceivings.",Words will not do with Jesus Christ.,"Coming is coming, and nothing else will go for coming with him.",[Objections that usually lie in the way of coming to Christ.],"Before I speak to the other head, I shall answer some objections that usually lie in the way of those that in truth are coming to Jesus Christ.",Objection 1.,"Though I cannot deny but my mind runs after Christ, and that too as being moved thereto from a sight and consideration of my lost condition, for I see without him I perish; yet I fear my ends are not right in coming to him.",Quest.,"Why, what is thine end in coming to Christ?",Answ.,"My end is, that I might have life, and be saved by Jesus Christ.","This is the objection; well, let me tell thee, that to come to Christ for life, and to be saved, although at present thou hast no other end, is a lawful and good coming to Jesus Christ.","This is evident, because Christ propoundeth life as the only argument to prevail with sinners to come to him, and so also blameth them because they come not to him for life.","""And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life"" (John 5:40).","Besides, there are many other scriptures whereby he allureth sinners to come to him, in which he propoundeth nothing to them but their safety.","As, ""whosoever believeth in him should not perish;"" he that believeth is ""passed from death unto life.""","""He that believeth--shall be saved.""","""He that believeth on him is not condemned.""",And believing and coming are all one.,"So that you see, to come to Christ for life, is a lawful coming and good.","In that he believeth, that he alone hath made atonement for sin (Rom 2).","And let me add over and above, that for a man to come to Christ for life, though he comes to him for nothing else but life, it is to give much honour to him.",1.,"He honoureth the word of Christ, and consenteth to the truth of it; and that in these two general heads.",(1.),"He consenteth to the truth of all those sayings that testify that sin is most abominable in itself, dishonourable to God, and damnable to the soul of man; for thus saith the man that cometh to Jesus Christ (Jer 44:4; Rom 2:23; 6:23; 2 Thess 2:12).",(2.),"In that he believeth, as the word hath said, that there is in the world's best things, righteousness and all, nothing but death and damnation; for so also says the man that comes to Jesus Christ for life (Rom 7:24,25; 8:2,3; 2 Cor 3:6-8).",2.,"He honoureth Christ's person, in that he believeth that there is life in him, and that he is able to save him from death, hell, the devil, and damnation; for unless a man believes this, he will not come to Christ for life (Heb 7:24,25).",3.,"He honoureth him, in that he believeth that he is authorized of the Father to give life to those that come to him for it (John 5:11,12; 17:1-3).",4.,He honoureth the priesthood of Jesus Christ.,(1.),"In that he believeth that Christ hath more power to save from sin by the sacrifice that he hath offered for it, than hath all law, devils, death, or sin to condemn.","He that believes not this, will not come to Jesus Christ for life (Acts 13:38; Heb 2:14,15; Rev 1:17,18).",(2.),"In that he believeth that Christ, according to his office, will be most faithful and merciful in the discharge of his office.","This must be included in the faith of him that comes for life to Jesus Christ (1 John 2:1-3; Heb 2:17,18).",5.,"Further, He that cometh to Jesus Christ for life, taketh part with him against sin, and against the ragged and imperfect righteousness of the world; yea, and against false Christs, and damnable errors, that set themselves against the worthiness of his merits and sufficiency.","This is evident, for that such a soul singleth Christ out from them all, as the only one that can save.",6.,"Therefore as Noah, at God's command, thou preparest this ark, for the saving of thyself, by which also thou condemnest the world, and art become heir of the righteousness which is by faith (Heb 11:7).","Wherefore, coming sinner, be content; he that cometh to Jesus Christ, believeth too that he is willing to show mercy to, and have compassion upon him, though unworthy, that comes to him for life.","And therefore thy soul lieth not only under a special invitation to come, but under a promise too of being accepted and forgiven (Matt 11:28).","All these particular parts and qualities of faith are in that soul that comes to Jesus Christ for life, as is evident to any indifferent judgment.","For, will he that believeth not the testimony of Christ concerning the baseness of sin, and the insufficiency of the righteousness of the world, come to Christ for life?",No.,"He that believeth not this testimony of the word, comes not.","He that believeth that there is life anywhere else, comes not.","He that questions whether the Father hath given Christ power to forgive, comes not.","He that thinketh that there is more in sin, in the law, in death, and the devil, to destroy, than there is in Christ to save, comes not.","He also that questions his faithful management of his priesthood for the salvation of sinners, comes not.","Thou, then, that art indeed the coming sinner, believest all this.","True, perhaps thou dost not believe with that full assurance, nor hast thou leisure to take notice of thy faith as to these distinct acts of it; but yet all this faith is in him coming to Christ for life.","And the faith that thus worketh, is the faith of the best and purest kind; because this man comes alone as a sinner, and as seeing that life is, and is to be had only in Jesus Christ.","Before I conclude my answer to this objection, take into thy consideration these two things.",1st.,"[Consider] that the cities of refuge were erected for those that were dead in law, and that yet would live by grace; even for those that were to fly thither for life from the avenger of blood that pursueth after them.","And it is worth your noting, that those that were upon their flight thither, are in a peculiar manner called the people of God: ""Cast ye up, cast ye up,"" saith God; ""prepare the way; take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people"" (Isa 57:14).","This is meant of preparing the way to the city of refuge, that the slayers might escape thither; which flying slayers are here, by way of specialty, called the people of God;

Rom 15:12).","The conditional promise calls for a new heart, the absolute promise gives it (Eze 36:25,26).","The conditional promise calleth for holy obedience, the absolute promise giveth it, or causeth it (Eze 36:27).",5.,"And as they harmoniously agree in this, so again the conditional promise blesseth the man, who by the absolute promise is endued with its fruit.","As, for instance, the absolute promise maketh men upright; and then the conditional follows, saying, ""Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord"" (Psa 119:1).","The absolute promise giveth to this man the fear of the Lord; and then the conditional followeth, saying, ""Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord"" (Psa 128:1).","The absolute promise giveth faith, and then this conditional follows, saying, ""Blessed is she that believed"" (Zeph 3:12;

but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform"" (Rev 4:20,21).","But was not his faith exercised, or tried, about his willingness too?","No, there was no show of reason for that, because he had promised it.","Indeed, had he not promised it, he might lawfully have doubted it; but since he had promised it, there was left no ground at all for doubting, because his willingness to give a son was demonstrated in his promising him a son.","These words, therefore, are sufficient ground to encourage any coming sinner that Christ is willing to his power to receive him; and since he hath power also to do what he will, there is no ground at all left to the coming sinner any more to doubt; but to come in full hope of acceptance, and of being received unto grace and mercy.","""And him that cometh.""","He saith not, and him that is come;

and so is able to make the best judgment of his wonderful grace and beauty, as God saith, ""Let them come near, then let them speak"" (Isa 41:1).","And as the apostle John saith, ""And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world"" (1 John 4:14).","He that is not yet come, though he is coming, is not fit, not being indeed capable to make that judgment of the worth and glory of the grace of Christ, as he is that is come to him, and hath seen and beheld it.","Therefore, sinner, suspend thy judgment till thou art come nearer.",2.,"He that is come to Christ has the advantage of him that is but coming, in that he is eased of his burden;

but when he was come to the city, and was entered thereinto, that noise ceased.","Even so it is with him that is but coming to Jesus Christ, he heareth many a dreadful sound in is ear; sounds of death and damnation, which he that is come is at present freed from.","Therefore he saith, ""Come, and I will give you rest.""","And so he saith again, ""We that have believed, do enter into rest,"" as he said, &c.

and my groaning is not hid from thee"" (Psa 38:9).","This he spake, as he was coming, after he had backslidden, to the Lord Jesus Christ.","It is said of the prodigal, that while he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, had his eye upon him, and upon the going out of his heart after him (Luke 15:20).","When Nathanael was come to Jesus Christ, the Lord said to them that stood before him, ""Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.""","But Nathanael answered him, ""Whence knowest thou me?""","Jesus answered, ""Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.""","There, I suppose, Nathanael was pouring out of his soul to God for mercy, or that he would give him good understanding about the Messias to come; and Jesus saw all the workings of his honest heart at that time (John 1:47,48).","Zaccheus also had some secret movings of heart, such as they were, towards Jesus Christ, when he ran before, and climbed up the tree to see him; and the Lord Jesus Christ had his eye upon him: therefore, when he was come to the place, he looked up to him, bids him come down, ""For today,"" said he, ""I must abide at thy house;"" to wit, in order to the further completing the work of grace in his soul (Luke 19:1-9).","Remember this, coming sinner.",2.,"As Jesus Christ hath his eye upon, so he hath his heart open to receive, the coming sinner.","This is verified by the text: ""And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""","This is also discovered by his preparing of the way, in his making of it easy (as may be) to the coming sinner;

but he might for it thank a good Lord Jesus, because he did not resist him, but contrariwise, took up his cause, pleaded against the devil, excusing his infirmity, and put justifying robes upon him before his adversary's face.","""And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee.",Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?,"And he answered and spoke to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him; and unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment"" (Zech 3:2-4).","Again, how did Satan ply it against Peter, when he desired to have him, that he might sift him as wheat?","that is, if possible, sever all grace from his heart, and leave him nothing but flesh and filth, to the end that he might make the Lord Jesus loathe and abhor him.","""Simon, Simon,"" said Christ, ""Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.""",But did he prevail against him?,"No: ""But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.""","As who should say, Simon, Satan hath desired me that I would give thee up to him, and not only thee, but all the rest of thy brethren--for that the word you imports--but I will not leave thee in his hand: I have prayed for thee, thy faith shall not fail; I will secure thee to the heavenly inheritance (Luke 22:30-32).",(2.),"As Satan, so every sin of the coming sinner, comes in with a voice against him, if perhaps they may prevail with Christ to cast off the soul.","When Israel was coming out of Egypt to Canaan, how many times had their sins thrown them out of the mercy of God, had not Moses, as a type of Christ, stood in the breach to turn away his wrath from them!",(Psa 106:23).,"Our iniquities testify against us, and would certainly prevail against us, to our utter rejection and damnation, had we not an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous (1 John 2:1,2).","The sins of the old world cried them down to hell; the sins of Sodom fetched upon them fire from heaven, which devoured them; the sins of the Egyptians cried them down to hell, because they came not to Jesus Christ for life.","Coming sinner, thy sins are no whit less than any; nay, perhaps, they are as big as all theirs.","Why is it then, that thou livest when they are dead, and that thou hast a promise of pardon when they had not?","""Why, thou art coming to Jesus Christ;"" and therefore sin shall not be thy ruin.",(3.),"As Satan and sin, so the law of Moses, as it is a perfect holy law, hath a voice against you before the face of God.","""There is one that accuseth you, even Moses,"" his law (John 5:45).","Yea, it accuseth all men of transgression that have sinned against it; for as long as sin is sin, there will be a law to accuse for sin.","But this accusation shall not prevail against the coming sinner; because it is Christ that died, and that ever lives, to make intercession for them that ""come to God by him"" (Rom 8; Heb 7:25).","These things, I say, do accuse us before Christ Jesus; yea, and also to our own faces, if perhaps they might prevail against us.","But these words, ""I will in no wise cast out,"" secureth the coming sinner from them all.","The coming sinner is not saved, because there is none that comes in against him; but because the Lord Jesus will not hear their accusations, will not cast out the coming sinner.","When Shimei came down to meet king David, and to ask for pardon for his rebellion, up starts Abishai, and puts in his caveat, saying, Shall not Shimei die for this?",This is the case of him that comes to Christ.,"He hath this Abishai, and that Abishai, that presently steps in against him, saying, Shall not this rebel's sins destroy him in hell?",Read further.,"But David answered, ""What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me?","Shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel, for do not I know, that I am king this day over Israel?""",(2 Sam 19:16-22).,"That is Christ's answer by the text, to all that accuse the coming Shimeis.","What have I to do with you, that accuse the coming sinners to me?","I count you adversaries, that are against my showing mercy to them.","Do not I know that I am exalted this day to be king of righteousness, and king of peace?","""I will in no wise cast them out.""",2.,"But again, these words do closely imply, that the coming souls are afraid that these accusers will prevail against them, as is evident, because the text is spoken for their relief and succour.","For that need not be, if they that are coming were not subject to fear and despond upon this account.","Alas, there is guilt, and the curse lies upon the conscience of the coming sinner!","Besides, he is conscious to himself what a villain, what a wretch he hath been against God and Christ.","Also he now knows, by woeful experience, how he hath been at Satan's beck, and at the motion of every lust.",He hath now also new thoughts of the holiness and justice of God.,"Also he feels, that he cannot forbear sinning against him.","For the motions of sins, which are by the law, doth still work in his members, to bring forth fruit unto death (Rom 7:5).","But none of this needs be [a discouragement] since we have so good, so tender-hearted, and so faithful a Jesus to come to, who will rather overthrow heaven and earth, than suffer a tittle of this text to fail.","""And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""",[Import of the words TO CAST OUT.],"Now, we have yet to inquire into two things that lie in the words, to which there hath yet been nothing said.","As, FIRST, What it is to cast out.","SECOND, How it appears that Christ hath power to save or cast out?",[WHAT IT IS TO CAST OUT.],FIRST.,"For the first of these, What it is to cast out.","To this I will speak, First, Generally.","Second, More particularly.","[First, Generally.]",1.,"To cast out, is to slight and despise, and contemn;

if they have not, hell and damnation!",And for these reasons he must be judge:-- (1.),"Because of his humiliation, because of his Father's word he humbled himself, and he became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.","""Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;

but I shall not at this time speak to them all, but shall pass by the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth, partly because I design brevity, and partly because they are touched upon in the explicatory part of the text.","I shall therefore begin with the fifth observation, and so make that the first in order, in the following discourse.","[COMING TO CHRIST NOT BY THE POWER OF MAN, BUT BY THE DRAWING OF THE FATHER.]",OBSERVATION FIRST.,"First, then, coming to Christ is not by the will, wisdom, or power of man, but by the gift, promise, and drawing of the Father.",This observation standeth of two parts.,"First, The coming to Christ is not by the will, wisdom, or power of man; Second, But by the gift, promise, and drawing of the Father.","That the text carrieth this truth in its bosom, you will find if you look into the explication of the first part thereof before.","I shall, therefore, here follow the method propounded, viz: show, First, That coming to Christ is not by the will, wisdom, or power of man.","This is true, because the Word doth positively say it is not.",1.,It denieth it wholly to be by the will of man.,"""Not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man"" (John 1:13).","And again, ""It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth"" (Rom 9:16).",2.,"It denieth it to be of the wisdom of man, as is manifest from these considerations: (1.)","In the wisdom of God it pleased him, that the world by wisdom should not know him.","Now, if by their wisdom they cannot know him, it follows, by that wisdom, they cannot come unto him;

and I gather it, First, From the largeness and openness of the promise: ""I will in no wise cast out.""","For had there not been a proneness in us to ""fear casting out,"" Christ needed not to have, as it were, waylaid our fear, as he doth by this great and strange expression, ""In no wise;"" ""And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""","There needed not, as I may say, such a promise to be invented by the wisdom of heaven, and worded at such a rate, as it were on purpose to dash in pieces at one blow all the objections of coming sinners, if they were not prone to admit of such objections, to the discouraging of their own souls.","For this word, ""in no wise,"" cutteth the throat of all objections; and it was dropped by the Lord Jesus for that very end; and to help the faith that is mixed with unbelief.","And it is, as it were, the sum of all promises; neither can any objection be made upon the unworthiness that thou findest in thee, that this promise will not assoil.","But I am a great sinner, sayest thou.","""I will in no wise cast out,"" says Christ.","But I am an old sinner, sayest thou.","""I will in no wise cast out,"" says Christ.","But I am a hard-hearted sinner, sayest thou.","""I will in no wise cast out,"" says Christ.","But I am a backsliding sinner, sayest thou.","""I will in no wise cast out,"" says Christ.","But I have served Satan all my days, sayest thou.","""I will in no wise cast out,"" says Christ.","But I have sinned against light, sayest thou.","""I will in no wise cast out,"" says Christ.","But I have sinned against mercy, sayest thou.","""I will in no wise cast out,"" says Christ.","But I have no good thing to bring with me, sayest thou.","""I will in no wise cast out,"" says Christ.","Thus I might go on to the end of things, and show you, that still this promise was provided to answer all objections, and doth answer them.","But I say, what need it be, if they that are coming to Jesus Christ are not sometimes, yea, oftentimes, heartily afraid, ""that Jesus Christ will cast them out?""","Second, I will give you now two instances that seem to imply the truth of this observation.","In the ninth of Matthew, at the second verse, you read of a man that was sick of the palsy; and he was coming to Jesus Christ, being borne upon a bed by his friends: he also was coming himself, and that upon another account than any of his friends were aware of; even for the pardon of sins, and the salvation of his soul.","Now, so soon as ever he was come into the presence of Christ, Christ bids him ""be of good cheer.""","It seems then, his heart was fainting; but what was the cause of his fainting?","Not his bodily infirmity, for the cure of which his friends did bring him to Christ; but the guilt and burden of his sins, for the pardon of which himself did come to him; therefore he proceeds, ""Be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee.""","I say, Christ saw him sinking in his mind, about how it would go with his most noble part; and therefore, first, he applies himself to him upon that account.","For though his friends had faith enough as to the cure of the body, yet he himself had little enough as to the cure of his soul: therefore Christ takes him up as a man falling down, saying, ""Son, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee.""","That about the Prodigal seems pertinent also to this matter: ""When he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!","I will arise and go to my father.""",Heartily spoken; but how did he perform his promise?,"I think not so well as he promised to do; and my ground for my thoughts is, because his father, so soon as he was come to him, fell upon his neck and kissed him; implying, methinks, as if the prodigal by this time was dejected in his mind; and therefore his father gives him the most sudden and familiar token of reconciliation.",And kisses were of old time often used to remove doubts and fears.,Thus Laban and Esau kiss Jacob.,"Thus Joseph kissed his brethren; and thus also David kissed Absalom (Gen 31:55; 33:1-4; 48:9,10; 2 Sam 14:33).","It is true, as I said, at first setting out, he spake heartily, as sometimes sinners also do in their beginning to come to Jesus Christ; but might not he, yea, in all probability he had, between the first step he took, and the last, by which he accomplished that journey, many a thought, both this way and that; as whether his father would receive him or no?","As thus: I said, ""I would go to my Father.""","But how, if when I come at him he should ask me, Where I have all this while been?",What must I say then?,"Also, if he ask me, What is become of the portion of goods that he gave me?",What shall I say then?,"If he asks me, Who have been my companions?",What shall I say then?,"If he also shall ask me, What hath been my preferment in all the time of my absence from him?",What shall I say then?,"Yea, and if he ask me, Why I came home no sooner?",What shall I say then?,"Thus, I say, might he reason with himself, and being conscious to himself, that he could give but a bad answer to any of these interrogatories, no marvel if he stood in need first of all of a kiss from his father's lips.","For had he answered the first in truth, he must say, I have been a haunter of taverns and ale-houses; and as for my portion, I spent it in riotous living; my companions were whores and drabs; as for my preferment, the highest was, that I became a hog-herd; and as for my not coming home till now, could I have made shift to have staid abroad any longer, I had not lain at thy feet for mercy now.","I say, these things considered, and considering, again, how prone poor man is to give way, when truly awakened, to despondings and heart misgivings, no marvel if he did sink in his mind, between the time of his first setting out, and that of his coming to his Father.","Third, But, thirdly, methinks I have for the confirmation of this truth the consent of all the saints that are under heaven, to wit, That they that are coming to Jesus Christ, are ofttimes heartily afraid that he will not receive them.",Quest.,But what should be the reason?,I will answer to this question thus: 1.,"It is not for want of the revealed will of God, that manifesteth grounds for the contrary, for of that there is a sufficiency; yea, the text itself hath laid a sufficient foundation for encouragement, for them that are coming to Jesus Christ.","""And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""",2.,"It is not for want of any invitation to come, for that is full and plain.","""Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest"" (Matt 11:28).",3.,"Neither is it for want of a manifestation of Christ's willingness to receive, as those texts above named, with that which follows, declareth, ""If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink"" (John 7:37).",4.,It is not for want of exceeding great and precious promises to receive them that come.,"""Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty"" (2 Cor 6:17,18).",5.,It is not for want of solemn oath and engagement to save them that come.,"""For--because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself--that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us"" (Heb 6:13-18).",6.,"Neither is it for want of great examples of God's mercy, that have come to Jesus Christ, of which we read most plentifully in the Word.","Therefore, it must be concluded, it is for want of that which follows.",[What it is that prevents the coming to Christ.],"First, It is for want of the knowledge of Christ.","Thou knowest but little of the grace and kindness that is in the heart of Christ; thou knowest but little of the virtue and merit of his blood; thou knowest but little of the willingness that is in his heart to save thee; and this is the reason of the fear that ariseth in thy heart, and that causeth thee to doubt that Christ will not receive thee.",Unbelief is the daughter of Ignorance.,"Therefore Christ saith, ""O fools, and slow of heart to believe"" (Luke 24:25).","Slowness of heart to believe, flows from thy foolishness in the things of Christ; this is evident to all that are acquainted with themselves, and are seeking after Jesus Christ.","The more ignorance, the more unbelief.","The more knowledge of Christ, the more faith.","""They that know thy name will put their trust in thee"" (Psa 9:10).","He, therefore, that began to come to Christ but the other day, and hath yet but little knowledge of him, he fears that Christ will not receive him.","But he that hath been longer acquainted with him, he ""is strong, and hath overcome the wicked one"" (1 John 2:13).","When Joseph's brethren came into Egypt to buy corn, it is said, ""Joseph knew his brethren, but his brethren knew not him.""",What follows?,"Why, great mistrust of heart about their speeding well; especially, if Joseph did but answer them roughly, calling them spies, and questioning their truth and the like.","And observe it, so long as their ignorance about their brother remained with them, whatsoever Joseph did, still they put the worse sense upon it.","For instance, Joseph upon a time bids the steward of his house bring them home, to dine with him, to dine even in Joseph's house.",And how is this resented by them?,"Why, they are afraid.","""And the men were afraid, because they were brought unto"" their brother ""Joseph's house.""","And they said, He seeketh occasion against us, and will fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses (Gen 42, 43).",What!,afraid to go to Joseph's house?,"He was their brother; he intended to feast them; to feast them, and to feast with them.",Ah!,but they were ignorant that he was their brother.,"And so long as their ignorance lasted, so long their fear terrified them.",Just thus it is with the sinner that but of late is coming to Jesus Christ.,He is ignorant of the love and pity that is in Christ to coming sinners.,"Therefore he doubts, therefore he fears, therefore his heart misgives him.","Coming sinner, Christ inviteth thee to dine and sup with him.","He inviteth thee to a banquet of wine, yea, to come into his wine-cellar, and his banner over thee shall be love (Rev 3:20; Song 2:5).","But I doubt it, says the sinner: but, it is answered, he calls thee, invites thee to his banquet, flagons, apples; to his wine, and to the juice of his pomegranate.","""O, I fear, I doubt, I mistrust, I tremble in expectation of the contrary!""","Come out of the man, thou dastardly ignorance!","Be not afraid, sinner, only believe; ""He that cometh to Christ he will in no wise cast out.""","Let the coming sinner, therefore, seek after more of the good knowledge of Jesus Christ.","Press after it, seek it as silver, and dig for it as for hid treasure.",This will embolden thee; this will make thee wax stronger and stronger.,"""I know whom I have believed,"" I know him, said Paul; and what follows?","Why, ""and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him, against that day"" (2 Tim 1:12).",What had Paul committed to Jesus Christ?,"The answer is, He had committed to him his soul.",But why did he commit his soul to him?,"Why, because he knew him.","He knew him to be faithful, to be kind.","He knew he would not fail him, nor forsake him; and therefore he laid his soul down at his feet, and committed it to him, to keep against that day.","But, Second, Thy fears that Christ will not receive thee may be also a consequent of thy earnest and strong desires after thy salvation by him.","For this I observe, that strong desires to have, are attended with strong fears of missing.","What man most sets his heart upon, and what his desires are most after, he ofttimes most fears he shall not obtain.","So the man, the ruler of the synagogue, had a great desire that his daughter should live; and that desire was attended with fear, that she should not.","Wherefore, Christ saith unto him, ""Be not afraid"" (Mark 5:36).","Suppose a young man should have his heart much set upon a virgin to have her to wife, if ever he fears he shall not obtain her, it is when he begins to love; now, thinks he, somebody will step in betwixt my love and the object of it; either they will find fault with my person, my estate, my conditions, or something!","Now thoughts begin to work; she doth not like me, or something.","And thus it is with the soul at first coming to Jesus Christ, thou lovest him, and thy love produceth jealousy, and that jealousy ofttimes begets fears.","Now thou fearest the sins of thy youth, the sins of thine old age, the sins of thy calling, the sins of thy Christian duties, the sins of thine heart, or something; thou thinkest something or other will alienate the heart and affections of Jesus Christ from thee; thou thinkest he sees something in thee, for the sake of which he will refuse thy soul.","But be content, a little more knowledge of him will make thee take better heart; thy earnest desires shall not be attended with such burning fears; thou shalt hereafter say, ""This is my infirmity"" (Psa 77:10).","Thou art sick of love, a very sweet disease, and yet every disease has some weakness attending of it: yet I wish this distemper, if it be lawful to call it so, was more epidemical.","Die of this disease I would gladly do; it is better than life itself, though it be attended with fears.","But thou criest, I cannot obtain: well, be not too hasty in making conclusions.","If Jesus Christ had not put his finger in at the hole of the lock, thy bowels would not have been troubled for him (Song 5:4).","Mark how the prophet hath it, ""They shall walk after the Lord; he shall roar like a lion; when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west, they shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria"" (Hosea 11:10,11).","When God roars (as ofttimes the coming soul hears him roar), what man that is coming can do otherwise than tremble?",(Amos 3:8).,"But trembling he comes: ""He sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas"" (Acts 16:29).","Should you ask him that we mentioned but now, How long is it since you began to fear you should miss of this damsel you love so?","The answer will be, Ever since I began to love her.",But did you not fear it before?,"No, nor should I fear it now, but that I vehemently love her.","Come, sinner, let us apply it: How long is it since thou began to fear that Jesus Christ will not receive thee?","Thy answer is, Ever since I began to desire that he would save my soul.","I began to fear, when I began to come; and the more my heart burns in desires after him, the more I feel my heart fear I shall not be saved by him.","See now, did not I tell thee that thy fears were but the consequence of strong desires?","Well, fear not, coming sinner, thousands of coming souls are in thy condition, and yet they will get safe into Christ's bosom: ""Say,"" says Christ, ""to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not; your God will come and save you"" (Isa 35:4; 63:1).","Third, Thy fear that Christ will not receive thee may arise from a sense of thine own unworthiness.","Thou seest what a poor, sorry, wretched, worthless creature thou art; and seeing this, thou fearest Christ will not receive thee.","Alas, sayest thou, I am the vilest of all men; a town-sinner, a ringleading sinner!","I am not only a sinner myself, but have made others twofold worse the children of hell also.","Besides, now I am under some awakenings and stirrings of mind after salvation, even now I find my heart rebellious, carnal, hard, treacherous, desperate, prone to unbelief, to despair: it forgetteth the Word; it wandereth; it runneth to the ends of the earth.","There is not, I am persuaded, one in all the world that hath such a desperate wicked heart as mine is; my soul is careless to do good, but none more earnest to do that which is evil.","Can such a one as I am, live in glory?","Can a holy, a just, and a righteous God, once think (with honour to his name) of saving such a vile creature as I am?",I fear it.,Will he show wonders to such a dead dog as I am?,I doubt it.,"I am cast out to the loathing of my person, yea, I loath myself; I stink in mine own nostrils.",How can I then be accepted by a holy and sin-abhorring God?,"(Psa 38:5-7; Eze 11; 20:42,44).","Saved I would be; and who is there that would not, were they in my condition?","Indeed, I wonder at the madness and folly of others, when I see them leap and skip so carelessly about the mouth of hell!","Bold sinner, how darest thou tempt God, by laughing at the breach of his holy law?",But alas!,"they are not so bad one way, but I am worse another: I wish myself were anybody but myself; and yet here again, I know not what to wish.","When I see such as I believe are coming to Jesus Christ, O I bless them!","But I am confounded in myself, to see how unlike, as I think, I am to every good man in the world.","They can read, hear, pray, remember, repent, be humble, do everything better than so vile a wretch as I. I, vile wretch, am good for nothing but to burn in hell-fire, and when I think of that, I am confounded too!",Thus the sense of unworthiness creates and heightens fears in the hearts of them that are coming to Jesus Christ; but indeed it should not; for who needs the physician but the sick?,"or who did Christ come into the world to save, but the chief of sinners?",(Mark 2:17; 1 Tim 1:15).,"Wherefore, the more thou seest thy sins, the faster fly thou to Jesus Christ.",And let the sense of thine own unworthiness prevail with thee yet to go faster.,"As it is with the man that carrieth his broken arm in a sling to the bone-setter, still as he thinks of his broken arm, and as he feels the pain and anguish, he hastens his pace to the man.","And if Satan meets thee, and asketh, Whither goest thou?","tell him thou art maimed, and art going to the Lord Jesus.","If he objects thine own unworthiness, tell him, That even as the sick seeketh the physician; as he that hath broken bones seeks him that can set them; so thou art going to Jesus Christ for cure and healing for thy sin sick soul.","But it ofttimes happeneth to him that flies for his life, he despairs of escaping, and therefore delivers himself up into the hand of the pursuer.","But up, up, sinner; be of good cheer, Christ came to save the unworthy ones: be not faithless, but believe.","Come away, man, the Lord Jesus calls thee, saying, ""And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""",Fourth.,"Thy fear that Christ will not receive thee, may arise from a sense of the exceeding mercy of being saved; sometimes salvation is in the eyes of him that desires so great, so huge, so wonderful a thing, that the very thoughts of the excellency of it, engenders unbelief about obtaining it, in the heart of those that unfeignedly desire it.","""Seemeth it to you,"" saith David, ""a light thing to be a king's son-in-law?""",(1 Sam 18:23).,"So the thoughts of the greatness and glory of the thing propounded, as heaven, eternal life, eternal glory, to be with God, and Christ, and angels; these are great things, things too good, saith the soul that is little in his own eyes; things too rich, saith the soul that is truly poor in spirit, for me.","Besides, the Holy Ghost hath a way to greaten heavenly things to the understanding of the coming sinner; yea, and at the same time to greaten, too, the sin and unworthiness of that sinner.","Now the soul staggeringly wonders, saying, What!","to be made like angels, like Christ, to live in eternal bliss, joy, and felicity!","This is for angels, and for them that can walk like angels!","If a prince, a duke, an earl, should send (by the hand of his servant) for some poor, sorry, beggarly scrub, to take her for his master to wife, and the servant should come and say, My lord and master, such an one hath sent me to thee, to take thee to him to wife; he is rich, beautiful, and of excellent qualities; he is loving, meek, humble, well-spoken, &c. What now would this poor, sorry, beggarly creature think?",What would she say?,or how would she frame an answer?,"When king David sent to Abigail upon this account, and though she was a rich woman, yet she said, ""Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord"" (1 Sam 25:40,41).","She was confounded, she could not well tell what to say, the offer was so great, beyond what could in reason be expected.","But suppose this great person should second his suit, and send to this sorry creature again, what would she say now?","Would she not say, You mock me?","But what if he affirms that he is in good earnest, and that his lord must have her to wife; yea, suppose he should prevail upon her to credit his message, and to address herself for her journey; yet, behold every thought of her pedigree confounds her; also her sense of want of beauty makes her ashamed; and if she doth but think of being embraced, the unbelief that is mixed with that thought whirls her into tremblings; and now she calls herself fool, for believing the messenger, and thinks not to go; if she thinks of being bold, she blushes; and the least thought that she shall be rejected, when she comes at him, makes her look as if she would give up the ghost.","And is it a wonder, then, to see a soul that is drowned in the sense of glory and a sense of its own nothingness, to be confounded in itself, and to fear that the glory apprehended is too great, too good, and too rich, for such an one?","That thing, heaven and eternal glory, is so great, and I that would have it, so small, so sorry a creature, that the thoughts of obtaining it confounds me.","Thus, I say, doth the greatness of the things desired, quite dash and overthrow the mind of the desirer.","O, it is too big!",it is too big!,it is too great a mercy!,"But, coming sinner, let me reason with thee.","Thou sayest, it is too big, too great.","Well, will things that are less satisfy thy soul?","Will a less thing than heaven, than glory and eternal life, answer thy desires?","No, nothing less; and yet I fear they are too big, and too good for me, ever to obtain.","Well, as big and as good as they are, God giveth them to such as thou; they are not too big for God to give; no, not too big to give freely.","Be content; let God give like himself; he is that eternal God, and giveth like himself.","When kings give, they do not use to give as poor men do.","Hence it is said, that Nabal made a feast in his house like the feast of a king; and again, ""All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto David"" (1 Sam 25:36; 2 Sam 24:23).","Now, God is a great king, let him give like a king; nay, let him give like himself, and do thou receive like thyself.","He hath all, and thou hast nothing.","God told his people of old, that he would save them in truth and in righteousness, and that they should return to, and enjoy the land, which before, for their sins, had spewed them out; and then adds, under a supposition of their counting the mercy too good, or too big, ""If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes?","saith the Lord of hosts"" (Zech 8:6).","As who should say, they are now in captivity, and little in their own eyes; therefore they think the mercy of returning to Canaan is a mercy too marvellously big for them to enjoy; but if it be so in their eyes, it is not so in mine; I will do for them like God, if they will but receive my bounty like sinners.","Coming sinner, God can give his heavenly Canaan, and the glory of it, unto thee; yea, none ever had them but as a gift, a free gift.","He hath given us his Son, ""How shall he not with him also freely give us all things?""",(Rom 8:32).,"It was not the worthiness of Abraham, or Moses, or David or Peter, or Paul, but the mercy of God, that made them inheritors of heaven.","If God thinks thee worthy, judge not thyself unworthy; but take it, and be thankful.","And it is a good sign he intends to give thee, if he hath drawn out thy heart to ask.","""Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble; thou wilt prepare their heart; thou wilt cause thine ear to hear"" (Psa 10:17).","When God is said to incline his ear, it implies an intention to bestow the mercy desired.","Take it therefore; thy wisdom will be to receive, not sticking at thy own unworthiness.","It is said, ""He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory.""","Again, ""He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill, that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people"" (1 Sam 2:8; Psa 113:7,8).","You see also when God made a wedding for his Son, he called not the great, nor the rich, nor the mighty; but the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind (Matt 12; Luke 14).",Fifth.,"Thy fears that Christ will not receive thee may arise from the hideous roaring of the devil, who pursues thee.","He that hears him roar, must be a mighty Christian, if he can at that time deliver himself from fear.","He is called a roaring lion; and then to allude to that in Isaiah, ""If one look"" into them, they have ""darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof"" (1 Peter 5:8; Isa 5:3).",[Two of the devil's objections.],--There are two things among many that Satan useth to roar out after them that are coming to Jesus Christ.,1.,That they are not elected.,"Or, 2.",That they have sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost.,To both these I answer briefly-- 1.,[Election.],"--Touching election, out of which thou fearest thou art excluded.","Why, coming sinner, even the text itself affordeth thee help against this doubt, and that by a double argument.",(1.),"That coming to Christ is by virtue of the gift, promise, and drawing of the Father; but thou art a-coming; therefore God hath given thee, promised thee, and is drawing thee to Jesus Christ.","Coming sinner, hold to this; and when Satan beginneth to roar again, answer, But I feel my heart moving after Jesus Christ; but that would not be, if it were not given by promise, and drawing to Christ by the power of the Father.",(2.),"Jesus Christ hath promised, ""That him that cometh to him he will in no wise cast out.""","And if he hath said it, will he not make it good, I mean even thy salvation?","For, as I have said already, not to cast out, is to receive and admit to the benefit of salvation.","If then the Father hath given thee, as is manifest by thy coming; and if Christ will receive thee, thou coming soul, as it is plain he will, because he hath said, ""He will in no wise cast out;"" then be confident, and let those conclusions, that as naturally flow from the text as light from the sun, or water from the fountain, stay thee.","If Satan therefore objecteth, But thou art not elected; answer, But I am coming, Satan, I am coming; and that I could not be, but that the Father draws me; and I am coming to such a Lord Jesus, as will in no wise cast me out.","Further, Satan, were I not elect, the Father would not draw me, nor would the Son so graciously open his bosom to me.","I am persuaded, that not one of the nonelect shall ever be able to say, no, not in the day of judgment, I did sincerely come to Jesus Christ.","Come they may, feignedly, as Judas and Simon Magus did; but that is not our question.","Therefore, O thou honest-hearted coming sinner, be not afraid, but come.",2.,[Of the sin against the Holy Ghost.],"--As to the second part of the objection, about sinning the sin against the Holy Ghost, the same argument overthrows that also.",But I will argue thus: (1.),Coming to Christ is by virtue of a special gift of the Father; but the Father giveth no such gift to them that have sinned that sin; therefore thou that art coming hast not committed that sin.,That the Father giveth no such gift to them that have sinned that sin is evident--(a.),"Because such have sinned themselves out of God's favour; ""They shall never have forgiveness"" (Matt 12:32).","But it is a special favour of God to give unto a man, to come to Jesus Christ; because thereby he obtaineth forgiveness.",Therefore he that cometh hath not sinned that sin.,(b.),"They that have sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost, have sinned themselves out of an interest in the sacrifice of Christ's body and blood; ""There remaineth [for such] no more sacrifice for sins"" (Heb 10:26).","But God giveth not grace to any of them to come to Christ, that have no share in the sacrifice of his body and blood.","Therefore, thou that art coming to him, hast not sinned that sin.",(2.),"Coming to Christ is by the special drawing of the Father; ""No man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him"" (John 6:44).","But the Father draweth not him to Christ, for whom he hath not allotted forgiveness by his blood; therefore they that are coming to Jesus Christ have not committed that sin, because he hath allotted them forgiveness by his blood.","That the Father cannot draw them to Jesus Christ, for whom he hath not allotted forgiveness of sins, is manifest to sense: for that would be a plain mockery, a flam, 17 neither becoming his wisdom, justice, holiness, nor goodness.",(3.),Coming to Jesus Christ lays a man under the promise of forgiveness and salvation.,But it is impossible that he that hath sinned that sin should ever be put under a promise of these.,"Therefore, he that hath sinned that sin can never have heart to come to Jesus Christ.",(4.),Coming to Jesus Christ lays a man under his intercession.,"""For he ever liveth to make intercession for them that come"" (Heb 7:25).","Therefore, he that is coming to Jesus Christ cannot have sinned that sin.","Christ has forbidden his people to pray for them that have sinned that sin; and, therefore, will not pray for them himself, but he prays for them that come.",(5.),"He that hath sinned that sin, Christ is to him of no more worth than is a man that is dead; ""For he hath crucified to himself the Son of God;"" yea, and hath also counted his precious blood as the blood of an unholy thing.","(Heb 6, 10) Now, he that hath this low esteem of Christ will never come to him for life; but the coming man has an high esteem of his person, blood, and merits.","Therefore, he that is coming has not committed that sin.",(6.),"If he that has sinned this sin might yet come to Jesus Christ, then must the truth of God be overthrown; which saith in one place, ""He hath never forgiveness;"" and in another, ""I will in no wise cast him out.""","Therefore, that he may never have forgiveness, he shall never have heart to come to Jesus Christ.","It is impossible that such an one should be renewed, either to or by repentance (Heb 6).","Wherefore, never trouble thy head nor heart about this matter; he that cometh to Jesus Christ cannot have sinned against the Holy Ghost.","Sixth, Thy fears that Christ will not receive thee may arise from thine own folly, in inventing, yea, in thy chalking out to God, a way to bring thee home to Jesus Christ.","Some souls that are coming to Jesus Christ are great tormentors of themselves upon this account; they conclude, that if their coming to Jesus Christ is right, they must needs be brought home thus and thus.",As to instance: 1.,"Says one, If God be bringing of me to Jesus Christ, then will he load me with the guilt of sin till he makes me roar again.",2.,"If God be indeed a-bringing me home to Jesus Christ, then must I be assaulted with dreadful temptations of the devil.",3.,"If God be indeed a-bringing me to Jesus Christ, then, even when I come at him, I shall have wonderful revelations of him.","This is the way that some sinners appoint for God; but, perhaps, he will not walk therein; yet will he bring them to Jesus Christ.","But now, because they come not the way of their own chalking out, therefore they are at a loss.","They look for heavy load and burden; but, perhaps, God gives them a sight of their lost condition, and addeth not that heavy weight and burden.","They look for fearful temptations of Satan; but God sees that yet they are not fit for them, nor is the time come that he should be honoured by them in such a condition.","They look for great and glorious revelations of Christ, grace, and mercy; but, perhaps, God only takes the yoke from off their jaws, and lays meat before them.","And now again they are at a loss, yet a-coming to Jesus Christ; ""I drew them,"" saith God, ""with cords of a man, with bands of love--I took the yoke from off their jaws, and laid meat unto them"" (Hosea 11:4).","Now, I say, If God brings thee to Christ, and not by the way that thou hast appointed, then thou art at a loss; and for thy being at a loss, thou mayest thank thyself.",God hath more ways than thou knowest of to bring a sinner to Jesus Christ; but he will not give thee beforehand an account by which of them he will bring thee to Christ (Isa 40:13; Job 33:13).,Sometimes he hath his ways in the whirlwind; but sometimes the Lord is not there (Nahum 1:3; 1 Kings 19:11).,"If God will deal more gently with thee than with others of his children, grudge not at it; refuse not the waters that go softly, lest he bring upon thee the waters of the rivers, strong and many, even these two smoking firebrand, the devil and guilt of sin (Isa 8:6,7).","He saith to Peter, ""Follow me.""",And what thunder did Zaccheus hear or see?,"Zaccheus, ""Come down,"" said Christ; ""and he came down,"" says Luke, ""and received him joyfully.""","But had Peter or Zaccheus made the objection that thou hast made, and directed the Spirit of the Lord as thou hast done, they might have looked long enough before they had found themselves coming to Jesus Christ.","Besides, I will tell thee, that the greatness of sense of sin, the hideous roaring of the devil, yea, and abundance of revelations, will not prove that God is bringing thy soul to Jesus Christ; as Balaam, Cain, Judas, and others, can witness.","Further, consider that what thou hast not of these things here, thou mayest have another time, and that to thy distraction.","Wherefore, instead of being discontent, because thou art not in the fire, because thou hearest not the sound of the trumpet and alarm of war, ""Pray that thou enter not into temptation;"" yea, come boldly to the throne of grace, and obtain mercy, and find grace to help in that time of need (Psa 88:15; Matt 26:41; Heb 4:16).",Poor creature!,"thou criest, if I were tempted, I could come faster and with more confidence to Christ.",Thou sayest thou knowest not what.,What says Job?,"""Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.","Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me"" (Job 13:21,22).","It is not the overheavy load of sin, but the discovery of mercy; not the roaring of the devil, but the drawing of the Father, that makes a man come to Jesus Christ; I myself know all these things.","True, sometimes, yea, most an end, 18 they that come to Jesus Christ come the way that thou desirest; the loading, tempted way; but the Lord also leads some by the waters of comfort.","If I was to choose when to go a long journey, to wit, whether I would go it in the dead of winter or in the pleasant spring, though, if it was a very profitable journey, as that of coming to Christ is, I would choose to go it through fire and water before I would choose lose the benefit.","But, I say, if I might choose the time, I would choose to go it in the pleasant spring, because the way would be more delightsome, the days longer and warmer, the nights shorter and not so cold.","And it is observable, that that very argument that thou usest to weaken thy strength in the way, that very argument Christ Jesus useth to encourage his beloved to come to him: ""Rise up,"" saith he, ""my love, my fair one, and come away.""",Why?,"""For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; the fig-tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell.","Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away"" (Song 2:10-13).","Trouble not thyself, coming sinner.","If thou seest thy lost condition by original and actual sin; if thou seest thy need of the spotless righteousness of Jesus Christ; if thou art willing to be found in him, and to take up thy cross and follow him; then pray for a fair wind and good weather, and come away.","Stick no longer in a muse and doubt about things, but come away to Jesus Christ.","Do it, I say, lest thou tempt God to lay the sorrows of a travailing woman upon thee.",Thy folly in this thing may make him do it.,"Mind what follows: ""The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him.""",Why?,"""He is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children"" (Hosea 13:13).","Seventh, Thy fears that Christ will not receive thee may arise from those decays that thou findest in thy soul, even while thou art coming to him.","Some, even as they are coming to Jesus Christ, do find themselves grow worse and worse; and this is indeed a sore trial to the poor coming sinner.",[Fears that we do not run fast enough.],To explain myself.,"There is such an one a coming to Jesus Christ who, when at first he began to look out after him, was sensible, affectionate, and broken in spirit; but now is grown dark, senseless, hard-hearted, and inclining to neglect spiritual duties, &c. Besides, he now finds in himself inclinations to unbelief, atheism, blasphemy, and the like; now he finds he cannot tremble at God's Word, his judgment, nor at the apprehension of hell fire; neither can he, as he thinketh, be sorry for these things.","Now, this is a sad dispensation.","The man under the sixth head complaineth for want of temptations, but thou hast enough of them; art thou glad of them, tempted, coming sinner?","They that never were exercised with them may think it a fine thing to be within the range, but he that is there is ready to sweat blood for sorrow of heart, and to howl for vexation of spirit!",This man is in the wilderness among wild beasts.,"Here he sees a bear, there a lion, yonder a leopard, a wolf, a dragon; devils of all sorts, doubts of all sorts, fears of all sorts, haunt and molest his soul.","Here he sees smoke, yea, feels fire and brimstone, scattered upon his secret places.",He hears the sound of an horrible tempest.,O!,"my friends, even the Lord Jesus, that knew all things, even he saw no pleasure in temptations, nor did he desire to be with them; wherefore, one text saith, ""he was led,"" and another, ""he was driven,"" of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil (Matt 4:1; Mark 1:12).",But to return.,Thus it happeneth sometimes to them that are coming to Jesus Christ.,A sad hap indeed!,One would think that he that is flying from wrath to come has little need of such clogs as these.,"And yet so it is, and woeful experience proves it.","The church of old complained that her enemies overtook her between the straits; just between hope and fear, heaven and hell (Lam 1).","This man feeleth the infirmity of his flesh, he findeth a proneness in himself to be desperate.","Now, he chides with God, flings and tumbles like a wild bull in a net, and still the guilt of all returns upon himself, to the crushing of him to pieces.","Yet he feeleth his heart so hard, that he can find, as he thinks, no kind falling under any of his miscarriages.","Now, he is a lump of confusion in his own eyes, whose spirit and actions are without order.","Temptations serve the Christian as the shepherd's dog serveth the silly sheep; that is, coming behind the flock, he runs upon it, pulls it down, worries it, wounds it, and grievously bedabbleth it with dirt and wet, in the lowest places of the furrows of the field, and not leaving it until it is half dead, nor then neither, except God rebuke.",Here is now room for fears of being cast away.,"Now I see I am lost, says the sinner.","This is not coming to Jesus Christ, says the sinner; such a desperate, hard, and wretched heart as mine is, cannot be a gracious one, saith the sinner.","And bid such an one be better, he says, I cannot; no, I cannot.",[Why temptations assail God's people.],Quest.,But what will you say to a soul in this condition?,Answ.,"I will say, That temptations have attended the best of God's people.","I will say, That temptations come to do us good; and I will say also, That there is a difference betwixt growing worse and worse, and thy seeing more clearly how bad thou art.","There is a man of an ill-favoured countenance, who hath too high a conceit of his beauty; and, wanting the benefit of a glass, he still stands in his own conceit; at last a limner is sent unto him, who draweth his ill-favoured face to the life; now looking thereon, he begins to be convinced that he is not half so handsome as he thought he was.","Coming sinner, thy temptations are these painters; they have drawn out thy ill-favoured heart to the life, and have set it before thine eyes, and now thou seest how ill-favoured thou art.","Hezekiah was a good man, yet when he lay sick, for aught I know, he had somewhat too good an opinion of his heart; and for aught I know also, the Lord might, upon his recovery, leave him to a temptation, that he might better know all that was in his heart.","Compare Isaiah 38:1-3, with 2 Chronicles 32:31.",Alas!,"we are sinful out of measure, but see it not to be the full, until an hour of temptation comes.","But when it comes, it doth as the painter doth, draweth out our heart to the life: yet the sight of what we are should not keep us from coming to Jesus Christ.","There are two ways by which God lets a man into a sight of the naughtiness of his heart; one is, by the light of the Word and Spirit of God; and the other is, by the temptations of the devil.","But, by the first, we see our naughtiness one way; and, by the second, another.","By the light of the Word and Spirit of God, thou hast a sight of thy naughtiness; and by the light of the sun, thou hast a sight of the spots and defilements that are in thy house or raiment.","Which light gives thee to see a necessity of cleansing, but maketh not the blemishes to spread more abominably.","But when Satan comes, when he tempts, he puts life and rage into our sins, and turns them, as it were, into so many devils within us.","Now, like prisoners, they attempt to break through the prison of our body; they will attempt to get out at our eyes, mouth, ears, any ways, to the scandal of the gospel, and reproach of religion, to the darkening of our evidences, and damning of our souls.","But I shall say, as I said before, this hath ofttimes been the lot of God's people.","And, ""There hath no temptation overtaken you but such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able"" (1 Cor 10:13).","See the Book of Job, the Book of Psalms, and that of the Lamentations.","And remember further, that Christ himself was tempted to blaspheme, to worship the devil, and to murder himself, (Matt 4; Luke 4); temptations worse than which thou canst hardly be overtaken with.","But he was sinless, that is true.","And he is thy Saviour, and that is as true!","Yea, it is as true also, that by his being tempted, he became the conqueror of the tempter, and a succourer of those that are tempted (Col 2:14,15; Heb 2:15; 4:15,16).",Quest.,But what should be the reason that some that are coming to Christ should be so lamentably cast down and buffeted with temptations?,Answ.,It may be for several causes.,1.,"Some that are coming to Christ cannot be persuaded, until the temptation comes, that they are so vile as the Scripture saith they are.","True, they see so much of their wretchedness as to drive them to Christ.",But there is an over and above of wickedness which they see not.,"Peter little thought that he had had cursing, and swearing, and lying, and an inclination in his heart to deny his Master, before the temptation came; but when that indeed came upon him, then he found it there to his sorrow (John 13:36-38; Mark 14:36-40; 68-72).",2.,"Some that are coming to Jesus Christ are too much affected with their own graces, and too little taken with Christ's person; wherefore God, to take them off from doting upon their own jewels, and that they might look more to the person, undertaking, and merits of his Son, plunges them into the ditch by temptations.","And this I take to be the meaning of Job, ""If I wash myself,"" said he, ""with snow-water, and make my hands never so clean, yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me"" (Job 9:30).","Job had been a little too much tampering with his own graces, and setting his excellencies a little too high; as these texts make manifest: Job 33:8-13, 34:5-10, 35:2,3, 38:1,2, 40:105, 42:3-6.","But by that the temptations were ended, you find him better taught.","Yea, God doth ofttimes, even for this thing, as it were, take our graces from us, and so leave us almost quite to ourselves and to the tempter, that we may learn not to love the picture more than the person of his Son.","See how he dealt with them in the 16th of Ezekiel, and the second of Hosea.",3.,"Perhaps thou hast been given too much to judge thy brother, to condemn thy brother, because a poor tempted man.","And God, to bring down the pride of thy heart, letteth the tempter loose upon thee, that thou also mayst feel thyself weak.","For ""pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall"" (Prov 16:18).",4.,"It may be thou hast dealt a little too roughly with those that God hath this way wounded, not considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.",And therefore God hath suffered it to come unto thee (Gal 6:1).,5.,"It may be thou wast given to slumber and sleep, and therefore these temptations were sent to awake thee.","You know that Peter's temptation came upon him after his sleeping; then, instead of watching and praying, then he denied, and denied, and denied his Master (Matt 26).",6.,"It may be thou hast presumed too far, and stood too much in thine own strength, and therefore is a time of temptation come upon thee.","This was also one cause why it came upon Peter--Though all men forsake thee, yet will not I. Ah!",that is the way to be tempted indeed (John 13:36-38).,7.,"It may be God intends to make thee wise, to speak a word in season to others that are afflicted; and therefore he suffereth thee to be tempted.",Christ was tempted that he might be able to succour them that are tempted (Heb 2:18).,8.,"It may be Satan hath dared God to suffer him to tempt thee; promising himself, that if he will but let him do it, thou wilt curse him to his face.","Thus he obtained leave against Job; wherefore take heed, tempted soul, lest thou provest the devil's sayings true (Job 1:11).",9.,"It may be thy graces must be tried in the fire, that that rust that cleaveth to them may be taken away, and themselves proved, both before angels and devils, to be far better than of gold that perisheth; it may be also, that thy graces are to receive special praises, and honour, and glory, at the coming of the Lord Jesus to judgment, for all the exploits that thou hast acted by them against hell, and its infernal crew, in the day of thy temptation (1 Peter 1:6,7).",10.,"It may be God would have others learn by thy sighs, groans, and complaints, under temptation, to beware of those sins for the sake of which thou art at present delivered to the tormentors.","But to conclude this, put the worst to the worst--and then things will be bad enough--suppose that thou art to this day without the grace of God, yet thou art but a miserable creature, a sinner, that hath need of a blessed Saviour; and the text presents thee with one as good and kind as heart can wish; who also for thy encouragement saith, ""And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""",[Application of Observation Second.],"To come, therefore, to a word of application.","Is it so, that they that are coming to Jesus Christ are ofttimes heartily afraid that Jesus Christ will not receive them?",Then this teacheth us these things-- 1.,That faith and doubting may at the same time have their residence in the same soul.,"""O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?""",(Matt 14:31).,"He saith not, O thou of no faith!","but, O thou of little faith!",because he had a little faith in the midst of his many doubts.,The same is true even of many that are coming to Jesus Christ.,"They come, and fear they come not, and doubt they come not.","When they look upon the promise, or a word of encouragement by faith, then they come; but when they look upon themselves, or the difficulties that lie before them, then they doubt.","""Bid me come,"" said Peter; ""Come,"" said Christ.","So he went down out of the ship to go to Jesus, but his hap was to go to him upon the water; there was the trial.",So it is with the poor desiring soul.,"Bid me come, says the sinner; Come, says Christ, and I will in no wise cast thee out.","So he comes, but his hap is to come upon the water, upon drowning difficulties; if, therefore, the wind of temptations blow, the waves of doubts and fears will presently arise, and this coming sinner will begin to sink, if he has but little faith.","But you shall find here in Peter's little faith, a twofold act; to wit, coming and crying.",Little faith cannot come all the way without crying.,"So long as its holy boldness lasts, so long it can come with peace; but when it is so, it can come no further, it will go the rest of the way with crying.","Peter went as far as his little faith would carry him: he also cried as far as his little faith would help, ""Lord, save me, I perish!""","And so with coming and crying he was kept from sinking, though he had but a little faith.","""Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?""",2.,"Is it so, that they that are coming to Jesus Christ are ofttimes heartily afraid that Jesus Christ will not receive them?","Then this shows us a reason of that dejection, and those castings down, that very often we perceive to be in them that are coming to Jesus Christ.","Why, it is because they are afraid that Jesus Christ will not receive them.","The poor world they mock us, because we are a dejected people; I mean, because we are sometimes so: but they do not know the cause of our dejection.","Could we be persuaded, even then, when we are dejected, that Jesus Christ would indeed receive us, it would make us fly over their heads, and would put more gladness into our hearts than in the time in which their corn, wine, and oil increases (Psa 4:6,7).","But, 3.","It is so, That they that are coming to Jesus Christ are ofttimes heartily afraid that he will not receive them.","Then this shows that they that are coming to Jesus Christ are an awakened, sensible, considering people.","For fear cometh from sense, and consideration of things.","They are sensible of sin, sensible of the curse due thereto;

to wit, That Jesus Christ would not have them, that in truth are coming to him, once think that he will cast them out.","The text is full of this: for he saith, ""And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""","Now, if he saith, I will not, he would not have us think he will.",This is yet further manifest by these considerations.,"First, Christ Jesus did forbid even them that as yet were not coming to him, once to think him such an one.","""Do not think,"" said he, ""that I will accuse you to the Father"" (John 5:45).","These, as I said, were such, that as yet were not coming to him.","For he saith of them a little before, ""And ye will not come to me;"" for the respect they had to the honour of men kept them back.","Yet, I say, Jesus Christ gives them to understand, that though he might justly reject them, yet he would not, but bids them not once to think that he would accuse them to the Father.","Now, not to accuse, with Christ, is to plead for: for Christ in these things stands not neuter between the Father and sinners.","So then, if Jesus Christ would not have them think, that yet will not come to him, that he will accuse them; then he would not that they should think so, that in truth are coming to him.","""And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""","Second, When the woman taken in adultery, even in the very act, was brought before Jesus Christ, he so carried it both by words and actions, that he evidently enough made it manifest, that condemning and casting out were such things, for the doing of which he came not into the world.","Wherefore, when they had set her before him, and had laid to her charge her heinous fact, he stooped down, and with his finger wrote upon the ground, as though he heard them not.","Now what did he do by this his carriage, but testify plainly that he was not for receiving accusations against poor sinners, whoever accused by?","And observe, though they continue asking, thinking at last to force him to condemn her; yet then he so answered, so that he drove all condemning persons from her.","And then he adds, for her encouragement to come to him; ""Neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more"" (John 8:1-11).","Not but that he indeed abhorred the fact, but he would not condemn the woman for the sin, because that was not his office.","He was not sent ""into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved"" (John 3:17).","Now if Christ, though urged to it, would not condemn the guilty woman, though she was far at present from coming to him, he would not that they should once think that he will cast them out, that in truth are coming to him.","""And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""","Third, Christ plainly bids the turning sinner come;

Who may have it?,3.,Upon what terms?,1.,What life is in Jesus Christ?,[Answ.],(1.),There is justifying life in Christ.,Man by sin is dead in law; and Christ only can deliver him by his righteousness and blood from this death into a state of life.,"""For God sent his Son into the world, that we might live through him"" (1 John 4:9).","That is, through the righteousness which he should accomplish, and the death that he should die.",(2.),There is eternal life in Christ; life that is endless; life for ever and ever.,"""He hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son"" (1 John 5:11).","Now, justification and eternal salvation being both in Christ, and nowhere else to be had for men, who would not come to Jesus Christ?",2. Who may have this life?,"I answer, Poor, helpless, miserable sinners.","Particularly, (1.)",Such as are willing to have it.,"""Whosoever will, let him take the water of life"" (Rev 22:17).",(2.),He that thirsteth for it.,"""I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life"" (Rev 21:6).",(3.),He that is weary of his sins.,"""This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing"" (Isa 28:12).",(4.),He that is poor and needy.,"""He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy"" (Psa 72:13).",(5.),"He that followeth after him, crieth for life.","""He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life"" (John 8:12).",3.,Upon what terms may he have this life?,[Answ.],Freely.,"Sinner, dost thou hear.",Thou mayest have it freely.,Let him take the water of life freely.,I will give him of the fountain of the water of life freely.,"""And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both"" (Luke 7:42).","Freely, without money, or without price.","""Ho!","every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price"" (Isa 55:1).","Sinner, art thou thirsty?",art thou weary?,art thou willing?,"Come, then, and regard not your stuff; for all the good that is in Christ is offered to the coming sinner, without money and without price.","He has life to give away to such as want it, and that hath not a penny to purchase it; and he will give it freely.",Oh what a blessed condition is the coming sinner in!,"But, Third, This doctrine of coming to Jesus Christ for life, informeth us, that it is to be had nowhere else.","Might it be had anywhere else, the text, and him that spoke it, would be but little set by; for what greater matter is there in ""I will in no wise cast out,"" if another stood by that could receive them?","But here appears the glory of Christ, that none but he can save.","And here appears his love, that though none can save but he, yet he is not coy in saving.","""But him that comes to me,"" says he, ""I will in no wise cast out.""","That none can save but Jesus Christ, is evident from Acts 4:12: ""Neither is there salvation in any other;"" and ""he hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son"" (1 John 5:11).","If life could have been had anywhere else, it should have been in the law.","But it is not in the law; for by the deeds of the law, no man living shall be justified; and if not justified, then no life.",Therefore life is nowhere to be had but in Jesus Christ (Gal 3).,[Quest.],"But why would God so order it, that life should be had nowhere else but in Jesus Christ?",[Answ.],"There is reason for it, and that both with respect to God and us.",1.,With respect to God.,(1.),That it might be in a way of justice as well as mercy.,"And in a way of justice it could not have been, if it had not been by Christ; because he, and he only, was able to answer the demand of the law, and give for sin what the justice thereof required.","All angels had been crushed down to hell for ever, had that curse been laid upon them for our sins, which was laid upon Jesus Christ; but it was laid upon him, and he bare it; and answered the penalty, and redeemed his people from under it, with that satisfaction to Divine justice that God himself doth now proclaim, That he is faithful and just to forgive us, if by faith we shall venture to Jesus, and trust to what he has done for life (Rom 3:24-26; John 1:4).",(2.),"Life must be by Jesus Christ, that God might be adored and magnified, for finding out this way.","This is the Lord's doings, that in all things he might be glorified through Jesus Christ our Lord.",(3.),"It must be by Jesus Christ, that life might be at God's dispose, who hath great pity for the poor, the lowly, the meek, the broken in heart, and for them that others care not for (Psa 34:6; 138:6; 25; 51:17; 147:3).",(4.),"Life must be in Christ, to cut off boasting from the lips of men.","This also is the apostle's reason in Romans 3:19,27 (Eph 2:8-10).",2.,Life must be in Jesus Christ with respect to us.,(1.),"That we might have it upon the easiest terms, to wit, freely: as a gift, not as wages.","Was it in Moses' hand, we should come hardly at it.","Was it in the pope's hand, we should pay soundly for it.","20 But thanks be to God, it is in Christ, laid up in him, and by him to be communicated to sinners upon easy terms, even for receiving, accepting, and embracing with thanksgiving; as the Scriptures plainly declare (John 1:11,12; 2 Cor 11:4; Heb 11:13; Col 3:13-15).",(2.),"Life is in Christ FOR US, that it might not be upon so brittle a foundation, as indeed it would had it been anywhere else.","The law itself is weak because of us, as to this.","But Christ is a tried stone, a sure foundation, one that will not fail to bear thy burden, and to receive thy soul, coming sinner.",(3.),"Life is in Christ, that it might be sure to all the seed.",Alas!,"the best of us, was life left in our hand, to be sure we should forfeit it, over, and over, and over; or, was it in any other hand, we should, by our often backslidings, so offend him, that at last he would shut up his bowels in everlasting displeasure against us.","But now it is in Christ, it is with one that can pity, pray for, pardon, yea, multiply pardons; it is with one that can have compassion upon us, when we are out of the way; with one that hath an heart to fetch us again, when we are gone astray; with one that can pardon without upbraiding.","Blessed be God, that life is in Christ!",For now it is sure to all the seed.,"But, Fourth, This doctrine of coming to Jesus Christ for life informs us of the evil of unbelief; that wicked thing that is the only or chief hindrance to the coming sinner.","Doth the text say, ""Come?""","Doth it say, ""and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out?""",Then what an evil is that that keepeth sinners from coming to Jesus Christ!,And that evil is unbelief: for by faith we come; by unbelief we keep away.,"Therefore it is said to be that by which a soul is said to depart from God; because it was that which at first caused the world to go off from him, and that also that keeps them from him to this day.","And it doth it the more easily, because it doth it with a wile.",[Of the Sin of Unbelief.],"--This sin may be called the white devil, for it oftentimes, in its mischievous doings in the soul, shows as if it was an angel of light: yea, it acteth like a counsellor of heaven.",Therefore a little to discourse of this evil disease.,1.,"It is that sin, above all others, that hath some show of reason in its attempts.","For it keeps the soul from Christ by pretending its present unfitness and unpreparedness; as want of more sense of sin, want of more repentance, want of more humility, want of a more broken heart.",2.,"It is the sin that most suiteth with the conscience: the conscience of the coming sinner tells him that he hath nothing good; that he stands inditeable for ten thousand talents; that he is a very ignorant, blind, and hard-hearted sinner, unworthy to be once taken notice of by Jesus Christ.","And will you, says Unbelief, in such a case as you now are, presume to come to Jesus Christ?",3.,It is the sin that most suiteth with our sense of feeling.,"The coming sinner feels the workings of sin, of all manner of sin and wretchedness in his flesh; he also feels the wrath and judgment of God due to sin, and ofttimes staggers under it.","Now, says Unbelief, you may see you have no grace; for that which works in you is corruption.","You may also perceive that God doth not love you, because the sense of his wrath abides upon you.","Therefore, how can you bear the face to come to Jesus Christ?",4.,"It is that sin, above all others, that most suiteth with the wisdom of our flesh.","The wisdom of our flesh thinks it prudent to question awhile, to stand back awhile, to hearken to both sides awhile; and not to be rash, sudden, or unadvised, in too bold a presuming upon Jesus Christ.",And this wisdom unbelief falls in with.,5.,"It is that sin, above all other, that continually is whispering the soul in the ear with mistrusts of the faithfulness of God, in keeping promise to them that come to Jesus Christ for life.","It also suggests mistrust about Christ's willingness to receive it, and save it.",And no sin can do this so artificially as unbelief.,6.,"It is also that sin which is always at hand to enter an objection against this or that promise that by the Spirit of God is brought to our heart to comfort us; and if the poor coming sinner is not aware of it, it will, by some evasion, slight, trick, or cavil, quickly wrest from him the promise again, and he shall have but little benefit of it.",7.,"It is that, above all other sins, that weakness our prayers, our faith, our love, our diligence, our hope, and expectations: it even taketh the heart away from God in duty.",8.,"Lastly, This sin, as I have said even now, it appeareth in the soul with so many sweet pretences to safety and security, that it is, as it were, counsel sent from heaven; bidding the soul be wise, wary, considerate, well-advised, and to take heed of too rash a venture upon believing.","Be sure, first, that God loves you; take hold of no promise until you are forced by God unto it; neither be you sure of your salvation; doubt it still, though the testimony of the Lord has been often confirmed in you.","Live not by faith, but by sense; and when you can neither see nor feel, then fear and mistrust, then doubt and question all.","This is the devilish counsel of unbelief, which is so covered over with specious pretences, that the wisest Christian can hardly shake off these reasonings.",[Qualities of unbelief as opposed to faith.],--But to be brief.,"Let me here give thee, Christian reader, a more particular description of the qualities of unbelief, by opposing faith unto it, in these twenty-five particulars:-- 1.",Faith believeth the Word of God; but unbelief questioneth the certainty of the same (Psa 106:24).,2.,"Faith believeth the Word, because it is true; but unbelief doubteth thereof, because it is true (1 Tim 4:3; John 8:45).",3.,"Faith sees more in a promise of God to help, than in all other things to hinder; but unbelief, notwithstanding God's promise, saith, How can these things be?","(Rom 4:19-21; 2 Kings 7:2; John 3:11,12).",4.,"Faith will make thee see love in the heart of Christ, when with his mouth he giveth reproofs; but unbelief will imagine wrath in his heart, when with his mouth and Word he saith he loves us (Matt 15:22,28; Num 13; 2 Chron 14:3).",5.,"Faith will help the soul to wait, though God defers to give; but unbelief will take huff and throw up all, if God makes any tarrying (Psa 25:5; Isa 8:17; 2 Kings 6:33; Psa 106:13,14).",6.,"Faith will give comfort in the midst of fears; but unbelief causeth fears in the midst of comfort (2 Chron 20:20,21; Matt 8:26; Luke 24:26,27).",7.,Faith will suck sweetness out of God's rod; but unbelief can find no comfort in his greatest mercies (Psa 23:4; Num 21).,8.,"Faith maketh great burdens light; but unbelief maketh light ones intolerably heavy (2 Cor 4:1; 14-18; Mal 1:12,13).",9.,Faith helpeth us when we are down; but unbelief throws us down when we are up (Micah 7:8-10; Heb 4:11).,10.,"Faith bringeth us near to God when we are far from him; but unbelief puts us far from God when we are near to him (Heb 10:22; 3:12,13).",11.,"Where faith reigns, it declareth men to be the friends of God; but where unbelief reigns, it declareth them to be his enemies (John 3:23; Heb 3:18; Rev 21:8).",12.,Faith putteth a man under grace; but unbelief holdeth him under wrath (Rom 3:24-26; 14:6; Eph 2:8; John 3:36; 1 John 5:10; Heb 3:17; Mark 16:16).,13.,"Faith purifieth the heart; but unbelief keepeth it polluted and impure (Acts 15:9; Titus 1:15,16).",14.,"By faith, the righteousness of Christ is imputed to us; but by unbelief, we are shut up under the law to perish (Rom 4:23,24; 11:32; Gal 3:23).",15.,Faith maketh our work acceptable to God through Christ; but whatsoever is of unbelief is sin.,For without faith it is impossible to please him (Heb 11:4; Rom 14:23; Heb 6:6).,16.,"Faith giveth us peace and comfort in our souls; but unbelief worketh trouble and tossings, like the restless waves of the sea (Rom 5:1; James 1:6).",17.,"Faith maketh us to see preciousness in Christ; but unbelief sees no form, beauty, or comeliness in him (1 Peter 2:7; Isa 53:2,3).",18.,By faith we have our life in Christ's fullness; but by unbelief we starve and pine away (Gal 2:20).,19.,"Faith gives us the victory over the law, sin, death, the devil, and all evils; but unbelief layeth us obnoxious to them all (1 John 5:4,5; Luke 12:46).",20.,"Faith will show us more excellency in things not seen, than in them that are; but unbelief sees more in things that are seen, than in things that will be hereafter;.",(2 Cor 4:18; Heb 11:24-27; 1 Cor 15:32).,21.,"Faith makes the ways of God pleasant and admirable; but unbelief makes them heavy and hard (Gal 5:6; 1 Cor 12:10,11; John 6:60; Psa 2:3).",22.,"By faith Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob possessed the land of promise; but because of unbelief, neither Aaron, nor Moses, nor Miriam could get thither (Heb 11:9; 3:19).",23.,By faith the children of Israel passed through the Red Sea; but by unbelief the generality of them perished in the wilderness (Heb 11:29; Jude 5).,24.,"By faith Gideon did more with three hundred men, and a few empty pitchers, than all the twelve tribes could do, because they believed not God (Judg 7:16-22; Num 14:11,14).",25.,By faith Peter walked on the water; but by unbelief he began to sink (Matt 14:28-30).,"Thus might many more be added, which, for brevity's sake, I omit; beseeching every one that thinketh he hath a soul to save, or be damned, to take heed of unbelief; lest, seeing there is a promise left us of entering into his rest, any of us by unbelief should indeed come short of it.",USE SECOND.,The second use--A USE OF EXAMINATION.,We come now to a use of examination.,"Sinner, thou hast heard of the necessity of coming to Christ; also of the willingness of Christ to receive the coming soul; together with the benefit that they by him shall have that indeed come to him.","Put thyself now upon this serious inquiry, Am I indeed come to Jesus Christ?","Motives plenty I might here urge, to prevail with thee to a conscientious performance of this duty.","As, 1.","Thou art in sin, in the flesh, in death, in the snare of the devil, and under the curse of the law, if you are not coming to Jesus Christ.",2.,"There is no way to be delivered from these, but by coming to Jesus Christ.",3.,"If thou comest, Jesus Christ will receive thee, and will in no wise cast thee out.",4.,"Thou wilt not repent it in the day of judgment, if now thou comest to Jesus Christ.",5.,"But thou wilt surely mourn at last, if now thou shalt refuse to come.",6.,"And lastly, Now thou hast been invited to come; now will thy judgment be greater, and thy damnation more fearful, if thou shalt yet refuse, than if thou hadst never heard of coming to Christ.",Object.,But we hope we are come to Jesus Christ.,Answ.,It is well if it proves so.,"But lest thou shouldst speak without ground, and so fall unawares into hell-fire, let us examine a little.","First, Art thou indeed come to Jesus Christ?",What hast thou left behind thee?,"What didst thou come away from, in thy coming to Jesus Christ?","When Lot came out of Sodom, he left the Sodomites behind him (Gen 19).","When Abraham came out of Chaldea, he left his country and kindred behind him (Gen 12; Acts 7).","When Ruth came to put her trust under the wings of the Lord God of Israel, she left her father and mother, her gods, and the land of her nativity, behind her (Ruth 1:15-17; 2:11,12).","When Peter came to Christ, he left his nets behind him (Matt 4:20).","When Zaccheus came to Christ, he left the receipt of custom behind him (Luke 19).","When Paul came to Christ, he left his own righteousness behind him (Phil 3:7,8).","When those that used curious arts came to Jesus Christ, they took their curious books and burned them; though, in another man's eye, they were counted worth fifty thousand pieces of silver (Acts 19:18-20).","What sayest thou, man?","Hast thou left thy darling sins, thy Sodomitish pleasures, thy acquaintance and vain companions, thy unlawful gain, thy idol-gods, thy righteousness, and thy unlawful curious arts, behind thee?","If any of these be with thee, and thou with them, in thy heart and life, thou art not yet come to Jesus Christ.","Second, Art thou come to Jesus Christ?",Prithee tell me what moved thee to come to Jesus Christ?,"Men do not usually come or go to this or that place, before they have a moving cause, or rather a cause moving them thereto.","No more do they come to Jesus Christ--I do not say, before they have a cause, but--before that cause moveth them to come.",What sayest thou?,Hast thou a cause moving thee to come?,"To be at present in a state of condemnation, is cause sufficient for men to come to Jesus Christ for life.","But that will not do, except the cause move them; the which it will never do, until their eyes be opened to see themselves in that condition.","For it is not a man's being under wrath, but his seeing it, that moveth him to come to Jesus Christ.",Alas!,all men by sin are under wrath; yet but few of that all come to Jesus Christ.,"And the reason is, because they do not see their condition.","""Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?""",(Matt 3:7).,"Until men are warned, and also receive the warning, they will not come to Jesus Christ.",Take three or four instances for this.,"Adam and Eve came not to Jesus Christ until they received the alarm, the conviction of their undone state by sin.","(Gen 3) The children of Israel cried not out for a mediator before they saw themselves in danger of death by the law (Exo 20:18,19).","Before the publican came, he saw himself lost and undone (Luke 18:13).","The prodigal came not, until he saw death at the door, ready to devour him (Luke 15:17,18).","The three thousand came not, until they knew not what to do to be saved (Acts 2:37-39).","Paul came not, until he saw himself lost and undone (Acts 9:3-8,11).","Lastly, Before the jailer came, he saw himself undone (Acts 16:29-31).","And I tell thee, it is an easier thing to persuade a well man to go to the physician for cure, or a man without hurt to seek for a plaster to cure him, than it is to persuade a man that sees not his soul-disease, to come to Jesus Christ.",The whole have no need of the physician; then why should they go to him?,The full pitcher can hold no more; then why should it go to the fountain?,"And if thou comest full, thou comest not aright; and be sure Christ will send thee empty away.","""But he healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds"" (Mark 2:17;

he casteth all thine iniquities behind his back (Isa 38:17).",Thy sins and iniquities he will remember no more (Heb 8:12).,4.,"That Christ is free, is manifest by the complaints that he makes against them that will not come to him for mercy.","I say, he complains, saying, ""O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!","how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!""",(Matt 23:37).,"I say, he speaks it by way of complaint.","He saith also in another place, ""But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob"" (Isa 43:22).","Coming sinner, see here the willingness of Christ to save; see here how free he is to communicate life, and all good things, to such as thou art.","He complains, if thou comest not; he is displeased, if thou callest not upon him.","Hark, coming sinner, once again;

OR, NO WAY TO HEAVEN BUT BY JESUS CHRIST.",ADVERTISEMENT BY THE EDITOR.,This is one of those ten excellent manuscripts which were found among Bunyan's papers after his decease in 1688.,"It had been prepared by him for publication, but still wanted a few touches of his masterly hand, and a preface in his characteristic style.","He had, while a prisoner for nonconformity, in 1672, published a treatise upon this subject, in reply to Mr. Fowler, who was soon after created Bishop of Gloucester; but that was more peculiarly intended to prove that those who are justified by faith in Christ are placed in a safer, more honourable, and more glorious state than that possessed by Adam before his fall.","Mr. Fowler took the popular view, that the sufferings of the Saviour were intended to replace man in a similar position to that of Adam when in a state of innocence; and to give him powers, which, if properly used, would enable him to save himself.",It is of important that we should understand the meaning of the term 'justification' as here used.,"It is an acquittal, on being tried by the law; or a proof that, upon the most penetrating scrutiny, we have, through life, fulfilled and performed all its requirements in word, thought, and deed, without the slightest deviation or taint of error.","This is essential to salvation, and must be done, either personally, or by the imputation of the Saviour's obedience to us.","Multitudes vainly imagine that this can be attained by our partial obedience, aided, where we fail, by the imputation of so much of the Saviour's obedience as, being placed to our account, will make up the deficiency.",Upon justification must depend the salvation of the soul.,"Bunyan was convinced that the sinner's only hope was by the imputation of Christ's righteousness, which alone could justify him from ALL things, and without which he must perish.","As 'by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified,' it becomes an important inquiry whether the law, by which all must be tried, and justified or condemned, is opposed to the gospel or glad tidings of salvation?",God forbid that we should for a moment entertain such a thought!,"they both proceed from the same Divine source, and the gospel confirms and establishes the law.",This is clearly shown in the following treatise.,"Every Christian forms a part of that one mystical body, of which Christ is the head, and in which alone can be fulfilled every jot and tittle of the law.","Bunyan's controversy is with an opinion, held by many, that a man may, in his own person, by an imperfect obedience to some of the requirements of the law, procure, or aid in obtaining, justification.","There can be no subject more intensely interesting than the means of a sinner's justification before that God whose law is perfect, and who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity except with abhorrence; nor is there one upon which more fatal mistakes have been made.","The great delusion which like a deadly leprosy, has involved man in uncertainty and darkness in all his conceptions of purity and holiness, is the fallacious hope of producing some good works to blot out transgressions; or that man is not so polluted, but that he may justify himself by works performed through some kind of ability communicated by the Saviour--an ability which he might or might not use, but upon the proper use of which he considers that his salvation depends; leaving him in the most distressing uncertainty and doubt upon this all-important subject.","All these Bunyan considered to be specious and most dangerous devices of Satan, unscriptural, and contrary to the simplicity and design of the gospel.","In this treatise very powerful arguments are used to counteract these errors, and to place the doctrine of justification in all its glorious purity.","It is essentially the source of the glad tidings of great joy made known by the Christian dispensation; showing that the redemption of believers is perfect and finished, neither needing nor suffering any human additions.","The righteousness of Christ fully justifies all that believe, while the fountain that he opened washes away all their defilements, and presents them at the judgment-seat, without spot or blemish, their robes being washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb.","To prevent this doctrine from being impeached with a tendency to weaken man in the discharge of his moral duties, the same Divine power which thus pardoned sin has decreed that a sense of pardoning love should impel the redeemed to walk in newness of life--and that it is only while thus walking in holy obedience that they have an evidence of being members of Christ's mystical body.","For, 'whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son; whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified.'","So full is this of consolation and felicity that the apostle exclaims, 'If God be for us, who can be against us?'","Thus, salvation by free grace is inseparably connected with good works.","The righteousness of the second Adam, the Lord from heaven, imputed to his members, justifies them, in the same manner as the disobedience of the first Adam, imputed to all his members or posterity, makes them sinners.","To use the expressive words of Bunyan, 'The sinner is justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while a sinner in himself.'",This is a startling fact.,"That Rahab or Mary Magdalene, and even Saul, the murderous persecutor, were, in the sight and purposes of God, justified, while they were, in the esteem of God's saints, in a state of the vilest sin, is a doctrine revolting to the pride of human nature.","But we should recollect that, in the sight of God, a thousand years are but as one day; while one day may be magnified into a thousand years; and that the purposes of God are concealed to us while sin blinds our eyes.","Rahab and Magdalene were wretched before their conversion, nor could Saul have been much less wretched, while carrying misery into the hearts and families of God's saints.","There can be no real happiness without spiritual life--holy obedience to the Divine will, and a scriptural hope of justification before God and his law.",These are the means he uses to make known to us his secret purposes.,"No man has lived in the world, since the inspired writers, more capable of detecting the devil's sophistry upon this subject than John Bunyan.",He had passed through a furnace of experience while seeking justification.,"He well knew that, upon keeping the moral law of God, the peace of the world and our personal happiness depended.",How is this great object to be accomplished?,"If we attempt to keep it, in order to gain eternal life, we shall fail, as all others have done.","In every attempt thus to keep it, to use Bunyan's expression 'The guilt of sin, which is by the law, makes such a noise and horror in my conscience that I can neither hear nor see the word of peace, unless it is spoken with a voice from heaven!'",Our polluted nature leads to sin; a mist is before our eyes; we 'go astray speaking lies.',The strong natural bias to break the law will prevail; we see its effects in the great bulk of those who are taught to rely upon ceremonies and upon keeping the law.,"Who are so lawless, so little advanced in civilization, as the poor Irish, Spaniards, or Italians?","while those who seek justification as the free gift of God, influenced by gratitude and love, are found walking in obedience to the Divine law; their only regret is, that they cannot live more to the glory of their Saviour.","The doctrines of grace, as exhibited in this treatise, have ever produced glory to God, on earth peace, and goodwill to men; although that spirit which called Christ a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, still charges these doctrines as having a tendency to licentiousness.","Christian, be not offended with the humbling, but scriptural views, which Bunyan entertained of every church of Christ 'An hospital of sick, wounded, and afflicted people.'","None but such as feel their need of the Physician of souls are fit for church membership, or are safely on the road to heaven.","Leaving this solemn and interesting subject to the prayerful attention of the reader, I shall conclude my advertisement by quoting from a characteristic specimen of Bunyan's style of writing, and it was doubtless his striking mode of preaching:--'Faith doth the same against the devil that unbelief doth to God.",Doth unbelief count God a liar?,Faith counts the devil a liar.,Doth unbelief hold the soul from the mercy of God?,Faith holds the soul from the malice of the devil.,Doth unbelief quench thy graces?,Faith kindleth them even into a flame.,Doth unbelief fill the soul full of sorrow?,Faith fills it full of the joy of the Holy Ghost.,"In a word, Doth unbelief bind down thy sins upon thee?","Why, faith in Jesus Christ releaseth thee of them all.'",GEO.,OFFOR.,JUSTIFICATION BY AN IMPUTED RIGHTEOUSNESS JUSTIFICATION is to be diversly taken in the Scripture.,Sometimes it is taken for the justification of persons; sometimes for the justification of actions; and sometimes for the justification of the person and action too.,"It is taken for the justification of persons, and that, as to justification with God; or, as to justification with men.","As to justification with God; that is, when a man stands clear, quit, free, or, in a saved condition before him, in the approbation of his holy law.","As to justification with men; that is, when a man stands clear and quit from just ground of reprehension with them.","Justification also is to be taken with reference to actions; and that may be when they are considered, as flowing from true faith; or, because the act done fulfils some transient law.","[1] As actions flow from faith, so they are justified, because done before God in, and made complete through, the perfections of Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:5; Heb 13:15; Rev 8:1-4).",As by the doing of the act some transient law is fulfilled; as when Jehu executed judgment upon the house of Ahab.,"'Thou hast done well,' said God to him, 'in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart' (2 Kings 10:30).","As to such acts, God may or may not look at the qualification of those that do them; and it is clear that he had not respect to any good that was in Jehu in the justifying of this action; nor could he; for Jehu stuck close yet to the sins of Jeroboam, but 'took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel' (2 Kings 10:29,31).",I might hence also show you that a man may be justified even then when his action is condemned; also that a man may be in a state of condemnation when his action may be justified.,"But with these distinctions I will not take up time, my intention being to treat of justification as it sets a man free or quit from sin, the curse and condemnation of the law in the sight of God, in order to eternal salvation.","And that I may with the more clearness handle this point before you, I will lay down and speak to this PROPOSITION.","THAT THERE IS NO OTHER WAY FOR SINNERS TO BE JUSTIFIED FROM THE CURSE OF THE LAW IN THE SIGHT OF GOD, THAN BY THE IMPUTATION OF THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS LONG AGO PERFORMED BY, AND STILL RESIDING WITH, THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST.","The terms of this proposition are easy; yet if it will help, I will speak a word or two for explication.",First.,"By a sinner, I mean one that has transgressed the law; 'for sin is the transgression of the law' (1 John 3:4).",Second.,"By the curse of the law, I mean that sentence, judgment, or condemnation which the law pronounceth against the transgressor (Gal 3:10).",Third.,"By justifying righteousness, I mean that which stands in the doing and suffering of Christ when he was in the world (Rom 5:19).",Fourth.,"By the residing of this righteousness in Christ's person, I mean it still abides with him as to the action, though the benefit is bestowed upon those that are his.",Fifth.,"By the imputation of it to us, I mean God's making of it ours by an act of his grace, that we by it might be secured from the curse of the law.",Sixth.,When I say there is no other way to be justified.,"I cast away TO THAT END the law, and all the works of the law as done by us.",[2] Thus I have opened the terms of the proposition.,First and Second.,"Now the two first--to wit, what sin and the curse is--stand clear in all men's sight, unless they be atheists or desperately heretical.","I shall, therefore, in few words, clear the other four.",Third.,Therefore justifying righteousness is the doing and suffering of Christ when he was in the world.,"This is clear, because we are said to be 'justified by his obedience,' by his obedience to the law (Rom 5:19).","Hence he is said again to be the end of the law for that very thing--'Christ is the end of the law for righteousness,' &c. (Rom 10:4).","The end, what is that?","Why, the requirement or demand of the law.",But what are they?,"Why, righteousness, perfect righteousness (Gal 3:10).","Perfect righteousness, what to do?",That the soul concerned might stand spotless in the sight of God (Rev 1:5).,"Now this lies only in the doings and sufferings of Christ; for 'by his obedience many are made righteous'; wherefore as to this, Christ is the end of the law, that being found in that obedience, that becomes to us sufficient for our justification.","Hence we are said to be made righteous by his obedience; yea, and to be washed, purged, and justified by his blood (Heb 9:14; Rom 5:18,19).",Fourth.,"That this righteousness still resides in and with the person of Christ, even then when we stand just before God thereby, is clear, for that we are said, when justified, to be justified 'in him.'",'In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified.',"And again, 'Surely, shall one say, In the Lord have I righteousness,' &c. (Isa 45:24,25).","And again, 'But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us--righteousness' (1 Cor 1:30).","Mark, the righteousness is still 'in him,' not 'in us,' even then when we are made partakers of the benefit of it; even as the wing and feathers still abide in the hen when the chickens are covered, kept, and warmed thereby.","For as my doings, though my children are fed and clothed thereby, are still my doings, not theirs; so the righteousness wherewith we stand just before God from the curse, still resides in Christ, not in us.","Our sins, when laid upon Christ, were yet personally ours, not his; so his righteousness, when put upon us, is yet personally his, not ours.","What is it, then?","Why, 'he was made to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him' (2 Cor 5:21).",[3] Fifth.,"It is, therefore, of a justifying virtue, only by imputation, or as God reckoneth it to us; even as our sins made the Lord Jesus a sinner--nay, 'sin,' by God's reckoning of them to him.","It is absolutely necessary that this be known of us; for if the understanding be muddy as to this, it is impossible that such should be sound in the faith; also in temptation, that man will be at a loss that looketh for a righteousness for justification in himself, when it is to be found nowhere but in Jesus Christ.","The apostle, who was his craftsmaster as to this, was always 'looking to Jesus,' that he 'might be found in him,' knowing that nowhere else could peace or safety be had (Phil 3:6-9).","And, indeed, this is one of the greatest mysteries in the world; namely, that a righteousness that resides with a person in heaven should justify me, a sinner, on earth!",Sixth.,"Therefore the law and the works thereof, as to this, must by us be cast away; not only because they here are useless, but also they being retained are a hindrance.","That they are useless is evident, for that salvation comes by another name (Acts 4:12).","And that they are a hindrance, it is clear; for the very adhering to the law, though it be but a little, or in a little part, prevents justification by the righteousness of Christ (Rom 9:31,32).",What shall I say?,"As to this, the moral law is rejected, the ceremonial law is rejected, and man's righteousness is rejected, for that they are here both weak and unprofitable (Rom 8:2,3; Gal 3:21; Heb 10:1-12).","Now if all these and their works as to our justification, are rejected, where, but in Christ, is righteousness to be found?","Thus much, therefore, for the explication of the proposition--namely, that there is no other way for sinners to be justified from the curse of the law in the sight of God, than by the imputation of that righteousness long ago performed by, and still residing with, the person of Jesus Christ.",[Two Positions.],"Now, from this proposition I draw these two positions--FIRST.",THAT MEN ARE JUSTIFIED FROM THE CURSE OF THE LAW BEFORE GOD WHILE SINNERS IN THEMSELVES.,SECOND.,"THAT THIS CAN BE DONE BY NO OTHER RIGHTEOUSNESS THAN THAT LONG AGO PERFORMED BY, AND RESIDING WITH, THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST.",[FIRST POSITION] FIRST.,"Let us, then, now enter into the consideration of the first of these--namely, THAT MEN ARE JUSTIFIED FROM THE CURSE OF THE LAW BEFORE GOD WHILE SINNERS IN THEMSELVES.","This I shall manifest, FIRST, By touching upon the mysterious acts of our redemption; SECOND, By giving of you plain texts which discover it; and, THIRD, By reasons drawn from the texts.",FIRST.,"For the first of these; to wit, the mysterious act of our redemption: and that I shall speak to under these two heads--First, I shall show you what that is; and, Second, How we are concerned therein.",First.,[What that is.],"That which I call, and that rightly, the mysterious act of our redemption, is Christ's sufferings as a common,[4] though a particular person and as a sinner, though always completely righteous.",That he suffered as a common person is true.,"By common, I mean a public person, or one that presents the body of mankind in himself.","This a multitude of scriptures bear witness to, especially that fifth chapter to the Romans, where, by the apostle, he is set before us as the head of all the elect, even as Adam was once head of all the world.","Thus he lived, and thus he died; and this was a mysterious act.","And that he should die as a sinner, when yet himself did 'no sin,' nor had any 'guile found in his mouth,' made this act more mysterious (1 Pet 1:19, 2:22, 3:18).",That he died as a sinner is plain--'He hath made him to be sin.,And the Lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all' (Isa 53).,"That, then, as to his own person he was completely sinless is also as truly manifest, and that by a multitude of scriptures.","Now, I say, that Christ Jesus should be thus considered, and thus die, was the great mystery of God.","Hence Paul tells us, that when he preached 'Christ crucified,' he preached not only the 'wisdom of God,' but the 'wisdom of God in a mystery,' even his 'hidden wisdom,' for, indeed, this wisdom is hidden, and kept close from the 'fowls of the air' (1 Cor 1:24, 2:7,8; Job 28:20,21).","It is also so mysterious, that it goes beyond the reach of all men, except those to whom an understanding is given of God to apprehend it (1 John 5:20).","That one particular man should represent all the elect in himself, and that the most righteous should die as a sinner, yea, as a sinner by the hand of a just and holy God, is a mystery of the greatest depth!",Second.,"And now I come to show you how the elect are concerned therein; that is, in this mysterious act of this most blessed One; and this will make this act yet more mysterious to you.","Now, then, we will speak of this first, as to how Christ prepared himself thus mysteriously to act.",He took hold of our nature.,"I say, he took hold of us, by taking upon him flesh and blood.","The Son of God, therefore, took not upon him a particular person, though he took to him a human body and soul; but that which he took was, as I may call it, a lump of the common nature of man; and by that, hold of the whole elect seed of Abraham; 'For verily he took not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham' (Heb 2:16) Hence he, in a mystery, became us, and was counted as all the men that were or should be saved.","And this is the reason why we are said to do, when only Jesus Christ did do.",As for instance-- 1.,"When Jesus Christ fulfilled the righteousness of the law, it is said it was fulfilled in us, because indeed fulfilled in our nature: 'For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,' &c. (Rom 8:3,4).","But because none should appropriate this unto themselves that have not had passed upon them a work of conversion, therefore he adds, 'Who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit' (v. 4).","For there being a union between head and members, though things may be done by the head, and that for the members, the things are counted to the members, as if not done only by the head.","'The righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us'; and that truly, because fulfilled in that common nature which the Son of God took of the Virgin.","Wherefore, in this sense we are said to do what only was done by him; even as the client doth by his lawyer, when his lawyer personates him; the client is said to do, when it is the lawyer only that does; and to overcome by doing, when it is the lawyer that overcomes; the reason is, because the lawyer does in the client's name.","How much more then may it be said we do, when only Christ does; since he does what he does, not in our name only, but in our nature too; 'for the law of the spirit of life in Christ.'","not in me, 'hath made me free from the law of sin and death' (Rom 8:2); he doing in his common flesh what could not be done in my particular person, that so I might have the righteousness of the law fulfilled in me, [that is, in] my flesh assumed by Christ; though impossible to be done [by me], because of the weakness of my person.","The reason of all this is, because we are said to be in him in his doing, in him by our flesh, and also by the election of God.","So, then, as all men sinned when Adam fell, so all the elect did righteousness when Christ wrought and fulfilled the law; 'for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive' (1 Cor 15:22).",2.,"As we are said to do by Christ, so we are said to suffer by him, to suffer with him.","'I am crucified with Christ,' said Paul.","And again, 'Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin' (1 Peter 4:1).",Mark how the apostle seems to change the person.,"First he says, it is Christ that suffered; and that is true; but then he insinuates that it is us that suffered, for the exhortation is to believers, to 'walk in newness of life' (Rom 6:4).","And the argument is, because they have suffered in the flesh, 'For he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God' (1 Peter 4:1,2).","We then suffered, when Christ suffered; we then suffered in his flesh, and also our 'old man was crucified with him' (Rom 6:6); that is, in his crucifixion; for when he hanged on the cross, all the elect hanged there in their common flesh which he assumed, and because he suffered there as a public man.",3.,"As we are said to suffer with him, so we are said to die, to be dead with him; with him, that is, by the dying of his body.","'Now, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him' (Rom 6:8).","Wherefore he saith in other places, 'Brethren, ye are become dead to the law by the body of Christ'; for indeed we died then to it by him.","To the law--that is, the law now has nothing to do with us; for that it has already executed its curse to the full upon us by its slaying of the body of Christ; for the body of Christ was our flesh: upon it also was laid our sin.","The law, too, spent that curse that was due to us upon him, when it condemned, killed, and cast him into the grave.","Wherefore, it having thus spent its whole curse upon him as standing in our stead, we are exempted from its curse for ever; we are become dead to it by that body (Rom 7:4).",It has done with us as to justifying righteousness.,"Nor need we fear its damning threats any more; for by the death of this body we are freed from it, and are for ever now coupled to a living Christ.",4.,"As we are said thus to be dead, so we are said also to rise again by him--'Thy dead men,' saith he to the Father, 'shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise' (Isa 26:19).","[5] And again, 'After two days he will revive us; in the third day--we shall live in his sight' (Hosea 6:2).","Both these scriptures speak of the resurrection of Christ, of the resurrection of his body on the third day; but behold, as we were said before to suffer and be dead with him, so now we are said also to rise and live in God's sight by the resurrection of his body.","For, as was said, the flesh was ours; he took part of our flesh when he came into the world; and in it he suffered, died, and rose again (Heb 2:14).","We also were therefore counted by God, in that God-man, when he did this; yea, he suffered, died, and rose as a common head.","[6] Hence also the New Testament is full of this, saying, 'If ye be dead with Christ' (Col 2:20).",'If ye be risen with Christ' (3:1).,"And again, 'He hath quickened us together with him' (2:13).",'We are quickened together with him.',"'Quickened,' and 'quickened together with him.'",The apostle hath words that cannot easily be shifted or evaded.,Christ then was quickened when he was raised from the dead.,Nor is it proper to say that he was ever quickened either before or since.,"This text also concludes that we--to wit, the whole body of God's elect, were also quickened then, and made to live with him together.","True, we also are quickened personally by grace the day in the which we are born unto God by the gospel; yet afore that, we are quickened in our Head; quickened when he was raised from the dead, quickened together with him.",5.,"Nor are we thus considered--to wit, as dying and rising, and so left; but the apostle pursues his argument, and tells us that we also reap by him, as being considered in him, the benefit which Christ received, both in order to his resurrection, and the blessed effect thereof.",(1.),"We received, by our thus being counted in him, that benefit which did precede his rising from the dead; and what was that but the forgiveness of sins?","For this stands clear to reason, that if Christ had our sins charged upon him at his death, he then must be discharged of them in order to his resurrection.","Now, though it is not proper to say they were forgiven to him, because they were purged from him by merit; yet they may be said to be forgiven us, because we receive this benefit by grace.","And this, I say, was done precedent to his resurrection from the dead.","'He hath quickened us together with him, HAVING forgiven us all trespasses.'","He could not be 'quickened' till we were 'discharged'; because it was not for himself, but for us, that he died.","Hence we are said to be at that time, as to our own personal estate, dead in our sins, even when we are 'quickened together with him' (Col 2:13).","Therefore both the 'quickening' and 'forgiveness' too, so far as we are in this text concerned, is to him, as we are considered in him, or to him, with respect to us.",'Having forgiven you ALL trespasses.',"For necessity so required; because else how was it possible that the pains of death should be loosed in order to his rising, so long as one sin stood still charged to him, as that for the commission of which God had not received a plenary satisfaction?","As therefore we suffered, died, and rose again by him, so, in order to his so rising, he, as presenting of us in his person and suffering, received for us remission of all our trespasses.","A full discharge therefore was, in and by Christ, received of God of all our sins afore he rose from the dead, as his resurrection truly declared; for he 'was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification' (Rom 4:25).","This therefore is one of the privileges we receive by the rising again of our Lord, for that we were in his flesh considered, yea, and in his death and suffering too.",(2.),By this means also we have now escaped death.,'Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.,"For in that he died, he died unto,' or for, 'sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God' (Rom 6:9,10).","Now in all this, considering what has been said before, we that are of the elect are privileged, for that we also are raised up by the rising of the body of Christ from the dead.","And thus the apostle bids us reckon: 'Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ' (Rom 6:11).","Hence Christ says, 'I am the resurrection and the life,' for that all his are safe in him, suffering, dying, and rising.","He is the life, 'our life'; yea, so our life, that by him the elect do live before God, even then when as to themselves they yet are dead in their sins.","Wherefore, hence it is that in time they partake of quickening grace from this their Head, to the making of them also live by faith, in order to their living hereafter with him in glory; for if Christ lives, they cannot die that were sharers with him in his resurrection.","[7] Hence they are said to 'live,' being 'quickened together with him.'","Also, as sure as at his resurrection they lived by him, so sure at his coming shall they be gathered to him; nay, from that day to this, all that, as aforesaid, were in him at his death and resurrection, are already, in the 'dispensation of the fulness of times,' daily 'gathering to him.'","For this he hath purposed, wherefore none can disannul it--'In the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are in earth; even in him' (Eph 1:10).",(3.),"To secure this the more to our faith that believe, as we are said to be 'raised up together' with him, so we are said to be 'made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus' (Eph 2:6).","We died by him, we rose by him, and are together, even all the elect, set down 'together' in 'heavenly places in Christ Jesus'; for still, even now he is on the right hand of God, he is to be considered as our public man, our Head, and so one in whom is concluded all the elect of God.","We then are by him already in heaven; in heaven, I say, by him; yea, set down there in our places of glory by him.","Hence the apostle, speaking of us again, saith, That as we are predestinate, we are called, justified, and glorified; called, justified, glorified; all is done, already done, as thus considered in Christ (Rom 8:30).",For that in his public work there is nothing yet to do as to this.,Is not HE called?,Is not HE justified?,Is not HE glorified?,"And are we not in him, in him, even as so considered?","Nor doth this doctrine hinder or forestal the doctrine of regeneration or conversion; nay, it lays a foundation for it; for by this doctrine we gather assurance that Christ will have his own; for if already they live in their head, what is that but a pledge that they shall live in their persons with him?","and, consequently, that to that end they shall, in the times allotted for that end, be called to a state of faith, which God has ordained shall precede and go before their personal enjoyment of glory.","Nor doth this hinder their partaking of the symbol of regeneration,[8] and of their other privileges to which they are called in the day of grace; yea, it lays a foundation for all these things; for if I am dead with Christ, let me be like one dead with him, even to all things to which Christ died when he hanged on the tree; and then he died to sin, to the law, and to the rudiments of this world (Rom 6:10, 7:4; Col 2:20).","And if I be risen with Christ, let me live, like one born from the dead, in newness of life, and having my mind and affections on the things where Christ now sitteth on the right hand of God.","And indeed he professes in vain that talketh of these things, and careth not to have them also answered in himself.","This was the apostle's way, namely, to covet to 'know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death' (Phil 3:10).","And when we are thus, that thing is true both in him and us.","Then as is the heavenly, such are they that are heavenly; for he that saith he is in him, and by being in him, a partaker of these privileges by him, 'ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked' (1 Cor 15:48; 1 John 2:6).","But to pass this digression, and to come to my argument, namely, that men are justified from the curse of the law, before God, while sinners in themselves; this is evident by what hath already been said; for if the justification of their persons is by, in, and through Christ; then it is not by, in, and through their own doings.","Nor was Christ engaged in this work but of necessity, even because else there had not been salvation for the elect.","'O my father,' saith he, 'if it be possible, let this cup pass from me' (Matt 26:39).",If what be possible?,"Why, that my elect may be saved, and I not spill my blood.","Wherefore he saith again, Christ ought to suffer (Luke 24:26).","'Christ must needs have suffered,' for 'without shedding of blood is no remission' of sin (Acts 17:3; Heb 9:22).",[9] [Proofs of the first position.],SECOND.,"We will now come to the present state and condition of those that are justified; I mean with respect to their own qualifications, and so prove the truth of this our great position.","And this I will do, by giving of you plain texts that discover it, and that consequently prove our point.","And after that, by giving of you reasons drawn from the texts.",First.,"'Speak not thou in thine heart,' no, not in thine heart, 'after that the Lord thy God hath cast them out [thine enemies] before thee, saying, For my righteousness--do I possess this land.--Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land.--Understand, therefore, that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiff-necked people' (Deut 9:4-6).","In these words, very pat for our purpose, two things are worthy our consideration.",1.,"The people here spoken to were the people of God; and so by God himself are they here twice acknowledged to be--'The Lord thy God, the Lord thy God.'","So then, the righteousness here intended is not the righteousness that is in the world, but that which the people of God perform.",2.,"The righteousness here intended is not some, but all, and every whit of that the church performs to God: Say not in thine heart, after the Lord hath brought thee in, It was for my righteousness.","No, all thy righteousness, from Egypt to Canaan, will not purchase Canaan for thee.","That this is true is evident, because it is thrice rejected--Not for thy righteousness--not for thy righteousness--not for thy righteousness, dost thou possess the land.","Now, if the righteousness of the people of God of old could not merit for them Canaan, which was but a type of heaven, how can the righteousness of the world now obtain heaven itself?","I say again, if godly men, as these were, could not by their works purchase the type of heaven, then must the ungodly be justified, if ever they be justified from the curse and sentence of the law, while sinners in themselves.","The argument is clear; for if good men, by what they do, cannot merit the less, bad men, by what they do, cannot merit more.",Second.,"'Remember me, O my God, concerning this; and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done' (Neh 13:14).","These words were spoken by holy Nehemiah, and that at the end of all the good that we read he did in the world.","Also, the deeds here spoken of were deeds done for God, for his people, for his house, and for the offices thereof.","Yet godly Nehemiah durst not stand before God in these, nor yet suffer them to stand to his judgment by the law; but prays to God to be merciful both to him and them, and to spare him 'according to the greatness of his mercy' (v 22).","God blots out no good but for the sake of sin;[10] and forasmuch as this man prays God would not blot out his, it is evident that he was conscious to himself that in his good works were sin.","Now, I say, if a good man's works are in danger of being overthrown because there is in them a tang of sin, how can bad men think to stand just before God in their works, which are in all parts full of sin?","Yea, if the works of a sanctified man are blameworthy, how shall the works of a bad man set him clear in the eyes of Divine justice?",Third.,"'But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away' (Isa 64:6).",In these words we have a relation both of persons and things.,1.,Of persons.,"And they are a righteous people, a righteous people put all together--'We, we all are,' &c. 2.","The condition of this people, even of ALL of them, take them at the best, are, and that by their own confession, 'as an unclean thing.'",3.,"Again; the things here attending this people are their good things, put down under this large character, 'Righteousnesses, ALL our righteousnesses.'","These expressions therefore comprehend all their religious duties, both before and after faith too.",But what are all these righteousnesses?,"Why, they are all as 'filthy rags' when set before the justice of the law; yea, it is also confessed, and that by these people, that their iniquities, notwithstanding all their righteousnesses, like the wind, if grace prevent not, would 'carry them away.'","This being so, how is it possible for one that is in his sins, to work himself into a spotless condition by works done before faith, by works done by natural abilities?","or to perform a righteousness which is able to look God in the face, his law in the face, and to demand and obtain the forgiveness of sins, and the life that is eternal?","It cannot be: 'men must therefore be justified from the curse, in the sight of God while sinners in themselves,' or not at all.",[11] Fourth.,"'There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not' (Eccl 7:20; 1 Kings 8:46).","Although the words before are large, yet these seem far larger; there is not a man, not a just man, not a just man upon the earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.","Now, if no good man, if no good man upon earth doth good, and sinneth not; then no good man upon earth can set himself by his own actions justified in the sight of God, for he has sin mixed with his good.","How then shall a bad man, any bad man, the best bad man upon earth, think to set himself by his best things just in the sight of God?","And if the tree makes the fruit either good or evil, then a bad tree--and a bad man is a bad tree--can bring forth no good fruit, how then shall such an one do that that shall 'cleanse him from his sin,' and set him as 'spotless before the face of God?'",(Matt 7:16).,Fifth.,"'Hearken unto me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness: I bring near my righteousness,' &c. (Isa 46:12-13).",1.,"This call is general, and so proves, whatever men think of themselves, that in the judgment of God there is none at all righteous.","Men, as men, are far from being so.",2.,"This general offer of righteousness, of the righteousness of God, declares that it is in vain for men to think to be set just and righteous before God by any other means.",3.,"There is here also insinuated, that for him that thinks himself the worst, God has prepared a righteousness, and therefore would not have him despair of life that sees himself far from righteousness.","From all these scriptures, therefore, it is manifest, 'that men must be justified from the curse of the law, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.'",Sixth.,"'Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest' (Matt 11:28).","Here we have a labouring people, a people labouring for life; but by all their labour, you see, they cannot ease themselves; their burden still remains upon them; they yet are heavy laden.","The load here is, doubtless, guilt of sin, such as David had when he said by reason thereof, he was not able to look up (Psa 38:3-5).","Hence, therefore, you have an experiment set before you of those that are trying what they can do for life; but behold, the more they stir, the more they sink under the weight of the burden that lies upon them.","[12] And the conclusion--to wit, Christ's call to them to come to him for rest--declares that, in his judgment, rest was not to be had elsewhere.","And I think, one may with as much safety adhere to Christ's judgment as to any man's alive; wherefore, 'men must be justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.'",Seventh.,"'There is none righteous, no, not one: there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.","They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one' (Rom 3:10-12).",These words have respect to a righteousness which is justified by the law; and they conclude that none by his own performances is righteous with such a righteousness; and it is concluded from five reasons--1.,"Because they are not good; for a man must be good before he doth good, and perfectly good before he doth good and sinneth not.",2.,Because they understand not.,How then should they do good?,"for a man must know before he does, else how should he divert[13] himself to do?",3.,Because they want a heart; they seek not after God according to the way of his own appointment.,4.,They are all gone out of the way; how then can they walk therein?,5.,They are together become unprofitable.,What worth or value then can there be in any of their doings?,"These are the reasons by which he proveth that there is 'none righteous, no, not one.'","And the reasons are weighty, for by them he proves the tree is not good; how then can it yield good fruit?","Now, as he concludes from these five reasons that not one indeed is righteous, so he concludes by five more that none can do good to make him so--1.","For that internally they are as an open sepulchre, as full of dead men's bones.",Their minds and consciences are defiled; how then can sweet and good proceed from thence?,(v 13).,2.,Their throat is filled with this stink; all their vocal duties therefore smell thereof.,3.,Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; how then can there be found one word that should please God?,4.,"Their tongue, which should present their praise to God, has been used to work deceit; how then, until it is made a new one, should it speak in righteousness?",5.,"The poison of asps is under their lips; therefore whatever comes from them must be polluted (Rom 3:11-14; Matt 23:27; Titus 1:15; Jer 44:17, 17:9).","Thus, you see, he sets forth their internal part, which being a true report, as to be sure it is, it is impossible that any good should so much as be framed in such an inward part, or come clean out of such a throat, by such a tongue, through such lips as these.",And yet this is not all.,"He also proves, and that by five reasons more, that it is not possible they should do good--1.",'Their feet are swift to shed blood' (Rom 3:15).,"This implies an inclination, an inward inclination to evil courses; a quickness of motion to do evil, but a backwardness to do good.",2.,'Destruction and misery are in their ways' (v16).,"Take 'ways' for their 'doings,' and in the best of them destruction lurks, and misery yet follows them at the heels.",3.,'The way of peace have they not known'; that is far above out of their sight (v 17).,"Wherefore the labour of these foolish ones will weary every one of them, because they know not the way that goes to the city (Eccl 10:15).",4.,'There is no fear of God before their eyes' (v 18).,How then can they do anything with that godly reverence of his holy Majesty that is and must be essential to every good work?,"for to do things, but not in God's fear, to what will it amount?",will it avail?,5.,All this while they are under a law that calls for works that are perfectly good; that will accept of none but what are perfectly good; and that will certainly condemn them because they neither are nor can be perfectly good.,"'For what things soever the law saith, it saith it to them who are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God' (v 19).","Thus you see that Paul here proves, by fifteen reasons, that none are, nor can be, righteous before God by works that they can do; therefore 'men must be justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.'",Eighth.,"'But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets' (v 21).",This text utterly excludes the law--what law?,"The law of works, the moral law, (v 27)--and makes mention of another righteousness, even a righteousness of God; for the righteousness of the law is the righteousness of men, men's 'own righteousness' (Phil 3:9).","Now, if the law, as to a justifying righteousness, is rejected; then the very matter upon and by which man should work is rejected; and if so, then he must be justified by the righteousness of God, or not at all; for he must be justified by a righteousness that is without the law; to wit, the righteousness of God.","Now, this righteousness of God, whatever it is, to be sure it is not a righteousness that flows from men; for that, as I said, is rejected, and the righteousness of God opposed unto it, being called a righteousness that is without the law, without our personal obedience to it.","The righteousness of God, or a righteousness of God's completing, a righteousness of God's bestowing, a righteousness that God also gives unto, and puts upon all them that believe (Rom 3:22), a righteousness that stands in the works of Christ, and that is imputed both by the grace and justice of God (v 24-26).","Where, now, is room for man's righteousness, either in the whole, or as to any part thereof?","I say, where, as to justification with God?",Ninth.,"'What shall we then say that Abraham, our father as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?'","(Rom 4:1) Now, the apostle is at the root of the matter; for Abraham is counted the father of the faithful; consequently, the man whose way of attaining justification must needs be exemplary to all the children of Abraham.","Now, the question is, how Abraham found?",how he found that which some of his children sought and missed?,"(Rom 9:32); that is, how he found justifying righteousness; for it was that which Israel sought and attained not unto (11:7).","'Did he find it,' saith Paul, 'by the flesh?'","or, as he was in the flesh?","or, by acts and works of the flesh?",But what are they?,"why, the next verse tells you 'they are the works of the law' (Rom 4).","'If Abraham was justified by works'; that is, as pertaining to the flesh; for the works of the law are none other but the best sort of the works of the flesh.","And so Paul calls all they that he had before his conversion to Christ: 'If any other man,' saith he, 'thinketh he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more.'","And then he counteth up several of his privileges, to which he at last adjoineth the righteousness of the moral law, saying, 'Touching the righteousness which is in the law, [I was] blameless' (Phil 3:4-6).","And it is proper to call the righteousness of the law the work of the flesh, because it is the work of a man, of a man in the flesh; for the Holy Ghost doth not attend the law, or the work thereof, as to this, in man, as man; that has confined itself to another ministration, whose glorious name it bears (2 Cor 3:8).","I say it is proper to call the works of the law the works of the flesh, because they are done by that self-same nature in and out of which comes all those things that are more grossly so called (Gal 5:19,20); to wit, from the corrupt fountain of fallen man's polluted nature (James 3:10).","This, saith Paul, was not the righteousness by which Abraham found justification with God--'For if Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.",For what saith the Scripture?,"Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness' (Rom 4:2-3).","This 'believing' is also set in flat opposition to 'works,' and to the 'law of works'; wherefore, upon pain of great contempt to God, it must not be reckoned as a work to justify withal, but rather as that which receiveth and applieth that righteousness.","From all this, therefore, it is manifest 'that men must be justified from the curse of the law, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.'","But, Tenth.","'Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt' (Rom 4:4).","These words do not only back what went before, as to the rejection of the law for righteousness as to justification with God, but supposing the law was of force to justify, life must not be admitted to come that way, because of the evil consequences that will unavoidably flow therefrom.",1.,"By this means, grace, and justification by grace, would be rejected; and that would be a foul business; it would not be reckoned of grace.",2.,"By this, God would become the debtor, and so the underling; and so we in this the more honourable.","It would not be reckoned of grace, but of debt; and what would follow from hence?","Why, (1.)","By this we should frustrate the design of Heaven, which is, to justify us freely by grace, through a redemption brought in by Christ (Rom 3:24-26; Eph 2:8-13).",(2.),"By this we should make ourselves the saviours, and jostle Christ quite out of doors (Gal 5:2-4).",(3.),"We should have heaven at our own dispose, as a debt, not by promise, and so not be beholden to God for it (Gal 3:18).","It must, then, be of grace, not of works, for the preventing of these evils.","Again, it must not be of works, because if it should, then God would be the debtor, and we the creditor.","Now, much blasphemy would flow from hence; as, (1.)","God himself would not be his own to dispose of; for the inheritance being God, as well as his kingdom (for so it is written, 'heirs of God' (Rom 8:17)), himself, I say, must needs be our purchase.",(2.),"If so, then we have right to dispose of him, of his kingdom and glory, and all--'Be astonished, O heavens, at this!'","--for if he be ours by works, then he is ours of debt; if he be ours of debt, then he is ours by purchase; and then, again, if so, he is no longer his own, but ours, and at our disposal.","Therefore, for these reasons, were there sufficiency in our personal works to justify us, it would be even inconsistent with the being of God to suffer it.","So then, 'men are justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.'",Eleventh.,"'But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness' (Rom 4:5).","These words show how we must stand just in the sight of God from the curse of the law, both as it respecteth justification itself, as also the instrument or means that receiveth that righteousness which justifieth.",1.,"As for that righteousness that justifieth, it is not personal performances in us; for the person here justified stands, in that respect, as one that worketh not, as one that is ungodly.",2.,"As it respecteth the instrument that receiveth it, that faith, as in the point of justifying righteousness, will not work, but believe, but receive the works and righteousness of another; for works and faith in this are set in opposition.","He doth not work, he doth believe' (Gal 3:12).","He worketh not, but believeth on him who justifieth us, ungodly.","As Paul also saith in another place, The law is not of faith (Rom 10:5,6).","And again, Works saith on this wise; faith, far different.","The law saith, Do this, and live.","But the doctrine of faith saith, 'If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.","For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness,' &c. (Rom 10:9,10).",Object.,But faith is counted for righteousness.,Answ.,"True, but yet consider, that by faith we do oft understand the doctrine of remission of sins, as well as the act of believing.","But again; faith when it hath received the Lord Jesus, it hath done that which pleaseth God; therefore, the very act of believing is the most noble in the world; believing sets the crown upon the head of grace; it seals to the truth of the sufficiency of the righteousness of Christ, and giveth all the glory to God (John 3:33).","And therefore it is a righteous act; but Christ himself, he is the Righteousness that justifieth' (Rom 4:20,25).","Besides, faith is a relative, and hath its relation as such.","Its relation is the righteousness that justifieth, which is therefore called the righteousness of faith, or that with which faith hath to do (Rom 10:6).","Separate these two, and justification cannot be, because faith now wants his righteousness.","And hence it is you have so often such sayings as these--'He that believeth in me; he that believeth on him; believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved' (John 6:35,40).","Faith, then, as separate from Christ, doth nothing; nothing, neither with God nor man; because it wants its relative; but let it go to the Lord Jesus--let it behold him as dying, &c., and it fetches righteousness, and life, and peace out of the virtue of his blood, &c. (Acts 10:29,31,33).","Or rather, sees it there as sufficient for me to stand just thereby in the sight of Eternal Justice For him 'God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith [belief] in his blood,' with intent to justify him that believeth in Jesus (Rom 3:25,26).",Twelfth.,'Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man to whom God imputeth righteousness without works' (Rom 4:6).,"Did our adversaries understand this one text, they would not so boldly affirm, as they do, that the words, 'impute, imputed, imputeth, imputing,' &c., are not used in scripture but to express men really and personally to be that which is imputed unto them; for men are not really and personally faith, yet faith is imputed to men; nay, they are not really and personally sin, nor really and personally righteousness, yet these are imputed to men: so, then, both good things and bad may sometimes be imputed to men, yet themselves be really and personally neither.",But to come to the point: what righteousness hath that man that hath no works?,Doubtless none of his own; yet God imputeth righteousness to him.,"Yea, what works of that man doth God impute to him that he yet justifies as ungodly?","Further, He that hath works as to justification from the curse before God, not one of them is regarded of God; so, then, it mattereth not whether thou hast righteousness of thine own, or none.",'Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth righteousness without works.',"Man's blessedness, then, the blessedness of justification from the curse in the sight of God, lieth not in good works done by us, either before or after faith received, but in a righteousness which God imputeth without works; as we 'work not' as we 'are ungodly.'","'Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sin is covered' (v 7).","To forgive and to cover are acts of mercy, not the cause of our merit.","Besides, where sin is real, there can be no perfect righteousness; but the way of justification must be through perfect righteousness, therefore by another than our own, 'Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin' (v 8).","The first cause, then, of justification before God, dependeth upon the will of God, who will justify because he will; therefore the meritorious cause must also be of his own providing, else his will cannot herein be absolute; for if justification depend upon our personal performances, then not upon the will of God.","He may not have mercy upon whom he will, but on whom man's righteousness will give him leave.","But his will, not ours, must rule here; therefore his righteousness, and his only (Rom 9:15,18).","So, then, 'men are justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.'","Having passed over these few scriptures, I shall come to particular instances of persons who have been justified; and shall briefly touch their qualifications in the act of God's justifying them.","First, By the Old Testament types.","Second, By the New.",[First Position illustrated by Scripture types.],First.,By the Old [Testament types].,First.,"'Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them' (Gen 3:21).","In the beginning of this chapter you find these two persons reasoning with the serpent, the effect of which discourse was, they take of the forbidden fruit, and so break the command of God (vv 7-15).","This done, they hide themselves, and cover their nakedness with aprons.","But God finds out their sin, from the highest branch even to the roots thereof.",What followeth?,"Not one precept by which they should by works obtain the favour of God, but the promise of a Saviour; of which promise this twenty-first verse is a mystical interpretation: 'The Lord God made them coats of skins, and clothed them.'",Hence observe--1.,"That these coats were made, not before, but after they had made themselves aprons; a plain proof their aprons were not sufficient to hide their shame from the sight of God.",2.,"These coats were made, not of Adam's inherent righteousness, for that was lost before by sin, but of the skins of the slain, types of the death of Christ, and of the righteousness brought in thereby--'By whose stripes we are healed' (Isa 53).",[14] 3.,"This is further manifest; for the coats, God made them; and for the persons, God clothed them therewith; to show that as the righteousness by which we must stand just before God from the curse is a righteousness of Christ's performing, not of theirs; so he, not they, must put it on them also, for of God we are in Christ, and of God his righteousness is made ours (1 Cor 1:30).","But, I say, if you would see their antecedent qualifications, you find them under two heads--rebellion [and] hypocrisy.","Rebellion, in breaking God's command; hypocrisy, in seeking how to hide their faults from God.","Expound this by gospel language, and then it shows 'that men are justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.'",Second.,'The Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering' (Gen 4:4).,By these words we find the person first accepted: 'The Lord had respect unto Abel.',"And indeed, where the person is not first accepted, the offering will not be pleasing; the altar sanctifies the gift, and the temple sanctifieth the gold; so the person, the condition of the person, is that which makes the offering either pleasing or despising (Matt 23:16-21).","In the epistle to the Hebrews it is said, 'By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous' (Heb 11:4).","Righteous before he offered his gift, as his sacrifice testified; for God accepted of it.",'By faith he offered.',"Wherefore faith was precedent, or before he offered.",Now faith hath to do with God through Christ; not with him through our works of righteousness.,"Besides, Abel was righteous before he offered, before he did do good, otherwise God would not have testified of his gift.","'By faith he obtained witness that he was righteous,' for God approved of his gifts.","Now faith, I say, as to our standing quit before the Father, respects the promise of forgiveness of sins through the undertaking of the Lord Jesus.","Wherefore Abel's faith as to justifying righteousness before God looked not forward to what should be done by himself, but back to the promise of the seed of the woman, that was to destroy the power of hell, and 'to redeem them that were under the law' (Gen 3:15; Gal 4:4,5).","By this faith he shrouds himself under the promise of victory, and the merits of the Lord Jesus.","Now being there, God finds him righteous; and being righteous, 'he offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than his brother'; for Cain's person was not first accepted through the righteousness of faith going before, although he seemed foremost as to personal acts of righteousness (Gen 4).",Abel therefore was righteous before he did good works; but that could not be but alone through that respect God had to him for the sake of the Messias promised before (3:15).,"But the Lord's so respecting Abel presupposeth that at that time he stood in himself by the law a sinner, otherwise he needed not to be respected for and upon the account of another.","Yea, Abel also, forasmuch as he acted faith before he offered sacrifice, must thereby entirely respect the promise, which promise was not grounded upon a condition of works to be found in Abel, but in and for the sake of the seed of the woman, which is Christ; which promise he believed, and so took it for granted that this Christ should break the serpent's head--that is, destroy by himself the works of the devil; to wit, sin, death, the curse, and hell (Gal 4:4).","By this faith he stood before God righteous, because he had put on Christ; and being thus, he offered; by which act of faith God declared he was pleased with him, because he accepted of his sacrifice.",Third.,"'And the Lord said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger' (Gen 25:23).","These words, after Paul's exposition, are to be understood of justification in the sight of God, according to the purpose and decree of electing love, which had so determined long before, that one of these children should be received to eternal grace; but mark, not by works of righteousness which they should do, but 'before they had done either good or evil'; otherwise 'the purpose of God according to election,' not of works, but of him that calleth, 'could not stand,' but fall in pieces (Rom 9:10-12).","But none are received into eternal mercy but such as are just before the Lord by a righteousness that is complete; and Jacob having done no good, could by no means have that of his own, and therefore it must be by some other righteousness, 'and so himself be justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while a sinner in himself.'",Fourth.,"The same may be said concerning Solomon, whom the Lord loved with special love, as soon as born into the world; which he also confirmed with signal characters.","'He sent,' saith the Holy Ghost, 'by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called his name Jedidiah, because the Lord loved him (2 Sam 12:24,25).",[15] Was this love of God extended to him because of his personal virtues?,"No, verily; for he was yet an infant.",[16] He was justified then in the sight of God from the curse by another than his own righteousness.,Fifth.,"'And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live' (Eze 16:6).","The state of this people you have in the former verses described, both as to their rise and practice in the world (vv 1-5).",1.,As to their rise.,"Their original was the same with Canaan, the men of God's curse (Gen 9:25).",'Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan'; the same with other carnal men (Rom 3:9).,"'Thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite' (Eze 16:3).","Their condition, that is showed us by this emblem--(1.)",They had not been washed in water.,(2.),They had not been swaddled.,(3.),They had not been salted.,(4.),They brought filth with them into the world.,(5.),They lay stinking in their cradle.,(6.),They were without strength to help themselves.,Thus they appear and come by generation.,2.,"Again, as to their practice--(1.)",They polluted themselves in their own blood.,(2.),"They so continued till God passed by--'And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood';--'in thy blood, in thy blood'; it is doubled.","Thus we see they were polluted born, they continued in their blood till the day that the Lord looked upon them; polluted, I say, to the loathing of their persons, &c. Now this was the time of love--'And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live' (Eze 16:6).",Quest.,"But how could a holy God say, 'Live,' to such a sinful people?",Answ.,"Though they had nought but sin, yet he had love and righteousness.","He had love to pity them; righteousness to cover them--'Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love' (Eze 16:8).",What follows?,"(1) 'I spread my skirt over thee'; and (2) 'Covered thy nakedness'; yea, (3) 'I sware unto thee'; and (4) 'Entered into covenant with thee'; and (5) 'Thou becamest mine.'",My love pitied thee; my skirt covered thee.,Thus God delivered them from the curse in his sight.,"'Then I washed thee with water, after thou wast justified; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and anointed thee with oil' (v 9).","Sanctification, then, is consequential, justification goes before.","The Holy Ghost by this scripture setteth forth to the life, free grace to the sons of men, while they themselves are sinners.","I say, while they are unwashed, unswaddled, unsalted, but bloody sinners; for by these words, 'not washed, not salted, not swaddled,' he setteth forth their unsanctified state; yea, they were not only unsanctified, but also cast out, without pity, to the loathing of their persons; yea, 'no eye pitied them, to do any of these things for them'; no eye but his, whose glorious grace is unsearchable; no eye but his, who could look and love; all others looked and loathed; but blessed be God that hath passed by us in that day that we wallowed in our own blood; and blessed be God for the skirt of his glorious righteousness wherewith he covered us when we lay before him naked in blood.","It was when we were in our blood that he loved us; when we were in our blood he said, Live.","Therefore, 'men are justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.'",Sixth.,"'Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel' (Zech 3:3).",The standing of Joshua here is as men used to stand that were arraigned before a judge.,"'Joshua stood before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him' (v 1).",The same posture as Judas stood in when he was to be condemned.,"'Set thou,' said David, 'a wicked man over him; and let Satan stand at his right hand' (Psa 109:6).","Thus, therefore, Joshua stood.","Now Joshua was clothed, not with righteousness, but with filthy rags!","Sin upon him, and Satan by him, and this before the angel!",What must he do now?,Go away?,No; there he must stand!,Can he speak for himself?,Not a word; guilt had made him dumb!,(Isa 53:12).,Had he no place clean?,No; he was clothed with filthy garments!,"But his lot was to stand before Jesus Christ, that maketh intercession for transgressors.","'And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee' (Zech 3:2).",Thus Christ saveth from present condemnation those that be still in their sin and blood.,[17] But is he now quit?,"No; he standeth yet in filthy garments; neither can he, by aught that is in him, or done by him, clear himself from him.",How then?,"Why, the Lord clothes him with change of raiment.","The iniquities were his own, the raiment was the Lord's.","'This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord' (Isa 54:17).","We will not here discourse of Joshua's sin, what it was, or when committed; it is enough to our purpose that he was clothed with filthy garments; and that the Lord made a change with him, by causing his iniquity to pass from him, and by clothing him with change of raiment.",But what had Joshua antecedent to this glorious and heavenly clothing?,"The devil at his right hand to resist him, and himself in filthy garments.","'Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.","And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him.","And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment' (Zech 3: 3,4).",Second.,"But to pass [from] the Old Testament types, and to come to the New.",First.,"'And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.","Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things God hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee' (Mark 5:18,19).",The present state of this man is sufficiently declared in these particulars--1.,"He was possessed with a devil; with devils, with many; with a whole legion, which some say is six thousand, or thereabouts (Matt 8).",2.,"These devils had so the mastery of him as to drive him from place to place into the wilderness among the mountains, and so to dwell in the tombs among the dead (Luke 8).",3.,"He was out of his wits; he would cut his flesh, break his chains; nay, 'no man could tame him' (Mark 5:4-5).",4.,"When he saw Jesus, the devil in him, as being lord and governor there, cried out against the Lord Jesus (v 7).","In all this, what qualification shows itself as precedent to justification?","None but such as devils work, or as rank bedlams have.","Yet this poor man was dispossessed, taken into God's compassion, and was bid to show it to the world.","'Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee' (v 19); which last words, because they are added over and above his being dispossessed of the devils, I understand to be the fruit of electing love.","'I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion,' which blesseth us with the mercy of a justifying righteousness; and all this, as by this is manifest, without the least precedent qualification of ours.",Second.,"'And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both' (Luke 7:42).","The occasion of these words was, for that the Pharisee murmured against the woman that washed Jesus' feet, because 'she was a sinner'; for so said the Pharisee, and so saith the Holy Ghost (v 37).","But, saith Christ, Simon, I will ask thee a question, 'A certain man had two debtors: the one owed him five hundred pence, and the other fifty.","And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both' (v 38).",Hence I gather these conclusions--1.,That men that are wedded to their own righteousness understand not the doctrine of the forgiveness of sins.,This is manifested by the poor Pharisee; he objected against the woman because she was a sinner.,2.,"Let Pharisees murmur still, yet Christ hath pity and mercy for sinners.",3.,Yet Jesus doth not usually manifest mercy until the sinner hath nothing to pay.,"'And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly,' or freely, or heartily, 'forgave them both.'","If they had nothing to pay, then they were sinners; but he forgiveth no man but with respect to a righteousness; therefore that righteousness must be another's; for in the very act of mercy they are found sinners.","They had nothing but debt, nothing but sin, nothing to pay [with].","Then they were 'justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.'","So, then, 'men are justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.'",Third.,"'And when he saw their faith, he said unto the man, Thy sins are forgiven thee' (Luke 5:20).","This man had not righteousness to stand just before God withal, for his sins as yet remained unforgiven; wherefore, seeing guilt remained until Christ remitted him, he was discharged while ungodly.","And observe it, the faith here mentioned is not to be reckoned so much the man's, as the faith of them that brought him; neither did it reach to the forgiveness of sins, but to the miracle of healing; yet this man, in this condition, had his sins forgiven him.","But again; set the case, the faith was only his, as it was not, and that it reached to the doctrine of forgiveness, yet it did it without respect to righteousness in himself; for guilt lay still upon him, he had now his sins forgiven him.",But this act of grace was a surprisal; it was unlooked for.,'I am found of them that sought me not' (Isa 65:1).,"They came for one thing, he gave them another; they came for a cure upon his body, but, to their amazement, he cured first his soul.",'Thy sins are forgiven thee.',"Besides, to have his sins forgiven betokeneth an act of grace; but grace and works as to this are opposite (Rom 11:6).","Therefore 'men are justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.'",Fourth.,"'Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son' (Luke 15:21).","What this man was is sufficiently declared in verse 13, &c. As 1.","A riotous spender of all--of time, talent, body, and soul.",2.,"He added to this his rebellion, great contempt of his father's house--he joined himself to a stranger, and became an associate with swine (vv 15,17).","At last, indeed, he came to himself.",But then observe--(1.),He sought not justification by personal performances of his own; (2.),Neither did he mitigate his wickedness; (3.),"Nor excuse himself before his father; but first resolveth to confess his sin; and coming to his father, did confess it, and that with aggravating circumstances.",'I have sinned against heaven; I have sinned against thee; I am no more worthy to be called thy son' (v 18).,Now what he said was true or false.,"If true, then he had not righteousness.","If false, he could not stand just in the sight of his father by virtue of his own performances.","And, indeed, the sequel of the parable clears it.","His 'father said to his servant, Bring forth the best robe,' the justifying righteousness, 'and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet' (v 22).","This best robe, then, being in the father's house, was not in the prodigal's heart; neither stayed the father for further qualifications, but put it upon him as he was, surrounded with sin and oppressed with guilt.","Therefore 'men are justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.'",Fifth.,'For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost' (Luke 19:10).,"The occasion of these words was, for that the Pharisees murmured because 'Jesus was gone to be guest to one that was a sinner,' yea, a sinner of the publicans, and are most fitly applied to the case in hand.","For though Zaccheus climbed the tree, yet Jesus Christ found him first, and called him down by his name; adding withal, 'For to-day I must abide at thy house' (v 5); which being opened by verse 9, is as much as to say, I am come to be thy salvation.","Now this being believed by Zaccheus, 'he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully.'","And not only so, but to declare to all the simplicity of his faith, and that he unfeignedly accepted of this word of salvation, he said unto the Lord, and that before all present, 'Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation,' a supposition intimating an affirmative, 'I restore him fourfold.","'[18] This being thus, Christ doubleth his comfort, saying to him also, and that before the people, 'This day is salvation come to this house.'","Then, by adding the next words, he expounds the whole of the matter, 'For I am come to seek and save that which was lost'; to seek it till I find it, to save it when I find it.","He finds them that sought him not (Rom 10:20); and saith, Zaccheus, Behold me!",to a people that asked not after him.,"So, then, seeing Jesus findeth this publican first, preaching salvation to him before he came down from the tree, it is evident he received this as he was a sinner; from which faith flowed his following words and works as a consequence.",Sixth.,"'Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise' (Luke 23:43).","This was spoken to the thief upon the cross, who had lived in wickedness all his days; neither had he so much as truly repented--no, not till he came to die; nay, when he first was hanged he then fell to railing on Christ; for though Luke leaves it out, beginning but at his conversion; yet by Matthew's relating the whole tragedy, we find him at first as bad as the other (Matt 27:44).","This man, then, had no moral righteousness, for he had lived in the breach of the law of God.","Indeed, by faith he believed Christ to be King, and that when dying with him.",But what was this to a personal performing the commandments?,or of restoring what he had oft taken away?,"Yea, he confesseth his death to be just for his sin; and so leaning upon the mediation of Christ he goeth out of the world.","Now he that truly confesseth and acknowledgeth his sin, acknowledgeth also the curse to be due thereto from the righteous hand of God.","So then, where the curse of God is due, that man wanteth righteousness.","Besides, he that makes to another for help, hath by that condemned his own, had he any, of utter insufficiency.","But all these did this poor creature; wherefore he must stand 'just from the law in the sight of God, while sinful in himself.'",Seventh.,"'Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?'",(Acts 9:6).,What wilt thou have me to do?,Ignorance is here set forth to the full.,"Paul hitherto knew not Jesus, neither what he would have him to do; yet a mighty man for the law of works, and for zeal towards God according to that.","Thus you see that he neither knew that Christ was Lord, nor what was his mind and will--'I did it ignorantly, in unbelief' (1 Tim 1:13-15).","I did not know him; I did not believe he was to save us; I thought I must be saved by living righteously, by keeping the law of God.","This thought kept me ignorant of Jesus, and of justification from the curse by him.",Poor Saul!,"how many fellows hast thou yet alive!--every man zealous of the law of works, yet none of them know the law of grace; each of them seeking for life by doing the law, when life is to be had by nought but believing in Jesus Christ.",Eighth.,"'Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved' (Acts 16:31).","A little before, we find Paul and Silas in the stocks for preaching of Jesus Christ; in the stocks, in the inward prison, by the hands of a sturdy jailer; but at midnight, while Paul and his companion sang praises to God, the foundations of the prison shook, and every man's bands were loosed.","Now the jailer being awakened by the noise of this shaking, and supposing he had lost his prisoners, drew his sword, with intent to kill himself; 'But Paul cried out, Do thyself no harm; for we are all here.","Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, and brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?'",In all this relation here is not aught that can justify the jailer.,"For, 1.","His whole life was idolatry, cruelty, and enmity to God.","Yea, 2.","Even now, while the earthquake shook the prison, he had murder in his heart--yea, and in his intentions too; murder, I say, and that of a high nature, even to have killed his own body and soul at once.","[19] Well, 3.","When he began to shake under the fears of everlasting burnings, yet then his heart was wrapped up in ignorance as to the way of salvation by Jesus Christ: 'What must I do to be saved?'","He knew not what; no, not he.","His condition, then, was this: he neither had righteousness to save him, nor knew he how to get it.","Now, what was Paul's answer?","Why, 'Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,' look for righteousness in Christ, 'and then thou shalt be saved.'","This, then, still holdeth true, 'men are justified from the curse, in the sight of God, whilst sinners in themselves.'",[Reasons for the first position drawn from the texts.],THIRD.,"I should now come to the second conclusion, viz., that this can be done by no other righteousness than that long ago performed by, and remaining with, the person of Christ.","But before I speak to that, I will a little further press this, by urging for it several reasons.","The First Reason.--Men must be justified from the curse while sinners in themselves, because by nature all are under sin--'All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.","He hath concluded all in unbelief; he hath concluded all under sin' (Rom 3:23, 11:32; Gal 3:22).","Now having sinned, they are in body and soul defiled, and become an unclean thing.","Wherefore, whatever they touch, with an intent to work out righteousness thereby, they defile that also (Titus 1:15; Lev 15:11; Isa 64:6).","And hence, as I have said, all the righteousness they seek to accomplish is but as a menstruous cloth and filthy rags; therefore they are sinners still.'","Indeed, to some men's thinking, the Pharisee is holier than the Publican; but in God's sight, in the eyes of Divine justice, they stand alike condemned.",'All have sinned'; there is the poison!,"Therefore, as to God, without Christ, all throats are an open sepulchre (Matt 23:27; Rom 3:13).","The world in general is divided into two sorts of sinners--the open profane, and the man that seeks life by the works of the law.",The profane is judged by all; but the other by a few.,Oh!,but God judgeth him.,1.,"For a hypocrite; because that notwithstanding he hath sinned, he would be thought to be good and righteous.","And hence it is that Christ calls such kind of holy ones, 'Pharisees, hypocrites!",Pharisees hypocrites!',because by their gay outside they deceived those that beheld them.,"But, saith he, God sees your hearts; you are but like painted sepulchres, within you are full of dead men's bones (Prov 30:12; Matt 23:27-30; Luke 11:26, 16:15).",Such is the root from whence flows all their righteousness.,But doth the blind Pharisee think his state is such?,"No; his thoughts of himself are far otherwise--'God, I thank thee,' saith he, 'I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this publican' (Luke 18:11,12).","Aye, but still God judgeth him for a hypocrite.",2.,"God judgeth him for one that spurneth against Christ, even by every such work he doth.","And hence it is, when Paul was converted to Jesus Christ, that he calls the righteousness he had before, madness, blasphemy, injury; because what he did to save himself by works was in direct opposition to grace by Jesus Christ (Phil 3:7,8; Acts 22:3,4, 26:4; 1 Tim 1:14,15).","Behold, then, the evil that is in a man's own righteousness!",(1.),It curseth and condemneth the righteousness of Christ.,(2.),It blindeth the man from seeing his misery.,(3.),It hardeneth his heart against his own salvation.,3.,"But again, God judgeth such, for those that condemn him of foolishness--'The preaching of the cross,' that is, Christ crucified, 'is to them that perish foolishness' (1 Cor 1:18,23).","What, saith the merit-monger, will you look for life by the obedience of another man?","Will you trust to the blood that was shed upon the cross, that run down to the ground, and perished in the dust?","Thus deridingly they scoff at, stumble upon, and are taken in the gin that attends the gospel; not to salvation, but to their condemnation, because they have condemned the Just, that they might justify their own filthy righteousness (Isa 8:14).","But, I say, if all have sinned, if all are defiled, if the best of a man's righteousness be but madness, blasphemy, injury; if for their righteousness they are judged hypocrites, condemned as opposers of the gospel, and as such have counted God foolish for sending his Son into the world; then must the best of 'men be justified from the curse in the sight of God while sinners in themselves'; because they still stand guilty in the sight of God, their hearts are also still filthy infected--'Though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before ME, saith the Lord God' (Jer 2:22).",It stands marked still before God.,"So, then, what esteem soever men have of the righteousness of the world, yet God accounts it horrible wickedness, and the greatest enemy that Jesus hath.","Wherefore, this vine is the vine of Sodom; these clusters are the clusters of Gomorrah; these grapes are grapes of gall; these clusters are bitter, they are the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps (Matt 3:7; 23).","No marvel, then, if John in his ministry gives the first rebuke and jostle to such, still calling them serpents and vipers, and concluding it is almost impossible they should escape the damnation of hell; for of all sin, man's own righteousness, in special, bids defiance to Jesus Christ.","The Second Reason.--A second reason why men must stand just in the sight of God from the curse, while sinners in themselves, is, because of the exactions of the law.","For were it granted that men's good works arose from a holy root, and were perfect in their kind, yet the demand of the law--for that is still beyond them--would leave them sinners before the justice of God.","And hence it is that holy men stand just in the sight of God from the curse; yet dare not offer their gifts by the law, but through Jesus Christ; knowing that not only their persons, but their spiritual service also, would else be rejected of the heavenly Majesty (1 Peter 2:5; Rev 7:14-16; Heb 8:7,8).","[20] For the law is itself so perfectly holy and good as not to admit of the least failure, either in the matter or manner of obedience--'Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them' (Gal 3:10).","For they that shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, are guilty of all, and convicted of the law as transgressors (James 2:9,10).","'Tribulation,' therefore, 'and anguish, upon every soul of man that doth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile' (Rom 2:9).","And observe, the law leaveth thee not to thy choice, when, or when not, to begin to keep it; but requireth thy obedience so soon as concerned, exactly, both as to the matter and manner, and that before thou hast sinned against it; for the first sin breaks the law.","Now, if thou sinnest before thou beginnest to do, thou art found by the law a transgressor, and so standest by that convicted of sin; so, then, all thy after-acts of righteousness are but the righteousness of a sinner, of one whom the law hath condemned already (John 3:18).","'The law is spiritual, but thou art carnal, sold under sin' (Rom 7:14).","Besides, the law being absolutely perfect, doth not only respect the matter and manner as to outward acts, but also the rise and root, the heart, from whence they flow; and an impediment there spoils all, were the executive part never so good--'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with ALL thy heart, with ALL thy soul, with ALL thy mind, and with ALL thy strength' (Mark 12:30).","Mark the repetition, with all, with all, with all, with all; with all thy heart, with all thy soul, in all things, at all times, else thou hadst as good do nothing.",But 'every imagination of the thought of the heart of man is only evil continually' (Gen 6:5).,"The margin hath it, 'the whole imagination, the purposes, and desires'; so that a good root is here wanting.","'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?'",(Jer 17:9).,"What thoughts, words, or actions can be clean, sufficiently to answer a perfect law that flows from this original?",It is impossible.,"'Men must therefore be justified from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves.'",But further yet to open the case.,There are several things that make it impossible that a man should stand just in the sight of God but while sinful in himself.,1.,"Because the law under which he at present stands, holds him under the dominion of sin; for sin by the law hath dominion over all that are under the law (Rom 6:14).","Dominion, I say, both as to guilt and filth.","Guilt hath dominion over him, because he is under the curse: and filth, because the law giveth him no power, neither can he by it deliver his soul.","And for this cause it is that it is called beggarly, weak, unprofitable; imposing duty, but giving no strength (Gal 3:2, 4:9).","Expecting the duty should be complete, yet bendeth not the heart to do the work; to do it, I say, as is required (Rom 8:3).","And hence it is again that it is called a 'voice of words' (Heb 12:19);[21] for as words that are barely such are void of spirit and quickening life, so are the impositions of the law of works.","Thus far, therefore, the man remains a sinner.","But, 2.","The law is so far from giving life or strength to do it, that it doth quite the contrary.",[22] (1.),"It weakeneth, it discourageth, and dishearteneth the sinner, especially when it shows itself in its glory; for then it is the ministration of death, and killeth all the world.","When Israel saw this, they fled from the face of God; they could not endure that which was commanded (Exo 20:18,19); yea, so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, 'I exceedingly fear and quake' (Heb 12:20,21).","Yea, almost forty years after, Moses stood amazed to find himself and Israel yet alive, 'Did ever people,' said he, 'hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?'","(Deut 4:32,33).",Alas!,"he who boasteth himself in the works of the law, he doth not hear the law; when that speaks, it shakes Mount Sinai, and writeth death upon all faces, and makes the church itself cry out, A mediator!","else we die (Exo 20:19; Deut 5:25-27, 18:15,19).",(2.),"It doth not only thus discourage, but abundantly increaseth every sin.",Sin takes the advantage of being by the law; the motions of sin are by the law.,"Where no law is, there is no transgression (Rom 4:15, 7:5).","Sin takes an occasion to live by the law: 'When the commandment came, sin revived; for without the law, sin was dead' (Rom 7:8,9).","Sin takes an occasion to multiply by the law: 'The law entered, that the offence might abound' (Rom 5:20).",'And the strength of sin is the law' (1 Cor 15:56).,"'That sin by the commandment might become' outrageous, 'exceeding sinful' (Rom 7:13).",'What shall we say then?,Is the law sin?,God forbid.,"Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.","But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.","For without the law, sin was dead' (Rom 7:7,8) These things, then, are not infused or operated by the law from its own nature or doctrine, but are occasioned by the meeting of, and having to do with, a thing directly opposite.","'The law is spiritual, I am carnal'; therefore every imposition is rejected and rebelled against.","Strike a steel against a flint, and the fire flies about you; strike the law against a carnal heart, and sin appears, sin multiplies, sin rageth, sin is strengthened!","And hence ariseth all these doubts, murmurings, and sinful complainings that are found in the hearts of the people of God; they have too much to do with the law; the law of works is now in the conscience, imposing duty upon the carnal part.","This is the reason of the noise that you hear, and of the sin that you see, and of the horror that you feel in your own souls when tempted.",But to pass this digression.,"The law, then, having to do with carnal men, by this they become worse sinners than before; for their heart now recoileth desperately, opposeth blasphemously; it giveth way to despair; and then to conclude there is no hope for hereafter; and so goeth on in a sordid, ungodly course of life, till his time is come to die and be damned, unless a miracle of grace prevent.","From all this I conclude, that 'a man cannot stand just from the curse, in the sight of God but while sinful in himself.'","But, 3.","As the law giveth neither strength nor life to keep it, so it neither giveth nor worketh repentance unto life if thou break it.","Do this and live, break it and die; this is the voice of the law.","All the repentance that such men have, it is but that of themselves, the sorrow of the world, that endeth in death, as Cain's and Judas' did, even such a repentance as must be repented of either here or in hell-fire (2 Cor 7:10).",4.,"As it giveth none, so it accepteth none of them that are under the law (Gal 5:4).","Sin and die, is for ever its language; there is no middle way in the law; they must bear their judgment, whosoever they be, that stand and fall to the law.","Therefore Cain was a vagabond still, and Judas hangeth himself; their repentance could not save them, they fell headlong under the law.",The law stays no man from the due reward of his deeds; it hath no ears to hear nor heart to pity its penitent ones (Gen 4:9-11; Matt 27:3).,5.,"By the law, God will show no mercy; for, 'I will be merciful to their unrighteousness,' is the tenor of another covenant (Heb 8:9,10,12).","But by the law I regard them not, saith the Lord.","For, 6.","All the promises annexed to the law are, by the first sin, null and void.","Though, then, a man should live a thousand years twice told, and all that while fulfil the law, yet having sinned first, he is not at all the better.","Our legalists, then, begin to talk too soon of having life by the law; let them first begin without sin, and so throughout continue to death, and then if God will save them, not by Christ, but works, contrary to the covenant of grace, they may hope to go to heaven.",7.,"But, lastly, to come close to the point.","Thou hast sinned; the law now calls for passive as well as active obedience; yea, great contentedness in all thou sufferest for thy transgressing against the law.","So, then, wilt thou live by the law?","Fulfil it, then, perfectly till death, and afterwards go to hell and be damned, and abide there till the law and curse for thy sin be satisfied for; and then, but not till then, thou shalt have life by the law.","Tell me, now, you that desire to be under the law, can you fulfil all the commands of the law, and after answer all its demands?",Can you grapple with the judgment of God?,Can you wrestle with the Almighty?,"Are you stronger than he that made the heavens, and that holdeth angels in everlasting chains?","'Can thine heart endure, or can thy hands be strong in the day that I shall deal with thee?","I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it' (Eze 22:14).","O, it cannot be!",'These must go away into everlasting punishment' (Matt 25:46).,"So, then, men must stand just from the curse, in the sight of God, while sinners in themselves, or not at all.",Objection [to the second reason].,"But the apostle saith, 'That the doers of the law shall be justified' (Rom 2).","Plainly intimating that, notwithstanding all you say, some by doing the law may stand just before God thereby; and if so, then Christ fulfilled it for us but as our example.",Answer.,"The consequences are not true; for by these words, 'The doers of the law shall be justified,' there is no more proof of a possibility of saving thyself by the law than there is by these: 'For by the works of the law shall no man living be justified in his sight' (Gal 2:16).","The intent, then, of the text objected, is not to prove a possibility of man's salvation by the law, but to insinuate rather an impossibility, by asserting what perfections the law requireth.","And were I to argue against the pretended sufficiency of man's own righteousness, I would choose to frame mine argument upon such a place as this--'The hearers of the law are not just before God'; therefore the breakers of the law are not just before God; not just, I say, by the law; but all have sinned and broken the law; therefore none by the law are just before God.","For if all stand guilty of sin by the law, then that law that judgeth them sinners cannot justify them before God.","And what if the apostle had said, 'Blessed are they that continue in all things,' instead of pronouncing a curse for the contrary, the conclusion had been the same; for where the blessing is pronounced, he is not the better that breaks the condition; and where the curse is pronounced, he is not the worse that keeps it.","But neither doth the blessing nor curse in the law intend a supposition that men may be just by the law, but rather to show the perfection of the law, and that though a blessing be annexed thereto, no man by it can obtain that blessing; for not the hearers of the law are justified before God, but the doers, when they do it, shall be justified.","None but doers can by it be just before God: but none do the law, no, not one, therefore none by it can stand just before God (Rom 3:10,11).","And whereas it is said Christ kept the law as our example, that we by keeping it might get to heaven, as he; it is false, as before was showed--'He is the end of the law,' or, hath perfectly finished it, 'for righteousness to every one that believeth' (Rom 10:4).","But a little to travel with this objection; no man can keep the moral law as Christ, unless he be first without sin, as Christ; unless he be God and man, as Christ.","And again; Christ cannot be our pattern in keeping the law for life, because of the disproportion that is between him and us; for if we do it as he, when yet we are weaker than he; what is this but to out-vie, outdo, and go beyond Christ?","Wherefore we, not he, have our lives exemplary: exemplary, I say, to him; for who doth the greatest work, they that take it in hand in full strength, as Christ; or he that takes it in hand in weakness, as we?","Doubtless the last, if he fulfils it as Christ.","So, then, by this doctrine, while we call ourselves his scholars, we make ourselves indeed the masters.","But I challenge all the angels in heaven, let them but first sin as we have done, to fulfil the law, as Christ, if they can!","But again; if Christ be our pattern in keeping the law for life from the curse before God, then Christ fulfilled the law for himself; if so, he was imperfect before he fulfilled it.","And how far short this is of blasphemy let sober Christians judge; for the righteousness he fulfilled was to justify from sin; but if it was not to justify us from ours, you know what remaineth (Dan 9:26; Isa 53:8-10).",But when must we conclude we have kept the law?,"Not when we begin, because we have sinned first; nor when we are in the middle, for we may afterwards miscarry.",But what if a man in this his progress hath one sinful thought?,"I query, is it possible to come up to the pattern for justification with God?","If yea, then Christ had such; if no, then who can fulfil the law as he?","But should I grant that which is indeed impossible--namely, that thou art justified by the law; what then?",Art thou now in the favour of God?,"No, thou art fallen by this thy perfection, from the love and mercy of God: 'Whosoever of you are justified by the law are fallen from grace' (Gal 5:4).","He speaks not this to them that are doing, but to such as think they have done it, and shows that the blessing that these have got thereby is to fall from the favour of God.","Being fallen from grace, Christ profits them nothing, and so they still stand debtors to do the whole law.","So, then, they must not be saved by God's mercy, nor Christ's merits, but alone by the works of the law!","But what should such men do in that kingdom that comes by gift, where grace and mercy reigns?","Yea, what should they do among that company that are saved alone by grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ?",Let them go to that kingdom that God hath prepared for them that are fallen from grace.,'Cast out the bond-woman and her son; for he shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman' and of promise (Gal 4:30).,[23] But to pass this objection.,"Before I come to the next reason, I shall yet for the further clearing of this, urge these scriptures more.",[Further scriptures to prove the second reason.],1.,"The first is that in Galatians 3:10, 'As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse.'",Behold how boldly Paul asserts it!,"And observe it, he saith not here, so many as sin against the law--though that be true--but, 'As many as are of the works of the law.'","But what, then, are the works of the law?","Not whoredom, murder, theft, and the like; but works that are holy and good, the works commanded in the ten commandments, as to love God, abhor idols, reverence the name of God, keeping the Sabbath, honouring thy parents, abstaining from adultery, murder, theft, false-witness, and not to covet what is thy neighbour's--these are the works of the law.","Now he, saith Paul, that is of these is under the curse of God.",But what is it then to be of these?,"Why, to be found in the practice of them, and there resting; this is the man that is under the curse: not because the works of the law are wicked in themselves, but because the man that is in the practice of them comes short of answering the exactness of them, and therefore dies for his imperfections (Rom 2:17).",2.,"The second scripture is that of the eleventh verse of the same chapter, 'But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident; for, The just shall live by faith.'","These words, 'the just shall live by faith,' are taken out of the Old Testament, and are thrice used by this apostle in the New.",(1.),To show that nothing of the gospel can be apprehended but by faith: 'For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith.',"'As it is written, The just shall live by faith' (Rom 1:17).",(2.),To show that the way to have relief and succour under temptation is then to live by faith: 'Now the just shall live by faith' (Heb 10:38) (3.),"But in this of the Galatians it is urged to show that how holy and just soever men be in themselves, yet as such they are dead, and condemned to death by the law before God.","But that no man is justified by the law, in the sight of God, is evident; for, 'the just shall live by faith.'","The word 'just,' therefore, in this place in special, respecteth a man that is just, or that so esteems himself by the law, and is here considered in a double capacity; first, what he is before men; secondly, what he is before God.",(1.),"As he stands before men, he is just by the law; as Paul before his conversion (Phil 3:4).",(2.),"As he stands in the sight of God; so, without the faith of Christ, he cannot be just, as is evident; for 'the just shall live,' not by his justice or righteousness by the law.",This is the true intent of this place.,"Because they carry with them a supposition that the just here intended may be excluded life, he falling within the rejection asserted within the first part of the verse.","No man is just by the law in the sight of God; for 'the just shall live by faith': his justice cannot make him live, he must live by the faith of Christ.","[24] Again, the words are a reason dissuasive, urged to put a stop to those that are seeking life by the law; as if the apostle had said, Ye Galatians!",what are you doing?,Would you be saved by keeping the law?,Would you stand just before God thereby?,"Do you not hear the prophets, how they press faith in Jesus, and life by faith in him?","Come, I will reason with you, by way of supposition.","Were it granted that you all loved the law, yet that for life, will avail you nothing; for, 'the just shall live by faith.'","Were it granted that you kept the law, and that no man on earth could accuse you; were you therefore just before God?",No; neither can you live by works before him; for 'the just shall live by faith.',Why not live before him?,"Because when we have done our best, and are applauded of all the world for just, yet then God sees sin in our hearts: 'He putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight' (Job 15:15, 4:18).","There is then a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, if he want the faith of Christ, for that no man is justified by the law, in the sight of God, is evident; for, 'the just shall live by faith'; and the law is not of faith.",3.,"The third Scripture is this--'We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified' (Gal 2:15,16).","These words are the result of the experienced Christians in the primitive times; yea, of those among them that had given up themselves before to the law, to get life and heaven thereby; the result, I say, of believing Jews--We who are Jews by nature.",But how are they distinguished from the Gentiles?,"Why, they are such that rest in the law, and make their boast of God; that know his will, and approve the things that are excellent; that are guides to the blind, and a light to them that are in darkness; that are instructors of the foolish, teachers of babes, and which have the form of knowledge, and of the truth of the law (Rom 2:17-19).","How far these attained we find by that of the Pharisee--I pray, I fast, I give tithes of all (Luke 18:11,12); and by the young man in the gospel--'All these have I kept from my youth up'; and by that of Paul--'Touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless' (Phil 3:6).","This was the Jew by nature, to do and trust in this.","[25] Now these attaining afterwards the sound knowledge of sin, the depravedness of nature, and the exactions of the law, fled from the command of the law to the Lord Jesus for life.","'We knowing' is--We that are taught of God, and that have found it by sad experience, we, even we, have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law.","Surely, if righteousness had come by the law, Paul and the Jews had found it, they being by many privileges far better than the sinners of the Gentiles; but these, when they received the word of the gospel, even these now fly to Christ from the law, that they might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law.",To conclude this.,"If righteous men, through the knowledge of the gospel, are made to leave the law of God, as despairing of life thereby, surely righteousness is not to be found in the law; I mean that which can justify thee before God from the curse who livest and walkest in the law.","I shall, therefore, end this second reason with what I have said before--'Men must be justified from the curse in the sight of God while sinful in themselves.'","The Third Reason.--Another reason why not one under heaven can be justified by the law, or by his own personal performances to it, is, because since sin was in the world, God hath rejected the law and the works thereof for life (Rom 7:10).","It is true, before man had sinned, it was ordained to be unto life; but since, and because of sin, the God of love gave the word of grace.","Take the law, then, as God hath established it; to wit, to condemn all flesh (Gal 3:21); and then there is room for the promise and the law, the one to kill, the other to heal; and so the law is not against the promises; but make the law a justifier, and faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect (Rom 4:14); and the everlasting gospel, by so doing, thou endeavourest to root out of the world.","Methinks, since it hath pleased God to reject the law and the righteousness thereof for life, such dust and ashes as we are should strive to consent to his holy will, especially when in the room of this [covenant] of works there is established a better covenant, and that upon better promises.","The Lord hath rejected the law, for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof; for, finding fault with them of the law, 'The days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel,' &c. (Heb 8:8).","Give God leave to find fault with us, and to condemn our personal performances to death, as to our justification before him thereby; let him do it, I say; and the rather, because he doth by the gospel present us with a better.","And certainly, if ever he be pleased with us, it will be when he findeth us in that righteousness that is of his own appointing.",[Six things that incline the heart to seek to the law for life.],To conclude.,"Notwithstanding all that hath or can be said, there are six things that have great power with the heart to bend it to seek life before God by the law; of all which I would caution that soul to beware, that would have happiness in another world.",First.,"Take heed thou be not made to seek to the law for life, because of that name and majesty of God which thou findest upon the doctrine of the law (Exo 20:1).","God indeed spake all the words of the law, and delivered them in that dread and majesty to men that shook the hearts of all that heard it.","Now this is of great authority with some, even to seek for life and bliss by the law.","'We know,' said some, 'that God spake to Moses' (John 9:29).",And Saul rejected Christ even of zeal towards God (Acts 22:3).,What zeal?,"Zeal towards God according to the law, which afterwards he left and rejected, because he had found out a better way.","The life that he once lived, it was by the law; but afterwards, saith he, 'The life which I now live,' it is by faith, 'by the faith of Jesus Christ' (Gal 2:20).","So that though the law was the appointment of God, and had also his name and majesty upon it, yet now he will not live by the law.","Indeed, God is in the law, but yet only as just and holy, not as gracious and merciful; so he is only in Jesus Christ.","'The law,' the word of justice, 'was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ' (John 1:17).","Wherefore, whatever of God thou findest in the law, yet seeing grace and mercy is not there, let neither the name of God, nor that majesty that thou findest of him in the law, prevail with thee to seek life by all the holy commandments of the law.",Second.,"Take heed that the law, by taking hold on thy conscience, doth not make thee seek life by the law (Rom 2:13-15).",The heart of man is the seat of the law.,"This being so, the understanding and conscience must needs be in danger of being bound by the law.","Man is a law unto himself, and showeth that the works of the law are written in his heart.","Now, the law being thus nearly related to man, it easily takes hold of the understanding and conscience; by which hold, if it be not quickly broken off by the promise and grace of the gospel, it is captivated to the works of the law; for conscience is such a thing, that if it once be possessed with a doctrine, yea, though but with the doctrine of an idol, it will cleave so fast thereto that nothing but a hand from heaven can loosen it; and if it be not loosed, no gospel can be there embraced (1 Cor 8:7).","Conscience is Little-ease, if men resist it, whether it be rightly or wrongly informed.","[26] How fast, then, will it hold when it knows it cleaves to the law of God!","Upon this account, the condition of the unbeliever is most miserable; for not having faith in the gospel of grace, through which is tendered the forgiveness of sins, they, like men a-drowning, hold fast that they have found; which being the law of God, they follow it; but because righteousness flies from them, they at last are found only accursed and condemned to hell by the law.","Take heed, therefore, that thy conscience be not entangled by the law (Rom 9:31,32).",Third.,Take heed of fleshly wisdom.,Reasoning suiteth much with the law.,"'I thought verily that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus,' and so to have sought for life by the law; my reason told me so.","For thus will reason say: Here is a righteous law, the rule of life and death; besides, what can be better than to love God, and my neighbour as myself?","Again; God hath thus commanded, and his commands are just and good; therefore, doubtless, life must come by the law.","Further, to love God and keep the law are better than to sin and break it; and seeing men lost heaven by sin, how should they get it again but by working righteousness?","Besides, God is righteous, and will therefore bless the righteous.",O the holiness of the law!,"It mightily swayeth with reason when a man addicteth himself to religion; the light of nature teacheth that sin is not the way to heaven; and seeing no word doth more condemn sin than the words of the ten commandments, it must needs be, therefore, the most perfect rule for holiness; wherefore, saith reason, the safest way to life and glory is to keep myself close to the law.",But a little here to correct.,"Though the law indeed be holy, yet the mistake as to the matter in hand is as wide as the east from the west; for therefore the law can do thee no good, because it is holy and just; for what can he that hath sinned expect from a law that is holy and just?",Nought but condemnation.,"Let them lean to it while they will, 'there is one that accuseth you,' saith Christ, 'even Moses, in whom you trust' (John 5:45).",Fourth.,"Man's ignorance of the gospel suiteth well with the doctrine of the law; they, through their being ignorant of God's righteousness, fall in love with that (Rom 10:1-4).","Yea, they do not only suit, but, when joined in act, the one strengtheneth the other; that is, the law strengtheneth our blindness, and bindeth the veil more fast about the face of our souls.","The law suiteth much our blindness of mind; for until this day remains the veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament; especially in the reading of that which was written and engraven on stones; to wit, the ten commandments, that perfect rule for holiness; which veil was done away in Christ (2 Cor 3:15,16).","But 'even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is over their hearts'; they are blinded by the duties enjoined by the law from the sight and hopes of forgiveness of sins by grace.","'Nevertheless when IT,' the heart, 'shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.'","The law, then, doth veil the heart from Christ, and holds the man so down to doing and working for the kingdom of heaven, that he quite forgets the forgiveness of sins by mercy through Christ.",Now this veiling or blinding by the law is occasioned-- 1.,By reason of the contrariety of doctrine that is in the law to that which was in the gospel.,"The law requireth obedience to all its demands upon pain of everlasting burnings; the gospel promiseth forgiveness of sins to him that worketh not, but believeth.",Now the heart cannot receive both these doctrines; it must either let go doing or believing.,"If it believe, it is dead to doing; if it be set to doing for life, it is dead to believing.","[27] Besides, he that shall think both to do and believe for justification before God from the curse, he seeks for life but as it were by the law, he seeks for life but as it were by Christ; and he being not direct in either, shall for certain be forsaken of either.",Wherefore?,"Because he seeks it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law' (Rom 9:32).",2.,"The law veils and blinds by that guilt and horror for sin that seizeth the soul by the law; for guilt, when charged close upon the conscience, is attended with such aggravations, and that with such power and evidence, that the conscience cannot hear, nor see, nor feel anything else but that.","When David's guilt for murder and blood did roar by the law in his conscience, notwithstanding he knew much of the grace of the gospel, he could hear nothing else but terror, the sound of blood; the murder of Uriah was the only noise that he heard; wherefore he crieth to God that he would make him hear the gospel.","'Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice' (Psa 51:8).","And as he could not hear, so neither could he see; the law had struck him deaf and blind.","'I am,' saith he, 'not able to look up'; not up to Christ for mercy.","As if David had said, O Lord, the guilt of sin, which is by the law, makes such a noise and horror in my conscience, that I can neither hear nor see the word of peace unless it is spoken with a voice from heaven!",The serpents that bit the people in the days of old were types of guilt and sin (Num 21:6).,"Now, these were fiery serpents, and such as, I think, could fly (Isa 14:29).","Wherefore, in my judgment, they stung the people about their faces, and so swelled up their eyes, which made it the more difficult for them to look up to the brazen serpent, which was the type of Christ (John 3:14).",Just so doth sin by the law do now.,"It stings the soul, the very face of the soul, which is the cause that looking up to Jesus, or believing in him, is so difficult a task in time of terror of conscience.",[28] 3.,"This is not only so at present, but so long as guilt is on the conscience, so long remains the blindness; for guilt standing before the soul, the grace of God is intercepted, even as the sun is hid from the sight of mine eyes by the cloud that cometh between.","'My sin,' said David, 'is ever before me,' and so kept other things out of his sight; sin, I say, when applied by the law (Psa 51:3).","When the law came to Paul, he remained without sight until the good man came unto him with the word of forgiveness of sins (Acts 9).",4.,"Again; where the law comes with power, there it begetteth many doubts against the grace of God; for it is only a revealer of sin, and the ministration of death; that is, a doctrine that sheweth sin, and condemneth for the same; hence, therefore, as was hinted before, the law being the revealer of sin, where that is embraced, there sin must needs be discovered and condemned, and the soul for the sake of that.","Further, it is not only a revealer of sin, but that which makes it abound; so that the closer any man sticks to the law for life, the faster sin doth cleave to him.","'That law,' saith Paul, 'which was ordained to be unto life, I found to be unto death,' for by the law I became a notorious sinner; I thought to have obtained life by obeying the law, 'but sin taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me' (Rom 7:10-14).","A strange way of deceivableness, and it is hid from the most of men; but, as I have already told you, you see how it comes to pass.",(1.),"Man by nature is carnal, and the law itself is spiritual: now betwixt these two ariseth great difference; the law is exceeding good, the heart exceeding bad; these two opposites, therefore, the heart so abiding, can by no means agree.",(2.),"Therefore, at every approach of the law to the heart with intent to impose duty, or to condemn for the neglect thereof; at every such approach the heart starteth back, especially when the law comes home indeed, and is heard in his own language.","This being thus, the conscience perceiving this is a fault, begins to tremble at the sense of judgment; the law still continueth to command to duty, and to condemn for the neglect thereof.","From this struggling of these two opposites ariseth, I say, those doubts and fears that drive the heart into unbelief, and that make it blind to the word of the gospel, that it can neither see nor understand anything but that it is a sinner, and that the law must be fulfilled by it, if ever it be saved.",[Fifth.],"But again; another thing that hath great influence upon the heart to make it lean to the law for life is, the false names that Satan and his instruments have put upon it; such as these--to call the law the gospel; conscience, the Spirit of Christ; works, faith; and the like: with these, weak consciences have been mightily pestered; yea, thousands deluded and destroyed.","This was the way whereby the enemy attempted to overthrow the church of Christ of old; as, namely, those in Galatia and at Corinth, &c. (2 Cor 11:3,4,13,14).","I say, by the feigned notion that the law was the gospel, the Galatians were removed from the gospel of Christ; and Satan, by appropriating to himself and his ministers the names and titles of the ministers of the Lord Jesus, prevailed with many at Corinth to forsake Paul and his doctrine.","Where the Lord Jesus hath been preached in truth, and something of his doctrine known, it is not there so easy to turn people aside from the sound of the promise of grace, unless it be by the noise and sound of a gospel.","Therefore, I say, the false apostles came thus among the churches: 'another gospel, another gospel'; which, in truth, saith Paul, 'is not another; but some would pervert the gospel of Christ,' and thrust that out of doors, by gilding the law with that glorious name (Gal 1:6-8).","[29] So again, for the ministers of Satan, they must be called the apostles of Christ, and ministers of righteousness; which thing, I say, is of great force, especially being accompanied with so holy and just a doctrine as the word of the law is; for what better to the eye of reason than to love God above all, and our neighbour as ourselves, which doctrine, being the scope of the ten words given on Sinai, no man can contradict; for, in truth, they are holy and good.","But here is the poison; to set this law in the room of a mediator, as those do that seek to stand just before God thereby; and then nothing is so dishonourable to Christ, nor of so soul-destroying a nature as the law; for that, thus placed, hath not only power when souls are deluded, but power to delude, by its real holiness, the understanding, conscience, and reason of a man; and by giving the soul a semblance of heaven, to cause it to throw away Christ, grace, and faith.","Wherefore it behoveth all men to take heed of names, and of appearances of holiness and goodness.",[Sixth.],"Lastly, Satan will yet go further; he will make use of something that may be at a distance from a moral precept, and therewith bring souls under the law.","Thus he did with some of old; he did not make the Galatians fall from Christ by virtue of one of the ten words, but by something that was aloof off; by circumcision, days, and months, that were Levitical ceremonies; for he knows it is no matter, nor in what Testament he found it, if he can therewith hide Christ from the soul--'Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.","For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law' (Gal 5:2,3).","Why so, seeing circumcision is not one of the ten words [commandments]?","Why, because they did it in conscience to God, to stand just before him thereby.","Now here we may behold much cunning of the devil; he begins with some at a distance from that law which curseth, and so by little and little bringeth them under it; even as by circumcision the Galatians were at length brought under the law that condemneth all men to the wrath and judgment of God.","I have often wondered when I have read how God crieth out against the Jews, for observing his own commandment (Isa 1:11-14).","But I perceive by Paul that by these things a man may reject and condemn the Lord Jesus; which those do, that for life set up aught, whether moral or other institution, besides the faith of Jesus.","Let men therefore warily distinguish betwixt names and things, betwixt statute and commandment, lest they by doing the one transgress against the other (2 Cor 1:19,20).","Study, therefore, the nature and end of the law with the nature and end of the gospel; and if thou canst keep them distinct in thy understanding and conscience, neither names nor things, neither statutes nor commandments, can draw thee from the faith of the gospel.","And that thou mayest yet be helped in this matter, I shall now come to speak to the second conclusion.",[THE SECOND POSITION.],SECOND.,"THAT MEN CAN BE JUSTIFIED FROM THE CURSE BEFORE GOD, WHILE SINNERS IN THEMSELVES, BY NO OTHER RIGHTEOUSNESS THAN THAT LONG AGO PERFORMED BY, AND REMAINING WITH, THE PERSON OF CHRIST.","For the better prosecuting of this position I shall observe two things--FIRST, That the righteousness by which we stand just before God, from the curse, was performed by the person of Christ.","SECOND, That this righteousness is inherent only in him.",FIRST.,"As to the first of these, I shall be but brief.","Now, that the righteousness that justifieth us was performed long ago by the person of Christ, besides what hath already been said, is further manifest thus-- First.","He is said to have purged our sins by himself--'When he had by himself purged our sins, he sat down on the right hand of God' (Heb 1:3).","I have showed that in Christ, for the accomplishing of righteousness, there was both doing and suffering; doing, to fulfil all the commands of the law; suffering, to answer its penalty for sin.","This second is that which in this to the Hebrews is in special intended by the apostle, where he saith he hath purged our sins, that is, by his precious blood; for it is that alone can purge our sins, either out of the sight of God or out of the sight of the soul (Heb 9:14).","Now this was done by himself, saith the apostle; that is, in or by his personal doings and sufferings.","And hence it is that when God had rejected the offerings of the law, he said, 'Lo, I come.","A body hast thou prepared me,--to do thy will, O God' (Heb 10:5-8).","Now by this will of God, saith the Scripture, we are sanctified.",By what will?,"Why, by the offering up of the body of Jesus Christ; for that was God's will, that thereby we might be a habitation for him; as he saith again--'Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate' (Heb 13:12).",Second.,"As it is said, he hath purged our sins by himself, so it was by himself at once--'For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified' (10:14).","Now by this word 'at once,' or by 'one offering,' is cut off all those imaginary sufferings of Christ which foolish men conceive of; as that he in all ages hath suffered or suffereth for sin in us.",[30] No; he did this work but once.,"'Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world,' in the time of Pilate, 'hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself' (Heb 9:25,26).","Mark how to the purpose the Holy Ghost expresseth it: he hath suffered but once; and that once, now; now once; now he is God and man in one person; now he hath taken the body that was prepared of God; now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself; by the offering up of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.",Third.,"It further appears, in that by his resurrection from the dead the mercies of God are made sure to the soul, God declaring by that, as was said before, how well pleased he is by the undertaking of his Son for the salvation of the world: 'And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David' (Acts 13:34).","For Christ being clothed with man's flesh, and undertaking for man's sins, did then confirm all sure to us by his resurrection from the dead.","So that by the rising of that man again, mercy and grace are made sure to him that hath believed on Jesus.","Wherefore, from these things, together with what hath been discovered about his addressing himself to the work, I conclude 'that men can be justified from the curse, before God, while sinners in themselves, by no other righteousness than that long ago performed by the person of Christ.'","Now the conclusion is true from all show of contradiction; for the Holy Ghost saith he hath done it; hath done it by himself, and that by the will of God, at once, even then when he took the prepared body upon him--'By the will of God we are sanctified, through the offering up of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.'",[SECOND.],"This being so, the second position is also manifest--namely, that the righteousness by which we stand just from the curse, before God, is only inherent in Jesus Christ.","For if he hath undertaken to bring in a justifying righteousness, and that by works and merits of his own, then that righteousness must of necessity be inherent in him alone, and ours only by imputation; and hence it is called, in that fifth to the Romans, the gift, the 'gift of righteousness'; because neither wrought nor obtained by works of ours, but bestowed upon us, as a garment already prepared, by the mercy of God in Christ (Rom 5:17; Isa 61:10).",There are four things that confirm this for a truth-- First.,"This righteousness is said to be the righteousness of one, not of many; I mean of one properly and personally, as his own particular personal righteousness.","The gift of grace, which is the gift of righteousness, it is 'by one man, Jesus Christ.'","'Much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by ONE, Jesus Christ.","Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of ONE, the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.","For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of ONE shall many be made righteous' (Rom 5:15-19).","Mark, the righteousness of one, the obedience of one; the righteousness of one man, of one man, Jesus.","[31] Wherefore, the righteousness that justifieth a sinner, it is personally and inherently the righteousness of that person only who, by works and acts of obedience, did complete it, even the obedience of one, of one man, Jesus Christ; and so ours only by imputation.","It is improper to say, Adam's eating of the forbidden fruit was personally and inherently an act of mine.","It was personally his, and imputatively mine; personally his, because he did it; imputatively mine, because I was then in him.","Indeed, the effects of his personal eating is found in my person; to wit, defilement and pravity.","The effects also of the imputation of Christ's personal righteousness are truly found in those that are in him by electing love and unfeigned faith, even holy and heavenly dispositions; but a personal act is one thing, and the effects of that another.","The act may be done by, and be only inherent in one; the imputation of the merit of the act, as also the effects of the same, may be in a manner universal, extending itself unto the most, or all.",This the case of Adam and Christ doth manifest.,The sin of one is imputed to his posterity; the righteousness of the other is reckoned the righteousness of those that are his.,Second.,"The righteousness by which we stand just before God from the curse is called, 'The righteousness of the Lord--the righteousness of God--the righteousness of Jesus Christ,' &c. (Phil 3:6-9); and that by way of opposition to the righteousness of God's own holy law--'That I might be found in him, not having on my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.'","Now, by this opposition, as by what was said before, the truth is made exceeding clear; for by these words, 'not having my own righteousness,' are not only excluded what qualifications we suppose to be in us, but the righteousness through which we stand just in the sight of God by them is limited and confined to a person absolutely distinct.","Distinct, I say, as to his person and performances, who here is called God and Jesus Christ; as he saith also in the prophet Isaiah, 'In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory' (Isa 45:25).","In the Lord, not in the law; in the Lord, not in themselves.","'And their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.'","Of me, not of themselves; of me, not of the law (54:17).","And again; 'Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength' (45:24).","Now, as I have already said, all this is to be understood of the righteousness that was fulfilled by acts and works of obedience, which the person of the Son of God accomplished in the days of his flesh in the world; by that man, I say, 'The Lord our righteousness' (Jer 23:5).","Christ, indeed, is naturally and essentially righteousness; but as he is simply such, so he justifieth no man; for then he need not to bear our sins in his flesh, and become obedient in all points of the law for us; but the righteousness by which we stand just before God is righteousness consisting of works and deeds, of the doings and sufferings, of such a person who also is essentially righteousness.","And hence, as before I have hinted, we are said to be justified by the obedience and blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, by the doings and sufferings of the Son of God.","And hence, again, it is that he first is called King of righteousness; that is, a King of righteousness as God-man, which of necessity supposeth his personal performances; and after that, 'King of peace' (Heb 7:1-3).","For what he is naturally and eternally in his Godhead, he is not to us, but himself; but what he is actively and by works, he is not to himself, but to us; so, then, he is neither King of righteousness nor of peace to us, as he is only the eternal Son of the Father, without his being considered as our priest and undertaker.","He hath 'obtained,' by works of righteousness, 'eternal redemption for us' (Heb 9:12).","So then, the righteousness by which we stand just before God is a righteousness inherent only in Christ, because a righteousness performed by him alone.","Now, that righteousness by which we stand just before God must be a righteousness consisting of personal performances; the reason is, because persons had sinned; this the nature of justice requireth, that 'since by man came death, by man' should come 'also the resurrection from the dead' (1 Cor 15:21).","The angels, therefore, for this very reason, abide under the chains of everlasting darkness, because he 'took not hold on them' (Heb 2:16,17); that is, by fulfilling righteousness for them in their nature.","That is a blessed word, to you.","'To you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.'","To YOU, not to angels; to you is born a Saviour (Luke 2:11).",Third.,"It is yet further evident that the righteousness by which we stand just before God from the curse, is a righteousness inherent, not in us, but Christ; because it is a righteousness besides, and without the law itself.","Now take away the law, and you take away the rule of righteousness.","Again; take away the rule, and the act as to us must cease.","'But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets' (Rom 3:21).","So then, by such a righteousness we are justified as is not within the power of the law to command of us.",Quest.,But what law is that which hath not power to command our obedience in the point of our justification with God?,Answ.,"The moral law, or that called the ten commandments.","Therefore we are neither commanded to love God, or our neighbour, as the means or part of our justifying righteousness; nay, he that shall attempt to do these things to be delivered from the curse thereby, by the scripture is holden accursed of God.","'As many as are of the works,' or duties, 'of the law, are under the curse,' &c. (Gal 3:10).","Because we are justified not by that of the law, but by the righteousness of God without the law; that is, without its commanding of us, without our obedience to it--'Freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood' (Rom 3:24,25).","This is the righteousness of God without the law; that is, without any of our obedience to the law.","Wherefore the righteousness by which we stand just, in the sight of God, cannot be inherent in us, but in Christ the King thereof.",Fourth.,"This is further made apparent, by the capacity that God will consider that soul in, to whom he imputeth justifying righteousness; and that is, 'as one that worketh not,' as one that stands ungodly in the judgment of the law (Rom 4:4,5).","But this I have handled before, and therefore shall pass it here.",Fifth.,To conclude.,"If any works of ours could justify us before God, they would be works after faith received; but it is evident that these do not; therefore the righteousness that justifies us from the curse before God is a righteousness inherent only in Christ.","That works after faith do not justify us from the curse, in the sight of God, is evident-- 1.","Because no works of the saints can be justified by the moral law, considering it as the law of works for life (Gal 3:10).","For this must stand a truth for ever--Whatsoever justifieth us must be justified by the moral law, for that is it that pronounceth the curse; unless, then, that curse be taken away by the work, the work cannot justify us before God (Rom 3:21).","But the curse cannot be taken away but by a righteousness that is first approved of by that law that so curseth; for if that shall yet complain for want of a full satisfaction, the penalty remaineth.","This is evident to reason, and confirmed by the authority of God's Word, as hath been already proved; because the law, once broken, pronounceth death, expecteth death, and executeth the same on him that will stand to the judgment of the law; but no work of a believer is capable of answering this demand of the law; therefore none of his works can justify him before God; for the law, that notwithstanding, complaineth.",2.,"No works of faith can justify us from the curse before God, because of the want of perfection that is in the greatest faith in us.","Now, if faith be not perfect, the work cannot be perfect; I mean with that perfection as to please Divine justice.","Consider the person, one that hath to do with God immediately by himself.","Now, that faith is not capable of this kind of perfection, it is evident, because when men here know most, they know but in part.","Now he that knows but in part, can do but in part; and he that doth but in part, hath a part wanting in the judgment of the justice of God.","So then, when thou hast done all thou canst, thou hast done but part of thy duty, and so art short of justification from the curse by what thou hast done (1 Cor 8:2, 13:12).",3.,"Besides, it looks too like a monster that the works of faith should justify us before God; because then faith is turned, as it were, with its neck behind it.","[32] Faith, in its own nature and natural course, respecteth the mercy of God through the Mediator, Jesus Christ; and as such, its virtue and excellency is to expect justification by grace through him; but by this doctrine faith is turned round about, and now makes a life out of what itself hath done; but, methinks, faith should be as noble as its fruits, that being the first, and they but the fruits of that.","Besides, seeing the work is only good because it floweth from faith (for faith purifieth the heart), therefore faith is it that justifies all its works (Acts 15:9).","If, then, we be justified by either, it is by faith, and not by his works; unless we will say there is more virtue in the less than in the greater.","Now, what is faith but a believing, a trusting, or relying act of the soul?","What, then, must it rely upon or trust in?","Not in itself; that is, without Scripture; not in its works, they are inferior to itself; besides, this is the way to make even the works of faith the mediator between God and the soul, and so by them thrust Christ out of doors; therefore it must trust in Christ; and if so, then no man can be justified from the curse, before God, by the works that flow from faith.",4.,"To put all out of doubt; the saint, when he hath done what he can to bring forth good works by faith, yet he dares not show these works before God but as they pass through the Mediator Christ, but as they are washed in the blood of the Lamb.","And therefore Peter saith, those sacrifices of ours that are truly spiritual are only then accepted of God, when offered up by Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:5).","And therefore it is said again, that the prayers of the saints, which are the fruits of faith, come up before the throne of God through the angel's hand; that is, through the hand of Christ, through his golden censer, perfumed with his incense, made acceptable by his intercession (Rev 8:3,4).","It is said in the Book of Revelation, that it is granted to the bride, the Lamb's wife, that she should be 'arrayed in fine linen, clean and white; which white linen is the righteousness of saints.'","This fine linen, in my judgment, is the works of godly men, their works that sprang from faith.",But how came they clean?,How came they white?,Not simply because they were the works of faith.,"But mark, they 'washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.'","And 'therefore they stand before the throne of God' (Rev 7:14,15).","Yea, therefore it is that their good works stand there too.","I conclude, then, 'our persons are justified while we are sinners in ourselves.'","Our works, even the works of faith, are no otherwise accepted but as they come through Jesus Christ, even through his intercession and blood.","So then, Christ doth justify both our person and works, not by way of approbation, as we stand in ourselves or works before God, but by presenting of us to his Father by himself, washing what we are and have from guilt in his blood, and clothing us with his own performances.","This is the cause of our acceptance with God, and that our works are not cast forth of his presence.",THE USE.,USE FIRST.--Is justifying righteousness to be found in the person of Christ only?,"Then this should admonish us to take heed of seeking it in ourselves; that is, of working righteousness, thereby to appease the justice of God, lest by so doing we affront and blaspheme the righteousness of Christ.","He that shall go about to establish his own righteousness, he, as yet, doth defiance to that which is of God, of God's appointing, of God's providing; and that only wherewith the justice of the law must be well pleased.","Wherefore take heed, I say, of doing such a thing, lest it provoke the eyes of the Lord's glory--'When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it' (Eze 33:13).","Mark, though he be righteous, yea, though he have a promise of life, yet he shall die.",But why?,"Because he sinned against the Lord by trusting to his own righteousness, therefore he must die for it.",There are some things that will preserve a man from splitting upon this rock.,"As, First.","Get good acquaintance with the covenant of grace, and of the persons concerned in the conditions of that covenant.","The conditions of that covenant are, that a righteousness shall be brought into the world that shall please the justice of God, and answer and so remove the curse of the law.","Now he that doth perform this condition is Christ; therefore the covenant is not immediately with man, but with him that will be the Mediator betwixt God and man: 'As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant, I have sent forth thy prisoners,' speaking of Christ (Zech 9:11).","So then, Christ, the Man Christ, is he who was to bring in these conditions; to wit, everlasting righteousness.","And hence it is that God hath said, Christ shall be the covenant of the people--that is, he shall be our conditions to Godward (Dan 9:23,24).","He, therefore, is all our righteousness as to the point of our justification before God; he is the covenant of the people, as well as the light of the Gentiles; for as no man can see but in the light of his Spirit, so no man can stand but in and by him; he is the covenant of the people, the conditions and qualifications of the people (Isa 52:6).","So that to Godward Christ is all in all, and no man anything at all.","He hath made with me an everlasting covenant; with me, as I stand in my head, Christ, who, because he hath brought in everlasting righteousness, therefore hath removed the curse of the law; wherefore he adds, this covenant 'is ordered in all things, and sure,' because all points that concern me, as to redemption from the curse, are taken away by Christ, as before is discoursed (2 Sam 23:5).","Look, then, upon Christ as the man, the mediator, undertaker, and accomplisher of that righteousness in himself, wherein thou must stand just before God; and that he is the covenant or conditions of the people to Godward, always having in himself the righteousness that the law is well pleased with, and always presenting himself before God as our only righteousness.",Second.,"That this truth may be the more heartily inquired into by thee, consider thine own perfections;[33] I say, study how polluted thou art, even from the heart throughout.",No man hath a high esteem of the Lord Jesus that is a stranger to his own sore.,"Christ's church is an hospital of sick, wounded, and afflicted people; even as when he was in the world, the afflicted and distressed set the highest price upon Jesus Christ.",Why?,"They were sick, and he was the Physician; but the whole had no need of him.","And just thus it is now: Christ is offered to the world to be the righteousness and life of sinners, but no man will regard him save he that seeth his own pollution; he that seeth he cannot answer the demands of the law, he that sees himself from top to toe polluted, and that therefore his service cannot be clean as to justify him from the curse before God--he is the man that must needs die in despair and be damned, or must trust in Jesus Christ for life.","Further, This rule I would have all receive that come to Jesus Christ for life and salvation-- 1.","Not to stick at the acknowledgment of sin, but to make that of it which the law makes of it: 'Acknowledge thine iniquity,' saith the Lord (Jer 3:13).","This is a hard pinch, I know what I say, for a man to fall down under the sense of sins by acknowledging them to be what the Lord saith they are; to acknowledge them, I say, in their own defiling and polluting nature; to acknowledge them in their unreasonable and aggravating circumstances; to acknowledge them in their God-offending and soul-destroying nature, especially when the conscience is burdened with the guilt of them.","Yet this is duty: 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive' (1 John 1:9).","Yea, to this is annexed the promise, 'He that confesseth and forsaketh them shall find mercy.'","This made David, as it were, lay claim to the mercy of God--'Wash me thoroughly,' said he, 'from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin; for I acknowledge my transgression, and my sin is ever before me.'","Though, then, thou art to blush and be ashamed when thou rememberest thy sins and iniquities, yet do not hide them--'He that covereth his sins shall not prosper.'","Do not lessen them; do not speak of them before God after a mincing way--'Acknowledge thine iniquities, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree; and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the Lord' (Jer 3:13).",2.,"If we would come to Christ aright, we must only acknowledge our sins; we must ONLY acknowledge them, and there stop; stop, I say, from attempting to do aught to present us good before God, but only to receive the mercy offered.",'Only acknowledge thine iniquities.',"Men are subject to two extremes, either to confess sins notionally and by the halves; or else, together with the confession of them, to labour to do some holy work, thereby to ease their burdened consciences, and beget faith in the mercy of God (Hosea 5:15).","Now both these are dangerous, and very ungodly--dangerous, because the wound is healed falsely; and ungodly, because the command is transgressed: 'Only acknowledge thy sin,' and there stand, as David, 'till thy guilt is taken away.'","Joshua stood before the angel, from top to toe in filthy garments, till the Lord put other clothes upon him (Zech 3:3-5).","In the matter of thy justification thou must know nothing, see nothing, hear nothing, but thine own sins and Christ's righteousness--'Only acknowledge thine iniquities.'","Now the Saviour and the soul comes rightly together; the Saviour to do his work, which is to spread his skirt over the sinner; and the sinner to receive, by believing this blessed imputed righteousness.","And hence the church, when she came to God, lieth down in her shame, and her confusion covereth her; and so lieth till pardon comes (Jer 3:25).",USE SECOND.--I come now to the second use--Have faith in Christ.,But what are we to understand by faith?,Answ.,"Faith importeth as much as to say, Receive, embrace, accept of, or trust in, the benefit offered.","All which are, by holy men of God, words used on purpose to show that the mercy of God, the forgiveness of sins, and eternal life, are not to be had by doing, or by the law; but by receiving, embracing, accepting, or trusting to the mercy of God through Christ: 'We believe that through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they' (Acts 15:11; John 1:12; 2 Cor 4:1, 11:4; Col 2:6; Heb 11:13; 1 Tim 1:15; Eph 1:12-13).","Thus you see what the gospel is, and what faith doth do in the salvation of the soul.","Now, that faith might be helped in this work, for great are they that oppose it, therefore the Scriptures, the Word of truth, hath presented us with the invitation in most plain and suitable sentences: as, 'That Christ came into the world to save sinners--Christ died for our sins--Christ gave himself for our sins--Christ bare our sins in his body on the tree--and that God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you.'","Further, as the invitations are plain and easy, so the threatenings to the opposers are sore and astonishing: 'He that believeth not shall be damned--Because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved, God gave them up to strong delusions, that they all might be damned' (Mark 16:16; 2 Thess 2:10-12).",Object.,But faith is said to be an act of obedience.,Answ.,"And well it may, for it is the most submitting act that a man can do; it throweth out all our righteousness; it makes the soul poor in itself; it liveth upon God and Christ, as the almsman doth upon his lord; it consenteth to the gospel that it is true; it giveth God and Christ the glory of their mercy and merit; it loveth God for his mercy, and Jesus Christ for his service; whatever good it doth, it still crieth, Hereby am I not justified, but he that justifieth me is the Lord.","Well, but is there in truth such a thing as the obedience of faith?","Then let Christians labour to understand it, and distinguish it aright, and to separate it from the law and all man's righteousness; and remember that it is a receiving of mercy, an embracing of forgiveness, an accepting of the righteousness of Christ, and a trusting to these for life.","Remember, again, that it putteth the soul upon coming to Christ as a sinner, and to receive forgiveness as a sinner, as such.",We now treat of justification.,"But a little to insert at large a few more of the excellencies of it, and so draw towards a conclusion.","The more thou believest for remission of sins, the more of the light of the glorious gospel of Christ thou receivest into thy soul--'For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith' (Rom 1:17).","That is, according to the degree of faith.","Little faith seeth but little but great faith seeth much; and therefore he saith again, that by faith we have 'access into the grace of God' (Rom 5:2).","The reason is, 1.","Because faith, having laid hold upon Christ, hath found him 'in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge' (Col 2:3).","In him therefore it finds and sees those heights and depths of gospel mysteries that are nowhere else to be found; nay, let a man be destitute of faith, and it is not possible he should once think of some of them.",2.,By this means the Holy Spirit is plentifully received (Gal 3:1-3).,"Now the Spirit of God is a spirit of wisdom and revelation; but yet so as in the knowledge of Christ; otherwise the Spirit will show to man not any mighty thing, its great delight being to open Christ and to reveal him unto faith (Eph 1:17).","Faith indeed can see him, for that is the eye of the soul; and the Spirit alone can reveal him, that being the searcher of the deep things of God; by these therefore the mysteries of heaven are revealed and received.","And hence it is that the mystery of the gospel is called the 'mystery of faith,' or the mystery with which faith only hath to do (1 Tim 3:9).","Wouldst thou, then, know the greatest things of God?","Accustom thyself to the obedience of faith,[34] live upon thy justifying righteousness, and never think that to live always on Christ for justification is a low and beggarly thing, and as it were a staying at the foundation; for let me tell you, depart from a sense of the meritorious means of your justification with God, and you will quickly grow light, and frothy, and vain.","Besides, you will always be subject to errors and delusions; for this is not to hold the head from or through which nourishment is administered (Col 2:19).","Further, no man that buildeth forsakes the good foundation; that is the ground of his encouragement to work, for upon that is laid the stress of all; and without it nothing that is framed can be supported, but must inevitably fall to the ground.",Again; why not live upon Christ alway?,"and especially as he standeth the mediator between God, and the soul, defending thee with the merit of his blood, and covering thee with his infinite righteousness from the wrath of God and curse of the law.",Can there be any greater comfort ministered to thee than to know thy person stands just before God?,Just and justified from all things that would otherwise swallow thee up?,"Is peace with God and assurance of heaven of so little respect with thee that thou slightest the very foundation thereof, even faith in the blood and righteousness of Christ?",and are notions and whimsies of such credit with thee that thou must leave the foundation to follow them?,"But again; what mystery is desirable to be known that is not to be found in Jesus Christ, as Priest, Prophet, or King of saints?","In him are hid all the treasures of them, and he alone hath the key of David to open them (Col 2:1,2; Rev 3:7).","Paul was so taken with Jesus Christ, and the knowledge of this, that he was crucified for us, that he desired, nay, determined not to know any thing else among the Corinthians, that itched after other wisdom (1 Cor 2:2).",Object.,"But I see not that in Christ now, that I have seen in him in former days.","Besides, I find the Spirit lead me forth to study other things.",Answ.,"To the first part of this objection I would answer several things.--The cause why thou seest not that in Christ now, which thou hast seen in him in former days, is not in Christ, but in thy faith; he is the same, as fresh, and as good, and as full of blessedness, as when thou didst most rejoice in him (Heb 1:11,12).","And why not now, as well as formerly?","God is never weary of being delighted with Jesus Christ; his blood is always precious with God; his merits being those in which justice hath everlasting rest, why shouldst thou wander or go about to change thy way?",(Prov 8:30; Jer 2:36).,"Sin is the same as ever, and so is the curse of the law.",The devil is as busy as ever; and beware of the law in thy members.,"Return, therefore, to thy rest, O soul!","for he is thy life, and the length of thy days.","Guilt is to be taken off now, as it was years ago; and whether thou seest it or no, thou sinnest in all thy works.","How, then, canst thou stand clear from guilt in thy soul who neglectest to act faith in the blood of the Lamb?","There thou must wash thy robes, and there thou must make them white (Rev 7:14,15).","I conclude, then, thou art a polluted, surfeited, corrupted, hardened creature, whosoever thou art, that thus objectest.","But I find, sayest thou, as if the Spirit led me forth to study other matters.",Answ.--First.,What other matters?,"What matters besides, above, or beyond the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ, and of our acceptance with God through him?","What spirit, or doctrine, or wisdom soever it be that centres not in, that cometh not from, and that terminates not within, the bonds of the gospel of Jesus Christ, is not worthy the study of the sons of God; neither is it food for the faith of Jesus Christ, for that is the flesh of Christ, and that is eternal life (John 6:5).",Whither will you go?,Beware of the spirit of Antichrist; for 'many false spirits are gone out into the world.',"I told you before, that the Spirit of God is 'the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Christ,' and that without and besides the Lord Jesus it discovereth nothing (Eph 1:17).","It is sent to testify of him; it is sent to bring his words to our remembrance; it is sent to take of his things and show them unto us (John 14,15,16).","Wherefore, never call that the Spirit of Jesus which leads you away from the blood and righteousness of Christ; that is but the spirit of delusion and of the devil, whose teachings end in perdition and destruction.",Tempt not Christ as they of old did.,But how did they tempt him?,"Why, in loathing the manna, which was the type of his flesh and blood, which we are to eat of by believing.","I say, tempt him not, lest you be destroyed by the serpents, by the gnawing guilt of sin; for, take away Christ, and sin remains, and there is no more sacrifice for sin: if so, thou wilt be destroyed by the destroyer (Num 21:5-7; 1 Cor 10:10).",But again-- Second.,"Living by faith begets in the heart a son-like boldness and confidence to God-ward in all our gospel duties, under all our weaknesses, and under all our temptations.","It is a blessed thing to be privileged with a holy boldness and confidence God-ward, that he is on our side, that he taketh part with us and that he will plead our cause 'with them that rise up against us' (2 Cor 2:14, 4:17,18; Gal 2:20).","But this boldness faith helpeth us to do, and also manageth in our heart.",This is that which made Paul always triumph and rejoice in God and the Lord Jesus (Phil 3:3; Rom 5:11).,"He lived the life of faith; for faith sets a man in the favour of God by Christ, and makes a man see that what befals him in this life, it shall, through the wisdom and mercy of God, not only prove for his forwarding to heaven, but to augment his glory when he comes there.","This man now stands on high, he lives, he is rid of slavish fears and carking cares, and in all his straits he hath a God to go to!","Thus David, when all things looked awry upon him, 'encouraged himself in the Lord his God' (1 Sam 30:6).","Daniel also believed in his God, and knew that all his trouble, losses, and crosses, would be abundantly made up in his God (Dan 6:23).","And David said, 'I had fainted unless I had believed' (Psa 27:13).","Believing, therefore, is a great preservative against all such impediments, and makes us confident in our God, and with boldness to come into his presence, claiming privilege in what he is and hath (Jonah 3:4,5).","For by faith, I say, he seeth his acceptance through the Beloved, and himself interested in the mercy of God, and riches of Christ, and glory in the world to come (Heb 10:22,23; Eph 1:4-7).","This man can look upon all the dangers in hell and earth without paleness of countenance; he shall meditate terror with comfort, 'because he beholds the King in his beauty' (Isa 33:17,18).",Again-- Third.,"Living by faith makes a man exercise patience and quietness under all his afflictions; for faith shows him that his best part is safe, that his soul is in God's special care and protection, purged from sin in the blood of Christ.","Faith also shows him that after a little while he shall be in the full enjoyment of that which now he believes is coming: 'We, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith' (Gal 5:5).","Wherefore, upon this ground it is that James exhorteth the saints to whom he wrote, to patience, because they knew the harvest would in due time come (James 5:7-11).","Faith lodgeth the soul with Christ: 'I know,' saith Paul, 'on whom I have believed,' and to whom I have committed my soul, 'and am persuaded,' I believe it, 'that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day'; therefore it were no shame to him to wear a chain for his name and sake (2 Tim 1:12).",O!,"it is a blessed thing to see, I say, by the faith of the Lord Jesus, that we are embarked in the same ship with him; this will help us greatly 'both to hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord' (Psa 46:1-6; Lam 3:26).",Further-- Fourth.,"I might add, that living by faith is the way to receive fresh strength from heaven, thereby to manage thine every day's work with life and vigour; yea, every look by faith upon Jesus Christ, as thine, doth this great work.","It is said, when Paul saw the brethren that came to meet him, 'he thanked God, and took courage' (Acts 28:15).",O!,"how much more, then, shall the Christian be blessed with fresh strength and courage even at the beholding of Christ; whom 'beholding as in a glass,' we 'are changed,' even by beholding of him by faith in the word, 'into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord' (2 Cor 3:18).",But to be brief.,Fifth.,"Make conscience of the duty of believing, and be as afraid of falling short here as in any other command of God.","'This is his commandment, that you believe' (1 John 3:23).","Believe, therefore, in the name of the Lord Jesus.","This is the will of God, that you believe.","Believe, therefore, to the saving of the soul (John 6:46).","Unbelief is a fine-spun thread, not so easily discerned as grosser sins; and therefore that is truly 'The sin that doth so easily beset us' (Heb 12:1).","The light of nature will show those sins that are against the law of nature; but the law of faith is a command beyond what flesh or nature teacheth; therefore to live by faith is so much the harder work; yet it must be done, otherwise thine other duties profit thee nothing.","For if a man give way to unbelief, though he be most frequent in all other duties besides, so often as he worshippeth God in these, he yet saith, God is a liar in the other, even because he hath not believed: 'He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.","And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son' (1 John 5:10,11).","So then, when thou givest way to unbelief; when thou dost not venture the salvation of thy soul upon the justifying life that is in Christ--that is, in his blood, &c.,--at once, thou givest the lie to the whole testament of God; yea, thou tramplest upon the promise of grace, and countest this precious blood an unholy and unworthy thing (Heb 10:29).","Now how, thou doing thus, the Lord should accept of thy other duties, of prayer, alms, thanksgiving, self-denial, or any other, will be hard for thee to prove.","In the meantime remember, that faith pleaseth God; and that without faith it is impossible to please him.","Remember also, that for this cause it was that the offering of Cain was not accepted: 'By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain'; for by faith Abel first justified the promise of the Messias, by whom a conquest should be obtained over the devil, and all the combination of hell against us: then he honoured Christ by believing that he was able to save him; and in token that he believed these things indeed, he presented the Lord with the firstlings of his flock, as a remembrance before God that he believed in his Christ (Heb 11:4).","And therefore it is said, 'By faith he offered'; by which means the offering was accepted of God; for no man's offering can be accepted with God but his that stands righteous before him first.","But unbelief holdeth men under their guilt, because they have not believed in Christ, and by that means put on his righteousness.","Again; he that believeth not, hath made invalid--what in him lies--the promise of God and merits of Christ, of whom the Father hath spoken so worthily; therefore what duties or acts of obedience soever he performeth, God by no means can be pleased with him.","By this, therefore, you see the miserable state of the people that have not faith--'Whatever they do, they sin'; if they break the law, they sin; if they endeavour to keep it, they sin.","They sin, I say, upon a double account: first, because they do it but imperfectly; and, secondly, because they yet stay upon that, resisting that which is perfect, even that which God hath appointed.","It mattereth not, as to justification from the curse, therefore; men wanting faith, whether they be civil or profane, they are such as stand accursed of the law, because they have not believed, and because they have given the lie to the truth, and to the God of truth.","Let all men, therefore, that would please God make conscience of believing; on pain, I say, of displeasing him; on pain of being, with Cain, rejected, and on pain of being damned in hell.",'He that believeth not shall be damned' (Mark 16:16).,"Faith is the very quintessence of all gospel obedience, it being that which must go before other duties, and that which also must accompany whatever I do in the worship of God, if it be accepted of him.",[35] Here you may see a reason why the force and power of hell is so bent against believing.,"Satan hateth all the parts of our Christian obedience, but the best and chiefest most.","And hence the apostle saith to the Thessalonians, that he sent to know their faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted them, and so his labour had been in vain (1 Thess 3:5).","Indeed, where faith is wanting, or hath been destroyed, all the labour is in vain, nothing can profit any man, neither as to peace with God, nor the acceptance of any religious duty; and this, I say, Satan knows, which makes him so bend his force against us.",There are three things in the act of believing which make this grace displeasing to the wicked one-- 1.,"Faith discovereth the truth of things to the soul; the truth of things as they are, whether they be things that are of this world, or of that which is to come; the things and pleasures above, and also those beneath.","Faith discovereth to the soul the blessedness, and goodness, and durableness of the one; the vanity, foolishness, and transitoriness of the other.","Faith giveth credit to all things that are written in the law and in the prophets (Acts 24:14), both as to the being, nature, and attributes of God; the blessed undertaking of the Lord Jesus Christ; the glory of heaven and torments of hell; the sweetness of the promise and terror of the threatenings and curses of the Word; by which means Satan is greatly frustrated in his assaults when he tempteth either to love this world or slight that which is to come, for he can do no great matter in these things to any but those who want the faith.","'In vain is the snare laid in the sight of any bird' (Prov 1:17); therefore he must first blind, and hold blind, the minds of men, 'that the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine unto them,' else he can do no harm to the soul (2 Cor 4:4).","Now, faith is the eye of the godly man, and that sees the truth of things, whatever Satan suggests, either about the glory of this world, the sweetness of sin, the uncertainty of another world, or the like (1 John 5:4,5; Heb.",11:27).,2.,"Faith wraps the soul up in the bundle of life with God; it encloseth it in the righteousness of Jesus, and presents it so perfect in that, that whatever he can do, with all his cunning, cannot render the soul spotted or wrinkled before the justice of the law; yea, though the man, as to his own person and acts, be full of sin from top to toe, Jesus Christ covereth all; faith sees it, and holds the soul in the godly sense and comfort of it.","The man, therefore, standing here, stands shrouded under that goodly robe that makes him glisten in the eye of justice.","Yea, all the answer that Satan can get from God against such a soul is, that he 'doth not see iniquity in Jacob, nor behold perverseness in Israel'; for here 'Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the Lord of hosts, though,' as to their own persons, 'their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel' (Num 23:21-23; Jer 51:5; Rom 6:14; Deut 33:12).","Thus, therefore, the soul believing, is hid from all the power of the enemy, and dwells safely under the dominion of grace.",3.,"Faith keeps the soul from giving credit to any of his insinuations; for whatever Satan saith, either about the acceptance of my person or performances, so long as I believe that both are accepted of God for Christ's sake, he suggesteth to the wind; wherefore faith doth the same against the devil that unbelief doth to God.",Doth unbelief count God a liar?,Faith counts the devil a liar.,Doth unbelief hold the soul from the mercy of God?,Faith holds the soul from the malice of the devil.,Doth unbelief quench thy graces?,Faith kindleth them even into a flame.,Doth unbelief fill the soul full of sorrow?,Faith fills it full of the joy of the Holy Ghost.,"In a word, doth unbelief bind down thy sins upon thee?","Why, faith in Jesus Christ releaseth thee of them all.",4.,"As faith keeps the soul from giving credit to the insinuations of Satan, so, when he makes his assaults, it over-masters him, and makes him retreat; 'Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.--Whom resist steadfast in the faith' (James 4:7; 1 Peter 5:9).","Believe, as I have already said, that God loveth you, that the blood of Christ was shed for you, that your person is presented complete before him, through the righteousness of Christ, and Satan must give place; thy crediting of the gospel makes him fly before thee; but thou must do it steadfast in the faith; every waverer giveth him advantage.","And, indeed, this is the reason that the godly are so foiled with his assaults, they do not resist him steadfast in the faith; they often stagger through unbelief.","Now, at every stagger he recovereth lost ground again, and giveth battle another time.","Besides, by this and the other stagger he taketh heart to attempt by other means, and so doubleth the affliction with manifold temptations.","This is, I say, for want of being steadfast.","'Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked' (Eph 6:16).","To quench them, though they come from him as kindled with the very fire of hell.","None knows, save him that feels it, how burning hot the fiery darts of Satan are; and how, when darted, they kindle upon our flesh and unbelief; neither can any know the power and worth of faith to quench them but he that hath it, and hath power to act it.",5.,"Lastly, if justifying righteousness be alone to be found in the person of Jesus Christ, then this shows us the sad condition of two sorts of men--1.",Of those that hang in doubt betwixt Christ and the law.,2.,Of those that do professedly make denial of the sufficiency of this most blessed righteousness.,First.,"The first sort, though they may seek life, yet, thus continuing, are never like to find it.",Wherefore?,"Because they seek it not by faith, but, as it were, by the works of the law.","Indeed, they will not be merit-mongers; they will not wholly trust to the law; they will partly venture on Christ, and partly trust to the law.","Well, but therefore they shall be damned, because they trust to Christ but in part, and in part, as it were, to the works of the law; for such sinners make Christ but a Saviour in part--why, then, should he be their Saviour in whole?","No; because they halt between Christ and the law, therefore they shall fall between Christ and the law; yea, because they will trust to their works in part, they shall be but almost saved by Christ.",Let not that man think that he shall obtain any thing from the Lord.,What man?,"Why, he that doubteth or wavereth in his mind about the truth of the mercy of God in Christ.","Therefore the exhortation is, 'But let him ask in faith.--For he that wavereth,' or, that halteth between the law and Christ for life, 'is like a wave of the sea, driven of the wind and tossed' (James 1:6).","In conclusion, he resteth nowhere--'a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways' (v 8).","This man, therefore, must miscarry; he must not see the good land that flows with milk and honey; no, let him not have a thought of life in his heart; let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.","[36] This was the case of many in the primitive times, for whose sake this caution was written; for the devout and religious Jew and proselyte, when they fell away from the word of the gospel, they did not fall to those gross and abominable pollutions in which the open profane, like sows and swine, do wallow, but they fell from the grace of God to the law; or, at least, did rest betwixt them both, doubting of the sufficiency of either; and thus, being fearful, they distrust; wherefore, being found at length unbelieving, they are reputed of God abominable, as murderers, whoremongers, sorcerers, idolators, and liars, and so must have their portion in the lake, with them, that burns with fire and brimstone (Rev 21:8).","The reason is, because where Christ is rejected sin remaineth, and so the wrath of God for sin.","Neither will he be a Saviour in part; he must be all thy salvation, or none.",'Let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord' (James 1:7; John 3:36).,Not any thing.,"There is no promise for him, no pardon for him, no heaven for him, no salvation for him, no escaping of his fire!",What condition is this man in?,"Yet he is a religious man, for he prays; he is a seeking man, a desiring man, for he prays; but he halts between two, he leaneth to his righteousness, and committeth iniquity.",He is afraid to venture all upon the Lord Jesus Christ.,Let not that man think of receiving any thing from the Lord!,"Yet the words suggest that he is apt to think he shall receive something, because God is merciful, because his promise is great; but this expectation is by this word cut off, and this sinner is cast away.","Let not that man think, let him forbear to think, of having anything at the hand of God.",The Israelites thought to go up to the land the day after they had despised it.,Agag thought the bitterness of death was past even that day in which he was hewn to pieces.,Rechab and Baanah his brother thought to have received reward of David that day they were hanged over the pool in Hebron.,"Let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord' (Num 14:40-45; 1 Sam 15:32,33; 2 Sam 4:12).",Second.,"As for those that do professedly make denial of the sufficiency of this most blessed righteousness, the whole book is conviction to them, and shall assuredly, if it comes to their hands, rise up in judgment against them.","They have rejected the wisdom and mercy of God; they have rejected the means of their salvation; they have trampled upon the blood of the Son of God; wherefore judgment waiteth for them, and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.",[A word to neglecters of Christ.],To conclude.,One word also to you that are neglecters of Jesus Christ: 'How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?',"Here then, we may see how we ought to judge of all such persons as neglect the Lord Jesus, under what guise, name, or notion soever they be.","We ought, I say, to judge of such, that they are at present in a state of condemnation; of condemnation, 'because they have not believed in the only-begotten Son of God' (John 3:18).","It is true, there is no man more at ease in his mind, with such ease as it is, than the man that hath not closed with the Lord Jesus, but is shut up in unbelief.",O!,"but that is the man that stands convict before God, and that is bound over to the great assize; that is the man whose sins are still his own, and upon whom the wrath of God abideth (v 36); for the ease and peace of such, though it keep them far from fear, is but like to that of the secure thief, that is ignorant that the constable standeth at the door; the first sight of an officer makes his peace to give up the ghost (1 John 5:12).","Ah, how many thousands that can now glory that they never were troubled for sin against God; I say, how many be there that God will trouble worse than he troubled cursed Achan, because their peace, though false, and of the devil, was rather chosen by them than peace by Jesus Christ, than 'peace with God by the blood of his cross' (Col 1:20).","Awake, careless sinners, awake!","and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.","Content not yourselves either with sin or righteousness, if you be destitute of Jesus Christ, but cry, cry, O cry to God for light to see your condition by; for light in the Word of God, for therein is the righteousness of God revealed (Eph 5:14).","Cry, therefore, for light to see this righteousness by; it is a righteousness of Christ's finishing, of God's accepting, and that which alone can save the soul from the stroke of eternal justice!",(Rom 1:17).,"There are six things that on man's part are the cause he receiveth not the gospel of Christ, and so life by him--1.","They see not their state by nature, how polluted they are with original sin (Eph 2:2).",2.,"They see not the justice of God against sin; they know not him that hath said, 'Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense' (Heb 10:30).",3.,They cannot see the beauty of Jesus Christ (2 Cor 4:4).,4.,"Unbelief being mighty in them, they dare not venture their souls with Jesus Christ.","They dare not trust to his righteousness, and to that only (Rev 21:8).","For, 5.","Their carnal reason also sets itself against the word of faith, and cannot stoop to the grace of Jesus Christ (1 Cor 2:14).",6.,"They love to have honour one of another, they love to be commended for their own vain-glorious righteousness; and the fools think that because they are commended of men, they shall be commended of God also: 'How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?'",(John 5:44).,"This last thing--to wit, desire of vain-glory, is the bane of thousands; it is the legalist's bane, it is the civilian's[37] bane, it is the formalist's bane, yea, which yet is stranger, it is the bane of the vicious and debauched also;[38] for though there be a generation that, to one's thinking, have not regard to righteousness, yet watch them narrowly, and they have their times of doing something that looks like good, and though possibly it be but seldom, yet this wretch counteth that, for the sake of that, God accepteth him, and counteth his, glorious righteousness.","I might add a seventh cause, which is, want of serious meditation upon eternal judgment, and what shall follow.","This consideration, did it take a deep place in the heart, would doubtless produce these workings of spirit after Jesus Christ for justification that now are wanting in the most of men.","This made Felix, yea, it makes the devils, tremble; and would, I say, couldst thou deeply meditate, make thee start and turn thy wanton thoughts into heavy sighs after God's mercy in Jesus Christ, lest thou also come into their place of torment.","Before I conclude this use, I would lay down a few motives, if so be thou mayest be prevailed with to look after thine own everlasting state.",1.,"Consider, God hath put man above all the creatures in this visible world, into a state of abiding for ever; they cannot be annihilated, they shall never again be turned into nothing, but must live with God or the devil for ever and ever.","And though the scripture saith, 'Man hath not pre-eminence over a beast in his death,' yet the beast hath pre-eminence above many men, for he shall not rise again to come into judgment as man must, nor receive that dismal sentence for sin and transgression as man shall; this, therefore, is worthy to be considered with seriousness of all that have souls to be saved or damned--'They must one day come to judgment,' there to stand before that Judge of all the earth whose eyes are like a flame of fire, from the sight of which thou canst not hide one of thy words, or thoughts, or actions, because thou wantest the righteousness of God.","The fire of his justice shall burn up all thy rags of righteousness wherewith by the law thou hast clothed thyself, and will leave thee nothing but a soul full of sin to bemoan, and eternal burnings to grapple with.","O the burnings that will then beset sinners on every side, and that will eat their flesh and torment their spirit with far more terror than if they were stricken with scorpions!","And observe it, the torment will there be higher than other where there is the guilt of neglecting Jesus Christ, he being indeed the Saviour, and him that was sent on purpose to deliver men from the wrath to come.",2.,"Consider, once past grace, and ever past grace.","When the door is shut against thee, it will open no more, and then repentings, desires, wishings, and wouldings, come all too late (Luke 13).","Good may be done to others, but to thee, none; and this shall be because, even because thou hast withstood the time of thy visitation, and not received grace when offered: 'My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him' (Luke 19:41-43; Hosea 9:17).","Cain was driven out from the presence of God, for aught I know, some hundreds of years before his death; Ishmael was cast away after seventeen years of age; Esau lived thirty or forty years after he had sold his birthright.",O!,"many, very many are in this condition!","for though God be gracious, yet he will not be slighted nor abused always; there are plenty of sinners in the world--if one will not, another will.","Christ was soon repulsed by and sent away from the country of the Gadarenes; but on the other side of the sea there were many ready with joy to receive him (Luke 8:37,40).","So, when the Jews contradicted and blasphemed, 'the Gentiles gladly received the word' (Acts 13:46-48).","Look to it, sinner, here is life and death set before thee; life, if it be not too late to receive it; but if it be, it is not too late for death to swallow thee up.","And tell me, will it not be dreadful to be carried from under the gospel to the damned, there to lie in endless torment, because thou wouldst not be delivered therefrom?",[39] Will it be comfort to thee to see the Saviour turn Judge?,to see him that wept and died for the sin of the world now ease his mind on Christ-abhorring sinners by rendering to them the just judgment of God?,"For all their abominable filthiness, had they closed with Christ, they had been shrouded from the justice of the law, and should not have come into condemnation.","'But had been passed from death to life'; but they would not take shelter there; they would venture to meet the justice of God in its fury, wherefore now it shall swallow them up for ever and ever.","And let me ask further, is not he a madman who, being loaded with combustible matter, will run headlong into the fire upon a bravado?","or that, being guilty of felony or murder, will desperately run himself into the hand of the officer, as if the law, the judge, the sentence, execution, were but a jest, or a thing to be played withal?","And yet thus mad are poor, wretched, miserable sinners, who, flying from Christ as if he were a viper, they are overcome, and cast off for ever by the just judgment of the law.",But ah!,"how poorly will these be able to plead the virtues of the law to which they have cleaved, when God shall answer them, 'Whom dost thou pass in beauty?","go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised' (Eze 32:19).","Go down to hell, and there be laid with those that refused the grace of God.","Sinners, take my advice, with which I shall conclude this use--Call often to remembrance that thou hast a precious soul within thee; that thou art in the way to thine end, at which thy precious soul will be in special concerned, it being then time to delay no longer, the time of reward being come.","I say again, bring thy end home; put thyself in thy thoughts into the last day thou must live in this world, seriously arguing thus--How if this day were my last?",How if I never see the sun rise more?,"How if the first voice that rings to-morrow morning in my heavy ears be, 'Arise, ye dead, and come to judgment?'","Or how, if the next sight I see with mine eyes be the Lord in the clouds, with all his angels, raining floods of fire and brimstone upon the world?",Am I in a case to be thus near mine end?,to hear this trump of God?,"or to see this great appearance of this great God, and the Lord Jesus Christ?","Will my profession, or the faith I think I have, carry me through all the trials of God's tribunal?","Cannot his eyes, which are as a flame of fire, see in my words, thoughts, and actions enough to make me culpable of the wrath of God?","O how serious should sinners be in this work of remembering things to come, of laying to their heart the greatness and terror of that notable day of God Almighty, and in examining themselves, how it is like to go with their souls when they shall stand before the Judge indeed!","To this end, God make this word effectual.",Amen.,[40] FOOTNOTES: 1.,"These are most important distinctions, upon which depends a right understanding of this doctrine.",God sees the soul either in Christ or in sin.,He may see apparently good works arising from the foulest motives.,Uriah doubtless thought himself highly honoured as a confidential messenger of great king David;

calculated to excite the deepest attention, and to fix the mind upon those solemn realities which alone can unite earth with heaven.","Ho extensive is the meaning of that little sentance, 'Saved by Grace!'","It includes in it redemption from the curse of sin, which oppresses the poor sinner with the fears of everlasting burnings; while it elevates the body, soul, and spirit, to an eternal and an exceeding weight of glory--to the possession of infinite treasures, inconceivable, and that never fade away.","Bunyan, in opening and deeply investigating this subject, shows his master hand in every page.","It was a subject which, from his first conviction of sin, while playing a gat at cat on a Sunday, ahd excited his feelings to an intense degree, absorbing all the powers of his soul.",It was eminently to him the one thing needful--the sum and substance of human habbiness.,"He felt that it included the preservation and re-structure of the body--raised from filth and vileness--from sickness, pain, and disease--from death and the grave--to be perfected in immortality like the Saviour's glorious body.","That included in this salvation, is the death ofdeath, and the swallowing up of the grave, to be no more seen for ever.","The soul will be perfect, and, re-united with the body, be filled 'with bliss and glory, as much as ever it can hold;' all jars and discord between sould and body will be finished; and the perfect man be clothed with righteousness; in a word, be like Christ and with him.","All this is the work of grace, performed by the ever-blessed Trinity.","In displaying the feelings and experience of the inquiring, alarmed, quickened sinner, we are instructed by a continual illustration of the Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.","He manifests profound knowledge of the devices of Satan--the workings of unbelief--the difficulties thrown by the wicked one in the way of the sinner, to prevent his approach to Christ.",He fastens conviction upon conviction--gives blow upon blow to human pride; proving that there can be found nothing in our fallen nature to recommend the sinner to God--all is of grace--from the foundation to the top-stone of a sinner's salvation.,"And above all, he clearly shows that salvation by grace is the most sin-killing doctrine in the world, as well as the most consoling tidings that can be brought to a sin-sick soul.","'O, when a God of grace is upon a throne of grace, and a poor sinner stands by and begs for grace, and that in the name of a gracious Christ, in and by the help of the Spirit of grace, can it be otherwise but that such a sinner must obtain mercy and grace to help in time of need?","O, then, COME BOLDLY!'",p. 360.,"But I must not detain the reader from entering upon this solemn subject;

(verse 15-20).","And lest the Ephesians, at the hearing of these their so many privileges, should forget how little they deserved them, he tells them that in time past they were dead in trespasses and sins, and that then they walked in them ""according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience"" (Eph 2:2,3).","Having thus called them back to the remembrance of themselves--to wit, what they were in their state of unregeneracy, he proceedeth to show them that their first quickening was by the resurrection of Christ their Head, in whom they before were chosen, and that by him they were already set down in heavenly places, (verse 5,6); inserting, by the way, the true cause of all this blessedness, with what else should be by us enjoyed in another world; and that is, the love and grace of God: ""But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ [by grace ye are saved].""","These last words seen to be the apostle's conclusion rightly drawn from the premises; as who should say, If you Ephesians were indeed dead in trespasses and sins; if indeed you were by nature the children of wrath, even as others, then you deserve no more than others.","2 Again, if God hath chosen you, if God hath justified and saved you by his Christ, and left others as good as you by nature to perish in their sins, then the true cause of this your blessed condition is, the free grace of God.","But just thus it is, therefore by grace ye are saved; therefore all the good which you enjoy more than others, it is of mere goodwill.","""BY GRACE YE ARE SAVED.""","The method that I shall choose to discourse upon these words shall be this--I will propound certain questions upon the words, and direct particular answers to them; in which answers I hope I shall answer also, somewhat at least, the expectation of the godly and conscientious reader, and so shall draw towards a conclusion.",THE QUESTIONS ARE-- I.,What is it to be saved?,II.,What is it to be saved by grace?,III.,Who are they that are saved by grace?,IV.,"How it appears that they that are saved, are saved by grace?","V. What might be the reasons which prevailed with God to save us by grace, rather than by any other means?","Now the reason why I propound these five questions upon the words, it is, because the words themselves admit them; the first three are grounded upon the several phrases in the text, and the two last are to make way for demonstration of the whole.",QUEST.,I.--WHAT IS IT TO BE SAVED?,"This question supposeth that there is such a thing as damnation due to man for sin; for to save supposeth the person to be saved to be at present in a sad condition; saving, to him that is not lost, signifies nothing, neither is it anything in itself.","""To save, to redeem, to deliver,"" are in the general terms equivalent, and they do all of them suppose us to be in a state of thraldom and misery; therefore this word ""saved,"" in the sense that the apostle here doth use it, is a word of great worth, forasmuch as the miseries from which we are saved is the misery of all most dreadful.","The miseries from which they that shall be saved shall by their salvation be delivered, are dreadful; they are no less than sin, the curse of God, and flames of hell for ever.",What more abominable than sin?,What more insupportable than the dreadful wrath of an angry God?,And what more fearful than the bottomless pit of hell?,"I say, what more fearful than to be tormented there for ever with the devil and his angels?","Now, to ""save,"" according to my text, is to deliver the sinner from these, with all things else that attend them.","And although sinners may think that it is no hard matter to answer this question, yet I must tell you there is no man, that can feelingly know what it is to be saved, that knoweth not experimentally something of the dread of these three things, as is evident, because all others do even by their practice count it a thing of no great concern, when yet it is of all other of the highest concern among men; ""For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?""",(Matt 16:26).,"But, I say, if this word ""saved"" concludeth our deliverance from sin, how can he tell what it is to be saved that hath not in his conscience groaned under the burden of sin?","yea, it is impossible else that he should ever cry out with all his heart, ""Men and brethren, what shall we do?""","--that is, do to be saved (Acts 2:37).","The man that hath no sores or aches cannot know the virtue of the salve; I mean, not know it from his own experience, and therefore cannot prize, nor have that esteem of it, as he that hath received cure thereby.","Clap a plaster to a well place, and that maketh not its virtue to appear; neither can he to whose flesh it is so applied, by that application understand its worth.","Sinners, you, I mean, that are not wounded with guilt, and oppressed with the burden of sin, you cannot--I will say it again--you cannot know, in this senseless condition of yours, what it is to be saved.","Again; this word ""saved,"" as I said, concludeth deliverance from the wrath of God.","How, then, can he tell what it is to be saved that hath not felt the burden of the wrath of God?","He--he that is astonished with, and that trembleth at, the wrath of God--he knows best what it is to be saved (Acts 16:29).","Further, this word ""saved,"" it concludeth deliverance from death and hell.","How, then, can he tell what it is to be saved that never was sensible of the sorrows of the one, nor distressed with the pains of the other?","The Psalmist says, ""The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.","Then called I upon the name of the Lord""--(mark, then), ""then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul,""--then, in my distress.","When he knew what it was to be saved, then he called, because, I say, then he knew what it was to be saved (Psa 18:4,5; 116:3,4).","I say, this is the man, and this only, that knows what it is to be saved.","And this is evident, as is manifest by the little regard that the rest have to saving, or the little dread they have of damnation.",Where is he that seeks and groans for salvation?,"I say, where is he that hath taken his flight for salvation, because of the dread of the wrath to come?","""O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?""",(Matt 3:7).,Alas!,"do not the most set light by salvation?--as for sin, how do they love it, embrace it, please themselves with it, hide it still within their mouth, and keep it close under their tongue.","Besides, for the wrath of God, they feel it not, they fly not from it; and for hell, it is become a doubt to many if there be any, and a mock to those whose doubt is resolved by atheism.",But to come to the question--What is it to be saved?,"To be saved may either respect salvation in the whole of it, or salvation in the parts of it, or both.","I think this text respecteth both--to wit, salvation completing, and salvation completed; for ""to save"" is a work of many steps; or, to be as plain as possible, ""to save"" is a work that hath its beginning before the world began, and shall not be completed before it is ended.","First, then, we may be said to be saved in the purpose of God before the world began.","The apostle saith that ""he saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began"" (2 Tim 1:9).","This is the beginning of salvation, and according to this beginning all things concur and fall out in conclusion--""He hath saved us according to his eternal purpose, which he purposed in Christ Jesus.""","God in thus saving may be said to save us by determining to make those means effectual for the blessed completing of our salvation; and hence we are said ""to be chosen in Christ to salvation.""","And again, that he hath in that choice given us that grace that shall complete our salvation.","Yea, the text is very full, ""He hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world"" (Eph 1:3,4).",Second.,"As we may be said to be saved in the purpose of God before the foundation of the world, so we may be said to be saved before we are converted, or called to Christ.","And hence ""saved"" is put before ""called""; ""he hath saved us, and called us""; he saith not, he hath called us, and saved us; but he puts saving before calling (2 Tim 1:9).","So again, we are said to be ""preserved in Christ and called""; he saith not, called and preserved (Jude 1).","And therefore God saith again, ""I will pardon them whom I reserve""--that is, as Paul expounds it, those whom I have ""elected and kept,"" and this part of salvation is accomplished through the forbearance of God (Jer 50:20; Rom 11:4,5).","God beareth with is own elect, for Christ's sake, all the time of their unregeneracy, until the time comes which he hath appointed for their conversion.","The sins that we stood guilty of before conversion, had the judgment due to them been executed upon us, we had not now been in the world to partake of a heavenly calling.","But the judgment due to them hath been by the patience of God prevented, and we saved all the time of our ungodly and unconverted state, from that death, and those many hells, that for our sins we deserved at the hands of God.","And here lies the reason that long life is granted to the elect before conversion, and that all the sins they commit and all the judgments they deserve, cannot drive them out of the world before conversion.","Manasseh, you know, was a great sinner, and for the trespass which he committed he was driven from his own land, and carried to Babylon; but kill him they could not, though his sins had deserved death ten thousand times.",But what was the reason?,"Why, he was not yet called; God had chosen him in Christ, and laid up in him a stock of grace, which must be given to Manasseh before he dies; therefore Manasseh must be convinced, converted, and saved.","That legion of devils that was in the possessed, with all the sins which he had committed in the time of his unregeneracy, could not take away his life before his conversion (Mark 5).","How many times was that poor creature, as we may easily conjecture, assaulted for his life by the devils that were in him, yet could they not kill him, yea, though his dwelling was near the sea-side, and the devils had power to drive him too, yet could they not drive him further than the mountains that were by the sea-side; yea, they could help him often to break his chains and fetters, and could also make him as mad as a bedlam, 3 they could also prevail with him to separate from men, and cut himself with stones, but kill him they could not, drown him they could not; he was saved to be called; he was, notwithstanding all this, preserved in Christ, and called.","As it is said of the young lad in the gospel, he was by the devil cast oft into the fire, and oft into the water, to destroy him, but it could not be; even so hath he served others, but they must be ""saved to be called"" (Mark 9:22).",How many deaths have some been delivered from and saved out of before conversion!,"Some have fallen into rivers, some into wells, some into the sea, some into the hands of men; yea, they have been justly arraigned and condemned, as the thief upon the cross, but must not die before they have been converted.","They were preserved in Christ, and called.","Called Christian, how many times have thy sins laid thee upon a sick-bed, and, to thine and others' thinking, at the very mouth of the grave?","yet God said concerning thee, Let him live, for he is not yet converted.","Behold, therefore, that the elect are saved before they are called.","4 ""God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins,"" hath preserved us in Christ, and called us (Eph 2:4,5).","Now this ""saving"" of us arises from six causes.",1.,"God hath chosen us unto salvation, and therefore will not frustrate his own purposes (1 Thess 5:9).",2.,"God hath given us to Christ; and his gift, as well as his calling, is without repentance (Rom 11:29; John 6:37).",3.,"Christ hath purchased us with his blood (Rom 5:8,9).",4.,"They are, by God, counted in Christ before they are converted (Eph 1:3,4).",5.,"They are ordained before conversion to eternal life; yea, to be called, to be justified, to be glorified, and therefore all this must come upon them (Rom 8:29,30).",6.,"For all this, he hath also appointed them their portion and measure of grace, and that before the world began; therefore, that they may partake of all these privileges, they are saved and called, preserved in Christ, and called.",Third.,"To be saved is to be brought to, and helped to lay hold on, Jesus Christ by faith.",And this is called saving by grace through faith.,"""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God"" (Eph 2:8).",1.,"They must be brought unto Christ, yea, drawn unto him; for ""no man,"" saith Christ, ""can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him"" (John 6:44).","Men, even the elect, have too many infirmities to come to Christ without help from heaven; inviting will not do.","""As they called them, so they went from them,"" therefore he ""drew them with cords"" (Hosea 11:2,4).",2.,"As they must be brought to, so they must be helped to lay hold on Christ by faith; for as coming to Christ, so faith, is not in our own power; therefore we are said to be raised up with him ""through the faith of the operation of God.""","And again, we are said to believe, ""according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead"" (Col 2:12; Eph 1:19,20).","Now we are said to be saved by faith, because by faith we lay hold of, venture upon, and put on Jesus Christ for life.","For life, I say, because God having made him the Saviour, hath given him life to communicate to sinners, and the life that he communicates to them is the merit of his flesh and blood, which whoso eateth and drinketh by faith, hath eternal life, because that flesh and blood hath merit in it sufficient to obtain the favour of God.","Yea, it hath done so [since] that day it was offered through the eternal Spirit a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour to him; wherefore God imputeth the righteousness of Christ to him that believeth in him, by which righteousness he is personally justified, and saved from that just judgment of the law that was due unto him (John 5:26, 6:53-58; Eph 4:32; 5:2; Rom 4:23-25).","""Saved by faith.""","For although salvation beginneth in God's purpose, and comes to us through Christ's righteousness, yet is not faith exempted from having a hand in saving of us.","Not that it meriteth aught, but is given by God to those which he saveth, that thereby they may embrace and put on that Christ by whose righteousness they must be saved.",Wherefore this faith is that which here distinguisheth them that shall be saved from them that shall be damned.,"Hence it is said, ""He that believeth not, shall be damned""; and hence again it is that the believers are called ""the children, the heirs, and the blessed with faithful Abraham;"" that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe (Gal 3:6-9,26; Rom 4:13,14).",And here let Christians warily distinguish betwixt the meritorious and the instrumental cause of their justification.,"Christ, with what he hath done and suffered, is the meritorious cause of our justification; therefore he is said to be made to us of God, ""wisdom and righteousness;"" and we are said to be ""justified by his blood, and saved from wrath through him,"" for it was his life and blood that were the price of our redemption (1 Cor 1:30; Rom 5:9,10).","""Redeemed,"" says Peter, ""not with corruptible things, as silver and gold,"" alluding to the redemption of money under the law, ""but with the precious blood of Christ.""","Thou art, therefore, as I have said, to make Christ Jesus the object of thy faith for justification; for by his righteousness thy sins must be covered from the sight of the justice of the law.","""Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.""","""For he shall save his people from their sins"" (Acts 16:31; Matt 1:21).",Fourth.,To be saved is to be preserved in the faith to the end.,"""He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved"" (Matt 24:13).","Not that perseverance is an accident in Christianity, or a thing performed by human industry; they that are saved ""are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation"" (1 Peter 1:3-6).","But perseverance is absolutely necessary to the complete saving of the soul, because he that falleth short of the state that they that are saved are possessed of, as saved, cannot arrive to that saved state.","He that goeth to sea with a purpose to arrive at Spain, cannot arrive there if he be drowned by the way; wherefore perseverance is absolutely necessary to the saving of the soul, and therefore it is included in the complete saving of us--""Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end"" (Isa 45:17).",Perseverance is here made absolutely necessary to the complete saving of the soul.,"But, as I said, this part of salvation dependeth not upon human power, but upon him that hath begun a good work in us (Phil 1:6).","This part, therefore, of our salvation is great, and calleth for no less than the power of God for our help to perform it, as will be easily granted by all those that consider-- 1.","That all the power and policy, malice and rage, of the devils and hell itself are against us.",Any man that understandeth this will conclude that to be saved is no small thing.,"The devil is called a god, a prince, a lion, a roaring lion; it is said that he hath death and the power of it, &c. But what can a poor creature, whose habitation is in flesh, do against a god, a prince, a roaring lion, and the power of death itself?","Our perseverance, therefore, lieth in the power of God; ""the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.""",2.,All the world is against him that shall be saved.,"But what is one poor creature to all the world, especially if you consider that with the world is terror, fear, power, majesty, laws, jails, gibbets, hangings, burnings, drownings, starvings, banishments, and a thousand kinds of deaths?","(1 John 5:4,5; John 16:33).",3.,"Add to this, that all the corruptions that dwell in our flesh are against us, and that not only in their nature and being, but they lust against us, and war against us, to ""bring us into captivity to the law of sin and death"" (Gal 5:17; 1 Peter 2:11; Rom 7:23).",4.,"All the delusions in the world are against them that shall be saved, many of which are so cunningly woven, so plausibly handled, so rarely5 polished with Scripture and reason, that it is ten thousand wonders that the elect are not swallowed up with them; and swallowed up they would be, were they not elect, and was not God himself engaged, either by power to keep them from falling, or by grace to pardon if they fall, and to lift them up again (Matt 24:24; Eph 4:14; Rom 3:12).",5.,"Every fall of the saved is against the salvation of his soul; but a Christian once fallen riseth not but as helped by Omnipotent power--""O Israel, thou hast fallen by thine iniquity,"" ""but in me is thy help,"" says God (Hosea 13:9; 14:1; Psa 37:23).","Christians, were you awake, here would be matter of wonder to you, to see a man assaulted with all the power of hell, and yet to come off a conqueror!","Is it not a wonder to see a poor creature, who in himself is weaker than the moth, to stand against and overcome all devils, all the world, all his lusts and corruptions?",(Job 4:19).,"Or if he fall, is it not a wonder to see him, when devils and guilt are upon him, to rise again, stand upon his feet again, walk with God again, and persevere after all this in the faith and holiness of the gospel?","He that knows himself, wonders; he that knows temptation, wonders; he that knows what falls and guilt mean, wonders; indeed, perseverance is a wonderful thing, and is managed by the power of God; for he only ""is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy"" (Jude 24).","Those of the children of Israel that went from Egypt, and entered the land of Canaan, how came they thither?","Why, the text says, that ""as an eagle spreadeth abroad her wings, so the Lord alone did lead them.""","And again, ""he bore them, and carried them all the days of old"" (Deu 32:11,12; Isa 63:9).","David also tells us that mercy and goodness should follow him all the days of his life, and so he should dwell in the house of the Lord for ever (Psa 23:6).",Fifth.,"To be saved calls for more than all this; he that is saved, must, when this world can hold him no longer, have a safe-conduct to heaven, for that is the place where they that are saved must to the full enjoy their salvation.","This heaven is called ""the end of our faith,"" because it is that which faith looks at; as Peter says, ""Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.""","And again, ""But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul"" (1 Peter 1:9; Heb 10:39).","For, as I said, heaven is the place for the saved to enjoy their salvation in, with that perfect gladness that is not attainable here.","Here we are saved by faith and hope of glory; but there, we that are saved shall enjoy the end of our faith and hope, even the salvation of our souls.","There is ""Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, the general assembly and church of the firstborn;"" there is the ""innumerable company of angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect;"" there is ""God the judge of all, and Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant;"" there shall our soul have as much of heaven as it is capable of enjoying, and that without intermission; wherefore, when we come there we shall be saved indeed!","But now for a poor creature to be brought hither, this is the life of the point.",But how shall I come hither?,"there are heights and depths to hinder (Rom 8:38,39).","Suppose the poor Christian is now upon a sick-bed, beset with a thousand fears, and ten thousand at the end of that; sick-bed fears!","and they are sometimes dreadful ones; fears that are begotten by the review of the sin, perhaps, of forty years' profession; fears that are begotten by dreadful and fearful suggestions of the devil, the sight of death, and the grave, and it may be of hell itself; fears that are begotten by the withdrawing and silence of God and Christ, and by, it may be, the appearance of the devil himself; some of these made David cry, ""O spare me"" a little, ""that I may recover strength before I go hence, and be no more"" (Psa 39:13).","""The sorrows of death,"" said he, ""compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me; I found trouble and sorrow"" (Psa 116:3).","These things, in another place, he calls the bands that the godly have in their death, and the plagues that others are not aware of.","""They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men"" (Psa 73:9).","But now, out of all these, the Lord will save his people; not one sin, nor fear, nor devil shall hinder; nor the grave nor hell disappoint thee.",But how must this be?,"Why, thou must have a safe-conduct to heaven?",6 What conduct?,"A conduct of angels: ""Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?""",(Heb 1:14).,"These angels, therefore, are not to fail them that are the saved; but must, as commissioned of God, come down from heaven to do this office for them; they must come, I say, and take the care and charge of our soul, to conduct it safely into Abraham's bosom.","It is not our meanness in the world, nor our weakness of faith, that shall hinder this; nor shall the loathsomeness of our diseases make these delicate spirits shy of taking this charge upon them.","Lazarus the beggar found this a truth; a beggar so despised of the rich glutton that he was not suffered to come within his gate; a beggar full of sores and noisome putrefaction; yet, behold, when he dies, the angels come from heaven to fetch him thither: ""And it came to pass that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom"" (Luke 16:22).","True, sick-bed temptations are ofttimes the most violent, because then the devil plays his last game with us, he is never to assault us more; besides, perhaps God suffereth it thus to be, that the entering into heaven may be the sweeter, and ring of this salvation the louder!","O it is a blessed thing for God to be our God and our guide even unto death, and then for his angels to conduct us safely to glory; this is saving indeed.","And he shall save Israel ""out of all his troubles;"" out of sick-bed troubles as well as others (Psa 25:22; 34:6; 48:14).",Sixth.,"To be saved, to be perfectly saved, calls for more than all this; the godly are not perfectly saved when their soul is possessed of heaven.","True, their spirit is made perfect, and hath as much of heaven as at present it can hold, but man, consisting of body and soul, cannot be said to be perfectly saved so long as but part of him is in the heavens; his body is the price of the blood of Christ as well as his spirit; his body is the temple of God, and a member of the body, and of the flesh, and of the bones of Christ; he cannot, then, be completely saved until the time of the resurrection of the dead (1 Cor 6:13-19; Eph 5:30).","Wherefore, when Christ shall come the second time, then will he save the body from all those things that at present make it incapable of the heavens.","""For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change"" this ""our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body"" (Phil 3:20,21).","O what a great deal of good God hath put into this little word ""saved""!","We shall not see all the good that God hath put into this word ""saved"" until the Lord Jesus comes to raise the dead.","""It doth not yet appear what we shall be"" (1 John 3:2).","But till it appears what we shall be, we cannot see the bottom of this word ""saved.""","True, we have the earnest of what we shall be, we have the Spirit of God, ""which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession"" (Eph 1:14).","The possession is our body--it is called ""a purchased possession,"" because it is the price of blood; now the redemption of this purchased possession is the raising of it out of the grave, which raising is called the redemption of our body (Rom 8:23).","And when this vile body is made like unto his glorious body, and this body and soul together possessed of the heavens, then shall we be every way saved.",There are three things from which this body must be saved--1.,"There is that sinful filth and vileness that yet dwells in it, under which we groan earnestly all our days (2 Cor 5:1-3).",2.,"There is mortality, that subjecteth us to age, sickness, aches, pains, diseases, and death.",3.,"And there is the grave and death itself, for death is the last enemy that is to be destroyed.","""So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory"" (1 Cor 15:54).","So then, when this comes to pass, then we shall be saved; then will salvation, in all the parts of it, meet together in our glory; then we shall be every way saved--saved in God's decree, saved in Christ's undertakings, saved by faith, saved in perseverance, saved in soul, and in body and soul together in the heavens, saved perfectly, everlastingly, gloriously.",[Of the state of our body and soul in heaven.],"Before I conclude my answer to the first question, I would discourse a little of the state of our body and soul in heaven, when we shall enjoy this blessed state of salvation.",First.,Of the soul; it will then be filled in all the faculties of it with as much bliss and glory as ever it can hold.,1.,"The understanding shall then be perfect in knowledge--""Now we know but in part;"" we know God, Christ, heaven, and glory, but in part; ""but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away"" (1 Cor 13:10).","Then shall we have perfect and everlasting visions of God, and that blessed one his Son Jesus Christ, a good thought of whom doth sometimes so fill us while in this world, that it causeth ""joy unspeakable and full of glory.""",2.,"Then shall our will and affections be ever in a burning flame of love to God and his Son Jesus Christ; our love here hath ups and downs, but there it shall be always perfect with that perfection which is not possible in this world to be enjoyed.",3.,Then will our conscience have that peace and joy that neither tongue nor pen of men or angels can express.,4.,"Then will our memory be so enlarged to retain all things that happened to us in this world, so that with unspeakable aptness we shall call to mind all God's providences, all Satan's malice, all our own weaknesses, all the rage of men, and how God made all work together for his glory and our good, to the everlasting ravishing of our hearts.",Second.,"For our body; it shall be raised in power, in incorruption, a spiritual body and glorious (1 Cor 15:44).",The glory of which is set forth by several things--1.,"It is compared to ""the brightness of the firmament,"" and to the shining of the stars ""for ever and ever"" (Dan 12:3; 1 Cor 15:41,42).",2.,"It is compared to the shining of the sun--""Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.","Who hath ears to hear, let him hear"" (Matt 13:43).",3.,"Their state is then to be equally glorious with angels; ""But they which shall be counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage; neither can they die any more, for they are equal unto the angels"" (Luke 20:35,36).",4.,"It is said that then this our vile body shall be like the glorious body of Jesus Christ (Phil 3:20,21; 1 John 3:2,3).",5.,"And now, when body and soul are thus united, who can imagine what glory they both possess?","They will now be both in capacity, without jarring, to serve the Lord with shouting thanksgivings, and with a crown of everlasting joy upon their head.",8 In this world there cannot be that harmony and oneness of body and soul as there will be in heaven.,"Here the body sometimes sins against the soul, and the soul again vexes and perplexes the body with dreadful apprehensions of the wrath and judgment of God.","While we be in this world, the body oft hangs this way, and the soul the quite contrary; but there, in heaven, they shall have that perfect union as never to jar more; but now the glory of the body shall so suit with the glory of the soul, and both so perfectly suit with the heavenly state, that it passeth words and thoughts.",Third.,Shall I now speak of the place that this saved body and soul shall dwell in?,"Why, 1.","It is a city (Heb 11:16; Eph 2:19,22).",2.,It is called heaven (Heb 10:34).,3.,It is called God's house (John 14:1-3).,4.,It is called a kingdom (Luke 12:32).,5.,It is called glory (Col 3:4; Heb 2:10).,6.,It is called paradise (Rev 2:7).,7.,It is called everlasting habitations (Luke 16:9).,Fourth.,Shall I speak of their company?,"Why, 1.","They shall stand and live in the presence of the glorious God, the Judge of all (Heb 12:23).",2.,"They shall be with the Lamb, the Lord Jesus.",3.,They shall be with an innumerable company of holy angels (Heb 12:22).,4.,"They shall be with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of heaven (Luke 13:28).",Fifth.,Shall I speak of their heavenly raiment?,1.,It is salvation; they shall be clothed with the garment of salvation (Psa 132:16; 149:4; Isa 61:10).,2.,"This raiment is called white raiment, signifying their clean and innocent state in heaven.","""And they,"" says Christ, ""shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy"" (Rev 3:4; 19:8; Isa 57:2).",3.,"It is called glory--""When he shall appear, we shall appear with him in glory"" (Col 3:4).",4.,"They shall also have crowns of righteousness, everlasting joy and glory (Isa 35:10; 2 Tim 4:8; 1 Peter 5:4).",Sixth.,Shall I speak of their continuance in this condition?,1.,It is for ever and ever.,"""And they shall see his face, and his name shall be in their foreheads; and they shall reign for ever and ever"" (Rev 22:4,5).",2.,It is everlasting.,"""And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life"" (John 6:40,47).",3.,It is life eternal.,"""My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give unto them eternal life"" (John 10:27,28).",4.,It is world without end.,"""But Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation; ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end"" (Isa 45:17; Eph 3:20,21).",O sinner!,what sayest thou?,How dost thou like being saved?,Doth not thy mouth water?,Doth not thy heart twitter at being saved?,"Why, come then: ""The Spirit and the bride say, Come.","And let him that heareth say, Come.",And let him that is athirst come.,"And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely"" (Rev 22:17).",QUEST.,II.--WHAT IS IT TO BE SAVED BY GRACE?,"Now I come to the second question--to wit, What is it to be saved by grace?","For so are the words of the text, ""By grace ye are saved.""","But, First.","I must touch a little upon the word GRACE, and show you how diversely it is taken.",Sometimes it is taken for the goodwill and favour of men (Esth 2:17: Ruth 2:2: 1 Sam 1:18: 2 Sam 16:4).,Sometimes it is taken for those sweet ornaments that a life according to the Word of God putteth about the neck 9 (Prov 1:9; 3:22).,"Sometimes it is taken for the charity of the saints, as 2 Corinthians 9:6-8.","But ""grace"" in the text is taken for God's goodwill, ""the goodwill of him that dwelt in the bush;"" and is expressed variously.","Sometimes it is called ""his good pleasure.""","Sometimes, ""the good pleasure of his will,"" which is all one with ""the riches of his grace"" (Eph 1:7).","Sometimes it is expressed by goodness, pity, love, mercy, kindness, and the like (Rom 2:4; Isa 63:9; Titus 3:4,5).","Yea, he styles himself, ""The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty"" (Exo 34:6,7).",Second.,"As the word ""grace"" signifieth all these, so it intimates to us that all these are free acts of God, free love, free mercy, free kindness; hence we have other hints in the Word about the nature of grace, as, 1.","It is an act of God's will, which must needs be free; an act of his own will, of the good pleasure of his will; by each of these expressions is intimated that grace is a free act of God's goodness towards the sons of men.",2.,"Therefore it is expressly said--""Being justified freely by his grace"" (Rom 3:24).",3.,"""And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both"" (Luke 7:42).",4.,"And again, ""Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be it known unto you"" (Eze 36:32; Deu 9:5).",5.,"And therefore ""grace,"" and the deservings of the creature, are set in flat opposition one to another--""And if by grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace.","But if it be of works, then is it no more grace; otherwise work is no more work"" (Rom 11:6).","The word ""grace,"" therefore, being understood, doth most properly set forth the true cause of man's happiness with God, not but that those expressions, love, mercy, goodness, pity, kindness, &c., and the like, have their proper place in our happiness also.","Had not God loved us, grace had not acted freely in our salvation; had not God been merciful, good, pitiful, kind, he would have turned away from us when he saw us in our blood (Eze 16).","So then, when he saith, ""By grace ye are saved,"" it is all one as if he had said, By the goodwill, free mercy, and loving-kindness of God ye are saved; as the words conjoined with the text do also further manifest: ""But God,"" saith Paul, ""who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ [by grace ye are saved].""",[Third.],The words thus understood admit us these few conclusions--1.,"That God, in saving of the sinner, hath no respect to the sinner's goodness; hence it is said he is frankly forgiven, and freely justified (Luke 7:42; Rom 3:24).",2.,"That God doth this to whom and when he pleases, because it is an act of his own good pleasure (Gal 1:15,16).",3.,"This is the cause why great sinners are saved, for God pardoneth ""according to the riches of his grace"" (Eph 1:7).",4.,"This is the true cause that some sinners are so amazed and confounded at the apprehension of their own salvation; his grace is unsearchable; and by unsearchable grace God oft puzzles and confounds our reason (Eze 16:62,63; Acts 9:6).",5.,"This is the cause that sinners are so often recovered from their backslidings, healed of their wounds that they get by their falls, and helped again to rejoice in God's mercy.","Why, he will be gracious to whom he will be gracious, and he will have compassion on whom he will have compassion (Rom 9:15).",[Fourth.],But I must not here conclude this point.,"We are here discoursing of the grace of God, and that by it we are saved; saved, I say, by the grace of God.","Now, God is set forth in the Word unto us under a double consideration--1.","He is set forth in his own eternal power and Godhead; and as thus set forth, we are to conceive of him by his attributes of power, justice, goodness, holiness, everlastingness, &c. 2.","But then, we have him set forth in the Word of truth as consisting of Father, Son, and Spirit; and although this second consideration containeth in it the nature of the Godhead, yet the first doth not demonstrate the persons in the Godhead.","We are saved by the grace of God--that is, by the grace of the Father, who is God; by the grace of the Son, who is God; and by the grace of the Spirit, who is God.","Now, since we are said to be ""saved by grace,"" and that the grace of God; and since also we find in the Word that in the Godhead there are Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, we must conclude that it is by the grace of the Father, Son, and Spirit that we are saved; wherefore grace is attributed to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost distinctly.",1.,"Grace is attributed to the Father, as these scriptures testify; Romans 7:25, 1 Corinthians 1:3, 2 Corinthians 1:2, Galatians 1:3, Ephesians 1:2, Philippians 1:2, Colossians 1:2, 1 Thessalonians 1:1, 2 Thessalonians 1:2, 1 Timothy 1:2, 2 Timothy 1:2, Titus 1:4, Philemon 3.",2.,"Grace is also attributed to the Son, and I first manifest it by all those texts above-mentioned, as also by these that follow: 2 Corinthians 8:9, 13:14, Galatians 6:18, Philippians 4:23, 1 Thessalonians 5:28, 2 Thessalonians 3:18, Philemon 25, Revelation 22:21.",3.,It is also attributed to the Holy Ghost.,"Now, he is here called the Spirit of grace, because he is the author of grace as the Father, and the Son (Zech 12:10; Heb 10:29).","So then, it remaineth that I show you, FIRST, How we are saved by the grace of the Father.","SECOND, How we are saved by the grace of the Son.","And, THIRD, How we are saved by the grace of the Spirit.",Of the Father's grace.,FIRST.,How we are saved by the grace of the Father.,Now this will I open unto you thus-- 1.,"The Father by his grace hath bound up them that shall go to heaven in an eternal decree of election; and here, indeed, as was showed at first, is the beginning of our salvation (2 Tim 1:9).","And election is reckoned not the Son's act, but the Father's--""Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world"" (Eph 1:3,4).","Now this election is counted an act of grace--""So then, at this present time also, there is a remnant according to the election of grace"" (Rom 11:5).",2.,The Father's grace ordaineth and giveth the Son to undertake for us our redemption.,"The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world--""In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus"" (Eph 1:7; 2:7; 1 John 4:14; John 3:16; 6:32,33; 12:49).",3.,"The Father's grace giveth us to Christ to be justified by his righteousness, washed in his blood, and saved by his life.","This Christ mentioneth, and tells us it is his Father's will that they should be safe-coming at the last day, and that he had kept them all the days of his life, and they shall never perish (John 6:37-39; 17:2,12).",4.,"The Father's grace giveth the kingdom of heaven to those that he hath given to Jesus Christ--""Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom"" (Luke 12:32).",5.,"The Father's grace provideth and layeth up in Christ, for those that he hath chosen, a sufficiency of all spiritual blessings, to be communicated to them at their need, for their preservation in the faith, and faithful perseverance through this life; ""not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began"" (2 Tim 1:9; Eph 1:3,4).",6.,The Father's grace saveth us by the blessed and effectual call that he giveth us to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ (1 Col 1:9; Gal 1:15).,7.,"The Father's grace saveth us by multiplying pardons to us, for Christ's sake, day by day--""In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace"" (Eph 1:7).",8.,The Father's grace saves us by exercising patience and forbearance towards us all the time of our unregeneracy (Rom 3:24).,9.,"The Father's grace saveth us by holding of us fast in his hand, and by keeping of us from all the power of the enemy--""My Father,"" said Christ, ""that gave them me, is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand"" (John 10:29).",10.,What shall I say?,"The Father's grace saveth us by accepting of our persons and services, by lifting up the light of his countenance upon us, by manifesting of his love unto us, and by sending of his angels to fetch us to himself, when we have finished our pilgrimage in this world.",Of the grace of the Son.,SECOND.,"I come now to speak of the grace of the Son; for as the Father putteth forth his grace in the saving of the sinner, so doth the Son put forth his--""For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich"" (2 Cor 8:9).",Here you see also that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is brought in as a partner with the grace of his Father in the salvation of our souls.,"Now this is the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; he was rich, but for our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich.","To inquire, then, into this grace, this condescending grace of Christ, and that by searching out how rich Jesus Christ was, and then how poor he made himself, that we through his poverty might have the riches of salvation.",First.,How rich was Jesus Christ?,To which I answer--1.,Generally; 2.,Particularly.,1.,Generally.,"He was rich as the Father--""All things that the Father hath,"" saith he, ""are mine.""","Jesus Christ is the Lord of all, God over all, blessed for ever.","""He thought it not robbery to be equal with God,"" being naturally and eternally God, as the Father, but of his Godhead he could not strip himself (John 10:30; 16:15; Acts 10:36; Phil 2:6; Rom 9:4,5).",2.,Particularly.,"Jesus Christ had glory with the Father; yea, a manifold glory with him, which he stripped himself of.",(1.),"He had the glory of dominion, he was Lord of all the creatures; they were under him upon a double account--(a) as he was their Creator (Col 1:16); (b) as he was made the heir of God (Heb 1:2).",(2.),"Therefore the glory of worship, reverence, and fear from all creatures, was due unto him; the worship, obedience, subjection, and service of angels were due unto him; the fear, honour, and glory of kings, and princes, and judges of the earth were due unto him; the obedience of the sun, moon, stars, clouds, and all vapours, were due unto him; all dragons, deeps, fire, hail, snow, mountains and hills, beasts, cattle, creeping things, and flying fowls, the service of them all, and their worship, were due unto him (Psa 148).",(3.),"The glory of the heavens themselves was due unto him; in a word, heaven and earth were his.",(4.),"But above all, the glory of communion with his Father was his; I say, the glory of that unspeakable communion that he had with the Father before his incarnation, which alone was worth ten thousand worlds, that was ever his.",(5.),"But again; as Jesus Christ was possessed with this, so, besides, he was Lord of life; this glory also was Jesus Christ's: ""In him was life,"" therefore he is called the Prince of it; because it was in him originally as in the Father (Acts 3:15).","He gave to all life and breath, and all things; angels, men, beasts, they had all their life from him.",(6.),"Again, as he was Lord of glory, and Prince of life, so he was also Prince of peace, (Isa 9:6); and by him was maintained that harmony and goodly order which were among things in heaven and things on earth.",Take things briefly in these few particulars--(a.),"The heavens were his, and he made them.",(b.),"Angels were his, and he made them.","(c.) The earth was his, and he made it.","(d.) Man was his, and he made him.",[Second.,How poor he made himself.],"Now this heaven he forsook for our sakes--""He came into the world to save sinners"" (1 Tim 1:15).",[1.],"He was made lower than the angels, for the suffering of death (Heb 2:9).","When he was born, he made himself, as he saith, a worm, or one of no reputation; he became the reproach and byword of the people; he was born in a stable, laid in a manger, earned his bread with his labour, being by trade a carpenter (Psa 22:6; Phil 2:7; Luke 2:7; Mark 6:3).","When he betook himself to his ministry, he lived upon the charity of the people; when other men went to their own houses, Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.","Hark what himself saith for the clearing of this--""Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.""","He denied himself of this world's good (Luke 8:2,3; 9:58; John 7:35; 8:1).",[2.],"Again, as he was Prince of life, so he for our sakes laid down that also; for so stood the matter, that he or we must die; but the grace that was in his heart wrought with him to lay down his life: ""He gave his life a ransom for many.""",He laid down his life that we might have life; he gave his flesh and blood for the life of the world; he laid down his life for his sheep.,[3.],"Again; he was Prince of peace, but he forsook his peace also.",(1.),"He laid aside peace with the world, and chose upon that account to be a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and therefore was persecuted from his cradle to his cross, by kings, rulers, &c.",(2.),"He laid aside his peace with his Father, and made himself the object of his Father's curse, insomuch that the Lord smote, struck, and afflicted him; and, in conclusion, hid his face from him (as he expressed, with great crying) at the hour of his death.",[Object.],"But perhaps some may say, What need was there that Jesus Christ should do all this?",Could not the grace of the Father save us without this condescension of the Son?,Answ.,"As there is grace, so there is justice in God; and man having sinned, God concluded to save him in a way of righteousness; therefore it was absolutely necessary that Jesus Christ should put himself into our very condition, sin only excepted.",1.,"Now by sin we had lost the glory of God, therefore Jesus Christ lays aside the glory that he had with the Father (Rom 3:23; John 17:5).",2.,"Man by sin had shut himself out of an earthly paradise, and Jesus Christ will leave his heavenly paradise to save him (Gen 3:24; 1 Tim 1:15; John 6:38,39).",3.,"Man by sin had made himself lighter than vanity, and this Lord God, Jesus Christ, made himself lower than the angels to redeem him (Isa 40:17;

but Jesus Christ will bear that curse in his own body to save him (Gal 3:13).,7.,"Man by sin had lost peace with God; but this would Jesus Christ lose also, to the end man might be saved.",8.,"Man should have been mocked of God, therefore Christ was mocked of men.",9.,"Man should have been scourged in hell; but, to hinder that, Jesus was scourged on earth.",10.,"Man should have been crowned with ignominy and shame; but, to prevent that, Jesus was crowned with thorns.",11.,"Man should have been pierced with the spear of God's wrath; but, to prevent that, Jesus was pierced both by God and men.",12.,"Man should have been rejected of God and angels; but, to prevent that, Jesus was forsaken of God, and denied, hated, and rejected of men (Isa 48:22; Prov 1:24-26; Matt 27:26,39,46; Psa 9:17; 11:6; 22:7; Dan 12:2; John 19:2-5,37; Num 24:8; Zech 12:10; Luke 9:22).","I might thus enlarge, and that by authority from this text--""He became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.""","All the riches he stripped himself of, it was for our sakes; all the sorrows he underwent, it was for our sakes; to the least circumstance of the sufferings of Christ there was necessity that so it should be, all was for our sakes: ""For our sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.""","And you see the argument that prevailed with Christ to do this great service for man, the grace that was in his heart; as also the prophet saith, ""In his love and in his pity he redeemed them.""","According to this in the Corinthians, ""Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ""; both which agree with the text, ""By grace ye are saved.""","I say, this was the grace of the Son, and the exercise thereof.","The Father therefore shows his grace one way, and the Son his another.","It was not the Father, but the Son, that left his heaven for sinners; it was not the Father, but the Son, that spilt his blood for sinners.","The Father indeed gave the Son, and blessed be the Father for that; and the Son gave his life and blood for us, and blessed be the Son for that.",But methinks we should not yet have done with this grace of the Son.,"Thou Son of the Blessed, what grace was manifest in thy condescension!","Grace brought thee down from heaven, grace stripped thee of thy glory, grace made thee poor and despicable, grace made thee bear such burdens of sin, such burdens of sorrow, such burdens of God's curse as are unspeakable.",O Son of God!,"grace was in all thy tears, grace came bubbling out of thy side with thy blood, grace came forth with every word of thy sweet mouth (Psa 45:2;

for he also saveth us by his grace.,"The Spirit, I told you, is God, as the Father and the Son, and is therefore also the author of grace; yea, and it is absolutely necessary that he put forth his grace also, or else no flesh can be saved.","The Spirit of God hath his hand in saving of us many ways; for they that go to heaven, as they must be beholding to the Father and the Son, so also to the Spirit of God.","The Father chooseth us, giveth us to Christ, and heaven to us, and the like.","The Son fulfills the law for us, takes the curse of the law from us, bears in his own body our sorrows, and sets us justified in the sight of God.","The Father's grace is showed in heaven and earth; the Son's grace is showed on the earth, and on the cross; and the Spirit's grace must be showed in our souls and bodies, before we come to heaven.",Quest.,"But some may say, Wherein doth the saving grace of the Spirit appear?",Answ.,In many things.,"In taking possession of us for his own, in his making of us his house and habitation, so that though the Father and the Son have both gloriously put forth gracious acts in order to our salvation, yet the Spirit is the first that makes seizure of us (1 Cor 3:16; 6:19; Eph 2:21,22).","Christ, therefore, when he went away, said not that he would send the Father, but the Spirit, and that he should be in us for ever--""If I depart,"" said Christ, ""I will send him, the Spirit of truth, the Comforter"" (John 14:16; 16:7,13).","The Holy Spirit coming into us, and dwelling in us, worketh out many salvations for us now, and each of them in order also to our being saved for ever.",1.,"He saveth us from our darkness by illuminating of us; hence he is called ""the Spirit of revelation,"" because he openeth the blind eyes, and so consequently delivereth us from that darkness which else would drown us in the deeps of hell (Eph 1:17,19).",2.,"He it is that convinceth us of the evil of our unbelief, and that shows us the necessity of our believing in Christ; without the conviction of this we should perish (John 16:9).",3.,"This is that finger of God by which the devil is made to give place unto grace, by whose power else we should be carried headlong to hell (Luke 11:20-22).",4.,"This is he that worketh faith in our hearts, without which neither the grace of the Father nor the grace of the Son can save us, ""For he that believeth not, shall be damned"" (Mark 16:16; Rom 15:13).",5.,This is he by whom we are born again; and he that is not so born can neither see nor inherit the kingdom of heaven (John 3:3-7).,6.,"This is he that setteth up his kingdom in the heart, and by that means keepeth out the devil after he is cast out, which kingdom of the Spirit, whoever wanteth, they lie liable to a worse possession of the devil than ever (Matt 12:43-45;

Rom 8:11).",11.,"By this good Spirit we keep that good thing, even the seed of God, that at the first by the Word of God was infused into us, and without which we are liable to the worst damnation (1 John 3:9; 1 Peter 1:23; 2 Tim 1:14).",12.,"By this good Spirit we have help and light against all the wisdom and cunning of the world, which putteth forth itself in its most cursed sophistications to overthrow the simplicity that is in Christ (Matt 10:19,20; Mark 13:11; Luke 12:11,12).",13.,"By this good Spirit our graces are maintained in life and vigour, as faith, hope, love, a spirit of prayer, and every grace (2 Cor 4:13; Rom 15:13; 2 Tim 1:7; Eph 6:18; Titus 3:5).",14.,By this good Spirit we are sealed to the day of redemption (Eph 1:14).,15.,And by this good Spirit we are made to wait with patience until the redemption of the purchased possession comes (Gal 5:5).,"Now all these things are so necessary to our salvation, that I know not which of them can be wanting; neither can any of them be by any means attained but by this blessed Spirit.","And thus have I in few words showed you the grace of the Spirit, and how it putteth forth itself towards the saving of the soul.","And verily, Sirs, it is necessary that you know these things distinctly--to wit, the grace of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the grace of the Holy Ghost; for it is not the grace of one, but of all these three, that saveth him that shall be saved indeed.","The Father's grace saveth no man without the grace of the Son; neither doth the Father and the Son save any without the grace of the Spirit; for as the Father loves, the Son must die, and the Spirit must sanctify, or no soul must be saved.","Some think that the love of the Father, without the blood of the Son, will save them, but they are deceived; for ""without shedding of blood is no remission"" (Heb 9:22).","Some think that the love of the Father and blood of the Son will do, without the holiness of the Spirit of God; but they are deceived also; for ""if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his""; and again, ""without holiness no man shall see the Lord"" (Rom 8:9; Heb 12:14).","There is a third sort, that think the holiness of the Spirit is sufficient of itself; but they (if they had it) are deceived also; for it must be the grace of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the grace of the Spirit, jointly, that must save them.","But yet, as these three do put forth grace jointly and truly in the salvation of a sinner, so they put it forth, as I also have showed you before, after a diverse manner.","The Father designs us for heaven, the Son redeems from sin and death, and the Spirit makes us meet for heaven; not by electing, that is the work of the Father; not by dying, that is the work of the Son; but by his revealing Christ, and applying Christ to our souls, by shedding the love of God abroad in our hearts, by sanctifying of our souls, and taking possession of us as an earnest of our possession of heaven.",QUEST.,III.--WHO ARE THEY THAT ARE TO BE SAVED BY GRACE?,"I come now to the third particular--namely, to show you who they are that are to be saved by grace.",[Who are not saved.],First.,"Not the self-righteous, not they that have no need of the physician.","""The whole have no need of the physician,"" saith Christ.","""I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance"" (Mark 2:17).","And again, ""He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath sent empty away"" (Luke 1:53).","Now when I say not the self-righteous nor the rich, I mean not that they are utterly excluded; for Paul was such an one; but he saveth not such without he first awaken them to see they have need to be saved by grace.",Second.,The grace of God saveth not him that hath sinned the unpardonable sin.,"There is nothing left for him ""but a certain fearful looking for of judgment,--which shall devour the adversaries"" (Heb 10:26,27).",Third.,"That sinner that persevereth in final impenitency and unbelief shall be damned (Luke 13:3,5; Rom 2:2-5; Mark 16:15,16).",Fourth.,"That sinner whose mind the god of this world hath blinded, that the glorious light of the gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, can never shine into him, is lost, and must be damned (2 Cor 4:3,4).",Fifth.,"The sinner that maketh religion his cloak for wickedness, he is a hypocrite, and, continuing so, must certainly be damned (Psa 125:5; Isa 33:14; Matt 24:50,51).",Sixth.,"In a word, every sinner that persevereth in his wickedness, shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven--""Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?","Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.""","""Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience"" (1 Cor 6:9-12; Eph 5:5,6).",[Who are saved.],Question.,But what kind of sinners shall then be saved?,Answ.,"Those of all these kinds that the Spirit of God shall bring [to] the Father by Jesus Christ; these, I say, and none but these, can be saved, because else the sinners might be saved without the Father, or without the Son, or without the Spirit.","Now, in all that I have said, I have not in the least suggested that any sinner is rejected because his sins, in the nature of them, are great; Christ Jesus came into the world to save the chief of sinners.","It is not, therefore, the greatness of, but the continuance in, sins that indeed damneth the sinner.",But I always exclude him that hath sinned against the Holy Ghost.,That it is not the greatness of sin that excludeth the sinner is evident-- 1.,"From the words before the text, which doth give an account of what kind of sinners were here saved by grace, as namely, they that were dead in trespasses and sins, those that walked in these sins, ""according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others"" (Eph 2:2,3).",2.,"It is evident also from the many sinners that we find to be saved, by the revealed will of God.","For in the Word we have mention made of the salvation of great sinners, where their names and their sins stand recorded for our encouragement; as, (1.)","You read of Manasseh, who was an idolater, a witch, a persecutor, yea, a rebel against the word of God, sent unto him by the prophets; and yet this man was saved (2 Chron 33:2-13; 2 Kings 21:16).",(2.),"You read of Mary Magdalene, in whom were seven devils; her condition was dreadful, yet she was saved (Luke 8:2; John 20).",(3.),You read of the man that had a legion of devils in him.,O how dreadful was his condition!,and yet by grace he was saved (Mark 5:1-10).,(4.),"You read of them that murdered the Lord Jesus, and how they were converted and saved (Acts 2:23).",(5.),"You read of the exorcists, how they closed with Christ, and were saved by grace (Acts 19:13).",(6.),"You read of Saul the persecutor, and how he was saved by grace (Acts 9:15).",Object.,"But, thou sayest, I am a backslider.",Answ.,"So was Noah, and yet he found grace in the eyes of the Lord (Gen 9:21,22).","So was Lot, and yet God saved him by grace (Gen 19:35; 2 Peter 2:7-9).","So was David, yet by grace he was forgiven his iniquities (2 Sam 12:7-13).","So was Solomon, and a great one too; yet by grace his soul was saved (Psa 89:28-34).","So was Peter, and that a dreadful one; yet by grace he was saved (Matt 26:69-74; Mark 16:7; Acts 15:7-11).","Besides, for further encouragement, read Jeremiah 3, 33:25,26, 51:5, Ezekiel 36:25, Hosea 14:1-4; and stay thyself, and wonder at the riches of the grace of God.",Quest.,But how should we find out what sinners shall be saved?,"All, it seems, shall not.","Besides, for aught can be gathered by what you have said, there is as bad saved as damned, set him that hath sinned the unpardonable sin aside.",Answ.,"True, there are as bad saved as damned; but to this question: They that are effectually called, are saved.",They that believe on the Son of God shall be saved.,They that are sanctified and preserved in Christ shall be saved.,"They that take up their cross daily, and follow Christ, shall be saved.","Take a catalogue of them thus: ""Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved"" (Mark 16:16; Acts 16:31).","""If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved"" (Rom 10:9).","Be justified by the blood of Christ, and thou shalt be saved (Rom 5:9).","Be reconciled to God by the death of his Son, and thou shalt be saved by his life (Rom 5:10).","""And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved"" (Acts 2:21).",See some other scriptures.,"""He shall save the humble person"" (Job 22:29).","""Thou wilt save the afflicted people"" (Psa 18:27).","""He shall save the children of the needy"" (Psa 72:4).","""He shall save the souls of the needy"" (Psa 72:13).","""O thou, my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee"" (Psa 86:2).","""He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him, he also will hear their cry, and will save them"" (Psa 145:19).",[Caution.],"But, sinner, if thou wouldst indeed be saved, beware of these four things-- 1.","Beware of delaying repentance; delays are dangerous and damnable; they are dangerous, because they harden the heart; they are damnable, because their tendency is to make thee outstand the time of grace (Psa 95:7; Heb 3-12).",2.,"Beware of resting in the word of the kingdom, without the spirit and power of the kingdom of the gospel; for the gospel coming in word only saves nobody, for the kingdom of God or the gospel, where it comes to salvation, is not in word but in power (1 Thess 1:4-6; 1 Cor 4:19).",3.,"Take heed of living in a profession, a life that is provoking to God; for that is the way to make him cast thee away in his anger.",4.,"Take heed that thy inside and outside be alike;, and both conformable to the Word of his grace; labour to be like the living creatures which thou mayest read of in the book of the prophet Ezekiel, whose appearance and themselves were one 10 (Eze 10:22).","In all this, I have advertised you not to be content without the power and Spirit of God in your hearts, for without him you partake of none of the grace of the Father or Son, but will certainly miss of the salvation of the soul.",QUEST.,"IV.--HOW IT APPEARS THAT THEY THAT ARE SAVED, ARE SAVED BY GRACE?","This fourth question requireth that some demonstration be given of the truth of this doctrine--to wit, that they that are saved are saved by grace.","What hath been said before hath given some demonstration of the truth; wherefore, first repeating in few words the sum of what hath been said already, I shall come to further proof.",1.,"That this is true, the Scriptures testify, because God chose them to salvation before they had done good (Rom 9:11).",2.,Christ was ordained to be their Saviour before the foundation of the world (Eph 1:4; 1 Peter 1:19-21).,3.,"All things that concur and go to our salvation were also in the same laid up in Christ, to be communicated in the dispensation of the fullness of times, to them that shall be saved (Eph 1:3,4; 2 Tim 1:9; Eph 1:10; 3:8-11; Rom 8:30).",[That salvation is by grace appears in its contrivance.],"Again, as their salvation was contrived by God, so, as was said, this salvation was undertaken by one of the three; to wit, the Son of the Father (John 1:29; Isa 48:16).","Had there been a contrivance in heaven about the salvation of sinners on earth, yet if the result of that contrivance had been that we should be saved by our own good deeds, it would not have been proper for an apostle, or an angel, to say, ""By grace ye are saved.""","But now, when a council is held in eternity about the salvation of sinners in time, and when the result of that council shall be, that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost will themselves accomplish the work of this salvation, this is grace, this is naturally grace, grace that is rich and free; yea, this is unthought-of grace.","I will say it again, this is unthought-of grace; for who could have thought that a Saviour had been in the bosom of the Father, or that the Father would have given him to be the Saviour of men, since he refused to give him to be the Saviour of angels?","(Heb 2:16,17).",[Grace appears in the Son's undertaking this work.],"Again; could it have been thought that the Father would have sent his Son to be the Saviour, we should, in reason, have thought also that he would never have taken the work wholly upon himself, especially that fearful, dreadful, soul-astonishing, and amazing part thereof!","Who could once have imagined that the Lord Jesus would have made himself so poor as to stand before God in the nauseous rags of our sins, and subject himself to the curse and death that were due to our sin?",but thus he did to save us by grace.,"""Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved; in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace"" (Eph 1:3-7).",[Grace appears in the terms and conditions on which salvation is made over.],"Again; if we consider the terms and conditions upon which this salvation is made over to them that are saved, it will further appear we are saved by grace.",1.,"The things that immediately concern our justification and salvation, they are offered, yea, given to us freely, and we are commanded to receive them by faith.","Sinner, hold up thy lap.","God so loved the world, that he giveth his Son, that he giveth his righteousness, that he giveth his Spirit, and the kingdom of heaven (John 3:16; Rom 5:17; 2 Cor 1:21,22; Luke 12:32).",2.,"He also giveth repentance, he giveth faith, and giveth everlasting consolation, and good hope through grace (Acts 5:30,31; Phil 1:29; 2 Thess 2:16).",3.,"He giveth pardon, and giveth more grace, to keep us from sinking into hell, than we have sin to sink us in thither (Acts 5:31; Prov 3:34; John 4:6; 1 Peter 5:5).",4.,He hath made all these things over to us in a covenant of grace.,"We call it a covenant of grace, because it is set in opposition to the covenant of works, and because it is established to us in the doings of Christ, founded in his blood, established upon the best promises made to him, and to us by him.","""For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him amen, to the glory of God by us"" (2 Cor 1:20).","But to pass these, and to come to some other demonstrations for the clearing of this-- Let us a little consider, What man is, upon whom the Father, the Son, and the Spirit bestows this grace.",1.,[An enemy to God.],"By nature he is an enemy to God, an enemy in his mind.","""The carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be"" (Rom 8:7; Col 1:21).",2.,[A slave to sin.],"So that the state of man was this--he was not only over persuaded on a sudden to sin against God, but he drank this sin, like water, into his very nature, mingled it with every faculty of his soul and member of his body; by the means of which he became alienated from God, and an enemy to him in his very heart; and wilt thou, O Lord, as the Scripture hath it, ""And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one?""",(Job 14:3).,"Yea, open thy heart, and take this man, not into judgment, but into mercy with thee?",3.,[In covenant with death and hell.],"Further, man by his sin had not only given himself to be a captive slave to the devil, but, continuing in his sin, he made head against his God, struck up a covenant with death, and made an agreement with hell; but for God to open his eyes upon such an one, and to take hold of him by riches of grace, this is amazing (Isa 28:16-18).","See where God found the Jew when he came to look upon him to save him--""As for thy nativity,"" says God, ""in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.","None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the loathing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.","And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, Live.--Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness; yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine.""","Sinner, see further into the chapter, Ezekiel 16.",All this is the grace of God; every word in this text smells of grace.,"But before I pass this, let us a little take notice of The carriage of God to man, and again of man to God, in his conversion.",FIRST.,OF GOD'S CARRIAGE TO MAN.,"He comes to him while he is in his sins, in his blood; he comes to him now, not in the heat and fire of his jealousy, but ""in the cool of the day,"" in unspeakable gentleness, mercy, pity, and bowels of love; not in clothing himself with vengeance, but in a way of entreaty, and meekly beseecheth the sinner to be reconciled unto him (2 Cor 5:19,20).","It is expected among men that he which giveth the offence should be the first in seeking peace; but, sinner, betwixt God and man it is not so; not that we loved God, not that we chose God; but ""God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.""","God is the first that seeketh peace; and, as I said, in a way of entreaty he bids his ministers pray you in Christ's stead; ""as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you, in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.""","O sinner, wilt thou not open?","Behold, God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ stand both at the door of thy heart, beseeching there for favour from thee, that thou wilt be reconciled to them, with promise, if thou wilt comply, to forgive thee all thy sins.",O grace!,O amazing grace!,"To see a prince entreat a beggar to receive an alms would be a strange sight; to see a king entreat the traitor to accept of mercy would be a stranger sight than that; but to see God entreat a sinner, to hear Christ say, ""I stand at the door and knock,"" with a heart full and a heaven full of grace to bestow upon him that opens, this is such a sight as dazzles the eyes of angels.","What sayest thou now, sinner?",Is not this God rich in mercy?,Hath not this God great love for sinners?,"Nay, further, that thou mayest not have any ground to doubt that all this is but complementing, thou hast also here declared that God hath made his Christ ""to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.""","If God would have stuck at anything, he would have stuck at the death of his Son; but he ""delivered him up for us"" freely; ""how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?""",(Rom 8:32).,11 But this is not all.,"God doth not only beseech thee to be reconciled to him, but further, for thy encouragement, he hath pronounced, in thy hearing, exceeding great and precious promises; ""and hath confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us"" (Heb 6:18,19; Isa 1:18; 55:6,7; Jer 51:5).",SECOND.,OF MAN'S CARRIAGE TO GOD.,"Let us come now to the carriage of these sinners to God, and that from the first day he beginneth to deal with their souls, even to the time that they are to be taken up into heaven.","And, First.","To begin with God's ordinary dealing with sinners, when at first he ministereth conviction to them by his Word, how strangely do they behave themselves!","They love not to have their consciences touched; they like not to ponder upon what they have been, what they are, or what is like to become of them hereafter; such thoughts they count unmanly, hurtful, disadvantageous; therefore ""they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear"" (Zech 7,11).","And now they are for anything rather than the Word; an alehouse, a whorehouse, a playhouse, sports, pleasures, sleep, the world, and what not so they may stave12 off the power of the word of God.",Second.,"If God now comes up closer to them, and begins to fasten conviction upon the conscience, though such conviction be the first step to faith and repentance, yea, and to life eternal, yet what shifts will they have to forget them, and wear them off!","Yea, although they now begin to see that they must either turn or burn, 13 yet oftentimes even then they will study to wave a present conversion: they object, they are too young to turn yet; seven years hence time enough, when they are old, or come upon a sick-bed.",O what an enemy is man to his own salvation!,"I am persuaded that God hath visited some of you often with his Word, even twice and thrice, and you have thrown water as fast as he hath by the Word cast fire upon your conscience.","14 Christian, what had become of thee if God had taken thy denial for an answer, and said, Then will I carry the word of salvation to another, and he will hear it?","Sinner, turn, says God.","Lord, I cannot tend15 it, says the sinner.","Turn or burn, says God.","I will venture that, says the sinner.","Turn, and be saved, says God.","I cannot leave my pleasures, says the sinner: sweet sins, sweet pleasures, sweet delights, says the sinner.",But what grace is it in God thus to parley with the sinner!,O the patience of God to a poor sinner!,"What if God should now say, Then get thee to thy sins, get thee to thy delights, get thee to thy pleasures, take them for thy portion, they shall be all thy heaven, all thy happiness, and all thy portion?",Third.,"But God comes again, and shows the sinner the necessity of turning now; now or not at all; yea, and giveth the sinner this conviction so strongly, that he cannot put it off.","But behold, the sinner has one spark of enmity still.","If he must needs turn now, he will either turn from one sin to another, from great ones to little ones, from many to few, or from all to one, and there stop.",But perhaps convictions will not thus leave him.,"Why, then, he will turn from profaneness to the law of Moses, and will dwell as long as God will let him upon his own seeming goodness.","And now observe him, he is a great stickler for legal performance; now he will be a good neighbour, he will pay every man his own, will leave off his swearing, the alehouse, his sports, and carnal delights; he will read, pray, talk of Scripture, and be a very busy one in religion, such as it is; now he will please God, and make him amends for all the wrong he hath done him, and will feed him with chapters, and prayers, and promises, and vows, and a great many more such dainty dishes as these, persuading himself that now he must needs be fair for heaven, and thinks besides that he serveth God as well as any man in England can.","16 But all this while he is as ignorant of Christ as the stool he sits on, and no nearer heaven than was the blind Pharisee; only he has got in a cleaner way to hell than the rest of his neighbours are in--""There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness"" (Prov 30:12).","Might not God now cut off this sinner, and cast him out of his sight; might he not leave him here to his own choice, to be deluded by, and to fall in his own righteousness, because he ""trusteth to it, and commits iniquity""?",(Eze 33:13).,"But grace, preventing grace, preserves him.","It is true, this turn of the sinner, as I said, is a turning short of Christ; but, Fourth.","God in this way of the sinner will mercifully follow him, and show him the shortness of his performances, the emptiness of his duties, and the uncleanness of his righteousness (Isa 28:20; 64:6).","Thus I speak of the sinner, the salvation of whose soul is graciously intended and contrived of God; for he shall by gospel light be wearied out of all; he shall be made to see the vanity of all, and that the personal righteousness of Jesus Christ, and that only, is it which of God is ordained to save the sinner from the due reward of his sins.","But behold, the sinner now, at the sight and sense of his own nothingness, falleth into a kind of despair; for although he hath it in him to presume of salvation, through the delusiveness of his own good opinion of himself, yet he hath it not in himself to have a good opinion of the grace of God in the righteousness of Christ; wherefore he concludeth, that if salvation be alone of the grace of God, through the righteousness of Christ, and that all of a man's own is utterly rejected, as to the justification of his person with God, then he is cast away.","Now the reason of this sinking of heart is the sight that God hath given him, a sight of the uncleanness of his best performance; the former sight of his immoralities did somewhat distress him, and make him betake himself to his own good deeds to ease his conscience, wherefore this was his prop, his stay; but behold, now God hath taken this from under him, and now he falls; wherefore his best doth also now forsake him, and flies away like the morning dew, or a bird, or as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind, and the smoke out of a chimney (Hosea 9:11; 13:3).","Besides, this revelation of the emptiness of his own righteousness, brings also with it a further discovery of the naughtiness of his heart, in its hypocrisies, pride, unbelief, hardness of heart, deadness, and backwardness to all gospel and new-covenant obedience, which sight of himself lies like millstones upon his shoulders, and sinks him yet further into doubts and fears of damnation.","For, bid him now receive Christ, he answers he cannot, he dares not.","Ask him why he cannot, he will answer he has no faith, nor hope in his heart.","Tell him that grace is offered him freely, he says, but I have no heart to receive it; besides, he finds not, as he thinks, any gracious disposition in his soul, and therefore concludes he doth not belong to God's mercy, nor hath an interest in the blood of Christ, and therefore dares not presume to believe; wherefore, as I said, he sinks in his heart, he dies in his thoughts, he doubts, he despairs, and concludes he shall never be saved.",Fifth.,"But behold, the God of all grace leaveth him not in this distress, but comes up now to him closer than ever; he sends the Spirit of adoption, the blessed Comforter, to him, to tell him, ""God is love,"" and therefore not willing to reject the broken in heart; bids him cry and pray for an evidence of mercy to his soul, and says, ""Peradventure you may be hid in the day of the Lord's anger.""","At this the sinner takes some encouragement, yet he can get no more than that which will hang upon a mere probability, which by the next doubt that ariseth in the heart is blown quite away, and the soul left again in his first plight, or worse, where he lamentably bewails his miserable state, and is tormented with a thousand fears of perishing, for he hears not a word from heaven, perhaps for several weeks together.","Wherefore unbelief begins to get the mastery of him, and takes off the very edge and spirit of prayer, and inclination to hear the Word any longer; yea, the devil also claps in with these thoughts, saying that all your prayers, and hearing, and reading, and godly company which you frequent, will rise up in judgment against you at last; therefore better it is, if you must be damned, to choose as easy a place in hell as you can.","The soul at this, being quite discouraged, thinks to do as it hath been taught, and with dying thoughts it begins to faint when it goeth to prayer or to hear the word; but behold, when all hope seems to be quite gone, and the soul concludes, I DIE, I PERISH, in comes, on a sudden, the Spirit of God again, with some good word of God, which the soul never thought of before, which word of God commands a calm in the soul, makes unbelief give place, encourageth to hope and wait upon God again; perhaps it gives some little sight of Christ to the soul, and of his blessed undertaking for sinners.","But behold, so soon as the power of things does again begin to wear off the heart, the sinner gives place to unbelief, questions God's mercy, and fears damning again; he also entertains hard thoughts of God and Christ, and thinks former encouragements were fancies, delusions, or mere think-so's.",And why doth not God now cast the sinner to hell for his thus abusing his mercy and grace.,O no!,"""He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and he will have compassion on whom he will have compassion""; wherefore ""goodness and mercy shall follow him all the days of his life, that he may dwell in the house of the Lord for ever"" (Psa 23:6).",Sixth.,"God, therefore, after all these provocations, comes by his Spirit to the soul again, and brings sealing grace and pardon to the conscience, testifying to it that its sins are forgiven, and that freely, for the sake of the blood of Christ; and now has the sinner such a sight of the grace of God in Christ as kindly breaks his heart with joy and comfort; now the soul knows what it is to eat promises; it also knows what it is to eat and drink the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ by faith; now it is driven by the power of his grace to its knees, to thank God for forgiveness of sins and for hopes of an inheritance amongst them that are sanctified by faith which is in Christ; now it hath a calm and sunshine; now ""he washeth his steps with butter, and the rock pours him out rivers of oil"" (Job 29:6).",Seventh.,"But after this, perhaps the soul grows cold again, it also forgets this grace received, and waxeth carnal, begins again to itch after the world, loseth the life and savour of heavenly things, grieves the Spirit of God, woefully backslides, casteth off closet duties quite, or else retains only the formality of them, is a reproach to religion, grieves the hearts of them that are awake, and tender of God's name, &c. But what will God do now?",Will he take this advantage to destroy the sinner?,No.,Will he let him alone in his apostasy?,No.,Will he leave him to recover himself by the strength of his now languishing graces?,No.,What then?,"Why, he will seek this man out till he finds him, and bring him home to himself again: ""For thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.","As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among the sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered.--I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick"" (Eze 34:11,16).","Thus he dealt with the man that went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves; and thus he dealt with the prodigal you read of also (Luke 10:30-35; 15:20).","Of God's ordinary way of fetching the backslider home I will not now discourse--namely, whether he always breaketh his bones for his sins, as he broke David's; or whether he will all the days of their life, for this, leave them under guilt and darkness; or whether he will kill them now, that they may not be damned in the day of judgment, as he dealt with them at Corinth (1 Cor 11:30-32).","He is wise, and can tell how to embitter backsliding to them he loveth.","He can break their bones, and save them; he can lay them in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deep, and save them; he can slay them as to this life, and save them.","And herein again appears wonderful grace, that ""Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah of his God, though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel"" (Jer 51:5).",Eighth.,"But suppose God deals not either of these ways with the backslider, but shines upon him again, and seals up to him the remission of his sins a second time, saying, ""I will heal their backslidings, and love them freely,"" what will the soul do now?","Surely it will walk humbly now, and holily all its days.","It will never backslide again, will it?","It may happen it will not, it may happen it will; it is just as his God keeps him; for although his sins are of himself, his standing is of God; I say, his standing, while he stands, and his recovery, if he falls, are both of God; wherefore, if God leaves him a little, the next gap he finds, away he is gone again.","""My people,"" says God, ""are bent to backsliding from me.""","How many times did David backslide; yea, Jehoshaphat and Peter!","(2 Sam 11,24; 2 Chron 19:1-3; 20:1-5; Matt 26:69-71; Gal 2:11-13).","As also in the third of Jeremiah it is said, ""But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers, yet return unto me, saith the Lord"" (verse 1).",Here is grace!,"So many time as the soul backslides, so many times God brings him again--I mean, the soul that must be saved by grace--he renews his pardons, and multiplies them.","""Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man"" (Job 33:29).",Ninth.,But see yet more grace.,"I will speak here of heart-wanderings, and of daily miscarriages--I mean, of these common infirmities that are incident to the best of saints, and that attend them in their best performances; not that I intend, for I cannot, mention them particularly, that would be a task impossible; but such there are, worldly thoughts, unclean thoughts, too low thoughts of God, of Christ, of the Spirit, words, ways, and ordinances of God, by which a Christian transgresses many times; may I not say, sometimes many hundred times a day; yea, for aught I know, there are some saints, and them not long-lived either, that must receive, before they enter into life, millions of pardons from God for these; and every pardon is an act of grace, through the redemption that is in Christ's blood.","17 Seventy times seven times a day we sometimes sin against our brother; but how many times, in that day, do we sin against God?","Lord, ""who can understand his errors?","cleanse thou me from secret faults"" [sins], said David.","And again, ""If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?","But there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared"" (Matt 18:21,22; Psa 19:12; 130:3,4).",But to mention some of them.,"Sometimes they question the very being of God, or foolishly ask how he came to be at first; sometimes they question the truth of his Word, and suspect the harmony thereof, because their blind hearts and dull heads cannot reconcile it; yea, all fundamental truths lie open sometimes to the censure of their unbelief and atheism; as, namely, whether there be such an one as Christ, such a thing as the day of judgment, or whether there will be a heaven or hell hereafter, and God pardons all these by his grace.","When they believe these things, even then they sin, by not having such reverent, high, and holy thoughts of them as they ought; they sin also by having too, too good thoughts of themselves, of sin, and the world; sometimes, let me say, often, they wink too much at known sin, they bewail not, as they should, the infirmities of the flesh; the itching inclinations which they find in their hearts after vanity go too often from them unrepented of.",I do not say but they repent them in the general.,"But all these things, O how often doth God forgive, through the riches of his grace!","They sin by not walking answerably to mercies received; yea, they come short in their thanks to God for them, even then when they most heartily acknowledge how unworthy they are of them; also, how little of the strength of them is spent to his praise, who freely poureth them into their bosoms; but from all these sins are they saved by grace.","They sin in their most exact and spiritual performance of duties; they pray not, they hear not, they read not, they give not alms, they come not to the Lord's table, or other holy appointments of God, but in and with much coldness, deadness, wanderings of heart, ignorance, misapprehensions, &c. They forget God while they pray unto him; they forget Christ while they are at his table; they forget his Word even while they are reading of it.","How often do they make promises to God, and afterwards break them!","Yea, or if they keep promise in show, how much doth their heart even grudge the performing of them; how do they shuck18 at the cross; and how unwilling are they to lose that little they have for God, though all they have was given them to glorify him withal!","19 All these things, and a thousand times as many more, dwell in the flesh of man; and they may as soon go away from themselves as from these corruptions; yea, they may sooner cut the flesh from their bones than these motions of sin from their flesh; these will be with them in every duty--I mean, some or other of them; yea, as often as they look, or think, or hear, or speak.","These are with them, especially when the man intends good in so doing: ""When I would do good,"" says Paul, ""evil is present with me.""","And God himself complains that ""every imagination of the thoughts of the heart of man is only evil,"" and that ""continually"" (Rom 7:21; Gen 6:5).","By these things, therefore, we continually defile ourselves, and every one of our performances--I mean, in the judgment of the law--even mixing iniquity with those things which we hallow unto the Lord.","""For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness; all these evil things come from within, and defile the man"" (Mark 7:21-23).",Now what can deliver the soul from these but grace?,"""By grace ye are saved.""",QUEST.,"V.--WHAT MIGHT BE THE REASON MOVED GOD TO ORDAIN AND CHOOSE TO SAVE THOSE THAT HE SAVETH BY HIS GRACE, RATHER THAN BY ANY OTHER MEANS?","I come now to answer the fifth question; namely, to show why God saveth those that he saveth by grace, rather than by any other means.",First.,"God saveth us by grace, because since sin is in the world, he can save us no other way; sin and transgression cannot be removed but by the grace of God through Christ; sin is the transgression of the law of God, who is perfectly just.","Infinite justice cannot be satisfied with the recompence that man can make; for if it could, Christ Jesus himself needed not to have died; besides, man having sinned, and defiled himself thereby, all his acts are the acts of a defiled man; nay, further, the best of his performances are also defiled by his hands; these performances, therefore, cannot be a recompence for sin.","Besides, to affirm that God saveth defiled man for the sake of his defiled duties--for so, I say, is every work of his hand--what is it but to say, God accepteth of one sinful act as a recompence and satisfaction for another?",(Hag 2:14).,"But God, even of old, hath declared how he abominates imperfect sacrifices, therefore we can by no means be saved from sin but by grace (Rom 3:24).",Second.,"To assert that we may be saved any other way than by the grace of God, what is it but to object against the wisdom and prudence of God, wherein he aboundeth towards them whom he hath saved by grace?",(Eph 1:5-8).,"His wisdom and prudence found out no other way, therefore he chooseth to save us by grace.",Third.,"We must be saved by grace, because else it follows that God is mutable in his decrees, for so hath he determined before the foundation of the world; therefore he saveth us not, nor chooseth to save us by any other way, than by grace (Eph 1:3,4; 3:8-11; Rom 9:23).",Fourth.,"If man should be saved any other way than by grace, God would be disappointed in his design to cut off boasting from his creature; but God's design to cut off boasting from his creature cannot be frustrated or disappointed; therefore he will save man by no other means than by grace; he, I say, hath designed that no flesh should glory in his presence, and therefore he refuseth their works; ""Not of works, lest any man should boast.""","""Where is boasting then?",It is excluded.,By what law?,of works?,"Nay; but by the law of faith"" (Eph 2:8,9; Rom 3:24-28).",Fifth.,"God hath ordained that we should be saved by grace, that he might have the praise and glory of our salvation; that we should be ""to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved"" (Eph 1:6).","Now God will not lose his praise, and his glory he will not give to another; therefore God doth choose to save sinners but by his grace.",Sixth.,"God hath ordained, and doth choose to save us by grace, because, were there another way apparent, yet this is the way that is safest, and best secureth the soul.","""Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise [the promise of eternal inheritance, (Heb 9:14-16)] might be sure to all the seed"" (Rom 4:16).",No other way could have been sure.,"This is evident in Adam, the Jews, and, I will add, the fallen angels, who being turned over to another way than grace, you see in short time what became of them.",To be saved by grace supposeth that God hath taken the salvation of our souls into his own hand; and to be sure it is safer in God's hand than ours.,"Hence it is called the salvation of the Lord, the salvation of God, and salvation, and that of God.","When our salvation is in God's hand, himself is engaged to accomplish it for us.",1.,Here is the mercy of God engaged for us (Rom 9:15).,2.,"Here is the wisdom of God engaged for us (Eph 1:7,8).",3.,Here is the power of God engaged for us (1 Peter 1:3-5).,4.,"Here is the justice of God engaged for us (Rom 3:24,25).",5.,Here is the holiness of God engaged for us (Psa 89:30-35).,6.,"Here is the care of God engaged for us, and his watchful eye is always over us for our good (1 Peter 5:7; Isa 27:1-3).",What shall I say?,"Grace can take us into favour with God, and that when we are in our blood (Eze 16:7,8).","Grace can make children of us, though by nature we have been enemies to God (Rom 9:25,26).","Grace can make them God's people which were not God's people (1 Peter 2:9,10).","Grace will not trust our own salvation in our own hands--""He putteth no trust in his saints"" (Job 15:15).","Grace can pardon our ungodliness, justify us with Christ's righteousness; it can put the spirit of Jesus Christ within us, it can help us up when we are down, it can heal us when we are wounded, it can multiply pardons, as we, through frailty, multiply transgressions.",What shall I say?,Grace and mercy are everlasting.,They are built up for ever.,They are the delight of God.,They rejoice against judgment.,"And therefore it is the most safe and secure way of salvation, and therefore hath God chosen to save us by his grace and mercy rather than any other way (Isa 43:25; Rom 3:24,25; Isa 44:2,4; Psa 37:23; Luke 10:33,34; Isa 55:7,8; Psa 136; 89:2; Mal 3:18; James 2:13).",Seventh.,"We must be saved by the grace of God, or else God will not have his will.","They that are saved are ""predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace"" (Eph 1:5,6).",1.,"But if it be his will that men should be saved by grace, then to think of another way is against the will of God.","Hence they that seek to establish their own righteousness are such as are accounted to stand out in defiance against, and that do not submit to, the righteousness of God--that is, to the righteousness that he hath willed to be that through which alone we are saved by grace (Rom 10:3).",2.,"If it be his will that men should be saved through grace, then it is his will that men should be saved by faith in that Christ who is the contrivance of grace; therefore they that have sought to be justified another way have come short of, and perished notwithstanding, that salvation that is provided of God for men by grace (Rom 9:31-33).",3.,"God is not willing that faith should be made void, and the promise of none effect; therefore they of the righteousness of the law are excluded: ""for if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise, but God gave it to Abraham by promise"" (Rom 4:14 Gal 3:18).",4.,"God is not willing that men should be saved by their own natural abilities; but all the works of the law which men do to be saved by, they are the works of men's natural abilities, and are therefore called the work of the flesh, but God is not willing that men should be saved by these, therefore no way but by his grace (Rom 4:1; Gal 3:1-3; Phil 3:3).",Eighth.,"We must be saved by grace, or else the main pillars and foundations of salvation are not only shaken, but overthrown--to wit, election, the new covenant, Christ, and the glory of God; but these must not be overthrown; therefore we must be saved by grace.",1.,"Election, which layeth hold of men by the grace of God, God hath purposed that that shall stand--the election of God standeth sure; therefore men must be saved by virtue of the election of grace (Rom 9:11; 2 Tim 2:19).",2.,"The covenant of grace, that must stand--""Brethren, I speak after the manner of men.","Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed [as this is, by the death of the testator, (Heb 9:16,17)] no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto""; therefore man must be saved by virtue of a covenant of grace (Gal 3:15).",3.,"Christ, who is the gift of the grace of God to the world, he must stand, because he is a sure foundation, ""the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever""; therefore men must be saved by grace, through the redemption that is in Christ (Isa 28:16; Heb 13:8).",4.,"God's glory, that also must stand; to wit, the glory of his grace; for that he will not give to another; therefore men must so be saved from the wrath to come, that in their salvation praise may redound to the glory of his grace.",Ninth.,"There can be but one will the master in our salvation; but that shall never be the will of man, but of God; therefore man must be saved by grace (John 1:13; Rom 9:16).",Tenth.,"There can be but one righteousness that shall save a sinner; but that shall never be the righteousness of men, but of Christ (therefore men must be saved by grace), that imputeth this righteousness to whom he will.",Eleventh.,"There can be but one covenant by which men must be saved; but that shall never be the covenant of the law, for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof; therefore men must be saved by the covenant of grace, by which God will be merciful to our unrighteousnesses, and our sins and iniquities will remember no more (Heb 8:6-13).",POSTSCRIPT.,"A few words by way of use, and so I shall conclude.",THE FIRST USE.,First.,Is the salvation of the sinner by the grace of God?,Then here you see the reason why God hath not respect to the personal virtues of men in the bringing of them to glory.,"Did I say, personal virtues?",How can they have any to Godward that are enemies to him in their minds by wicked works?,"Indeed, men one to another seem to be, some better, some worse, by nature, but to God they are all alike, dead in trespasses and sins.","20 We will, therefore, state it again--Are men saved by grace?","Then here you may see the reason why conversion runs at that rate among the sons of men, that none are converted for their good deeds, nor rejected for their bad, but even so many of both, and only so many, are brought home to God as grace is pleased to bring home to him.",1.,"None are received for their good deeds; for then they would not be saved by grace, but by works.","Works and grace, as I have showed, are in this matter opposite each to other; if he be saved by works, then not by grace; if by grace, then not by works (Rom 11).","That none are received of God for their good deeds is evident, not only because he declares his abhorrence of the supposition of such a thing, but hath also rejected the persons that have at any time attempted to present themselves to God in their own good deeds for justification.",This I have showed you before.,2.,Men are not rejected for their bad deeds.,"This is evident by Manasseh, by the murderers of our Lord Jesus Christ, by the men that you read of in the nineteenth of the Acts, with many others, whose sins were of as deep a dye as the sins of the worst of men (2 Chron 33:2,13; Acts 2:23,41; 19:19).","Grace respecteth, in the salvation of a sinner, chiefly the purpose of God; wherefore those that it findeth under that purpose, those it justifies freely, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.","At Saul's conversion, Ananias of Damascus brought in a most dreadful charge against him to the Lord Jesus Christ, saying, ""Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem; and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.""",But what said the Lord unto him?,"""Go thy way, for he is a chosen vessel unto me"" (Acts 9:13-15).","This man's cruelty and outrage must not hinder his conversion, because he was a chosen vessel.",Men's good deeds are no argument with God to convert them; men's bad deeds are no argument with him to reject them.,"I mean, those that come to Christ, by the drawings of the Father; besides, Christ also saith, ""I will in no wise cast"" such ""out.""",(John 6:37-44).,Second.,Is the salvation of the sinner by the grace of God?,"Then here you see the reason why some sinners, that were wonderfully averse to conversion by nature, are yet made to stoop to the God of their salvation.","Grace takes them to do, because grace hath designed them to this very thing.","Hence some of the Gentiles were taken from among the rest; God granted them repentance unto life, because he had taken them from among the rest, both by election and calling, for his name (Acts 11:18; 15:14).","These men that were not a people, are thus become the people of God; these men that were not beloved for their works, were yet beloved by the grace of God.","""I will call them my people which were not my people; and her beloved which was not beloved.""",But their minds are averse.,But are they the people on whom God doth magnify the riches of his grace?,"Why, then, they shall be, in the day of his power, made willing, and be able to believe through grace (Psa 110:3; Rom 9:25; Acts 18:27).",But doth the guilt and burden of sin so keep them down that they can by no means lift up themselves?,"Why, God will, by the exceeding greatness of that power by which he raised Christ from the dead, work in their souls also by the Spirit of grace, to cause them to believe and to walk in his ways (Eph 1:18-20).","Paul tells us, in that epistle of his to the Corinthians, that it was by grace he was what he was--""By the grace of God I am what I am,"" says he, ""and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain"" (1 Cor 15:10).","This man kept always in his mind a warm remembrance of what he was formerly by nature, and also how he had added to his vileness by practice; yea, moreover, he truly concluded in his own soul, that had not God, by unspeakable grace, put a stop to his wicked proceedings, he had perished in his wickedness; hence he lays his call and conversion at the door of the grace of God--""When it pleased God,"" says he, ""who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me"" (Gal 1:15,16).","and hence it is, again, that he saith, ""He obtained grace and apostleship""; grace to convert his soul, and the gifts and authority of an apostle, to preach the gospel of the grace of God.",This blessed man ascribes all to the grace of God.,1.,His call he ascribes to the grace of God.,2.,His apostleship he ascribes to the grace of God.,3.,And all his labour in that charge he also ascribes to the grace of God.,This grace of God it was that which saved from the beginning.,1.,"Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord, and was therefore converted and preserved from the flood (Gen 6:8).",2.,"Abraham found grace in the sight of the Lord, and therefore he was called out of his country (Gen 12:1,2).",3.,"Moses found grace in the eyes of the Lord, and therefore he must not be blotted out of God's book (Exo 33:12,17).","Neither may it be imagined that these men were, before grace laid hold on them, better than other men; for then they would not have been saved by grace; grace should not have had the dominion and glory of their salvation.","But, as Paul says of himself, and of those that were saved by grace in his day, ""What then?",are we better than they?,"No, in no wise; for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under sin"" (Rom 3:9).","So it may be said of these blessed ones; for indeed this conclusion is general, and reacheth all the children of men, Christ Jesus alone only excepted.","But, Third.",Is the salvation of the sinner by the grace of God?,"Then here you may see the reason why one backslider is recovered, and another left to perish in his backsliding.","There was grace for Lot, but none for his wife; therefore she was left in her transgression, but Lot was saved notwithstanding.","There was grace for Jacob, but none for Esau; therefore Esau was left in his backsliding, but Jacob found mercy notwithstanding.","There was grace for David, but none for Saul; therefore David obtained mercy, and Saul perished in his backsliding.","There was grace for Peter, but none for Judas; therefore Judas is left to perish in his backsliding, and Peter is saved from his sin.","That text stands good to none but those that are elect by grace--""Sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace"" (Rom 6:14).","It will be said, repentance was found in one, but not in the other.","Well, but who granted and gave the one repentance; The Lord turned, and looked upon Peter; he did not turn and look upon Judas; yea, the Lord told Peter before he fell that he should follow him to the kingdom of heaven, but told him that he should deny him first; but withal told him also he should not let his heart be troubled, that is, utterly dejected, for he would go and prepare a place for him, and come again and receive him to himself (John 13:36-38; 14:1-3).","That is a blessed word of God, ""The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he delighteth in his way.","Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand"" (Psa 37:23,24).",THE SECOND USE.,My second use shall be to them that are dejected in their souls at the sight and sense of their sins.,First.,"Are they that are saved, saved by grace?","Then they that would have their guilty consciences quieted, they must study the doctrine of grace.","It is Satan's great design either to keep the sinner senseless of his sins, or if God makes him sensible of them, then to hide and keep from his thoughts the sweet doctrine of the grace of God, by which alone the conscience getteth health and cure; ""for everlasting consolation, and good hope"" is given ""through grace"" (1 Thess 2:16).","How then shall the conscience of the burdened sinner by rightly quieted, if he perceiveth not the grace of God?","Study, therefore, this doctrine of the grace of God.","Suppose thou hast a disease upon thee which is not to be cured but by such or such medicines, the first step to thy cure is to know the medicines.","I am sure this is true as to the case in hand; the first step to the cure of a wounded conscience is for thee to know the grace of God, especially the grace of God as to justification from the curse in his sight.","A man under a wounded conscience naturally leaneth to the works of the law, and thinks God must be pacified by something that he should do, whereas the Word says, ""I will have mercy and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance"" (Matt 9:13).",Wherefore thou must study the grace of God.,"""It is a good thing,"" saith the apostle, ""that the heart be established with grace""; thereby insinuating that there is no establishment in the soul that is right but by the knowledge of the grace of God (Heb 13:9).","I said, that when a man is wounded in his conscience, he naturally leaneth to the works of the law; wherefore thou must therefore be so much the more heedful to study the grace of God; yea, so to study it as rightly, not only in notion, but in thy practices, to distinguish it from the law.","""The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ"" (John 1:17).","Study it, I say, so as to distinguish it, and that, not only from the law, but from all those things that men blasphemously call this grace of God.","There are many things which men call the grace of God, that are not.",1.,The light and knowledge that are in every man.,2.,That natural willingness that is in man to be saved.,3.,"That power that is in man by nature to do something, as he thinketh, towards his own salvation.",I name these three; there are also many other which some will have entitled the grace of God.,"But do thou remember that the grace of God is his goodwill and great love to sinners in his Son Jesus Christ; ""by the which"" good ""will we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all"" (Heb 10:10).","Again; when thou hast smelt out this grace of God, and canst distinguish it from that which is not, then labour to strengthen thy soul with the blessed knowledge of it.","""Thou therefore, my son,"" said Paul, ""be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus"" (2 Tim 2:1).","Fortify thy judgment and understanding; but especially labour to get down all into thy conscience, that that may be ""purged from dead works, to serve the living God.""",[Second.],"And to enforce this use upon thee yet further, consider, a man gets yet more advantage by the knowledge of, and by growing strong in, this grace of God.",1.,"It ministereth to him matter of joy; for he that knows this grace aright, he knows God is at peace with him, because he believeth in Jesus Christ, who by grace tasted death for every man; ""by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God"" (Rom 5:2).",And indeed what joy or what rejoicing is like rejoicing here?,"To rejoice in hope of the glory of God, it is to rejoice in hope to enjoy him for ever, with that eternal glory that is in him.",2.,"As it manifesteth matter of joy and rejoicing, so it causeth much fruitfulness in all holiness and godliness.","""For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world"" (Titus 2:11,12).","Yea, it so naturally tendeth this way, that it can no sooner appear to the soul, but it causeth this blessed fruit in the heart and life.","""We ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.","But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour appeared""--what then?","Why then, he that believeth, being justified by his grace, and expecting to be an heir according to the hope of eternal life, is ""careful to maintain good works"" (Titus 3:3-8).","See also that in Paul's epistle to the Colossians--""We give thanks,"" says he, ""to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints, for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;

that thing included, though not expressed in the words, is called in another place, the Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, the general assembly and church of the first-born which are written in heaven.","(Heb 12:23) And therefore the words signify unto us, that there is a state most glorious, and that when this world is ended; and that this place and state are likewise to be enjoyed, and inherited by a generation of men for ever.","Besides, this word, ""enter in,"" signifieth that salvation to the full is to be enjoyed only there, and that there only is eternal safety; all other places and conditions are hazardous, dangerous, full of snares, imperfections, temptations, and afflictions, but there all is well; there is no devil to tempt, no desperately wicked heart to deliver us up, no deceitful lust to entangle, nor any enchanting world to bewitch us.",There all shall be well to all eternity.,"Further, all the parts of, and circumstances that attend salvation, are only there to be enjoyed; there only is immortality and eternal life; there is the glory and fulness of joy, and the everlasting pleasures; there is God and Christ to be enjoyed by open vision, and more; there are the angels and the saints; further, there is no death, nor sickness, no sorrow nor sighing for ever; there is no pain, nor persecutor, nor darkness, to eclipse our glory.",O this Mount Zion!,O this heavenly Jerusalem!,"(2 Cor 5:1-4, Psa 16:11, Luke 20:35,36, Heb 12:22-24) Behold, therefore, what a great thing the Lord Jesus hath included by this little word, ""IN.""","In this word is wrapt up a whole heaven and eternal life; even as there is also by other little words in the holy Scriptures of truth: as where he saith, ""Knock, and it shall be opened unto you,"" and ""the election hath obtained it.""","This should teach us, not only to read, but to attend in reading; not only to read, but to lift up our hearts to God in reading; for if we be not heedful, if he gives us not light and understanding, we may easily pass over, without any great regard, such a word as may have a glorious kingdom and eternal salvation in the bowels of it; yea, sometimes, as here, a whole heaven is intimated, where it is not at all expressed.","The apostles of old did use to fetch great things out of the Scriptures, even out of the very order and timing of the several things contained therein.","See Romans 4:9-11, Galatians 3:16,17, Hebrews 8:13.","But, [DESCRIPTION OF THE ENTRANCE INTO THIS KINGDOM.]",Second.,"As we have here an intimation of the kingdom of heaven, so we have a description of the entrance into it, and that by a double similitude: I.",It is called a gate; II.,"A strait gate--""Strive to enter in at the strait gate.""",[It is called a gate.],I.,It is set forth by the similitude of a gate.,"A gate, you know, is of a double use.","It is to open and shut, and so, consequently, to let in or to keep out; and to do both these at the season; as he said, ""Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot""; and again, ""I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the Sabbath.""","(Neh 7:3, 13:19,20) And so you find of this gate of heaven, when the five wise virgins came, the gate was opened; but afterwards came the other virgins, and the door was shut.","(Matt 25) So then, the entrance into heaven is called a gate, to show there is a time when there may be entrance, and there will come a time when there shall be none; and, indeed, this is a chief truth contained in the text--""Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.""","I read in the Scriptures of two gates or doors, through which they that go to heaven must enter.",2 1.,"There is the door of faith, the door which the grace of God hath opened to the Gentiles.","This door is Jesus Christ, as also himself doth testify, saying, ""I am the door,"" &c. (John 10:9, Acts 14:27) By this door men enter into God's favour and mercy, and find forgiveness through faith in his blood, and live in hope of eternal life; and therefore himself also hath said, ""I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved""; that is, received to mercy, and inherit eternal life.","But, 2.","There is another door or gate--for that which is called in the text a gate, is twice in the next verse called a door--there is, I say, another gate, and that is the passage into the very heaven itself; the entrance into the celestial mansion-house, and that is the gate mentioned in the text, 3 and the door mentioned twice in the verse that follows.","And this Jacob called it, when he said, Bethel was the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven; that is, the entrance, for he saw the entrance into heaven.","One end of Jacob's ladder stands in Bethel, God's house, and the other end reacheth up to the gate of heaven.","(Gen 28:10-17) Jacob's ladder was the figure of Christ, which ladder was not the gate of heaven, but the way from the church to that gate which he saw above at the top of the ladder.","(Gen 28:12, John 1:51) But again, that the gate in the text is the gate or entrance into heaven, consider-- (1.)","It is that gate that letteth men into, or shutteth men out of that place or kingdom where Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob is, which place is that paradise where Christ promised the thief that he should be that day, that he asked to be with him in his kingdom; it is that place into which Paul said he was caught, when he heard words unlawful or impossible for a man to utter.","(Luke 13:28, 23:42, 2 Cor 12:1-6) Quest.",But is not Christ the gate or entrance into this heavenly place?,Answ.,"He is he without whom no man can get thither, because by his merits men obtain that world, and also because he, as the Father, is the donor and disposer of that kingdom to whom he will.","Further, this place is called his house, and himself the Master of it--""When once the Master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door.""","(Luke 13:25) But we use to say, that the master of the house is not the door.","Men enter into heaven, then, by him, not as he is the gate, or door, or entrance, into the celestial mansion-house, but as he is the giver and disposer of that kingdom to them whom he shall count worthy, because he hath obtained it for them.",(2.),"That this gate is the very passage into heaven, consider the text hath special reference to the day of judgment, when Christ will have laid aside his mediatory office, which before he exercised for the bringing to the faith his own elect; and will then act, not as one that justifieth the ungodly, but as one that judgeth sinners.","He will now be risen up from the throne of grace, and shut up the door against all the impenitent, and will be set upon the throne of judgment, from thence to proceed with ungodly sinners.",Object.,"But Christ bids strive: ""Strive"" now ""to enter in at the strait gate""; but if that gate be as you say, the gate or entrance into heaven, then it should seem that we should not strive till the day of judgment, for we shall not come at that gate till then.",Answ.,"Christ, by this exhortation, Strive, &c., doth not at all admit of, or countenance delays, or that a man should neglect his own salvation; but putteth poor creatures upon preparing for the judgment, and counselleth them now to get those things that will then give them entrance into glory.","This exhortation is much like these: ""Therefore be ye also ready, for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.--And they that were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.""","(Matt 24:44, 25:10) So that when he saith, ""Strive to enter in,"" it is as if he should say, Blessed are they that shall be admitted another day to enter into the kingdom of heaven; but they that shall be counted worthy of so unspeakable a favour, must be well prepared and fitted for it beforehand.","Now, the time to be fitted is not the day of judgment, but the day of grace; not then, but now.","Therefore, strive now for those things that will then give you entrance into the heavenly kingdom.","But, [It is called a strait gate.]",II.,"As it is called a gate, so it is called a strait gate--""Strive to enter in at the strait gate.""","The straitness of this gate is not to be understood carnally, but mystically.","You are not to understand it, as if the entrance into heaven was some little pinching wicket; no, the straitness of this gate is quite another thing.","This gate is wide enough for all them that are the truly gracious and sincere lovers of Jesus Christ, but so strait, as that not one of the other can by any means enter in: ""Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord: this gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter.""","(Psa 118:19,20) By this word, therefore, Christ Jesus hath showed unto us, that without due qualifications there is no possibility of entering into heaven; the strait gate will keep all others out.","When Christ spake this parable, he had doubtless his eye upon some passage or passages of the Old Testament, with which the Jews were well acquainted.","I will mention two, and so go on.",1.,The place by which God turned Adam and his wife out of paradise.,"Possibly our Lord might have his eye upon that; for though that was wide enough for them to come out at, yet it was too strait for them to go in at.",But what should be the reason of that?,"Why, they had sinned; and therefore God ""placed at the east of that garden cherubims, and a flaming sword, which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.""","(Gen 3:24) The cherubims, and the flaming sword, they made the entrance too strait for them to enter in.","Souls, there are cherubims and a flaming sword at the gates of heaven to keep the way of the tree of life; therefore none but them that are duly fitted for heaven can enter in at this strait gate; the flaming sword will keep all others out.","""Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?","Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.""","(1 Cor 6:9,10) (2.)","Perhaps our Lord might have his eye upon the gates of the temple when he spoke this word unto the people; for though the gates of the temple were six cubits wide, yet they were so strait, that none that were unclean in anything might enter in thereat (Eze 40:48), because there were placed at these gates, porters, whose office was to look that none but those that had right to enter might go in thither.","And so it is written, Jehoiada set ""porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that none which was unclean in anything should enter in.""","(2 Chron 23:19) Souls, God hath porters at the gates of the temple, at the gate of heaven; porters, I say, placed there by God, to look that none that are unclean in anything may come in thither.","In at the gate of the church, none may enter now that are openly profane, and scandalous to religion; no, though they plead they are beloved of God: ""What hath my beloved to do in mine house,"" saith the Lord, ""seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many?""","(Jer 11:15) I say, I am very apt to believe that our Lord Jesus Christ had his thoughts upon these two texts, when he said the gate is strait: and that which confirms me the more in the things is this, a little below the text he saith, ""There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of heaven, and you yourselves thrust out.""","(Luke 13:28) Thrust out, which signifieth a violent act, resisting with striving those that would--though unqualified--enter.","The porters of the temple were, for this very thing, to wear arms, if need were, and to be men of courage and strength, lest the unsanctified or unprepared should by some means enter in.","We read, in the book of Revelations, of the holy city, and that it had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; but what did they do there?","Why, amongst the rest of their service, this was one thing, that there might ""in no wise enter in to it any thing that defileth, or worketh abomination, or that maketh a lie.""",(Rev 21:27) [Three things that make this gate so strait.],"But more particularly, to show what it is that maketh this gate so strait.",There are three things that make it strait--1.,There is sin.,2.,There is the word of the law.,3.,There are the angels of God.,1.,"There is sin; the sin of the profane, and the sin of the professor.",(1.),The sin of the profane.,"But this needs not be enlarged upon, because it is concluded upon at all hands, where there is the common belief of the being of God, and the judgment to come, that ""the wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.""",(Psa 9:17) (2.),"But there is the sin of professors; or take it rather thus, there is a profession that will stand with an unsanctified heart and life.","The sin of such will overpoise the salvation of their souls, the sin end being the heaviest end of the scale; I say, that being the heaviest end which hath sin in it, they tilt over, and so are, notwithstanding their glorious profession, drowned in perdition and destruction; for none such hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God; therefore ""let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience""; neither will a profession be able to excuse them.",(Eph 5:3-6) The gate will be too strait for such as these to enter in thereat.,"A man may partake of salvation in part, but not of salvation in whole.","God saved the children of Israel out of Egypt, but overthrew them in the wilderness:--""I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.""","(Jude 5) So we see that, notwithstanding their beginning, ""they could not enter in, because of unbelief.""",(Heb 3:19) 2.,"There is the word of the law, and that will make the gate strait also.","None must go in thereat but those that can go in by the leave of the law; for though no man be, or can be, justified by the works of the law, yet unless the righteousness and holiness by which they attempt to enter into this kingdom be justified by the law, it is in vain once to think of entering in at this strait gate.","Now the law justifieth not, but upon the account of Christ's righteousness; if therefore thou be not indeed found in that righteousness, thou wilt find the law lie just in the passage into heaven to keep thee out.","Every man's work must be tried by fire, that it may be manifest of what sort it is.","There are two errors in the world about the law; one is, when men think to enter in at the strait gate by the righteousness of the law; the other is, when men think they may enter into heaven without the leave of the law.","Both these, I say, are errors; for as by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified; so without the consent of the law, no flesh shall be saved.","""Heaven and earth shall pass away, before one jot or tittle of the law shall fail, till all be fulfilled.""",He therefore must be damned that cannot be saved by the consent of the law.,"And, indeed, this law is the flaming sword that turneth every way;

and the rather, because of the unaptness of the minds, even of the saints themselves, to retain it without commixture.","For, to say nothing of the projects of hell, and of the cunning craftiness of some that lie in wait to deceive even the godly themselves, as they are dull of hearing, so much more dull in receiving and holding fast the simplicity of the gospel of Jesus Christ.","From their sense, and reason, and unbelief, and darkness, arise many imaginations and high thoughts, which exalt themselves against the knowledge of God and the obedience of Jesus Christ, wherefore they themselves have much ado to stand complete in all the will of God.","And were they not concerned in electing love, by which they are bound up in the bundle of life, and blessed with the enjoyment of saving grace, which enlighteneth their souls and maintaineth their fath and hope, they would not only be assaulted and afflicted with their own corruptions, but, as others, overcome thereby.",Alas!,"how ordinary a thing is it for professors to fall from the knowledge they have had of the glorious gospel of the blessed God, and to be turned unto fables, seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils, through the intoxications of delusions and the witchcraft of false preachers.","Now, this their swerving from the gospel ariseth, 1.","Either from their not having, or, having, not retaining, the true knowledge of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ;

and if they know not the reason of his coming, doing, and suffering, they are in the same condition also.","Now, those professors that have had some knowledge of these things, and yet have lost them, it hath come thus to pass with them because they first lost the knowledge of themselves and of their sins.","They know not themselves to be such nothing ones as the Scriptures reporteth them to be, nor their sins to be so heinous as the law hath concluded; therefore they either turn again with the dog to his vomit, or adhere to a few of the rags of their own fleshly righteousness, and so become pure in their own eyes, yet are not purged by blood from their filthiness.","For the person and doings of Jesus Christ are only precious to them that get and retain the true knowledge of themselves, and the due reward of their sins by the law.","These are desolate, being driven out of all; these embrace the rock instead of a shelter.",The sensible sinner receiveth him joyfully.,"And because a miscarriage in this great truth is the most dangerous and damning miscarriage, therefore should professors be the more fearful of swerving aside therefrom.","The man that rejecteth the true knowledge of the person of the Lord Jesus, and the causes of his doing and suffering in the world, takes the next way to be guilty of that transgression that is not to be purged with sacrifice for ever; that fearful transgression for which is left no offering at all, nor anything to be expected by the person transgressing but fearful judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversary.","Now, for their sakes that have not sinned this sin, for their sakes that are in danger thereof, but yet not overcome, for their sakes have I written this little book, wherein is largely, and yet with few words, discovered the doctrine of the person, and doings, and sufferings of Christ, with the true cause thereof, also a removal of those objections that the crafty children of darkness have framed against the same.","And I have been the more plain and simple in my writing, because the sin against the Holy Ghost is in these days more common than formerly, and the way unto it more beautified with colour and pretence of truth.","I may say of the way to this sin, it is, as was once the way to Jerusalem, strewed with boughs and branches;

by which having prepared their minds to attend, he proceeds and gives a particular relation of God's peculiar dealings with his people Israel, from Egypt to the time of David their king, of whom he treateth particularly-- That he was the son of Jesse, that he was a king, that God raised him up in mercy, that God gave testimony of him, that he was a man after God's own heart, that he should fulfil all his will (v 22).","And this he did of purpose both to engage them the more to attend, and because they well knew that of the fruit of his loins God hath promised the Messiah should come.","Having thus therefore gathered up their minds to hearken, he presenteth them with his errand--to wit, that the Messiah was come, and that the promise was indeed fulfilled that a Saviour should be born to Israel--'Of this man's seed,' saith he, 'hath God, according to his promise, raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus.'",In this assertion he concludeth--1.,"That the promise had kept its due course in presenting a Saviour to Israel--to wit, in David's loins--'Of this man's seed.'",2.,"That the time of the promise was come, and the Saviour was revealed--'God hath raised unto Israel a Saviour.'",3.,"That Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph, was he--'He hath raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus.'","From these things we may inquire, for the explication of the words, First.",What this Jesus is?,Second.,What it was for this Jesus to be of the seed of David?,Third.,What it was for Jesus to be of this man's seed according to the promise?,"And, Fourth, what it was for him to be raised unto Israel?",These things may give us light into what shall be spoken after.,Quest.,First.,What this Jesus is?,"He is God, and had personal being from before all worlds; therefore not such an one as took being when he was formed in the world; he is God's natural Son, the Eternal Son of his begetting and love--'God sent forth his Son.'","He was, and was his Son, before he was revealed--'What is his name, and what is his Son's name, if thou canst tell?'",(Prov 30:4; Eze 21:10).,"He hath an eternal generation, such as none can declare, not man, not angel (Isa 53:8).",He was the delight of his Father before he had made either mountain or hill.,"While as yet he had not made the earth or the fields, or the highest part of the dust of the world, all things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made, and he is before all things, and by him all things consist.","It is he with whom the Father consulted when he was about to make man, when he intended to overthrow Babel, and when he sent Isaiah to harden the hearts of Israel (Prov 8:26; John 1:3; Heb 1:2,3; Col 1:17; Gen 1:26, 11:7; Isa 6:8).",This is the person intended in the text.,Hence also he testifies of himself that he came down from the Father; that he had glory with him before the world was.,And 'what and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?',"(John 6:62, 16:28, 17:5).",Quest.,Second.,What was it for Jesus to be of David's seed?,"To be of David's seed is to spring from his loins, to come of his race according to the flesh; and therefore as he is David's God, so likewise is he David's Son; the root and also the offspring of David.","And this the Lord himself acknowledgeth, saying, 'I am the root,' or God, 'and the offspring,' and Son, 'of David, and the bright and morning star' (Rev 22:16).","This is indeed the great mystery, the mystery of godliness.","'If David then call him Lord, how is he his Son?'",(Matt 22:45; Luke 2:4; Rom 1:3; 2 Tim 2:8).,"And hence it is that he is said to be 'wonderful,' because he is both God and man in one person--'Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful' (Isa 9:6).",Wonderful indeed!,"Wonderful God, Wonderful man, Wonderful God-man, and so a Wonderful Jesus and Saviour.","He also hath wonderful love, bore wonderful sorrows for our wonderful sins, and obtained for HIS a wonderful salvation.",Quest.,Third.,What was it for Jesus to be of this man's seed according to the promise?,"This word 'promise' doth sometimes comprehend all the promises which God made to our fathers, from the first promise to the last, and so the Holy Ghost doth call them--'The promise made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children' (Acts 13:32,33).","But the word 'promise' here doth in special intend that which God made to David himself--'Men and brethren,' said Peter, 'let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.","Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ,' &c. (Acts 2:29,30).",Quest.,Fourth.,What was it for Jesus to be raised thus up of God to Israel?,Here we have two things to consider of--1. Who Israel is.,2.,What it was for Jesus to be raised up unto them.,1. Who Israel is.,"By 'Israel' sometimes we should understand the whole stock of Jacob, the natural children of his flesh; for that name they have of him, for he obtained it when he wrestled with the angel, and prevailed, and it remained with his seed in their generations (Gen 32).","By 'Israel' we are to understand all those that God hath promised to Christ--'The children of the promise are counted for the seed,' the elect Jews and Gentiles.","These are called 'the Israel of God,' and the seed of Abraham, whom Jesus in special regarded in his undertaking the work of man's redemption (Rom 9:8; Gal 6:16; Heb 2:14-16).",2.,What it was for Jesus to be raised up unto them.,This word 'raised up' is diversely taken in the Scripture.,(1.),"It is taken for 'sending'; as when he saith he raised them up judges, saviours, and prophets, he means he sent them such, and thus he raised up Jesus--that is, 'he sent him' (Judg 2:16,18, 3:9,15; Amos 2:11).","'I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment' (John 12:49).",(2.),"To be raised up, intimateth one invested with power and authority.","Thus he raised up David to be the king of Israel, he anointed him and invested him with kingly power (1 Sam 16:13; Acts 13:22).",And thus was Jesus Christ raised up.,Hence he is called 'the horn of salvation'--'He hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David' (Luke 1:69).,(3.),"To be raised up, intimateth quickening and strengthening, to oppose and overcome all opposition.","Thus was Jesus raised up from under sin, death, the rage of the world, and hell, that day that God raised him out of the grave.","Thus, therefore, was Jesus raised up to Israel--that is, he was sent, authorized, and strengthened to, and in the work of, their salvation, to the completing of it.",The words thus opened do lay before us these two observations--FIRST.,"That in all ages God gave his people a promise, and so ground for a believing remembrance, that he would one day send them a Saviour.",SECOND.,"That when Jesus was come into the world, then was that promise of God fulfilled.",[OBSERVATION FIRST.],"To begin with the first, THAT IN ALL AGES GOD GAVE HIS PEOPLE A PROMISE, AND SO GROUND FOR A BELIEVING REMEMBRANCE, THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY SEND THEM A SAVIOUR.","This Zacharias testifies when he was filled with the Holy Ghost; for, speaking of the Messiah or the Saviour, he saith that God spake of him by the mouth of all the prophets which have been since the world began; to which I will add that of Peter, 'Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days' (Luke 1:69,70; Acts 3:24).","From these texts it is evident that in every generation or age of the world God did give his people a promise, and so ground for a believing remembrance, that he would one day send them a Saviour; for indeed the promise is not only a ground for a remembrance, but for a believing remembrance.","What God saith is sufficient ground for faith, because he is truth, and cannot lie or repent.","But that is not all; his heart was engaged, yea, all his heart, in the promise which he spoke of sending us a Saviour.",From this observation I shall make inquiry into these three things--FIRST.,What it is to be a Saviour.,SECOND.,How it appears that God in all ages gave his people a promise that he would one day send them a Saviour.,THIRD.,That this was ground for believing remembrance that a Saviour should one day come.,FIRST.,What it is to be a Saviour.,First.,"This word 'Saviour' is easy to be understood, it being all one with Deliverer, Redeemer, &c. 'A Saviour, Jesus,' both words are of the same signification, and are doubled, perhaps to teach us that the person mentioned in the text is not called 'Jesus' only to distinguish him from other men--for names are given to distinguish--but also and especially to specify his office; his name is Saviour, because it was to be his work, his office, his business in the world.","His name shall be called Jesus, 'for he shall save his people from their sins' (Matt 1:21).",Second.,This word 'Saviour' is a word so large that it hath place in all the undertakings of Christ: for whatever he doth in his mediation he doth as a Saviour.,"He interposeth between God and man as a Saviour; he engageth against sin, the devil, death, and hell, as a Saviour, and triumphed over them by himself as a Saviour.",Third.,"The word 'Saviour,' as I said, is all one with Redeemer, Deliverer, Reconciler, Peace-maker, or the like; for though there be variation in the terms, yet Saviour is the intendment of them all.","By redeeming he becomes a Saviour, by delivering he becomes a Saviour, by reconciling he becomes a Saviour, and by making peace he becometh a Saviour.","But I pass this now, intending to speak more to the same question afterwards.",SECOND.,How it appears that God in all ages gave his people a promise that he would one day send them a Saviour.,"It appears evidently; for so soon as man had sinned, God came to him with a heart full of promise, and continued to renew, and renew, till the time of the promised Messiah to be revealed was come.",[First.],"He promised him under the name of 'the seed of the women,' after our first father had sinned--'I will also put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed.","He shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel' (Gen 3:15).","[1] This the apostle hath his eye upon when he saith, 'When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law' (Gal 4:4,5).",Second.,"God renewed this promise to Abraham, and there tells him Christ should be his seed, saying, 'In thy seed shall all families of the earth be blessed' (Gen 12:3).","'Now,' saith Paul, 'to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.","He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ' (Gal 3:16).",Third.,"He was promised in the time of Moses under the name of a 'prophet'--'I will raise them up,' saith God to him, 'a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee' (Deut 18:18).","This Peter expounds of Christ, 'For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you' (Acts 3:22).",Fourth.,"He promised him to David under the title of a 'son,' saying, 'I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son' (2 Sam 7:14).","For this the apostle expounded of the Saviour, saying, 'Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee'; and again, 'I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son' (Heb 1:5).",Fifth.,"He was promised in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah-- 1.",By the name of a 'branch'--'In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious' (Isa 4:2).,2.,"Under the name of the 'son of a virgin'--'Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.'",This Matthew expounds of Christ (Isa 7:14; Matt 1:23).,3.,"He was promised under the name of a 'rod'--'There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots, and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him.'","This answereth the text, David was the son of Jesse, and Christ the Son of David (Isa 11:1,2).",4.,"He is promised under the title of a 'king'--'Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness,--and a man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land' (Isa 32:1,2).",5.,"He was promised under the name of an 'elect servant'--'Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.","He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.","A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench' (Isa 42:1-3; Matt 12:17-20).",6.,"He was promised to Jeremiah under the name of 'the Lord our Righteousness'--'Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper; and shall execute judgment--in the earth.","In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS' (Jer 23:5,6).",7.,"He was promised by the prophet Ezekiel under the name of 'David, a shepherd'--'And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.","And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the Lord have spoken it' (Eze 24:23; John 10:1-3).",8.,"He was promised by the prophet Daniel under the name of 'Messiah, or Christ, the most holy'--'And after threescore and two weeks shall the Messiah be cut off, but not for himself' (Dan 9:26).",9.,"He was promised by the prophet Micah under the name of the 'ruler in Israel'--'But thou, Bethlehem-Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come--that is to be ruler in Israel' (Micah 5:2; Matt 2:6).",10.,"He was promised to Haggai as 'the desire of all nations'--'I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts' (Hagg 2:7).",11.,"He was promised by Zechariah under the name of 'servant and branch'--'For, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.'","And again, 'Behold the man whose name is the BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory' (Zech 3:8, 6:12,13).",12.,"He was promised by Malachi under the name of 'the Lord, and the messenger of the covenant'--'Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts' (Mal 3:1).","Indeed, the Scriptures of the Old Testament are filled with promises of the Messias to come, prophetical promises, typical promises; for all the types and shadows of the Saviour are virtually so many promises.",Sixth.,"Having therefore touched upon the prophetical, I will briefly touch the typical promises also; for as God spake at sundry times to the fathers, so also in diverse manners, prophetically, providentially, typically, and all of the Messias (Heb 1:1).",The types of the Saviour were various--1.,Sometimes he was typed out by men; 2.,Sometimes by beasts; 3.,Sometimes by insensible creatures.,1.,He was typed forth sometimes by men.,"Adam was his type in many things, especially as he was the head and father of the first world.",He was 'the figure of him that was to come' (Rom 5:14).,"Moses was his type as Mediator, and as builder of the tabernacle (Heb 3:2,3).","Aaron was his type as he was high-priest, and so was Melchisedec before him (Heb 5:4,5, 7:1,21).","Samson was his type in the effects of his death; for as Samson gave his life for the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines, Christ gave his life to deliver us from sin and devils.","Joshua was his type in giving the land of Canaan to Israel, as Jesus will give the kingdom of heaven to the elect (Heb 4:8).","David was his type in many things, especially in his subduing of Israel's enemies, and feeding them [Israel]: hence he is sometimes called David their king, and David their shepherd (Eze 34:23,24).","Solomon was his type in his building the temple, and in his peaceable kingdom.","Hence it is said, 'He shall build the temple of the Lord'; and again, 'Of his government and peace there shall be no end.'",2.,Beasts were his types.,To instance some-- (1.),The paschal lamb was his type (Exo 12).,"In its spotlessness; Christ was 'a lamb without blemish and without spot' (1 Peter 1:18,19).",In its being roasted it was a figure of the cursed death of Christ; for to be roasted bespake one accursed (Jer 29:22; Gal 3:13).,"In that it was to be eaten--'Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood,' saith Christ, 'hath eternal life' (John 6:54).","In that its blood was to be sprinkled upon the doors of their houses, for the destroying angel to look on; the blood of Christ is sprinkled upon the elect for the justice of God to look on (Heb 9; 1 Peter 1:2).","By eating the paschal lamb, the people went out of Egypt; by feeding upon Christ by faith we come from under the Egyptian darkness, tyranny of Satan, &c.",(2.),"The red cow was his type (Num 19:2, &c.).",[2] In that she was to be without blemish.,"In that she was to be slain without the camp--'Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate' (Heb 13:12).",In that her flesh was to be burnt; a type of the grievous death of Christ.,Her ashes were to be carried into a clean place without the camp; a type of the clean sepulchre where the body of Jesus was laid (John 19:38-41).,"There were also divers other sacrifices, as bulls, goats, and birds, which were types of him, which I here omit.",3.,Insensible creatures were his types.,"As, (1.)",The man in the wilderness (Exo 16).,"And that as it came down from heaven, for so did Christ--'I came down from heaven,' saith he; and again, 'I am the living bread which came down from heaven' (John 6:51).","The manna was to be eaten; so is Christ by faith--'If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world' (John 6:51).",The manna was to be gathered daily; so is Christ to be daily eaten.,The manna was all the bread that Israel had in the wilderness; Christ is all the bread that believers have in this life for their souls.,"The manna came not by Moses' law, neither comes Christ by our merits--'Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven' (John 6:32).",(2.),Again; the rock that gave them out water for their thirst was a type of him (Num 20).,"They 'did all drink the same spiritual drink, for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them; and that Rock was Christ' (1 Cor 10:4).",This rock was his type in four things-- (a.),It gave drink to the people in the wilderness when they were come out of Egypt; Christ gives drink to them that forsake the world for him.,(b.),"The rock yielded water by being smitten by Moses' rod; Christ giveth drink, even his blood, by being stricken by Moses' law (Num 20:11; Isa 53).","(c.) The water out of this rock was given to the thirsty--'I will give unto him that is athirst,' saith Christ, 'of the fountain of the water of life freely' (Rev 21:6).","(d.) The water of the rock in the wilderness ran after the people; they drank of that rock that followed them--'He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out, they ran in the dry places like a river' (Psa 110:41).",Christ also is said by that type to follow us--'They drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them; and that Rock was Christ' (1 Cor 10:4).,(3.),"Again, the mount Moriah was his type.",That mount stood in Jerusalem; Christ also stands in his church.,"Upon that rock was built the temple (2 Chron 3:1)--'And upon this rock,' said Christ, 'I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it' (Matt 16:18).","Other things might be urged, but these being virtually of the force of the promises, and also as a key to open them, therefore I thought good to place them here with the promises; because, as they are standing with them, so they are written to beget faith in the same Lord Jesus Christ.",THIRD.,"I come now to the third thing--to wit, That these promises were ground for a believing remembrance that a Saviour should one day come.","There is a remembering, and a believing remembering, or such a remembering that begetteth and maintaineth faith in the heart.","Jacob had a believing remembrance when he said, 'I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord' (Gen 49:18).","And so had David when he cried, 'O that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion' (Psa 53:6).","These, with Simeon and Anna, had not a remembrance only, but a believing remembrance that God would send them a Saviour.","They had the promise not in the book only, but in their hearts; this gospel was mixed in them with faith; therefore they with their fellows remembered and believed, or made the promise the ground of their believing that God would one day send them a Saviour.",Let me make some Use of this Doctrine.,"Here we may see how much the heart of God was set upon the salvation of sinners--he studied it, contrived it, set his heart on it, and promised, and promised, and promised to complete it, by sending one day his Son for a Saviour (2 Same 14:14; Eph 1:3; Titus 1:2).","No marvel, therefore, if when he treateth of the new covenant, in which the Lord Jesus is wrapped, and presented in a word of promise to the world, that he saith, I will do it 'assuredly with my whole heart, and with my whole soul' (Jer 32:41).","Now this is of singular comfort to sensible sinners; yea, what greater ground of consolation to such than to hear that the God against whom they have sinned should himself take care to provide them a Saviour.","There are some poor sinners in the world that have given such way to discouragement, from the sense of the greatness of their sins, that they dare not think upon God, nor the sins which they have committed; but the reason is, because they are ignorant that God's heart was wrapt up in this good work of providing and sending a Saviour.","Let such hearken now to the call of God--'Return unto me, for I have redeemed thee' (Isa 44:22).",Ho!,"turn again, hearken; the heart of God is much set upon mercy; from the beginning of the world he resolved and promised, aye, and sware we should have a Saviour.",[OBSERVATION SECOND.],"I now proceed to the second observation--THAT WHEN JESUS WAS COME INTO THE WORLD, THEN WAS THE PROMISE OF GOD FULFILLED--namely, THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY SEND US A SAVIOUR.",Take three texts for the confirmation of this point--1.,'This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world' (John 6:14).,"These words were spoken of them that were present at that miracle of Jesus, when he fed five thousand with five barley loaves, which a lad had about him in the company; for these men, when they had seen the marvel, being amazed at it, made confession of him to be the Saviour.",2.,"'Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world' (John 11:27).",3.,"'This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners' (1 Tim 1:15).",For the explaining of this observation I will briefly handle three questions--FIRST.,How this Jesus is to be distinguished from others of that name.,SECOND.,What it was for this Jesus to come into the world.,THIRD.,What it was for him to come to be a Saviour.,[HOW THIS JESUS IS TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHERS.],QUEST.,FIRST.,"For the first, the Jesus in the text is distinguished from all others of that name.",First.,"By the manner of his birth; he was born of a virgin, a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph; but he 'knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son, and he called his name JESUS' (Matt 1:25).",Second.,"He is distinguished from others of that name by the place of his birth--to wit, Bethlehem, the city of David; there he must be born, there he was born (John 7:42; Matt 2:4-6).",Third.,He is distinguished by his lineage--he came 'of the house and lineage of David' (Luke 2:4-6).,Fourth.,"He is distinguished by the time of his birth--to wit, the time of the prophets prefixed (Gal 4:4).",Fifth.,But his common distinction is Jesus of Nazareth; by this name he is distinguished one and twenty times in the New Testament--1.,His enemies called him 'Jesus of Nazareth' (Matt 26:71; Mark 14:67; John 18:5).,2.,His disciples called him 'Jesus of Nazareth' (Matt 21:11; Luke 24:19; John 1:45; Acts 2:22).,3.,The angels called him 'Jesus of Nazareth' (Mark 16:6).,4.,And he calleth himself 'Jesus of Nazareth' (Acts 22:8).,5.,"Yea, and he goeth also by the name of 'Jesus of Nazareth' among the devils (Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34).",He was called 'Jesus of Nazareth' because he dwelt there with his mother Mary and her husband.,"Nazareth was his city, where he had been brought up, whither for shelter Joseph carried him when he came out of Egypt with him; in Nazareth was his common abode until the time that John was cast into prison; wherefore he might well say, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth' (Luke 4:16; Matt 2:23, 4:12,13).","Yea, though he was now in heaven, for heaven shall not make us forget what countrymen we were when we lived in the world.","Jesus, you see here, though glorified in heaven, yet forgets not what countryman he was when he dwelt in the world.","'I am Jesus of Nazareth,' saith he; I am the Jesus that thou persecutest; and that thou mayest know I am he, I tell thee I dwelt once in the city of Nazareth in Galilee; Joseph and my mother Mary brought me up there, and there I dwelt with them many years.","'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest' (Acts 22:8).",[WHAT IT WAS FOR JESUS TO COME INTO THE WORLD.],QUEST.,SECOND.,What it was for Jesus to come into the world.,Answ.,"Not his coming in, or by his Spirit in his people; for so he was never out of the world.",Neither is it his appearance in his ordinances.,Nor that coming of his by which he destroyeth Antichrist.,Nor his appearing in his dreadful providences or judgments.,"But by the coming of Jesus, according to the text, we are to understand that, or such a coming, whereby he was manifest to be God-man in one person; God in our flesh without us, or distinct in his own person by himself; such a coming by which he was manifested to be in all points like as men are, sin only excepted; such a coming wherein, or by which, the Son of God became also the Son of man.",[First.],"For the further clearing of this, you find it expressly said, he was 'born into the world'; Mary, 'of whom was born Jesus.'","Now, when Jesus was born, it is said, 'Where is he that is born King of the Jews?'","Herod 'demanded of them where Christ should be born' (Matt 1:16, 2:1,2,4; Luke 1:35, 2:11).","Now, that this was fulfilled according to the very word of the text, without any juggle, evasion, or cunningly-devised fable, consider-- 1.","He is called the first-born of this woman; the male child that opened her womb (Luke 2:7,23).",2.,"He was not born till nourished in her womb the full time, according to the time of life: 'And so it was, that while they were there [at Bethlehem], the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.","And she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him in swaddling-clothes, and laid him in a manger' (Luke 2:6,7).",3.,"She also continued in her separation at the birth of Jesus, as other women at the birth of their children, until 'the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished' (Luke 2:22).",4.,"Himself also, as other Hebrew children, was brought to Jerusalem to present him unto the Lord--'As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord' (Luke 2:23,24).",5.,"Thus Jesus also, as other Hebrew children, when the set day was come, was circumcised--'And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb' (Luke 2:21).",6.,"After this he is often called the young child, the child Jesus; and further, it is said of him, that he grew, that he increased in wisdom and stature (Matt 2:20,21; Luke 2:40,52).","Behold with what diligence, even to a circumstance, the Holy Ghost sets forth the birth of the Lord Jesus, and all to convince the incredulous world of the true manner of the coming of the Saviour into the world.",Second.,"The reality of the manhood of this Lord Jesus is yet further manifest, and that, 1.",By those natural infirmities that attend human flesh; 2.,By the names the prophets gave him in the days of the Old Testament and the New.,1.,By those natural infirmities that attend human flesh.,"As, at his birth he could not go but as carried by his parents.",He was sensible of hunger (Luke 4:2).,He was sensible of thirst (John 19:28).,He was sensible of weariness (John 4:6).,He was nourished by sleep (Mark 4:38).,He was subject to grief (Mark 3:5).,He was subject to anger (Mark 3:5).,He was subject to weep (John 11:35; Luke 19:41).,"He had joy as a man, and rejoiced (Matt 11:25; Luke 10:21).","These things, I say, Jesus was subject to as a man, as the son of the Virgin.",2.,"The reality of his manhood is yet made manifest by the names the prophets gave him, both in the Old Testament and in the New.","As, (1.)","He is called the 'seed'--the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, the seed of David, by which is meant he was to come of their children (Gen 3:15, 12, 22; Gal 3:16,17; Rom 1:3).",(2.),"Therefore it is added (where mention is made of the fathers), 'of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came.'","He was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; and hence again he calleth himself the offspring of David; therefore, I say, he is said to be of their flesh, their loins, and is called their Son (Rom 1:3, 4:5; Acts 2:30; Rev 22:16).",(3.),"He therefore is frequently called 'a man, and the Son of man'--'Then shall you see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven.'","'When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him.'","'This man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.'","'Wherefore, it is necessary that this man have somewhat also to offer' (Matt 25:31, 26:64; Heb 7:24, 8:3, 10:12).",(4.),What shall I say?,"He himself gave undeniable demonstration of all this when he said he 'was dead'; when he called to Thomas to put his finger to, and behold his hands, to reach to him his hand and thrust it into his side, and bid him he should not be faithless, but believing.","At another time, when he stood in the midst of the eleven, as they were troubled with the thoughts of unbelief, he said, 'Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have' (John 20:27; Luke 24:39).","Thus have I showed you what it was for Jesus to come into the world--namely, to be born of a woman, to take flesh, and to become God-man in one person.","I come now to the third question; but before I speak particularly to that, I will produce further testimony that we find upon record concerning the truth of all this.",Particular testimonies that this coming of Jesus is his coming to save us.,The Testimony of Simeon.--Simeon the Just gives testimony of him: 'And the Holy Ghost was upon him.,"And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.","And he came by the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,--for mine eyes have seen thy salvation' (Luke 2:25-32).","The Testimony of Anna.--Anna, a prophetess, one 'of a great age,--which departed not from the temple, but served God with fasting and prayers night and day.","And she, coming in at that instant, gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem' (Luke 2:36-38).","The Testimony of John Baptist.--John Baptist, as he fulfilled his ministry, he cried concerning this Jesus, 'Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.--And he,' saith John, 'that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining' or abiding, 'the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.","And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God' (John 1:29-34).","The Testimony of the Star and Wise Men.--The star that appeared at his birth in the east, and that coasted through the heavens till it came over the place where the young child Jesus was, that star gave testimony that he was the Saviour.","This star alarmed many, especially the wise men of the east, who were brought by it from afar to worship him: 'And lo, the star which they saw in the east, went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was.","When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.","And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child, with Mary his mother, and fell down and worshipped him; and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh' (Matt 2:9-11).",The Testimony of the Angels.--1.,"To Mary herself--'And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, -and the virgin's name was Mary.","And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured.--And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favour with God.","And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.","He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end' (Luke 1:26-33).",2.,"The angels' testimony to the shepherds, as they were feeding their flocks in the fields by night--'And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid.","And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.","For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord' (Luke 2:9-11).",3.,"How the angels solemnized his birth among themselves--'And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill towards men' (vv 13,14).",The Testimony of God the Father.--1.,"When he was baptized--'And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water; and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and, lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased' (Matt 3:16,17).",2.,"The Father's testimony of him at his transfiguration--'And he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.","And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.'","And there appeared Moses and Elias talking with him, and a cloud from heaven overshadowed them; at which the three disciples began to be afraid.","Then 'there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, hear him' (Luke 9:28-35).","This is that testimony of God which Peter speaks of, saying, 'We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his majesty.","For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.","And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount' (2 Peter 1:16-18).",3.,"God gave testimony of him by signs and wonders--'Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?","The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father, that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.'","'God also bearing them witness,' that preached salvation by Jesus, 'both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will' (John 14:10; Heb 2:4).","Concerning Jesus, how he put himself upon the test among his adversaries.",The Lord Jesus also putteth himself upon the test among his adversaries divers ways.,First.,"He urgeth the time of the appearing of the Messias to be come--'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel' (Mark 1:15).",For this he had a threefold proof--1.,"The heathens had invaded and taken the land, according to that of Daniel (9:25,26).",2.,"The sceptre was departed from Judah, according to that of Jacob (Gen 49:10).","To which also suited that prophecy: 'Before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings' (Isa 7:16).",3.,"The Roman emperor had not only subdued the nation, and put down the kingly race of the Jews, but had set up and established his own power over them.","In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea; Herod was tetrarch of Galilee; Philip, tetrarch of Iturea; and Lysanias, tetrarch of Abilene; all heathens, and of Tiberius' making.","Besides, the kingly race of Judah was at this time become so low by reason of the Roman oppression, that the chief of them were put to get their living by their own hands; even Joseph, the supposed father of Jesus, was then become a carpenter.",Poor man!,"when Jesus was born, he was fain to thrust into a stable, for there was in the inn no room for such guests as they.","The offering also which was brought unto God at the time when Jesus was presented unto the Lord, was two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons--a sacrifice allowed only for them that were poor, and could provide no bigger--'And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, the one for the burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering' (Lev 12:8).","Besides, Jesus himself saith, 'Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.'","Now, I say, all these things were so apparent to the Jews, that they could not object; they felt the Romans were come, they knew the sceptre was gone, they smarted under the Roman tyranny, and knew the kingly race of Judea was overthrown.","How, then, could they object that the time was not come for Christ to be born?","Further, the people were generally convinced that the time was come, and therefore, saith the text, they were in expectation.","'And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ or not' (Luke 3:15).","The unbiased people, observing the face of things, could do no other but look for the Messias.","And hence it is that the Lord Jesus gives the Pharisees, those mortal enemies of his, such sore rebukes, saying, 'O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky, but can ye not discern the signs of the times?'","The kingdom is lost, the heathens are come, and the sceptre is departed from Judah.","'Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky, and of the earth, but how is it that ye do not discern this time?'",(Matt 16:3; Luke 12:56).,Second.,"He yet again puts himself upon the test by the miracles which he wrought before them--'Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me, or else believe me for the very works' sake' (John 14:11).","'For the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me' (John 5:36.)","This proof they could not withstand, but granted that he did many miracles, while they did nothing.","'Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we?",for this man doeth many miracles.,"If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans shall come, and take away both our place and nation' (John 11:47,48).","Yea, so did Jesus confound them, that by their own records and laws, by which they were to prove persons clean or unclean, they, in reading their lectures, did justify him, and overthrow themselves.","For instance, it was written in their law, 'If he that hath an issue spit upon him that is clean,' that spittle should make him unclean (Lev 15:8).","Now Jesus, whom they counted most unclean, because he said he was the Son of God, as they thought, speaking blasphemy, he spits upon people, and makes them whole.","He spat, and made clay with the spittle, and with that clay made a blind man see (John 9:6).","Also he spat on the eyes of another, and made him see (Mark 8:23-25).","Again, he spat, and with his spittle touched the tongue of one that was dumb, and made him speak immediately (Mark 7:33-35).","Thus he proved himself clear of their accusations, and maintained before them that by their law he was guiltless, and the Son of God; for the miracles which he wrought were to prove him so to be.","Again, in their law it was written that whoso toucheth the altar of incense should be holy (Exo 29:37).","A woman with a bloody issue touched him, and is whole of her plague (Mark 5:28).","Yea, they brought to him many diseased persons, 'and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment; and as many as touched were made perfectly whole' (Matt 14:36).","Thus was he justified before them out of their own law, and had his glory manifest before their faces, to their everlasting confusion and contempt.","Indeed, the Jews did make one objection against Jesus Christ that seemed to them to have weight in it, and that was, because he first began to appear and manifest his glory in Cana of Galilee.","At this, I say, they stumbled.","It was their sore temptation; for still, as some affirmed him to be the Christ, others as fast objected, 'Shall Christ come out of Galilee?'",'Art thou also of Galilee?,"Search and look; for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet' (John 2:1,11, 7:40-42,52).","But this their stumble might arise either from the cruelty of Herod, or from their own not observing and keeping mind the alarm that God gave them at his birth.",1.,"It might arise or be occasioned through the cruelty of Herod; for Jesus was born in Bethlehem, the city where David dwelt.","But when Herod sent out to kill him, and for his sake killed all the young children in Bethlehem, then was Joseph warned by an angel of God to take the young child and his mother, and fly into Egypt, and so he did, and was there till the death of Herod (Matt 2:1,13,16).","After this, the angel comes to them in Egypt, and bids them take the young child, and return into the land of Israel; wherefore they arose and went.","But hearing that Herod's son, that tyrant, ruled in the room of his father, they were afraid to go to Bethlehem, but turned aside into the parts of Galilee, where they remained till the time of his showing to Israel (Matt 2:19-23).",2.,This stumble of theirs might arise from their not observing and keeping in mind the alarm that God gave them of his birth.,(1.),"God began to give them the alarm at the birth of John the Baptist, where was asserted that he was to go before the face of the Lord Jesus, and to prepare his ways.","'And fear came on all that dwelt round about them, and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea' (Luke 1:65).",(2.),"Again, what a continuation of this alarm was there also at the birth of Jesus, which was about three months after John Baptist was born?",Now come the angels from heaven.,"Now comes a strange star over the country to lead the men of the east to the stable where Jesus was born; now was Herod, the priests, the scribes, and also the city of Jerusalem, awakened and sore troubled; for it was noised by the wise men that Christ the King and Saviour was born.","Besides the shepherds, Simeon and Anna gave notice of him to the people.","They should, therefore, have retained the memory of these things, and have followed God in all his dark providences, until his Sun of Righteousness should arise among them with healing under his wings.",3.,I may add another cause of their stumble--they did not understand the prophecies that went before of him.,(1.),He was to come to them out of Egypt--'Out of Egypt have I called my Son' (Matt 2:15; Hosea 11:1).,(2.),"He turned aside into Cana of Galilee, and dwelt in the city of Nazareth, 'that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene' (Matt 2:23).",(3.),"That saying also was to be fulfilled, 'The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; the people which sat in darkness saw great light, and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up' (Matt 4:15,16; Isa 9:2, 42:7).","At these things, then, they stumbled, and it was a great judgment of God upon them.","Besides, there seemed to be a contradiction in the prophecies of the Scripture concerning his coming.","He was to be born in Bethlehem, and yet to come out of Egypt.","How should he be the Christ, and yet come out of Galilee, out of which ariseth no prophet?",Thus they stumbled.,"Hence note, that though the prophecies and promises be full and plain as these were, that he should be born in Bethlehem, yet men's sins may cause them to be fulfilled in such obscurity, that instead of having benefit thereby, they may stumble and split their souls thereat.","Take heed then; hunt not Christ from plain promises with Herod, hunt him not from Bethlehem, lest he appear to your amazement and destruction from Egypt, or in the land of Zabulon!","But this much to the second question; to wit, What it was for Jesus to come into the world.",I come now to the third question.,[WHAT IT WAS FOR JESUS TO COME TO BE A SAVIOUR.],QUEST.,THIRD.,What it was for him to come to be a Saviour.,For the further handling of this question I must show--First.,What it is to be a Saviour.,Second.,What it is to come to be a Saviour.,Third.,What it is for Jesus to come to be a Saviour.,To these three briefly-- First.,What it is TO BE a Saviour.,1.,"A saviour supposeth some in misery, and himself one that is to deliver them.",2.,A saviour is either such an one ministerially or meritoriously.,"Ministerially is, when one person engageth or is engaged by virtue of respect or command from superiors, to go and obtain, by conquest or the king's redemption, the captives, or persons grieved by the tyranny of an enemy.","And thus were Moses and Joshua, and the judges and kings of Israel, saviours--'Thou deliveredst them into the hands of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies' (Neh 9:27).","Thus was Jesus Christ a Saviour; he was engaged by virtue of respect and command from God to obtain, by conquest and redemption, the captives or persons grieved.",God sent his Son to be 'the Saviour of the world' (John 4:42).,"Meritoriously is, when the person engaging shall, at his own proper cost and charge, give a sufficient value or price for those he redeemeth.",Thus those under the law were redeemed by the money called the redemption-money--'And Moses gave the money of those that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons' (Num 3:46-51).,And thus was Jesus Christ a Saviour.,"He paid full price to Divine justice for sinners, even his own precious blood--'Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation, received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ' (1 Peter 1:18,19).","And forasmuch as, in man's redemption, the undertaker must have respect, not only to the paying of a price, but also to the getting of a victory; for there is not only justice to satisfy, but death, devil, hell, and the grave, to conquer; therefore hath he also by himself gotten the victory over these.",He hath abolished death (2 Tim 1:10).,"He hath destroyed the devil (Heb 2:14,15).",He hath been the destruction of the grave (Hosea 13:14).,He hath gotten the keys of hell (Rev 1:18).,"And this, I say, he did by himself, at his own proper cost and charge, when he triumphed over them upon his cross (Col 2:14,15).",Second.,What it is TO COME to be a Saviour.,1.,"To come to be one, supposeth one ordained and fore-prepared for that work--'Then said he, Lo, I come, a body hast thou prepared me' (Heb 10).",2.,"To come to be a Saviour supposeth one commissionated or authorized to that work--'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me,' authorized me, 'to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent met to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised' (Luke 4:18).","And upon this account it is that he is so often called Christ, or the Anointed One; the anointed Jesus, or Jesus the Anointed Saviour.","'Thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.'",'This Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.',"He 'testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ,' 'and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving' by the Scriptures 'that this is very Christ' (John 11:27; Acts 9:22, 17:3, 18:5); the very anointed of God, or he whom God authorized and qualified to be the Saviour of the world.",3.,"To come to be a Saviour supposeth a resolution to do that work before he goeth back--'I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction; repentance shall be hid from mine eyes' (Hosea 13:14).","And as he resolved, so he hath done.",He hath purged our sins (Heb 1:3).,By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified (Heb 10:14).,He hath obtained eternal redemption for them (Heb 9:12; 2 Tim 1:10; Heb 9:26; Col 2:15; Heb 6:18-20).,Third.,I come now to the third question--What it is for JESUS to come to be a Saviour.,1.,It is the greatest discovery of man's misery and inability to save himself therefrom that ever was made in the world.,Must the Son of God himself come down from heaven?,or can there be no salvation?,Cannot one sinner save another?,"Cannot man by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him?",Cannot an angel do it?,Cannot all the angels do it?,No; Christ must come and die to do it.,2.,"It is the greatest discovery of the love of God that ever the world had, for God so to love the world as to send his Son!",For God so to commend his love to the world as to send it to them in the blood of his Son!,Amazing love!,(John 3:16; Rom 5:8).,3.,"It is the greatest discovery of the condescension of Christ that ever the world had, that he should not come 'to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many' (Matt 20:28).","That he should be manifest for this purpose, 'that he might destroy the works of the devil' (1 John 3:8).","That he should come that we 'might have life, and that we might have it more abundantly' (John 10:10).",That the Son of God should 'come to seek and to save that which was lost' (Luke 19:10).,"That he should not come 'to judge the world, but to save the world' (John 12:47).","That 'Christ Jesus should come into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief' (1 Tim 1:15).","That he should 'love us, and wash us from our sins in his own blood' (Rev 1:5).",What amazing condescension and humility is this!,(Phil 2:6-9).,HOW JESUS CHRIST ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE WORK OF OUR REDEMPTION.,"I come, then, in the next place, to show you how Jesus Christ addressed himself to the work of man's redemption.","The Scripture saith, 'he became poor,' that he made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, that he humbled himself unto death, even the death of the cross.","But particularly, FIRST.",He took upon him our flesh.,SECOND.,He was made under the law.,THIRD.,He took upon him our sins.,FOURTH.,He bore the curse due to our sins.,[HE TOOK UPON HIM OUR FLESH.],FIRST.,He took upon him our flesh.,"I showed you before that he came in our flesh, and now I must show you the reason of it--namely, because that was the way to address himself to the work of our redemption.","Wherefore, when the apostle treated of the incarnation of Christ, he added withal the reason--to wit, that he might be capable to work out the redemption of men.",There are three things to be considered in this first head.,First.,That he took our flesh for this reason--that he might be a Saviour.,Second.,"How he took flesh, that he might be our Saviour.",Third.,"That it was necessary that he should take our flesh, if indeed he will be our Saviour.","[He took our flesh, that he might be a Saviour.]",[First.],For the first.,"That he took our flesh for this reason--that he might be a Saviour: 'For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh' (Rom 8:3).","The sum of the words is, Forasmuch as the law could do us no good, by reason of the inability that is in our flesh to do it--for the law can do us no good until it be fulfilled--and because God had a desire that good should come to us, therefore did he send his Son in our likeness, clothed with flesh, to destroy, by his doing the law, the tendency of the sin that dwells in our flesh.","He therefore took our flesh, that our sin, with its effects, might by him be condemned and overcome.","The reason, therefore, why he took flesh is, because he would be our Saviour--'Forasmuch, then, as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage' (Heb 2:14,15).",In these words it is asserted that he took our flesh for certain reasons.,1.,"Because the children, the heirs of heaven, are partakers of flesh and blood--'Forasmuch, then, as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself took part of the same.'","Had the children, the heirs, been without flesh, he himself had not taken it upon him; had the children been angels, he had taken upon him the nature of angels; but because the children were partakers of flesh, therefore leaving angels, or refusing to take hold of angels, he took flesh and blood, the nature of the children, that he might put himself into a capacity to save and deliver the children; therefore it follows, that 'through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.'",2.,"This, therefore, was another reason--that he might destroy the devil.","The devil had bent himself against the children; he is their adversary, and goeth forth to make war with them--'Your adversary, the devil.--And he went to make war with the remnant of her seed' (1 Peter 5:8; Rev 12:17).","Now the children could not destroy him, because he had already cast them into sin, defiled their nature, and laid them under the wrath of God.","Therefore Christ puts himself among the children, and into the nature of the children, that he might, by means of his dying in their flesh, destroy the devil--that is, take away sin, his [the devil's] work, that he might destroy the works of the devil; for sin is the great engine of hell, by which he overthroweth all that perish.",Now this did Christ destroy by taking on him the similitude of sinful flesh; of which more anon.,3.,"'That he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver them.'","This was the thing in chief intended, that he might deliver the children, that he might deliver them from death, the fruit of their sin, and from sin, the sting of that death--'That he might deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.'","He took flesh, therefore, because the children had it; he took it that he might die for the children; he took it that he might deliver the children from the works of the devil--'that he might deliver them.'","No deliverance had come to the children if the Son of God had not taken their flesh and blood; therefore he took our flesh, that he might be our Saviour.","Again, in a Saviour there must be not only merit, but compassion and sympathy, because the children are yet to live by faith, are not yet come to the inheritance--'Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people' (Heb 2:17,18).","Two reasons are rendered in this text why he must take flesh--namely, that he might be their priest to offer sacrifice, to wit, his body and blood for them; and that he might be merciful and faithful, to pity and preserve them unto the kingdom appointed for them.","Mark you, therefore, how the apostle, when he asserteth that the Lord Jesus took our flesh, urgeth the reason why he took our flesh--that he might destroy the devil and death, that he might deliver them.","It behoveth him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be merciful and faithful, that he might make reconciliation for the sins of the people.","The reason, therefore, why he took our flesh is declared--to wit, that he might be our Saviour.",And hence you find it so often recorded.,He hath 'abolished in his flesh the enmity.',He hath 'slain the enmity' by his flesh.,"'And you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable--in his sight' (Eph 2:15,16; Col 1:21,22).",How he took flesh.,Second.,"I come now to the second question--to wit, How he took our flesh.","This must be inquired into; for his taking flesh was not after the common way; never any took man's flesh upon him as he, since the foundation of the world.",1.,"He took not our flesh like Adam, who was formed out of the ground; 'who was made of the dust of the ground' (Gen 2:7, 3:19).",2.,"He took not our flesh as we do, by carnal generation.","Joseph knew not his wife, neither did Mary know any man, till she had brought forth her first-born son (Matt 1:25; Luke 1:34).",3.,"He took flesh, then, by the immediate working and overshadowing of the Holy Ghost.","And hence it is said expressly, 'She was found with child of the Holy Ghost.'","'Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost' (Matt 1:18).","And hence again, when Joseph doubted of her honesty, for he perceived she was with child, and knew he had not touched her, the angel of God himself comes down to resolve his doubt, and said, 'Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost' (Matt 1:20).","But again, though the Holy Ghost was that by which the child Jesus was formed in the womb, so as to be without carnal generation, yet was he not formed in her without, but by, her conception--'Behold, thou shalt conceive in they womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS' (Luke 1:31).","Wherefore he took flesh not only in, but of, the Virgin.","Hence he is called her son, the seed of the woman; and hence it is also that he is called the seed of Abraham, the seed of David; their seed, according to the flesh (Gen 12, 13:15, 22; Luke 1:31, 2:7; Rom 1:3, 9:5; Gal 3:16, 4:4).","And this, the work he undertook, required, 1.",It required that he should take our flesh.,2.,"It required that he should take our flesh without sin, which could not be had he taken it by reason of a carnal generation; for so all children are conceived in, and polluted with, sin (Psa 51).","And the least pollution, either of flesh or spirit, had utterly disabled him for the work, which to do, he came down from heaven.","Therefore, 'such an High-priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens' (Heb 7:26).","This mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God was thus completed, I say, that he might be in all points like as we are, yet without sin; for sin in the flesh disableth and maketh incapable to do the commandment.","Therefore was he thus made, thus made of a woman; and this the angel assigneth as the reason of this his marvellous incarnation.","'The Holy Ghost,' saith he, 'shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God' (Luke 1:35).","The overshadowing of the Holy Ghost and the power of the Highest--the Father and the Holy Ghost--brought this wonderful thing to pass, for Jesus is a wonderful one in his conception and birth.",This mystery is that next to the mystery of three persons in one God; it is a great mystery.,'Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh.',"The conclusion is, that Jesus Christ took our flesh that he might be our Saviour; and that he might be our Saviour indeed, he thus took our flesh.",That it was necessary that he should take our flesh if he will be our Saviour.,Third.,"I come now to the third thing--namely, that it was necessary that he should take our flesh if he will be our Saviour.",1.,"And that, first, from the nature of the work; his work was to save, to save man, sinking man, man that was 'going down to the pit' (Job 33:24).","Now, he that will save him that is sinking must take hold on him.","And since he was not to save a man, but men, therefore it was necessary that he should take hold, not of one person, but of the common nature, clothing himself with part of the same.","He took not hold of angels, 'but he took on him the seed of Abraham' (Heb 2:16).","For that flesh was the same with the whole lump of the children to whom the promise was made, and comprehended in it the body of them that shall be saved, even as in Adam was comprehended the whole world at first (Rom 5).","Hence we are said to be chosen in him, to be gathered, being in him, to be dead by him, to be risen with him, and to be set with him, or in him, in heavenly places already (Rom 7:4; Eph 1:4,10; Col 2:12,13, 3:1-3).","This, then, was the wisdom of the great God, that the Eternal Son of his love should take hold of, and so secure the sinking souls of perishing sinners by assuming their flesh.",2.,The manner of his doing the work of a Saviour did call for his taking of our flesh.,He must do the work by dying.,'Ought not Christ to have suffered?,"Christ must needs have suffered,' or else no glory follows (Luke 24:26; Acts 17:3).","'The prophets testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow' (1 Peter 1:11).","Yea, they did it by the Spirit, even by the Spirit of Christ himself.","This Spirit, then, did bid them tell the world, yea, testify, that Christ must suffer, or no man be blest with glory; for the threatening of death and the curse of the law lay in the way between heaven gates and the souls of the children, for their sins; wherefore he that will save them must answer Divine justice, or God must lie, in saving them without inflicting the punishment threatened.","Christ, then, must needs have suffered; the manner of the work laid a necessity upon him to take our flesh upon him; he must die, he must die for us, he must die for our sins.","And this was effectually foretold by all the bloody sacrifices that were offered under the law--the blood of bulls, the blood of lambs, the blood of rams, the blood of calves, and the blood of goats and birds.","These bloody sacrifices, what did they signify, what were they figures of, but of the bloody sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ?","their blood being a shadow of his blood, and their flesh being a shadow of his flesh.","Therefore, when God declared that he took no pleasure in them, because they could not make the worshippers perfect as pertaining to the conscience, then comes Jesus Christ to offer his sinless body and soul for the sin of the people--'For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sin.","Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifices and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me; in burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.","Then said I, Lo, I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God.'","Since burnt-offerings cannot do thy will, my body shall; since the blood of bulls and goats cannot do thy will, my blood shall.","Then follows, By the will of God 'we are sanctified, through the offering up of the body of Jesus Christ once for all' (Heb 10:4-10).",3.,"The end of the work required that Christ, if he will be our Saviour, should take upon him our flesh.","The end of our salvation is, that we might enjoy God, and that he by us might be glorified for ever and ever.",(1.),That we might enjoy God.,"'I will dwell in them, and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.'","This indwelling of God, and consequently our enjoyment of him, begins first in its eminency by his possessing our flesh in the person of Jesus Christ.","Hence his name is called 'Immanuel, God with us'; and 'the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.'","The flesh of Christ is the tabernacle which the Lord pitched, according to that saying, 'The tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God' (Rev 21:3).","Here God beginneth to discover his glory, and to be desirable to the sons of men.","God could not communicate himself to us, nor take us into the enjoyment of himself, but with respect to that flesh which his Son took of the Virgin, because sin stood betwixt.","Now this flesh only was the holy lump, in this flesh God could dwell; and forasmuch as this flesh is the same with ours, and was taken up with intent that what was done in and by that, should be communicated to all the children; therefore through that doth God communicate of himself unto his people--'God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself' (2 Cor 5:19).","And 'I am the way,' saith Christ, 'no man cometh unto the Father but by me' (John 14:6).",That passage to the Hebrews is greatly to our purpose.,"We have boldness, brethren, 'to enter into the holiest,' the place where God is, 'by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh' (Heb 10:19,20).","Wherefore by the flesh and blood of Christ we enter into the holiest; through the veil, saith he, that is to say, his flesh.",(2.),"As the end of our salvation is that we might enjoy God, so also it is that he by us might be glorified for ever--'That God in all things might be glorified, through Jesus Christ our Lord.'","Here indeed will the mystery of his grace, wisdom, justice, power, holiness, and glory, inhabit eternal praise, while we that are counted worthy of the kingdom of God shall admire at the mystery, and see ourselves, without ourselves, even by the flesh and blood of Christ through faith therein, effectually and eternally saved.","Oh, this will be the burden of our eternal joy--God loved us, and gave his Son for us; Christ loved us, and gave his flesh for our life, and his blood for our eternal redemption and salvation!",THAT CHRIST WAS MADE UNDER THE LAW.,SECOND.,"But, secondly CHRIST WAS MADE UNDER THE LAW--'When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law' (Gal 4:4).","Of right, being found in flesh, he must needs be under the law, for that there is not any creature above or without law to God; but this is not to the point in hand.","Christ was not therefore under the law because he was found in flesh, but he took flesh, and designedly put himself, or was made under the law; wherefore it is added, He was made under the law to 'redeem,' to redeem them that were under that law.","Wherefore, here is a design, a heavenly contrivance and device on foot; Christ is made--that is, by design subjected--under the law, for the sake and upon the account of others, 'to redeem them that were under the law.'","Made under the law--that is, put himself into the room of sinners, into the condition of sinners; made himself subject to the same pains and penalties we were obnoxious to.","We were under the law, and it had dominion over us, bound us upon pain of eternal damnation to do completely all things written in the law.",This condition Christ put himself into that 'he might redeem'; for assuredly we had else perished.,"The law had dominion over us, and since we had sinned, of right it pronounced the curse, and made all men subject to the wrath of God.","Christ, therefore, did not only come into our flesh, but also into our condition, into the valley and shadow of death where we were, and where we are, as we are sinners.",He that is under the law is under the edge of the axe.,"When David was to go to visit his brethren, and to save them from the hand of Goliath, he was to look how his brethren fared, and to 'take their pledge' (1 Sam 17:18).","This is true of Jesus Christ when he came to save us from the hand of death and the law; he looked how his brethren fared, took to heart their deplorable condition, and put himself into the same plight--to wit, under the law, that he might redeem them that were under the law.","I told you before that he came sinless into the world, that he had a miraculous conception, and wonderful birth; and here you see a reason for it, he was to be put, or made, under the law, 'to redeem.'","He that will be made under the law to redeem, had need be sinless and spotless himself; for the law findeth fault with the least, and condemneth man for the first beginning of, sin.","Without this, then, there could not have been redemption, nor any the sons of God by adoption: no redemption, because the sentence of death had already passed upon all; no sons by adoption, because that is the effect of redemption.","'God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.'","Christ, then, by being made under the law, hath recovered his from under the law, and obtained for them the privilege of the adoption of sons.","For, as I told you before, Christ stood a common[3] person, presenting in himself the whole lump of the promised seed, or the children of the promise; wherefore he comes under the law for them, takes upon him to do what the law required of them, takes upon him to do it for them.","He began, therefore, at the first tittle of the law, and going in man's flesh, for man, through the law, he becomes 'the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.'",The END of the law--what is the end of the law but perfect and sinless obedience?,"that is the end of the law, both with respect to its nature, and the cause of its being imposed.","God gave the law, that complete righteousness should by that be found upon men; but because sin was got into man's flesh, therefore this righteousness, by us, could not be completed.","Now comes Christ the Lord into the world, clothes himself with the children's flesh, addresseth himself to the work of their redemption, is made under the law; and going through every part of the law without sin, he becometh 'the end of the law for' justifying 'righteousness to every one that believeth' (Rom 10:4).","For he obeyed not the law for himself, he needed no obedience thereto; it was we that needed obedience, it was we that wanted to answer the law; we wanted it but could not obtain it, because then the law was weak through the flesh; therefore God sent his own Son, and he did our duty for us, even to become the end of the law to every one that believeth.","In this, therefore, Christ laboured for us, he was made under the law to redeem.","Therefore, as I said before, it behoved him to be sinless, because the law binds over to answer for sin at the bar of the judgment of God.","Therefore did his Godhead assume our human flesh, in a clean and spotless way, that he might come under 'the law, to redeem them that were under the law.'","For, consisting of two natures, and the personality lying in the Godhead, which gave value and worth to all things done for us by the manhood, the obedience takes denomination from thence, to be the obedience of God.","The Son's righteousness, the Son's blood; the righteousness of God, the blood of God (Heb 5:8,9; Phil 3:9; Acts 20:28; 1 John 3:16).","Thus Jesus Christ came into the world under the law to redeem, not simply as God, but God-man, both natures making one Christ.","The Godhead, therefore, did influence and give value to the human flesh of Christ in all its obedience to the law, else there would have been wanting that perfection of righteousness which only could answer the demands and expectation of the justice of God; to wit, perfect righteousness by flesh.","But the second Person in the Godhead, the Son, the Word, coming under the law for men in their flesh, and subjecting himself by that flesh to every tittle and demand of the law; all and every whit of what was acted and done by Jesus Christ, God-man, for us, it was and is the righteousness of God; and since it was not done for himself, but for us, as he saith in the text, 'to redeem,' the righteousness by which we are set free from the law is none other but the righteousness that alone resideth in the person of the Son of God.","And that it is absolutely necessary thus it should be, is evident, both with respect to God and also with respect to man.",With respect to God.,The righteousness is demanded by God; therefore he that comes to redeem must present before God a righteousness absolutely perfect; this can be done by none but God.,With respect to man.,Man was to present this righteousness to God; therefore must the undertaker be man.,"Man for man, and God for God, God-man between God and man.","This daysman can lay his hand upon us both, and bring God and man together in peace (Job 9:33).",Quest.,"But some may say, what need of the righteousness of one that is naturally God?","Had Adam, who was but a mere man, stood in his innocency, and done his duty, he had saved himself and all his posterity.",Answ.,"Had Adam stood, he had so long secured himself from the wages of sin, and posterity so long as they were in him.","But had Adam sinned, yea, although he had not defiled his nature with filth, he could never after that have redeemed himself from the curse of the law, because he was not equal with God; for the curse of the law is the curse of God; but no man can deliver himself from the curse of God, having first transgressed.","This is evident, because angels, for sin, lie bound in chains, and can never deliver themselves.","He, therefore, that redeemeth man from under the law must not only do all the good that the law requireth, but bear all the penalty that is due by the law for sin.","Should an angel assume human flesh, and in that flesh do the law, this righteousness would not redeem a sinner; it would be but the righteousness of an angel, and so, far short of such a righteousness as can secure a sinner from the wrath of God.","But 'thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy soul, with all thy heart, with all thy mind, with all thy strength.'","If there were no more required of us now to redeem ourselves, it would be utterly impossible for us to do it, because in the best there is sin, which will intermix itself with every duty of man.","This being so, all the heart, all the soul, all the strength, and all the mind, to the exact requirement of the justice of the law, can never be found in a natural man.","Besides, for this work there is required a perfect memory, always to keep in mind the whole duty of man, the whole of every tittle of all the law, lest sin come in by forgetfulness; a perfect knowledge and judgment, lest sin come in by ignorance; an everlasting unweariedness in all, lest sin and continual temptation tire the soul, and cause it to fail before the whole be done.","For the accomplishing of this last, he must have--1.","A perfect willingness, without the least thought to the contrary.",2.,Such a hatred of sin as is not to be found but in the heart of God.,3.,"A full delight in every duty, and that in the midst of all temptations.",4.,A continuing in all things to the well-pleasing of the justice of God.,"I say, should the penalty of the law be taken off, should God forgive the penalty and punishment due to sins that are past, and only demand good works now, according to the tenor of the law, no man could be saved; there would not be found that heart, that soul, that mind, and that strength, anywhere in the world.","This, therefore, must cease for ever, unless the Son of God will put his shoulder to the work; but, blessed be God, he hath done it--'When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.'",CHRIST TOOK UPON HIM OUR SINS.,THIRD.,"But thirdly, CHRIST OUR SAVIOUR TAKES UPON HIM OUR SINS.",This is another step to the work of our redemption.,'He hath made him to be sin for us.',Strange doctrine!,A fool would think it blasphemy; but Truth hath said it.,"Truth, I say, hath said, not that he was made to sin, but that God made him to be sin--'He hath made him to be sin for us' (2 Cor 5:21).","This, therefore, showeth us how effectually Christ Jesus undertook the work of our redemption--He was made to be sin for us.",Sin is the great block and bar to our happiness; sin is the procurer of all miseries to men both here and for ever.,"Take away sin, and nothing can hurt us; for death temporal, death spiritual, and death eternal, are the wages of sin (Rom 6:23).","Sin, then, and man for sin, is the object of the wrath of God.","If the object of the wrath of God, then is his case most dreadful; for who can bear, who can grapple with the wrath of God?","Men cannot, angels cannot, the whole world cannot.","All, therefore, must sink under sin, but he who is made to be sin for us; he only can bear sins, he only can bear them away, and therefore were they laid upon him--'The Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all' (Isa 53:6).","Mark, therefore, and you shall find that the reason why God made him to be sin for us was, 'that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.'","He took our flesh, he was made under the law, and was made to be sin for us, that the devil might be destroyed, that the captives might be redeemed, and made the righteousness of God in him.","And forasmuch as he saith that God 'hath made him to be sin,' it declareth that the design of God and the mystery of his will and grace was in it.",'He hath made him to be sin.',"God hath done it, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.",There was no other way; the wisdom of heaven could find no other way; we could not by other means stand just before the justice of God.,"Now, what remains but that we who are reconciled to God by faith in his blood are quit, discharged, and set free from the law of sin and death?","Yea, what encouragement to trust in him, when we read that God 'made him to be sin for us.'",Quest.,But how was Jesus Christ made of God to be sin for us?,Answ.,"Even so as if himself had committed all our sins; that is, they were as really charged upon him as if himself had been the actor and committer of them all.","'He hath made him to be sin,' not only as a sinner, but as sin itself.",He was as the sin of the world that day he stood before God in our stead.,"Some, indeed, will not have Jesus Christ our Lord to be made sin for us; their wicked reasons think this to be wrong judgment in the Lord; it seems, supposing that because they cannot imagine how it should be, therefore God, if he does it, must do it at his peril, and must be charged with doing wrong judgment, and so things that become not his heavenly Majesty; but against this duncish sophistry[4] we set Paul and Isaiah, the one telling us still, 'the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all'; and the other, that 'God made him to be sin for us.'","But these men, as I suppose, think it enough for Christ to die under that notion only, not knowing nor feeling the burden of sin, and the wrath of God due thereto.","These make him as senseless in his dying, and as much without reason, as a silly sheep or goat, who also died for sin, but so as in name, in show, in shadow only.","They felt not the proper weight, guilt, and judgment of God for sin.","But thou, sinner, who art so in thine own eyes, and who feelest guilt in thine own conscience, know thou that Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God in flesh, was made to be sin for thee, or stood sensibly guilty of all thy sins before God, and bare them in his own body upon the cross.","God charged our sins upon Christ, and that in their guilt and burden, what remaineth but that the charge was real or feigned?","If real, then he hath either perished under them, or carried them away from before God; if they were charged but feignedly, then did he but feignedly die for them, then shall we have but feigned benefit by his death, and but a feigned salvation at last--not to say how this cursed doctrine chargeth God and Christ with hypocrisy, the one in saying, He made Christ to be sin; the other in saying that he bare our sin; when, in deed and in truth, our guilt and burden never was really upon him.",Quest.,But might not Christ die for our sins but he needs must bear their guilt or burden?,Answ.,"He that can sever sin and guilt, sin and the burden, each from other, laying sin and no guilt, sin and no burden on the person that dieth for sin, must do it only in his own imaginative head.","No scripture, nor reason, nor sense, understandeth or feeleth sin when charged without its guilt and burden.",And here we must distinguish between sin charged and sin forgiven.,"Sin forgiven may be seen without guilt or burden, though I think not without shame in this world; but sin charged, and that by the justice of God--for so it was upon Christ--this cannot be but guilt and the burden, as inseparable companions, must unavoidably lie on that person.","Poor sinner, be advised to take heed of such deluded preachers who, with their tongues smoother than oil, would rob thee of that excellent doctrine, 'God hath made him to be sin for us'; for such, as I said, do not only present thee with a feigned deliverance and forgiveness, with a feigned heaven and happiness, but charge God and the Lord Jesus as mere impostors, who, while they tell us that Christ was made of God to be sin for us, affirm that it was not so really, suggesting this sophistical reason, 'No wrong judgment comes from the Lord.'","I say again, this wicked doctrine is the next way to turn the gospel in thy thoughts to no more than a cunningly-devised fable (2 Peter 1:16), and to make Jesus Christ, in his dying for our sins, as brutish as the paschal lamb in Moses' law.","Wherefore, distressed sinner, when thou findest it recorded in the Word of truth that Christ died for our sins, and that God hath made him to be sin for us, then do thou consider of sin as it is a transgression against the law of God, and that as such it procureth the judgment of God, torments and afflicts the mind with guilt, and bindeth over the soul to answer it.","Sever not sin and guilt asunder, lest thou be an hypocrite like these wicked men, and rob Christ of his true sufferings.","Besides, to see sin upon Christ, but not its guilt; to see sin upon Christ, but not the legal punishment, what is this but to conclude that either there is no guilt and punishment in sin, or that Christ bare our sin, but we the punishment?","for the punishment must be borne, because the sentence is gone out from the mouth of God against sin.","Do thou therefore, as I have said, consider of sin as a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4), and a provoker of the justice of God; which done, turn thine eye to the cross, and behold those sins, in the guilt and punishment of them, sticking in the flesh of Christ.",'God condemned sin in the flesh' of Christ (Rom 8:3).,He 'bare our sins in his own body on the tree' (1 Peter 2:24).,"I would only give thee this caution--Not sin in the nature of sin--sin was not so in the flesh of Christ; but sin in the natural punishment of it--to wit, guilt, and the chastising hand of justice.","'He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed' (Isa 53:5).","Look, then, upon Christ crucified to be as the sin of the world, as if he only had broken the law; which done, behold him perfectly innocent in himself, and so conclude that for the transgression of God's people he was stricken; that when the Lord made him to be sin, he made him to be sin for us.",[5] HE WAS MADE A CURSE FOR US.,FOURTH.,"As he was made flesh under the law, and also sin, SO HE WAS MADE A CURSE FOR US--'Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us; as it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.'","This sentence is taken out of Moses, being passed there upon them that for sin are worthy of death--'And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and thou hang him on a tree, his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in anywise bury him that day, for he that is hanged is accursed of God' (Deut 21:22,23).","By this sentence Paul concludeth that Jesus Christ was justly hanged, because sin worthy of death was upon him; sin, not of his own, but ours.","Since, then, he took our sins, he must be cursed of God; for sin is sin wherever it lies, and justice is justice wherever it finds it; wherefore since Jesus Christ will bear our sin, he must be 'numbered with the transgressors,' and counted worthy to die the death.",He that committeth sin is worthy of death.,"This, though Christ did not personally do, his members, his body, which is his church did; and since he would undertake for them with God, and stand in their sins before the eyes of his justice, he must die the death by the law.",Sin and the curse cannot be severed.,Sin must be followed with the curse of God.,"Sin therefore being removed from us to the back of Christ, thither goes also the curse; for if sin be found upon him, he is the person worthy to die--worthy by our sins.","Wherefore Paul here setteth forth Christ clothed with our sins, and so taking from us the guilt and punishment.","What punishment, but the wrath and displeasure of God?--'Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.'","In this word 'curse' are two things comprised, 1.","The reality of sin; for there can be no curse where there is no sin, either of the person's own, or made to be his by his own consent or the imputation of Divine justice.","And since sins are made to be Christ's by imputation, they are his, though not naturally, yet really, and consequently the wages due.",He hath made him to be sin; he was made a curse for us.,2.,"This word 'curse' compriseth, therefore, the punishment of sin, that punishment properly due to sin from the hand of God's justice, which punishment standeth in three things--(1.)",In charging sin upon the body and soul of the person concerned; and hence we read that both the body and soul of Christ 'were made an offering for sin' (Isa 53:10; Heb 10:10).,(2.),"The punishment standeth in God's inflicting of the just merits of sin upon him that standeth charged therewith, and that is death in its own nature and strength; to wit, death with the sting thereof--'The sting of death is sin.'",This death did Christ die because he died for our sins.,(3.),"The sorrows and pains of this death, therefore, must be undergone by Jesus Christ.",Now there are divers sorrows in death--such sorrows as brutes are subject to; such sorrows as persons are subject to that stand in sin before God; such sorrows as those undergo who are swallowed up of the curse and wrath of God for ever.,"Now so much of all kinds of sorrow as the imputation of our sin could justly bring from the hand of Divine justice, so much of it he had.",He had death.,"He had the sting of death, which is sin.",He was forsaken of God; but could not by any means have those sorrows which they have that are everlastingly swallowed up of them.,'It was not possible that he should be holden of it' (Acts 2:24).,"For where sin is charged and borne, there must of necessity follow the wrath and curse of God.","Now where the wrath and curse of God is, there must of necessity follow the effects, the natural effects--I say, the natural effects--to wit, the sense, the sorrowful sense of the displeasure of an infinite Majesty, and his chastisements for the sin that hath provoked him.","There are effects natural, and effects accidental; those accidental are such as flow from our weakness, whilst we wrestle with the judgment of God--to wit, hellish fear, despair, rage, blasphemy, and the like; these were not incident to Jesus Christ, he being in his own person every way perfect.",Neither did he always endure the natural effects; his merits relieved and delivered him.,"God loosed the pains of death, 'because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.'","Christ then was made a curse for us, for he did bear our sin; the punishment therefore from the revenging hand of God must needs fall upon him.","Wherefore by these four things we see how Christ became our Saviour--he took hold of our nature, was born under the law, was made to be sin, and the accursed of God for us.","And observe it--all this, as I said before, was the handiwork of God.","God made him flesh, made him under the law, God made him to be sin, and also a curse for us.","The Lord bruised him, the Lord put him to grief, the Lord made his soul an offering for sin (Isa 53:10).","Not for that he hated him, considering him in his own harmless, innocent, and blessed person, for he was daily his delight; but by an act of grace to us-ward, were our iniquities laid upon him, and he in our stead was bruised and chastised for them.","God loved us, and made him a curse for us.","He was made a curse for us, 'that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through [faith in] Jesus Christ' (Gal 3:14).",FURTHER DEMONSTRATION OF THIS TRUTH.,"Before I pass this truth, I will present thee, courteous reader, with two or three demonstrations for its further confirmation.",First.,"That Christ did bear our sins and curse is clear, because he died, and that without a mediator.",He died--'The wages of sin is death' (Rom 6:23).,"Now if death be the wages of sin, and that be true that Christ did die and not sin, either the course of justice is perverted, or else he died for our sins; there was 'no cause of death in him,' yet he died (Acts 13:28).","He did no evil, guile was not found in his mouth, yet he received the wages of sin (1 Peter 2:22).","Sin, therefore, though not of his own, was found upon him, and laid to his charge, because 'he died.'","'Christ died for our sins,' Christ 'gave himself for our sins' (1 Cor 15:1-3; Gal 1:4).","He, then, that will conclude that Christ did not bear our sin, chargeth God foolishly, for delivering him up to death; for laying on him the wages, when in no sense he deserved the same.","Yea, he overthroweth the whole gospel, for that hangeth on this hinge--'Christ died for our sins.'",Object.,But all that die do not bear the curse of God for sin.,Answ.,But all that die without a mediator do.,"Angels died the cursed death because Christ took not hold of them; and they for whom Christ never prayeth, they die the cursed death, for they perish everlastingly in the unutterable torments of hell.","Christ, too, died that death which is the proper wages of sin, for he had none to stand for him.","'I looked,' saith he, 'and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me.--And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore his arm brought salvation unto him, and his righteousness it sustained him' (Isa 63:5, 54:16).","Christ then died, or endured the wages of sin, and that without an intercessor, without one between God and him; he grappled immediately with the eternal justice of God, who inflicted on him death, the wages of sin; there was no man to hold off the hand of God; justice had his full blow at him, and made him a curse for sin.","He died for sin without a mediator, he died the cursed death.",Second.,"A second thing that demonstrateth that Christ died the cursed death for sin; it is, the frame of spirit that he was in at the time that he was to be taken.","Never was poor mortal so beset with the apprehensions of approaching death, as was this Lord Jesus Christ; amazement beyond measure, sorrow that exceeded, seized upon his soul.","'My soul,' saith he, 'is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.'","'And he began,' saith Mark, 'to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy' (Matt 26:38; Mark 14:33).","Add to this, that Jesus Christ was better able to grapple with death, even better able to do it alone, than the whole world joined all together.",1.,He was anointed with the Spirit without measure (John 3:34).,2.,He had all grace perfect in him (John 1:16).,3.,Never none so soaked in the bosom of his Father's love as himself (Prov 8:23-30).,4.,"Never none so harmless and without sin as he was, and, consequently, never man had so good a conscience as he had (Heb 7:26).",5.,Never none prepared such a stock of good works to bear him company at the hour of death as he.,6.,Never none had greater assurance of being with the Father eternally in the heavens than he.,"And yet, behold, when he comes to die, how weak is he, how amazed at death, how heavy, how exceeding sorrowful!","and, I say, no cause assigned but the approach of death.",Alas!,"how often is it seen that we poor sinners can laugh at destruction when it cometh; yea, and 'rejoice exceedingly when we find the grave,' looking upon death as a part of our portion; yea, as that which will be a means of our present relief and help (Job 3:22; 1 Cor 3:22).","This Jesus Christ could not do, considered as dying for our sin, but the nearer death, the more heavy and oppressed with the thoughts of the revenging hand of God.","Wherefore he falls into an agony, and sweats; not after the common rate as we do when death is severing body and soul--'His sweat was as it were great drops [clodders] of blood falling down to the ground' (Luke 22:44).","What, I say, should be the reason, but that death assaulted him with his sting?","If Jesus Christ had been to die for his virtues only, doubtless he would have borne it lightly, and so he did as he died, bearing witness to the truth, 'He endured the cross, despising the shame' (Heb 12:2).","How have the martyrs despised death, and, as it were, not been careful of that, having peace with God by Jesus Christ, scorning the most cruel torments that hell and men could devise and invent!","but Jesus Christ could not do so, as he was a sacrifice for sin; he died for sin, he was made a curse for us.","O my brethren, Christ died many deaths at once, he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death.",Look how many thousands shall be saved--so many deaths did Jesus die; yet it was but once he died.,"He died thy death, and my death, and so many deaths as all our sins deserved who shall be saved from the wrath to come.","Now, to feign that these sorrows and this bloody agony, was not real, but in show only, what greater condemnation can be passed upon Jesus Christ, who loved to do all things in the most unfeigned simplicity?","It was, therefore, because of sin, the sin that was put into the death he died, and the curse of God that was due to sin, that made death so bitter to Jesus Christ--'It is Christ that died.'","The apostle speaks as if never any died but Christ, nor indeed did there, so wonderful a death as he (Rom 8:34).","Death, considered simply as it is a deprivation of natural life, could not have these effects in a person, personally more righteous than an angel.","Yea, even carnal, wicked men, not awakened in their conscience, how securely can they die!","It must therefore also be concluded that the sorrows and agony of Jesus Christ came from a higher cause, even from the guilt of sin, and from the curse of God that was now approaching for that sin.","It cannot be attributed to the fear of men; their terror could not make him afraid; that was contrary to his doctrine, and did not become the dignity of his person; it was sin, sin, sin, and the curse due to sin.",Third.,"It is evident that Christ did bear and die the cursed death for sin, from the carriage and dispensations of God towards him.",1.,From the carriage of God.,God now becomes as an enemy to him.,(1.),"He forsakes him--'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?'","Yea, the sense of the loss of God's comfortable presence abode with him even till he gave up the ghost.",(2.),"He dealeth with him as with one that hath sinned, he chastiseth him, he bruiseth him, he striketh and smiteth him, and was pleased--that is, his justice was satisfied--in so doing.",'It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief' (Isa 53:10).,"These things could not be, had he only considered him in his own personal standing.",Where was the righteous forsaken?,"Without the consideration of sin, he doth not willingly afflict nor grieve the children of men--that is, not out of pleasure, or without sufficient cause.","Jesus Christ, then, since he is under this withdrawing, chastising, bruising, and afflicting displeasure of God, he is all that time under sin, under our sins, and therefore thus accursed of God, his God.",2.,"Not only the carriage of God, but his dispensations, his visible dispensations, plainly declare that he stood before God in our sins.",Vengeance suffered him not to live.,"Wherefore God delivered him up--'He spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all' (Rom 8:32).",(1.),He delivered him into the hands of men (Mark 9:31).,(2.),He was delivered into the hands of sinners (Luke 24:7).,(3.),He was delivered unto death (Rom 4:25).,(4.),"Yea, so delivered up as that they both had him to put him to death, and God left him for that purpose in their hands; yea, was so far off from delivering him, that he gave way to all things that had a tendency to take his life from the earth.","Now many men do what they will with him, he was delivered to their will--Judas may sell him; Peter may deny him; all his disciples forsake him; the enemy apprehends him, binds him, they have him away like a thief to Caiaphas the high-priest, in whose house he is mocked, spit upon, his beard is twitched from his cheeks; now they buffet him and scornfully bow the knee before him; yea, 'his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men' (Isa 52:14).","Now he is sent to the governor, defaced with blows and blood; who delivereth him into the hand of his soldiers; they whip him, crown him with thorns, and stick the points of the thorns fast in his temples by a blow with a staff in their hand; now he is made a spectacle to the people, and then sent away to Herod, who, with his men of war, set him at nought, no God appearing for his help.","In fine, they at last condemn him to death, even to the death of the cross, where they hang him up by wounds made through his hands and his feet, between the earth and the heavens, where he hanged for the space of six hours--to wit, from nine in the morning till three in the afternoon.","No God yet appears for his help; while he hangs there some rail at him, others wag their heads, others tauntingly say, 'He saved others, himself he cannot save'; some divide his raiment, casting lots for his garments before his face; others mockingly bid him come down from the cross, and when he desireth succour, they give him vinegar to drink.",No God yet appears for his help.,"Now the earth quakes, the rocks are rent, the sun becomes black, and Jesus still cries out that he was forsaken of God; and presently boweth his head and dies (Matt 26, 27; Mark 14, 15; Luke 22, 23; John 18, 19).","And for all this there is no cause assigned from God but sin--'He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed' (Isa 53:5).","The sum then is, that Jesus Christ the Lord, by taking part of our flesh, became a public person, not doing or dying in a private capacity, but in the room and stead of sinners, whose sin deserved death and the curse of God; all which Jesus Christ bare in his own body upon the tree.","I conclude, then, that my sin is already crucified and accursed in the death and curse Christ underwent.",[Objections to this doctrine.],I come now to some objections.,Objection First.,"Christ never was a sinner, God never supposed him to be a sinner, neither did our sins become really his; God never reputed him so to have been; therefore hate or punish him as a sinner he could not; for no false judgment can belong to the Lord.",Answer.--First.,"That Christ was not a sinner personally, by acts or doings of his own, is granted; and in this sense it is true that God did never suppose him to be a sinner, nor punished him as such a sinner, nor did he really, if by really you understand naturally, become our sin, nor did God ever repute him so.",Second.,"But that Christ stood before God in our sins, and that God did not only suppose him so to stand, but set him in them, put them upon him, and counted them as his own, is so true that he cannot at present be a Christian that denies it--'The Lord hath laid upon him the iniquities of us all' (Isa 53:6; 1 Peter 2:22).",Third.,"So, then, though God did not punish him for sin of his own committing, yet he punished him for sin of our committing--'The just suffered for the unjust' (1 Peter 3:18).",Fourth.,"Therefore it is true, that though Christ did never really become sin of his own, he did really become our sin, did really become our curse for sin.","If this be denied, it follows that he became our sin but feignedly, that he was made our curse, or a curse for us but in appearance, show, or in dissimulation; but no such action or work can proceed of the Lord.",He did then really lay our sin and his curse upon him for our sin.,Objection Second.,"But if Christ indeed hath suffered for our sins, and endured for them that curse that of justice is due thereto, then hath he also endured for us the proper torments of hell, for they are the wages of our sins.",Answer.,Many things might be said in answer to this objection; but briefly--First.,"What God chargeth upon the soul for sin is one thing, and what followeth upon that charge is another.",Second.,A difference in the person suffering may make a difference in the consequences that follow upon the charge.,Let us then consider of both these things.,First.,The charge is sin--God charge him with our sins.,The person then stands guilty before the judgment of God.,The consequences are--1.,The person charged sustains or suffereth the wrath of God.,2.,This wrath of God is expressed and inflicted on body and soul.,"The consequences are--God forsaketh the person charged, and being left, if he cannot stand, he falleth under the power of guilt and horror of the same.","If the person utterly fall under this charge, as not being able to wrestle with and overcome this wrath of God, then despair, horror of hell, rage, blasphemy, darkness, and damnable anguish, immediately swallow him up, and he lieth for ever and ever in the pains of hell, a monument of eternal vengeance.","Now that Christ underwent the wrath of God it is evident, because he bare our curse; that God forsook him, he did with strong crying and tears acknowledge; and therefore that he was under the soul-afflicting sense of the loss of God's favour, and under the sense of his displeasure, must needs flow from the premises.",[Second.],"But now, because Christ Jesus the Lord was a person infinitely differing from all others that fall under the wrath of God, therefore those things that flow from damned sinners could not flow from him.",1.,"Despair would not rise in his heart, for his flesh did rest in hope; and said, even when he suffered, 'Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell' (Acts 2:27).",2.,"The everlastingness of the punishment, therefore, nor the terrors that accompany such, could not fasten upon him; for he knew at last that God would justify him, or approve of his works that they were meritorious.","And mark, everlasting punishment is not the proper wages of sin but under a supposition that the person suffering be not able to pay the debt--'Thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite' (Luke 12:59).","The difference, then, of the persons suffering may make a difference, though not in the nature of the punishment, yet in the duration and consequences of it.","Christ under the sentence was, as to his own personal acts only, altogether innocent; the damned only altogether sinners.","Christ had in him even then the utmost perfection of all graces and virtues; but the damned, the perfection of sin and vileness.","Christ's humanity had still union with his Godhead; the damned, union only with sin.","Now, an innocent person, perfect in all graces, as really God as man, can better wrestle with the curse for sin than either sinful men or angels.","While they despair, Christ hopes.","While they blaspheme, Christ submits.","While they rage, Christ justifies God.","While they sink under the burden of sin and wrath, Christ recovereth by virtue of his worthiness--'Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.'","He was God's Holy One, and his holiness prevailed.","So that it follows not, that because Christ did undergo the curse due to our sins, he therefore must have those accidental consequences which are found to accompany damned souls.",Objection Third.,"But the Scripture saith, that the wages of sin is everlasting punishment: 'Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels' (Matt 25:41).",Answer.,This objection is partly answered already in the answer to that foregoing.,"But further, First.","Consider, the wages of sin is death, and punishment under the wrath of God--till those that die the death for sin have paid the utmost farthing (Matt 5:26; Luke 12:58,59).",Second.,"So, then, the everlastingness of the punishment lieth here, if the person suffering be not able to make amends to justice for the sins for which he suffereth; else justice neither would nor could, because it is just, keep such still under punishment.",Third.,"The reason, then, why fallen angels and damned souls have an everlastingness of punishment allotted them is, because, by what they suffer, they cannot satisfy the justice of God.",Fourth.,"The conclusion then is, though the rebukes of God for sin by death, and punishment after, be the rebukes of eternal vengeance, yet the eternity of that punishment is for want of merit.","Could the damned merit their own deliverance, justice would let them go.",Fifth.,"It is one thing, therefore, to suffer for sin by the stroke of eternal justice, and another thing to abide for ever a sufferer there: Christ did the first, the damned do the second.",Sixth.,"His rising, therefore, from the dead the third day doth nothing invalidate his sufferings, but rather showeth the power of his merit.","And here I would ask a question, Had Christ Jesus been more the object of faith, if weakness and endless infirmity had kept him under the curse, than by rising again from the dead; want of merit causing the one, sufficiency thereof causing the other?",Seventh.,"If men will not believe that Christ hath removed the curse because he is risen again, they would much more strongly have doubted it had he been still in the grave.","But, O amazing darkness!","to make that an argument that his sufferings wanted merit, which to God himself is sufficient proof that he hath purged our sins for ever--'For this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God' (Heb 10:12).",Objection Fourth.,"But the Scripture saith, Christ is our example, and that in his very death (1 Peter 2:21).",Answer.,Christ in his sufferings and death is both sacrifice and example.,First.,A sacrifice--'Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.',"And again, 'He gave himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God, for a sweet-smelling savour.'","And thus he made reconciliation for iniquity, and brought in everlasting righteousness (1 Cor 5:7; Eph 5:1,2; Dan 9:24).",Second.,"He was also in his sufferings exemplary, and that in several particulars--(1.)",In his meek deportment while he was apprehended (Isa 53:7).,(2.),"In doing them good that sought his life (Luke 22:50,51).",(3.),In his praying for his enemies when they were in their outrage (Luke 23:34).,(4.),"'When he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously' (1 Peter 2:23).","In these respects, I say, he was exemplary, and brought honour to his profession by his good behaviour; and O how beautiful would Christianity be in the eyes of men, if the disciples of our Lord would more imitate him therein!",But what?,"because Christ is our pattern, is he not our passover?","or, because we should in these things follow his steps, died he not for our sins?","Thus to conclude would not only argue thee very erroneous, but such a conclusion would overthrow the gospel, it being none other but a great sleight of Satan to shut out the whole by a part, and to make us blasphemers while we plead for holiness.","Look, then, upon the death of Christ under a double consideration--1.",As he suffered from the hand of God.,2.,As he suffered from the hand of men.,"Now, as he suffered by God's hand, so he suffered for sin; but as he suffered from men, so he suffered for righteousness' sake.","Observe, then, that as he suffered for sin, so no man took away his life; but as he suffered for righteousness, so they slew him by wicked hands.",What is it then?,"Christ must needs have suffered, and the wisdom of God had so ordained that 'those things which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled' (Acts 3:18).","Thus, therefore, we ought to distinguish of the causes and ends of the death of Christ.","Again; as Christ suffered for sin, so he would neither be taken at man's pleasure, nor die at man's time.",1.,"Not at man's pleasure; and hence it was that they so often sought his life in vain, 'for his hour was not yet come'--to wit, the hour in which he was to be made a sacrifice for our sin (John 13, 17:1,2, 18:1,2).",2.,"Not at their time; but, contrary to all expectation, when the due time was come, 'he bowed his head and gave up the ghost' (John 19:30).","And for this last work, he had power given him of God--that is, power to die when he would.","'I have power,' said he, 'to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again.'",This power never man had before.,"This made the centurion wonder, and made Pontius Pilate marvel; and indeed well they might, for it was as great a miracle as any he wrought in his life; it demonstrated him to be the Son of God (Mark 15:38,39).","The centurion, knowing that according to nature he might have lived longer, concluded therefore that his dying at that instant was not but miraculously.","And when he 'saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.'","And the reason why he had power to die was, that he might offer his offering willingly, and at the season.",1.,"Willingly--'If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord' (Lev 1:3).",2.,"He must offer it at the season--'Thou shalt keep this ordinance,' the passover, 'in his season' (Exo 13:10).","Now, both these offerings having immediate respect to the offering of the body of Christ for sin--for he came in the room of all burnt sacrifices--the passover also was a type of him (Heb 10:3-6; 1 Cor 5:7,8).","Therefore, he being now the priest as well as sacrifice, must have power and will to offer his sacrifice with acceptation; and this the Scripture testifieth he did, where it saith, 'In due time Christ died for the ungodly' (Rom 5:6).","In due time, that is, at the time appointed, at the acceptable time.","Thou must, therefore, unless thou art willing to be deceived, look upon the sufferings of Christ under a double consideration, and distinguish between his sufferings as our example and his suffering for our sins.","And know, that as he suffered as our example, so he suffered only for righteousness' sake from the hands of wicked men; but as he suffered for our sins, so he suffered, as being by God imputed wicked, the punishment that was due to sin, even the dreadful curse of God.","Not that Christ died two deaths, one after another; but he died at the same time upon a double account--for his righteousness' sake from men, for our sins from the hand of God.","And, as I said before, had he only suffered for righteousness' sake, death had not so amazed him, nor had he been so exceeding heavy in the thoughts of it; that had never put him into an agony, nor made him sweat as it were great drops of blood.","Besides, when men suffer only for righteousness' sake, God doth not use to hide his face from them, to forsake them, and make them accursed; 'but Christ hath delivered us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.'",Objection Fifth.,"But if indeed Christ hath paid the full price for us by his death, in suffering the punishment that we should have done, wherefore is the Scripture so silent as not to declare that by his death he hath made satisfaction?",Answer.,"No man may teach God knowledge; he knoweth best how to deliver his mind in such words and terms as best agree with his eternal wisdom, and the consciences of those that are truly desirous of salvation, being overburdened with the guilt of sin.","Perhaps the word 'satisfaction' will hardly be found in the Bible; and where is it said in so many words, 'God is dissatisfied with our sins?'","yet it is sufficiently manifest that there is nothing that God hateth but sin, and sinners for the sake of sin.","What meant he by turning Adam out of paradise, by drowning the old world, by burning up Sodom with fire and brimstone from heaven?","What meant he by drowning of Pharaoh, by causing the ground to swallow up Korah and his company, and by his destroying Israel in the wilderness, if not to show that he was dissatisfied with sin?","That God is also satisfied, yea, more than satisfied, by Christ's sufferings for our sins, is apparent; for, granting that he died for them as these scriptures declare--Isaiah 49:4-6, 53; 1 Corinthians 5:8, 15:1-4; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Galatians 1:4, 3:13; 1 Peter 2:24, 3:18; 1 John 2:2, 3:16, 4:14; Revelation 1:5, 5:9.-- First.","It is apparent, because it is said that God smelled in that offering of the body of Christ for our sins a sweet-smelling savour--'He gave himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God, for a sweet-smelling savour' (Eph 5:2).",Second.,"It is apparent, because it is said expressly that God for Christ's sake doth now forgive--'Be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you' (Eph 4:32).",Third.,"It is apparent that God is satisfied with Christ's blood for our sins, because he hath declared that he can justify those that believe in, or rely upon, that blood for life, in a way of justice and righteousness--'Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus' (Rom 3:24-26).","Now, I say, to object against such plain testimonies, what is it but to deny that Christ died for sin; or to conclude, that having so done, he is still in the grave; or, that there is no such thing as sin; or, no such thing as revenging justice in God against it; or, that we must die ourselves for our sins; or, that sin may be pardoned without a satisfaction; or, that every man may merit his own salvation?",But 'without shedding of blood is no remission' (Heb 9:22).,"To avoid, therefore, these cursed absurdities, it must be granted that Jesus Christ by his death did make satisfaction for sin.","But the word 'satisfaction' may not be used by the Holy Ghost, perhaps for that it is too short and scanty a word to express the blessedness that comes to sinners by the blood of Christ.",1.,To make satisfaction amounts to no more than completely to answer a legal demand for harms and injuries done.,"Now this, when done to the full, leaveth the offender there where he was before he committed the injury.","Now, if Christ had done no more than this, he had only paid our debt, but had not obtained eternal redemption for us.",2.,"For a full satisfaction given by this man for harms done by another may neither obtain the love of the person offended, nor the smallest gift which the person offending hath not deserved.","Suppose I owe to this man ten thousand talents, and another should pay him every farthing, there remaineth over and above by that complete satisfaction not one single halfpenny for me.",Christ hath therefore done more than to make satisfaction for sin by his blood.,"He hath also 'made us kings and priests unto God and his Father,' and we 'shall reign with him for ever and ever' (Rev 1:6, 22:5).",[Additional scriptures in proof of this doctrine.],But take a few more scriptures for the proof of the doctrine before asserted.,First.,'We have redemption through his blood' (Col 1:14).,1.,Redemption from sin (Eph 1:7).,2.,"Redemption from death (Heb 2:14,15;

for there can be no change in justice.","Had he found him in our sins in the grave, as he found him in them upon the tree (for he had them in his body on the tree), he had left him there as he had left him upon the tree; yea, he had as surely rotted in the grave, as ever he died on the tree (1 Peter 2:24).","But when he visited Christ in the grave, he found him a holy, harmless, undefiled, and spotless Christ, and therefore he raised him up from the dead--'He raised him up from the dead, having loosed the pains of death; because it was not possible that he should be holden of it' (Acts 2:24).",Quest.,But why not possible now to be holden of death?,Answ.,Because the cause was removed.,Sin was the cause--'He died for our sins.--He gave himself for our sins' (1 Cor 15:1-3; Gal 1:4).,"These sins brought him to death; but when God, that had made him a curse for us, looked upon him in the grave, he found him there without sin, and therefore loosed the pains of death; for justice saith, this is not possible, because not lawful, that he who lieth sinless before God should be swallowed up of death; therefore he raised him up.",Quest.,"But what did he do with our sins, for he had them upon his back?",Answ.,It is said he took them away--'Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.',It is said he put them away--'Now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself' (John 1:29; Heb 9:26).,"That is, by the merit of his undertaking he brought into the world, and set before the face of God, such a righteousness that outweigheth and goeth far beyond that sin, and so did hide sin from the sight of God; hence, he that is justified is said to have his sins hid and covered--'Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered' (Psa 32:1).","Covered with the righteousness of Christ--'I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness,' thy sins (Eze 16:8).","Christ Jesus, therefore, having by the infiniteness of his merit taken away, put away, or hidden our sins from the face of God, therefore he raised him up from the dead.","You find in that sixteenth of Leviticus mention made of two goats, one was to be slain for a sin-offering, the other to be left alive; the goat that was slain was a type of Christ in his death, the goat that was not slain was a type of Christ in his merit.","Now this living goat, he carried away the sins of the people into the land of forgetfulness--'And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hands of a fit man into the wilderness; and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited' (Lev 16:21,22).","Thus did Jesus Christ bear away by the merit of his death the sins and iniquities of them that believe; wherefore, when God came to him in the grave, he found him holy and undefiled, and raised him up from the dead.","And observe it, as his death was for our sin, so his rising again was for our discharge; for both in his death and resurrection he immediately respected our benefits; he died for us, he rose from the dead for us--'He was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification' (Rom 4:25).","By his death he carried away our sins, by his rising he brought to us justifying righteousness.",There are five circumstances also attending his resurrection that show us how well pleased God was with his death.,First.,"It must be solemnized with the company, attendance, and testimony of angels (Matt 28:1-8; Luke 24:3-7; John 20:11,12).",Second.,"At, or just upon, his resurrection, the graves where many of the saints for whom he died lay asleep, did open, and they followed their Lord in full triumph over death--'The graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many' (Matt 27:52,53).","These saints coming out of their graves after him, what a testimony is it that he for them had taken away sin, and destroyed him that had the power of death; yea, what a testimony was it that he had made amends to God the Father, who granted him at his resurrection to have presently out of the grave, of the price of his blood, even the bodies of many of the saints which slept!","He was declared to be the Son of God with power by the Spirit of holiness, and the resurrection from the dead (Rom 1:4).","It saith not, by his resurrection, though that be true; but by the resurrection, meaning the resurrection of the bodies of the saints which slept, because they rose by virtue of his blood; and by that he was with power declared to be the Son of God.","They, I say, were part of his purchase, some of them for whom Christ died.","Now for God to raise them, and that upon and by virtue of his resurrection, what is it but an open declaration from heaven that Christ by his death hath made amends for us, and obtained eternal redemption for us?",Third.,"When he was risen from the dead, God, to confirm his disciples in the faith of the redemption that Christ had obtained by his blood, brings him to the church, presents him to them alive, shows him openly, sometimes to two or three, sometimes to eleven or twelve, and once to above five hundred brethren at once (Acts 1:3, 10:40; Luke 24:13-16; John 20:19, 21:1-23; 1 Cor 15:3-8).",Fourth.,"At his resurrection, God gives him the keys of hell and of death (Rev 1:18).",Hell and death are the effects and fruits of sin.,"'The wicked shall be turned into hell,' and the wages of sin is death.",But what then are sinners the better for the death and blood of Christ?,O!,"they that dare venture upon him are much the better, for they shall not perish, unless the Saviour will damn them, for he hath the keys of hell and of death.","'Fear not,' saith he, 'I am the first and the last, I am he that liveth, and was dead, and, behold, I am alive for evermore, and have the keys of hell and death.'","These were given him at his resurrection, as if God had said, My Son, thou hast spilt thy blood for sinners, I am pleased with it, I am delighted in thy merits, and in the redemption which thou hast wrought; in token hereof I give thee the keys of hell and of death; I give thee all power in heaven and earth; save who thou wilt, deliver who thou wilt, bring to heaven who thou wilt.",Fifth.,"At Christ's resurrection, God bids him ask the heathen of him, with a promise to give him the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession.","This sentence is in the second Psalm, and is expounded by Paul's interpretation of the words before, to be spoken to Christ at his resurrection--'Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.'","I have begotten thee--that is, saith Paul, from the dead (Acts 13:33,34).","He hath raised up Jesus again, as it is also written in the second Psalm--'Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.'","Now mark, at his raising him from the dead, he bids him ask, 'Ask of me,' and that 'the heathen'; as if God had said, My Son, thy blood hath pacified and appeased my justice; I can now in justice, for thy sake, forgive poor mortals their sin.","Ask them of me; ask them, though they be heathens, and I will give them to thee, to the utmost ends of the earth.","This is, then, the first demonstration to prove that Jesus Christ, by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for the souls of sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them--namely, his being raised again from the dead.",THE SECOND DEMONSTRATION.,SECOND.,"A second thing that demonstrateth this truth is, that he ascended and was received up into heaven.","'So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven' (Mark 16:19).","This demonstration consisteth of two parts--First, Of his ascending.","Second, Of his being received.",First.,For his ascending--'He ascended up on high' (Eph 4:8).,"This act of ascending answereth to the high-priest under the law, who, after they had killed the sacrifice, he was to bring the blood into the most holy place--to wit, the inner temple, the way to which was ascending or going up (2 Chron 9).","Now, consider the circumstances that attended his ascending, when he went to carry his blood to present it before the mercy-seat, and you will find they all say amends is made to God for us.",1.,"At this he is again attended and accompanied with angels (Acts 1:10,11).",2.,"He ascendeth with a shout, and with the sound of a trumpet, with 'Sing praises, sing praises, sing praises' (Psa 47:6).",3.,"The enemies of man's salvation are now tied to his chariot-wheels--'When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive' (Eph 4:8).","That is, he led death, devils, and hell, and the grave, and the curse, captive, for these things were our captivity.","And thus did Deborah prophesy of him when she cried, 'Arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam' (Judg 5:12).","This David also foresaw when he said, 'Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive' (Psa 68:18).",4.,"The apostles must be the beholders of his going up, and must see the cloud receive him out of their sight (Acts 1:9-12).","The consideration of these things strongly enforceth this conclusion, that he hath spoiled what would have spoiled us, had he not by his blood shed taken them away.","And I say, for God to adorn him with all this glory in his ascension, thus to make him ride conqueror up into the clouds, thus to go up with sound of trumpet, with shout of angels, and with songs of praises, and, let me add, to be accompanied also with those that rose from the dead after his resurrection, who were the very price of his blood; this doth greatly demonstrate that Jesus Christ, by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for the souls of sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them; he had not else rode thus in triumph to heaven.",Second.,I come now to his being received--'He was received up into heaven.',"The high-priest under the law, when he ascended into the holiest, he was there to offer the blood, which holiest was the type of heaven (Exo 19:10,11; Heb 9:24).","But because the sacrifices under the law could not make them that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience, therefore they were to stand, not to sit; to come out again, not tarry there.",'For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.,"Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.","Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me), to do thy will, O God' (Heb 10:4-6).","Christ, therefore, in his entering into heaven, did it as high-priest of the church of God; therefore neither did he go in without blood.","Wherefore, when he came to be 'an high-priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood; he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us' (Heb 9:12-14).","He entered in, having obtained, or because he obtained, eternal redemption for us.",But to pass that.,[Glorious circumstances attending his entrance into heaven.],Consider ye now also those glorious circumstances that accompany his approach to the gates of the everlasting habitation.,First.,"The everlasting gates are set, yea, bid stand open--Be ye open, 'ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.'","This King of glory is Jesus Christ, and the words are a prophecy of his glorious ascending into the heavens, when he went up as the high-priest of the church, to carry the price of his blood into the holiest of all.","'Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in' (Psa 24:7,9).",Second.,"At his entrance he was received, and the price accepted which he paid for our souls.","Hence it is said, he entered in by his blood--that is, by the merit of it.","'To receive' is an act of complacency and delight, and includeth well-pleasedness in the person receiving, who is God the Father; and considering that this Jesus now received is to be received upon our account, or as undertaking the salvation of sinners--for he entered into the heavens for us--it is apparent that he entered thither by virtue of his infinite righteousness, which he accomplished for us upon the earth.",Third.,"At his reception he received glory, and that also for our encouragement--'God raised him up, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God' (1 Peter 1:19-21).","He gave him glory, as a testimony that his undertaking the work of our redemption was accepted of him.",1.,"He gave glory to his person, in granting him to sit at his own right hand; and this he had, I say, for or upon the account of the work he accomplished for us in the world.","When he had offered up one sacrifice for sins for ever, he sat down on the right hand of God, and this by God's appointment--'Sit thou at my right hand' (Heb 10:12,13).","This glory is the highest; it is above all kings, princes, and potentates in this world; it is above all angels, principalities, and powers in heaven.","'He is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him' (1 Peter 3:32).",2.,"He gave glory to his name, to his name Jesus, that name being exalted above every name--'He hath given him a name above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father' (Phil 2:9-11).","This name is said, in another place, to be a name above every name that is named, 'not only in this world, but also in that which is to come' (Eph 1:21).","But should JESUS have been such a name, since he undertook for sinners, had this undertaker failed in his work, if his work had not been accepted with God, even the work of our redemption by his blood?","No, verily; it would have stunk in the nostrils both of God and man; it would have been the most abhorred name.","But Jesus is the name; Jesus he was called, in order to his work--'His name shall be called JESUS, for he shall save'; he was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb; and he goeth by that name now he is in heaven; by the name Jesus--'Jesus of Nazareth,' because he once dwelt there.","This name, I say, is the highest name, the everlasting name, the name that he is to go by, to be known by, to be worshipped by, and to be glorified by; yea, the name by which also most glory shall redound to God the Father.","Now, what is the signification of this name but SAVIOUR?","This name he hath, therefore, for his work's sake; and because God delighted in his undertaking, and was pleased with the price he had paid for us, therefore the Divine Majesty hath given him it, hath made it high, and hath commanded all angels to bow unto it; yea, it is the name in which he resteth, and by which he hath magnified all his attributes.",(1.),This is the name by which sinners should go to God the Father.,(2.),"This is the name through which they obtain forgiveness of sins, and 'anything'--'If ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do it' (John 14:14).",(3.),"This is the name through which our spiritual services and sacrifices are accepted, and by which an answer of peace is returned into our bosoms (1 Peter 2).",But more of this anon.,(4.),"At this name devils tremble, at this name angels bow the head, at this name God's heart openeth, at this name the godly man's heart is comforted; this name, none but devils hate it, and none but those that must be damned despise it.","'No man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed,' or accounteth him still dead, and his blood ineffectual to save the world.",3.,He hath also given him the glory of office.,(1.),"He is there a priest for ever, intercepting betwixt the Divine presence and all that hate us, by his blood; sin, Satan, death, hell, the law, the grave, or the like, cannot be heard, if his blood be presented to God as the atonement for us.","This is called the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than the blood of Abel (Heb 12:24).","By this blood he entered into heaven, by this blood he secureth from wrath 'all that come unto God by him.'","But should his blood have had a voice in heaven to save withal, had it not merited first, even in the shedding of it, the ransom and redemption of souls?","It is true, a man whose blood cannot save, may, with Abel's, cry out for vengeance and wrath on the head of him that shed it.","But this blood speaks for better things, this blood speaks for souls, for sinners, for pardon, 'having obtained eternal redemption for us.'",(2.),"He is there a forerunner for us--'Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus' (Heb 6:20).","This office of harbinger is distinct from, though it comes by virtue of, his priestly office; therefore they are both mentioned in the text--'Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high-priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.'","He is therefore our forerunner by virtue of his priesthood, his blood giving worth to all he does.","In this office of harbinger or forerunner, he prepareth for believers their dwelling-places in the heavens; their dwelling-places according to their place, state, calling, service, or work, in his body, the church--'In my Father's house,' saith he, 'are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you.",I go to prepare a place for you' (John 14:2).,"This is that mentioned in the forty-seventh Psalm--'He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob, whom he loved.'","But should he have had power to choose our inheritance for us, to prepare for us our dwelling-places; should he have power to give even heaven itself to a company of poor men, had he not in the first place obtained by his blood the deliverance of our souls from death?",(3.),"He is there a prophet for us, by which office of his he hath received to communicate the whole will of the eternal God, so far as is fit for us to know in this world, or in that which is to come.","Hence he is called the prophet of the church--'The Lord shall raise you up a prophet,' 'and this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.'","But this office he hath also now in heaven, by virtue of the blood he shed for us upon earth.","Hence the new testament is called, 'the new testament in his blood'; and his blood is said to be 'the blood of the everlasting covenant' or testament; yea, such virtue doth his blood give to the new testament, or covenant of grace, as that severed from that it is nothing worth; 'for a testament is of force after men are dead; otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth' (Heb 9:17).","So that every word of God which he hath by Christ given to us for our everlasting consolation, is dipped in blood, is founded in blood, and stands good to sinners purely--I mean with respect to merit--upon the account of blood, or because his blood that was shed for us on the cross prevailed for us for the remission of our sins.","Let not man think to receive any benefit by Christ's prophetical office, by any of the good words of grace, and forgiveness of sins that are sprinkled up and down in the new testament; that looketh not for that good to come to him for the sake of that blood by which this testament is established; for 'neither was the first testament dedicated without blood; for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you' (Heb 9:18-20).","The prophetical office of Christ standeth of two parts--first, in promises of grace: secondly, in directions of worship.","But neither is this last--to wit, the doctrine of worship, or our subjection to that worship--of any value any further than as sprinkled also with his blood; for as in the first testament, the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry were sprinkled with blood, and it was necessary that so it should be, so the heavenly things themselves must be also purified with sacrifices, but yet 'with better sacrifices than these'; for now, not Moses, but Christ, doth sprinkle, not with blood of calves, but with his own blood; neither as entered into places made with hands, but from heaven doth Jesus sprinkle all that doctrine of worship, and subjection of his saints thereto, which is of his own instituting and commanding (Heb 9:23-26).",(4.),"He hath received there the office of a king, by which he ruleth in the church, and over all things for her sake.",'The government shall be upon his shoulder'; the Lord God hath given him the throne of his father David.,"Hence it is that he saith, 'All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth'; but now this kingly office, he hath it by his blood, because he humbled himself to death, therefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him the highest name.","And hence, again, he is called a Lamb upon the throne--'In the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns'; a demonstration of kingly power.","But mark, he was a Lamb upon the throne, he had his horns as a lamb.","Now by 'Lamb' we are to understand, not only his meek and sweet disposition, but his sacrifice; for he was as a lamb to be slain and sacrificed; and so his having a throne and seven horns, as a lamb, giveth us to understand that he obtained this dignity of king by his blood (Rev 5).","'When he had by himself purged our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high' (Heb 1:3).","When 'he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, he sat down on the right hand of God' (Heb 10:12).","Now, put all these together--to wit, his resurrection from the dead, his ascension, and exaltation to office; and remember also that the person thus exalted is the same Jesus of Nazareth that sometime was made accursed of God for sin, and also that he obtained this glory by virtue of the blood that was shed for us, and it must unavoidably follow that Jesus Christ, by what he hath done, hath paid a full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them.",THE THIRD DEMONSTRATION.,THIRD.,But to proceed.,"A third demonstration that Jesus Christ, by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them, is, because he hath received for them the Holy Spirit of God.","'This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof,' said Peter, 'we all are witnesses.","Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear' (Acts 2:32,33).","The receiving of the Holy Ghost at the hand of the Father, who had bruised him before for the transgressions of his people; the receiving of it, I say, upon his resurrection, and that to give them for whom, just before, he had spilt his blood to make an atonement for their souls, argueth that the Divine Majesty found rest and content in that precious blood, and found it full price for the sinners for whom he shed it.","And if you consider the necessity of the giving of this good Spirit to men, and the benefit that they receive by his coming upon them, you will see yet more into the truth now contended for.","First, then, Of the necessity of giving this good Spirit; and then, Second, Of the benefit which we receive at his coming.",First.,Of the necessity of its being given.,1.,"Otherwise, Jesus could never have been proved to be the Saviour; for the promise was, that Messias should have the Spirit given him; given him to communicate--'As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth,' meaning the Redeemer, 'shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever' (Isa 59:20,21).","Here is the promise of the Spirit to be given to Christ, and by him to his seed for ever.","And this was signified long before in the anointing of Aaron and his sons--'And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them' (Exo 30:30).","This Spirit Jesus promised to send unto his at his exaltation on the right hand of God; the Spirit, I say, in the plentiful pourings of it out.","True, the church in all ages had something of it by virtue of the suretyship of the Lord Jesus; but this, in comparison of what was to come into the church after his resurrection, is not reckoned a pouring forth; therefore pourings forth are reserved to the time of the ascension and exaltation of this Jesus.",'I will pour out of my Spirit in those days.',"Hence Jesus reserves it till his going away, and it is expressly said, 'The Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.'","Accordingly did the apostles wait after his resurrection for the pouring forth of the Holy Ghost, and at the set time did receive it; by the giving of which he declared himself to be the Son of God and Saviour of the world (John 7:39, 14:26, 15:26, 16:7; Acts 1:4,5, 2:16,17; Joel 2:28; Rom 1:4).",2.,"Without the giving of the Holy Ghost, there had wanted a testimony that his gospel was the gospel of Messias.","Moses' ministration was confirmed by signs and wonders and mighty deeds, both in Egypt, in the wilderness, and at the Red Sea; wherefore it was necessary that the doctrine of redemption by blood, which is the doctrine of the gospel of this Jesus, should be also 'confirmed with signs following.'","Hence both himself and apostles did as frequently work miracles and do mighty deeds as his ministers now do preach; which signs and miracles and wonders confirmed their doctrine, though themselves, both master and scholar, were in appearance the most considerable mean [in outward show the meanest of men]; yea, they by the means of the Holy Ghost have so ratified, confirmed, and settled the gospel in the world, that no philosopher, tyrant, or devil, hath been able hitherto to move it out of its place.",He confirmed 'the word with signs following' (Mark 16:20; Heb 2:4).,3.,"As the giving of the Holy Ghost was necessary thus, so was it necessary also to strengthen them that were intrusted with the gospel, (1.)",To preach it effectually; (2.),To stand to it boldly; and (3.),To justify it to be the doctrine of Messias incontrollably.,(1.),"To preach it effectually, in demonstration of the Spirit (1 Cor 2:4; John 16:8,9; Acts 8:13).",(2.),"To stand to it boldly--'Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said.'","'And they saw the boldness of Peter and John' (2 Cor 6:4-6; Acts 4:8,13).",(3.),To justify the doctrine incontrollably--'I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist' (Luke 21:15).,'And they were not able to resist the wisdom and spirit by which he spake' (Acts 6:10).,"Now I say, that God should give the Holy Ghost to Jesus to confirm this gospel, redemption from sin by his blood, what is it but that by his blood he hath paid full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them?",[Second.],"But again; the benefit which we receive at the coming of the Holy Ghost doth more demonstrate this truth; hath Christ purchased sinners, and are they the price of his blood?",Yes.,But how doth that appear?,"Why, because by the Holy Ghost which he hath received to give us, we are fitted for the inheritance which by his blood is prepared for us.",1.,"By the Spirit of God we are quickened and raised from a state of sin, but that we could not be were it not that an atonement is made for us first, by the blood of Christ our Saviour.","This is true; for they that are quickened by the Holy Ghost are quickened by it through the word of the gospel, which offereth justification to sinners through faith in his blood; yea, we are said to be quickened together with him, dead and risen with him, yet so as by the Spirit of God.",2.,"We are not only quickened by the Holy Ghost, but possessed therewith; it is given to dwell in our hearts--'Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts' (Gal 4:6).","Which Spirit is also our earnest for heaven, until the redemption of the purchased possession--that is, until our body, which is the purchased possession, be redeemed also out of the grave by the power of the same mighty Spirit of God (Eph 1:13,14).",3.,By this Holy Spirit we are made to believe (Rom 15:13).,4.,By this Holy Spirit we are helped to pray and call God Father.,5.,By this Holy Spirit we are helped to understand and apply the promises.,6.,By this Holy Spirit the joy of heaven and the love of God is shed abroad in the heart of the saved.,7.,"By this Holy Spirit we are made to wait for the hope of righteousness by faith; that is, to stand fast through our Lord Jesus in the day when he shall judge the world.","And all this is the fruit of redemption by blood, of redemption by the blood of Christ.","This is yet further evident, (1.)","Because the work of the Spirit is to lead us into the sayings of Christ, which, as to our redemption from death, are such as these--'I lay down my life, that you may have life'; 'I give my life a ransom for many'; and, 'The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world' (John 6:51).",(2.),"Because the Spirit, in the wisdom of heaven, is not counted a sufficient testimony on earth, but as joined with the blood of Christ--'There are three that bear witness on earth, the Spirit, the water, and the blood'; these are the witnesses of God.","The Spirit, because it quickeneth; the blood, because it hath merited; and the water--to wit, the word--because by that we are clean as to life and conversation (1 John 5:8; Eph 5:26; Rom 8:16; Psa 119:9).",(3.),"Because, as by the Spirit, so we are sanctified by faith in the blood of Jesus (Heb 13:12).",(4.),"Because, when most full of the Spirit, and when that doth work most mightily in us, we are then most in the belief and admiring apprehensions of our deliverance from death by the blood of Jesus (Rev 5:9, 15).",(5.),"The Holy Ghost breatheth nowhere so as in the ministry of this doctrine, this doctrine is sent with the Holy Ghost from heaven; yea, as I have hinted, one of the great works of the Holy Ghost, under the Old Testament, was to testify 'of the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow' (1 Peter 1:11,12).","Put all these things together, and see if Jesus Christ, by what he hath done, hath not paid full price to God for sinners, if he 'hath not obtained eternal redemption for them?'",THE FOURTH DEMONSTRATION.,FOURTH.,"That Jesus Christ, by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them, is evident, if you consider how the preaching thereof hath been, from that time to this, a mighty conqueror over all kinds of sinners.","What nation, what people, what kind of sinners have not been subdued by the preaching of a crucified Christ?","He upon the white horse with his bow and his crown hath conquered, doth conquer, and goeth forth yet 'conquering and to conquer' (Rev 6:2).","'And I,' saith he, 'if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me' (John 12:32).",But what was it to be lifted up from the earth?,"Why, it may be expounded by that saying, 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life' (John 3:14,15).","He was then lifted up when he was hanged upon a tree between the heavens and the earth, as the accursed of God for us.","The revelation of this, it conquers all nations, tongues, and people.","'And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation' (Rev 5:9).","Hence the apostle Paul chose above all doctrines to preach up a crucified Christ, and resolved so to do; 'for I determined,' saith he, 'not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified' (1 Cor 2:2).",First.,"The doctrine of forgiveness of sin conquered his very murderers; they could not withstand the grace; those bloody ones that would kill him, whatever it cost them, could stand no longer, but received his doctrine, fell into his bosom, and obtained the salvation which is in Christ Jesus--'They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born' (Zech 12:10).","Now was this scripture eminently fulfilled, when the kindness of a crucified Christ broke to pieces the hearts of them that had before been his betrayers and murderers.","Now was there a great mourning in Jerusalem; now was there wailing and lamentation, mixed with joy and rejoicing.",Second.,"Though Paul was mad, exceeding mad against Jesus Christ of Nazareth; yea, though he was his avowed enemy, seeking to put out his name from under heaven, yet the voice from heaven, 'I am Jesus,' &c., 'I am the Saviour,' how did it conquer him, make him throw down his arms, fall down at his feet, and accept of the forgiveness of sins freely by grace, through redemption by faith in his blood!",Third.,"They at Samaria (though before Philip preached to them) worshipped and admired the devil in Magus, yet when they believed Philip's preaching of Christ unto them, and forgiveness of sins through faith in his name, great joy was amongst them, and they were baptized, both men and woman (Acts 8).","'He preached,' saith the text, 'the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ'--that is, all the blessings of life, through the name of Jesus Christ; for he is the Mediator, and without his blood come no spiritual blessings to men.",Fourth.,How was the sturdy jailer overcome by a promise of forgiveness of sins by faith in Jesus Christ!,"It stopped his hand of self-murder, it eased him of the gnawings of a guilty conscience and fears of hell-fire, and filled his soul with rejoicing in God (Acts 16:30-34).",Fifth.,"How were those that used curious arts, that were next to, if not witches indeed; I say, how were they prevailed upon and overcome by the word of God, which is the gospel of good tidings, through faith in the blood of Christ!","(Acts 19:17,18).",Sixth.,"How were the Ephesians, who were sometimes far from God; how, I say, were they made nigh by the blood of Christ!",(Eph 2:13).,Seventh.,"The Colossians, though sometimes dead in their sins, yet how were they quickened by God, through the forgiveness of all their trespasses; and they had that through his blood!","(Col 1:14, 2:13).",What shall I say?,"No man could as yet stand before and not fall under the revelation of the forgiveness of sins through a crucified Christ, as hanged, as dying, as accursed for sinners; he draws all men unto him, men of all sorts, of all degrees.","Shall I add, how have men broken through the pricks to Jesus when he hath been discovered to them!","Neither lions, nor fires, nor sword, nor famine, nor nakedness, nor peril, 'neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord' (Rom 8:35-39).",THE FIFTH DEMONSTRATION.,FIFTH.,"That Jesus Christ, by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them, is evident, by the peace and holiness that by that doctrine possesseth men's souls; the souls of men awakened, and that continue so.","By awakened men I mean such as, through the revelation of their sin and misery, groan under the want of Jesus to save them, and that continue sensible that they needs must perish if his benefits be not bestowed upon them; for otherwise the gospel ministereth neither peace nor holiness to any of the souls of the sons of men; that is to say, not saving peace and holiness.","The gospel of grace and salvation is above all doctrines the most dangerous, if in word only it be received by graceless men; if it be not attended with a revelation of men's need of a Saviour; if it be not accompanied in the soul by the power of the Holy Ghost.","For such men as have only the notions of it are of all men liable to the greatest sins, because there wanteth in their notions the power of love, which alone can constrain them to love Jesus Christ.",And this is the reason of these scriptures--They turn the grace of God into wantonness.,'They turn the grace of our God into lasciviousness' (Jude 4).,"For some, when they hear of the riches of grace through Christ, that hearing not being attended with the faith and love which is in Christ Jesus, those men receive the notions of this good doctrine only to cloak their wickedness, and to harden themselves in their villainies.","Others, when they hear, being leavened before with the leaven of some other doctrine, some doctrine of the righteousness of the world, or doctrine of devils, forthwith make head against and speak evil of the blessed doctrine; and because some that profess it are not cleansed from their filthiness of flesh and spirit, and do not perfect holiness in the fear of God, therefore others conclude that all that profess it are such, and that the doctrine itself tendeth to encourage, or at least to tolerate, licentiousness, as they imagined and affirmed of Paul that he should say, 'Let us do evil, that good may come' (Rom 3:8).","The ground of that wicked conclusion of theirs was, because he by the allowance of God affirmed that, as sin had reigned unto death, so grace reigned unto life in a way of righteousness by Jesus Christ our Lord.","Nay, then, says the adversary, we may be as unholy as we will, and that by the doctrine you preach; for if where sin abounds grace abounds more, the consequence of a wicked life is but the heightening, advancing, and magnifying of grace.",But what saith the apostle?,"My conclusions are true that grace doth reign above sin, but to say, 'Let us therefore sin,' that man's damnation is just; because such an one abuseth and maketh the most devilish use of the blessedest doctrine that ever was heard of in the world amongst men.","Besides, it is evident that such know not the power thereof, nor have felt or savoured its blessedness; for where this gospel cometh in truth, it naturally produceth peace and holiness.",First.,Peace.,"He is our peace, he is the Prince of peace, he giveth peace in his high places.",This word 'peace' hath in it a double respect.,1.,"It respecteth God--He hath 'made peace by the blood of his cross'; that is, he hath made peace for us with God, having appeased the rigour of his law, and satisfied justice for us.","Hence it is said, 'The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus' (Col 1:20; Phil 4:7).","'The peace of God'--that is, the doctrine of reconciliation by Christ's being made to be sin for us, THAT shall keep the heart--that is, from despair or fainting, under apprehensions of weakness and justice.","But yet this peace of God cannot be apprehended, nor be of any comfort to the heart, but as the man looks for it through Christ Jesus; therefore that clause is added, 'through Christ Jesus'; for he is peace-maker, it is he that reconcileth us to God 'in the body of his flesh through death'; for by his doing and suffering he presented God with everlasting righteousness, with everlasting righteousness for sinners.",Upon this we have peace with God.,"Hence Christ is called King of righteousness first; 'first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace' (Heb 7:1,2).","For he could not make peace with God betwixt us and him but by being first the Lord of righteousness, the Lord our righteousness; but having first completed righteousness, he then came and preached peace, and commanded his ambassadors to make proclamation of it to the world, for it was want of righteousness that caused want of peace (2 Cor 5:19-21).","Now, then, righteousness being brought in, it followeth that he hath made peace.","'For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: and came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.",For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father' (Eph 2:14-18).,2.,"This word 'peace' respecteth our inward quietness of heart which we obtain by beholding this reconciliation made by Christ with God for us--'Being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ' (Rom 5:1).",'The God of peace fill you with all joy and peace in believing' (Rom 15:13).,This peace is expressed diversely--(1.),"Sometimes it is called 'quietness,' for it calms the soul from those troublous fears of damning because of sin--'And the work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever' (Isa 32:17).",(2.),"Sometimes it is called 'boldness'; for by the blood of Christ a man hath encouragement to approach unto God--'Having, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh' (Heb 10:19,20).",(3.),"It is sometimes called 'confidence'; because by Jesus Christ we have not only encouragement to come to God, but confidence, that if we ask anything according to his will, he not only heareth, but granteth the request which we put up to him (1 John 5:14,15).","'In whom we have boldness and access with confidence, by the faith of Jesus' (Eph 3:12).",(4.),"Sometimes this peace is expressed by 'rest'; because a man having found a sufficient fulness to answer all his wants, he sitteth down, and looks no further for satisfaction--'Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest' (Matt 11:28).",(5.),It is also expressed by 'singing'; because the peace of God when it is received into the soul by faith putteth the conscience into a heavenly and melodious frame.,"'And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away' (Isa 35:10).",(6.),"Sometimes it is expressed or discovered by a heavenly glorying and boasting in Jesus Christ; because this peace causeth the soul to set its face upon its enemies with faith of a victory over them for ever by its Lord Jesus--'Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord' (Jer 9:23,24).","And, 'My soul shall make her boast in the Lord; the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad' (Psa 34:2).",(7.),"Sometimes it is expressed or discovered by joy, 'joy unspeakable': because the soul, having seen itself reconciled to God, hath not only quietness, but such apprehensions do now possess it of the unspeakable benefits it receiveth by Christ with respect to the world to come, that it is swallowed up with them--'Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory' (1 Peter 1:8).",(8.),"Lastly, it is expressed or discovered by the triumph that ariseth sometimes in the hearts of the believers, for they at times are able to see death, sin, the devil, and hell, and all adversity, conquered by, and tied as captives at the chariot-wheels of Jesus Christ; taken captive, I say, and overthrown for ever.",'Thanks be unto God which always causeth us to triumph in Christ' (2 Cor 2:14).,"'O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph' (Psa 47:1).",[The Authors of this peace.],"--Now that all this should be a cheat is impossible--that is, it is impossible that believers should thus have peace with God through the blood of his cross, he having not paid full price to God for them; especially if you consider that the authors of this peace are all the three in the Godhead, and that upon a double account.",1.,In that they have given us a gospel of peace (Rom 10:15).,Or a new testament which propoundeth peace with God through the redemption that is in Christ.,"Now as this is called the gospel of peace, so it is called the gospel of God (1 Thess 2:9).",The gospel of Christ (Rom 15:19; 2 Thess 1:8).,A gospel indited by the Holy Ghost (1 Thess 4:8).,"I say, therefore, that redemption and salvation being that through Christ, and the truth thereof proclaimed by the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, in the word of the truth of the gospel, it must needs be that we who believe shall be saved, 'if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.'",2.,"As the three in the Godhead are the authors of this peace by inditing for us the gospel of peace, or the good tidings of salvation by Jesus Christ, so they are the authors of our peace by working with that word of the gospel in our hearts.","And hence, (1.)","The Father is called the God of peace, 'Now the God of peace be with you all' (Rom 15:33).",'And the very God of peace sanctify you' (1 Thess 5:23).,"And because he is the God of peace, therefore he filleth those that believe in his Christ with joy and peace through believing (Rom 15:13).",(2.),"Again, Christ is called the Prince of peace; therefore the prayer is, 'Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ' (2 Thess 1:2).",(3.),"The Holy Ghost also is the author of this peace, this inward peace, even 'righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost' (Rom 14:17).","And I say, as I also already have said, the procuring or meritorious cause of this peace is the doings and sufferings of Christ; therefore by his doings and sufferings he paid full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them; else God would never have indited a proclamation of peace for them, and the tenor of that proclamation to be the worthiness of the Lord Jesus; yea, he would never have wrought with that word in the heart of them that believe, to create within them peace, peace.",Second.,[Holiness.],"As peace with God is an evidence--the blood of Christ being the cause thereof--that Christ hath by it paid full price to God for sinners, so holiness in their hearts, taking its beginning from this doctrine, makes its fifth demonstration of double strength.",1.,"That holiness, true gospel holiness, possesseth our hearts by this doctrine it is evident, because the ground of holiness, which is the Spirit of God in us, is ministered to us by this doctrine.","When the apostle had insinuated that the Galatians were bewitched because they had turned from the doctrine of Christ crucified, he demands of them whether 'they received the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?'",(Gal 3:1-4).,"That is, whether the Spirit took possession of their souls by their obedience to the ten commandments, or by their giving credit to the doctrine of the forgiveness of their sins by faith in this crucified Christ, strongly concluding, not by the law, but by the hearing or preaching of faith--that is, of the Lord Jesus as crucified, who is the object of faith.",2.,"As this doctrine conveyeth the ground or groundwork, which is the Spirit, so also it worketh in the heart those three graces, faith, hope, love, all which as naturally purify the heart from wickedness as soap and nitre cleanseth the cloth.","He purified 'their hearts by faith,' by faith in Christ's blood.","'And every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as he is pure.'","And also love, you shall see what that doth if you look into the text (Acts 15:9; 1 John 3:3,4; 1 Cor 13).","Now, I say, this faith groundeth itself in the blood of Christ; hope waiteth for the full enjoyments of the purchase of it in another world; and love is begot, and worketh by the love that Christ hath expressed by his death, and by the kindness he presented us with in his heart's blood (Rom 3:24; 1 Cor 15:19; 2 Cor 5:14).","Besides, what arguments so prevailing as such as are purely gospel?",To instance a few--(1.),What stronger than a free forgiveness of sins?,"'A certain man had two debtors, the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty; and when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both; tell me therefore which of them will love him most?'","(Luke 7:41,42,47).",(2.),"What stronger argument to holiness than to see that though forgiveness comes free to us, yet it cost Christ Jesus heart-blood to obtain it for us.","'Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.'","And this love of God in giving his Christ, and of Christ in dying for us, there is no argument stronger to prevail with a sensible and awakened sinner to judge 'he should live to him that died for him, and rose again' (2 Cor 5:15).",(3.),"What stronger argument to holiness than this: 'If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous?'",(1 John 2:1).,"Unsanctified and graceless wretches know not how to use these words of God; the hypocrites also fly in our faces because we thus urge them; but a heart that is possessed with gospel ingenuity, or, to speak more properly, that is possessed with gospel grace, and with divine considerations, cries, If it be thus, O let me never sin against God, 'for the love of Christ constraineth me' (2 Cor 5:14).",(4.),"What greater argument to holiness than to see the holy Scriptures so furnished with promises of grace and salvation by Christ, that a man can hardly cast his eye into the Bible but he espieth one or other of them?","Who would not live in such a house, or be servant to such a prince, who, besides his exceeding in good conditions, hath gold and silver as common in his palace as stones are by the highway side?","'Having, therefore, these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God' (2 Cor 7:1).",(5.),"What greater argument to holiness than to have our performances, though weak and infirm from us, yet accepted of God in Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:4-6).",(6.),"What greater argument to holiness than to have our soul, our body, our life, hid and secured with Christ in God?","'Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry' (Col 3:1-5).",(7.),"What greater argument to holiness than to be made the members of the body, of the flesh, and of the bones of Jesus Christ?","'Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot?",God forbid' (Eph 5:30; 1 Cor 6:15).,"Now all these, and five times as many more, having their foundation in the love, blood, and righteousness of Christ, and operating in the soul by faith, are the great arguments unto that holiness to which is annexed eternal life.","It is worth our observing, that in Acts 26:18, the inheritance belongs 'to them which are sanctified by faith in Jesus Christ'; for all other pretences to holiness, they are but a stolen semblance of that which is true and acceptable, though it is common for even that which is counterfeit to be called by the deluded the true, and to be reckoned to be in them that are utter strangers to faith, and the holiness that comes by faith.","'But whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people' (Exo 30:23).","God knoweth which is holiness that comes by faith in forgiveness of sins, and acceptance with God through Christ; and God knows which is only such feignedly; and accordingly will he deal with sinners in that great day of God Almighty.",THE SIXTH DEMONSTRATION.,SIXTH.,"That Jesus Christ, by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them, is evident, because prayers are accepted of God only upon the account and for the sake of the name of Jesus Christ--'Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you' (John 16:23).","In my name, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, in the name of him that came into the world to save sinners, by dying for them a grievous, bloody death; in his name that hath by himself put away sin, and brought unto God acceptable righteousness for sinners; in his name.","Why in his name, if he be not accepted of God?",why in his name if his undertakings for us are not well-pleasing to God?,"But by these words, 'in my name,' are insinuated that his person and performances, as our undertaker, are accepted by the Father of spirits.","We may not go in our own names, because we are sinners; not in the name of one another, because all are sinners.",But why not in the name of an angel?,"Because they are not those that did undertake for us; or had they, they could not have done our work for us.","'He putteth no trust in his saints, yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight' (Job 4:18, 15:15).","It may further be objected-- Since Jesus Christ is God, equal with the Father, and so hath naturally the same power to give us the Father, why should the Father rather than the Son be the great giver to the sinners of the world?","and why may we not go to Christ in the name of the Father, as well as to the Father in the name of Christ?","I say, how can these things be solved, but by considering that sin and justice put a necessity upon it that thus must our salvation be obtained.","Sin and justice could not reconcile, nor could a means be found out to bring the sinner and a holy God together, but by the intercepting of the Son, who must take upon him to answer justice, and that by taking our sins from before the face of God by bloody sacrifice, not by blood of others, as the high-priests under the law--'For every high-priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices; wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer' (Heb 8:3).","Which offering and sacrifice of his being able to perfect for ever them that are sanctified and set apart for eternal life, therefore the name of the person that offered--even Jesus, made of God a high-priest--is acceptable with God; yea, therefore is he made for ever, by his doing for us, the appeaser of the justice of God, and the reconciler of sinners to him.","Hence it is that HIS name is that which it behoveth us to mention when we come before God, for what God hath determined in his counsels of grace to bestow upon sinners, because for his name's sake he forgiveth them.","'I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake' (1 John 2:12).","'To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name, whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins' (Acts 10:43).","They therefore that would obtain the forgiveness of sins must ask it of God, through the name of Jesus; and he that shall sensibly and unfeignedly do it, he shall receive the forgiveness of them--'Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.'","Hence it is evident that he hath not only paid full price to God for them, but also obtained eternal redemption for them.","And it is observable, the Lord Jesus would have his disciples make a proof of this, and promiseth that if they do, they shall experimentally find it so--'Hitherto,' saith he, 'have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full' (John 16:24).","As who should say, O my disciples, you have heard what I have promised to you, even that my Father shall do for you whatsoever ye shall ask him in my name.","Ask now, therefore, and prove me, if I shall not make my words good: ask, I say, what you need, and see if you do not receive it to the joying of your hearts.","'At that day ye shall ask in my name, and I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you.'","I do not bid you ask in my name as if the Father was yet hard to be reconciled, or unwilling to accept you to mercy; my coming into the world was the design of my Father, and the effect of his love to sinners; but there is sin in you and justice in God; therefore that you to him might be reconciled, I am made of my Father mediator; wherefore ask in my name, for 'there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved' (Acts 4:12).","Ask in my name; love is let out to you through me; it is let out to you by me in a way of justice, which is the only secure way for you.","Ask in my name, and my Father will love you--'The Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God' (John 16:27).","My Father's love is set first upon me, for my name is chief in his heart, and all that love me are beloved of my Father, and shall have what they need, if they ask in my name.","But, I say, what cause would there be to ask in his name more than in the name of some other, since justice was provoked by our sin, if he had not undertook to make up the difference that by sin was made betwixt justice and us?","For though there be in this Jesus infinite worth, infinite righteousness, infinite merit, yet if he make not with these interest for us, we get no more benefit thereby than if there were no mediator.","But this worth and merit is in him for us, for he undertook to reconcile us to God; it is therefore that his name is with God so prevailing for us poor sinners, and therefore that we ought to go to God in his name.","Hence, therefore, it is evident that Jesus Christ hath paid full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them.",THE SEVENTH DEMONSTRATION.,SEVENTH.,"That Jesus Christ, by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for sinners, &c., is evident, because we are commanded also to give God thanks in his name--'By him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name' (Heb 3:15).",'By him therefore.',Wherefore?,"Because he also, that he might 'sanctify us with his own blood, suffered without the gate' (v 12).",He sanctified us with his blood; but why should the Father have thanks for this?,"Even because the Father gave him for us, that he might die to sanctify us with his blood--'Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son; in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins' (Col 1:12-14).","The Father is to be thanked, for the contrivance was also his; but the blood, the righteousness, or that worthiness, for the sake of which we are accepted of God, is the worthiness of his own dear Son.","As it is meet, therefore, that God should have thanks, so it is necessary that he have it in his name for whose sake we indeed are accepted of him.","Let us therefore by him offer praise first for the gift of his Son, and for that we stand quit through him in his sight, and that in despite of all inward weakness, and that in despite of all outward enemies.","When the apostle had taken such a view of himself as to put himself into a maze, with an outcry also, 'Who shall deliver me?'","he quiets himself with this sweet conclusion, 'I thank God through Jesus Christ' (Rom 7:24,25).","He found more in the blood of Christ to save him than he found in his own corruptions to damn him; but that could not be, had he not paid full price for him, had he not obtained eternal redemption for him.","And can a holy and just God require that we give thanks to him in his name, if it was not effectually done for us by him?","Further, when the apostle looks upon death and the grave, and strengtheneth them by adding to them sin and the law, saying, 'The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law,' he presently addeth, 'But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory, through Jesus Christ' (1 Cor 15)--the victory over sin, death, and the law, the victory over these through our Lord Jesus Christ: but God hath given us the victory; but it is through our Lord Jesus Christ, through his fulfilling the law, through his destroying death, and through his bringing in everlasting righteousness.","Elisha said to the king of Israel, that had it not been that he regarded the presence of Jehoshaphat, he would not look to him nor regard him (2 Kings 3:14); nor would God at all have looked to or regarded thee, but that he respected the person of Jesus Christ.","'Let the peace of God [therefore] rule in our hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful' (Col 3:15).","The peace of God, of that we have spoken before.",But how should this rule in our hearts?,"He by the next words directs you--'Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly'--that is, the word that makes revelation of the death and blood of Christ, and of the peace that is made with God for you thereby.","'Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ' (Eph 5:20).","For all things; for all things come to us through this name Jesus--redemption, translation, the kingdom, salvation, with all the good things wherewith we are blessed.","These are the works of God; he gave his Son, and he brings us to him, and puts us into his kingdom--that is, his true body, which Jeremiah calleth a putting among the children, and a 'giving us a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations' (Jer 3:19; John 6).","'Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ' (2 Cor 2:14).","See here our cause of triumph is through Christ Jesus; and God causeth us through him to triumph, first and chiefly, because Christ Jesus hath done our work for us, hath pleased God for our sins, hath spoiled the powers of darkness.","God gave Jesus Christ to undertake our redemption; Christ did undertake it, did engage our enemies, and spoiled them--He 'spoiled principalities and powers, and made a show of them openly, triumphing over them' upon the cross (Col 2:14,15).","Therefore it is evident that he paid full price to God for sinners with his blood, because God commands us to give thanks to him in his name, through his name--'And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him' (Col 3:17).","Take this conclusion from the whole: no thanks are accepted of God that come not to him in the name of his Son; his Son must have the glory of conveying our thanks to God, because he was he that by his blood conveyeth his grace to us.",THE EIGHTH DEMONSTRATION.,EIGHTH.,"In the next place, that Jesus Christ, by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them, is evident, because we are exhorted to wait for, and to expect, the full and glorious enjoyment of that eternal redemption, at the second coming of the Lord from heaven--'Let your loins by girded about, and your lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord,--that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately' (Luke 12:35,36).","Jesus Christ hath obtained by his blood eternal redemption for us, and hath taken it up now in the heavens, is, as I have showed, preparing for us there everlasting mansions of rest; and then he will come again for us.","This coming is intended in this text, and this coming we are exhorted to wait for; and that I may more fully show the truth of this demonstration, observe these following texts-- First.","It is said, he shall choose our inheritance for us--'He shall choose our inheritance for us; the excellency of Jacob whom he loved.",Selah.,"God is gone up with a shout,' &c. (Psa 47:4,5).","These latter words intend the ascension of Jesus Christ; his ascension, when he had upon the cross made reconciliation for iniquity; his ascension into the heavens to prepare our mansions of glory for us; for our inheritance is in the heavens; our house, our hope, our mansion-house, and our incorruptible and undefiled inheritance is in heaven (2 Cor 5:1,2; Col 1:5,6; John 14:1,2; 1 Peter 1:3-5).","This is called the eternal inheritance, of which we that are called have received the promise already (Heb 9:14,15).","This inheritance, I say, he is gone to choose for us in the heavens, because by his blood he obtained it for us (Heb 9:12).","And this we are commanded to wait for; but how ridiculous, yea, how great a cheat would this be, had he not by his blood obtained it for us.",Second.,"'We wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus [Christ], which delivered us from the wrath to come' (1 Thess 1:10).","He delivered us by his blood, and obtained the kingdom of heaven for us, and hath promised that he would go and prepare our places, and come again and fetch us thither--'And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also' (John 14:3).","This, then, is the cause that we wait for him, we look for the reward of the inheritance at his coming who have served the Lord Christ in this world.",Third.,"'For our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ' (Phil 3:20).","We look for him to come yet as a Saviour--a Saviour he was at his first coming, and a Saviour he will be at his second coming.","At his first coming, he bought and paid for us; at his second coming, he will fetch us to himself.","At his first coming, he gave us promise of the kingdom; at his second coming, he will give us possession of the kingdom.","At his first coming, he also showed us how we should be, by his own transfiguration; at his second coming, 'he will change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body' (Phil 3:21).",Fourth.,"Hence therefore it is that his coming is called our blessed hope--'Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ' (Titus 2:13).","A blessed hope indeed, if he hath bought our persons with his blood, and an eternal inheritance for us in the heavens; a blessed hope indeed, if also at his coming we be certainly carried thither.","No marvel, then, if saints be bid to wait for it, and if saints themselves long for it.","But what a disappointment would these waiting believers have, should all their expectations be rewarded with a fable!","and the result of their blessed hope can amount to no more, if our Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ either denieth to come, or coming, bringeth not with him the hope, the blessed hope that is laid up for us in heaven, whereof we have certainly been informed by 'the word of the truth of the gospel' (Col 1:5).",Fifth.,'For Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation' (Heb 9:28).,"Here we have it promised that he shall come, that he shall appear the second time, but not with sin, as he did before--to wit, with and in the sin of his people, when he bare them in his own body; but now without sin, for he before did put them away by the sacrifice of himself.","Now, then, let the saints look for him, not to die for the purchasing of their persons by blood, but to bring to them, and to bring them also to that salvation that before when he died he obtained of God for them by his death.","These things are to be expected therefore by them that believe in and love Jesus Christ, and that from faith and love serve him in this world; they are to be expected by them, being obtained for them by Jesus Christ.","And he shall give the crown, saith Paul, 'not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing' (2 Tim 4:8,9).","Now forasmuch as this inheritance in the heavens is the price, purchase, and reward of his blood, how evidently doth it appear that he hath paid full price to God for sinners!","Would God else have given him the heaven to dispose of to us that believe, and would he else have told us so?","Yea, and what comfort could we have to look for his coming, and kingdom, and glory as the fruits of his death, if his death had not for that purpose been sufficiently efficacious?","O 'the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that shall follow!'",(1 Peter 1:11).,THE NINTH DEMONSTRATION.,NINTH.,"That Jesus Christ, by what he hath done, hath paid full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for sinners, is evident, because of the threatenings wherewith God hath threatened, and the punishments wherewith he punisheth those that shall refuse to be saved by Christ, or seek to make insignificant the doctrine of righteousness by faith in him.",This demonstration consisteth of three parts--First.,"It suggesteth that some refuse to be justified or saved by Christ, and also seek to make insignificant the doctrine of righteousness by faith in him.",Second.,That God doth threaten these.,Third.,That God will punish these.,[First.],That some refuse to be saved by Christ is evident from many texts.,"He is the stone which the builders have rejected; he is also disallowed of men; the Jews stumble at him, and to the Greeks he is foolishness; both saying, This man shall not rule over us, or, How can this man save us?",(Psa 118:22; Matt 21:44; Luke 19:14; 1 Cor 1:23; 1 Peter 2:4).,The causes of men's refusing Christ are many--1.,Their love to sin.,2.,Their ignorance of his excellency.,3.,Their unbelief.,4.,Their deferring to come to him in the acceptable time.,5.,Their leaning to their own righteousness.,6.,Their entertaining damnable doctrines.,7.,Their loving the praise of men.,8.,"The meanness of his ways, his people, &c. 9.",The just judgment of God upon them.,10.,The kingdom is given to others.,"Now these, as they all refuse him, so they seek, more or less, some practically, others in practice and judgment also, to make insignificant the doctrine of righteousness by faith in him.",One does it by preferring his sins before him.,Another does it by preferring his righteousness before him.,Another dies it by preferring his delusions before him.,Another does it by preferring the world before him.,"Now these God threateneth, these God punisheth.",Second.,God threateneth them.,1.,Whosoever shall 'not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from amongst the people' (Acts 3:23).,"The prophet is Jesus Christ; the doctrine that he preached was, that he would lay down his life for us, that he would give us his flesh to eat, and his blood to drink by faith; and promised, that if we did eat his flesh, and drink his blood, we should have eternal life.","He therefore that seeth not, or that is afraid to venture his soul for salvation on the flesh and blood of Christ by faith, he refuseth this prophet, he heareth not this prophet, and him God hath purposed to cut off.","But would God thus have threatened, if Christ by his blood, and the merits of the same, had not paid full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them?",2.,"'Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool' (Psa 110:1; Matt 22:44; Heb 1:13).","The honour of sitting at God's right hand was given him because he died, and offered his body once for all.","'This man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool' (Heb 10:12,13).","Expecting, since God accepted his offering, that those that refused him should be trodden under foot; that is, sunk by him into and under endless and insupportable vengeance.","But would God have given the world such an account of his sufferings, that by one offering he did perfect for ever them that are sanctified?","yea, and would he have threatened to make those foes his footstool that shall refuse to venture themselves upon his offering--for they are indeed his foes--had not his eternal Majesty been well pleased with the price he paid to God for sinners; had he not obtained eternal redemption for them?",3.,"He shall come 'from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ' (2 Thess 1:7,8).","Here he expressly telleth us wherefore they shall be punished; because 'they know not God, and obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ'; where also is notably intimated that he that obeyeth not the gospel of Christ knoweth not God, neither in his justice nor mercy.","But what is the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ but good tidings of good things--to wit, forgiveness of sins by faith in his blood, an inheritance in heaven by faith in his blood, as the whole of all the foregoing discourse hath manifested?","Now, I say, can it be imagined that God would threaten to come upon the world with this flaming, fiery vengeance to punish them for their non-subjection to his Son's gospel, if there had not been by himself paid to God full price for the souls of sinners, if he had not obtained eternal redemption by his blood for sinners?",4.,"'And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him' (Jude 14,15).","The Lord that is here said to come with ten thousands of his saints is Jesus Christ himself; and they that come with him are called his saints, because given to him by the Father, for the sake of the shedding of his blood.","Now in that he is said to come to execute judgment upon all, and especially those that speak hard speeches against him, it is evident that the Father tendereth his name, which is Jesus, a Saviour, and his undertaking for our redemption; and as evident that the hard speeches intended by the text are such as vilify him as Saviour, counting the blood of the covenant unholy, and trampling him that is Prince of the covenant under the feet of their reproachful language; this is counted a putting of him to open shame, and a despising the riches of his goodness (Heb 6:10; Rom 2).","Time would fail to give you a view of the revilings, despiteful sayings, and of the ungodly speeches which these abominable children of hell let fall in their pamphlets, doctrines, and discourses against the Lord the King.","But the threatening is, he shall 'execute judgment upon them for all their ungodly deeds, and for all the hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.'",5.,"'Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets; Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which you shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you' (Acts 13:40,41).","This work is the same we have been all this while treating of--to wit, redemption by the blood of Christ for sinners, or that Christ hath paid full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them.",This is manifest from verses 23 to 29 of this chapter.,"Now, observe, there are and will be despisers of this doctrine, and they are threatened with the wrath of God--'Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish.'","But would God so carefully have cautioned sinners to take heed of despising this blessed doctrine, and have backed his caution with a threatening that they shall perish, if they persist, had not he himself received by the blood of Christ full price for the souls of sinners?",Third.,"As God threateneth, so he punisheth those that refuse his Son, or that seek to vilify or make insignificant the doctrine of righteousness by faith in him.",1.,"He punished them with the abidings of his wrath--'He that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him' (John 3:36).","The wrath of God for men; for sin stands already condemned by the law; and the judgment is, that they who refuse the Lord Jesus Christ shall have this wrath of God for ever lie and abide upon them; for they want a sacrifice to pacify wrath for the sin they have committed, having resisted and refused the sacrifice of the body of Christ.",Therefore it cannot be that they should get from under their present condition who have refused to accept of the undertaking of Christ for them.,"Besides, God, to show that he taketh it ill at the hands of sinners that they should refuse the sacrifice of Christ, hath resolved that there shall be no more sacrifice for sin.","Therefore 'if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins' (Heb 10:26).","God doth neither appoint another, neither will he accept another, whoever brings it.",And here those sayings are of their own natural force: 'How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?',"And again, 'See that ye refuse not him that speaketh.","For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth (Moses), much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him (Christ) that speaketh from heaven' (Heb 2:3, 12:25).","This therefore is a mighty demonstration that Christ by what he hath done hath paid full price to God for the souls of sinners, because God so severely threateneth, and also punisheth them that refuse to be justified by his blood: he threateneth, as you have heard, and punisheth, by leaving such men in their sins, under his heavy and insupportable vengeance here.",2.,"'He that believeth not shall be damned,' damned in hell-fire (Mark 16:16).",'He that believeth not.',But what should he believe?,"Why, (1.)",That Jesus is the Saviour.,"'If,' saith he, 'ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.'",(2.),"He that believeth not that he [Jesus] hath undertaken and completely perfected righteousness for us, shall die in his sins, shall be damned, and perish in hell-fire; for such have no cloak for their sin, but must stand naked to the show of their shame before the judgment of God, that fearful judgment.","Therefore, after he had said, 'there remaineth' for such 'no more sacrifice for sin,' he adds, 'but a certain fearful looking for of judgment'; there is for them left nothing but the judgment of God, and his fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.","'He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace' (Heb 10:28,29).","See here, if fury comes not up now into the face of God; now is mention made of his fearful judgment and fiery indignation.","Now, I say, is mention made thereof, when it is suggested that some have light thoughts of him, count his blood unholy, and trample his sacrificed body under the feet of their reproaches; now is he a consuming fire, and will burn to the lowest hell.","'For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord.","And again, The Lord shall judge his people' (Heb 10:30).","These words are urged by the Holy Ghost on purpose to beget in the hearts of the rebellious reverend thoughts, and a high esteem of the sacrifice which our Lord Jesus offered once for all upon Mount Calvary unto God the Father for our sins; for that is the very argument of the whole epistle.","It is said to this purpose, in one of Paul's epistles to the Thessalonians, that because men receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved; 'for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they might be damned' (2 Thess 2:11,12).",'The truth' mentioned in this place is Jesus Christ.,"'I am the truth,' saith he (John 14:6).",The love of the truth is none else but the love and compassion of Jesus Christ in shedding his blood for man's redemption.,"'Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends' (John 15:13).","This, then, is the love of the Truth (of Jesus), that he hath laid down his life for us.","Now, that the rejecters of this love should by this their rejecting procure such wrath of God against them, that rather than they shall miss of damnation, himself will choose their delusions for them, and also give them up to the effectual working of these delusions, what doth this manifest but that God is displeased with them that accept not of Jesus Christ for righteousness, and will certainly order that their end shall be everlasting damnation?","therefore Jesus Christ hath paid full price to God for sinners, and obtained eternal redemption for them.",THE USE OF THE DOCTRINE.,"I come now to make some use of and to apply this blessed doctrine of the undertaking of Jesus Christ, and of his paying full price to God for sinners, and of his obtaining eternal redemption for them.",THE FIRST USE.,[FIRST.],"By this doctrine we come to understand many things which otherwise abide obscure and utterly unknown, because this doctrine is accompanied with the Holy Ghost, that revealer of secrets, and searcher of the deep things of God (1 Peter 1:2; Eph 1:17; 1 Cor 2).",The Holy Ghost comes down with this doctrine as that in which it alone delighteth; therefore is it called 'the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge' of Jesus Christ.,He giveth also 'the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ' (2 Cor 4:6).,"Little of God is known in the world where the gospel is rejected; the religious Jew and the wise Gentile may see more of God in a crucified Christ than in heaven and earth besides; for in him 'are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,' not only in his person as God, but also in his undertakings as Mediator (Col 2:3).","Hence Paul telleth us, that he 'determined not to know anything among' the Corinthians but 'Jesus Christ and him crucified' (1 Cor 2:2).","I say, more of God is revealed to us in this doctrine than we can see of him in heaven and earth without it.",First.,Here is more of his WISDOM seen than in his making and upholding all the creatures.,"His wisdom, I say, in devising means to reconcile sinners to a holy and infinite Majesty; to be a just God, and YET a Saviour; to be just to his law, just to his threatening, just to himself, and yet save sinners, can no way be understood till thou understandest why Jesus Christ did hang on the tree; for here only is the riddle unfolded, 'Christ died for our sins,' and therefore can God in justice save us (Isa 45:21).","And hence is Christ called the Wisdom of God, not only because he is so essentially, but because by him is the greatest revelation of his wisdom towards man.","In redemption, therefore, by the blood of Christ, God is said to abound towards us in all wisdom (Eph 1:7,8).","Here we see the highest contradictions reconciled, here justice kisseth the sinner, here a man stands just in the sight of God while confounded at his own pollutions, and here he that hath done no good hath yet a sufficient righteousness, even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ.",Second.,The JUSTICE of God is here more seen than in punishing all the damned.,"'He spared not his own Son,' is a sentence which more revealeth the nature of the justice of God than if it had said, He spared not all the world.","True, he cast angels from heaven, and drowned the old world; he turned Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, with many more of like nature; but what were all these to the cursing of his Son?","Yea, what were ten thousand such manifestations of his ireful indignation against sin, to that of striking, afflicting, chastising, and making the darling of his bosom the object of his wrath and judgment?","Here it is seen he respecteth not persons, but judgeth sin, and condemneth him on whom it is found; yea, although on Jesus Christ his well-beloved (Rom 8:32; Gal 3:13).",Third.,"The mystery of God's WILL is here more seen than in hanging the earth upon nothing, while he condemneth Christ, though righteous, and justifieth us, though sinners, while he maketh him to be sin for us, and us the righteousness of God in him (1 Peter 3:18; 2 Cor 5:20).",Fourth.,"The POWER of God is here more seen than in making of heaven and earth; for one to bear, and get the victory over sin, when charged by the justice of an infinite majesty, in so doing he showeth the height of the highest power; for where sin by the law is charged, and that by God immediately, there an infinite majesty opposeth, and that with the whole of his justice, holiness, and power; so then, he that is thus charged and engaged for the sin of the world, must not only be equal with God, but show it by overcoming that curse and judgment that by infinite justice is charged upon him for sin.","When angels and men had sinned, how did they fall and crumble before the anger of God!","they had not power to withstand the terror, nor could there be worth found in their persons or doings to appease displeased justice.","But behold here stands the Son of God before him in the sin of the world; his Father, finding him there, curseth and condemns him to death; but he, by the power of his Godhead, and the worthiness of his person and doings, vanquisheth sin, satisfieth God's justice, and so becomes the Saviour of the world.","Here, then, is power seen: sin is a mighty thing, it crusheth all in pieces save him whose Spirit is eternal (Heb 9:14).","Set Christ and his sufferings aside, and you neither see the evil of sin nor the displeasure of God against it; you see them not in their utmost.","Hadst thou a view of all the legions that are now in the pains of hell, yea, couldst thou hear their shrieks and groans together at once, and feel the whole of all their burden, much of the evil of sin and of the justice of God against it would be yet unknown by thee, for thou wouldest want power to feel and bear the utmost.","A giant shows not his power by killing of a little child, nor yet is his might seen by the resistance that such a little one makes, but then he showeth his power when he dealeth with one like himself; yea, and the power also of the other is then made manifest in saving himself from being swallowed up with his wrath.","Jesus Christ also made manifest his eternal power and Godhead, more by bearing and overcoming our sins, than in making or upholding the whole world; hence Christ crucified is called 'the power of God' (1 Cor 1:23,24).",Fifth.,The LOVE and MERCY of God are more seen in and by this doctrine than any other way.,"Mercy and love are seen, in that God gives us rain and fruitful seasons, and in that he filleth our hearts with food and gladness; from that bounty which he bestoweth upon us as men, as his creatures.",O!,"but herein is love made manifest, in that 'Christ laid down his life for us.'","'And God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us' (1 John 3:16; Rom 5:8).","Never love like this, nor did God ever give such discovery of his love from the beginning to this day.","'Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins' (1 John 4:10).","Here is love, that God sent his Son, his darling, his Son that never offended, his Son that was always his delight!","Herein is love, that he sent him to save sinners, to save them by bearing their sins, by bearing their curse, by dying their death, and by carrying their sorrows!","Here is love, in that while we were yet enemies, Christ died for us; yea, here is love, in that while 'we were yet without strength, Christ died for the ungodly' (Rom 5:6).",THE SECOND USE.,[SECOND.],"But as this doctrine giveth us the best discovery of God, so also it giveth us the best discovery of ourselves and our own things.",First.,It giveth us the best discovery of ourselves.,"Wouldst thou know, sinner, what thou art?","look up to the cross, and behold a weeping, bleeding, dying Jesus: nothing could do but that, nothing could save thee but his blood; angels could not, saints could not, God could not, because he could not lie, because he could not deny himself.","What a thing is sin, that it should sink all that bear its burden!","yea, it sunk the Son of God himself into death and the grave, and had also sunk him into hell-fire for ever had he not been the Son of God, had he not been able to take it on his back, and bear it away!",O this Lamb of God!,"Sinners were going to hell, Christ was the delight of his Father, and had a whole heaven to himself; but that did not content him, heaven could not hold him; he must come into the world to save sinners (1 Tim 1:15).","Aye, and had he not come, thy sins had sunk thee, thy sins had provoked the wrath of God against thee, to thy perdition and destruction for ever.","There is no man but is a sinner, there is no sin but would damn an angel, should God lay it to his charge.","Sinner, the doctrine of Christ crucified crieth therefore aloud unto thee, that sin hath made thy condition dreadful.","See yourselves, your sin, and consequently the condition that your souls are in, by the death and blood of Christ; Christ's death giveth us the most clear discovery of the dreadful nature of our sins.","I say again, if sin be so dreadful a thing as to break the heart of the Son of God, for so he said it did, how shall a poor, wretched, impenitent, damned sinner wrestle with the wrath of God?","Awake, sinners; you are lost, you are undone, you are damned, hell-fire is your portion for ever, if you abide in your sins, and be found without a Saviour in the dreadful day of judgment.",Second.,For your good deeds cannot help you; the blood of Christ tells you so.,"For by this doctrine, 'Christ died for our sins,' God damneth to death and hell the righteousness of the world.","Christ must die, or man be damned.",Where is now any room for the righteousness of men?,"room, I say, for man's righteousness, as to his acceptance and justification?","Bring, then, thy righteousness to the cross of Jesus Christ, and in his blood behold the demands of justice; behold them, I say, in the cries and tears, in the blood and death of Jesus Christ.","Look again, and behold the person dying; such an one as never sinned nor offended at any time, yet he dies.","Could a holy life, an innocent, harmless conversation, have saved one from death, Jesus had not died.","But he must die; sin was charged, therefore Christ must die.","Men, therefore, need to go no further to prove the worth of their own righteousness than to the death of Christ; they need not be waiting to seek in that matter till they stand before the judgment-seat.",Quest.,But how should I prove [or try] the goodness of mine own righteousness by the death and blood of Christ?,Answ.,"Thus: if Christ must die for sin, then all thy righteousness cannot save thee.","'If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain' (Gal 2:21).","By this text it is manifest that either Christ died in vain, or thy righteousness is vain.","If thy righteousness can save thee, then Christ died in vain; if nothing below or besides the death of Christ could save thee, then thy righteousness is in vain; one of the two must be cast away, either Christ's or thine.","Christ crucified to save the world, discovereth two great evils in man's own righteousness; I mean, when brought for justification and life.",1.,It opposeth the righteousness of Christ.,2.,It condemneth God of foolishness.,1.,"It opposeth the righteousness of Christ, in that it seeketh itself to stand where should the righteousness of Christ--to wit, in God's affection for the justification of thy person; and this is one of the highest affronts to Christ that poor man is capable to give him: right worthily, therefore, doth the doctrine of the gospel damn the righteousness of men, and promiseth the kingdom of God to publicans and harlots rather.",2.,"It condemneth God of foolishness; for if works of righteousness which we can do can justify from the curse of the law in the sight of God, then are not all the treasures of wisdom found in the heart of God and Christ; for this dolt-headed sinner hath now found out a way of his own, unawares to God, to secure his soul from wrath and vengeance; I say, unawares to God, for he never imagined that such a thing could be; for had he, he would never have purposed before the world began to send his Son to die for sinners.","Christ is the wisdom of God, as you have heard, and that as he is our justifying righteousness.","God was manifest in the flesh to save us, is the great mystery of godliness.","But wherein lieth the depth of this wisdom of God in our salvation, if man's righteousness can save him?",(Job 40:10-14).,"Yea, wherefore hath God also given it out that there is none other name given to men under heaven whereby we must be saved?","I say again, why is it affirmed 'without shedding of blood is no remission,' if man's good deeds can save him?","This doctrine, therefore, of the righteousness of Christ being rightly preached, and truly believed, arraigneth and condemneth man's righteousness to hell; it casteth it out as Abraham cast out Ishmael.","Blood, blood, the sound of blood, abaseth all the glory of it!","When men have said all, and showed us what they can, they have no blood to present God's justice with; yet it is blood that maketh an atonement for the soul, and nothing but blood can wash away from us our sins (Lev 17:11; Rev 1:5; Heb 9).","Justice calls for blood, sins call for blood, the righteous law calls for blood, yea, the devil himself must be overcome by blood.","Sinner, where is now thy righteousness?","Bring it before a consuming fire, for our God is a consuming fire; bring it before the justice of the law; yea, try if aught but the blood of Christ can save thee from thy sins, and devils; try it, I say, by this doctrine; go not one step further before thou hast tried it.",Third.,By this doctrine we are made to see the worth of souls.,"It cannot be but that the soul is of wonderful price, when the Son of God will not stick to spill his blood for it.","O sinners, you that will venture your souls for a little pleasure, surely you know not the worth of your souls.","Now, if you would know what your souls are worth, and the price which God sets them at, read that price by the blood of Christ.",The blood of Christ was spilt to save souls.,"'For ye are bought with a price,' and that price none other than the blood of Christ; 'therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's (1 Cor 6:20).","Sinners, you have souls, can you behold a crucified Christ, and not bleed, and not mourn, and not fall in love with him?",THE THIRD USE.,[THIRD.],"By this doctrine sinners, as sinners, are encouraged to come to God for mercy, for the curse due to sin is taken out of the way.","I speak now to sinners that are awake, and see themselves sinners.","There are two things in special when men begin to be awakened, that kill their thoughts of being saved.",1.,A sense of sin.,2.,The wages due thereto.,These kill the heart; for who can bear up under the guilt of sin?,"'If our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?'",(Eze 33:10).,How indeed!,it is impossible.,So neither can man grapple with the justice of God.,"'Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong?'",They cannot (Eze 22:14).,'A wounded spirit who can bear?',(Prov 18:14).,"Men cannot, angels cannot.","Wherefore, if now Christ be hid, and the blessing of faith in his blood denied, woe be to them; such go after Saul and Judas, one to the sword, and the other to the halter, and so miserably end their days; for come to God they dare not; the thoughts of that eternal Majesty strike them through.","But now, present such poor dejected sinners with a crucified Christ, and persuade them that the sins under which they shake and tremble were long ago laid upon the back of Christ, and the noise and sense and fear of damning begins to cease, depart, and fly away; dolors and terrors fade and vanish, and that soul conceiveth hopes of life; for thus the soul argueth, Is this indeed the truth of God, that Christ was made to be sin for me?",was made the curse of God for me?,"Hath he indeed borne all my sins, and spilt his blood for my redemption!",O Blessed tidings!,O welcome grace!,"'Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.'","Now is peace come; now the face of heaven is altered; 'Behold, all things are become new.'","Now the sinner can abide God's presence, yea, sees unutterable glory and beauty in him; for here he sees justice smite.","While Jacob was afraid of Esau, how heavily did he drive even towards the promised land?","but when killing thoughts were turned into kissing, and the fears of the sword's point turned into brother embraces, what says he?--'I have seen thy face as though it had been the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me' (Gen 33:10).",So and far better is it with a poor distressed sinner at the revelation of the grace of God through Jesus Christ.,"'God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.'","O what work will such a word make upon a wounded conscience, especially when the next words follow--'For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him!'","Now, the soul sees qualifications able to set him quit in the sight of God; qualifications prepared already.","Prepared, I say, already; and that by God through Christ; even such as can perfectly answer the law.",What doth the law require?,"If obedience, here it is; if bloody sacrifice, here it is; if infinite righteousness, here it is!","Now, then, the law condemns him that believes before God no more; for all its demands are answered, all its curses are swallowed up in the death and curse Christ underwent.",Object.,"But reason saith, since personal sin brought the death, surely personal obedience must bring us life and glory.",Answ.,"True reason saith so, and so doth the law itself (Rom 10:5); but God, we know, is above them both, and he in the covenant of grace saith otherwise; to wit, that 'if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved' (Rom 10:9).","Let reason, then, hold its tongue, yea, let the law with all its wisdom subject itself to him that made it; let it look for sin where God hath laid it; let it approve the righteousness which God approveth; yea, though it be not that of the law, but that by faith of Jesus Christ.","God hath made him our righteousness, God hath made him our sin, God hath made him our curse, God hath made him our blessing; methinks this word, 'God hath made it so,' should silence all the world.",THE FOURTH USE.,[FOURTH.],"By this doctrine, sufficiency of argument is ministered to the tempted to withstand hereby the assaults of the devil.","When souls begin to seek after the Lord Jesus, then Satan begins to afflict and distress, as the Canaanites did the Gibeonites, for making peace with Joshua (Josh 10:1,6).",There are three things that do usually afflict the soul that is earnestly looking after Jesus Christ.,First.,Dreadful accusations from Satan.,Second.,Grievous defiling and infectious thoughts.,Third.,A strange readiness in our nature to fall in with both.,First.,"By the first of these, the heart is made continually to tremble.","Hence his temptations are compared to the roaring of a lion, for as the lion by roaring killeth the heart of his prey, so doth Satan kill the spirit of these that hearken to him (1 Peter 5:8); for when he tempteth, especially by way of accusation, he doth to us as Rabshakeh did to the Jews; he speaks to us in our own language; he speaks our sin at every word, our guilty conscience knows it; he speaks our death at every word, our doubting conscience feels it.",Second.,"Besides this, there doth now arise, even in the heart, such defiling and foul infectious thoughts that putteth the tempted to their wits' end; for now it seems to the soul that the very flood-gates of the flesh are opened, and that to sin there is no stop at all; now the air seems to be covered with darkness, and the man is as if he was changed into the nature of a devil; now if ignorance and unbelief prevail, he concludeth that he is a reprobate, made to be taken and destroyed.",Third.,"Now also he feeleth in him a readiness to fall in with every temptation; a readiness, I say, continually present (Rom 7:21).",This throws all down.,"Now despair begins to swallow him up; now he can neither pray, nor read, nor hear, nor meditate on God, but fire and smoke continually bursteth forth of the heart against him.","Now sin and great confusion puts forth itself in all; yea, the more the sinner desireth to do a duty sincerely, the further off it always find itself; for by how much the soul struggleth under these distresses, by so much the more doth Satan put forth himself to resist, still infusing more poison, that if possible it might never struggle more, for strugglings are also as poison to Satan.","The fly in the spider's web is an emblem of the soul in such a condition--the fly is entangled in the web; at this the spider shows himself; if the fly stir again, down comes the spider to her, and claps a foot upon her; if yet the fly makes a noise, then with poisoned mouth the spider lays hold upon her; if the fly struggle still, then he poisons her more and more.",What shall the fly do now?,"Why, she dies, if somebody does not quickly release her.","This is the case of the tempted; they are entangled in the web, their feet and wings are entangled; now Satan shows himself; if the soul now struggleth, Satan laboureth to hold it down; if it now shall make a noise, then he bites with blasphemous mouth, more poisonous than the gall of a serpent; if it struggle again, then he poisoneth more and more, insomuch that it needs, at last, must die in the net, if the man, the lord Jesus, help not out.",[6] The afflicted conscience understands my words.,"Further, though the fly in the web is altogether incapable of looking for relief, yet this awakened, tempted Christian is not.",What must he do therefore?,How should he contain hopes of life?,"If he look to his heart, there is blasphemy; if he look to his duties, there is sin; if he strive to mourn and lament, perhaps he cannot; unbelief and hardness hinder.",Shall this man lie down and despair?,No.,Shall he trust to his duties?,No.,Shall he stay from Christ till his heart is better?,No.,What then?,"Let him NOW look to Jesus Christ crucified, then shall he see his sins answered for, then shall he see death a-dying, then shall he see guilt borne by another, and there shall he see the devil overcome.","This sight destroys the power of the first temptation, purifies the heart, and inclines the mind to all good things.","And to encourage thee, tempted creature, to this most gospel duty, consider that when Jesus Christ read his commission upon the entering into his ministry, he proclaimed, 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord' (Luke 4:18,19).","These things therefore should the tempted believe; but believing is now sweating work; for Satan will hold as long as possible, and only steadfast faith can make him fly.","But O, the toil of a truly gracious heart in this combat!","If faith be weak, he can scarce get higher than his knees; Lord, help!","Lord, save!","and then down again, till an arm from heaven takes him up, until Jesus Christ be evidently set forth crucified for him, and cursed for his sin; for then, and not till then, the temptation rightly ceaseth, at leastwise for a season.","Now the soul can tend to look about it, and thus consider with itself: if Christ hath borne my sin and curse, then it is taken away from me; and seeing thus to take away sin was the contrivance of the God of heaven, I will bless his name, hope in his mercy, and look upon death and hell with comfort.","'Thine heart shall meditate terror,' thou shalt see the land that is very far off (Isa 33:16-18).",THE FIFTH USE.,[FIFTH.],"this doctrine makes Christ precious to the believers--'Unto you therefore which believe, he is precious' (1 Peter 2:7).","This head might be greatly enlarged upon, and branched out into a thousand particulars, and each one full of weight and glory.",1.,By considering what sin is.,2.,By considering what hell is.,3.,By considering what wrath is.,4.,By considering what eternity is.,5.,By considering what the loss of a soul is.,6.,What the loss of God is.,7.,What the loss of heaven is.,8.,And what it is to be in utter darkness with devils and damned souls for ever and ever.,"And after all to conclude, from all the miseries the Lord Jesus delivered me.","Further, this makes Christ precious, if I consider, in the next place, 1.","How he did deliver me; it was with his life, his blood; it cost him tears, groans, agony, separation from God; to do it he endured his Father's wrath, bore his Father's curse, and died thousands of deaths at once.",2.,"He did this while I was his enemy, without my desires, without my knowledge, without my deserts; he did it unawares to me.",3.,"He did it freely, cheerfully, yea, he longed to die for me; yea, heaven would not hold him for the love he had to my salvation, which also he hath effectually accomplished for me at Jerusalem.",Honourable Jesus!,precious Jesus!,loving Jesus!,"Jonathan's kindness captivated David, and made him precious in his eyes for ever.","'I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan,' said he; 'very pleasant hast thou been unto me; thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women' (2 Sam 1:26).","Why, what had Jonathan done?","O, he had delivered David from the wrath of Saul.",But how much more should he be precious to me who hath saved me from death and hell!,who hath delivered me from the wrath of God!,'The love of Christ constraineth us.',"Nothing will so edge the spirit of a Christian as, 'Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood.'",This makes the heavens themselves ring with joy and shouting.,"Mark the words, 'Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.'",What follows now?,"'And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.","And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever' (Rev 5:9-14).","Thus also is the song, that new song that is said to be sung by the hundred forty and four thousand which stand with the Lamb upon Mount Sion, with his Father's name written in their foreheads.","These are also called harpers, harping with their harps: 'And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth' (Rev 14:1-3).",But why could they not learn that song?,"Because they were not redeemed: none can sing of this song but the redeemed; they can give glory to the Lamb, the Lamb that was slain, and that redeemed them to God by his blood.",It is faith in his blood on earth that will make us sing this song in heaven.,These shoutings and heavenly songs must needs come from love put into a flame by the sufferings of Christ.,THE LAST USE.,"If all these things be true, what follows but a demonstration of the accursed condition of those among the religious in these nations whose notions put them far off from Jesus, and from venturing their souls upon his bloody death?","I have observed such a spirit as this in the world that careth not for knowing of Jesus; the possessed therewith do think that it is not material to salvation to venture upon a crucified Christ, neither do they trouble their heads or hearts with inquiring whether Christ Jesus be risen and ascended into heaven, or whether they see him again or no, but rather are for concluding that there will be no such thing: these men speak not by the Holly Ghost, for in the sum they call Jesus accursed; but I doubt not to say that many of them are anathematized of God, and shall stand so, till the coming of the Lord Jesus, to whom be glory for ever and ever.",Amen.,[7] FOOTNOTES: 1.,"In this quotation, Bunyan has followed the Genevan or Puritan version.","It was a favourite version with our pilgrim forefathers, and is in many texts more faithful than our authorized translation;

I shall not trouble you with a long preamble, or forespeech to the matter, nor shall I here so much as meddle with the context, but shall immediately fall upon the words themselves, and briefly treat of the fear of God.","The text, you see, presenteth us with matter of greatest moment, to wit, with God, and with the fear of him.","First they present us with God, the true and living God, maker of the worlds, and upholder of all things by the word of his power: that incomprehensible majesty, in comparison of whom all nations are less than the drop of a bucket, and than the small dust of the balance.","This is he that fills heaven and earth, and is everywhere present with the children of men, beholding the evil and the good; for he hath set his eyes upon all their ways.","So that, considering that by the text we have presented to our souls the Lord God and Maker of us all, who also will be either our Saviour or Judge, we are in reason and duty bound to give the more earnest heed to the things that shall be spoken, and be the more careful to receive them, and put them in practice; for, as I said, as they present us with the mighty God, so they exhort us to the highest duty towards him; to wit, to fear him.","I call it the highest duty, because it is, as I may call it, not only a duty in itself, but, as it were, the salt that seasoneth every duty.","For there is no duty performed by us that can by any means be accepted of God, if it be not seasoned with godly fear.","Wherefore the apostle saith, ""Let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.""","Of this fear, I say, I would discourse at this time; but because this word fear is variously taken in the Scripture, and because it may be profitable to us to see it in its variety, I shall therefore choose this method for the managing of my discourse, even to show you the nature of the word in its several, especially of the chiefest, acceptations.",FIRST.,"Then by this word fear we are to understand even God himself, who is the object of our fear.",SECOND.,"By this word fear we are to understand the Word of God, the rule and director of our fear.","Now to speak to this word fear, as it is thus taken.",[THIS WORD FEAR AS TAKEN FOR GOD HIMSELF.],FIRST.,"Of this word ""fear,"" AS IT RESPECTETH GOD HIMSELF, who is the object of our fear.","By this word fear, as I said, we are to understand God himself, who is the object of our fear: For the Divine majesty goeth often under this very name himself.","This name Jacob called him by, when he and Laban chid together on Mount Gilead, after that Jacob had made his escape to his father's house; ""Except,"" said he, ""the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty.""","So again, a little after, when Jacob and Laban agree to make a covenant of peace each with other, though Laban, after the jumbling way of the heathen by his oath, puts the true God and the false together, yet ""Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac"" (Gen 31:42,53).","[1] By the fear, that is, by the God of his father Isaac.","And, indeed, God may well be called the fear of his people, not only because they have by his grace made him the object of their fear, but because of the dread and terrible majesty that is in him.","""He is a mighty God, a great and terrible, and with God is terrible majesty"" (Dan 7:28, 10:17; Neh 1:5, 4:14, 9:32; Job 37:22).",Who knows the power of his anger?,"""The mountains quake at him, the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.",Who can stand before his indignation?,who can abide in the fierceness of his anger?,"his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him"" (Nahum 1:5,6).","His people know him, and have his dread upon them, by virtue whereof there is begot and maintained in them that godly awe and reverence of his majesty which is agreeable to their profession of him.","""Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.""","Set his majesty before the eyes of your souls, and let his excellency make you afraid with godly fear (Isa 8:13).",There are these things that make God to be the fear of his people.,First.,"His presence is dreadful, and that not only his presence in common, but his special, yea, his most comfortable and joyous presence.","When God comes to bring a soul news of mercy and salvation, even that visit, that presence of God, is fearful.","When Jacob went from Beersheba towards Haran, he met with God in the way by a dream, in the which he apprehended a ladder set upon the earth, whose top reached to heaven; now in this dream, from the top of this ladder, he saw the Lord, and heard him speak unto him, not threateningly; not as having his fury come up into his face; but in the most sweet and gracious manner, saluting him with promise of goodness after promise of goodness, to the number of eight or nine; as will appear if you read the place.","Yet I say, when he awoke, all the grace that discovered itself in this heavenly vision to him could not keep him from dread and fear of God's majesty.","""And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not; and he was afraid and said, How dreadful is this place!","this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven"" (Gen 28:10-17).","At another time, to wit, when Jacob had that memorable visit from God, in which he gave him power as a prince to prevail with him; yea, and gave him a name, that by his remembering it he might call God's favour the better to his mind; yet even then and there such dread of the majesty of God was upon him, that he went away wondering that his life was preserved (Gen 32:30).","Man crumbles to dust at the presence of God; yea, though he shows himself to us in his robes of salvation.","We have read how dreadful and how terrible even the presence of angels have been unto men, and that when they have brought them good tidings from heaven (Judg 13:22; Matt 28:4; Mark 16:5,6).","Now, if angels, which are but creatures, are, through the glory that God has put upon them, so fearful and terrible in their appearance to men, how much more dreadful and terrible must God himself be to us, who are but dust and ashes!","When Daniel had the vision of his salvation sent him from heaven, for so it was, ""O Daniel,"" said the messenger, ""a man greatly beloved""; yet behold the dread and terror of the person speaking fell with that weight upon this good man's soul, that he could not stand, nor bear up under it.","He stood trembling, and cries out, ""O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.",For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord?,"for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me"" (Dan 10:16-17).","See you here if the presence of God is not a dreadful and a fearful thing; yea, his most gracious and merciful appearances; how much more then when he showeth himself to us as one that disliketh our ways, as one that is offended with us for our sins?",And there are three things that in an eminent manner make his presence dreadful to us.,1.,"The first is God's own greatness and majesty; the discovery of this, or of himself thus, even as no poor mortals are able to conceive of him, is altogether unsupportable.",The man dies to whom he thus discovers himself.,"""And when I saw him,"" says John, ""I fell at his feet as dead"" (Rev 1:17).","It was this, therefore, that Job would have avoided in the day that he would have approached unto him.","""Let not thy dread,"" says he, ""make me afraid.","Then call thou, and I will answer; or let me speak, and answer thou me"" (Job 13:21,22).",But why doth Job after this manner thus speak to God?,Why!,"it was from a sense that he had of the dreadful majesty of God, even the great and dreadful God that keepeth covenant with his people.","The presence of a king is dreadful to the subject, yea, though he carries it never so condescendingly; if then there be so much glory and dread in the presence of the king, what fear and dread must there be, think you, in the presence of the eternal God?",2.,"When God giveth his presence to his people, that his presence causeth them to appear to themselves more what they are, than at other times, by all other light, they can see.","""O my lord,"" said Daniel, ""by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me""; and why was that, but because by the glory of that vision, he saw his own vileness more than at other times.","So again: ""I was left alone,"" says he, ""and saw this great vision""; and what follows?","Why, ""and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned into corruption, and I retained no strength"" (Dan 10:8,16).","By the presence of God, when we have it indeed, even our best things, our comeliness, our sanctity and righteousness, all do immediately turn to corruption and polluted rags.","The brightness of his glory dims them as the clear light of the shining sun puts out the glory of the fire or candle, and covers them with the shadow of death.",See also the truth of this in that vision of the prophet Isaiah.,"""Wo is me,"" said he, ""for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.""","Why, what is the matter?",how came the prophet by this sight?,"Why, says he, ""mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts"" (Isa 6:5).",But do you think that this outcry was caused by unbelief?,No; nor yet begotten by slavish fear.,"This was to him the vision of his Saviour, with whom also he had communion before (vv 2-5).","It was the glory of that God with whom he had now to do, that turned, as was noted before of Daniel, his comeliness in him into corruption, and that gave him yet greater sense of the disproportion that was betwixt his God and him, and so a greater sight of his defiled and polluted nature.",3.,"Add to this the revelation of God's goodness, and it must needs make his presence dreadful to us; for when a poor defiled creature shall see that this great God hath, notwithstanding his greatness, goodness in his heart, and mercy to bestow upon him: this makes his presence yet the more dreadful.","They ""shall fear the Lord and his goodness"" (Hosea 3:5).",The goodness as well as the greatness of God doth beget in the heart of his elect an awful reverence of his majesty.,"""Fear ye not me?","saith the Lord; will ye not tremble at my presence?""","And then, to engage us in our soul to the duty, he adds one of his wonderful mercies to the world, for a motive, ""Fear ye not me?""","Why, who are thou?","He answers, Even I, ""which have"" set, or ""placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it; and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?""",(Jer 5:22).,"Also, when Job had God present with him, making manifest the goodness of his great heart to him, what doth he say?",how doth he behave himself in his presence?,"""I have heard of thee,"" says he, ""by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee; wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes"" (Job 42:5,6).","And what mean the tremblings, the tears, those breakings and shakings of heart that attend the people of God, when in an eminent manner they receive the pronunciation of the forgiveness of sins at his mouth, but that the dread of the majesty of God is in their sight mixed therewith?","God must appear like himself, speak to the soul like himself; nor can the sinner, when under these glorious discoveries of his Lord and Saviour, keep out the beams of his majesty from the eyes of his understanding.","""I will cleanse them,"" saith he, ""from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me, and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.""",And what then?,"""And they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness, and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it"" (Jer 33:8,9).",Alas!,"there is a company of poor, light, frothy professors in the world, that carry it under that which they call the presence of God, more like to antics, than sober sensible Christians; yea, more like to a fool of a play, than those that have the presence of God.","They would not carry it so in the presence of a king, nor yet of the lord of their land, were they but receivers of mercy at his hand.","They carry it even in their most eminent seasons, as if the sense and sight of God, and his blessed grace to their souls in Christ, had a tendency in them to make men wanton: but indeed it is the most humbling and heart-breaking sight in the world; it is fearful.",[2] Object.,But would you not have us rejoice at the sight and sense of the forgiveness of our sins?,Answ.,"Yes; but yet I would have you, and indeed you shall, when God shall tell you that your sins are pardoned indeed, ""rejoice with trembling"" (Psa 2:11).","For then you have solid and godly joy; a joyful heart, and wet eyes, in this will stand very well together; and it will be so more or less.","For if God shall come to you indeed, and visit you with the forgiveness of sins, that visit removeth the guilt, but increaseth the sense of thy filth, and the sense of this that God hath forgiven a filthy sinner, will make thee both rejoice and tremble.","O, the blessed confusion that will then cover thy face whilst thou, even thou, so vile a wretch, shalt stand before God to receive at his hand thy pardon, and so the firstfruits of thy eternal salvation--""That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame (thy filth), when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God"" (Eze 16:63).","But, Second.","As the presence, so the name of God, is dreadful and fearful: wherefore his name doth rightly go under the same title, ""That thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD"" (Deut 28:58).","The name of God, what is that, but that by which he is distinguished and known from all others?","Names are to distinguish by; so man is distinguished from beasts, and angels from men; so heaven from earth, and darkness from light; especially when by the name, the nature of the thing is signified and expressed; and so it was in their original, for then names expressed the nature of the thing so named.","And therefore it is that the name of God is the object of our fear, because by his name his nature is expressed: ""Holy and reverend is his name"" (Psa 111:9).","And again, he proclaimed the name of the Lord, ""The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth; keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty"" (Exo 34:6,7).","Also his name, I am, Jah, Jehovah, with several others, what is by them intended but his nature, as his power, wisdom, eternity, goodness, and omnipotency, &c., might be expressed and declared.",The name of God is therefore the object of a Christian's fear.,David prayed to God that he would unite his heart to fear his name (Psa 86:11).,"Indeed, the name of God is a fearful name, and should always be reverenced by his people: yea his ""name is to be feared for ever and ever,"" and that not only in his church, and among his saints, but even in the world and among the heathen--""So the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord, and all kings thy glory"" (Psa 102:15).","God tells us that his name is dreadful, and that he is pleased to see men be afraid before his name.","Yea, one reason why he executeth so many judgments upon men as he doth, is that others might see and fear his name.","""So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun"" (Isa 59:19; Mal 2:5).","The name of a king is a name of fear--""And I am a great king, saith the Lord of hosts"" (Mal 1:14).","The name of master is a name of fear--""And if I be a master, where is my fear?","saith the Lord"" (v 6).","Yea, rightly to fear the Lord is a sign of a gracious heart.","And again, ""To you that fear my name,"" saith he, ""shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings"" (Mal 4:2).","Yea, when Christ comes to judge the world, he will give reward to his servants the prophets, and to his saints, ""and to them that fear his name, small and great"" (Rev 11:18).","Now, I say, since the name of God is that by which his nature is expressed, and since he naturally is so glorious and incomprehensible, his name must needs be the object of our fear, and we ought always to have a reverent awe of God upon our hearts at what time soever we think of, or hear his name, but most of all, when we ourselves do take his holy and fearful name into our mouths, especially in a religious manner, that is, in preaching, praying, or holy conference.","I do not by thus saying intend as if it was lawful to make mention of his name in light and vain discourses; for we ought always to speak of it with reverence and godly fear, but I speak it to put Christians in mind that they should not in religious duties show lightness of mind, or be vain in their words when yet they are making mention of the name of the Lord--""Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity"" (2 Tim 2:19).","Make mention then of the name of the Lord at all times with great dread of his majesty upon our hearts, and in great soberness and truth.","To do otherwise is to profane the name of the Lord, and to take his name in vain; and ""the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.""","Yea, God saith that he will cut off the man that doth it; so jealous is he of the honour due unto his name (Exo 20:7; Lev 20:3).","This therefore showeth you the dreadful state of those that lightly, vainly, lyingly, and profanely make use of the name, this fearful name of God, either by their blasphemous cursing and oaths, or by their fraudulent dealing with their neighbour; for some men have no way to prevail with their neighbour to bow under a cheat, but by calling falsely upon the name of the Lord to be witness that the wickedness is good and honest; but how these men will escape, when they shall be judged, devouring fire and everlasting burnings, for their profaning and blaspheming of the name of the Lord, becomes them betimes to consider of (Jer 14:14,15; Eze 20:39; Exo 20:7).","[3] But, Third.","As the presence and name of God are dreadful and fearful in the church, so is his worship and service.","I say his worship, or the works of service to which we are by him enjoined while we are in this world, are dreadful and fearful things.","This David conceiveth, when he saith, ""But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy, and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple"" (Psa 5:7).","And again, saith he, ""Serve the Lord with fear.""",To praise God is a part of his worship.,"But, says Moses, ""Who is a God like unto thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?""",(Exo 15:11).,"To rejoice before him is a part of his worship; but David bids us ""rejoice with trembling"" (Psa 2:11).","Yea, the whole of our service to God, and every part thereof, ought to be done by us with reverence and godly fear.","And therefore let us, as Paul saith again, ""Cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God"" (2 Cor 7:1; Heb 12).",1.,"That which makes the worship of God so fearful a thing, is, for that it is the worship of GOD: all manner of service carries more or less dread and fear along with it, according as the quality or condition of the person is to whom the worship and service is done.","This is seen in the service of subjects to their princes, the service of servants to their lords, and the service of children to their parents.","Divine worship, then, being due to God, for it is now of Divine worship we speak, and this God so great and dreadful in himself and name, his worship must therefore be a fearful thing.",2.,"Besides, this glorious Majesty is himself present to behold his worshippers in their worshipping him.","""When two or three of you are gathered together in my name, I am there.""","That is, gathered together to worship him, ""I am there,"" says he.","And so, again, he is said to walk ""in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks"" (Rev 1:13).","That is, in the churches, and that with a countenance like the sun, with a head and hair as white as snow, and with eyes like a flame of fire.",This puts dread and fear into his service; and therefore his servants should serve him with fear.,3.,"Above all things, God is jealous of his worship and service.","In all the ten words, he telleth us not anything of his being a jealous God, but in the second, which respecteth his worship (Exo 20).","Look to yourselves therefore, both as to the matter and manner of your worship; ""for I the Lord thy God,"" says he, ""am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children.""",This therefore doth also put dread and fear into the worship and service of God.,4.,"The judgments that sometimes God hath executed upon men for their want of godly fear, while they have been in his worship and service, put fear and dread upon his holy appointments.",(1.),"Nadab and Abihu were burned to death with fire from heaven, because they attempted to offer false fire upon God's altar, and the reason rendered why they were so served, was, because God will be sanctified in them that come nigh him (Lev 10:1-3).","To sanctify his name is to let him be thy dread and thy fear, and to do nothing in his worship but what is well-pleasing to him.","But because these men had not grace to do this, therefore they died before the Lord.",(2.),"Eli's sons, for want of this fear, when they ministered in the holy worship of God, were both slain in one day by the sword of the uncircumcised Philistines (see 1 Sam 2).",(3.),"Uzzah was smitten, and died before the Lord, for but an unadvised touching of the ark, when the men forsook it (1 Chron 13:9,10).",(4.),"Ananias and Sapphira his wife, for telling a lie in the church, when they were before God, were both stricken dead upon the place before them all, because they wanted the fear and dread of God's majesty, name, and service, when they came before him (Acts 5).","This therefore should teach us to conclude, that, next to God's nature and name, his service, his instituted worship, is the most dreadful thing under heaven.","His name is upon his ordinances, his eye is upon the worshippers, and his wrath and judgment upon those that worship not in his fear.","For this cause some of those at Corinth were by God himself cut off, and to others he has given the back, and will again be with them no more (1 Cor 11:27-32).",[4] This also rebuketh three sorts of people.,[Three sorts of people rebuked.],1.,"Such as regard not to worship God at all; be sure they have no reverence of his service, nor fear of his majesty before their eyes.","Sinner, thou dost not come before the Lord to worship him; thou dost not bow before the high God; thou neither worshippest him in thy closet nor in the congregation of saints.","The fury of the Lord and his indignation must in short time be poured out upon thee, and upon the families that call not upon his name (Psa 79:6; Jer 10:25).",2.,"This rebukes such as count it enough to present their body in the place where God is worshipped, not minding with what heart, or with what spirit they come thither.","Some come into the worship of God to sleep there; some come thither to meet with their chapmen, and to get into the wicked fellowship of their vain companions.",Some come thither to feed their lustful and adulterous eyes with the flattering beauty of their fellow-sinners.,"O what a sad account will these worshippers give, when they shall count for all this, and be damned for it, because they come not to worship the Lord with that fear of his name that became them to come in, when they presented themselves before him!",[5] 3.,"This also rebukes those that care not, so they worship, how they worship; how, where, or after what manner they worship God.","Those, I mean, whose fear towards God ""is taught by the precept of men.""","They are hypocrites; their worship also is vain, and a stink in the nostrils of God.","""Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: therefore, behold I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid"" (Isa 29:13,14; Matt 15:7-9; Mark 7:6,7).","[6] Thus I conclude this first thing, namely, that God is called our dread and fear.",OF THIS WORD FEAR AS IT IS TAKEN FOR THE WORD OF GOD.,"I shall now come to the second thing, to wit, to the rule and director of our fear.",SECOND.,"But again, this word FEAR is sometimes to be taken for THE WORD, the written Word of God; for that also is, and ought to be, the rule and director of our fear.","So David calls it in the nineteenth Psalm: ""the fear of the Lord,"" saith he, ""is clean, enduring for ever.""","The fear of the Lord, that is, the Word of the Lord, the written word; for that which he calleth in this place the fear of the Lord, even in the same place he calleth the law, statutes, commandments, and judgments of God.","""The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple: the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes: the fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.""","All these words have respect to the same thing, to wit, to the Word of God, jointly designing the glory of it.","Among which phrases, as you see, this is one, ""The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever.""",This written Word is therefore the object of a Christian's fear.,"This is that also which David intended when he said, ""Come, ye children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord"" (Psa 34:11).","I will teach you the fear, that is, I will teach you the commandments, statutes, and judgments of the Lord, even as Moses commanded the children of Israel--""Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up"" (Deut 6:4-7).","That also in the eleventh of Isaiah intends the same, where the Father saith of the Son, that he shall be of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord; that he may judge and smite the earth with the rod of his mouth.","This rod in the text is none other but the fear, the Word of the Lord; for he was to be of a quick understanding, that he might smite, that is, execute it according to the will of his Father, upon and among the children of men.","Now this, as I said, is called the fear of the Lord, because it is called the rule and director of our fear.",For we know not how to fear the Lord in a saving way without its guidance and direction.,"As it is said of the priest that was sent back from the captivity to Samaria to teach the people to fear the Lord, so it is said concerning the written Word; it is given to us, and left among us, that we may read therein all the days of our life, and learn to fear the Lord (Deut 6:1-3,24, 10:12, 17:19).","And here it is that, trembling at the Word of God, is even by God himself not only taken notice of, but counted as laudable and praiseworthy, as is evident in the case of Josiah (2 Chron 34:26,27).","Such also are the approved of God, let them be condemned by whomsoever: ""Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified; but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed"" (Isa 66:5).","Further, such shall be looked to, by God himself cared for, and watched over, that no distress, temptation, or affliction may overcome them and destroy them--""To this man will I look,"" saith God, ""even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my word.""","It is the same in substance with that in the same prophet in chapter 57: ""For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.""","Yea, the way to escape dangers foretold, is to hearken to, understand, and fear the Word of God--""He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh, made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses,"" and they were secured; but ""he that regarded not the word of the Lord, left his servants and his cattle in the field,"" and they were destroyed of the hail (Exo 9:20-25).","If at any time the sins of a nation or church are discovered and bewailed, it is by them that know and tremble at the word of God.","When Ezra heard of the wickedness of his brethren, and had a desire to humble himself before God for the same, who were they that would assist him in that matter, but they that trembled at the word of God?--""Then,"" saith he, ""were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away"" (Ezra 9:4).","They are such also that tremble at the Word that are best able to give counsel in the matters of God, for their judgment best suiteth with his mind and will: ""Now therefore,"" said he, ""let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the (strange) wives,--according to the counsel of my Lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the law"" (Ezra 10:3).",Now something of the dread and terror of the Word lieth in these things.,First.,"As I have already hinted, from the author of them, they are the words of God.","Therefore you have Moses and the prophets, when they came to deliver their errand, their message to the people, still saying, ""Hear the word of the Lord,"" ""Thus saith the Lord,"" and the like.","So when Ezekiel was sent to the house of Israel, in their state of religion, thus was he bid to say unto them, ""Thus saith the Lord God""; ""Thus saith the Lord God"" (Eze 2:4, 3:11).","This is the honour and majesty, then, that God hath put upon his written Word, and thus he hath done even of purpose, that we might make them the rule and directory of our fear, and that we might stand in awe of, and tremble at them.","When Habakkuk heard the word of the Lord, his belly trembled, and rottenness entered into his bones.","""I trembled in myself,"" said he, ""that I might rest in the day of trouble"" (Hab 3:16).","The word of a king is as the roaring of a lion; where the word of a king is, there is power.","What is it, then, when God, the great God, shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem, whose voice shakes not only the earth, but also heaven?","How doth holy David set it forth; ""The voice of the Lord is powerful, the voice of the Lord is full of majesty,"" &c. (Psa 29).",Second.,"It is a Word that is fearful, and may well be called the fear of the Lord, because of the subject matter of it; to wit, the state of sinners in another world; for that is it unto which the whole Bible bendeth itself, either more immediately or more mediately.","All its doctrines, counsels, encouragements, threatenings, and judgments, have a look, one way or other, upon us, with respect to the next world, which will be our last state, because it will be to us a state eternal.","This word, this law, these judgments, are they that we shall be disposed of by--""The word that I have spoken,"" says Christ, ""it shall judge you (and so consequently dispose of you) in the last day"" (John 12:48).","Now, if we consider that our next state must be eternal, either eternal glory or eternal fire, and that this eternal glory or this eternal fire must be our portion, according as the words of God, revealed in the holy Scriptures, shall determine; who will not but conclude that therefore the words of God are they at which we should tremble, and they by which we should have our fear of God guided and directed, for by them we are taught how to please him in everything?",Third.,"It is to be called a fearful Word, because of the truth and faithfulness of it.",The Scriptures cannot be broken.,"Here they are called the Scriptures of truth, the true sayings of God, and also the fear of the Lord, for that every jot and tittle thereof is for ever settled in heaven, and stand more steadfast than doth the world--""Heaven and earth,"" saith Christ, ""shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away"" (Matt 24:35).","Those, therefore, that are favoured by the Word of God, those are favoured indeed, and that with the favour that no man can turn away; but those that by the word of the Scriptures are condemned, those can no man justify and set quit in the sight of God.","Therefore what is bound by the text, is bound, and what is released by the text, is released; also the bond and release is unalterable (Dan 10:21; Rev 19:9; Matt 24:35; Psa 119:89; John 10:35).","This, therefore, calleth upon God's people to stand more in fear of the Word of God than of all the terrors of the world.","[7] There wanteth even in the hearts of God's people a greater reverence of the Word of God than to this day appeareth among us, and this let me say, that want of reverence of the Word is the ground of all disorders that are in the heart, life, conversation, and in Christian communion.","Besides, the want of reverence of the Word layeth men open to the fearful displeasure of God--""Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed; but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded"" (Prov 13:13).","All transgression beginneth at wandering from the Word of God; but, on the other side, David saith, ""Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer"" (Psa 17:4).","Therefore Solomon saith, ""My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings; let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart; for they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh"" (Prov 4:20-22).","Now, if indeed thou wouldest reverence the Word of the Lord, and make it thy rule and director in all things, believe that the Word is the fear of the Lord, the Word that standeth fast for ever; without and against which God will do nothing, either in saving or damning of the souls of sinners.","But to conclude this, 1.","Know that those that have no due regard to the Word of the Lord, and that make it not their dread and their fear, but the rule of their life is the lust of their flesh, the desire of their eyes, and the pride of life, are sorely rebuked by this doctrine, and are counted the fools of the world; for ""lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord, and what wisdom is in them?""",(Jer 8:9).,"That there are such a people is evident, not only by their irregular lives, but by the manifest testimony of the Word.","""As for the word of the Lord,"" said they to Jeremiah, ""that thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee, but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth"" (Jer 44:16).",Was this only the temper of wicked men then?,Is not the same spirit of rebellion amongst us in our days?,"Doubtless there is; for there is no new thing--""The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be, and that which is done is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun"" (Eccl 1:9).","Therefore, as it was then, so it is with many in this day.","As for the Word of the Lord, it is nothing at all to them; their lusts, and whatsoever proceedeth out of their own mouths, that they will do, that they will follow.","Now, such will certainly perish in their own rebellion; for this is as the sin of witchcraft; it was the sin of Korah and his company, and that which brought upon them such heavy judgments; yea, and they are made a sign that thou shouldest not do as they, for they perished (because they rejected the word, the fear of the Lord) from among the congregation of the Lord, ""and they became a sign.""","The word which thou despisest still abideth to denounce its woe and judgment upon thee; and unless God will save such with the breath of his word--and it is hard trusting to that--they must never see his face with comfort (1 Sam 15:22,23; Num 26:9,10).",2.,Are the words of God called by the name of the fear of the Lord?,Are they so dreadful in their receipt and sentence?,"Then this rebukes them that esteem the words and things of men more than the words of God, as those do who are drawn from their respect of, and obedience to, the Word of God, by the pleasures or threats of men.","Some there be who verily will acknowledge the authority of the Word, yet will not stoop their souls thereto.","Such, whatever they think of themselves, are judged by Christ to be ashamed of the Word; wherefore their state is damnable as the other.","""Whosoever,"" saith he, ""shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of the Father, with the holy angels"" (Mark 8:38).",3.,"And if these things be so, what will become of those that mock at, and professedly contemn, the words of God, making them as a thing ridiculous, and not to be regarded?",Shall they prosper that do such things?,"From the promises it is concluded that their judgment now of a long time slumbereth not, and when it comes, it will devour them without remedy (2 Chron 36:15).","If God, I say, hath put that reverence upon his Word as to call it the fear of the Lord, what will become of them that do what they can to overthrow its authority, by denying it to be his Word, and by raising cavils against its authority?","Such stumble, indeed, at the Word, being appointed thereunto, but it shall judge them in the last day (1 Peter 2:8; John 12:48).",But thus much for this.,OF SEVERAL SORTS OF FEAR OF GOD IN THE HEART OF THE CHILDREN OF MEN.,"Having thus spoken of the object and rule of our fear, I should come now to speak of fear as it is a grace of the Spirit of God in the hearts of his people; but before I do that, I shall show you that there are divers sorts of fear besides.","For man being a reasonable creature, and having even by nature a certain knowledge of God, hath also naturally something of some kind of fear of God at times, which, although it be not that which is intended in the text, yet ought to be spoken to, that that which is not right may be distinguished from that that is.","There is, I say, several sorts or kinds of fear in the hearts of the sons of men, I mean besides that fear of God that is intended in the text, and that accompanieth eternal life.",I shall here make mention of three of them.,FIRST.,There is a fear of God that flows even from the light of nature.,SECOND.,"There is a fear of God that flows from some of his dispensations to men, which yet is neither universal nor saving.",THIRD.,"There is a fear of God in the heart of some men that is good and godly, but doth not for ever abide so.","To speak a little to all these, before I come to speak of fear, as it is a grace of God in the hearts of his children, And, FIRST.","To the first, to wit, that there is a fear of God that flows even from the light of nature.","A people may be said to do things in a fear of God, when they act one towards another in things reasonable, and honest betwixt man and man, not doing that to others they would not have done to themselves.","This is that fear of God which Abraham thought the Philistines had destroyed in themselves, when he said of his wife to Abimelech, ""She is my sister.""","For when Abimelech asked Abraham why he said of his wife, She is my sister; he replied, saying, ""I thought surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wife's sake"" (Gen 20:11).","I thought verily that in this place men had stifled and choked that light of nature that is in them, at least so far forth as not to suffer it to put them in fear, when their lusts were powerful in them to accomplish their ends on the object that was present before them.","But this I will pass by, and come to the second thing, namely-- SECOND.","To show that there is a fear of God that flows from some of his dispensations to men, which yet is neither universal nor saving.","This fear, when opposed to that which is saving, may be called an ungodly fear of God.",I shall describe it by these several particulars that follow-- First.,"There is a fear of God that causeth a continual grudging, discontent, and heart-risings against God under the hand of God; and that is, when the dread of God in his coming upon men, to deal with them for their sins, is apprehended by them, and yet by this dispensation they have no change of heart to submit to God thereunder.","The sinners under this dispensation cannot shake God out of their mind, nor yet graciously tremble before him; but through the unsanctified frame that they now are in, they are afraid with ungodly fear, and so in their minds let fly against him.","This fear oftentimes took hold of the children of Israel when they were in the wilderness in their journey to the promised land; still they feared that God in this place would destroy them, but not with that fear that made them willing to submit, for their sins, to the judgment which they fear, but with that fear that made them let fly against God.","This fear showed itself in them, even at the beginning of their voyage, and was rebuked by Moses at the Red Sea, but it was not there, nor yet at any other place, so subdued, but that it would rise again in them at times to the dishonour of God, and the anew making of them guilty of sin before him (Exo 14:11-13; Num 14:1-9).","This fear is that which God said he would send before them, in the day of Joshua, even a fear that should possess the inhabitants of the land, to wit, a fear that should arise for that faintness of heart that they should be swallowed up of, at their apprehending of Joshua in his approaches towards them to destroy them.","""I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee"" (Exo 23:27).","""This day,"" says God, ""will I begin to put the dread of thee, and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee"" (Deut 2:25, 11:25).","Now this fear is also, as you here see, called anguish, and in another place, an hornet; for it, and the soul that it falls upon, do greet each other, as boys and bees do.","The hornet puts men in fear, not so as to bring the heart into a sweet compliance with his terror, but so as to stir up the spirit into acts of opposition and resistance, yet withal they flee before it.","""I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite,"" &c. (Exo 23:28).","Now this fear, whether it be wrought by misapprehending of the judgments of God, as in the Israelites, or otherwise as in the Canaanites, yet ungodliness is the effect thereof, and therefore I call it an ungodly fear of God, for it stirreth up murmurings, discontents, and heart-risings against God, while he with his dispensations is dealing with them.",Second.,"There is a fear of God that driveth a man away from God--I speak not now of the atheist, nor of the pleasurable sinner, nor yet of these, and that fear that I spoke of just now--I speak now of such who through a sense of sin and of God's justice fly from him of a slavish ungodly fear.","This ungodly fear was that which possessed Adam's heart in the day that he did eat of the tree concerning which the Lord has said unto him, ""In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.""",For then was he possessed with such a fear of God as made him seek to hide himself from his presence.,"""I heard,"" said he, ""thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself"" (Gen 3:10).","Mind it, he had a fear of God, but it was not godly.","It was not that that made him afterwards submit himself unto him; for that would have kept him from not departing from him, or else have brought him to him again, with bowed, broken, and contrite spirit.","But this fear, as the rest of his sin, managed his departing from his God, and pursued him to provoke him still so to do; by it he kept himself from God, by it his whole man was carried away from him.","I call it ungodly fear, because it begat in him ungodly apprehensions of his Maker; because it confined Adam's conscience to the sense of justice only, and consequently to despair.","The same fear also possessed the children of Israel when they heard the law delivered to them on Mount Sinai; as is evident, for it made them that they could neither abide his presence nor hear his word.",It drove them back from the mountain.,"It made them, saith the apostle to the Hebrews, that ""they could not endure that which was commanded"" (Heb 12:20).","Wherefore this fear Moses rebukes, and forbids their giving way thereto.","""Fear not,"" said he; but had that fear been godly, he would have encouraged it, and not forbid and rebuke it as he did.","""Fear not,"" said he, ""for God is come to prove you""; they thought otherwise.","""God,"" saith he, ""is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces.""","Therefore that fear that already had taken possession of them, was not the fear of God, but a fear that was of Satan, of their own misjudging hearts, and so a fear that was ungodly (Exo 20:18-20).","Mark you, here is a fear and a fear, a fear forbidden, and a fear commended; a fear forbidden, because it engendered their hearts to bondage, and to ungodly thoughts of God and of his word; it made them that they could not desire to hear God speak to them any more (vv 19-21).","Many also at this day are possessed with this ungodly fear; and you may know them by this,--they cannot abide conviction for sin, and if at any time the word of the law, by the preaching of the word, comes near them, they will not abide that preacher, nor such kind of sermons any more.","They are, as they deem, best at ease, when furthest off of God, and of the power of his word.","The word preached brings God nearer to them than they desire he should come, because whenever God comes near, their sins by him are manifest, and so is the judgment too that to them is due.","Now these not having faith in the mercy of God through Christ, nor that grace that tendeth to bring them to him, they cannot but think of God amiss, and their so thinking of him makes them say unto him, ""Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways"" (Job 21:14).","Wherefore their wrong thoughts of God beget in them this ungodly fear; and again, this ungodly fear doth maintain in them the continuance of these wrong and unworthy thoughts of God, and therefore, through that devilish service wherewith they strengthen one another, the sinner, without a miracle of grace prevents him, is drowned in destruction and perdition.","It was this ungodly fear of God that carried Cain from the presence of God into the land of Nod, and that put him there upon any carnal worldly business, if perhaps he might by so doing stifle convictions of the majesty and justice of God against his sin, and so live the rest of his vain life in the more sinful security and fleshly ease.","This ungodly fear is that also which Samuel perceived at the people's apprehension of their sin, to begin to get hold of their hearts; wherefore he, as Moses before him, quickly forbids their entertaining of it.","""Fear not,"" said he, ""ye have done all this wickedness, yet turn not aside from following the Lord.""","For to turn them aside from following of him, was the natural tendency of this fear.","""But fear not,"" said he, that is, with that fear that tendeth to turn you aside.","Now, I say, the matter that this fear worketh upon, as in Adam, and the Israelites mentioned before, was their sin.","You have sinned, says he, that is true, yet turn not aside, yet fear not with that fear that would make you so do (1 Sam 12:20).","Note by the way, sinner, that when the greatness of thy sins, being apprehended by thee, shall work in thee that fear of God, as shall incline thy heart to fly from him, thou art possessed with a fear of God that is ungodly, yea, so ungodly, that not any of thy sins for heinousness may be compared therewith, as might be made manifest in many particulars, but Samuel having rebuked this fear, presently sets before the people another, to wit, the true fear of God; ""fear the Lord,"" says he, ""serve him--with all your heart"" (v 24).","And he giveth them this encouragement so to do, ""for the Lord will not forsake his people.""","This ungodly fear is that which you read of in Isaiah 2, and in many other places, and God's people should shun it, as they would shun the devil, because its natural tendency is to forward the destruction of the soul in which it has taken possession.",[8] Third.,"There is a fear of God, which, although it hath not in it that power as to make men flee from God's presence, yet it is ungodly, because, even while they are in the outward way of God's ordinances, their hearts are by it quite discouraged from attempting to exercise themselves in the power of religion.","Of this sort are they which dare not cast off the hearing, reading, and discourse of the word as others; no, nor the assembly of God's children for the exercise of other religious duties, for their conscience is convinced this is the way and worship of God.","But yet their heart, as I said, by this ungodly fear, is kept from a powerful gracious falling in with God.","This fear takes away their heart from all holy and godly prayer in private, and from all holy and godly zeal for his name in public, and there be many professors whose hearts are possessed with this ungodly fear of God; and they are intended by the slothful one.","He was a servant, a servant among the servants of God, and had gifts and abilities given him, therewith to serve Christ, as well as his fellows, yea, and was commanded too, as well as the rest, to occupy till his master came.",But what does he?,"Why, he takes his talent, the gift that he was to lay out for his master's profit, and puts it in a napkin, digs a hole in the earth, and hides his lord's money, and lies in a lazy manner at to-elbow all his days, not out of, but in his lord's vineyard;[9] for he came among the servants also at last.","By which it is manifest that he had not cast off his profession, but was slothful and negligent while he was in it.",But what was it that made him thus slothful?,"What was it that took away his heart, while he was in the way, and that discouraged him from falling in with the power and holy practice of religion according to the talent he received?","Why, it was this, he gave way to an ungodly fear of God, and that took away his heart from the power of religious duties.","""Lord,"" said he, ""behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept, laid up in a napkin, for I feared thee.""","Why, man, doth the fear of God make a man idle and slothful?","No, no; that is, if it be right and godly.",This fear was therefore evil fear; it was that ungodly fear of God which I have here been speaking of.,"For I feared thee, or as Matthew hath it, ""for I was afraid.""",Afraid of what?,"Of Christ, ""that he was an hard man, reaping where he sowed not, and gathering where he had not strawed.""","This his fear, being ungodly, made him apprehend of Christ contrary to the goodness of his nature, and so took away his heart from all endeavours to be doing of that which was pleasing in his sight (Luke 19:20; Matt 25:24, 25).","And thus do all those that retain the name and show of religion, but are neglecters as to the power and godly practice of it.","These will live like dogs and swine in the house; they pray not, they watch not their hearts, they pull not their hands out of their bosoms to work, they do not strive against their lusts, nor will they ever resist unto blood, striving against sin; they cannot take up their cross, or improve what they have to God's glory.","Let all men therefore take heed of this ungodly fear, and shun it as they shun the devil, for it will make them afraid where no fear is.","It will tell them that there is a lion in the street, the unlikeliest place in the world for such a beast to be in; it will put a vizard upon the face of God, most dreadful and fearful to behold, and then quite discourage the soul as to his service; so it served the slothful servant, and so it will serve thee, poor sinner, if thou entertainest it, and givest way thereto.","But, Fourth.",This ungodly fear of God shows itself also in this.,"It will not suffer the soul that is governed thereby to trust only to Christ for justification of life, but will bend the powers of the soul to trust partly to the works of the law.","Many of the Jews were, in the time of Christ and his apostles, possessed with this ungodly fear of God, for they were not as the former, to wit, as the slothful servant, to receive a talent and hide it in the earth in a napkin, but they were an industrious people, they followed after the law of righteousness, they had a zeal of God and of the religion of their fathers; but how then did they come to miscarry?","Why, their fear of God was ungodly; it would not suffer them wholly to trust to the righteousness of faith, which is the imputed righteousness of Christ.","They followed after the law of righteousness, but attained not to the law of righteousness.",Wherefore?,"because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law.","But what was it that made them join their works of the law with Christ, but their unbelief, whose foundation was ignorance and fear?","They were afraid to venture all in one bottom, they thought two strings to one bow would be best, and thus betwixt two stools they came to the ground.","And hence, to fear and to doubt, are put together as being the cause one of another; yea, they are put ofttimes the one for the other; thus ungodly fear for unbelief: ""Be not afraid, only believe,"" and therefore he that is overruled and carried away with this fear, is coupled with the unbeliever that is thrust out from the holy city among the dogs.","But the fearful and unbelievers, and murderers are without (Rev 21:8).","""The fearful and unbelieving,"" you see, are put together; for indeed fear, that is, this ungodly fear, is the ground of unbelief, or, if you will, unbelief is the ground of fear, this fear: but I stand not upon nice distinctions.",This ungodly fear hath a great hand in keeping of the soul from trusting only to Christ's righteousness for justification of life.,Fifth.,"This ungodly fear of God is that which will put men upon adding to the revealed will of God their own inventions, and their own performances of them, as a means to pacify the anger of God.","For the truth is, where this ungodly fear reigneth, there is no end of law and duty.","When those that you read of in the book of Kings were destroyed by the lions, because they had set up idolatry in the land of Israel, they sent for a priest from Babylon that might teach them the manner of the God of the land; but behold when they knew it, being taught it by the priest, yet their fear would not suffer them to be content with that worship only.","""They feared the Lord,"" saith the text, ""and served their own gods.""","And again, ""So these nations feared the Lord, and served their graven images"" (2 Kings 17).","It was this fear also that put the Pharisees upon inventing so many traditions, as the washing of cups, and beds, and tables, and basins, with abundance of such other like gear,[10] none knows the many dangers that an ungodly fear of God will drive a man into (Mark 7).",How has it racked and tortured the Papists for hundreds of years together!,"for what else is the cause but this ungodly fear, at least in the most simple and harmless of them, of their penances, as creeping to the cross, going barefoot on pilgrimage, whipping themselves, wearing of sackcloth, saying so many Pater-nosters, so many Ave-marias, making so many confessions to the priest, giving so much money for pardons, and abundance of other the like, but this ungodly fear of God?","For could they be brought to believe this doctrine, that Christ was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification, and to apply it by faith with godly boldness to their own souls, this fear would vanish, and so consequently all those things with which they so needlessly and unprofitably afflicted themselves, offend God, and grieve his people.","Therefore, gentle reader, although my text doth bid that indeed thou shouldest fear God, yet it includeth not, nor accepteth of any fear; no, not of any [or every] fear of God.","For there is, as you see, a fear of God that is ungodly, and that is to be shunned as their sin.","Wherefore thy wisdom and thy care should be, to see and prove thy fear to be godly, which shall be the next thing that I shall take in hand.",THIRD.,"The third thing that I am to speak to is, that there is a fear of God in the heart of some men that is good and godly, but yet doth not for ever abide so.",Or you may take it thus--There is a fear of God that is godly but for a time.,"In my speaking to, and opening of this to you, I shall observe this method.",First.,I shall show you what this fear is.,Second.,I shall show you by whom or what this fear is wrought in the heart.,Third.,I shall show you what this fear doth in the soul.,"And, Fourth, I shall show you when this fear is to have an end.",First.,"For the first, this fear is an effect of sound awakenings by the word of wrath which begetteth in the soul a sense of its right to eternal damnation; for this fear is not in every sinner; he that is blinded by the devil, and that is not able to see that his state is damnable, he hath not this fear in his heart, but he that is under the powerful workings of the word of wrath, as God's elect are at first conversion, he hath this godly fear in his heart; that is, he fears that that damnation will come upon him, which by the justice of God is due unto him, because he hath broken his holy law.","This is the fear that made the three thousand cry out, ""Men and brethren, what shall we do?""","and that made the jailer cry out, and that with great trembling of soul, ""Sirs, what must I do to be saved?""","(Acts 2, 16).","The method of God is to kill and make alive, to smite and then heal; when the commandment came to Paul, sin revived, and he died, and that law which was ordained to life, he found to be unto death; that is, it passed a sentence of death upon him for his sins, and slew his conscience with that sentence.","Therefore from that time that he heard that word, ""Why persecutest thou me?""","which is all one as if he had said, Why dost thou commit murder?","he lay under the sentence of condemnation by the law, and under this fear of that sentence in his conscience.","He lay, I say, under it, until that Ananias came to him to comfort him, and to preach unto him the forgiveness of sin (Acts 9).","The fear therefore that now I call godly, it is that fear which is properly called the fear of eternal damnation for sin, and this fear, at first awakening, is good and godly, because it ariseth in the soul from a true sense of its very state.","Its state by nature is damnable, because it is sinful, and because he is not one that as yet believeth in Christ for remission of sins: ""He that believeth not shall be damned.""","--""He that believeth not is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on him"" (Mark 16:16; John 3:18,36).","The which when the sinner at first begins to see, he justly fears it; I say, he fears it justly, and therefore godly, because by this fear he subscribes to the sentence that is gone out against him for sin.",Second.,By whom or by what is this fear wrought in the heart?,To this I shall answer in brief.,"It is wrought in the heart by the Spirit of God, working there at first as a spirit of bondage, on purpose to put us in fear.","This Paul insinuateth, saying, ""Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear"" (Rom 8:15).","He doth not say, Ye have not received the spirit of bondage; for that they had received, and that to put them in fear, which was at their first conversion, as by the instances made mention of before is manifest; all that he says is, that they had not received it again, that is, after the Spirit, as a spirit of adoption, is come; for then, as a spirit of bondage, it cometh no more.","It is then the Spirit of God, even the Holy Ghost, that convinceth us of sin, and so of our damnable state because of sin (John 16:8,9).","For it cannot be that the Spirit of God should convince us of sin, but it must also show us our state to be damnable because of it, especially if it so convinceth us, before we believe, and that is the intent of our Lord in that place, ""of sin,"" and so of their damnable state by sin, because they believe not on me.","Therefore the Spirit of God, when he worketh in the heart as a spirit of bondage, he doth it by working in us by the law, ""for by the law is the knowledge of sin"" (Rom 3:20).","And he, in this his working, is properly called a spirit of bondage.",1.,"Because by the law he shows us that indeed we are in bondage to the law, the devil, and death and damnation; for this is our proper state by nature, though we see it not until the Spirit of God shall come to reveal this our state of bondage unto our own senses by revealing to us our sins by the law.",2.,"He is called, in this his working, ""the spirit of bondage,"" because he here also holds us; to wit, in this sight and sense of our bondage-state, so long as is meet we should be so held, which to some of the saints is a longer, and to some a shorter time.","Paul was held in it three days and three nights, but the jailer and the three thousand, so far as can be gathered, not above an hour; but some in these later times are so held for days and months, if not years.","[11] But, I say, let the time be longer or shorter, it is the Spirit of God that holdeth him under this yoke; and it is good that a man should be in HIS time held under it, as is that saying of the lamentation, ""It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth"" (Lam 3:27).","That is, at his first awakening; so long as seems good to this Holy Spirit to work in this manner by the law.","Now, as I said, the sinner at first is by the Spirit of God held in this bondage, that is, hath such a discovery of his sin and of his damnation for sin made to him, and also is held so fast under the sense thereof, that it is not in the power of any man, nor yet of the very angels in heaven, to release him or set him free, until the Holy Spirit changeth his ministration, and comes in the sweet and peaceable tidings of salvation by Christ in the gospel to his poor, dejected, and afflicted conscience.",Third.,I now come to show you what this fear doth in the soul.,"Now, although this godly fear is not to last always with us, as I shall further show you anon, yet it greatly differs from that which is wholly ungodly of itself, both because of the author, and also of the effects of it.",Of the author I have told you before; I now shall tell you what it doth.,1.,"This fear makes a man judge himself for sin, and to fall down before God with a broken mind under this judgment; the which is pleasing to God, because the sinner by so doing justifies God in his saying, and clears him in his judgment (Psa 51:1-4).",2.,"As this fear makes a man judge himself, and cast himself down at God's foot, so it makes him condole and bewail his misery before him, which is also well-pleasing in his sight: ""I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself,"" saying, ""Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke,"" &c. (Jer 31:18,19).",3.,"This fear makes a man lie at God's foot, and puts his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.","This also is well-pleasing to God, because now is the sinner as nothing, and in his own eyes less than nothing, as to any good or desert: ""He sitteth alone and keepeth silence,"" because he hath now this yoke upon him; ""he putteth his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope"" (Lam 3:28,29).",4.,"This fear puts a man upon crying to God for mercy, and that in most humble manner; now he sensibly cries, now he dejectedly cries, now he feels and cries, now he smarts and criest out, ""God be merciful to me a sinner"" (Luke 18:13).",5.,"This fear makes a man that he cannot accept of that for support and succour which others that are destitute thereof will take up, and be contented with.","This man must be washed by God himself, and cleansed from his sin by God himself (Psa 51).",6.,"Therefore this fear goes not away until the Spirit of God doth change his ministration as to this particular, in leaving off to work now by the law, as afore, and coming to the soul with the sweet word of promise of life and salvation by Jesus Christ.","Thus far this fear is godly, that is, until Christ by the Spirit in the gospel is revealed and made over unto us, and no longer.","Thus far this fear is godly, and the reason why it is godly is because the groundwork of it is good.","I told you before what this fear is; namely, it is the fear of damnation.","Now the ground for this fear is good, as is manifest by these particulars.",1.,"The soul feareth damnation, and that rightly, because it is in its sins.",2.,"The soul feareth damnation rightly, because it hath not faith in Christ, but is at present under the law.",3.,"The soul feareth damnation rightly now, because by sin, the law, and for want of faith, the wrath of God abideth on it.","But now, although thus far this fear of God is good and godly, yet after Christ by the Spirit in the word of the gospel is revealed to us, and we made to accept of him as so revealed and offered to us by a true and living faith; this fear, to wit, of damnation, is no longer good, but ungodly.",Nor doth the Spirit of God ever work it in us again.,"Now we do not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, that is to say, to fear damnation, but we have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Father, Father.","But I would not be mistaken, when I say, that this fear is no longer godly.","I do not mean with reference to the essence and habit of it, for I believe it is the same in the seed which shall afterwards grow up to a higher degree, and into a more sweet and gospel current and manner of working, but I mean reference to this act of fearing damnation, I say it shall never by the Spirit be managed to that work; it shall never bring forth that fruit more.","And my reasons are, [Reasons why the Spirit of God cannot work this ungodly fear.]",1.,"Because that the soul by closing through the promise, by the Spirit, with Jesus Christ, is removed off of that foundation upon which it stood when it justly feared damnation.","It hath received now forgiveness of sin, it is now no more under the law, but in Jesus Christ by faith; there is ""therefore now no condemnation to it"" (Acts 26:18; Rom 6:14, 8:1).","The groundwork, therefore, being now taken away, the Spirit worketh that fear no more.",2.,"He cannot, after he hath come to the soul as a spirit of adoption, come again as a spirit of bondage to put the soul into his first fear; to wit, a fear of eternal damnation, because he cannot say and unsay, do and undo.","As a spirit of adoption he told me that my sins were forgiven me, that I was included in the covenant of grace, that God was my Father through Christ, that I was under the promise of salvation, and that this calling and gift of God to me is permanent, and without repentance.","And do you think, that after he hath told me this, and sealed up the truth of it to my precious soul, that he will come to me, and tell me that I am yet in my sins, under the curse of the law and the eternal wrath of God?","No, no, the word of the gospel is not yea, yea; nay, nay.","It is only yea, and amen; it is so, ""as God is true"" (2 Cor 1:17-20).",3.,"The state therefore of the sinner being changed, and that, too, by the Spirit's changing his dispensation, leaving off to be now as a spirit of bondage to put us in fear, and coming to our heart as the spirit of adoption to make us cry, Father, Father, he cannot go back to his first work again; for if so, then he must gratify, yea, and also ratify, that profane and popish doctrine, forgiven to-day, unforgiven to-morrow--a child of God to-day, a child of hell to-morrow; but what saith the Scriptures?","""Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord; in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit"" (Eph 2:19-22).",Object.,But this is contrary to my experience.,"Why, Christian, what is thy experience?","Why, I was at first, as you have said, possessed with a fear of damnation, and so under the power of the spirit of bondage.","Well said, and how was it then?","Why, after some time of continuance in these fears, I had the spirit of adoption sent to me to seal up to my soul the forgiveness of sins, and so he did; and was also helped by the same Spirit, as you have said, to call God Father, Father.","Well said, and what after that?","Why, after that I fell into as great fears as ever I was in before.",[12] Answ.,"All this may be granted, and yet nevertheless what I have said will abide a truth; for I have not said that after the spirit of adoption is come, a Christian shall not again be in as great fears, for he may have worse than he had at first; but I say, that after the spirit of adoption is come, the spirit of bondage, as such, is sent of God no more, to put us into those fears.","For, mark, for we ""have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear.""","Let the word be true, whatever thy experience is.",Dost thou not understand me?,"After the Spirit of God has told me, and also helped me to believe it, that the Lord for Christ's sake hath forgiven mine iniquities: he tells me no more that they are not forgiven.","After the Spirit of God has helped me, by Christ, to call God my Father, he tells me no more that the devil is my father.","After he hath told me that I am not under the law, but under grace, he tells me no more that I am not under grace, but under the law, and bound over by it, for my sins, to the wrath and judgment of God; but this is the fear that the Spirit, as a spirit of bondage, worketh in the soul at first.",Quest.,Can you give me further reason yet to convict me of the truth of what you say?,Answ.,Yes.,1.,"Because as the Spirit cannot give himself the lie, so he cannot overthrow his own order of working, nor yet contradict that testimony that his servants, by his inspiration, hath given of his order of working with them.","But he must do the first, if he saith to us--and that after we have received his own testimony, that we are under grace--that yet we are under sin, the law, and wrath.","And he must do the second, if--after he hath gone through the first work on us as a spirit of bondage, to the second as a spirit of adoption--he should overthrow as a spirit of bondage again what before he had built as a spirit of adoption.","And the third must therefore needs follow, that is, he overthroweth the testimony of his servants; for they have said, that now we receive the spirit of bondage again to fear no more; that is, after that we by the Holy Ghost are enabled to call God Father, Father.",2.,"This is evident also, because the covenant in which now the soul is interested abideth, and is everlasting, not upon the supposition of my obedience, but upon the unchangeable purpose of God, and the efficacy of the obedience of Christ, whose blood also hath confirmed it.","It is ""ordered in all things, and sure,"" said David; and this, said he, ""is all my salvation"" (2 Sam 23:5).","The covenant then is everlasting in itself, being established upon so good a foundation, and therefore standeth in itself everlastingly bent for the good of them that are involved in it.","Hear the tenor of the covenant, and God's attesting of the truth thereof--""This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people; and they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest; for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more"" (Heb 8:10-12).","Now if God will do thus unto those that he hath comprised in his everlasting covenant of grace, then he will remember their sins no more, that is, unto condemnation--for so it is that he doth forget them;

and whether now, since the spirit of adoption is come unto thee, and hath thee, and hath done that for thee as hath been mentioned; I say, whether thou oughtest for anything whatsoever to give way to the same fear, from the same ground of damnation;

for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; that is, God hath not given it us, ""for God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind"" (2 Tim 1:7).","If, therefore, our first fears come upon us again, after that we have received at God's hands the spirit of love, of power, and of a sound mind, it is to be refused, though we have grievously sinned against our God.","This is manifest from 1 Samuel 12:20; ""Fear not; ye have done all this wickedness.""","That is, not with that fear which would have made them fly from God, as concluding that they were not now his people.","And the reason is, because sin cannot dissolve the covenant into which the sons of God, by his grace, are taken.","""If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I visit their transgressions with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.","Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail"" (Psa 89:30-33).","Now, if sin doth not dissolve the covenant; if sin doth not cast me out of this covenant, which is made personally with the Son of God, and into the hands of which by the grace of God I am put, then ought I not, though I have sinned, to fear with my first fears.","Sin, after that the spirit of adoption is come, cannot dissolve the relation of Father and son, of Father and child.","And this the church did rightly assert, and that when her heart was under great hardness, and when she had the guilt of erring from his ways, saith she.","""Doubtless thou art our Father"" (Isa 63:16,17).","Doubtless thou art, though this be our case, and though Israel should not acknowledge us for such.","That sin dissolveth not the relation of Father and son is further evident--""When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.","And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, [Abba, or] Father, Father.""","Now mark, ""wherefore thou art no more a servant""; that is, no more under the law of death and damnation, ""but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ"" (Gal 4:4-7).","Suppose a child doth grievously transgress against and offend his father, is the relation between them therefore dissolved?","Again, suppose the father should scourge and chasten the son for such offence, is the relation between them therefore dissolved?","Yea, suppose the child should now, through ignorance, cry, and say, This man is now no more my father; is he, therefore, now no more his father?",Doth not everybody see the folly of such arguings?,"Why, of the same nature is that doctrine that saith, that after we have received the spirit of adoption, that the spirit of bondage is sent to us again to put us in fear of eternal damnation.","Know then that thy sin, after thou hast received the spirit of adoption to cry unto God, Father, Father, is counted the transgression of a child, not of a slave, and that all that happeneth to thee for that transgression is but the chastisement of a father--and ""what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?""","It is worth your observation, that the Holy Ghost checks those who, under their chastisements for sin, forget to call God their Father--""Ye have,"" said Paul, ""forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.""","Yea, observe yet further, that God's chastising of his children for their sin, is a a sign of grace and love, and not of his wrath, and thy damnation; therefore now there is no ground for the aforesaid fear--""For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth"" (Heb 12).","Now, if God would not have those that have received the Spirit of the Son, however he chastises them, to forget the relation that by the adoption of sons they stand in to God, if he checks them that do forget it, when his rod is upon their backs for sin, then it is evident that those fears that thou hast under a colour of the coming again of the Spirit, as a spirit of bondage, to put thee in fear of eternal damnation, is nothing else but Satan disguised, the better to play his pranks upon thee.","I will yet give you two or three instances more, wherein it will be manifest that whatever happeneth to thee, I mean as a chastisement for sin, after the spirit of adoption is come, thou oughtest to hold fast by faith the relation of Father and son.","The people spoken of by Moses are said to have lightly esteemed the rock of their salvation, which rock is Jesus Christ, and that is a grievous sin indeed, yet, saith he, ""Is not God thy Father that hath bought thee?""",and then puts them upon considering the days of old (Deut 32:6).,"They in the prophet Jeremiah had played the harlot with many lovers, and done evil things as they could; and, as another scripture hath it, gone a-whoring from under their God, yet God calls to them by the prophet, saying, ""Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth?""",(Jer 3:4).,"Remember also that eminent text made mention of in 1 Samuel 12:20, ""Fear not; ye have done all this wickedness""; and labour to maintain faith in thy soul, of thy being a child, it being true that thou hast received the spirit of adoption before, and so that thou oughtest not to fall under thy first fears, because the ground is taken away, of thy eternal damnation.","Now, let not any, from what hath been said, take courage to live loose lives, under a supposition that once in Christ, and ever in Christ, and the covenant cannot be broken, nor the relation of Father and child dissolved; for they that do so, it is evident, have not known what it is to receive the spirit of adoption.","It is the spirit of the devil in his own hue that suggesteth this unto them, and that prevaileth with them to do so.",Shall we do evil that good may come?,shall we sin that grace may abound?,or shall we be base in life because God by grace hath secured us from wrath to come?,"God forbid; these conclusions betoken one void of the fear of God indeed, and of the spirit of adoption too.","For what son is he, that because the father cannot break the relation, nor suffer sin to do it--that is, betwixt the Father and him--that will therefore say, I will live altogether after my own lusts, I will labour to be a continual grief to my Father?",[Considerations to prevent such temptations.],"Yet lest the devil (for some are ""not ignorant of his devices"" ), should get an advantage against some of the sons, to draw them away from the filial fear of their Father, let me here, to prevent such temptations, present such with these following considerations.",First.,"Though God cannot, will not, dissolve the relation which the spirit of adoption hath made betwixt the Father and the Son, for any sins that such do commit, yet he can, and often doth, take away from them the comfort of their adoption, not suffering children while sinning to have the sweet and comfortable sense thereof on their hearts.","He can tell how to let snares be round about them, and sudden fear trouble them.","He can tell how to send darkness that they may not see, and to let abundance of waters cover them (Job 22:10,11).",Second.,"God can tell how to hide his face from them, and so to afflict them with that dispensation, that it shall not be in the power of all the world to comfort them.","""When he hideth his face, who then can behold him?""","(Job 23:8,9, 34:29).",Third.,"God can tell how to make thee again to possess the sins that he long since hath pardoned, and that in such wise that things shall be bitter to thy soul.","""Thou writest bitter things against me,"" says Job, ""and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.""",By this also he once made David groan and pray against it as an insupportable affliction (Job 13:26;

thou canst not be out of his sight or presence; nor out of the reach of his hand.,"""Fear ye not me?","saith the Lord.""","""Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him?",saith the Lord.,Do not I fill heaven and earth?,"saith the Lord"" (Jer 5:22, 23:24).",4.,"Consider that he is holy, and cannot look with liking upon the sins of his own people.","Therefore, says Peter, be ""as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance, but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation, because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy.","And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.""",5.,"Consider that he is good, and has been good to thee, good in that he hath singled thee out from others, and saved thee from their death and hell, though thou perhaps wast worse in thy life than those that he left when he laid hold on thee.",O this should engage thy heart to fear the Lord all the days of thy life.,"They ""shall fear the Lord, and his goodness in the latter days"" (Hosea 3:5).","And now for the present, I have done with that fear, I mean as to its first workings, to wit, to put me in fear of damnation, and shall come, in the next place, to treat OF THE GRACE OF FEAR MORE IMMEDIATELY INTENDED IN THE TEXT.","I shall now speak to this fear, which I call a lasting godly fear; first, by way of explication; by which I shall show, FIRST.",How by the Scripture it is described.,SECOND.,I shall show you what this fear flows from.,"And then, THIRD.",I shall also show you what doth flow from it.,[How this Fear is described by the Scripture.],FIRST.,"For the first of these, to wit, how by the Scripture this fear is described; and that, First.",More generally.,Second.,More particularly.,First.,More generally.,1.,"It is called a grace, that is, a sweet and blessed work of the Spirit of grace, as he is given to the elect by God.","Hence the apostle says, ""let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear"" (Heb 12:28).","For as that fear that brings bondage is wrought in the soul by the Spirit as a spirit of bondage, so this fear, which is a fear that we have while we are in the liberty of sons, is wrought by him as he manifesteth to us our liberty; ""where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,"" that is, where he is as a spirit of adoption, setting the soul free from that bondage under which it was held by the same Spirit while he wrought as a spirit of bondage.","Hence as he is called a spirit working bondage to fear, so he, as the Spirit of the Son and of adoption, is called ""the Spirit of the fear of the Lord"" (Isa 11:2).","Because it is that Spirit of grace that is the author, animater, and maintainer of our filial fear, or of that fear that is son-like, and that subjecteth the elect unto God, his word, and ways; unto him, his word, and ways, as a Father.",2.,"This fear is called also the fear of God, not as that which is ungodly is, nor yet as that may be which is wrought by the Spirit as a spirit of bondage, but by way of eminency; to wit, as a dispensation of the grace of the gospel, and as a fruit of eternal love.","""I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me"" (Jer 32:38-41).",3.,"This fear of God is called God's treasure, for it is one of his choice jewels, it is one of the rarities of heaven, ""The fear of the Lord is his treasure"" (Isa 33:6).","And it may well go under such a title; for as treasure, so the fear of the Lord is not found in every corner.","It is said all men have not faith, because that also is more precious than gold; the same is said about this fear--""There is no fear of God before their eyes""; that is, the greatest part of men are utterly destitute of this godly jewel, this treasure, the fear of the Lord.","Poor vagrants, when they come straggling to a lord's house, may perhaps obtain some scraps and fragments, they may also obtain old shoes, and some sorry cast-off rags, but they get not any of his jewels, they may not touch his choicest treasure; that is kept for the children, and those that shall be his heirs.","We may say the same also of this blessed grace of fear, which is called here God's treasure.","It is only bestowed upon the elect, the heirs and children of the promise; all others are destitute of it, and so continue to death and judgment.",4.,"This grace of fear is that which maketh men excel and go beyond all men, in the account of God; it is that which beautifies a man, and prefers him above all other; ""Hast thou,"" says God to Satan, ""considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?""","(Job 1:8, 2:3).","Mind it, ""There is none like him, none alike him in the earth.""","I suppose he means either [that Job was the only most perfect and upright man] in those parts, or else he was the man that abounded in the fear of the Lord; none like him to fear the Lord, he only excelled others with respect to his reverencing of God, bowing before him, and sincerely complying with his will; and therefore is counted the excellent man.","It is not the knowledge of the will of God, but our sincere complying therewith, that proveth we fear the Lord; and it is our so doing that putteth upon us the note of excelling; hereby appears our perfection, herein is manifest our uprightness.","A perfect and an upright man is one that feareth God, and that because he escheweth evil.","Therefore this grace of fear is that without which no part or piece of service which we do to God, can be accepted of him.","It is, as I may call it, the salt of the covenant, which seasoneth the heart, and therefore must not be lacking there; it is also that which salteth, or seasoneth all our doings, and therefore must not be lacking in any of them (Lev 2:13).",5.,"I take this grace of fear to be that which softeneth and mollifieth the heart, and that makes it stand in awe both of the mercies and judgments of God.","This is that that retaineth in the heart that due dread, and reverence of the heavenly majesty, that is meet should be both in, and kept in the heart of poor sinners.","Wherefore when David described this fear, in the exercise of it, he calls it an awe of God.","""Stand in awe,"" saith he, ""and sin not""; and again, ""my heart standeth in awe of thy word""; and again, ""Let all the earth fear the Lord""; what is that?",or how is that?,why?,"""Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him"" (Psa 4:4, 119:161, 33:8).","This is that therefore that is, as I said before, so excellent a thing in the eyes of God, to wit, a grace of the Spirit, the fear of God, his treasure, the salt of the covenant, that which makes men excel all others; for it is that which maketh the sinner to stand in awe of God, which posture is the most comely thing in us, throughout all ages.","But, Second.",And more particularly.,1.,"This grace is called ""the beginning of knowledge,"" because by the first gracious discovery of God to the soul, this grace is begot: and again, because the first time that the soul doth apprehend God in Christ to be good unto it, this grace is animated, by which the soul is put into an holy awe of God, which causeth it with reverence and due attention to hearken to him, and tremble before him (Prov 1:7).",It is also by virtue of this fear that the soul doth inquire yet more after the blessed knowledge of God.,"This is the more evident, because, where this fear of God is wanting, or where the discovery of God is not attended with it, the heart still abides rebellious, obstinate, and unwilling to know more, that it might comply therewith; nay, for want of it, such sinners say rather, As for God, let him ""depart from us,"" and for the Almighty, ""we desire not the knowledge of his ways.""",2.,"This fear is called ""the beginning of wisdom,"" because then, and not till then, a man begins to be truly spiritually wise; what wisdom is there where the fear of God is not?",(Job 28:28; Psa 111:10).,"Therefore the fools are described thus, ""For that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord"" (Prov 1:29).","The Word of God is the fountain of knowledge, into which a man will not with godly reverence look, until he is endued with the fear of the Lord.","Therefore it is rightly called ""the beginning of knowledge; but fools despise wisdom and instruction"" (Prov 1:7).","It is therefore this fear of the Lord that makes a man wise for his soul, for life, and for another world.","It is this that teacheth him how he should do to escape those spiritual and eternal ruins that the fool is overtaken with, and swallowed up of for ever.","A man void of this fear of God, wherever he is wise, or in whatever he excels, yet about the matters of his soul, there is none more foolish than himself; for through the want of the fear of the Lord, he leaves the best things at sixes and sevens, and only pursueth with all his heart those that will leave him in the snare when he dies.",3.,This fear of the Lord is to hate evil.,To hate sin and vanity.,"Sin and vanity, they are the sweet morsels of the fool, and such which the carnal appetite of the flesh runs after; and it is only the virtue that is in the fear of the Lord that maketh the sinner have an antipathy against it (Job 20:12).","""By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil"" (Prov 16:6).","That is, men shun, separate themselves from, and eschew it in its appearances.","Wherefore it is plain that those that love evil, are not possessed with the fear of God.","There is a generation that will pursue evil, that will take it in, nourish it, lay it up in their hearts, hide it, and plead for it, and rejoice to do it.","These cannot have in them the fear of the Lord, for that is to hate it, and to make men depart from it: where the fear of God and sin is, it will be with the soul, as it was with Israel when Omri and Tibni strove to reign among them both at once, one of them must be put to death, they cannot live together (see 1 Kings 16): sin must down, for the fear of the Lord begetteth in the soul a hatred against it, an abhorrence of it, therefore sin must die, that is, as to the affections and lusts of it; for as Solomon says in another case, ""where no wood is, the fire goeth out.""","So we may say, where there is a hatred of sin, and where men depart from it, there it loseth much of its power, waxeth feeble, and decayeth.","Therefore Solomon saith again, ""Fear the Lord, and depart from evil"" (Prov 3:7).","As who should say, Fear the Lord, and it will follow that you shall depart from evil: departing from evil is a natural consequence, a proper effect of the fear of the Lord where it is.","By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil, that is, in their judgment, will, mind, and affections.","Not that by the fear of the Lord sin is annihilated, or has lost its being in the soul; there still will those Canaanites be, but they are hated, loathed, abominated, fought against, prayed against, watched against, striven against, and mortified by the soul (Rom 7).",4.,"This fear is called a fountain of life--""The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death"" (Prov 14:27).","It is a fountain, or spring, which so continually supplieth the soul with variety of considerations of sin, of God, of death, and life eternal, as to keep the soul in continual exercise of virtue and in holy contemplation.","It is a fountain of life; every operation thereof, every act and exercise thereof, hath a true and natural tendency to spiritual and eternal felicity.","Wherefore the wise man saith in another place, ""The fear of the Lord tendeth to life, and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil"" (Prov 19:23).","It tendeth to life; even as of nature, everything hath a tendency to that which is most natural to itself; the fire to burn, the water to wet, the stone to fall, the sun to shine, sin to defile, &c. Thus I say, the fear of the Lord tendeth to life; the nature of it is to put the soul upon fearing of God, of closing with Christ, and of walking humbly before him.","""It is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.""","What are the snares of death, but sin, the wiles of the devil, &c. From which the fear of God hath a natural tendency to deliver thee, and to keep thee in the way that tendeth to life.",5.,"This fear of the Lord, it is called ""the instruction of wisdom"" (Prov 15:33).","You heard before that it is the beginning of wisdom, but here you find it called the instruction of wisdom; for indeed it is not only that which makes a man begin to be wise, but to improve, and make advantage of all those helps and means to life, which God hath afforded to that end; that is, both to his own, and his neighbour's salvation also.","It is the instruction of wisdom; it will make a man capable to use all his natural parts, all his natural wisdom to God's glory, and his own good.","There lieth, even in many natural things, that, into which if we were instructed, would yield us a great deal of help to the understanding of spiritual matters; ""For in wisdom has God made all the world""; nor is there anything that God has made, whether in heaven above, or on earth beneath, but there is couched some spiritual mystery in it.","The which men matter no more than they do the ground they tread on, or than the stones that are under their feet, and all because they have not this fear of the Lord; for had they that, that would teach them to think, even from that knowledge of God, that hath by the fear of him put into their hearts, that he being so great and so good, there must needs be abundance of wisdom in the things he hath made: that fear would also endeavour to find out what that wisdom is; yea, and give to the soul the instruction of it.","In that it is called the instruction of wisdom, it intimates to us that its tendency is to keep all even, and in good order in the soul.","When Job perceived that his friends did not deal with him in an even spirit and orderly manner, he said that they forsook ""the fear of the Almighty"" (Job 6:14).",For this fear keeps a man even in his words and judgment of things.,"It may be compared to the ballast of the ship, and to the poise of the balance of the scales; it keeps all even, and also makes us steer our course right with respect to the things that pertain to God and man.",What this fear of God flows from.,SECOND.,"I come now to the second thing, to wit, to show you what this fear of God flows from.",First.,"This fear, this grace of fear, this son-like fear of God, it flows from the distinguishing love of God to his elect.","""I will be their God,"" saith he, ""and I will put my fear in their hearts.""",None other obtain it but those that are enclosed and bound up in that bundle.,"Therefore they, in the same place, are said to be those that are wrapt up in the eternal or everlasting covenant of God, and so designed to be the people that should be blessed with this fear.","""I will make an everlasting covenant with them"" saith God, ""that I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me"" (Jer 32:38-40).","This covenant declares unto men that God hath, in his heart, distinguishing love for some of the children of men; for he saith he will be their God, that he will not leave them, nor yet suffer them to depart, to wit, finally, from him.","Into these men's hearts he doth put his fear, this blessed grace, and this rare and effectual sign of his love, and of their eternal salvation.",Second.,This fear flows from a new heart.,"This fear is not in men by nature; the fear of devils they may have, as also an ungodly fear of God; but this fear is not in any but where there dwelleth a new heart, another fruit and effect of this everlasting covenant, and of this distinguishing love of God.","""A new heart also will I give them""; a new heart, what a one is that?","why, the same prophet saith in another place, ""A heart to fear me,"" a circumcised one, a sanctified one (Jer 32:39; Eze 11:19, 36:26).","So then, until a man receive a heart from God, a heart from heaven, a new heart, he has not this fear of God in him.","New wine must not be put into old bottles, lest the one, to wit, the bottles, mar the wine, or the wine the bottles; but new wine must have new bottles, and then both shall be preserved (Matt 9:17).","This fear of God must not be, cannot be found in old hearts; old hearts are not bottles out of which this fear of God proceeds, but it is from an honest and good heart, from a new one, from such an one that is also an effect of the everlasting covenant, and love of God to men. ""","I will give them one heart"" to fear me; there must in all actions be heart, and without heart no action is good, nor can there be faith, love, or fear, from every kind of heart.","These must flow from such an one, whose nature is to produce, and bring forth such fruit.","Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?","so from a corrupt heart there cannot proceed such fruit as the fear of God, as to believe in God, and love God (Luke 6:43-45).","The heart naturally is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; how then should there flow from such an one the fear of God?",It cannot be.,"He, therefore, that hath not received at the hands of God a new heart, cannot fear the Lord.",Third.,"This fear of God flows from an impression, a sound impression, that the Word of God maketh on our souls; for without an impress of the Word, there is no fear of God.","Hence it is said that God gave to Israel good laws, statutes, and judgments, that they might learn them, and in learning them, learn to fear the Lord their God.","Therefore, saith God, in another place, ""Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn and fear the Lord your God"" (Deut 6:1,2, 31:12).","For as a man drinketh good doctrine into his soul, so he feareth God.","If he drinks it in much, he feareth him greatly; if he drinketh it in but little, he feareth him but little; if he drinketh it not in at all, he feareth him not at all.","This, therefore, teacheth us how to judge who feareth the Lord; they are those that learn, and that stand in awe of the Word.","Those that have by the holy Word of God the very form of itself engraven upon the face of their souls, they fear God (Rom 6:17).","[15] But, on the contrary, those that do not love good doctrine, that give not place to the wholesome truths of the God of heaven, revealed in his Testament, to take place in their souls, but rather despise it, and the true possessors of it, they fear not God.","For, as I said before, this fear of God, it flows from a sound impression that the Word of God maketh upon the soul; and therefore, Fourth.","This godly fear floweth from faith; for where the Word maketh a sound impression on the soul, by that impression is faith begotten, whence also this fear doth flow.","Therefore right hearing of the Word is called ""the hearing of faith"" (Gal 3:2).","Hence it is said again, ""By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house, by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith"" (Heb 11:7).","The Word, the warning that he had from God of things not seen as yet, wrought, through faith therein, that fear of God in his heart that made him prepare against unseen dangers, and that he might be an inheritor of unseen happiness.","Where, therefore, there is not faith in the Word of God, there can be none of this fear; and where the Word doth not make sound impression on the soul, there can be none of this faith.","So that as vices hang together, and have the links of a chain, dependence one upon another, even so the graces of the Spirit also are the fruits of one another, and have such dependence on each other, that the one cannot be without the other.","No faith, no fear of God; devil's faith, devil's fear; saint's faith, saint's fear.",Fifth.,"This godly fear also floweth from sound repentance for and from sin; godly sorrow worketh repentance, and godly repentance produceth this fear--""For behold,"" says Paul, ""this self-same thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you!","yea, what clearing of yourselves!","yea, what indignation!","yea, what fear!""","(2 Cor 7:10,11).","Repentance is the effect of sorrow, and sorrow is the effect of smart, and smart the effect of faith.","Now, therefore, fear must needs be an effect of, and flow from repentance.","Sinner, do not deceive thyself; if thou art a stranger to sound repentance, which standeth in sorrow and shame before God for sin, as also in turning from it, thou hast no fear of God; I mean none of this godly fear; for that is the fruit of, and floweth from, sound repentance.",Sixth.,This godly fear also flows from a sense of the love and kindness of God to the soul.,"Where there is no sense of hope of the kindness and mercy of God by Jesus Christ, there can be none of this fear, but rather wrath and despair, which produceth that fear that is either devilish, or else that which is only wrought in us by the Spirit, as a spirit of bondage; but these we do not discourse of now; wherefore the godly fear that now I treat of, it floweth from some sense or hope of mercy from God by Jesus Christ--""If thou, Lord,"" says David, ""shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?","But there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared"" (Psa 130:3,4).","""There is mercy with thee""; this the soul hath sense of, and hope in, and therefore feareth God.","Indeed nothing can lay a stronger obligation upon the heart to fear God, than sense of, or hope in mercy (Jer 33:8,9).","This begetteth true tenderness of heart, true godly softness of spirit; this truly endeareth the affections to God; and in this true tenderness, softness, and endearedness of affection to God, lieth the very essence of this fear of the Lord, as is manifest by the fruit of this fear when we shall come to speak of it.",Seventh.,"This fear of God flows from a due consideration of the judgments of God that are to be executed in the world; yea, upon professors too.","Yea further, God's people themselves, I mean as to themselves, have such a consideration of his judgments towards them, as to produce this godly fear.","When God's judgments are in the earth, they effect the fear of his name, in the hearts of his own people--""My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am,"" said David, ""afraid of thy judgments"" (Psa 119:120).","When God smote Uzzah, David was afraid of God that day (1 Chron 13:12).","Indeed, many regard not the works of the Lord, nor take notice of the operation of his hands, and such cannot fear the Lord.","But others observe and regard, and wisely consider of his doings, and of the judgments that he executeth, and that makes them fear the Lord.",This God himself suggesteth as a means to make us fear him.,"Hence he commands the false prophet to be stoned, ""that all Israel might hear and fear.""","Hence also he commanded that the rebellious son should be stoned, ""that all Israel might hear and fear.""","A false witness was also to have the same judgment of God executed upon him, ""that all Israel might hear and fear.""","The man also that did ought presumptuously was to die, ""that all Israel might hear and fear"" (Deut 13:11, 21:21, 17:13, 19:20).","There is a natural tendency in judgments, as judgments, to beget a fear of God in the heart of man, as man; but when the observation of the judgment of God is made by him that hath a principle of true grace in his soul, that observation being made, I say, by a gracious heart, produceth a fear of God in the soul of its own nature, to wit, a gracious or godly fear of God.",Eighth.,"This godly fear also flows from a godly remembrance of our former distresses, when we were distressed with our first fears; for though our first fears were begotten in us by the Spirit's working as a spirit of bondage, and so are not always to be entertained as such, yet even that fear leaveth in us, and upon our spirits, that sense and relish of our first awakenings and dread, as also occasioneth and produceth this godly fear.","""Take heed,"" says God, ""and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life, but teach them thy sons, and thy son's sons.""","But what were the things that their eyes had seen, that would so damnify them should they be forgotten?","The answer is, the things which they saw at Horeb; to wit, the fire, the smoke, the darkness, the earthquake, their first awakenings by the law, by which they were brought into a bondage fear; yea, they were to remember this especially--""Specially,"" saith he, ""the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth"" (Deut 4:9-11).","The remembrance of what we saw, felt, feared, and trembled under the sense of, when our first fears were upon us, is that which will produce in our hearts this godly filial fear.",Ninth.,"This godly fear flows from our receiving of an answer of prayer, when we supplicated for mercy at the hand of God.","See the proof for this--""If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities, whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be: what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men).","That they may fear thee all the days of their life, that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers"" (1 Kings 8:37-40).",Tenth.,"This grace of fear also flows from a blessed conviction of the all-seeing eye of God; that is, from a belief that he certainly knoweth the heart, and seeth every one of the turnings and returnings thereof; this is intimated in the text last mentioned--""Whose heart thou knowest, that they may fear thee,"" to wit, so many of them as be, or shall be convinced of this.","Indeed, without this conviction, this godly fear cannot be in us; the want of this conviction made the Pharisees such hypocrites--""Ye are they,"" said Christ, ""which justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts"" (Luke 16:15).","The Pharisees, I say, were not aware of this; therefore they so much preferred themselves before those that by far were better than themselves, and it is for want of this conviction that men go on in such secret sins as they do, so much without fear either of God or his judgments.",[16] Eleventh.,This grace of fear also flows from a sense of the impartial judgment of God upon men according to their works.,This also is manifest from the text mentioned above.,"And give unto every man according to his works or ways, ""that they may fear thee,"" &c. This is also manifest by that of Peter--""And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear"" (1 Peter 1:17).","He that hath godly conviction of this fear of God, will fear before him; by which fear their hearts are poised, and works directed with trembling, according to the will of God.","Thus you see what a weighty and great grace this grace of the holy fear of God is, and how all the graces of the Holy Ghost yield mutually their help and strength to the nourishment and life of it; and also how it flows from them all, and hath a dependence upon every one of them for its due working in the heart of him that hath it.",And thus much to show you from whence it flows.,"And now I shall come to the third thing, to wit, to show you What flows from this godly fear.",THIRD.,"Having showed you what godly fear flows from, I come now, I say, to show you what proceedeth or flows from this godly fear of God, where it is seated in the heart of man.","And, First.",There flows from this godly fear a godly reverence of God.,"""He is great,"" said David, ""and greatly to be feared in the assembly of his saints.""","God, as I have already showed you, is the proper object of godly fear; it is his person and majesty that this fear always causeth the eye of the soul to be upon.","""Behold,"" saith David, ""as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us"" (Psa 123:2).",Nothing aweth the soul that feareth God so much as doth the glorious majesty of God.,"His person is above all things feared by them; ""I fear God,"" said Joseph (Gen 42:18).","That is, more than any other; I stand in awe of him, he is my dread, he is my fear, I do all mine actions as in his presence, as in his sight; I reverence his holy and glorious majesty, doing all things as with fear and trembling before him.","This fear makes them have also a very great reverence of his Word; for that also, I told you, was the rule of their fear.","""Princes,"" said David, ""persecuted me without a cause, but my heart standeth in awe,"" in fear, ""of thy word.""","This grace of fear, therefore, from it flows reverence of the words of God; of all laws, that man feareth the word; and no law that is not agreeing therewith (Psa 119:116).",There flows from this godly fear tenderness of God's glory.,"This fear, I say, will cause a man to afflict his soul, when he seeth that by professors dishonour is brought to the name of God and to his Word.","Who would not fear thee, said Jeremiah, O king of nations, for to thee doth it appertain?","He speaks it as being affected with that dishonour, that by the body of the Jews was continually brought to his name, his Word, and ways; he also speaks it of a hearty wish that they once would be otherwise minded.","The same saying in effect hath also John in the Revelation--""Who shall not fear thee, O Lord,"" said he, ""and glorify thy name?""","(Rev 15:4); clearly concluding that godly fear produceth a godly tenderness of God's glory in the world, for that appertaineth unto him; that is, it is due unto him, it is a debt which we owe unto him.","""Give unto the Lord,"" said David, ""the glory due unto his name.""","Now if there be begotten in the heart of the godly, by this grace of fear, a godly tenderness of the glory of God, then it follows of consequence, that where they that have this fear of God do see his glory diminished by the wickedness of the children of men, there they are grieved and deeply distressed.","""Rivers of waters,"" said David, ""run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law"" (Psa 119:136).","Let met give you for this these following instances-- How was David provoked when Goliath defied the God of Israel (1 Sam 17:23-29,45,46).","Also, when others reproached God, he tells us that that reproach was even as ""a sword in his bones"" (Psa 42:10).",How was Hezekiah afflicted when Rabshakeh railed upon his God (Isa 37).,"David also, for the love that he had to the glory of God's word, ran the hazard and reproach ""of all the mighty people"" (Psa 119:151, 89:50).","How tender of the glory of God was Eli, Daniel, and the three children in their day.","Eli died with fear and trembling of heart when he heard that ""the ark of God was taken"" (1 Sam 4:14-18).","Daniel ran the danger of the lions' mouths, for the tender love that he had to the word and worship of God (Dan 6:10-16).","The three children ran the hazard of a burning fiery furnace, rather than they would dare to dishonour the way of their God (Dan 3:13,16,20).","This therefore is one of the fruits of this godly fear, to wit, a reverence of his name and tenderness of his glory.",Second.,"There flows from this godly fear, watchfulness.","As it is said of Solomon's servants, they ""watched about his bed, because of fear in the night,"" so it may be said of them that have this godly fear--it makes them a watchful people.","It makes them watch their hearts, and take heed to keep them with all diligence, lest they should, by one or another of its flights, lead them to do that which in itself is wicked (Prov 4:23; Heb 12:15).","It makes them watch, lest some temptation from hell should enter into their heart to the destroying of them (1 Peter 5:8).","It makes them watch their mouths, and keep them also, at sometimes, as with a bit and bridle, that they offend not with their tongue, knowing that the tongue is apt, being an evil member, soon to catch the fire of hell, to the defiling of the whole body (James 3:2-7).","It makes them watch over their ways, look well to their goings, and to make straight steps for their feet (Psa 39:1; Heb 12:13).","Thus this godly fear puts the soul upon its watch, lest from the heart within, or from the devil without, or from the world, or some other temptation, something should surprise and overtake the child of God to defile him, or to cause him to defile the ways of God, and so offend the saints, open the mouths of men, and cause the enemy to speak reproachfully of religion.",Third.,"There flows from this fear a holy provocation to a reverential converse with saints in their religious and godly assemblies, for their further progress in the faith and way of holiness.","""Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another.""","Spake, that is, of God, and his holy and glorious name, kingdom, and works, for their mutual edification; ""a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name"" (Mal 3:16).","The fear of the Lord in the heart provoketh to this in all its acts, not only of necessity, but of nature: it is the natural effect of this godly fear, to exercise the church in the contemplation of God, together and apart.","All fear, good and bad, hath a natural propenseness in it to incline the heart to contemplate upon the object of fear, and though a man should labour to take off his thoughts from the object of his fear, whether that object was men, hell, devils, &c., yet do what he could the next time his fear had any act in it, it would return again to its object.","And so it is with godly fear; that will make a man speak of, and think upon, the name of God reverentially (Psa 89:7); yea, and exercise himself in the holy thoughts of him in such sort that his soul shall be sanctified, and seasoned with such meditations.","Indeed, holy thoughts of God, such as you see this fear doth exercise the heart withal, prepare the heart to, and for God.","This fear therefore it is that David prayed for, for the people, when he said, ""O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee"" (1 Chron 29:18).",Fourth.,"There flows from this fear of God great reverence of his majesty, in and under the use and enjoyment of God's holy ordinances.","His ordinances are his courts and palaces, his walks and places, where he giveth his presence to those that wait upon him in them, in the fear of his name.","And this is the meaning of that of the apostle: ""Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, and were edified; and, walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied"" (Acts 9:31).","""And walking""--that word intendeth their use of the ordinances of God.",They walked in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.,"This, in Old Testament language, is called, treading God's courts, and walking in his paths.","This, saith the text, they did here, in the fear of God.","That is, in a great reverence of that God whose ordinances they were.","""Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary; I am the Lord"" (Lev 19:30, 26:2).","It is one thing to be conversant in God's ordinances, and another to be conversant in them with a due reverence of the majesty and name of that God whose ordinances they are: it is common for men to do the first, but none can do the last without this fear.","""In thy fear,"" said David, ""will I worship"" (Psa 5:7).","It is this fear of God, therefore, from whence doth flow that great reverence that his saints have in them, of his majesty, in and under the use and enjoyment of God's holy ordinances; and, consequently, that makes our service in the performance of them acceptable to God through Christ (Heb 12).","For God expects that we serve him with fear and trembling, and it is odious among men, for a man in the presence, or about the service of his prince, to behave himself lightly, and without due reverence of that majesty in whose presence and about whose business he is.","And if so, how can their service to God have anything like acceptation from the hand of God, that is done, not in, but without the fear of God?","This service must needs be an abomination to him, and these servers must come off with rebuke.",Fifth.,"There flows from this godly fear of God, self-denial.","That is, a holy abstaining from those things that are either unlawful or inexpedient; according to that of Nehemiah, ""The former governors that had been before me, were chargeable unto the people, that had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver, yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God"" (Neh 5:15).","[17] Here not was self-denial; he would not do as they did that went before him, neither himself, nor should his servants; but what was it that put him upon these acts of self-denial?","The answer is, the fear of God: ""but so did not I, because of the fear of God.""","Now, whether by the fear of God in this place be meant his Word, or the grace of fear in his heart, may perhaps be a scruple to some, but in my judgment the text must have respect to the latter, to wit, to the grace of fear, for without that being indeed in the heart, the word will not produce that good self-denial in us, that here you find this good man to live in the daily exercise of.","The fear of God, therefore, that was the cause of his self-denial, was this grace of fear in his heart.","This made him to be, as was said before, tender of the honour of God, and of the salvation of his brother: yea, so tender, that rather than he would give an occasion to the weak to stumble, or be offended, he would even deny himself of that which others never sticked to do.","Paul also, through the sanctifying operations of this fear of God in his heart, did deny himself even of lawful things, for the profit and commodity of his brother--""I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend""; that is, if his eating of it would make his brother to offend (1 Cor 8:13).","Men that have not this fear of God in them, will not, cannot deny themselves--of love to God, and the good of the weak, who are subject to stumble at indifferent things--but where this grace of fear is, there follows self-denial; there men are tender of offending; and count that it far better becomes their profession to be of a self-denying, condescending conversation and temper, than to stand sturdily to their own liberty in things inexpedient, whoever is offended thereat.","This grace of fear, therefore, is a very excellent thing, because it yieldeth such excellent fruit as this.","For this self-denial, of how little esteem soever it be with some, yet the want of it, if the words of Christ be true, as they are, takes quite away from even a professor the very name of a disciple (Matt 10:37,38; Luke 14:26,27,33).","They, says Nehemiah, lorded it over the brethren, but so did not I.","They took bread and wine, and forty shekels of silver of them, but so did not I; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people, ""but so did not I, because of the fear of God.""",Sixth.,"There flows from this godly fear of God ""singleness of heart"" (Col 3:22).","Singleness of heart both to God and man; singleness of heart, that is it which in another place is called sincerity and godly simplicity, and it is this, when a man doth a thing simply for the sake of him or of the law that commands it, without respect to this by-end,[18] or that desire of praise or of vain-glory from others; I say, when our obedience to God is done by us simply or alone for God's sake, for his Word's sake, without any regard to this or that by-end or reserve, ""not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.""","A man is more subject to nothing than to swerve from singleness of heart in his service to God, and obedience to his will.","How doth the Lord charge the children of Israel, and all their obedience, and that for seventy years together, with the want of singleness of heart towards him--""When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?","And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?""","(Zech 7:5,6).","They wanted this singleness of heart in their fasting, and in their eating, in their mourning, and in their drinking; they had double hearts in what they did.","They did not as the apostle bids; ""whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.""","And the reason of their want of this thing was, they wanted this fear of God; for that, as the apostle here saith, effecteth singleness of heart to God, and makes a man, as John said of Gaius, ""do faithfully whatsoever he doth"" (3 John 5).","And the reason is, as hath been already urged, for that grace of fear of God retaineth and keepeth upon the heart a reverent and awful sense of the dread majesty and all-seeing eye of God, also a due consideration of the day of account before him; it likewise maketh his service sweet and pleasing, and fortifies the soul against all discouragements; by this means, I say, the soul, in its service to God or man, is not so soon captivated as where there is not this fear, but through and by it its service is accepted, being single, sincere, simple, and faithful; when others, with what they do, are cast into hell for their hypocrisy, for they mix not what they do with godly fear.","Singleness of heart in the service of God is of such absolute necessity, that without it, as I have hinted, nothing can be accepted; because where that is wanting, there wanteth love to God, and to that which is true holiness indeed.",It was this singleness of heart that made Nathanael so honourable in the eyes of Jesus Christ.,"""Behold,"" said he, ""an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile"" (John 1:47).",And it was the want of it that made him so much abhor the Pharisees.,"They wanted sincerity, simplicity, and godly sincerity in their souls, and so became an abhorrence in his esteem.","Now, I say, this golden grace, singleness of heart, it flows from this godly fear of God.",Seventh.,"There flows from this godly fear of God, compassion and bowels to those of the saints that are in necessity and distress.","This is manifest in good Obadiah; it is said of him, ""That he took an hundred"" of the Lord's ""prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water,"" in the days when Jezebel, that tyrant, sought their lives to destroy them (1 Kings 18:3,4).","But what was it that moved so upon his heart, as to cause him to do this thing?","Why, it was this blessed grace of the fear of God.","""Now Obadiah,"" saith the text, ""feared the Lord greatly, for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.""","This was charity to the distressed, even to the distressed for the Lord's sake.","Had not Obadiah served the Lord, yea, had he not greatly feared him, he would not have been able to do this thing, especially as the case then stood with him, and also with the church at that time, for then Jezebel sought to slay all that indeed feared the Lord; yea, and the persecution prevailed so much at that time, that even Elijah himself thought that she had killed all but him.","But now, even now, the fear of God in this good man's heart put forth itself into acts of mercy though attended with so imminent danger.","See here, therefore, that the fear of God will put forth itself in the heart where God hath put it, even to show kindness, and to have compassion upon the distressed servants of God, even under Jezebel's nose; for Obadiah dwelt in Ahab's house, and Jezebel was Ahab's wife, and a horrible persecutor, as was said before: yet Obadiah will show mercy to the poor because he feared God, yea, he will venture her displeasure, his place, and neck, and all, but he will be merciful to his brethren in distress.","Cornelius, also, being a man possessed with this fear of God, became a very free-hearted and open-handed man to the poor--""He feared God, and gave much alms to the people.""","Indeed this fear, this godly fear of God, it is a universal grace; it will stir up the soul unto all good duties.","It is a fruitful grace; from it, where it is, floweth abundance of excellent virtues; nor without it can there be anything good, or done well, that is done.","But, Eighth.","There flows from this fear of God hearty, fervent, and constant prayer.","This also is seen in Cornelius, that devout man.",He feared God; and what then?,"why, he gave much alms to the people, ""and prayed to God alway"" (Acts 10:1,2).","Did I say that hearty, fervent, and constant prayer flowed from this fear of God?","I will add, that if the whole duty, and the continuation of it, be not managed with this fear of God, it profiteth nothing at all.","It is said of our Lord Jesus Christ himself, ""He was heard in that he feared.""","He prayed, then, because he feared, because he feared God, and therefore was his prayer accepted of him, even because he feared--""He was heard in that he feared"" (Heb 5:7).","This godly fear is so essential to right prayer, and right prayer is such an inseparable effect and fruit of this fear, that you must have both or none; he that prayeth not feareth not God, yea, he that prayeth not fervently and frequently feareth him not; and so he that feareth him not cannot pray; for if prayer be the effect of this fear of God, then without this fear, prayer, fervent prayer, ceaseth.",How can they pray or make conscience of the duty that fear not God?,"O prayerless man, thou fearest not God!","Thou wouldest not live so like a swine or a dog in the world as thou dost, if thou fearest the Lord.",Ninth.,"There floweth from this fear of God a readiness or willingness, at God's call, to give up our best enjoyments to his disposal.","This is evident in Abraham, who at God's call, without delay, rose early in the morning to offer up his only and well-beloved Isaac a burnt-offering in the place where God should appoint him.","It was a rare thing that Abraham did; and had he not had this rare grace, this fear of God, he would not, he could not have done to God's liking so wonderful a thing.","It is true the Holy Ghost also makes this service of Abraham to be the fruit of his faith--""By faith Abraham offered up Isaac, and he that had received the promises offered up his only-begotten son"" (Heb 11; James 2).","Aye, and without doubt love unto God, in Abraham, was not wanting in this his service, nor was this grace of fear; nay, in the story where it is recorded.","There it is chiefly accounted for the fruit of his godly fear, and that by an angel from heaven--""And the angel called out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham.","And he said, Here am I.","And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him, for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me"" (Gen 22:11,12).","Now I know it; now, now thou hast offered up thine only Isaac, thine all, at the bidding of thy God.",Now I know it.,The fear of God is not presently discerned in the heart and life of a man.,"Abraham had long before this done many a holy duty, and showed much willingness of heart to observe and do the will of God; yet you find not, as I remember, that he had this testimony from heaven that he feared God till now; but now he has it, now he has it from heaven.","""Now I know that thou fearest God.""","Many duties may be done--though I do not say that Abraham did them--without the fear of God; but when a man shall not stick at, or withhold, his darling from God, when called upon by God to offer it up unto him, that declareth, yea, and gives conviction to angels, that now he feareth God.",Tenth.,There floweth from this godly fear humility of mind.,"This is evident, because, when the apostle cautions the Romans against the venom of spiritual pride, he directs them to the exercise of this blessed grace of fear as its antidote.","""Be not high-minded,"" saith he, ""but fear"" (Rom 11:20).","Pride, spiritual pride, which is here set forth by the word ""high-minded,"" is a sin of a very high and damnable nature; it was the sin of the fallen angels, and is that which causeth men to fall into the same condemnation--""Lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the devil.""","Pride, I say, it damns a professor with the damnation of devils, with the damnation of hell, and therefore it is a deadly, deadly sin.","Now against this deadly sin is set the grace of humility; that comely garment, for so the apostle calls it, saying, ""be clothed with humility.""","But the question is now, how we should attain to, and live in, the exercise of this blessed and comely grace?","to which the apostle answers, Fear; be afraid with godly fear, and thence will flow humility--""Be not high-minded, but fear.""","That is, Fear, or be continually afraid and jealous of yourselves, and of your own naughty hearts, also fear lest at some time or other the devil, your adversary, should have advantage of you.","Fear, lest by forgetting what you are by nature, you also forget the need that you have of continual pardon, support, and supplies from the Spirit of grace, and so grow proud of your own abilities, or of what you have received of God, and fall into the condemnation of the devil.","Fear, and that will make you little in your own eyes, keep you humble, put you upon crying to God for protection, and upon lying at his foot for mercy; that will also make you have low thoughts of your own parts, your own doings, and cause you to prefer your brother before yourself, and so you will walk in humiliation, and be continually under the teachings of God, and under his conduct in your way.","The humble, God will teach--""The meek will he guide in judgment, the meek will he teach his way.""","From this grace of fear then flows this excellent and comely thing, humility; yea, it also is maintained by this fear.","Fear takes off a man from trusting to himself, it puts a man upon trying of all things, it puts a man upon desiring counsel and help from heaven, it makes a man ready and willing to hear instruction, and makes a man walk lowly, softly, and so securely in the way.",Eleventh.,"There flows from this grace of fear, hope in the mercy of God--""The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his mercy"" (Psa 147:11).","The latter part of the text is an explanation of the former: as if the psalmist had said, They be the men that fear the Lord, even they that hope in his mercy; for true fear produceth hope in God's mercy.",And it is further manifest thus.,"Fear, true fear of God inclineth the heart to a serious inquiry after that way of salvation which God himself hath prescribed; now the way that God hath appointed, by the which the sinner is to obtain the salvation of his soul, is his mercy as so and so set forth in the Word, and godly fear hath special regard to the Word.","To this way, therefore, the sinner with this godly fear submits his soul, rolls himself upon it, and so is delivered from that death into which others, for want of this fear of God, do headlong fall.","It is, as I also hinted before, the nature of godly fear to be very much putting the soul upon the inquiry which is, and which is not, the thing approved of God, and accordingly to embrace it or shun it.","Now I say, this fear having put the soul upon a strict and serious inquiry after the way of salvation, at last it finds it to be by the mercy of God in Christ; therefore this fear putteth the soul upon hoping also in him for eternal life and blessedness; by which hope he doth not only secure his soul, but becomes a portion of God's delight--""The Lord takes pleasure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his mercy.""","Besides, this godly fear carrieth in it self-evidence that the state of the sinner is happy, because possessed with this happy grace.","Therefore, as John saith, ""We know we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren"" (1 John 3:14).","So here, ""The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his mercy.""","If I fear God, and if my fearing of him is a thing in which he taketh such pleasure, then may I boldly venture to roll myself for eternal life into the bosom of his mercy, which is Christ.","This fear also produceth hope; if therefore, poor sinner, thou knowest thyself to be one that is possessed with this fear of God, suffer thyself to be persuaded therefore to hope in the mercy of God for salvation, for the Lord takes pleasure in thee.",And it delights him to see thee hope in his mercy.,Twelfth.,"There floweth from this godly fear of God an honest and conscientious use of all those means which God hath ordained, that we should be conversant in for our attaining salvation.","Faith and hope in God's mercy is that which secureth our justification and hope, and as you have heard, they do flow from this fear.","But now, besides faith and hope, there is a course of life in those things in which God hath ordained us to have our conversation, without which there is no eternal life.","""Ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life""; and again, ""without holiness no man shall see the Lord.""","Not that faith and hope are deficient, if they be right, but they are both of them counterfeit when not attended with a reverent use of all the means: upon the reverent use of which the soul is put by this grace of fear.","""Wherefore, beloved,"" said Paul, ""as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in mine absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling"" (Rom 6:22; Heb 12:14; Phil 2:11).","There is a faith and hope of mercy that may deceive a man (though the faith of God's elect, and the hope that purifies the heart never will), because they are alone, and not attended with those companions that accompany salvation (Heb 6:3-8).","But now this godly fear carries in its bowels, not only a moving of the soul to faith and hope in God's mercy, but an earnest provocation to the holy and reverent use of all the means that God has ordained for a man to have his conversation in, in order to his eternal salvation.","""Work out your salvation with fear.""","Not that work is meritorious, or such that can purchase eternal life, for eternal life is obtained by hope in God's mercy; but this hope, if it be right, is attended with this godly fear, which fear putteth the soul upon a diligent use of all those means that may tend to the strengthening of hope, and so to the making of us holy in all manner of conversation, that we may be meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.","For hope purifieth the heart, if fear of God shall be its companion, and so maketh a man a vessel of mercy prepared unto glory.","Paul bids Timothy to fly pride, covetousness, doting about questions, and the like, and to ""follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience; to fight the good fight of faith, and to lay hold on eternal life"" (1 Tim 6).","So Peter bids that we ""add to our faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity""; adding, ""for if these things be in you and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.","Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure; for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.","For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ"" (2 Peter 1:5-11).","The sum of all which is that which was mentioned before; to wit, ""to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling.""","For none of these things can be conscientiously done, but by and with the help of this blessed grace of fear.",Thirteenth.,"There flows from this fear, this godly fear, a great delight in the holy commands of God, that is, a delight to be conformable unto them.","""Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his commandments"" (Psa 112:1).","This confirmeth that which was said before, to wit, that this fear provoketh to a holy and reverent use of the means; for that cannot be, when there is not an holy, yea, a great delight in the commandments.","Wherefore this fear maketh the sinner to abhor that which is sin, because that is contrary to the object of his delight.","A man cannot delight himself at the same time in things directly opposite one to another, as sin and the holy commandment is; therefore Christ saith of the servant, he cannot love God and mammon--""Ye cannot serve God and mammon.""","If he cleaves to the one, he must hate and despise the other; there cannot at the same time be service to both, because that themselves are at enmity one with the other.",So is sin and the commandment.,"Therefore if a man delighteth himself in the commandment, he hateth that which is opposite, which is sin: how much more when he greatly delighteth in the commandment?","Now, this holy fear of God it taketh the heart and affections from sin, and setteth them upon the holy commandment.",Therefore such a man is rightly esteemed blessed.,"For no profession makes a man blessed but that which is accompanied with an alienation of the heart from sin, nor doth anything do that when this holy fear is wanting.","It is from this fear then, that love to, and delight in, the holy commandment floweth, and so by that the sinner is kept from those falls and dangers of miscarrying that other professors are so subject to: he greatly delights in the commandment.",Fourteenth.,"Lastly, There floweth from this fear of God, enlargement of heart.","""Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged"" (Isa 60:5).","""Thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged,"" enlarged to God-ward, enlarged to his ways, enlarged to his holy people, enlarged in love after the salvation of others.","Indeed when this fear of God is wanting, though the profession be never so famous, the heart is shut up and straitened, and nothing is done in that princely free spirit which is called ""the spirit of the fear of the Lord"" (Psa 51:12; Isa 11:2).","But with grudging, legally, or with desire of vain-glory, this enlargedness of heart is wanting, for that flows from this fear of the Lord.","Thus have I showed you both what this fear of God is, what it flows from, and also what doth flow from it.",I come now to show you some OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THEM THAT THUS DO FEAR THE LORD.,"Having thus briefly handled in particular thus far this fear of God, I shall now show you certain of the excellent privileges of them that fear the Lord, not that they are not privileges that have been already mentioned; for what greater privileges than to have this fear producing in the soul such excellent things so necessary for us for good, both with reference to this world, and that which is to come?","But because those fourteen above named do rather flow from this grace of fear where it is, than from a promise to the person that hath it, therefore I have chosen rather to discourse of them as the fruits and effects of fear, than otherwise.","Now, besides all these, there is entailed by promise to the man that hath this fear many other blessed privileges, the which I shall now in a brief way lay open unto you.","First Privilege, then.","That man that feareth the Lord, has a grant and a license ""to trust in the Lord,"" with an affirmation that he is their help, and their shield--""Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord; he is their help and their shield"" (Psa 115:11).",Now what a privilege is this!,"an exhortation in general to sinners, as sinners, to trust in him, is a privilege great and glorious; but for a man to be singled out from his neighbours, for a man to be spoken to from heaven, as it were by name, and to be told that God hath given him a license, a special and peculiar grant to trust in him, this is abundantly more;

should there want both the Word and them that preach it in the place that thou dost dwell, yet bread shall be given thee, and thy water shall be sure; thou shalt not die of the famine, because thou fearest God.","I say, that man shall not, behold he shall not, because he feareth God, and this the next head doth yet more fully manifest.",Fifth Privilege.,Dost thou fear God?,"fear him for this advantage more and more--""O fear the Lord, ye his saints, for there is no want to them that fear him.","The young lions do lack and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord,"" that fear him, ""shall not want any good thing"" (Psa 34:9,10).",Not anything that God sees good for them shall those men want that fear the Lord.,"If health will do them good, if sickness will do them good, if riches will do them good, if poverty will do them good, if life will do them good, if death will do them good, then they shall not want them, neither shall any of these come nigh them, if they will not do them good.","The lions, the wicked people [19] of the world that fear not God, are not made sharers in this great privilege;

for, indeed, all these kinds of fear have torment, and therefore may be cast out; and are so by the spirit of adoption, which is called the spirit of faith and love, when he comes with power into the soul; so that without this fear we should serve him.","But to argue from these texts that we ought not to fear God, or to mix fear with our worship of him, is as much as to say that by the spirit of adoption we are made very rogues;

the spirit of the fear of the Lord is a grace that greatly beautifies a Christian, his words, and all his ways: ""Wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed, and do it, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts"" (2 Chron 19:7).",I come now to make some use and application of this doctrine.,THE USE OF THIS DOCTRINE.,"Having proceeded thus far about this doctrine of the fear of God, I now come to make some use and application of the whole;

for naturally none fear God, there is no fear of God, none of this grace of fear before their eyes, they do not so much as know what it is; for this fear flows, as was showed before, from a new heart, faith, repentance and the like; of which new heart, faith, and repentance, if thou be void, thou art also void of this godly fear.","Men must have a mighty change of heart and life, or else they are strangers to this fear of God.","Alas, how ignorant are the most of this!","Yea, and some are not afraid to say they are not changed, nor desire so to be.",Can these fear God?,can these be possessed with this grace of fear?,"No: ""Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God"" (Psa 55:19; Psa 36:1; Rom 3:18).","Wherefore, sinner, consider whoever thou art that art destitute of this fear of God, thou art void of all other graces; for this fear, as also I have showed, floweth from the whole stock of grace where it is.","There is not one of the graces of the Spirit, but this fear is in the bowels of it; yea, as I may say, this fear is the flower and beauty of every grace; neither is there anything, let it look as much like grace as it will, that will be counted so indeed, if the fruit thereof be not this fear of God; wherefore, I say again, consider well of this matter, for as thou shalt be found with reference to this grace, so shall thy judgment be.","I have but briefly treated of this grace, yet have endeavoured, with words as fit as I could, to display it in its colours before thy face, first by showing you what this fear of God is, then what it flows from, as also what doth flow from it; to which, as was said before, I have added several privileges that are annexed to this fear, that by all, if it may be, thou mayest see it if thou hast it, and thyself without it if thou hast it not.","Wherefore I refer thee thither again for information in this thing; or if thou art loath to give the book a second reading, but wilt go on to the end now thou art gotten hither; then Second and particularly, I conclude with these several propositions concerning those that fear not God.",1.,"That man that is proud, and of a high and lofty mind, fears not God.","This is plain from the exhortation, ""Be not high-minded, but fear"" (Rom 11:20).","Here you see that a high mind and the fear of God are set in direct opposition the one to the other; and there is in them, closely concluded by the apostle, that where indeed the one is, there cannot be the other; where there is a high mind, there is not the fear of God; and where there is the fear of God, the mind is not high but lowly.","Can a man at the same time be a proud man, and fear God too?","Why, then, is it said God beholdeth every one that is proud, and abases him?","and again, He beholds the proud afar off?","He therefore that is proud of his person, of his riches, of his office, of his parts, and the like, feareth not God.","It is also manifest further, for God resisteth the proud, which he would not do, if he feared him, but in that he sets him at such a distance from him, in that he testifies that he will abase him and resist him, it is evident that he is not the man that hath this grace of fear; for that man, as I have showed you, is the man of God's delight, the object of his pleasure (Psa 138:6; James 4:6; 1 Peter 5:5; Mal 4:1).",2.,The covetous man feareth not God.,"This also is plain from the Word, because it setteth covetousness and the fear of God in direct opposition.",Men that fear God are said to hate covetousness (Exo 18:21).,"Besides, the covetous man is called an idolater, and is said to have no part in the kingdom of Christ and of God.","And again, ""The wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth"" (Eze 33:31; Eph 5:5; Psa 10:3).","Hearken to this, you that hunt the world to take it, you that care not how you get, so you get the world.","Also you that make even religion your stalking-horse to get the world, you fear not God.",And what will you do whose hearts go after your covetousness?,"you who are led by covetousness up and down, as it were by the nose; sometimes to swear, to lie, to cozen, and cheat and defraud, when you can get the advantage to do it.","You are far, very far, from the fear of God.","""Ye adulterers and adulteresses,"" for so the covetous are called, ""know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?","whosoever, therefore, will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God"" (James 4:4).",3.,The riotous eaters of flesh have not the fear of God.,"For this is done ""without fear"" (Jude 12).","Gluttony is a sin little taken notice of, and as little repented of by those that use it, but yet it is odious in the sight of God, and the practice of it a demonstration of the want of his fear in the heart: yea, so odious is it, that God forbids that his people should so much as company with such.","""Be not,"" saith he, ""among wine-bibbers, among riotous eaters of flesh"" (Prov 23:20).","And he further tells us, that they that are such, are spots and blemishes to those that keep them company, for indeed they fear not God (2 Peter 2:13; Rom 13:13; 1 Peter 4:4).",Alas!,"some men are as if they were for nought else born but to eat and to drink, and pamper their carcasses with the dainties of this world, quite forgetting why God sent them hither; but such, as is said, fear not God, and so consequently are of the number of them upon whom the day of judgment will come at unawares (Luke 21:34).",4.,The liar is one that fears not God.,"This also is evident from the plain text, ""Thou hast lied,"" saith the Lord, ""and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart: have not I held my peace even of old,"" saith the Lord, ""and thou fearest me not?""",(Isa 57:11).,"What lie this was is not material; it was a lie, or a course of lying that is here rebuked, and the person or persons in this practice, as is said, were such as feared not God; a course of lying and the fear of God cannot stand together.","This sin of lying is a common sin, and it walketh in the world in several guises.","There is the profane scoffing liar, there is the cunning artificial liar, there is the hypocritical religious liar, with liars of other ranks and degrees.","But none of them all have the fear of God, nor shall any of them, they not repenting, escape the damnation of hell--""All liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone"" (Rev 21:8).","Heaven and the New Jerusalem are not a place for such--""And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie"" (v 27).","Therefore another scripture says that all liars are without--""For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie"" (Rev 22:15).","But this should not be their sentence, judgment, and condemnation, if they that are liars were such as had in them this blessed fear of God.",5.,"They fear not God who cry unto him for help in the time of their calamity, and when they are delivered, they return to their former rebellion.","This, Moses, in a spirit of prophecy, asserteth at the time of the mighty judgment of the hail.",Pharaoh then desired him to pray to God that he would take away that judgment from him.,"Well, so I will, said Moses, ""But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God"" (Exo 9:30).","As who should say, I know that so soon as this judgment is removed, you will to your old rebellion again.","And what greater demonstration can be given that such a man feareth not God, than to cry to God to be delivered from affliction to prosperity, and to spend that prosperity in rebellion against him?","This is crying for mercies that they may be spent, or that we may have something to spend upon our lusts, and in the service of Satan (John 4:1-3).","Of these God complains in the sixteenth of Ezekiel, and in the second of Hosea--""Thou hast,"" saith God, ""taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images"" &c. (Eze 16:17).",This was for want of the fear of God.,"Many of this kind there be now in the world, both of men, and women, and children; art not thou that readest this book of this number?","Hast thou not cried for health when sick, for wealth when poor, when lame for strength, when in prison for liberty, and then spent all that thou gottest by thy prayer in the service of Satan, and to gratify thy lusts?","Look to it, sinner, these things are signs that with thy heart thou fearest not God.",6.,"They fear not God that way-lay his people and seek to overthrow them, or to turn them besides the right path, as they are journeying from hence to their eternal rest.","This is evident from the plain text, ""Remember,"" saith God, ""what Amalek did unto thee by the way when ye were come forth out of Egypt; how he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary, and he feared not God"" (Deut 25:17,18).","Many such Amalekites there be now in the world that set themselves against the feeble of the flock, against the feeble of the flock especially, still smiting them, some by power, some with the tongue, some in their lives and estates, some in their names and reputations, by scandals, slanders, and reproach, but the reason of this their ungodly practice is this, they fear not God.","For did they fear him, they would be afraid to so much as think, much more of attempting to afflict and destroy, and calumniate the children of God; but such there have been, such there are, and such there will be in the world, for all men fear not God.",7.,"They fear not God who see his hand upon backsliders for their sins, and yet themselves will be backsliders also.","""I saw,"" saith God, ""when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery, I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce, yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also"" (Jer 3:8, 2:19).","Judah saw that her sister was put away, and delivered by God into the hands of Shalmaneser, who carried her away beyond Babylon, and yet, though she saw it, she went and played the harlot also--a sign of great hardness of heart, and of the want of the fear of God indeed.","For this fear, had it been in her heart, it would have taught her to have trembled at the judgment that was executed upon her sister, and not to have gone and played the harlot also: and not to have done it while her sister's judgment was in sight and memory.",But what is it that a heart that is destitute of the fear of God will not do?,"No sin comes amiss to such: yea, they will sin, they will do that themselves, for the doing of which they believe some are in hell-fire, and all because they fear not God.","But pray observe, if those that take not warning when they see the hand of God upon backsliders, are said to have none of the fear of God, have they it, think you, that lay stumbling-blocks in the way of God's people, and use devices to cause them to backslide, yea, rejoice when they can do this mischief to any?","and yet many of this sort there are in the world, that even rejoice when they see a professor fall into sin, and go back from his profession, as if they had found some excellent thing.",8.,"They fear not God who can look upon a land as wallowing in sin, and yet are not humbled at the sight thereof.","""Have ye,"" said God by the prophet to the Jews, ""forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?","They are not humbled to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law"" (Jer 44:9,10).","Here is a land full of wickedness, and none to bewail it, for they wanted the fear of God, and love to walk in his law.","But how say you, if they that are not humbled at their own and others' wickedness are said not to fear, or have the fear of God, what shall we think or say of such that receive, that nourish and rejoice in such wickedness?",Do they fear God?,"Yea, what shall we say of such that are the inventors and promoters of wickedness, as of oaths, beastly talk, or the like?","Do they, do you think, fear God?","Once again, what shall we say of such that cannot be content to be wicked themselves, and to invent and rejoice in other men's wickedness, but must hate, reproach, vilify and abuse those that they cannot persuade to be wicked?",Do they fear God?,9.,"They that take more heed to their own dreams than to the Word of God, fear not God.","This also is plain from the Word--""For in the multitude of dreams, there are also divers vanities, but fear thou God""; that is, take heed unto his Word (Eccl 5:7; Isa 8:20).","Here the fearing of God is opposed to our overmuch heeding dreams: and there is implied, that it is for want of the fear of God that men so much heed those things.","What will they say to this that give more heed to a suggestion that ariseth from their foolish hearts, or that is cast in thither by the devil, than they do to the holy Word of God?","These are ""filthy dreamers.""","Also, what shall we say to those that are more confident of the mercy of God to their soul, because he hath blessed them with outward things, than they are afraid of his wrath and condemnation, though the whole of the Word of God doth fully verify the same?","These are ""filthy dreamers"" indeed.","A dream is either real, or so by way of semblance, and so some men dream sleeping, and some waking (Isa 29:7).","And as those that a man dreams sleeping are caused either by God, Satan, business, flesh, or the like; so are they that a man dreams waking, to pass by those that we have in our sleep.","Men, when bodily awake, may have dreams, that is, visions from heaven; such are all they that have a tendency to discover to the sinner his state, or the state of the church according to the Word.","But those that are from Satan, business, and the flesh, are such--especially the first and last, to wit, from Satan and the flesh--as tend to embolden men to hope for good in a way disagreeing with the Word of God.","[25] These Jude calls ""filthy dreamers,"" such whose principles were their dreams, and they led them ""to defile the flesh,"" that is, by fornication and uncleanness; ""to despise dominion,"" that the reins might be laid upon the neck of their lusts; ""to speak evil of dignities,"" of those that God had set over them, for their governing in all the law and testament of Christ, these dreamt that to live like brutes, to be greedy of gain, and to take away for it, as Cain and Balaam did by their wiles, the lives of the owners thereof, would go for good coin in the best of trials.",These also Peter speaks of (2 Peter 2).,"And he makes their dreams, that Jude calls so, their principle and errors in life and doctrine; you may read of them in that whole chapter, where they are called cursed children, and so by consequence such as fear not God.",10.,"They fear not God, who are sorcerers, adulterers, false swearers, and that oppress the hireling of his wages.","It is a custom with some men to keep back by fraud from the hireling that which by covenant they agreed to pay for their labour; pinching, I say, and paring from them their due that of right belongs to them, to the making of them cry in ""the ears of the Lord of sabaoth"" (James 5:4).","These fear not God; they are reckoned among the worst of men, and in their day of account God himself will bear witness against them.","""And I,"" saith God, ""will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord"" (Mal 3:5).",11.,"They fear not God, who instead of pitying of, rail at God's people in their affliction, temptations, and persecutions, and rather rejoice and skip for joy, than sympathize with them in their sorrow.","Thus did David's enemies, thus did Israel's enemies, and thus did the thief, he railed at Christ when he hanged upon the cross, and was for that, even by his fellow, accounted for one that feared not God (Luke 23:40; Psa 35:1,22-26.",Read Oba 10-15; Jer 48:2-6).,"This is a common thing among the children of men, even to rejoice at the hurt of them that fear God, and it ariseth even of an inward hatred to godliness.","They hate you, saith Christ, because they hated me.","Therefore Christ takes what is done to his, in this, as done unto himself, and so to holiness of life.","But this falls hard upon such as despise at, and rejoice to see, God's people in their griefs, and that take the advantage, as dogged Shimei did, to augment the griefs and afflictions of God's people (2 Sam 16:5-8).","These fear not God, they do this of enmity, and their sin is such as will hardly be blotted out (1 Kings 2:8,9).",12.,"They fear not God, who are strangers to the effects of fear.","""If I be a master, where is my fear?""","That is, show that I am so by your fear of me in the effects of your fear of me.","""You offer polluted bread upon mine altar.""","This is not a sign that you fear me, ye offer the blind for sacrifices, where is my fear?","ye offer the lame and the sick, these are not the effects of the fear of God (Mal 1:6-8).","Sinner, it is one thing to say, I fear God, and another to fear him indeed.","Therefore, as James says, show me thy faith by thy works, so here God calls for a testimony of thy fear by the effects of fear.","I have already showed you several effects of fear; if thou art a stranger to them, thou art a stranger to this grace of fear.","Therefore, to conclude this, it is not a feigned profession that will do; nothing is good here, but what is salted with this fear of God, and they that fear him are men of truth, men of singleness of heart, perfect, upright, humble, holy men;

it flows not from love to God: this fear brings not willing subjection, which indeed brings the effect of right fear; but being over-mastered like an hypocrite, thou subjected thyself by feigned obedience, being forced, I say, by mere dread to do it (Psa 66:3).","It is said of David, ""that the fame of him went out into all lands, and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations"" (1 Chron 14:17).","But what, did they now love David?",did they now choose him to be their king?,"no verily; they, many of them, rather hated him, and, when they could, made resistance against him.","They did even as thou dost--feared, but did not love; feared, but did not choose his government that ruled over them.","It is also said of Jehoshaphat, when God had subdued before him Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that ""the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of these countries, when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel"" (2 Chron 20:29).","But, I say, was this fear, that is called now the fear of God, anything else, but a dread of the greatness of power of the king?","No verily, nor did that dread bring them into a willing subjection to, and liking of his laws and government; it only made them like slaves and underlings, stand in fear of his executing the vengeance of God upon them.","Therefore still, notwithstanding this fear, they were rebels to him in their hearts, and when occasion and advantage offered themselves, they showed it by rising in rebellion against Israel.","This fear therefore provoked but feigned and forced obedience, a right emblem of the obedience of such, who being still enemies in their minds to God, are forced by virtue of present conviction to yield a little, even of fear to God, to his Word, and to his ordinances.","Reader, whoever thou art, think of this, it is thy concern, therefore do it, and examine, and examine again, and look diligently to thy heart in thine examination, that it beguile thee not about this thy so great concern, as indeed the fear of God is.","One thing more, before I leave thee, let me warn thee of.",Take heed of deferring to fear the Lord.,"Some men, when they have had conviction upon their heart that the fear of God is not in them, have through the overpowering of their corruptions yet deferred and put off the fear of God from them, as it is said of them in Jeremiah: ""This people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.","Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the Lord"" (Jer 5:23,24).","They saw that the judgments of God attended them because they did not yet fear God, but that conviction would not prevail with them to say, ""Let us now fear the Lord.""",They were for deferring to fear him still;

they have scarce a fellow.","So it was with Job, ""There is none like him in the earth, one that feareth God,"" &c. (Job 1:8).","There was even none in Job's day that feared God like him, no, there was not one like him in all the earth, but doubtless there were more in the world that feared God; but this fearing of him greatly, that is the thing that saints should do, and that was the thing that Job did do, and in that he did outstrip his fellows.","It is also said of Hananiah, that ""he was a faithful man, and feared God above many"" (Neh 7:2).","He also had got, as to the exercise of, and growth in, this grace, the start of many of his brethren.","He ""feared God above many.""","Now then, seeing this grace admits of degrees, and is in some stronger, and in some weaker, let us be all awakened as to other graces, so to this grace also.","That like as you abound in everything, in faith, in utterance, in knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.",I will labour to enforce this exhortation upon you by several motives.,First.,Let God's distinguishing love to you be a motive to you to fear him greatly.,"He hath put his fear in thy heart, and hath not given that blessing to thy neighbour; perhaps not to thy husband, thy wife, thy child, or thy parent.",O what an obligation should this consideration lay upon thy heart greatly to fear the Lord!,"Remember also, as I have showed in the first part of this book, that this fear of the Lord is his treasure, a choice jewel, given only to favourites, and to those that are greatly beloved.","Great gifts naturally tend to oblige, and will do so, I trust, with thee, when thou shalt ingeniously consider it.",It is a sign of a very bad nature when the contrary shows itself; could God have done more for thee than to have put his fear in thy heart?,This is better than to have given thee a place even in heaven without it.,"Yea, had he given thee all faith, all knowledge, and the tongue of men and angels, and a place in heaven to boot, they had all been short of this gift, of the fear of God in thy heart.","Therefore love it, nourish it, exercise it, use all means to cause it to increase and grow in thy heart, that it may appear it is set by at thy hand, poor sinner.",Second.,Another motive to stir thee up to grow in this grace of the fear of God may be the privileges that it lays thee under.,"What or where wilt thou find in the Bible, so many privileges so affectionately entailed to any grace, as to this of the fear of God?","God speaks of this grace, and of the privileges that belong unto it, as if, to speak with reverence, he knew not how to have done blessing of the man that hath it.","It seems to me as if this grace of fear is the darling grace, the grace that God sets his heart upon at the highest rate.","As it were, he embraces the hugs, and lays the man in his bosom, that hath, and grows strong in this grace of the fear of God.","See again the many privileges in which the man is interested that hath this grace in his heart: and see also that there are but few of them, wherever mentioned, but have entailed to them the pronunciation of a blessing, or else that man is spoken of by way of admiration.",Third.,Another motive may be this: The man that groweth in this grace of the fear of the Lord will escape those evils that others will fall into.,"Where this grace is, it keepeth the soul from final apostasy, ""I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me"" (Jer 32:40).","But yet, if there be not an increase in this grace, much evil may attend, and be committed notwithstanding.","There is a child that is healthy, and hath its limbs, and can go, but it is careless; now the evil of carelessness doth disadvantage it very much; carelessness is the cause of stumblings, of falls, of knocks, and that it falls into the dirt, yea, that sometimes it is burned, or almost drowned.","And thus it is, even with God's people that fear him, because they add not to their fear a care of growing more in the fear of God, therefore they reap damage; whereas, were they more in his fear, it would keep them better, deliver them more, and preserve them from these snares of death.",Fourth.,"Another motive may be this: To grow in this grace of the fear of God, is the way to be kept always in a conscientious performance of Christian duties.","An increase in this grace, I say, keeps every grace in exercise, and the keeping of our graces in their due exercise, produceth a conscientious performance of duties.","Thou hast a watch perhaps in thy pocket, but the hand will not as yet be kept in any good order, but does always give the lie as to the hour of the day; well, but what is the way to remedy this, but to look well to the spring, and the wheels within?","for if they indeed go right, so will the hand do also.","This is thy case in spiritual things; thou art a gracious man, and the fear of God is in thee, but yet for all that, one cannot well tell, by thy life, what time of day it is.","[28] Thou givest no true and constant sign that thou art indeed a Christian; why, the reason is, thou dost not look well to this grace of the fear of God.","Thou dost not grow and increase in that, but sufferest thy heart to grow careless, and hard, and so thy life remiss and worldly: Job's growing great in the fear of God made him eschew evil (Job 1, 2:3).",Fifth.,Another motive is: This is the way to be wise indeed.,A wise man feareth and departeth from evil.,"It doth not say a wise man hath the grace of fear, but a wise man feareth, that is, putteth this grace into exercise.",There is no greater sign of wisdom than to grow in this blessed grace.,"Is it not a sign of wisdom to depart from sins, which are the snares of death and hell?",Is it not a sign of wisdom for a man yet more and more to endeavour to interest himself in the love and protection of God?,Is it not a high point of wisdom for a man to be always doing of that which lays him under the conduct of angels?,Surely this is wisdom.,"And if it be a blessing to have this fear, is it not wisdom to increase in it?","Doubtless it is the highest point of wisdom, as I have showed before, therefore grow therein.",Sixth.,"Another motive may be this: It is seemly for saints to fear, and increase in this fear of God.",He is thy Creator; is it not seemly for creatures to fear and reverence their Creator?,He is thy King; is it not seemly for subjects to fear and reverence their King?,He is thy Father; is it not seemly for children to reverence and fear their Father?,"yea, and to do it more and more?",Seventh.,"Another motive may be: It is honourable to grow in this grace of fear; ""When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel"" (Hosea 13:1).","Truly, to fear, and to about in this fear, is a sign of a very princely spirit; and the reason is, when I greatly fear my God, I am above the fear of all others, nor can anything in this world, be it never so terrible and dreadful, move me at all to fear them.","And hence it is that Christ counsels us to fear--""And I say unto you, my friends,"" saith he, ""be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.""","Aye, but this is a high pitch, how should we come by such princely spirits?","well, I will forewarn you whom you shall fear, and by fearing of him, arrive to this pitch, ""Fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, fear him"" (Luke 12:4,5).",Indeed this true fear of God sets a man above all the world.,"And therefore it saith again, ""Neither fear ye their fear,""--but ""sanctify the Lord God"" in your hearts, ""and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread"" (Isa 8:12,13).","Your great ranting, swaggering, roysters,[29] that are ignorant of the nature of the fear of God, count it a poor, sneaking, pitiful, cowardly spirit in men to fear and tremble before the Lord; but whoso looks back to jails and gibbets, to the sword and burning stake, shall see, that there, in them, has been the most mighty and invincible spirit that has been in the world!","Yea, see if God doth not count that the growth of his people in this grace of fear is that which makes them honourable, when he positively excludeth those from a dwelling-place in his house, that do not honour them that fear him (Psa 15:4).","And he saith moreover, ""A woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.""","If the world and godless men will not honour these, they shall be honoured some way else.","Such, saith he, ""that honour me I will honour,"" and they shall be honoured in heaven, in the churches, and among the angels.",Eighth.,"Another motive to grow in this fear of God may be: This fear, and the increase of it, qualifies a man to be put in trust with heavenly and spiritual things, yea, and with earthly things too.",1.,For heavenly and spiritual things.,"""My covenant,"" saith God, ""was with [Levi] of life and peace, and I gave them to him, for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name"" (Mal 2:5).","Behold what a gift, what a mercy, what a blessing this Levi is intrusted with; to wit, with God's everlasting covenant, and with the life and peace that is wrapped up in this covenant.",But why is it given to him?,"the answer is, ""for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.""","And the reason is good, for this fear of God teaches a man to put a due estimation upon every gift of God bestowed upon us; also it teaches us to make use of the same with reverence of his name, and respect to his glory in most godly-wise, all which becomes him that is intrusted with any spiritual gift.","The gift here was given to Levi to minister to his brethren doctrinally thereof, for he, saith God, shall teach Jacob my statutes and Israel my law.","See also Exodus 18:21 and Nehemiah 7:2, with many other places that might be named, and you will find that men fearing God and hating covetousness; that men that fear God above others, are intrusted by God, yea, and by his church too, with the trust and ministration of spiritual things before any other in the world.",2.,For earthly things.,This fear of God qualifies a man to be put in trust with them rather than with another.,"Therefore God made Joseph lord of all Egypt; Obadiah, steward of Ahab's house; Daniel, Mordecai, and the three children, were set over the province of Babylon; and this by the wonderful working hand of God, because he had to dispose of earthly things now, not only in a common way, but for the good of his people in special.","True, when there is no special matter or thing to be done by God in a nation for his people, then who will (that is, whether they have grace or no) may have the disposal of those things; but if God has anything in special to bestow upon his people of this world's goods, then he will intrust it in the hands of men fearing God.","Joseph must now be made lord of Egypt, because Israel must be kept from starving; Obadiah must now be made steward of Ahab's house, because the Lord's prophets must be hid from and fed in despite of the rage and bloody mind of Jezebel; Daniel, with his companions, and Mordecai also, they were all exalted to earthly and temporal dignity, that they might in that state, they being men that abounded in the fear of God, be serviceable to their brethren in their straits and difficulties (Gen 42:18, 41:39; 1 Kings 18:3; Esth 6:10; Dan 2:48, 3:30, 5:29, 6:1-3).",Ninth.,"Another motive to grow in this grace of fear is, Where the fear of God in the heart of any is not growing, there no grace thrives, nor duty done as it should.","There no grace thrives, neither faith, hope, love, nor any grace.","This is evident from that general exhortation, ""Perfecting holiness in the fear of God"" (2 Cor 7:1).","Perfecting holiness, what is that?","but as James says of patience, let every grace have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing (James 1:4).","But this cannot be done but in the fear of God, yea, in the exercise of that grace, and so consequently in the growth of it, for there is no grace but grows by being exercised.","If then you would be perfect in holiness, if you would have every grace that God has put into your souls, grow and flourish into perfection; lay them, as I may say, a-soak in this grace of fear,[30] and do all in the exercise of it; for a little done in the fear of the Lord is better than the revenues of the wicked.","And again, the Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous, the soul that liveth in the fear of the Lord, to famish, but he casteth away the abundance of the wicked.","Bring abundance to God, and if it be not seasoned with godly fear, it shall not be acceptable to him, but loathsome and abominable in his sight; for it doth not flow from the spirit of the fear of the Lord.","Therefore, where there is not a growth in this fear, there is no duty done so acceptably.","This flows from that which goes before, for if grace rather decays than grows, where this grace of fear is not in the growth and increase thereof, then duties in their glory and acceptableness decay likewise.",Tenth.,"Another motive to stir thee up to grow in the increase of this grace of fear is, It is a grace, do but abound therein, that will give thee great boldness both with God and men.",Job was a man a none-such in his day for one that feared God; and who so bold with God as Job?,"who so bold with God, and who so bold with men as he?","How bold was he with God, when he wishes for nothing more than that he might come even to his seat, and concludes that if he could come at him, he would approach even as a prince unto him, and as such would order his cause before him (Job 23:3-7, 31:35-37).","Also before his friends, how bold was he?","For ever as they laid to his charge that he was an hypocrite, he repels them with the testimony of a good conscience, which good conscience he got, and kept, and maintained by increasing in the fear of God; yea, his conscience was kept so good by this grace of fear, for it was by that that he eschewed evil, that it was common with him to appeal to God when accused, and also to put himself for his clearing under most bitter curses and imprecations (Job 13:3-9, 18, 19:23,24, 31).","This fear of God is it that keeps the conscience clean and tender, and so free from much of that defilement that even a good man may be afflicted with, for want of his growth in this fear of God.","Yea, let me add, if a man can with a good conscience say that he desires to fear the name of God, it will add boldness to his soul in his approaches into the presence of God.","""O Lord,"" said Nehemiah, ""I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and servants, who desire to fear thy name"" (Neh 1:11).","He pleaded his desire of fearing the name of God, as an argument with God to grant him his request; and the reason was, because God had promised before ""to bless them that fear him, both small and great"" (Psa 115:13).",Eleventh.,"Another motive to stir you up to fear the Lord, and to grow in this fear is, By it thou mayest have thy labours blessed, to the saving of the souls of others.","It is said of Levi, of whom mention was made before, that he feared God and was afraid before his name--that he saved others from their sins.","""The law of truth was in his mouth, and he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn away many from iniquity"" (Mal 2:6).","The fear of God that dwelt in his heart, showed its growth in the sanctifying of the Lord by his life and words, and the Lord also blessed this his growth herein, by blessing his labours to the saving of his neighbours.","Wouldest thou save thy husband, thy wife, thy children, &c., then be greatly in the fear of God.","This Peter teaches, ""Wives,"" saith he, ""be in subjection to your own husbands, that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives, while they behold your chaste conversation, coupled with fear"" (1 Peter 3:1,2).","So then, if wives and children, yea, if husbands, wives, children, servants, &c., did but better observe this general rule of Peter, to wit, of letting their whole conversation be coupled with fear, they might be made instruments in God's hand of much more good than they are.","But the misery is, the fear of God is wanting in actions, and that is the cause that so little good is done by those that profess.","It is not a conversation that is coupled with a profession--for a great profession may be attended with a life that is not good, but scandalous; but it is a conversation coupled with fear of God--that is, with the impressions of the fear of God upon it--that is convincing and that ministereth the awakenings of God to the conscience, in order to saving the unbeliever.","O they are a sweet couple, to wit, a Christian conversation coupled with fear.",The want of this fear of God is that that has been a stumbling-block to the blind oftentimes.,"Alas, the world will not be convinced by your talk, by your notions, and by the great profession that you make, if they see not, therewith mixed, the lively impressions of the fear of God; but will, as I said, rather stumble and fall, even at your conversation and at your profession itself.","Wherefore, to prevent this mischief, that is, of stumbling of souls while you make your profession of God, by a conversation not becoming your profession, God bids you fear him; implying that a good conversation, coupled with fear, delivers the blind world from those falls that otherwise they cannot be delivered from.","""Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord"" (Lev 19:14).","But shalt fear thy God, that is the remedy that will prevent their stumbling at you, at what else soever they stumble.","Wherefore Paul says to Timothy, ""Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them; for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee"" (1 Tim 4:16).",Twelfth.,"Another motive to fear, and to grow in this fear of God is, This is the way to engage God to deliver thee from many outward dangers, whoever falls therein (Psa 34:7).",This is proved from that of the story of the Hebrew midwives.,"""The midwives,"" said Moses, ""feared God,"" and did not drown the men-children as the king had commanded, but saved them alive.",And what follows?,"""Therefore God dealt well with the midwives; and it came to pass because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses"" (Exo 1).","That is, he sheltered them and caused them to be hid from the rage and fury of the king, and that perhaps in some of the houses of the Egyptians themselves for why might not the midwives be there hid as well as was Moses even in the king's court?",[31] And how many times are they that fear God said to be delivered both by God and his holy angels?,as also I have already showed.,Thirteenth.,"Another motive to fear and to grow in this fear of God is, This is the way to be delivered from errors and damnable opinions.","There are some that perish in their righteousness, that is an error; there be some that perish in their wickedness, and that is an error also.","Some again prolong their lives by their wickedness, and others are righteous over-much, and also some are over-wise, and all these are snares, and pits, and holes.","But then, sayest thou, how shall I escape?","Indeed that is the question, and the Holy Ghost resolves it thus, ""He that feareth God shall come forth of them all"" (Eccl 7:18).",Fourteenth.,"Another motive to fear, and to grow in this fear of God, is, Such as have leave, be they never so dark in their souls, to come boldly to Jesus Christ, and to trust in him for life.","I told you before, that they that fear God have in the general a license to trust in him; but now I tell you, and that in particular, that they, and they especially, may do it, and that though in the dark; you that sit in darkness and have no light, if this grace of fear be alive in your hearts, you have this boldness--""Who is among you that feareth the Lord,"" mark, that feareth the Lord, ""that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light?","let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God"" (Isa 50:10).","It is no small advantage, you know, when men have to deal in difficult matters, to have a patent or license to deal; now to trust in the Lord is a difficult thing, yet the best and most gainful of all.","But then, some will say, since it is so difficult, how may we do without danger?","Why, the text gives a license, a patent to them to trust in his name, that have his fear in their hearts--""Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.""",[32] Fifteenth.,"Another motive to fear and grow in this grace of fear, is, God will own and acknowledge such to be his, whoever he rejecteth.","Yea he will distinguish and separate them from all others, in the day of his terrible judgments.","He will do with them as he did by those that sighed for the abominations that were done in the land--command the man that hath his ink-horn by his side ""to set a mark upon their foreheads,"" that they might not fall in that judgment with others (Eze 9).","So God said plainly of them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name, that they should be writ in his book--""A book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name; and they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels, and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him"" (Mal 3:16,17).","Mark, he both acknowledges them for his, and also promises to spare them, as a man would spare his own son; yea, and moreover, will wrap them up as his chief jewels with himself in the bundle of life.",Thus much for the motives.,How to grow in this fear of God.,"Having given you these motives to the duty of growing in this fear of God, before I leave this use, I will, in a few words, show you how you may grow in this fear of God.",First.,"Then, if thou wouldest grow in this fear of God, learn aright to distinguish of fear in general.","I mean, learn to distinguish between that fear that is godly, and that which in itself is indeed ungodly fear of God; and know them well the one from the other, lest the one, the fear that in itself indeed is ungodly, get the place, even the upper hand of that which truly is godly fear.","And remember the ungodly fear of God is by God himself counted an enemy to him, and hurtful to his people, and is therefore most plentifully forbidden in the Word (Gen 3:15, 26:24, 46:3; Exo 14:13, 20:20; Num 14:9, 21:34; Isa 41:10,14, 43:1, 44:2,8; 54:4; Jer 30:10; Dan 10:12,19; Joel 2:21; Hagg 2:5; Zech 8:13).",Second.,"If thou wouldest grow in this godly fear, learn rightly to distinguish it from that fear, in particular, that is godly but for a time; even from that fear that is wrought by the Spirit, as a spirit of bondage.","I say, learn to distinguish this from that, and also perfectly to know the bounds that God hath set to that fear that is wrought by the Spirit, as a spirit of bondage; lest, instead of growing in the fear that is to abide with thy soul for ever, thou be over-run again with that first fear, which is to abide with thee but till the spirit of adoption come.","And that thou mayest not only distinguish them one from the other, but also keep each in its due place and bounds, consider in general of what hath already been said upon this head, and in particular that the first fear is no more wrought by the Holy Spirit, but by the devil, to distress thee, and make thee to live, not like a son, but a slave.","And for thy better help in this matter, know that God himself hath set bounds to this fear, and has concluded that after the spirit of adoption is come, that other fear is wrought in thy heart by him no more (Rom 8:15; 2 Tim 1:7).","Again, before I leave this, let me tell thee that if thou dost not well bestir thee in this matter, this bondage fear, to wit, that which is like it, though not wrought in thee by the Holy Ghost, will, by the management and subtlety of the devil, the author of it, haunt, disturb, and make thee live uncomfortably, and that while thou art an heir of God and his kingdom.","This is that fear that the apostle speaks of, that makes men ""all their lifetime subject to bondage"" (Heb 2:14,15).","For though Christ will deliver thee indeed at last, thou having embraced him by faith, yet thy life will be full of trouble; and death, though Jesus hath abolished it, will be always a living bugbear to thee in all thy ways and thoughts, to break thy peace, and to make thee to draw thy loins heavily after him.",Third.,Wouldest thou grow in this godly fear?,"then, as thou shouldest learn to distinguish of fears, so thou shouldest make conscience of which to entertain and cherish.","If God would have his fear--and it is called HIS fear by way of eminency--""that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not"" (Exo 20:20; Jer 32:40)--I say, if God would have his fear be with thee, then thou shouldest make conscience of this, and not so lightly give way to slavish fear, as is common for Christians to do.","There is utterly a fault among Christians about this thing; that is, they make not that conscience of resisting of slavish fear as they ought; they rather cherish and entertain it, and so weaken themselves, and that fear that they ought to strengthen.","And this is the reason that we so often lie grabbling[33] under the black and amazing thoughts that are engendered in our hearts by unbelief; for this fear nourisheth unbelief; that is, now it doth, to wit, if we give way to it after the spirit of adoption is come, and readily closeth with all the fiery darts of the wicked.",But Christians are ready to do with this fear as the horse does when the tines[34] of the fork are set against his side; even lean to it until it entereth into his belly.,"We lean naturally to this fear, I mean, after God has done good to our souls; it is hard striving against it, because it has even our sense and feeling of its side.","But I say, if thou wouldest be a growing Christian--growing, I say, in the fear that is godly, in the fear that is always so--then make conscience of striving against the other, and against all these things that would bring thee back to it.","""Wherefore should I fear,"" said David, ""in the day of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?""",(Psa 49:5).,What!,not fear in the day of evil?,What!,not when the iniquity of thy heels compasseth thee about?,"No, not then, saith he, that is, not with that fear that would bring him again into bondage to the law; for he had received the spirit of adoption before.","Indeed, if ever a Christian has ground to give way to slavish fear, it is at these two times, to wit, in the day of evil, and when the iniquity of his heels compasseth him about; but you see, David would not then, no, not then, give way thereto, nor did he see reason why he should.","""Wherefore should I,"" said he?","Aye, wherefore indeed?","since now thou art become a son of God through Christ, and hast received the Spirit of his Son into thy heart, crying, Father, Father.",Fourth.,Wouldest thou grow in this grace of godly fear?,"then grow in the knowledge of the new covenant, for that is indeed the girdle of our reins, and the strength of our souls.","Hear what Zacharias saith: God, says he, ""hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began.""",But what was it?,what was it that he spake?,"Why, ""That he would grant unto us, that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve him without fear,"" without this slavish bondage fear, ""in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.""",But upon what is this princely fearless service of God grounded?,"Why, upon the holy covenant of God, upon the oath that he swore unto Abraham (Luke 1:69-74).","Now in this covenant is wrapped up all thy salvation; in it is contained all thy desire, and I am sure, that then it containeth the complete salvation of thy soul; and I say, since this covenant is confirmed by promise, by oath, and by the blood of the Son of God, and that on purpose that thou mightest serve thy God without slavish fear, then the knowledge and faith of this covenant is of absolute necessity to bring us into this liberty, and out of our slavish terrors, and so, consequently, to cause us to grow in that son-like, godly fear, which became even the Son of God himself, and becomes all his disciples to live in the growth and exercise of.",Fifth.,Wouldest thou grow in this godly fear?,"then labour even always to keep thine evidences for heaven and of thy salvation alive upon thy heart; for he that loseth his evidences for heaven, will hardly keep slavish fear out of heart; but he that hath the wisdom and grace to keep them alive, and apparent to himself, he will grow in this godly fear.","See how David words it, ""From the end of the earth,"" saith he, ""will I cry unto thee; when my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that is higher than I.","For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy: I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever.","For thou, O God, hast heard my vows; thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name"" (Psa 61:2-5).","Mark a little, David doth by these words, in the first place, suggest that sometimes, to his thinking, he was as far off of his God as the ends of the earth are asunder, and that at such times he was subject to be overwhelmed, afraid: [And] second, the way that he took at such times, to help himself, was to cry to God to lead him again to Jesus Christ--""lead me to the rock that is higher than I""; for indeed without faith in him, and the renewing of that faith, there can be no evidence for heaven made to appear unto the soul.",This therefore he prays for first.,"Then he puts that faith into exercise, and that with respect to the time that was past, and also of the time that was to come.","For the time past, says he, ""Thou hast been a shelter to me, and a strong tower from the enemy""; and for the time to come, he said, ""I will abide in thy tabernacle,"" that is, in thy Christ by faith, and in thy way of worship by love, ""forever.""","And observe it, he makes the believing remembrance of his first evidences for heaven the ground of this his cry and faith, ""For thou,"" says he, ""O God, hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.""","Thou hast made me meet to be a partaker of the mercy of thy chosen, and hast put me under the blessing of goodness wherewith thou hast blessed those that fear thee.","Thus you see how David, in his distresses, musters up his prayers, faith, and evidences for eternal life, that he might deliver himself from being overwhelmed, that is, with slavish fear, and that he might also abound in that son-like fear of his fellow-brethren, that is not only comely, with respect to our profession, but profitable to our souls.",Sixth.,Wouldest thou grow in this fear of God?,"then set before thine eyes the being and majesty of God; for that both begetteth, maintaineth, and increaseth this fear.","And hence it is called the fear of God, that is, an holy and awful dread and reverence of his majesty.","For the fear of God is to stand in awe of him, but how can that be done if we do not set him before us?","And again, if we would fear him more, we must abide more in the sense and faith of his glorious majesty.","Hence this fear and God's name is so often put together: as fear God, fear the Lord, fear thy God, do this in the fear of the Lord, and thou shalt fear thy God, I am the Lord.","For these words, ""I am the Lord thy God,"" and the like, are on purpose put in, not only to show us whom we should fear, but also to beget, maintain, and increase in us that fear that is due from us to that ""glorious and fearful name, the Lord our God"" (Deut 28:58).",Seventh.,Wouldest thou grow in this grace of fear?,"then keep always close to thy conscience the authority of the Word; fear the commandment as the commandment of a God both mighty and glorious, and as the commandment of a father, both loving and pitiful; let this commandment, I say, be always with thine eye, with thine ear, and with thine heart; for then thou wilt be taught, not only to fear, but to abound in the fear of the Lord.","Every grace is nourished by the Word, and without it there is no thrift in the soul (Prov 13:13, 4:20-22; Deut 6:1,2).",Eighth.,Wouldest thou grow in this grace of fear?,"then be much in the faith of the promise, of the promise that maketh over to thy soul an interest in God by Christ, and of all good things.","The promise naturally tendeth to increase in us the fear of the Lord, because this fear, it grows by goodness and mercy; they shall fear the Lord, and his goodness; now this goodness and mercy of God, it is wrapt up in, and made over to us by promise; for God gave it to Abraham by promise.","Therefore the faith and hope of the promise causeth this fear to grow in the soul--""Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God"" (2 Cor 7:1).","""Perfecting holiness in the fear of God""; therefore that fear by the promise must needs grow mighty, for by, with, and in it, you see holiness is perfected.",Ninth.,Wouldest thou grow in this grace of fear?,"then remember the judgments of God that have, or shall certainly overtake, those professors, that have either been downright hypocrites, or else unwatchful Christians.","For both these sorts partake of the judgments of God;

this is the way to grow in the grace of fear.,"Lastly, Wouldest thou grow in this grace of fear?",then devote thyself to it (Psa 119:38).,"Devote myself to it, you will say, how is that?","I answer, why, give thyself to it, addict thyself to it.","Solace thyself in the contemplation of God, and of a reverence of his name, and word, and worship.","Then wilt thou fear, and grow in this grace of fear.",What things they are that have a tendency in them to hinder the growth of the fear of God in our hearts.,"And that I may yet be helpful to thee, reader, I shall now give thee caution of those things that will, if way be given to them, hinder thy growth in this fear of God, the which, because they are very hurtful to the people of God, I would have thee be warned by them.",And they are these which follow: First.,"If thou wouldest grow in this grace of fear, take heed of A HARD HEART, for that will hinder thy growth in this grace.","""Why hast thou hardened our heart from thy fear?""","was a bitter complaint of the church heretofore; for it is not only the judgment that in itself is dreadful and sore to God's people, but that which greatly hindereth the growth of this grace in the soul (Isa 63:17).","A hard heart is but barren ground for any grace to grow in, especially for the grace of fear: there is but little of this fear where the heart is indeed hard; neither will there ever be much therein.","Now if thou wouldest be kept from a hard heart, 1.",Take heed of the beginnings of sin.,"Take heed, I say, of that, though it should be never so small; ""A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.""","There is more in a little sin to harden, than in a great deal of grace to soften.","David's look upon Bathsheba was, one would think, but a small matter; yet that beginning of sin contracted such hardness of heart in him, that it carried him almost beyond all fear of God.","It did carry him to commit lewdness with her, murder upon the body of Uriah, and to abundance of wicked dissimulation; which are things, I say, that have direct tendency to quench and destroy all fear of God in the soul.",2.,"If thou hast sinned, lie not down without repentance; for the want of repentance, after one has sinned, makes the heart yet harder and harder.","Indeed a hard heart is impenitent, and impenitence also makes the heart harder and harder.","So that if impenitence be added to hardness of heart, or to the beginning of sin which makes it so, it will quickly be with that soul, as is said of the house of Israel, it will have a whore's forehead, it will hardly be brought to shame (Jer 3:3).",3.,"If thou wouldest be rid of a hard heart, that great enemy to the growth of the grace of fear, be much with Christ upon the cross in thy meditations; for that is an excellent remedy against hardness of heart: a right sight of him, as he hanged there for thy sins, will dissolve thy heart into tears, and make it soft and tender.","""They shall look upon me whom they have pierced,--and mourn"" (Zech 12:10).","Now a soft, a tender, and a broken heart, is a fit place for the grace of fear to thrive in.","But, Second.","If thou wouldest have the grace of fear to grow in thy soul, take heed also of A PRAYERLESS HEART, for that is not a place for this grace of fear to grow in.",Hence he that restraineth prayer is said to cast off fear.,"""Thou castest off fear,"" said one of his friends to Job.",But how must he do that?,"Why the next words show, ""Thou restrainest prayer before God"" (Job 15:4).",Seest thou a professor that prayeth not?,that man thrusteth the fear of God away from him.,"Seest thou a man that prays but little, that man feareth God but little; for it is the praying soul, the man that is mighty in praying, that has a heart for the fear of God to grow in.","Take heed, therefore, of a prayerless heart, if you would grow in this grace of the fear of God.","Prayer is as the pitcher that fetcheth water from the brook, therewith to water the herbs; break the pitcher, and it will fetch no water, and for want of water the garden withers.",Third.,Wouldest thou grow in this grace of fear?,"then take heed of A LIGHT AND WANTON HEART, for neither is such a heart good ground for the fear of God to grow in.","Wherefore it is said of Israel, ""She feared not, but went and played the harlot also.""","She was given to wantonness, and to be light and vain, and so her fear of God decayed (Jer 3:8).","Had Joseph been as wanton as his mistress, he had been as void of the fear of God as she; but he was of a sober, tender, godly, considerate spirit, therefore he grew in the fear of God.",Fourth.,Wouldest thou grow in this grace of fear?,"then take heed of A COVETOUS HEART, for neither is that which is such an one good ground for this grace of fear to grow in.","Therefore this covetousness and the fear of God are as enemies, set the one in opposition to the other: one that feareth God and hateth covetousness (Exo 18:21).","And the reason why covetousness is such an obstruction to the growth of this grace of fear, is because covetousness casteth those things out of the heart which alone can nourish this fear.","It casteth out the Word and love of God, without which no grace can grow in the soul; how then should the fear of God grow in a covetous heart?",(Eze 33:30-32; 1 John 2:15).,Fifth.,Wouldest thou grow in this grace of fear?,"then take heed of AN UNBELIEVING HEART, for an unbelieving heart is not good ground for this grace of fear to grow in.","An unbelieving heart is called ""an evil heart,"" because from it flows all the wickedness that is committed in the world (Heb 3:12).","Now it is faith, or a believing heart, that nourisheth this fear of God, and not the other; and the reason is, for that faith brings God, heaven, and hell, to the soul, and maketh it duly consider of them all (Heb 11:7).","This is therefore the means of fear, and that which will make it grow in the soul; but unbelief is a bane thereto.",Sixth.,Wouldest thou grow in this grace of fear?,then take heed of A FORGETFUL HEART.,"Such a heart is not a heart where the grace of fear will flourish, ""when I remember, I am afraid,"" &c. Therefore take heed of forgetfulness; do not forget but remember God, and his kindness, patience, and mercy, to those that yet neither have grace, nor special favour from him, and that will beget and nourish his fear in thy heart, but forgetfulness of this, or of any other of his judgments, is a great wound and weakening to this fear (Job 21:6).","When a man well remembers that God's judgments are so great a deep and mystery, as indeed they are, that remembrance puts a man upon such considerations of God and of his judgments as to make him fear--""Therefore,"" said Job, ""I am afraid of him.""","See the place, Job 23:15.","""Therefore am I troubled at his presence; when I consider, I am afraid of him""--when I remember and consider of the wonderful depths of his judgments towards man.",Seventh.,Wouldest thou grow in this grace of fear?,"then take heed of A MURMURING AND REPINING HEART, for that is not a heart for this grace of fear to grow in.","As for instance, when men murmur and repine at God's hand, at his dispensations, and at the judgments that overtake them, in their persons, estates, families, or relations, that their murmuring tendeth to destroy fear; for a murmuring spirit is such an one as seems to correct God, and to find fault with his dispensations, and where there is that, the heart is far from fear.","A murmuring spirit either comes from that wisdom that pretends to understand that there is a failure in the nature and execution of things, or from an envy and spite at the execution of them.","Now if murmurings arise from this pretended wisdom of the flesh, then instead of fearing of God, his actions are judged to be either rigid or ridiculous, which yet are done in judgment, truth, and righteousness.",So that a murmuring heart cannot be a good one for the fear of God to grow in.,Alas!,"the heart where that grows must be a soft one; as you have it in Job 23:15, 16; and a heart that will stoop and be silent at the most abstruse of all his judgments--""I was dumb, because THOU didst it.""","The heart in which this fear of God doth flourish is such, that it bows and is mute, if it can but espy the hand, wisdom, justice, or holiness of God in this or the other of his dispensations, and so stirs up the soul to fear before him.","But if this murmuring ariseth from envy and spite, that looketh so like to the spirit of the devil, that nothing need be said to give conviction of the horrible wickedness of it.",Eighth.,Wouldest thou grow in this grace of fear?,"then take heed of A HIGH AND CAPTIOUS SPIRIT, for that is not good ground for the fear of God to grow in.","A meek and quiet spirit is the best, and there the fear of God will flourish most; therefore Peter puts meekness and fear together, as being most suited in their nature and natural tendency one to another (1 Peter 3:15).","Meekness of spirit is like that heart that hath depth of earth in it in which things may take root and grow; but a high and captious spirit is like to the stony ground, where there is not depth of earth, and consequently, where this grace of fear cannot grow; therefore take heed of this kind of spirit, if thou wouldest that the fear of God should grow in thy soul.",Ninth.,Wouldest thou grow in this grace of fear?,"then take heed of AN ENVIOUS HEART, for that is not a good heart for the fear of God to grow in.","""Let not thine heart envy sinners; but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long"" (Prov 23:17).","To envy any is a sign of a bad spirit, and that man takes upon him, as I have already hinted, to be a controller and a judge, yea, and a malicious executioner too, and that of that fury that ariseth from his own lusts and revengeful spirit, upon (perhaps) the man that is more righteous than himself.","But suppose he is a sinner that is the object of thine envy, why, the text sets that envy in direct opposition to the fear of God; ""Envy not sinners, but be thou in the fear of God.""","These two, therefore, to wit, envy to sinners and fearing of God, are opposites.","Thou canst not fear God, and envy sinners too.","And the reason is, because he that envieth a sinner, hath forgotten himself, that he is as bad; and how can he then fear God?","He that envies sinners rejects his duty of blessing of them that curse, and praying for them that despitefully use us; and how can he that hath rejected this, fear God?","He that envieth sinners, therefore, cannot be of a good spirit, nor can the fear of God grow in his heart.",Tenth.,"Lastly, Wouldest thou grow in this grace of fear?","then take heed of HARDENING THY HEART at any time against convictions to particular duties, as to prayer, alms, self-denial, or the like.","Take heed also of hardening thy heart, when thou art under any judgment of God, as sickness, losses, crosses, or the like.","I bid you before to beware of a hard heart, but now I bid you beware of hardening your soft ones.","For to harden the heart is to make it worse than it is; harder, more desperate, and bold against God, than at the present it is.","Now, I say, if thou wouldest grow in this grace of fear, take heed of hardening thy heart, and especially of hardening of it against convictions to good; for those convictions are sent of God like seasonable showers of rain, to keep the tillage of thy heart in good order, that the grace of fear may grow therein; but this stifling of convictions makes the heart as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.","Therefore happy is he that receiveth conviction, for so he doth keep in the fear of God, and that fear thereby nourished in his soul; but cursed is he that doth otherwise--""Happy is the man that feareth alway; but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief"" (Prov 28:14).","USE THIRD, of encouragement.",USE THIRD.,I come now to A USE OF ENCOURAGEMENT to those that are blessed with this grace of fear.,"The last text that was mentioned saith, ""Happy is the man that feareth alway,"" and so doth many more.","Happy already, because blessed with this grace; and happy for time to come, because this grace shall abide, and continue till the soul that hath it is brought unto the mansion-house of glory.","""I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.""","Therefore, as here it saith, Happy is he, so it saith also, It shall go well with him, that is, in time to come.","""It shall be well with them that fear God"" (Eccl 8:12).",First.,"Had God given thee all the world, yet cursed hadst thou been, if he had not given thee the fear of the Lord; for the fashion of this world is a fading thing, but he that feareth the Lord shall abide for ever and ever.","This therefore is the first thing that I would propound for thy encouragement, thou man that fears the Lord.","This grace will dwell in thy heart, for it is a new covenant grace, and will abide with thee for ever.","It is sent to thee from God, not only to join thy heart unto him, but to keep thee from final apostasy--""I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me"" (Jer 32:40).","That thou mayest never forsake God, is his design, and therefore, to keep thee from that wicked thing, he hath put his fear in thy heart.","Many are the temptations, difficulties, snares, traps, trials, and troubles that the people of God pass through in the world, but how shall they be kept, how shall they be delivered, and escape?","Why, the answer is, The fear of God will keep them--""He that feareth God shall come forth of them all.""","Is it not therefore a wonderful mercy to be blessed with this grace of fear, that thou by it mayest be kept from final, which is damnable apostasy?","Bless God, therefore, thou blessed man, that hast this grace of fear in thy soul.",There are five things in this grace of fear that have a direct tendency in them to keep thee from final apostasy.,1.,"It is seated in the heart, and the heart is, as I may call it, the main fort in the mystical world, man.","It is not placed in the head, as knowledge is; nor in the mouth, as utterance is, but in the heart, the seat of all, ""I will put my fear in their hearts.""","If a king will keep a town secure to himself, let him be sure to man sufficiently the main fort thereof.","If he have twenty thousand men well armed, yet if they lie scattered here and there, the town may be taken for all that, but if the main fort be well manned, then the town is more secure.","What if a man had all the parts, yea, all the arts of men and angels?",That will not keep the heart to God.,"But when the heart, this principal fort, is possessed with the fear of God, then he is safe, but not else.",2.,"As the heart in general, so the will in special.",That chief and great faculty of the soul is the principle that is acted by this fear.,"The will, which way that goes, all goes; if it be to heaven or hell.","Now the will, I say, is that main faculty that is governed by this fear that doth possess the soul, therefore all is like to go well with it.","This Samuel insinuateth, where he saith, ""If ye will fear the Lord.""","Fearing of God is a voluntary act of the will, and that being so, the soul is kept from rebellion against the commandment, because by the will where this fear of God is placed, and which it governeth, is led all the rest of the powers of the soul (1 Sam 12:14).","In this will, then, is this fear of God placed, that this grace may the better be able to govern the soul, and so by consequence the whole man; for as I said before, look what way the will goes, look what the will does, thither goes, and that does, the whole man (Psa 110:3).","Man, when his will is alienate from God, is reckoned rebellious throughout, and that not without ground, for the will is the principal faculty of the soul as to obedience, and therefore things done without the will are as if they were not done at all.","The spirit is willing; if ye be willing; ""she hath done what she could,"" and the like; by these and such-like sayings the goodness of the heart and action is judged, as to the subjective part thereof.","Now this fear that we have been speaking of, is placed in the soul, and so consequently in the will, that the man may thereby the better be kept from final and damnable apostasy.",3.,"This fear, as I may say, even above every other grace, is God's well-wisher; and hence it is called, as I also have showed you, his fear.","As he also says in the text mentioned above, ""I will put my fear in their hearts.""","These words, his and my, they are intimate and familiar expressions, bespeaking not only great favour to man, but a very great trust put in him.","As who should say, this fear is my special friend, it will subject and bow the soul, and the several faculties thereof, to my pleasure; it is my great favourite, and subdueth sinners to my pleasure.","You shall rarely find faith or repentance, or parts, go under such familiar characters as this blessed fear of the Lord doth.","Of all the counsellors and mighties that David had, Hushai only was called the king's friend (2 Sam 15:37, 16:16).","So of all the graces of the Spirit this of the fear of God goes mostly, if not always, by the title of MY fear, God's fear, HIS fear, &c. I told you before, if the king will keep a town, the main fort therein must be sufficiently manned: and now I will add, that if he have not to govern those men some trusty and special friend, such as Hushai was to David, he may find it lost when it should stand him in greatest stead.","If a soul should be possessed with all things possible, yet if this fear of God be wanting, all other things will give place in time of rebellion, and the soul shall be found in, and under the conduct of hell, when it should stand up for God and his truth in the world.","This fear of God, it is God's special friend, and therefore it has given unto it the chief seat of the heart, the will, that the whole man may now be, and also be kept hereafter, in the subjection and obedience of the gospel.","For, 4.",This grace of fear is the softest and most tender of God's honour of any other grace.,"It is that tender, sensible, and trembling grace, that keepeth the soul upon its continual watch.","To keep a good watch is, you know, a wonderful safety to a place that is in continual danger because of the enemy.","Why, this is the grace that setteth the watch, and that keepeth the watchmen awake (Can 3:7,8).","A man cannot watch as he should, if he be destitute of fear: let him be confident, and he sleeps; he unadvisedly lets into the garrison those that should not come there.","Israel's fault when they came to Canaan was, that they made a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, to wit, the Gibeonites, without asking counsel of God.","But would they have done so, think you, if at the same time the fear of God had had its full play in the soul, in the army?","no, they at that time forgot to fear.",The grace of fear had not at that time its full stroke and sway among them.,5.,"This grace of fear is that which, as I may so say, first affects the hearts of saints with judgments, after we have sinned, and so is as a beginning grace to bring again that to rights that by sin is put out of frame.",O it is a precious grace of God!,"I know what I say in this matter, and also where I had been long ago, through the power of my lusts, and the wiles of the devil, had it not been for the fear of God.",Second.,"But secondly, another encouragement for those that are blessed with this blessed grace of fear is this,--this fear fails not to do this work for the soul, if there in truth, be it never so small in measure.","A little of this leaven ""leaveneth the whole lump.""","True, a little will not do, or help the soul to do those worthy exploits in the heart or life as well as a bigger measure thereof; nor, indeed, can a little of any grace do that which a bigger measure will; but a little will preserve the soul from final apostasy, and deliver it into the arms of the Son of God at the final judgment.","Wherefore, when he saith, ""I will put my fear in their hearts,"" he says not, I will put so much of it there, such a quantity, or such a degree; but, ""I will put my fear there.""",I speak not this in the least to tempt the godly man to be content with the least degree of the fear of God in his heart.,"True, men should be glad that God hath put even the least degree of this grace into their souls, but they should not be content therewith; they should earnestly covet more, pray for more, and use all lawful, that is, all the means of God's appointing, that they may get more.","There are, as I have said already, several degrees of this grace of fear, and our wisdom is to grow in it, as in all the other graces of the Spirit.","The reasons why, I have showed you, and also the way to grow therein; but the least measure thereof will do as I said, that is, keep the soul from final apostasy.","There are, as I have showed you, those that greatly fear the Lord, that fear exceedingly, and that fear him above many of their brethren; but the small in this grace are saved as well as those that are great therein: ""He will bless"" or save ""them that fear him, both small and great.""","This fear of the Lord is the pulse of the soul; and as some pulses beat stronger, some weaker, so is this grace of fear in the soul.","They that beat best are a sign of best life, but they that beat worst show that life is [barely] present.","As long as the pulse beats, we count not that the man is dead, though weak; and this fear, where it is, preserves to everlasting life.","Pulses there are also that are intermitting; to wit, such as have their times for a little, a little time to stop, and beat again; true, these are dangerous pulses, but yet too a sign of life.","This fear of God also is sometimes like this intermitting pulse; there are times when it forbears to work, and then it works again.","David had an intermitting pulse, Peter had an intermitting pulse, as also many other of the saints of God.","I call that an intermitting pulse, with reference to the fear we speak of, when there is some obstruction by the workings of corruptions in the soul; I say, some obstruction from, and hindrance of, the continual motion of this fear of God; yet none of these, though they are various, and some of them signs of weakness, are signs of death, but life.","""I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.""",Quest.,"But you may say, How shall I know that I fear God?",Answ.,"If I should say that desires, true sincere desires to fear him, is fear itself.",I should not say amiss (Neh 1:11).,"For although a desire to be, or do so and so, makes not a man to be in temporal or natural things what he desires to be--for a sick, or poor, or imprisoned man may desire to be well, to be rich, or to be at liberty, and yet be as they are, sick, poor, or in prison--yet in spirituals, a man's desire to be good, to believe, to love, to hope, and fear God, doth flow from the nature of grace itself.","I said before, that in temporals a man could not properly be said to be what he was not; yet a man, even in naturals or temporals, shows his love to that thing that he desires, whether it be health, riches, or liberty; and in spirituals, desires of, from love to this or that grace of God, sincere desires of it flow from the root of the grace itself--""Thy servants who desire to fear thy name.""","Nehemiah bore himself before God upon this, ""that he desired to fear his name.""","And hence again it is said concerning desires, true desires, ""The desire of man is his kindness"" (Prov 19:22).","For a man shows his heart, his love, his affections, and his delights, in his desires; and since the grace of the fear of God is a grace so pleasant in the sight of God, and of so sanctifying a nature in the soul where it is, a true sincere desire to be blessed with that grace must needs flow from some being of this grace in the soul already.","True desires are lower than higher acts of grace, but God will not overlook desires--""But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.""","Mark, they desire a country, and they shall have a city.","At this low place, to wit, sincere desires, God will meet the soul and will tell him that he hath accepted of his desires, that his desires are his kindness, and flow from grace itself: ""He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him.""","Therefore desires are not rejected of God; but they would, if they did not flow from a principle of grace already in the soul; therefore desires, sincere desires to fear God, flow from grace already in the soul.","Therefore, since thou fearest God, and it is evident by thy desires that thou dost so do, thou art happy now in this thy fear, and shalt be happy for ever hereafter in the enjoyment of that which God in another world hath laid up for them that fear him.",Third.,"Another encouragement for those that have this grace of fear is this; this grace can make that man, that in many other things is not capable of serving of God, serve him better than those that have all without it.","Poor Christian man, thou hast scarce been able to do anything for God all thy days, but only to fear the Lord.","Thou art no preacher, and so canst not do him service that way; thou art no rich man, and so canst not do him service with outward substance; thou art no wise man, and so canst not do anything that way; but here is thy mercy, thou fearest God.","Though thou canst not preach, thou canst fear God.","Though thou hast no bread to feed the belly, nor fleece to clothe the back of the poor, thou canst fear God.","O how ""blessed is the man that feareth the Lord""; because this duty of fearing of God is an act of the mind, and may be done by the man that is destitute of all things but that holy and blessed mind.","Blessed therefore is that man, for God hath not laid the comfort of his people in the doing of external duties, nor the salvation of their souls, but in believing, loving, and fearing God.","Neither hath he laid these things in actions done in their health nor in the due management of their most excellent parts, but in the receiving of Christ, and fear of God.","The which, good Christian, thou mayest do, and do acceptably, even though thou shouldest lie bed-rid all thy days; thou mayest also be sick and believe; be sick and love, be sick and fear God, and so be a blessed man.","And here the poor Christian hath something to answer them that reproach him for his ignoble pedigree, and shortness of the glory of the wisdom of the world.","True, may that man say, I was taken out of the dunghill, I was born in a base and low estate, but I fear God.","I have no worldly greatness, nor excellency of natural parts, but I fear God.","When Obadiah met with Elijah, he gave him no worldly and fantastical compliment, nor did he glory in his promotion by Ahab the king of Israel, but gravely, and after a gracious manner, said, ""I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth.""","Also when the mariners inquired of Jonah, saying, ""What is thine occupation, and whence comest thou?","what is thy country, and of what people art thou?""","This was the answer he gave them, ""I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land"" (Jonah 1:8,9).","Indeed this answer is the highest, and most noble in the world, nor are there any, save a few, that in truth can thus express themselves, though other answers they had enough; most can say, I have wisdom, or might, or riches, or friends, or health, or the like; these are common, and are greatly boasted in by the most; but he is the man that feareth God, and he that can say, when they say to him, What art thou?","""I thy servant fear the Lord,"" he is the man of many, he is to be honoured of men: though this, to wit, that he feareth the Lord, is all that he hath in the world.","He hath the thing, the honour, the life, and glory that is lasting; his blessedness will abide when all men's but his is buried in the dust, in shame and contempt.",[35] A word to hypocrites.,"Hypocrites, my last word is to you; the hypocrite is one that would appear to be that in men's eyes that is nothing of in God's--thou hypocrite, that wouldest be esteemed to be one that loves and that fears God, but does not; I have this to say to thee, thy condition is damnable, because thou art a hypocrite, and seekest to deceive both God and man with guises, vizards, masks, shows, pretences, and thy formal, carnal, feigned subjection to the outside of statutes, laws, and commandments; but within thou art full of rottenness and all excess.","Hypocrite, thou mayest by thy cunning shifts be veiled and hid from men, but thou art naked before the eyes of God, and he knoweth that his fear is not in thy heart (Luke 16:15).","Hypocrite, be admonished that there is not obedience accepted of God, where the heart is destitute of this grace of fear.","Keeping of the commandments is but one part of the duty of man, and Paul did that, even while he was a hypocrite (Phil 3).","To ""fear God and keep his commandments, this is the whole duty of man"" (Eccl 12:13).","This--fear God--the hypocrite, as a hypocrite, cannot do, and therefore, as such, cannot escape the damnation of hell.","Hypocrite, thou must fear God first, even before thou dost offer to meddle with the commandments, that is, as to the keeping of them.","Indeed, thou shouldest read therein, that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord, but yet, ""fear God"" goes before the command to keep his commandments.","And if thou dost not fear God first, thou transgressest, instead of keeping of the commandments.","Hypocrite, this word, FEAR GOD, is that which the hypocrite quite forgets, although it is that which sanctifies the whole duty of man.","For this is that, and nothing without it, that can make a man sincere in his obedience; the hypocrite looks for applause abroad, and forgets that he is condemned at home, and both these he does because he wanteth the fear of God.","Hypocrite, be admonished that none of the privileges that are spoken of in the former part of the book belongs to thee, because thou art a hypocrite;

and Bunyan's first work on ""Gospel Truths"" was published to correct them.","Then followed that alarm to thoughtless souls--""A Few Sighs from Hell""; and, in 1659, as a further declaration of the most important truths of revelation, this work on the two covenants was sent forth to chastise error, and comfort the saints of God.","It was published many times during the author's life; and since then, to a late period, very large impressions have been circulated.","Upon a subject of such vast importance--upon which hangs all our eternal interests--all our indescribable joys or sorrows in a future and never-ending state--the requirements of our Creator--and His gracious provision of pardoning mercy, upon our failing to keep His Law--these are subjects of intense interest.",How important is it that all our researches into these solemn realities should be guided simply by the revealed will of God!,"That was the fountain at which Bunyan drunk in all his knowledge; and with simplicity, and most earnest desire to promote the glory of God in the salvation of sinners, he here gives the result of his patient, prayerful, painful investigation.",The humble dependence upon Divine mercy which the author felt is very striking.,"He was sensible of his want of education; ""no vain, whimsical, scholar-like terms""--no philosophy from Plato or Aristotle.","He felt, as to human teaching, his weakness, but proved that, ""when he was weak, then was he strong.""","He claimed an interest in the fervent prayers of his fellow saints--""My heart is vile, the devil lieth at watch, trust myself I dare not;

and all because there is not, together with the Gospel, mingled the doctrine of the law, which is not a right dispensing of the Word according to truth and knowledge.","Again; if there be the terror, horror, and severity of the law discovered to a people by the servants of Jesus Christ, though they do not speak of it to the end people should trust to it, by relying on it as it is a covenant of works; but rather that they should be driven further from that covenant, even to embrace the tenders and privileges of the second, yet, poor souls, because they are unacquainted with the natures of these two covenants, or either of them, therefore, ""they say,"" ""Here is nothing but preaching of the law, thundering of the law""; when, alas, if these two be not held forth--to wit, the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace, together with the nature of the one and the nature of the other--souls will never be able either to know what they are by nature or what they lie under.","Also, neither can they understand what grace is, nor how to come from under the law to meet God in and through that other most glorious covenant, through which and only through which, God can communicate of Himself grace, glory, yea, even all the good things of another world.","I, having considered these things, together with others, have made bold to present yet once more to thy view, my friend, something of the mind of God, to the end, if it shall be but blessed to thee, thou mayest be benefited thereby; for verily these things are not such as are ordinary and of small concernment, but do absolutely concern thee to know, and that experimentally too, if ever thou do partake of the glory of God through Jesus Christ, and so escape the terror and insupportable vengeance that will otherwise come upon thee through His justice, because of thy living and dying in thy transgressions against the Law of God.","And therefore, while thou livest here below, it is thy duty, if thou wish thyself happy for the time to come, to give up thyself to the studying of these two covenants treated of in the ensuing discourse; and so to study them until thou, through grace, do not only get the notion of the one and of the other in thy head, but until thou do feel the very power, life, and glory of the one and of the other: for take this for granted, he that is dark as touching the scope, intent, and nature of the law, is also dark as to the scope, nature, and glory of the Gospel; and also he that hath but a notion of the one, will barely have any more than a notion of the other.","And the reason is this: because so long as people are ignorant of the nature of the law, and of their being under it--that is, under the curse and condemning power of it, by reason of their sin against it--so long they will be careless, and negligent as to the inquiring after the true knowledge of the Gospel.","Before the commandment came--that is, in the spirituality of it--Paul was alive--that is, thought himself safe; which is clear, (Rom 7:9,10 compared with Phil 3:5-11, etc).","But when that came, and was indeed discovered unto him by the Spirit of the Lord, then Paul dies (Rom 7) to all his former life (Phil 3) and that man which before could content himself to live, though ignorant of the Gospel, cries out now, ""I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord"" (verse 8).","Therefore, I say, so long they will be ignorant of the nature of the Gospel, and how glorious a thing it is to be found within the bounds of it; for we use to say, that man that knoweth not himself to be sick, that man will not look out for himself a physician; and this Christ knew full well when He saith, ""The whole have no need of the physician, but the sick"";1 that is, none will in truth desire the physician unless they know they be sick.","That man also that hath got but a notion of the law--a notion, that is, the knowledge of it in the head, so as to discourse and talk of it--if he hath not felt the power of it, and that effectually too, it is to be feared will at the best be but a notionist in the Gospel; he will not have the experimental knowledge of the same in his heart; nay, he will not seek nor heartily desire after it; and all because, as I said before, he hath not experience of the wounding, cutting, killing nature of the other.","I say, therefore, if thou wouldst know the authority and power of the Gospel, labour first to know the power and authority of the law; for I am verily persuaded that the want of this one thing--namely, the knowledge of the law, is one cause why so many are ignorant of the other.","That man that doth know the law doth not know in deed and in truth that he is a sinner; and that man that doth not know he is a sinner, doth not know savingly that there is a Saviour.","Again; that man that doth not know the nature of the law, that man doth not know the nature of sin; and that man that knoweth not the nature of sin, will not regard to know the nature of a Saviour; this is proved (John 8:31-36).","These people were professors, and yet did not know the truth--the Gospel; and the reason was, because they did not know themselves, and so not the law.","I would not have thee mistake me, Christian reader; I do not say that the law of itself will lead any soul to Jesus Christ; but the soul being killed by the law, through the operation of its severity seizing on the soul, then the man, if he be enlightened by the Spirit of Christ to see where remedy is to be had, will not, through grace, be contented without the real and saving knowledge through faith of Him.","If thou wouldst, then, wash thy face clean, first take a glass and see where it is dirty; that is, if thou wouldst indeed have thy sins washed away by the blood of Christ, labour first to see them in the glass of the law, and do not be afraid to see thy besmeared condition, but look on every spot thou hast; for he that looks on the foulness of his face by the halves, will wash by the halves; even so, he that looks on his sins by the halves, he will seek for Christ by the halves.","Reckon thyself, therefore, I say, the biggest sinner in the world, and be persuaded that there is none worse than thyself; then let the guilt of it seize on thy heart, then also go in that case and condition to Jesus Christ, and plunge thyself into His merits and the virtue of His blood; and after that, thou shalt speak of the things of the law and of the Gospel experimentally, and the very language of the children of God shall feelingly drop from thy lips, and not till then (James 1).","Let this therefore learn thee thus much: he that hath not seen his lost condition hath not seen a safe condition; he that did never see himself in the devil's snare, did never see himself in Christ's bosom.","""This my Son was dead, and is alive again: he was lost, and is found.""","""Among whom we also had our conversation in time past.""","2 ""But now are (so many of us as believe) returned unto"" Jesus Christ, ""the"" chief ""Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.""","I say, therefore, if thou do find in this treatise, in the first place, something touching the nature, end, and extent of the law, do not thou cry out, therefore, all of a sudden, saying, ""Here is nothing but the terror, horror, and thundering sentences of the law.""","Again; if thou do find in the second part of this discourse something of the freeness and fullness of the Gospel, do not thou say neither, ""Here is nothing but grace, therefore, surely, an undervaluing of the law.""","No; but read it quite through, and so consider of it; and I hope thou shalt find the two covenants--which all men are under, either the one or the other--discovered, and held forth in their natures, ends, bounds, together with the state and condition of them that are under the one, and of them that are under the other.","There be some that through ignorance do say how that such men as preach terror and amazement to sinners are beside the book, and are ministers of the letter--the law, and not of the Spirit--the Gospel; but I would answer them, citing them to the Sixteenth of Luke, from the nineteenth verse to the end; and (1 Cor 6:9,10; Gal 3:10; Rom 3:9-19) only this caution I would give by the way, how that they which preach terror to drive souls to the obtaining of salvation by the works of the law, that preaching is not the right Gospel preaching; yet when saints speak of the sad state that man are in by nature, to discover to souls their need of the Gospel, this is honest preaching, and he that doth do so, he doth the work of a Gospel minister (Rom 3:9-25).","Again, there are others that say, because we do preach the free, full, and exceeding grace discovered in the Gospel, therefore we make void the law; when indeed, unless the Gospel be held forth in the glory thereof without confusion, by mingling the Covenant of Works therewith, the law cannot be established.","""Do we then make void the law through faith,"" or preaching of the Gospel; nay, stay, saith Paul, ""God forbid: yea, we establish the law"" (Rom 3:31).","And verily, he that will indeed establish the law, or set it in its own place, for so I understand the words, must be sure to hold forth the Gospel in its right colour and nature; for if a man be ignorant of the nature of the Gospel and the Covenant of Grace, they, or he, will be very apt to remove the law out of its place, and that because they are ignorant, not knowing ""what they say, nor whereof they affirm.""","And let me tell you, if a man be ignorant of the Covenant of Grace, and the bounds and boundlessness of the Gospel, though he speak and make mention of the name of the Father, and of the Son, and also of the name of the new covenant, and the blood of Christ, yet at this very time, and in these very words, he will preach nothing but the law, and that as a Covenant of Works.","Reader, I must confess it is a wonderfully mysterious thing, and he had need have a wiser spirit than his own that can rightly set these two covenants in their right places, that when he speaks of the one he doth not jostle the other out of its place.","O, to be so well enlightened as to speak of the one--that is, the law--for to magnify the Gospel; and also to speak of the Gospel so as to establish, and yet not to idolize, the law, nor any particular thereof!","It is rare, and to be heard and found but in very few men's breasts.","If thou shouldst say, What is it to speak to each of these two covenants so as to set them in their right places, and also to use the terror of the one so as to magnify and advance the glory of the other?","To this I shall answer also, read the ensuing discourse, but with an understanding heart, and it is like thou wilt find a reply therein to the same purpose, which may be to thy satisfaction.","Reader, if thou do find this book empty of fantastical expressions, and without light, vain, whimsical, scholar-like terms, thou must understand it is because I never went to school to Aristotle, or Plato, but was brought up at my father's house, in a very mean condition, among a company of poor countrymen.","But if thou do find a parcel of plain, yet sound, true, and home sayings, attribute that to the Lord Jesus His gifts and abilities, which He hath bestowed upon such a poor creature as I am and have been.","And if thou, being a seeing Christian, dost find me coming short, though rightly touching at some things, attribute that either to my brevity, or, if thou wilt, to my weaknesses, for I am full of them.","A word or two more, and so I shall have done with this.",First.,"And the first is, Friend, if thou do not desire the salvation of thy soul, yet I pray thee to read this book over with serious consideration; it may be it will stir up in thee some desires to look out after it, which at present thou mayest be without.","Secondly, If thou dost find any stirrings in thy heart by thy reading such an unworthy man's works as mine are, be sure that in the first place thou give glory to God, and give way to thy convictions, and be not too hasty in getting them off from thy conscience; but let them so work till thou dost see thyself by nature void of all graces, as faith, hope, knowledge of God, Christ, and the Covenant of Grace.","Thirdly, Then, in the next place, fly in all haste to Jesus Christ, thou being sensible of thy lost condition without Him, secretly persuading of thy soul that Jesus Christ standeth open-armed to receive thee, to wash away thy sins, to clothe thee with His righteousness, and is willing, yea, heartily willing, to present thee before the presence of the glory of God and among the innumerable company of angels with exceeding joy.","This being thus, in the next place, do not satisfy thyself with these secret and first persuasions, which do or may encourage thee to come to Jesus Christ; but be restless till thou dost find by blessed experience the glorious glory of this the second covenant extended unto thee, and sealed upon thy soul with the very Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ.","And that thou mayest not slight this my counsel, I beseech thee, in the second place, consider these following things-- First, If thou dost get off thy convictions, and not the right way (which is by seeing thy sins washed away by the blood of Jesus Christ), it is a question whether ever God will knock at thy heart again or no; but rather say, such an one ""is joined to idols, let him alone"" (Hosea 4:17).","Though he be in a natural state, ""let him alone.""","Though he be in or under the curse of the law, ""let him alone.""","Though he be in the very hand of the devil, ""let him alone.""","Though he be a-going post-haste to Hell, ""let him alone.""","Though his damnation will not only be damnation for sins against the law, but also for slighting the Gospel, yet ""let him alone.""","My Spirit, My ministers, My Word, My grace, My mercy, My love, My pity, My common providences, shall no more strive with him; ""let him alone.""",O sad!,O miserable!,"who would slight convictions that are on their souls, which (if not slighted) tend so much for their good?","Secondly, If thou shalt not regard how thou do put off convictions, but put them off without the precious blood of Christ being savingly applied to thy soul, thou art sure to have the mis-spending of that conviction to prove the hardening of thy heart against the next time thou art to hear the Word preached or read.","This is commonly seen, that those souls that have not regarded those convictions that are at first set upon their spirits, do commonly, and that by the just judgments of God upon them, grow more hard, more senseless, more seared and sottish in their spirits; for some, who formerly would quake and weep, and relent under the hearing of the Word, do now for the present sit so senseless, so seared, and hardened in their consciences, that certainly if they should have hell-fire thrown in their faces, as it sometimes cried up in their ears, they would scarce be moved; and this comes upon them as a just judgment of God (2 Thess 2:11,12).","Thirdly, If thou do slight these, or those convictions that may be set upon thy heart by reading of this discourse, or hearing of any other good man preach the Word of God sincerely, thou wilt have the stifling of these or those convictions to account and answer for at the day of judgment; not only thy sins, that are commonly committed by thee in thy calling and common discourse, but thou shalt be called to a reckoning for slighting convictions, disregarding of convictions, which God useth as a special means to make poor sinners see their lost condition and the need of a Saviour.","Now here I might add many more considerations besides these, to the end thou mayest be willing to tend and listen to convictions; as, First, Consider thou hast a precious soul, more worth than the whole world; and this is commonly worked upon, if ever it be saved, by convictions.","Secondly, This soul is for certain to go to Hell, if thou shalt be a slighter of convictions.","Thirdly, If that go to Hell, thy body must go thither too, and then never to come out again.","""Now consider this, ye that"" are apt to ""forget God,"" and His convictions, ""lest He tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver"" (Psa 50:22).","But if thou shalt be such an one that shall, notwithstanding thy reading of thy misery, and also of God's mercy, shall persist to go on in thy sins, know, in the first place, that here thou shalt be left, by the things that thou readest, without excuse; and in the world to come thy damnation will be exceedingly aggravated for thy not regarding of them, and turning from thy sins, which were not only reproved by them, but also for rejecting of that Word of Grace that did instruct thee how and which way thou shouldst be saved from them.","And so farewell; I shall leave thee, and also this discourse, to God, who I know will pass a righteous judgment both upon that and thee.","I am yours, though not to serve your lusts and filthy minds, yet to reprove, instruct, and, according to that proportion of faith and knowledge which God hath given me, to declare unto you the way of life and salvation.","Your judgings, railings, surmisings, and disdaining of me, that I shall leave till the fiery judgment comes, in which the offender shall not go unpunished, be he you or me; yet I shall pray for you, wish well to you, and do you what good I can.","And that I might not write or speak in vain, Christian, pray for me to our God with much earnestness, fervency, and frequently, in all your knockings at our Father's door, because I do very much stand in need thereof; for my work is great, my heart is vile, the devil lieth at watch, the world would fain be saying, ""Aha, aha, thus we would have it""; and of myself, keep myself I cannot; trust myself I dare not; if God do not help me, I am sure it will not be long before my heart deceive me, and the world would have their advantage of me, and so God be dishonoured by me, and thou also ashamed to own me.","O, therefore, be much in prayer for me, thy fellow!","I trust, in that glorious grace that is conveyed from Heaven to sinners, by which they are not only sanctified here in this world, but shall be glorified in that which is to come; unto which, the Lord of His mercy bring us all.",John Bunyan.,"___________________ These are several titles which are set over the several TRUTHS contained in this book, for thy sooner finding of them-- THE FIRST PART 1.","The words of the text opened, and the doctrines laid down.","[This doctrine, that there are some that are under the law, or under the Covenant of Works.]",2.,"What the Covenant of Works is, and when it is given.",3.,What it is to be under the Covenant of Works.,4.

OR, A DISCOVERY OF THE LAW AND GRACE; THE NATURE OF THE ONE, AND THE NATURE OF THE OTHER, AS THEY ARE THE TWO COVENANTS, ETC.","""FOR YE ARE NOT UNDER THE LAW, BUT UNDER GRACE"" (Rom 6:14).","[THE WORDS OF THE TEXT OPENED, AND THE DOCTRINES LAID DOWN.]","In the three former chapters, the Apostle is pleading for the salvation of sinners by grace without the works of the law, to the end he might confirm the saints, and also that he might win over all those that did oppose the truth of this doctrine, or else leave them the more without excuse; and that he might so do, he taketh in hand, first, to show the state of all men naturally, or as they come into the world by generation, saying, in the Third Chapter, ""There is none righteous, no, not one; there is none that understandeth; there is none that doeth good,"" etc.","As if he had said, It seems there is a generation of men that think to be saved by the righteousness of the law; but let me tell them that they are much deceived, in that they have already sinned against the law; for by the disobedience of one, many, yea all, were brought into a state of condemnation (Rom 5:12-20).","Now, in the Sixth Chapter he doth, as if he had turned him round to the brethren, and said, My brethren, you see now that it is clear and evident that it is freely by the grace of Christ that we do inherit eternal life.","And again, for your comfort, my brethren, let me tell you that your condition is wondrous safe, in that you are under grace; for, saith he, ""Sin shall not have dominion over you""; that is, neither the damning power, neither the filthy power, so as to destroy your souls: ""For ye are not under the law""; that is, you are not under that that will damn you for sin; ""but"" you are ""under grace,"" or stand thus in relation to God, that though you have sinned, yet you shall be pardoned.","""For ye are not under the law, but under grace.""","If any should ask what is the meaning of the word ""under,"" I answer, it signifieth, you are not held, kept, or shut up by it so as to appear before God under that administration, and none but that; or thus, you are not now bound by the authority of the law to fulfill it and obey it, so as to have no salvation without you so do; or thus, if you transgress against any one tittle of it, you by the power of it must be condemned.","No, no, for you are not so under it; that is, not thus under the law.","Again, ""For ye are not under the law.""","What is meant by this word ""law""?","The word ""law,"" in Scripture, may be taken more ways than one, as might be largely cleared.","There is the law of faith, the law of sin, the law of men, the law of works, otherwise called the Covenant of Works, or the first or old covenant.","""In that He saith a new covenant,"" which is the grace of God, or commonly called the Covenant of Grace, ""He hath made the first old,"" that is, the Covenant of Works, or the law (Heb 8:13).","I say, therefore, the word ""law"" and the word ""grace,"" in this Sixth of the Romans, do hold forth the two covenants which all men are under; that is, either the one or the other.","""For ye are not under the law""--that is, you to whom I do now write these words, who are and have been effectually brought into the faith of Jesus, you are not under the law, or under the Covenant of Works.","He doth not, therefore, apply these words to all, but to some, when he saith, ""But ye""; mark, ye, ye believers, ye converted persons, ye saints, ye that have been born.","(YE) ""for ye are not under the law,"" implying others are that are in their natural state, that have not been brought in to the Covenant of Grace by faith in Jesus Christ.","The words, therefore, being thus understood, there is discovered these two truths in them--DOCTRINE FIRST.",That there are some in Gospel times that are under the Covenant of Works.,DOCTRINE SECOND.,"That there is never a believer under the law, as it is the Covenant of Works, but under grace through Christ.","""For ye,"" you believers, you converted persons, ye ""are not under the law but under grace""; or, for you are delivered and brought into or under the Covenant of Grace.",DOCTRINE FIRST.,"For the first, THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE UNDER THE LAW, OR UNDER THE COVENANT OF WORKS, see, I pray you, that Scripture in the Third of the Romans, where the Apostle, speaking before of sins against the law, and of the denunciations thereof against those that are in that condition, he saith, ""What things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law""; mark, ""it saith to them who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God"" (Rom 3:19).","That is, all those that are under the law as a Covenant of Works, that are yet in their sins, and unconverted, as I told you before.","Again he saith, ""But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law"" (Gal 5:18).","Implying again, that those which are for sinning against the law, or the works of the law, either as it is the old covenant, these are under the law, and not under the Covenant of Grace.","Again he saith, ""For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse"" (Gal 3:10).","That is, they that are under the law are under the curse; for mark, they that are under the Covenant of Grace are not under the curse.","Now, there are but two covenants, therefore, it must needs be that they that are under the curse are under the law, seeing those that are under the other covenant are not under the curse, but under the blessing.","""So, then, they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham,"" but the rest are under the law (Gal 3:9).",Now I shall proceed to what I do intend to speak unto.,FIRST.,"I shall show you what the Covenant of Works, or the law, is, and when it was first given, together with the nature of it.",SECOND.,"I shall show you what it is to be under the law, or Covenant of Works, and the miserable state of all those that are under it.",THIRD.,"I shall show you who they are that are under this covenant, or law.",FOURTH.,"I shall show you how far a man may go and yet be under this covenant, or law.","[WHAT THE COVENANT OF WORKS IS, AND WHEN IT WAS GIVEN.]",FIRST.,"What this Covenant of Works is, and when it was given.",[What this covenant is.],"The Covenant of Works or the law, here spoken of, is the law delivered upon Mount Sinai to Moses, in two tables of stone, in ten particular branches or heads; for this see Galatians 4.","The Apostle, speaking there of the law, and of some also that through delusions of false doctrine were brought again, as it were, under it, or at least were leaning that way (verse 21) he saith, As for you that desire to be under the law, I will show you the mystery of Abraham's two sons, which he had by Hagar and Sarah; these two do signify the two covenants; the one named Hagar signifies Mount Sinai, where the law was delivered to Moses on two tables of stone (Exo 24:12; 34:1; Deu 10:1).","Which is that, that whosoever is under, he is destitute of, and altogether without the grace of Christ in his heart at the present.","""For I testify again to every man,"" saith he, speaking to the same people, that ""Christ has become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law,"" namely, that given on Mount Sinai--""ye are fallen from grace"" (Gal 5:3,4).","That is, not that any can be justified by the law; but this meaning is, that all those that seek justification by the works of the law, they are not such as seek to be under the second covenant, the Covenant of Grace.","Also the Apostle, speaking again of these two covenants, saith, ""But if the ministration of death,"" or the law, for it is all one, ""written and engraven in stones,"" mark that, ""was glorious, how shall not the ministration of the Spirit,"" or the Covenant of Grace, ""be rather glorious?""","(2 Cor 3:7,8).","As if he had said, It is true, there was a glory in the Covenant of Works, and a very great excellency did appear in it--namely, in that given in the stones on Sinai--yet there is another covenant, the Covenant of Grace, that doth exceed it for comfort and glory.",[When it was given.],"But, though this law was delivered to Moses from the hands of angels in two tables of stones, on Mount Sinai, yet this was not the first appearing of this law to man; but even this in substance, though possibly not so openly, was given to the first man, Adam, in the Garden of Eden, in these words: ""And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die"" (Gen 2:16,17).","Which commandment then given to Adam did contain in it a forbidding to do any of those things that was and is accounted evil, although at that time it did not appear so plainly, in so many particular heads, as it did when it was again delivered on Mount Sinai; but yet the very same.","And that I shall prove thus-- God commanded Adam in Paradise to abstain from all evil against the first covenant, and not from some sins only; but if God had not commanded Adam to abstain from the sins spoken against in the Ten Commandments, He had not commanded to abstain from all, but from some; therefore it must needs be that He then commanded to abstain from all sins forbidden in the law given on Mount Sinai.","Now that God commanded to abstain from all evil or sin against any of the Ten Commandments, when He gave Adam the command in the garden, it is evident that He did punish the sins that were committed against those commands that were then delivered on Mount Sinai, before they were delivered on Mount Sinai, which will appear as followeth-- The First, Second, and Third Commandments were broken by Pharaoh and his men; for they had false gods which the Lord executed judgment against (Exo 12:12); and blasphemed their true God (Exo 5:2) which escaped not punishment (Exo 7:17-25).","For their gods could neither deliver themselves nor their people from the hand of God; but ""in the thing wherein they dealt proudly, He was above them"" (Exo 18:11).","Again; some judge that the Lord punished the sin against the Second Commandment, which Jacob was in some measure guilty of in not purging his house from false gods, with the defiling of his daughter Dinah (Gen 34:2).","Again; we find that Abimelech thought the sin against the Third Commandment so great, that he required no other security of Abraham against the fear of mischief that might be done to him by Abraham, his son, and his son's son, but only Abraham's oath (Gen 21:23).",The like we see between Abimelech and Isaac (Gen 31:53).,"The like we find in Moses and the Israelites, who durst not leave the bones of Joseph in Egypt, because of the oath of the Lord, whose name, by so doing, would have been abused (Exo 13:19).",And we find the Lord rebuking His people for the breach of the Fourth Commandment (Exo 16:27-29).,"And for the breach of the Fifth, the curse came upon Ham (Gen 9:25-27).","And Ishmael dishonouring his father in mocking Isaac was cast out, as we read (Gen 21:9,10).",The sons-in-law of Lot for slighting their father perish in the overthrow of Sodom (Gen 19:14).,"The Sixth Commandment was broken by Cain, and so dreadful a curse and punishment came upon him that it made him cry out, ""My punishment is greater than I can bear"" (Gen 4:13).","Again; when Esau threatened to slay his brother, Rebecca sent him away, saying, ""Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?""","hinting unto us, that she knew murder was to be punished with death (Gen 27:45) which the Lord Himself declared likewise to Noah (Gen 9:6).3 Again; a notable example of the Lord's justice in punishing murder we see in the Egyptians and Pharaoh, who drowned the Israelites' children in the river (Exo 1:22); and they themselves were drowned in the sea (Exo 14:27).","The sin against the Seventh Commandment was punished in the Sodomites, etc., with the utter destruction of their city and themselves (Gen 19:24,25).","Yea, they suffer ""the vengeance of eternal fire"" (Jude 7).","Also the male Shechemites, for the sin committed by Hamor's son, were all put to the sword (Gen 34:25,26).","Our first parents sinned against the Eighth Commandment in taking the forbidden fruit, and so brought the curse on themselves and their posterity (Gen 3:16).","Again; the punishment due to the breach of this Commandment was by Jacob accounted death (Gen 31:30,32).","And also by Jacob's sons (Gen 44:9,10).","Cain sinning against the Ninth Commandment as in Genesis 4:9, was therefore cursed as to the earth (Verse 11).","And Abraham, though the friend of God, was blamed for false-witness by Pharaoh, and sent out of Egypt (Gen 12:18-20) and both he and Sarah reproved by Abimelech (Gen 20:9,10,16).","Pharaoh sinned against the Tenth Commandment, and was therefore plagued with great plagues (Gen 12:15,17).","Abimelech coveted Abraham's wife, and the Lord threatened death to him and his, except he restored her again; yea, though he had not come near her, yet for coveting and taking her the Lord fast closed up the wombs of his house (Gen 20:3,18).",[Further Arguments.],"I could have spoken more fully to this, but that I would not be too tedious, but speak what I have to say with as much brevity as I can.","But before I pass it, I will besides this give you an argument or two more for the further clearing of this, that the substance of the law delivered on Mount Sinai was, before that, delivered by the Lord to man in the garden.","As, first, ""death reigned over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression""--that is, though they did not take the forbidden fruit as Adam did; but had the transgression been no other, or had their sin been laid to the charge of none but those that did eat of that fruit, then those that were born to Adam after he was shut out of the garden had not had sin, in that they did not actually eat of that fruit, and so had not been slaves to death; but, in that death did reign from Adam to Moses, of from the time of his transgression against the first giving of the law, till the time the law was given on Mount Sinai, it is evident that the substance of the Ten Commandments was given to Adam and his posterity under that command, ""Eat not of the tree that is in the midst of the garden.""","But yet, if any shall say that it was because of the sin of their father that death reigned over them, to that I shall answer, that although original sin be laid to the charge of his posterity, yet it is also for their sins that they actually committed that they were plagued.","And again, saith the Apostle, ""For where no law is, there is no transgression"" (Rom 4:15).","For ""sin is not imputed when there is no law; nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses.""","saith he (Rom 5:13,14).","But if there had been no law, then there had been no transgression, and so no death to follow after as the wages thereof; for death is the wages of sin (Rom 6:23) and sin is the breach of the law; an actual breach in our particular persons, as well as an actual breach in our public person (1 John 3:4).","4 Again; there are no other sins than those against that law given on Sinai, for the which those sins before mentioned were punished; therefore the law given before by the Lord to Adam and his posterity is the same with that afterwards given on Mount Sinai.","Again; the conditions of that on Sinai and of that in the garden are all one; the one saying, ""Do this and live,"" the other saying the same.",Also judgment denounced against men in both kinds alike; therefore this law it appeareth to be the very same that was given on Mount Sinai.,"Again; the Apostle speaketh but of two covenants--to wit, grace and works--under which two covenants all are; some under one, and some under the other.","Now this to Adam is one, therefore that on Sinai is one, and all one with this; and that this is a truth, I say, I know, because the sins against that on Sinai were punished by God for the breech thereof before it was given there; so it doth plainly appear to be a truth; for it would be unrighteous with God for to punish for that law that was not broken; therefore it was all one with that on Sinai.","Now the law given on Sinai was for the more clear discovery of those sins that were before committed against it; for though the very substance of the Ten Commandments were given in the garden before they were received from Sinai, yet they lay so darkly in the heart of man, that his sins were not so clearly discovered as afterwards they were; therefore, saith the Apostle, the law was added (Gal 3:19).","Or, more plainly, given on Sinai, on tables of stone, ""that the offence might abound,""--that is, that it might the more clearly be made manifest and appear (Rom 5:20).","Again; we have a notable resemblance of this at Sinai, even in giving the law; for, first, the law was given twice on Sinai, to signify that indeed the substance of it was given before.","And, secondly, the first tables that were given on Sinai were broken at the foot of the mount, and the others were preserved whole, to signify that though it was the true law that was given before, with that given on Sinai, yet it was not so easy to be read and to be taken notice of, in that the stones were not whole, but broken, and so the law written thereon somewhat defaced and disfigured.",[Object.],"But if any object and say, though the sins against the one be the sins against the other, and so in that they do agree, yet it doth not appear that the same is therefore the same Covenant of Works with the other.",Answ.,"That which was given to Adam in Paradise you will grant was the Covenant of Works; for it runs thus: Do this and live; do it not and die; nay, ""Thou shalt surely die.""",Now there is but one Covenant of Works.,"If therefore I prove that that which was delivered on Mount Sinai is the Covenant of Works, then all will be put out of doubt.",Now that this is so it is evident-- 1.,"Consider the two covenants are thus called in Scripture, the one the administration of death, and the other the administration of life; the one the Covenant of Works, the other of grace; but that delivered on Sinai is called the ministration of death; that, therefore, is the Covenant of Works.","""But if,"" saith he, ""the ministration of death, written and engraven on stones was glorious,"" (2 Cor 3:7).",2.,"The Apostle, writing to the Galatians, doth labour to beat them off from trusting in the Covenant of Works; but when he comes to give a discovery of that law or covenant--he labouring to take them off from trusting in it--he doth plainly tell them it is that which was given on Sinai (Gal 4:24,25).","Therefore that which was delivered in two tables of stone on Mount Sinai, is the very same thing that was given before to Adam in Paradise, they running both alike; that in the garden saying, Do this and live; but in the day thou eatest thereof--or dost not do this--thou shalt surely die.","And so is this on Sinai, as is evident when he saith, ""the man which doeth those things shall live by them"" (Rom 10:5).","And in case they break them, even any of them, it saith, ""Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the (whole) book of the law to do them"" (Gal 3:10).","Now this being thus cleared, I shall proceed.",[WHAT IT IS TO BE UNDER THE COVENANT OF WORKS.],SECOND.,"A second thing to be spoken to is this: to show what it is to be under the law as it is a Covenant of Works; to which I shall speak, and that thus-- To be under the law as it is a Covenant of Works, is to be bound, upon pain of eternal damnation, to fulfill, and that completely and continually, every particular point of the Ten Commandments, by doing them--Do this, and then thou shalt live; otherwise, ""cursed is every one that continueth not in all,"" in every particular thing or ""things which are written in the book for the law to do them"" (Gal 3:10).","That man that is under the first covenant stands thus, and only thus, as he is under that covenant, or law.","Poor souls, through ignorance of the nature of that Covenant of Works, the law that they are under, they do not think their state to be half so bad as it is; when, alas!","there is none in the world in such a sad condition again besides themselves; for, indeed, they do not understand these things.","He that is under the law, as it is a Covenant of Works, is like the man that is bound by the law of his king, upon pain of banishment, or of being hanged, drawn, and quartered, not to transgress any of the commandments of the king; so here, they that are under the Covenant of Works, they are bound, upon pain of eternal banishment and condemnation, to keep within the compass of the law of the God of Heaven.","The Covenant of Works may, in this case, be compared to the laws of the Medes and Persians, which being once made, cannot be altered.",Daniel 6:8.,"You find that when there was a law made and given forth that none should ask a petition of any, God or man, but of the king only; this law being established by the king (verse 9).","Daniel breaking of it, let all do whatever they can, Daniel must go into the lions' den (verse 16).","So here, I say, there being a law given, and sealed with the Truth and the Word of God,--how that ""the soul that sinneth, it shall die"" (Eze 18:4).","Whosoever doth abide under this covenant, and dieth under the same, they must and shall go into the lion's den; yea, worse than that, for they shall be thrown into Hell, to the very devils.","But to speak in a few particulars for thy better understanding herein, know, First.","That the Law of God, or Covenant of Works, doth not contain itself in one particular branch of the law, but doth extend itself into many, even into all the Ten Commandments, and those ten into very many more, as might be showed; so that the danger doth not lie in the breaking of one or two of these ten only, but it doth lie even in the transgression of any one of them.","As you know, if a king should give forth ten particular commands to be obeyed by his subjects upon pain of death; now if any man doth transgress against any one of these ten, he doth commit treason, as if he had broke them all, and lieth liable to have the sentence of the law as certainly passed on him as if he had broken every particular of them.",Second.,"Again; you know that the laws being given forth by the king, which if a man keep and obey for a long time, yet if at the last he slips and breaks those laws, he is presently apprehended, and condemned by that law.","These things are clear as touching the Law of God, as it is a Covenant of Works.","If a man doth fulfill nine of the Commandments, and yet breaketh but one, that being broken will as surely destroy him and shut him out from the joys of Heaven as if he had actually transgressed against them all; for indeed, in effect, so he hath.","There is a notable Scripture for this in the Epistle of James, Second Chapter, at the tenth verse, that runs thus:--""For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all,""--that is, he hath in effect broken them all, and shall have the voice of them all cry out against him.","And it must needs be so, saith James, because ""He that said,"" or that law which said, ""Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.","Now, if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law"" (Verse 11).","As thus; it may be thou didst never make to thyself a god of stone or wood, or at least not to worship them so greatly and so openly as the heathen do, yet if thou hast stolen, born false witness, or lusted after a woman in thy heart (Matt 5:28) thou hast transgressed the law, and must for certain, living and dying under that covenant, perish for ever by the law; for the law hath resolved on that before-hand, saying, ""Cursed is every one that continueth not in ALL things""; mark, I pray you, ""in all things""; that is the Word, and that seals the doctrine.",Third.,"Again; though a man doth not covet, steal, murder, worship gods of wood and stone, etc., yet if he do take the Lord's name in vain, he is for ever gone, living and dying under that covenant.","""Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain""; there is the command.",But how if we do?,"Then he saith, ""the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.""","No; though thou live as holy as ever thou canst, and walk as circumspectly as ever any did, yet if thou dost take the Lord's name in vain, thou art gone by that covenant: ""For I will not,"" mark ""I will not,"" let him be in never so much danger, ""I will not hold him guiltless that taketh My name in vain"" (Exo 20:7).","And so likewise for any other of the ten, do but break them, and thy state is irrecoverable, if thou live and die under that covenant.",Fourth.,"Though thou shouldest fulfill this covenant, or law, even all of it, for a long time, ten, twenty, forty, fifty, or threescore years, yet if thou do chance to slip and break one of them but once before thou die, thou art also gone and lost by that covenant; for mark, ""Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things,"" that continueth not in ALL things, mark that, ""which are written in the book of the law to do them.""","But if a man doth keep all the Law of God his whole lifetime, and only sin one time before he dies, that one sin is a breach of the law, and he hath not continued in doing the things contained therein.","For, so to continue, according to the sense of this Scripture, is to hold on without any failing, either in thought, word, or deed; therefore, I say, though a man doth walk up to the law all his lifetime, but only at the very last sin one time before he die, he is sure to perish for ever, dying under that covenant.","For, my friends, you must understand that the Law of God is ""yea,"" as well as the Gospel; and as they that are under the Covenant of Grace shall surely be saved by it, so, even so, they that are under the Covenant of Works and the law, they shall surely be damned by it, if continuing there.","This is the Covenant of Works and the nature of it--namely, not to abate anything, no, not a mite, to him that lives and dies under it: ""I tell thee,"" saith Christ, ""thou shalt not depart thence,"" that is, from under the curse, ""till thou hast paid the very last mite"" (Luke 12:59).",Fifth.,"Again; you must consider that this law doth not only condemn words and actions, as I said before, but it hath authority to condemn the most secret thoughts of the heart, being evil; so that if thou do not speak any word that is evil, as swearing, lying, jesting, dissembling, or any other word that tendeth to, or savoureth of sin, yet if there should chance to pass but one vain thought through thy heart but once in all thy lifetime, the law taketh hold of it, accuseth, and also will condemn thee for it.","You may see one instance for all in (Matt 5:27,28) where Christ saith, that though a man doth not lie with a woman carnally, yet if he doth but look on her, and in his heart lust after her, he is counted by the law, being rightly expounded, such an one that hath committed the sin, and thereby hath laid himself under the condemnation of the law.","And so likewise of all the rest of the commands; if there be any thought that is evil do but pass through thy heart, whether it be against God or against man in the least measure, though possibly not discerned of thee, or by thee, yet the law takes hold of thee therefore, and doth by its authority, both cast, condemn, and execute thee for thy so doing.","""The thought of foolishness is sin"" (Prov 24:9).",Sixth.,"Again; the law is of that nature and severity, that it doth not only inquire into the generality of thy life as touching several things, whether thou art upright there or no; but the law doth also follow thee into all thy holy duties, and watcheth over thee there, to see whether thou dost do all things aright there--that is to say, whether when thou dost pray thy heart hath no wandering thoughts in it; whether thou do every holy duty thou doest perfectly without the least mixture of sin; and if it do find thee to slip, or in the least measure to fail in any holy duty that thou dost perform, the law taketh hold on that, and findeth fault with that, so as to render all the holy duties that ever thou didst unavailable because of that.","I say, if, when thou art a hearing, there is but one vain thought, or in praying, but one vain thought, or in any other thing whatsoever, let it be civil or spiritual, one vain thought once in all thy lifetime will cause the law to take such hold on it, that for that one thing it doth even set open all the floodgates of God's wrath against thee, and irrecoverably by that covenant it doth bring eternal vengeance upon thee; so that, I say, look which ways thou wilt, and fail wherein thou wilt, and do it as seldom as ever thou canst, either in civil or spiritual things, as aforesaid--that is, either in the service of God, or in thy employments in the world, as thy trade or calling, either in buying or selling any way, in anything whatsoever; I say, if in any particular it find thee tardy, or in the least measure guilty, it calleth thee an offender, it accuseth thee to God, it puts a stop to all the promises thereof that are joined to the law, and leaves thee there as a cursed transgressor against God, and a destroyer of thy own soul.","5 Here I would have thee, by the way, for to take notice, that it is not my intent at this time to enlarge on the several commands in particular--for that would be very tedious both for me to write and thee to read; only thus much I would have thee to do at the reading hereof--make a pause, and sit still one quarter of an hour, and muse a little in thy mind thus with thyself, and say, Did I ever break the law; yea or no?","Had I ever, in all my lifetime, one sinful thought passed through my heart since I was born; yea or no?","And if thou findest thyself guilty, as I am sure thou canst not otherwise choose but do, unless thou shut thy eyes against thy every day's practice, then, I say, conclude thyself guilty of the breach of the first covenant.","And when that this is done, be sure, in the next place, thou do not straightway forget it and put it out of thy mind, that thou art condemned by the same covenant; and then do not content thyself until thou do find that God hath sent thee a pardon from Heaven through the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ, the mediator of the second covenant.","And if God shall but give thee a heart to take this my counsel, I do make no question but these words spoken by me, will prove an instrument for the directing of thy heart to the right remedy for the salvation of thy soul.","Thus much now touching the law, and the severity of it upon the person that is found under it, having offended or broken any particular of it, either in thought, word, or action; and now, before I do proceed to the next thing, I shall answer four objections that do lie in my way, and also, such as do stumble most part of the world.",[Four Objections.],Object.,First.,"But you will say, Methinks you speak very harsh; it is enough to daunt a body.","Set the case, therefore, that a man, after he hath sinned and broken the law, repenteth of his wickedness and promiseth to do so no more, will not God have mercy then, and save a poor sinner then?",Answ.,"I told you before, that the covenant, once broken, will execute upon the offender that which it doth threaten to lay upon him; and as for your supposing that your repenting and promising to do so no more may help well, and put you in a condition to attain the mercy of God by the law, these thoughts do flow from gross ignorance both of the nature of sin, and also of the nature of the justice of God.","And if I were to give you a description of one in a lost condition for the present, I would brand him out with such a mark of ignorance as this is.",Answ.,2.,[The first answer is expounded by the second].,"The law, as it is a Covenant of Works, doth not allow of any repentance unto life to those that live and die under it; for the law being once broken by thee, never speaks good unto thee, neither doth God at all regard thee, if thou be under that covenant, notwithstanding all thy repenting and also promises to do so no more.","No, saith the law, thou hast sinned, therefore I must curse thee; for it is My nature to curse, even, and nothing else but curse, every one that doth in any point transgress against Me (Gal 3:10).","They brake My covenant ""and I regarded them not, saith the Lord"" (Heb 8:9).","Let them cry, I will not regard them; let them repent, I will not regard them; they have broken My covenant, and done that in which I delighted not; therefore, by that covenant I do curse, and not bless; damn, and not save; frown, and not smile; reject, and not embrace; charge sin and not forgive it.","They brake My covenant ""and I regarded them not""; so that I say, if thou break the law, the first covenant, and thou being found there, God looking on thee through that, He hath no regard on thee, no pity for thee, no delight in thee.",Object.,Second.,But hath not the law promises as well as threatenings?,"saying, ""The man which doeth these things shall live,"" mark, he shall live, ""by them,"" or in them (Rom 10:5; Gal 3:12).",Answ.,1.,"To break the Commandments is not to keep or fulfill the same; but thou hast broken them, therefore the promise doth not belong to thee by that covenant.",2.,"The promises that are of the law are conditional, and so not performed unless there be a full and continual obedience to every particular of it, and that without the least sin.","""Do this""--mark, do this--and afterwards thou shalt live; but if thou break one point of it once in all thy life, thou hast not done the law; therefore the promises following the law do not belong unto thee if one sin hath been committed by thee.","As thus, I will give you a plain instance--""Set the case, there be a law made by the king, that if any man speak a word against him he must be put to death, and this must not be revoked, but must for certain be executed on the offender; though there be a promise made to them that do not speak a word against him, that they should have great love from him; yet this promise is nothing to the offender; he is like to have no share in it, or to be ever the better for it; but contrariwise, the law that he hath offended must be executed on him; for his sin shutteth him out from a share of, or in, the promises.""","So it is here, there is a promise made indeed, but to whom?","Why, it is to none but those that live without sinning against the law; but if thou, I say, sin one time against it in all thy lifetime, thou art gone, and not one promise belongs to thee if thou continue under this covenant.","Methinks the prisoners at the bar, having offended the law, and the charge of a just judge towards them, do much hold forth the law, as it is a Covenant of Works, and how it deals with them that are under it.","The prisoner having offended, cries out for mercy; Good, my lord, mercy, saith he, pray, my lord, pity me.","The judge saith, What canst thou say for thyself that sentence of death should not be passed upon thee?","Why, nothing but this, I pray my lord be merciful.","But he answers again, Friend, the law must take place, the law must not be broken.","The prisoner saith, Good, my lord, spare me, and I will never do so any more.","The judge, notwithstanding the man's outcries and sad condition, must, according to the tenor of the law, pass judgment upon him, and the sentence of condemnation must be read to the prisoner, though it makes him fall down dead to hear it, if he executes the law as he ought to do.",And just thus it is concerning the Law of God.,Object.,Third.,"Ay, but sometimes, for all your haste, the judge doth also give some pardons, and forgives some offenders, notwithstanding their offences, though he be a judge.",Answ.,"It is not because the law is merciful, but because there is manifested the love of the judge, not the love of the law.","I beseech you to mark this distinction; for if a man that hath deserved death by the law be, notwithstanding this, forgiven his offence, it is not because the law saith, ""spare him""; but it is the love of the judge or chief magistrate that doth set the man free from the condemnation of the law.","But mark; here the law of men and the Law of God do differ; the law of man is not so irrevocable; but if the Supreme please he may sometimes grant a pardon without satisfaction given for the offence; but the Law of God is of this nature, that if a man be found under it, and a transgressor, or one that hath transgressed against it, before that prisoner can be released there must be a full and complete satisfaction given to it, either by the man's own life or by the blood of some other man; for ""without shedding of blood is no remission"" (Heb 9:22); that is, there is no deliverance from under the curse of the Law of God; and therefore, however the law of man may be made of none effect sometimes by showing mercy without giving of a full satisfaction, yet the Law of God cannot be so contented, nor at the least give way, that the person offending that should escape the curse and not be damned, except some one do give a full and complete satisfaction to it for him, and bring the prisoner into another covenant--to wit, the Covenant of Grace, which is more easy, and soul-refreshing, and sin-pardoning.","I say, therefore, you must understand that if there be a law made that reaches the life, to take it away for the offence given by the offender against it, then it is clear that if the man be spared and saved, it is not the law that doth give the man this advantage, but it is the mere mercy of the king, either because he hath a ransom or satisfaction some other way, or being provoked thereto out of his own love to the person whom he saveth.","Now, thou also having transgressed and broken the Law of God, if the law be not executed upon thee, it is not because the law is merciful, or can pass by the least offence done by thee, but thy deliverance comes another way; therefore, I say, however it be by the laws of men where they be corrupted and perverted, yet the Law of God is of that nature, that if it hath not thy own blood or the blood of some other man--for it calls for no less, for to ransom thee from the curse of it, being due to thee for thy transgression, and to satisfy the cries, the doleful cries, thereof, and ever for to present thee pure and spotless before God, notwithstanding this fiery law--thou art gone if thou hadst a thousand souls; for ""without shedding of blood there is no remission"" (Heb 9:22); no forgiveness of the least sin against the law.",Object.,Fourth.,"But, you will say, ""I do not only repent me of my former life, and also promise to do so no more, but now I do labour to be righteous, and to live a holy life; and now, instead of being a breaker of the law, I do labour to fulfill the same.","What say you to that?""",Answ.,"Set the case, thou couldst walk like an angel of God; set the case, thou couldst fulfill the whole law, and live from this day to thy life's end without sinning in thought, word, or deed, which is impossible; but, I say, set the case it should be so, why, thy state is as bad, if thou be under the first covenant, as ever it was.","For, first, I know thou darest not say but thou hast at one time or other sinned; and if so, then the law hath condemned thee; and if so, then I am sure that thou, with all thy actions and works of righteousness, canst not remove the dreadful and irresistible curse that is already laid upon thee by that law which thou art under, and which thou hast sinned against; though thou livest the holiest life that any man can live in this world, being under the law of works, and so not under the Covenant of Grace, thou must be cut off without remedy; for thou hast sinned, though afterwards thou live never so well.","The reasons for this that hath been spoken are these-- First, The nature of God's justice calls for it--that is, it calls for irrecoverable ruin on them that transgress against this law; for justice gave it, and justice looks to have it completely and continually obeyed, or else justice is resolved to take place, and execute its office, which is to punish the transgressor against it.","You must understand that the justice of God is as unchangeable as His love; His justice cannot change its nature; justice it is, if it be pleased; and justice it is, if it be displeased.","The justice of God in this case may be compared to fire; there is a great fire made in some place; if thou do keep out of it, it is fire; if thou do fall into it, thou wilt find it fire; and therefore the Apostle useth this as an argument to stir up the Hebrews to stick close to Jesus Christ, lest they fall under the justice of God by these words, ""For our God is a consuming fire"" (Heb 12:29); into which, if thou fall, it is not for thee to get out again, as it is with some that fall into a material fire; no, but he that falls into this, he must lie there for ever; as it is clear where he saith, ""Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings, and with devouring fire?""",(Isa 33:14).,"For justice once offended knoweth not how to show any pity or compassion to the offender, but runs on him like a lion, takes him by the throat, throws him into prison, and there he is sure to lie, and that to all eternity, unless infinite satisfaction be given to it, which is impossible to be given by any of us the sons of Adam.","Secondly, The faithfulness of God calls for irrecoverable ruin to be poured out on those that shall live and die under this covenant.","If thou, having sinned but one sin against this covenant, and shouldst afterwards escape damning, God must be unfaithful to Himself and to His Word, which both agree as one.","First, he would be unfaithful to Himself; to Himself, that is, to His justice, holiness, righteousness, wisdom, and power, if He should offer to stop the running out of His justice for the damning of them that have offended it.","And secondly, He would be unfaithful to His Word, His written Word, and disown, deny, and break that, of which He hath said, ""It is easier for Heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail,"" or be made of none effect (Luke 16:17).","Now, if He should not, according to His certain declarations therein, take vengeance on those that fall and die within the threat and sad curses denounced, in that His Word could not be fulfilled.","Thirdly, Because otherwise he would disown the sayings of His Prophets, and gratify the sayings of His enemies; His Prophets say He will take vengeance; His enemies say He will not; His Prophets say He will remember their iniquities, and recompense them into their bosom; but His enemies say they should do well, and they shall have peace, though they walk after the imaginations of their own hearts, and be not so strict as the Word commands, and do not as it saith (Deu 29:19,20).","But let me tell thee, hadst thou a thousand souls, and each of them was worth a thousand worlds, God would set them all on a light by fire, if they fall within the condemnings of His Word, and thou die without a Jesus, even the right Jesus; ""for the Scriptures cannot be broken.""",What!,"dost thou think that God, Christ, Prophets, and Scriptures, will all lie for thee?",and falsify their words for thee?,It will be but ill venturing thy soul upon that.,"And the reasons for it are these:--First, Because God is God; and secondly, Because man is man.","First, Because God is perfectly just and eternally just, perfectly holy and eternally holy, perfectly faithful and eternally faithful; that is, without any variableness or shadow of turning, but perfectly continueth the same, and cannot as well cease to be God as to alter or change the nature of His Godhead.","As He is thus the perfection of all perfections, He gave out His Law to be obeyed; but if any offend it, then they fall into the hands of this His eternal justice, and so must drink of His irrevocable wrath, which is the execution of the same justice.","I say, this being thus, the law being broken, justice takes place, and so faithfulness followeth to see that execution be done, and also to testify that He is true, and doth denounce His unspeakable, insupportable, and unchangeable vengeance on the party offending.","Secondly, Because thou art not as infinite as God, but a poor created weed, that is here today and gone tomorrow, and not able to answer God in His essence, being, and attributes; thou art bound to fall under Him, for thy soul or body can do nothing that is infinite in such a way as to satisfy this God, which is an infinite God in all His attributes.",[Misery of man by this law.],"But to declare unto you the misery of man by this law to purpose, I do beseech you to take notice of these following particulars, besides what has been already spoken:--First, I shall show the danger of them by reason of the law, as they come from Adam; Second, as they are in their own persons particularly under it.","[First, The danger of them by reason of the law, as they come from Adam.]",1.,"As they come from Adam, they are in a sad condition, because he left them a broken covenant.","Or take it thus: because they, while they were in him, did with him break that covenant.",O!,"this was the treasure that Adam left to his posterity; it was a broken covenant, insomuch that death reigned over all his children, and doth still to this day, as they come from him, both natural and eternal death (Rom 5).","It may be, drunkard, swearer, liar, thief, thou dost not think of this.",2.,"He did not only leave them a broken covenant, but also made them himself sinners against it.","He [Adam] made them sinners--""By one man's disobedience many were made sinners"" (Rom 5:19).",And this is worse than the first.,3.,"Not only so, but he did deprive them of their strength, by which at first they were enabled to stand, and left them no more than dead men.",O helpless state!,O how beggarly and miserable are the sons of Adam!,4.,"Not only so, but also before he left them he was the conduit pipe through which the devil did convey off his poisoned spawn and venom nature into the hearts of Adam's sons and daughters, by which they are at this day so strongly and so violently carried away, that they fly as fast to Hell, and the devil, by reason of sin, as chaff before a mighty wind.",5.,"In a word, Adam led them out of their paradise, that is one more; and put out their eyes, that is another; and left them to the leading of the devil.",O sad!,"Canst thou hear this, and not have thy ears to tingle and burn on thy head?","Canst thou read this, and not feel thy conscience begin to throb and dag?","If so, surely it is because thou art either possessed with the devil, or besides thyself.",[Second.],"But I pass this, and come to the second thing, which is, the cause of their being in a sad condition, which is by reason of their being in their particular persons under it.",1.,"Therefore, they that are under the law, they are in a sad condition, because they are under that which is more ready, through our infirmity, to curse than to bless; they are under that called the ministration of condemnation, that is, they are under that dispensation, or administration, whose proper work is to curse and condemn, and nothing else (2 Cor 3).",2.,"Their condition is sad who are under the law, because they are not only under that ministration that doth condemn, but also that which doth wait an opportunity to condemn; the law doth not wait that it might be gracious, but it doth wait to curse and condemn; it came on purpose to discover sin, ""The law entered,"" saith the Apostle, ""that the offence might abound"" (Rom 5:20) or appear indeed to be that which God doth hate, and also to curse for that which hath been committed; as he saith, ""Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them"" (Gal 3:10).",3.,"They are in a sad condition, because that administration they are under that are under the law doth always find fault with the sinner's obedience as well as his disobedience, if it be not done in a right spirit, which they that are under that covenant cannot do, by reason of their being destitute of faith; therefore, I say, it doth control them, saying, ""This was not well done, this was done by the halves, this was not done freely, and that was not done perfectly, and out of love to God.""","And hence it is that some men, notwithstanding they labour to live as holy as ever they can according to the law, yet they do not live a peaceable life, but are full of condemnings, full of guilt and torment of conscience, finding themselves to fail here, and to fall short there, omitting this good which the law commands, and doing that evil which the law forbids, but never giveth them one good word for all their pains.",4.,"They that are under the law are in a sad condition, because they are under that administration that will never be contented with what is done by the sinner.","If thou be under this covenant, work as hard as thou canst, the law will never say, ""Well done""; never say, ""My good servant""; no; but always it will be driving thee faster, hastening of thee harder, giving thee fresh commands, which thou must do, and upon pain of damnation not to be left undone.","Nay, it is such a master that will curse thee, not only for thy sins, but also because thy good works were not so well done as they ought to be.",5.,"They that are under this covenant or law, their state is very sad, because this law doth command impossible things of him that is under it; and yet doth but right in it, seeing man at the first had in Adam strength to stand, if he would have used it, and the law was given them, as I said before, when man was in his full strength; and therefore no inequality if it commands the same still, seeing God that gave thee strength did not take it away.",I will give you a similitude for the clearing of it.,"Set the case that I give to my servant ten pounds, with this charge, Lay it out for my best advantage, that I may have my own again with profit; now if my servant, contrary to my command, goeth and spends my money in a disobedient way, is it any inequality in me to demand of my servant what I gave him at first?","Nay, and though he have nothing to pay, I may lawfully cast him into prison, and keep him there until I have satisfaction.","So here; the law was delivered to man at the first when he was in a possibility to have fulfilled it; now, then, though man have lost his strength, yet God is just in commanding the same work to be done.","Ay, and if they do not do the same things, I say, that are impossible for them to do, it is just with God to damn them, seeing it was they themselves that brought themselves into this condition; therefore, saith the Apostle, ""What things soever the law (or commands) saith, it saith to them who are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God"" (Rom 3:19).",And this is thy sad condition that art under the law (Gal 3:10).,"But if any should object, and say, But the law doth not command impossible things of natural man,-- I should answer in this case as the Apostle did in another very much like unto it, saying, ""Understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.""","For doth not the law command thee to love the Lord thy God with all thy soul, with all they strength, with all thy might, etc., and can the natural man do this?","How can those that are accustomed to do evil, do that which is commanded in this particular?","""Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?""",(Jer 12:23).,"Doth the law command thee to do good, and nothing but good, and that with all thy soul, heart, and delight?","which the law as a Covenant of Works calleth for;

I say, though they follow it, it will not lead them to Heaven; no, but contrariwise, it will lead them under the curse.","It is not possible, saith Paul, that any should be justified by the law, or by our following of it; for by that ""is the knowledge of sin,"" and by it we are condemned for the same, which is far from leading us to life, being the ministration of death (2 Cor 3).","And again; ""Israel, which followeth after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.",Wherefore?,"Because they sought it not by faith, but by the law, and by the works thereof"" (Rom 9:30-32).",7.,"They that are under the law are in a sad condition, because they do not know whether ever they shall have any wages for their work or no; they have no assurance of the pardon of their sins, neither any hopes of eternal life; but poor hearts as they are, they work for they do not know what, even like a poor horse that works hard all day, and at night hath a dirty stable for his pains; so thou mayest work hard all the days of thy life, and at the day of death, instead of having a glorious rest in the Kingdom of Heaven, thou mayest, nay, thou shalt, have for thy sins the damnation of thy soul and body in Hell to all eternity; forasmuch, as I said before, that the law, if thou sinnest, it doth not take notice of any good work done by thee, but takes its advantage to destroy and cut off thy soul for the sin thou hast committed.",8.,"They that are under the law are in a sad condition, because they are under that administration; upon whose souls God doth not smile, they dying there; for the administration that God doth smile upon His children through, is the Covenant of Grace, they being in Jesus Christ, the Lord of life and consolation; but contrariwise to those that are under the law; for they have His frowns, His rebukes, His threatenings, and with much severity they must be dealt withal--""For they continued not in My covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord"" (Heb 8:9).",9.,"They are in a sad condition, because they are out of the faith of Christ; they that are under the law have not the faith of Christ in them; for that dispensation which they are under is not the administration of faith.","The law is not of faith, saith the Apostle (Gal 3:12).",10.,"Because they have not received the Spirit; for that is received by the hearing of faith, and not by the law, nor the works thereof (Gal 3:2).",11.,"In a word, if thou live and die under that covenant, Jesus Christ will neither pray for thee, neither let thee have one drop of His blood to wash away thy sins, neither shalt thou be so much as one of the least in the Kingdom of Heaven; for all these privileges come to souls under another covenant, as the Apostle saith--""For such are not under the law, but under grace""--that is, such as have a share in the benefits of Jesus Christ, or such as are brought from under the first covenant into the second; or from under the law into the grace of Christ's Gospel, without which Covenant of Grace, and being found in that, there is no soul can have the least hope of eternal life, no joy in the Holy Ghost, no share in the privileges of saints, because they are tied up from them by the limits and bonds of the Covenant of Works.","For you must understand that these two covenants have their several bounds and limitations, for the ruling and keeping in subjection, or giving of freedom, to the parties under the said covenants.","Now they that are under the law are within the compass and the jurisdiction of that, and are bound to be in subjection to that; and living and dying under that, they must stand and fall to that, as Paul saith, ""To his own master he standeth or falleth.""","The Covenant of Grace doth admit to those that are under it also liberty and freedom, together with commanding of subjection to the things contained in it, which I shall speak to further hereafter.",[For what purpose the Law was added and given.],"But now, that the former things may be further made to appear--that is, what the sad condition of all them that are under the law is, as I have shown you something of the nature of the law, so also shall I show that the law was added and given for this purpose, that it might be so with those that are out of the Covenant of Grace.","First, God did give the law that sin might abound, not that it should take away sin in any, but to discover the sin which is already begotten, or that may be hereafter begotten, by lust and Satan (Rom 5:20).","I say, this is one proper work of the law, to make manifest sin; it is sent to find fault with the sinner, and it doth also watch that it may do so, and it doth take all advantages for the accomplishing of its work in them that give ear thereto, or do not give ear, if it have the rule over them.","I say, it is like a man that is sent by his lord to see and pry into the labours and works of other men, taking every advantage to discover their infirmities and failings, and to chide them?","yea, to throw them out of the Lord's favour for the same.",Second.,"Another great end why the Lord did add or give the law, it was that no man might have anything to lay to the charge of the Lord for His condemning of them that do transgress against the same.","You know that if a man should be had before an officer or judge, and there be condemned, and yet by no law, he that condemns him might be very well reprehended or reproved for passing the judgment; yea, the party himself might have better ground to plead for his liberty than the other to plead for the condemning of him; but this shall not be so in the judgment-day, but contrariwise; for then every man shall be forced to lay his hand on his mouth, and hold his tongue at the judgment of God when it is passed upon them; therefore saith the Apostle, ""What things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law""; that is, all the commands, all the cursings and threatenings that are spoken by it, are spoken, saith he, ""that every mouth may be stopped""; mark, I beseech you, ""it saith,"" saith he, ""that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God"" (Rom 3:19).","So that now, in case any in the judgment-day should object against the judgment of God, as those in the 25th of Matthew do, saying, Lord, when saw we Thee thus and thus?",and why dost Thou pass such a sad sentence of condemnation upon us?,"surely this is injustice, and not equity: now for the preventing of this the law was given; ay, and that it might prevent thee to purpose, God gave it betimes, before either thy first father had sinned, or thou wast born.","So that again, if there should be these objections offered against the proceedings of the Lord in justice and judgment, saying, Lord, why am I thus condemned, I did not know it was sin?","Now against these two was the law given and that betimes, so that both these are answered.","If the first come in and say, Why am I judged?",why am I damned?,"then will the law come in, even all the Ten Commandments, with every one of their cries against thy soul; the First saying, He hath sinned against Me, damn him; the Second saying also, He hath transgressed against Me, damn him; the Third also saying the same, together with the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth; even all of them will discharge themselves against thy soul if thou die under the first covenant, saying, He or they have transgressed against us, damn them, damn them: and I tell thee also, that these ten great guns, the Ten Commandments, will, with discharging themselves in justice against thy soul, so rattle in thy conscience, that thou wilt in spite of thy teeth be immediately put to silence, and have thy mouth stopped.","And let me tell thee further, that if thou shalt appear before God to have the Ten Commandments discharge themselves against thee, thou hadst better be tied to a tree, and have ten, yea, ten thousand of the biggest pieces of ordnance in the world to be shot off against thee; for these could go no further but only to kill the body; but they, both body and soul, to be tormented in Hell with the devil to all eternity.","Third, Again; if the second thing should be objected, saying, But Lord, I did not think this had been sin, or the other had been sin, for nobody told me so; then also will the giving of the law take off that, saying, Nay, But I was given to thy father Adam before he had sinned, or before thou wast born, and have ever since been in thy soul to convince thee of thy sins, and to control thee for doing the thing that was not right.","Did not I secretly tell thee at such a time, in such a place, when thou wast doing of such a thing, with such an one, or when thou was all alone, that this was a sin, and that God did forbid it, therefore if thou didst commit it, God would be displeased with thee for it: and when thou was thinking to do such a thing at such a time, did not I say, Forbear, do not so?","God will smite thee, and punish thee for it if thou dost do it.","And besides, God did so order it that you had me in your houses, in your Bibles, and also you could speak and talk of me; thus pleading the truth, thou shalt be forced to confess it is so; nay, it shall be so in some sort with the very Gentiles and barbarous people that fall far short of that light we have in these parts of the world; for, saith the Apostle, ""The Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law,"" that is, not written as we have, yet they ""are a law unto themselves: which show the works of the law written in their hearts"" (Rom 2:14,15).","That is, they have the law of works in them by nature, and therefore they shall be left without excuse; for their own consciences shall stand up for the truth of this where he saith, ""Their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another.""","Ay, but when?","Why, ""in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my Gospel"" (Rom 2:15,16).","So this, I say, is another end for which the Lord did give the law--namely, that God might pass a sentence in righteousness, without being charged with any injustice by those that shall fall under it in the judgment.","Fourth, A fourth end why the Lord did give the law it was, because they that die out of Jesus Christ might not only have their mouths stopped, but also that their persons ""might become guilty before God"" (Rom 3:19).","And indeed this will be the ground of silencing, as I said before, they finding themselves guilty, their consciences backing the truth of the judgment of God passed upon them, ""they shall become guilty""--that is, they shall be fit vessels for the wrath of God to be poured out into, being filled with guilt by reason of transgressions against the commandments; thus, therefore, shall the parties under the first covenant be ""fitted to destruction"" (Rom 9:22) even as wood or straw, being well dried, is fitted for the fire; and the law was added and given, and speaks to this very end, that sins might be shown, mouths might be stopped from quarreling, and that ""all the world,"" mark, ""the world may become guilty before God,"" and so be in justice for ever and ever overthrown because of their sins.",And this will be so for these reasons-- 1.,"Because God hath a time to magnify His justice and holiness, as well as to show His forbearance and mercy.","We read in Scripture that His eyes are too pure to behold iniquity, and then we shall find it true (Hab 1:13).","We read in Scripture that He will magnify the law, and make it honourable, and then He will do it indeed.","Now, because the Lord doth not strike so soon as He is provoked by sin, therefore poor souls will not know nor regard the justice of God, neither do they consider the time in which it must be advanced, which will be when men drop under the wrath of God as fast as hail in a mighty storm (2 Peter 3:9; Psa 50:21,22).","Now, therefore, look to it all you that count the long-suffering and forbearance of God slackness; and because for the present He keepeth silence, therefore to think that He is like unto yourselves.","No, no; but know that God hath His set time for every purpose of His, and in its time it shall be advanced most marvelously, to the everlasting astonishment and overthrow of that soul that shall be dealt withal by justice and the law.",O!,how will God advance His justice!,O!,how will God advance His holiness!,"First, by showing men that He in justice cannot, will not regard them, because they have sinned; and, secondly, in that His holiness will not give way for such unclean wretches to abide in His sight, His eyes are so pure.",2.,Because God will make it appear that He will be as good as His Word to sinners.,"Sinners must not look to escape always, though they may escape awhile, yet they shall not go far all adoe unpunished; no, but they shall have their due to a farthing, when every threatening and curse shall be accomplished and fulfilled on the head of the transgressor.","Friend, there is never an idle word that thou speakest but God will account with thee for it; there is never a lie thou tellest, but God will reckon with thee for it; nay, there shall not pass so much as one passage in all thy lifetime but God, the righteous God, will have it in the trial by His law, if thou die under it, in the judgment-day.",[WHO THE ARE THAT ARE UNDER THE COVENANT OF WORKS.],THIRD.,"But you will say--""But who are those that are thus under the law?""",Answ.,"Those that are under the law may be branched out into three ranks of men; either, first, such as are grossly profane, or such as are more refined; which may be two ways, some in a lower sort, and some in a more eminent way.","First, Then they are under the law as a Covenant of Works who are open profane, and ungodly wretches, such as delight not only in sin, but also make their boast of the same, and brag at the thoughts of committing of it.","Now, as for such as these are, there is a Scripture in the First Epistle of Paul to Timothy Chapter 1, verses 9, 10, which is a notable one to this purpose, ""The law,"" saith he, ""is not made for a righteous man,"" not as it is a Covenant of Works, ""but for the"" unrighteous or ""lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars,"" look to it, liars, ""for perjured persons, and,"" in a word, ""if there be any other thing that is not according to sound doctrine.""","These are one sort of people that are under the law, and so under the curse of the same, whose due is to drink up the brimful cup of God's eternal vengeance, and therefore I beseech you not to deceive yourselves; for ""know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?","Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God"" (1 Cor 6:9,10).","Poor souls, you think that you may have your sins, your lusts, and pleasures, and yet you shall do pretty well, and be let to go free in the judgment-day; but see what God saith of such in Deuteronomy 29:19, 20--which shall ""bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace,"" I shall be saved, I shall do as well as others, in the day when God shall judge the world by Jesus Christ; but, saith God, I will not spare them, no, but My anger and My jealousy shall smoke against them.",How far?,Even to the executing all the curses that are written in the Law of God upon them.,"Nay, saith God, I will be even with them, ""for I will blot out their names from under Heaven.""","And indeed it must of necessity be so, because such souls are unbelievers, in their sins, and under the law, which cannot, will not, show any mercy on them; for it is not the administration of mercy and life, but the administration of death and destruction, as you have it (2 Cor 3:7,9); and all those, every one of them, that are open profane, and scandalous wretches are under it, and have been so ever since they came into the world to this day; and they will for certain live and die under the same dispensation, and then be damned to all eternity, if they be not converted from under that covenant into and under the Covenant of Grace, of which I shall speak in its place; and yet for all this, how brag and crank 6 are our poor wantons and wicked ones in this day of forbearance!","as if God would never have a reckoning with them, as if there was no law to condemn them, as if there was no hellfire to put them into.","But O how will they be deceived when they shall see Christ sitting upon the judgment-seat, having laid aside his priestly and prophetical office, and appearing only as a judge to the wicked?","when they shall see all the records of Heaven unfolded and laid open; when they shall see each man his name in the Book of Life, and in the book of the law; when they shall see God in His majesty, Christ in His majesty, the saints in their dignity, but themselves in their impurity.",What will they say then?,whither will they fly then?,where will they leave their glory?,O sad state!,(Isa 10:3).,Second.,"They are under the law also who do not only so break and disobey the law, but follow after the law as hard as ever they can, seeking justification thereby--that is, though a man should abstain from the sins against the law, and labour to fulfill the law, and give up himself to the law, yet if he look no further than the law he is still under the law, and for all his obedience to the law, the righteous Law of God, he shall be destroyed by that law.","Friend, you must not understand that none but profane persons are under the law; no, but you must understand that a man may be turned from a vain, loose, open, profane conversation and sinning against the law, to a holy, righteous, religious life, and yet be in the same state, under the same law, and as sure to be damned as the other that are more profane and loose.","And though you may say this is very strange, yet I shall both say it and prove it to be true.","Read with understanding that Scripture in Romans 9:30-31, where the Apostle, speaking of the very thing, saith, ""But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness""; mark, that followed after the law of righteousness; they notwithstanding their earnest pursuit, or hunting after the law of righteousness, ""hath not attained to the law of righteousness.""","It signifies thus much to us, that let a man be never so earnest, so fervent, so restless, so serious, so ready, so apt and willing to follow the law and the righteousness thereof, if he be under that covenant, he is gone, he is lost, he is deprived of eternal life, because he is not under the ministration of life if he die there.","Read also that Scripture, Galatians 3:10, which saith, ""For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse""; mark, they that are of the works of the law.","Now, for to be of the works of the law, it is to be of the works of the righteousness thereof--that is, to abstain from sins against the law, and to do the commands thereof as near as ever they can for their lives, or with all the might they have: and therefore I beseech you to consider it, for men's being ignorant of this is the cause why so many go on supposing they have a share in Christ, because they are reformed, and abstain from the sins against the law, who, when all comes to all, will be damned notwithstanding, because they are not brought out from under the Covenant of Works, and put under the Covenant of Grace.",Object.,"""But can you in very deed make these things manifestly evident from the Word of God?","Methinks to reason thus is very strange, that a man should labour to walk up according to the Law of God as much as ever he can, and yet that man notwithstanding this, should be still under the curse.","Pray clear it.""",Answ.,"Truly this doth seem very strange, I do know full well, to the natural man, to him that is yet in his unbelief, because he goeth by beguiled reason; but for my part, I do know it is so, and shall labour also to convince thee of the truth of the same.",1.,"Then, the law is thus strict and severe, that if a man do sin but once against it, he, I say, is gone for ever by the law, living and dying under that covenant.","If you would be satisfied as touching the truth of this, do but read Galatians 3:10, where it saith ""Cursed is every one,"" that is, not a man shall miss by that covenant, ""that continueth not in all,"" mark, in all ""things which are written in the book of the law to do them.""",(1.),"Pray mark, here is a curse, in the first place, if all things written in the book of the law be not done, and that, continually too--that is, without any failing or one slip, as I said before.","Now there is never a one in the world but before they did begin to yield obedience to the least command, they in their own persons did sin against it by breaking of it.","The Apostle, methinks, is very notable for the clearing of this in Romans 3:5.","In the one he endeavours for to prove that all had transgressed in the first Adam as he stood a common person, representing both himself and us in his standing and falling.","""Wherefore,"" saith he, ""as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men,"" mark that; but why?","""for that all have sinned"" (Rom 5:12).","That is, forasmuch as all naturally are guilty of original sin, the sin that was committed by us in Adam; so this is one cause why none can be justified by their obedience to the law, because they have in the first place broken it in their first parents.","But, (2.)","in case this should be opposed and rejected by quarrelsome persons, though there be no ground for it, Paul hath another argument to back his doctrine, saying, For we have proved (already) that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin.","""As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.""","""They are all gone out of the way, they are together,"" mark, together, ""become unprofitable, there is none that doeth good, no, not one.""","""Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit, the poison of asps is under their lips.""","Their ""mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.""","""Their feet are swift to shed blood.""","In a word, ""Destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace have they not known.""","Now then, saith he, having proved these things so clearly, the conclusion of the whole is this, ""That what things soever the law saith,"" in both showing of sin, and cursing for the same, ""it saith"" all ""to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God"" (Rom 3:10,19).","So that here, I say, lieth the ground of our not being justified by the law, even because, in the first place, we have sinned against it; for know this for certain, that if the law doth take the least advantage of thee by thy sinning against it, all that ever thou shalt afterwards hear from it is nothing but Curse, curse, curse him, ""for not continuing in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.""",2.,"Thou canst not be saved by the righteous Law of God, the first covenant, because that, together with this thy miserable state, by original and actual sins, before thou didst follow the law, since thy turning to the law thou hast committed several sins against the law--""In many things we offend all.""","So that now thy righteousness to the law being mixed with sometimes the lust of concupiscence, fornication, covetousness, pride, heart-risings against God, coldness of affection towards Him, backwardness to good duties, speaking idle words, having of strife in your hearts, and such like; I say, these things being thus, the righteousness of the law is become too weak through this our flesh (Rom 8:3), and so, notwithstanding all our obedience to the law, we are yet through our weakness under the curse of the law; for, as I said before, the law is so holy, so just, and so good, that it cannot allow that any failing or slip should be done by them that look for life by the same.","""Cursed is every one that continuteth not in everything"" (Gal 3:10).","And this Paul knew full well, which made him throw away all his righteousness.","But you will say, that was his own.",Answ.,"But it was even that which while he calls it his own, he also calls it the righteousness of the law (Phil 3:7-10) and to account it but dung, but as dirt on his shoes, and that, that he might be found in Christ, and so be saved by Him ""without the deeds of the law"" (Rom 3:28).","But, 3.","Set the case, the righteousness of the law which thou hast was pure and perfect, without the least flaw or fault, without the least mixture of the least sinful thought, yet this would fall far short of presenting of thee blameless in the sight of God.",And that I prove by these arguments--(1.),"The first argument is, that that which is not Christ cannot redeem souls from the curse, it cannot completely present them before the Lord; now the law is not Christ; therefore the moral law cannot, by all our obedience to it, deliver us from the curse that is due to us (Acts 4:12).",(2.),"The second argument is, that that righteousness that is not the righteousness of faith, that is, by believing in Jesus Christ, cannot please God; now the righteousness of the law as a Covenant of Works is not the righteousness of faith; therefore the righteousness of the law as acted by us, being under that covenant, cannot please God.","The first is proved in Hebrews 11:6, ""But without faith it is impossible to please Him""; mark, it is impossible.","The second thus, ""The law is not of faith"" (Gal 3:12; Rom 10:5,6), compared with Galatians 3:11.","""But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident; for, The just shall live by faith.","And the law is not of faith.""","But for the better understanding of those that are weak of apprehension, I shall prove it thus--1.","The soul that hath eternal life, he must have it by right of purchase or redemption (Heb 9:12; Eph 1:7).",2.,This purchase of redemption must be through the blood of Christ.,"""We have redemption through His blood.""","""Without shedding of blood is no remission.""","Now the law is not in a capacity to die, and so to redeem sinners by the purchase of blood, which satisfaction justice calls for.",Read the same Scriptures (Heb 9:22).,"Justice calls for satisfaction, because thou hast transgressed and sinned against it, and that must have satisfaction; therefore all that ever thou canst do cannot bring in redemption, though thou follow the law up the to the nail-head, as I may say, because all this is not shedding of blood; for believe it, and know it for certain, that though thou hadst sinned but one sin before thou didst turn to the law, that one sin will murder thy soul, if it be not washed away by blood, even by the precious blood of Jesus Christ, that was shed when He did hang upon the cross on Mount Calvary.",Object.,"But you will say, ""Methinks, that giving of ourselves up to live a righteous life should make God like the better of us, and so let us be saved by Christ, because we are so willing to obey His law.""",Answ.,"The motive that moveth God to have mercy upon sinners is not because they are willing to follow the law, but because He is willing to save them.","""Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprighteous of thine heart dost thou go to possess their land"" (Deu 9:4-6).","Now understand this: if thy will to do righteousness was the first moving cause why God had mercy on thee through Christ, then it must not be freely by grace--I say, freely.","But the Lord loves thee and saves thee upon free terms, having nothing beforehand to make Him accept of thy soul, but only the blood of Christ; therefore to allow of such a principle it is to allow that grace is to be obtained by the works of the law, which is as gross darkness as lies in the darkest dungeon in Popery, and is also directly opposite to Scripture--For we are ""justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ""; not through the good that is in our selves, or done by us, no, ""but by faith, without""--mark that--""without the deeds of the law"" (Rom 3:24-28).","Again, ""Not of works, least any man should boast"" (Eph 2:9).","No, no, saith he, ""Not according to our works,"" or righteousness, ""but according to His own purpose""; mark ""according to His own purpose and grace, which was"" a free gift, ""given us in Christ Jesus,"" not lately, but ""before the world began"" (2 Tim 1:9).",Object.,"But you will say, ""Then why did God give the law, if we cannot have salvation by following of it?""",Answ.,I told you before that the law was given for these following reasons--1.,"That thou mightest be convinced by it of thy sins, and that thy sins might indeed appear very sinful unto thee, which is done by the law these ways--(1.)","By showing of thee what a holy God He is that did give the law; and, (2.)","By showing thee thy vileness and wickedness, in that thou, contrary to this holy God, hast transgressed against and broken this His holy Law; therefore, saith Paul, ""the law entered, that the offence might abound,"" that is, by showing the creature the holiness of God, and also its own vileness (Rom 5:20).",2.,That thou mayest know that God will not damn thee for nothing in the judgment-day.,3.,Because He would have no quarreling at His just condemning of them at that day.,4.,Because He will make thee to know that He is a holy God and pure.,WHAT MEN MAY ATTAIN TO THAT ARE UNDER THIS COVENANT OF WORKS.,[FOURTH] Quest.,"""But seeing you have spoken thus far, I wish you would do so much as to show in some particulars, both what men have done, and how far they have gone, and what they have received, being yet under this covenant, which you call the ministration of condemnation.""",Answ.,"This is somewhat a difficult question, and had need be not only warily, but also home and soundly answered.","The question consists of three particulars--First, What men have done;

secondly, they are said to go forth--that is, from the rudiments and traditions of men; thirdly, they do agree to take their lamps with them--that is, to profess themselves the servants of Jesus Christ, that wait upon Him, and for Him; and yet when He came, He found half of them, even the virgins, that had lamps, that also went forth from the pollutions of the world and the customs of men, to be such as lost their precious souls (verse 12) which they should not have done, had they been under the Covenant of Grace, and so not under the law.",2.,"They may attain to a great deal of honour in the said company of professors, that which may be accounted honour, insomuch that they may be put in trust with church affairs, and bear the bag, as Judas did.","I speak not this to shame the saints, but, being beloved, I warn them;

and Thou hast taught in our streets.""","Nay, further, ""Have we not prophesied in Thy name?","and in Thy name have cast out devils?""","Nay, not only thus, but, ""done many,"" mark, we have ""done many wonderful works.""","Nay, further, they were so confident, that they commanded, in a commanding way, saying, ""Lord, open to us.""","See here, I beseech you, how far these went;

lest though you think of having joy, you have ""weeping and gnashing of teeth.""",Third.,But the third thing touched in the question was this--What may such an one receive of God who is under the curse of the law?,1.,"They may receive an answer to their prayers from God at some times, for some things as they do stand in need of.",I find in Scripture that God did hear these persons that the Apostle saith were cast out (Gen 21:17).,"""And God heard the voice of the lad,"" even of cast-out Ishmael;

for God as their Creator hath a care for them, and causeth the sun to shine upon them, and the rain to distill upon their substance (Matt 5:45).","Nay, He doth give the beasts in the field their appointed food, and doth hear the young ravens when they cry, which are far inferior to man (Psa 147:9).","I say, therefore, that God doth hear the cries of His creatures, and doth answer them too, though not as to their eternal state; but may damn them nevertheless when they die for all that.",2.,They may receive promises from the mouth of the Lord.,"There are many that have promises made to them by the Lord in a most eminent way, and yet, as I said before, are such as are cast out and called the children of the bond-woman, which is the law--""And the angel of God called to Hagar out of Heaven,"" that was the bond-woman, saying, ""Fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.","Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; FOR I WILL MAKE HIM,""--mark, there is the promise,--""for I will make him,"" of the son of the bond-woman, ""a great nation"" (Gen 21:17,18).",3.,"Nay, they may go further; for they may receive another heart than they had before, and yet be under the law.","There is no man, I think, but those that do not know what they say, that will think or say that Saul was under the Covenant of Grace;

and also, that everything which hath not been planted by the Lord's right hand may be rejected, and that there may be a reaching after better things, even the things that will not only make thy soul think thy state is good now, but that thou mayest be able to look sin, death, Hell, the curse of the law, together with the Judge, in the face with comfort, having such a real, sound, effectual work of God's grace in thy soul, that when thou hearest the trumpet sound, seest the graves fly open, and the dead come creeping forth out of their holes; when thou shalt see the judgment set, the books opened, and all the world standing before the judgment-seat; I say, that then thou mayest stand, and have that blessed sentence spoken to thy soul, ""Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world"" (Matt 25:34).",[Objection to this head.],"But, you will say, for all this, We cannot believe that we are under the law, for these reasons--As, First.",Because we have found a change in our hearts.,Second.,Because we do deny that the Covenant of Works will save any.,Third.,"Because, for our parts, we judge ourselves far from legal principles; for we are got up into as perfect a Gospel order, as to matter of practice and discipline in church affairs, as any this day in England, as we judge.",[Answer to reason first.],"That man's belief that is grounded upon anything done in him, or by him only, that man's belief is not grounded upon the death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and intercession of Jesus Christ; for that man that hath indeed good ground of his eternal salvation, his faith is settled upon that object which God is well pleased or satisfied withal, which is that man that was born of Mary, even her first-born Son--that is, he doth apply by faith to his soul the virtues of His death, blood, righteousness, etc., and doth look for satisfaction of soul nowhere else than from that, neither doth the soul seek to give God any satisfaction as to justification any other ways; but doth willingly and cheerfully accept of and embrace the virtues of Christ's death, together with the rest of His things done by Himself on the cross as a sacrifice, and since also as a priest, advocate, mediator, etc.","; and doth so really and effectually receive the glories of the same, that thereby--mark that--thereby he is ""changed into the same image, from glory to glory"" (2 Cor 3:18).",Thus in general; but yet more particular-- 1.,"To think that your condition is good because there is some change in you from a loose profane life, to a more close, honest, and civil life and conversation; I say, to think this testimony sufficient to ground the stress of thy salvation upon is very dangerous.","First, because such a soul doth not only lay the stress of its salvation besides the man Christ Jesus that died upon the cross; but secondly, because that his confidence is not grounded upon the Saviour of sinners, but upon his turning from gross sins to a more refined life,--and it may be to the performance of some good duties--which is no Saviour; I say, this is very dangerous; therefore read it, and the Lord help you to understand it; for unless you lay the whole stress of the salvation of your souls upon the merits of another man--namely, Jesus--and that by what He did do and is adoing without you, for certain, as sure as God is in Heaven, your souls will perish.","And this must not be notionally neither, as with an assenting of the understanding only; but it must be by the wonderful, invisible, invincible power of the Almighty God, working in your souls by His Spirit such a real, saving, holy faith, that can, through the operation of the same Spirit by which it is wrought, lay hold on and apply these most heavenly, most excellent, most meritorious benefits of the man Christ Jesus, not only to your heads and fancies, but to your very souls and consciences, so effectually, that you may be able by the same faith to challenge the power, madness, malice, rage, and destroying nature either of sin, the law, death, the devil, together with Hell and all other evils, throwing your souls upon the death, burial, resurrection, and intercession of that man Jesus without (Rom 8:32-39).","But, 2.",Do you think that there was no change in the five foolish virgins spoken of (Matt 25:1-3).,"Yes; there was such a change in those very people, that the five wise ones could give them admittance of walking with them in the most pure ways and institutions of the Gospel of Christ, and yet but foolish; nay, they walked with them, or shall walk with them, until the Lord Jesus Christ shall break down from Heaven, and yet be but foolish virgins, and yet but under the law, and so under the curse, as I said before.",[Second part of objection.],"But, say you, We have disowned the Covenant of Works, and turned from that also.",[Answer to reason second.],This is sooner said than done.,"Alas, alas!","poor souls think because they say, ""Grace, grace, it is freely by grace,"" therefore they are under the Covenant of Grace.",A very wide mistake.,"You must understand thus much, that though you be such as can speak of the grace of the Gospel, yet if you yourselves be not brought under the very Covenant of Grace, you are yet, notwithstanding your talk and profession, very far wide of a sense and of a share in the Covenant of the Grace of God held forth in the Gospel.","The Jews were of a clearer understanding many of them than to conclude that the law, and only the law, was the way to salvation; for they, even they that received not the Christ of God, did expect a Saviour should come (John 7:27,41-43).","But they were men that had not the Gospel Spirit, which alone is able to lead them to the very life, marrow, or substance of the Gospel in right terms; and so being muddy in their understandings, being between the thoughts of a Saviour and the thoughts of the works of the law, thinking that they must be accomplished for the obtaining of a Saviour, and His mercy towards them; I say, between these they fell short of a Saviour.","As many poor souls in these days, they think they must be saved alone by the Saviour, yet they think there is something to be done on their parts for the obtaining of the good-will of the Saviour, as their humiliation for sin, their turning from the same, their promises, and vows, and resolutions to become new men, join in church-fellowship, and what not; and thus they, bringing this along with them as a means to help them, they fall short of eternal salvation if they are not converted; see that Scripture (Rom 9:30-32).","The Apostle saith there, that they that sought not did obtain, when they that did seek fell short.","""What shall we say then?""",saith he.,"""That the Gentiles which sought not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness,"" yea, ""even the righteousness which is of faith.""",And what else?,"Why, ""but Israel which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.""",How came that to pass?,"""Because,"" saith he, ""they sought it not by faith, but as it were""--mark, he doth not say, altogether, no, ""but as it were""--that is, because as they sought, they did a little by the bye lean upon the works of the law.","And let me tell you, that this is such a hard thing to beat men off of, that though Paul himself did take the work in hand, he did find enough to do touching it; how is he fain to labour in the ten first chapters of his Epistle to the Romans, for the establishing of those that did even profess largely in the doctrine of grace, and also in that Epistle to the Galatians; and yet lost many, do what he could.","Now, the reason why the doctrine of grace doth so hardly down--even with professors--in truth, effectually, it is because there is a principle naturally in man that doth argue against the same, and that thus: Why, saith the soul, I am a sinner, and God is righteous, holy, and just; His holy Law, therefore, having been broken by me, I must, by all means, if ever I look to be saved, in the first place, be sorry for my sins; secondly, turn from the same; thirdly, follow after good duties, and practise the good things of the law and ordinances of the Gospel, and so hope that God for Christ's sake may forgive all my sins; which is not the way to God as a Father in Christ, but the way, the very way to come to God by the Covenant of Works, or the law, which things I shall more fully clear when I speak to the second doctrine.","Again, therefore, those that this day profess the Gospel, for the generality of them they are such, that, notwithstanding their profession, they are very ignorant of that glorious influence and lustre of the same; I say, they are ignorant of the virtue and efficacy of the glorious things of Christ held forth by and in the Gospel, which doth argue their not being under the Covenant of Grace, but rather under the law or old covenant (2 Cor 4:3).","As, for instance, if you do come among some professors of the Gospel, in general you shall have them pretty busy and ripe; also able to hold you in a very large discourse in several points of the same glorious Gospel; but if you come to the same people and ask them concerning heart-work, or what work the Gospel hath wrought on them, and what appearance they have had of the sweet influences and virtues on their souls and consciences, it may be they will give you such an answer as this--I do find by the preaching thereof that I am changed, and turned from my sins in a good measure, and also have learned (but only in tongue), to distinguish between the law and the Gospel, so that for the one--that is, for the Gospel--I can plead, and also can show the weakness and unprofitableness of the other.","And thus far, it is like they may go, which is not far enough to prove them under the Covenant of Grace, though they may have their tongues so largely tipped with the profession of the same (2 Peter 2:20) where he saith ""For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,"" which was not a saving knowledge, ""they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end"" of that man ""is worse than the beginning"" (Matt 25:1-4, etc.",; Matt 7:22).,Object.,"But, you will say, is not this a fair declaring of the work of grace, or doth it not discover that, without all gainsaying, we are under the Covenant of Grace, when we are able, not only to speak of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ, but also to tell, and that by experience, that we have been changed from worse to better, from sin to a holy life, by leaving of the same, and that by hearing of the Word preached?",Answer 1.,"A man may, in the first place, be able to talk of all the mysteries of the Gospel, and that like an angel of God, and yet be no more in God's account than the sounding of a drum, brass, or the tinkling of a cymbal, which are things that, notwithstanding their sound and great noise, are absolutely void of life and motion, and so are accounted with God as nothing--that is, no Christians, no believers, not under the Covenant of Grace for all that (1 Cor 13:1-4).",2.,"Men may not only do this, but may also be changed in reality, for a season, from what they formerly were, and yet be nothing at all in the Lord's account as to an eternal blessing.","Read 2 Peter 2:20, the Scripture which I mentioned before; for, indeed, that one Scripture is enough to prove all that I desire to say as to this very thing; for, if you observe, there is enfolded therein these following things--(1.)",That reprobates may attain to a knowledge of Christ.,(2.),"This knowledge may be of such weight and force, that, for the present, it may make them escape the pollutions of the world, and this by hearing the Gospel.","""For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end of that man is worse than the beginning.""","[Some professors, take them at the best, they are but like dogs, spewing out their filth for a time.]","Now that they are reprobates, dogs, or sows, read further; ""But,"" saith he, ""it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire"" (Verse 22).",[Third part of objection.],The last part of the objection.,"But, say you, our practices in the worship of God shall testify for us that we are not under the law; for we have by God's goodness attained to as exact a way of waking in the ordinances of God, and as near the examples of the Apostles, as ever any churches since the primitive times, as we judge.",[Answer to reason third.],What then?,"Do you think that the walking in the order of the churches of old, as to matter of outward worship, is sufficient to clear you of your sins at the judgment-day?","or, do you think that God will be contented with a little bodily subjection to that which shall vanish and fade like a flower, when the Lord shall come from Heaven in flaming fire, with His mighty angels (2 Thess 1:7,8).","Alas, alas, how will such professors as these are fall before the judgment-seat of Christ!","Then such a question as this, ""Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment?""","will make them be speechless, and fall down into everlasting burnings, thousands on a heap; for you must know that it is not then your crying, Lord, Lord, that will stand you in stead; not your saying, We have ate and drank in Thy presence, that will keep you from standing on the left hand of Christ.",It is the principle as well as the practice that shall be inquired into at that day.,Quest.,"The principle, you will say, what do you mean by that?",Answ.,"My meaning is, the Lord Jesus Christ will then inquire and examine whether the spirit from which you acted was legal or evangelical--that is, whether it was the Spirit of adoption that did draw you out to the thing you took in hand, or a mere moral principle, together with some shallow and common illuminations into the outward way of the worship of God, according to Gospel rule.",Quest.,"But, you will say, it is like, How should this be made manifest and appear?",Answ.,"I shall speak briefly in answer hereunto as followeth--First, then, that man that doth take up any of the ordinances of God--namely, as prayer, baptism, breaking of bread, reading, hearing, alms-deeds, or the like; I say, he that doth practise any of these, or such like, supposing thereby to procure the love of Christ to his own soul, he doth do what he doth from a legal, and not from an evangelical or Gospel spirit: as thus--for a man to suppose that God will hear him for his prayer's sake, for his alm's sake, for his humiliation's sake, or because he hath promised to make God amends hereafter, whereas there is no such thing as a satisfaction to be made to God by our prayers or whatever we can do; I say, there is no such way to have reconciliation with God in.","And so also for men to think, because they are got into such and such an ordinance, and have crowded themselves into such and such a society, that therefore they have got pretty good shelter from the wrath of the Almighty; when, alas, poor souls, there is no such thing.","No, but God will so set His face against such professors, that His very looks will make them to tear their very flesh; yea, make them to wish would they had the biggest millstone in the world hanged about their neck, and they cast into the midst of the sea.","For, friends, let me tell you, though you can now content yourselves without the holy, harmless, undefiled, perfect righteousness of Christ; yet there is a day a-coming in which there is not one of you shall be saved but those that are and shall be found clothed with that righteousness; God will say to all the rest, ""Take them, bind them hand and foot, and cast them into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth"" (Matt 22:13).","For Christ will not say unto men in that day, Come, which of you made a profession of Me, and walked in church-fellowship with My saints: no; but then it shall be inquired into, who have the reality of the truth of grace wrought in their hearts.","And, for certain, he that misseth of that shall surely be cast into the Lake of Fire, there to burn with the devils and damned men and women; there to undergo the wrath of an eternal God, and that not for a day, a month, a year, but for ever, for ever, for ever and ever; there is that which cutteth to the quick.","Therefore, look to it, and consider now what you do, and whereon you hang your souls; for it is not every pin that will hold in the judgment, not every foundation that will be able to hold up the house against those mighty, terrible, soul-drowning floods and destroying tempests which then will roar against the soul and body of a sinner (Luke 6:47-49).","And, if the principle be rotten, all will fall, all will come to nothing.","Now, the principle is this--Not to do things because we would be saved, but to do them from this--namely, because we do really believe that we are and shall be saved.","But do not mistake me; I do not say we should slight any holy duties; God forbid; but I say, he that doth look for life because he doth do good duties, he is under the Covenant of Works, the law; let his duties be never so eminent, so often, so fervent, so zealous.","Ay, and I say, as I said before, that if any man or men, or multitudes of people, do get into never so high, so eminent; and clear practices and Gospel order, as to church discipline, if it be done to this end I have been speaking of, from this principle, they must and shall have these sad things fall to their share which I have made mention of.",Object.,"But, you will say, can a man use Gospel ordinances with a legal spirit?",Answ.,"Yes, as easily as the Jews could use and practise circumcision, though not the moral or Ten Commandments.","For this I shall be bold to affirm, that it is not the commands of the New Testament administration that can keep a man from using of its self [that administration] in a legal spirit; for know this for certain, that it is the principle, not the command, that makes the subjector to the same either legal or evangelical, and so his obedience from that command to be from legal convictions or evangelical principles.","Now, herein the devil is wondrous subtle and crafty, in suffering people to practise the ordinances and commands of the Gospel, if they do but do them in a legal spirit, [I beseech you, do not think because I say this, therefore I am against the ordinances of the Gospel, for I do honour them in their places, yet would not that any of them should be idolized, or done in a wrong spirit,] from a spirit of works; for he knows then, that if he can but get the soul to go on in such a spirit, though they do never so many duties, he shall hold them sure enough; for he knows full well that thereby they do set up something in the room of, or, at the least, to have some, though but a little, share with the Lord Jesus Christ in their salvation; and if he can but get thee here, he knows that he shall cause thee by thy depending a little upon the one, and so thy whole dependence being not upon the other, that is, Christ, and taking of him upon his own terms, thou wilt fall short of life by Christ, though thou do very much busy thyself in a suitable walking, in an outward conformity to the several commands of the Lord Jesus Christ.","And let me tell you plainly, that I do verily believe that as Satan by his instruments did draw many of the Galatians by circumcision (though, I say, it was none of the commands of the moral law) to be debtors to do upon pain of eternal damnation the whole of the moral law, so also Satan, in the time of the Gospel, doth use even the commands laid down in the Gospel, some of them, to bind the soul over to do the same law; the thing being done and walked in, by and in the spirit; for, as I said before, it is not the obedience to the command that makes the subjector thereto evangelical, or of a Gospel spirit; but, contrariwise, the principle that leads out the soul to the doing of the command, that makes the persons that do thus practise any command, together with the command by them practised, either legal or evangelical.","As, for instance, prayer--it is a Gospel command; yet if he that prays doth it in a legal spirit, he doth make that which in itself is a Gospel command an occasion of leading him into a Covenant of Works, inasmuch as he doth it by and in that old covenant spirit.","Again; giving of alms is a Gospel command; yet if I do give alms from a legal principle, the command to me is not Gospel, but legal, and it binds me over, as aforesaid, to do the whole law--""For he is not a Jew,"" nor a Christian, ""which is one outwardly""--that is, one only by an outward subjection to the ordinances of prayer, hearing, reading, baptism, breaking of bread, etc.--""But he is a Jew,"" a Christian, ""which is one inwardly,"" who is rightly principled, and practiseth the ordinances of the Lord from the leadings forth of the Spirit of the Lord, from a true and saving faith in the Lord (Rom 2:28,29).","Those men spoken of in the 7th of Matthew, for certain, for all their great declaration, did not do what they did from a right Gospel spirit; for had they, no question but the Lord would have said, ""Well done, good and faithful servant.""","But in that the Lord Jesus doth turn them away into Hell, notwithstanding their great profession of the Lord, and of their doing in His name, it is evident that notwithstanding all that they did do, they were still under the law, and not under that covenant as true believers are--to wit, the Covenant of Grace; and if so, then all their duties that they did, of which they boasted before the Lord, was not in and by a right evangelical principle or spirit.","Again, saith the Apostle, ""Whatsoever is not of faith is sin,"" (Rom 14:23); but there are some that do even practise baptism, breaking of bread, together with other ordinances, and yet are unbelievers; therefore unbelievers doing these things, they are not done in faith but sin.","Now to do these things in sin, or without faith, it is not to do things in an evangelical or Gospel spirit; also they that do these things in a legal spirit, the very practising of them renders them not under the law of Christ, as Head of His Church, but the works they do are so much contradiction to the Gospel of God, or the Covenant of Grace, that they that do them thus do even set up against the Covenant of Grace; and the very performance of them is of such force that it is sufficient to drown them that are subjects thereunto, even under the Covenant of Works; but this poor souls are not aware of, and there is their misery.",Quest.,"But have you no other way to discover the things of the Gospel, how they are done with a legal principle, but those you have already made mention of?",Answ.,"That thou mightest be indeed satisfied herein, I shall show you the very manner and way that a legal, or old-covenant-converted professor, bear with the terms, doth take both in the beginning, middle, and the end of his doing of any duty or command, or whatsoever it be that he doth do.",1.,"He thinking this or that to be his duty, and considering of the same, he is also presently persuaded in his own conscience that God will not accept of him if he leave it undone; he seeing that he is short of his duty, as he supposeth, while this is undone by him, and also judging that God is angry with him until the thing be done, he, in the second place, sets to the doing of the duty, to the end he may be able to pacify his conscience by doing of the same, persuading of himself that now the Lord is pleased with him for doing of it.",2.,"Having done it, he contents himself, sits down at his ease, until some further convictions of his duty to be done, which when he seeth and knoweth, he doth do it as aforesaid, from the same principle as he did the former, and so goeth on in his progress of profession.","This is to do things from a legal principle, and from an old-covenant spirit; for thus runs that covenant, ""The man that doth these things shall live in them,"" of ""by them"" (Lev 18:5; Gal 3:12; Rom 10:5).",But more of this in the use of this doctrine.,Object.,"But, you will say, by these words of yours you do seem to deny that there are conditional promises in the Gospel, as is clear, in that you strike at such practices as are conditional, and commanded to be done upon the same.",Answ.,"The thing that I strike at is this, that a man in or with a legal spirit should not, nay, cannot, do any conditional command of the Gospel acceptably, as to his eternal state, because he doth it in an old-covenant spirit.","""No man putteth new wine into old bottles""; but new wine must have new bottles, a Gospel command must have a Gospel spirit, or else the wine will break the bottles, or the principle will break the command.",Object.,"Then you do grant that there are conditional promises in the New Testament, as in the moral law, or Ten Commands.",Answ.,"Though this be true, yet the conditional promises in the New Testament do not call to the same people in the same state of unregeneracy to fulfill them upon the same conditions.","The Law and the Gospel being two distinct covenants, they are made in divers ways, and the nature of the conditions also being not the same, as saith the Apostle, the righteousness of the law saith one thing, and the righteousness of faith saith another (Rom 10:4-6).","That is, the great condition in the law is, If you do these things, you shall live by them; but the condition, even the greatest condition laid down for a poor soul to do, as to salvation--for it is that we speak of--is to believe that my sins be forgiven me for Jesus Christ's sake, without the works or righteousness of the law, on my part, to help forward.","""To him that worketh not,"" saith the Apostle [that is] for salvation, ""but believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith""--mark, ""his faith is counted for righteousness"" (Rom 4:5).","So that we, saith, he, ""conclude that a man is justified by faith without""--mark again, ""without the deeds of the law"" (Rom 3:28).","But again; there is never a condition in the Gospel that can be fulfilled by an unbeliever; and therefore, whether there be conditions or whether there be none, it makes no matter to thee who art without the faith of Christ; for it is impossible for thee in that state to do them, so as to be ever the better as to thy eternal estate; therefore, lest thou shouldst split thy soul upon the conditions laid down in the Gospel, as thou wilt do if thou go about to do them only with a legal spirit; but, I say, to prevent this, see if thou canst fulfill the first condition; that is, to believe that all thy sins are forgiven thee, not for any condition that hath been or can be done by thee, but merely for the Man's sake that did hang on Mount Calvary, between two thieves, some sixteen hundred years ago and odd.","And, I say, see if thou canst believe that at that time He did, when He hanged on the Cross, give full satisfaction, for all thy sins, before thou in thy person hadst committed ever a one.","I say, see if thou canst believe this; and take heed thou deceive not thyself with an historical, notional, or traditional acknowledgment of the same.","And, secondly, see if thou canst so well fulfill this condition, that the very virtue and efficacy that it hath on thy soul will engage thee to fulfill those other conditions, really in love to that Man whom thou shouldst believe hath frankly and freely forgiven thee all, without any condition acted by thee to move Him thereto, according to that saying in 2 Corinthians 5:14, 15; and then thy doing will arise from a contrary principle than otherwise it will do--that is, then thou wilt not act and do because thou wouldst be accepted of God, but because thou hast some good hope in thy heart that thou art accepted of Him already, and not on thine, but wholly and alone upon another man's account; for here runs the Gospel spirit of faith: ""We believe,""--mark, ""We believe, and therefore speak.""","So we believe, and therefore do (2 Cor 4:13).","Take heed, therefore, that you do not DO, that you may believe, but rather believe so effectually that you may DO, even all that Jesus doth require of you from a right principle, even out of love to your dear Lord Jesus Christ, which thing I shall speak to more fully by and by.",Object.,But what do you mean by those expressions?,"Do not do that you may believe, but believe so effectually that you may do.",Answ.,"When I say, Do not do that you may believe, I mean, do not think that any of the things that thou canst do will procure or purchase faith from God unto thy soul; for that is still the old-covenant spirit, the spirit of the law, to think to have it for thy doing.","They that are saved, they are saved by grace, through faith, and that not of themselves, not for anything that they can do, for they are both the free gift of God, ""Not of"" doing, or of ""works, lest any man should,"" be proud, and ""boast"" (Eph 2:8,9).","Now, some people be so ignorant as to think that God will give them Christ, and so all the merits of His, if they will be but valiant, and do something to please God, that they may obtain Him at His hands; but let me tell them, they may lose a thousand souls quickly, if they had so many, by going this way to work, and yet be never the better; for the Lord doth not give His Christ to any upon such conditions, but He doth give Him freely; that is, without having respect to anything that is in thee (Rev 22:17; Isa 55:1,2).","To him that is athirst will I give; He doth not say, I will sell; but, I will give him the water of life freely (Rev 21:6).","Now, if Christ doth give it, and that freely, then He doth not sell if for anything that is in the creature; but Christ doth give Himself, as also doth His Father, and that freely, not because there is anything in us, or done by us, that moves Him thereunto.","If it were by doing, then, saith Paul, ""Grace is not grace,"" seeing it is obtained by works; but grace is grace, and that is the reason it is given to men without their works.","And if it be by grace, that is, if it be a free gift from God, without anything foreseen as done, or to be done, by the creature, then it is not of works, which is clear; therefore it is grace, without the works of the law.","But if you say, Nay, it is of something in the man done by him that moves God thereunto; then you must conclude that either grace is no grace, or else that works are grace and not works.",Do but read with understanding (Rom 11:6).,"Now before I go any further, it may be necessary to speak a word or two to some poor souls that are willing to close in with Jesus Christ, and would willingly take Him upon His own terms, only they being muddy in their minds, and have not yet attained the understanding of the terms and conditions of the two covenants, they are kept off from closing with Christ; and all is, because they see they can do nothing [to merit His favour].","As, for example, come to some souls, and ask them how they do, they will tell you presently that they are so bad that it is not to be expressed.","If you bid them believe in Jesus Christ, they will answer that they cannot believe; if you ask them why they cannot believe, they will answer, because their hearts are so hard, so dead, so dull, so backward to good duties; and if their hearts were but better, if they were more earnest, if they could pray better, and keep their hearts more from running after sin, then they could believe; but should they believe with such vile hearts, and presume to believe in Christ, and be so filthy?","Now all this is because the spirit of the law still ruleth in such souls, and blinds them so that they cannot see the terms of the Gospel.","To clear this, take the substance or the drift of these poor souls, which is this--""If I were better, then I think I could believe; but being so bad as I am, that is the reason that I cannot.""","This is just to do something that I may believe, to work that I may have Christ, to do the law that I may have the Gospel; or thus, to be righteous that I may come to Christ.",O man!,"thou must go quite back again, thou art out of the way, thou must believe, because thou canst not pray, because thou canst not do; thou must believe, because there is nothing in thee naturally that is good, or desireth after good, or else thou wilt never come to Christ as a sinner; and if so, then Christ will not receive thee; and if so, then thou mayest see that to keep off from Christ because thou canst not do, is to be kept from Christ by the law, and to stand off from Him because thou canst not buy Him.","Thus having spoken something by the way for the direction of those souls that would come to Christ, I shall return to the former discourse, wherein ariseth this objection-- Object.","But you did but even now put souls upon fulfilling the first condition of the Gospel, even to believe in Christ, and so be saved; but now you say it is alone by grace, without condition; and therefore by these words, there is first a contradiction to your former sayings, and also that men may be saved without the condition of faith, which to me seems a very strange thing.","I desire, therefore, that you would clear out what you have said, to my satisfaction.","Answer, 1.","Though there be a condition commanded in the Gospel, yet He that commands the condition doth not leave His children to their own natural abilities, that in their own strength they should fulfill them, as the law doth; but the same God that doth command that the condition be fulfilled, even He doth help His children by His Holy Spirit to fulfill the same condition; ""For it is God which worketh in you,""--mark ""in you,"" believers, ""both to will and to do of His own good pleasure"" (Phil 2:13).","""Thou also hast wrought all our works in us, and for us"" (Isa 26:12).","So that, if the condition be fulfilled, it is not done by the ability of the creature.","But, 2.","Faith, as it is a gift of God, or an act of ours, take it which way you will, if we speak properly of salvation, it is not the first nor the second cause of our salvation, but the third, and that but instrumentally neither--that is, it only layeth hold of and applieth to us that which saveth us, which is the love of God, through the merits of Christ, which are the two main causes of our salvation, without which all other things are nothing, whether it be faith, hope, love, or whatever can be done by us.","And to this the great Apostle of the Gentiles speaks fully, for, saith he, ""God, who is rich in mercy, loved us, even when we were dead in sins"" (Eph 2:4,5).","That is, when we were without faith, and that was the cause why we believed for He thereby hath quickened us together, through the meritorious cause, which is Christ, and so hath saved us by grace--that is, of His own voluntary love and good will; the effect of which was this, He gave us faith to believe in Christ.",Read soberly Ephesians 2:4-8.,"Faith, as the gift of God, is not the Saviour, as our act doth merit nothing; faith was not the cause that God gave Christ as the first, neither is it the cause why God converts men to Christ; but faith is a gift bestowed upon us by the gracious God, the nature of which is to lay hold on Christ, that God afore did give for a ransom to redeem sinners; this faith hath its nourishment and supplies from the same God that at the first did give it, and is the only instrument, through the Spirit, that doth keep the soul in a comfortable frame, both to do and suffer for Christ; helps the soul to receive comfort from Christ when it can get none from itself, beareth up the soul in its progress heavenwards.","But that it is the first cause of salvation, that I deny, or that it is the second, I deny; but it is only the instrument, or hand, that receiveth the benefits, that God hath prepared for thee before thou hadst any faith; so that we do nothing for salvation as we are men.","But if we speak properly, it was God's grace that moved Him to give Christ a ransom for sinners; and the same God, with the same grace, that doth give to the soul faith to believe, and so, by believing, to close in with Him whom God out of His love and pity did send into the world to save sinners, so that all the works of the creature are shut out as to justification and life, and men are saved freely by grace.","I shall speak no more here; but in my discourse upon the second covenant, I shall answer a Hell-bred objection or two, to forewarn sinners how they turn the grace of God into wantonness.","And thus, you see, I have briefly spoken to you something touching the law.","First, what it is, and when given; secondly, how sad those men's conditions are that are under it; thirdly, who they are that be under it; fourthly, how far they may go, and what they may do and receive, and yet be under it; which hath been done by way of answers to several questions, for the better satisfaction of those that may stand in doubt of the truth of what hath been delivered.","Now, in the next place, I shall come to some application of the truth of that which hath been spoken; but I shall in the first place speak something to the second doctrine, and then afterwards I shall speak something by way of use and application to this first doctrine.",[DOCTRINE SECOND.],"The second doctrine now to be spoken to is, TO SHOW THAT THE PEOPLE OF GOD ARE NOT UNDER THE LAW BUT UNDER GRACE--""For ye are not under the law, but under grace"" (Rom 6:14).","You may well remember that from these words I did observe these two great truths of the Lord--FIRST, That there are some in Gospel times that are under the law, or Covenant of Works.","SECOND, That there is never a believer under the law, or Covenant of Works, but under grace.","I have spoken something to the former of these truths--to wit, that there are some under the law, together with who they are, and what their condition is, that are under it.","Now I am to speak to the second, and to show you who they are, and what their condition is, that are under that [Covenant of Grace].","But before I come to that, I shall speak a few words to show you what the word ""grace"" in this place signifies; [I touched upon this in the first doctrine] for the word ""grace"" in the Scripture referreth sometimes to favour with men (Gen 33:10; 39:4; 50:4).",Sometimes to holy qualifications of saints (2 Cor 8:7).,"And sometimes to hold forth the condescension of Christ in coming down from the glory which He had with His Father before the world was, to be made of no reputation, and a servant to men (2 Cor 8:9; Phil 2:7).","Again: sometimes it is taken for the free, rich, and unchangeable love of God to man, through Jesus Christ, that for our cause and sakes did make Himself poor; and so it is to be understood in these words, ""For ye are not under the law,"" to be cursed, and damned, and sent headlong to Hell, ""but"" you are ""under grace,"" to be saved, to be pardoned, to be preserved, ""and kept by the mighty power of God, through faith,"" which alone is the gift of grace, ""unto eternal glory.""","This one Scripture alone proves the same--""For by grace are ye saved"" (Eph 2:8), by free grace, by rich grace, by unchangeable grace.","And you are saved from the curse of the law; from the power, guilt, and filth of sin; from the power, malice, madness, and rage of the devil; from the wishes, curses, and desires of wicked men; from the hot, scalding, flaming, fiery furnace of Hell; from being arraigned as malefactors, convinced, judged, condemned, and fettered with the chains of our sins to the devils to all eternity; and all this freely, freely by His grace (Rom 3:24) by rich grace unchangeable grace; for, saith He, ""I am the LORD, I change not: therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed"" (Mal 3:6).",This is grace indeed.,"The word ""grace,"" therefore, in this Scripture (Rom 6:14) is to be understood of the free love of God in Christ to sinners, by virtue of the new covenant, in delivering them from the power of sin, from the curse and condemning power of the old covenant, from the destroying nature of sin, by its continual workings; as is all evident if you read with understanding the words as they lie--""For,"" saith he, ""sin shall not have dominion over you,"" or, it shall not domineer, reign, or destroy you, though you have transgressed against the Covenant of Works, the law; and the reason is rendered in these words, ""For ye are not under the law""--that is, under that which accuseth, chargeth, condemneth and brings execution on the soul for sin,--""but under grace""; that is, under that which frees you, forgives you, keeps you, and justifies you from all your sins, adversaries, or whatever may come in to lay anything to your charge to damn you.","For that is truly called grace in this sense that doth set a man free from all his sins, deliver him from all the curses of the law, and what else can be laid to His charge, freely, without any foresight in God to look at what good will be done by the party that hath offended; and also that doth keep the soul by the same power through faith--which also is his own proper gift--unto eternal glory.","Again; that it is a pardon not conditional, but freely given, consider, first, it is set in opposition to works--""Ye are not under the law.""","Secondly, The promise that is made to them (saying, ""Sin shall not have dominion over you"") doth not run with any condition as on their part to be done; but merely and alone because they were under, or because they had the grace of God extended to them.","""Sin shall not have dominion over you: for,"" mark the reason, ""ye are not under the law, but under grace.""","The words being thus opened, and the truth thus laid down, HOW THERE IS NEVER A BELIEVER UNDER THE COVENANT OF WORKS, BUT UNDER GRACE, the free, rich, unchangeable love of God, it remaineth that, in the first place, we prove the doctrine, and after that proceed.",THE DOCTRINE PROVED.,"Now in the doctrine there are two things to be considered and proved--FIRST, That believers are under grace.","SECONDLY, Not under the law as a Covenant of Works; for so you must understand me.","For these two we need go no further than the very words themselves; the first part of the words proves the first part of the doctrine, ""Ye are not under the law""; the second part proves the other, ""but"" ye are ""under grace.""","But besides these, consider with me a few things for the demonstrating of these truths, as, First.","They are not under the law, because their sins are pardoned, which could not be if they were dealt withal according to the law, and their being under it; for the law alloweth of no repentance, but accuseth, curseth and condemneth every one that is under it--""Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them"" (Gal 3:10).","But, I say, believers having their sins forgiven them, it is because they are under another, even a new covenant--""Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with them.""","--""For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more"" (Heb 8:12).",Second.,"They are not under the law, because their sins and iniquities are not only forgiven, but they are forgiven them freely.","They that stand in the first covenant, and continue there, are to have never a sin forgiven them unless they can give God a complete satisfaction; for the law calls for it at their hands, saying, ""Pay me that thou owest.""",O!,"but when God deals with His saints by the Covenant of Grace it is not so; for it is said, ""And when"" He saw ""they had nothing to pay, He frankly"" and freely ""forgave them"" all--""I will heal their backsliding; I will love them freely.""","--I will blot ""out thy transgressions for Mine own sake,"" etc.",(Luke 7:42; Hosea 14:4; Isa 43:25).,Third.,"The saints are not under the law, because the righteousness that they stand justified before God in is not their own actual righteousness by the law, but by imputation, and is really the righteousness of Another--namely, of God in Christ (2 Cor 5:21; Phil 3:9).","""Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all,"" that is, imputed to ""them that believe"" (Rom 3:22).","But if they were under the old covenant, the Covenant of Works, then their righteousness must be their own, [But it is impossible that the righteousness of man by the law should save him.]","or no forgiveness of sins--""If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?""","but if thou transgress, ""sin lieth at the door,"" saith the law (Gen 4:7).",Fourth.,"In a word, whatsoever they do receive, whether it be conversion to God; whether it be pardon of sin; whether it be faith or hope; whether it be righteousness; whether it be strength"" whether it be the Spirit, or the fruits thereof; whether it be victory over sin, death, or Hell; whether it be Heaven, everlasting life, and glory inexpressible; or whatsoever it be, it comes to them freely, God having no first eye to what they would do, or should do, for the obtaining of the same.",But to take this in pieces--1.,"In a word, are they converted?","God finds them first, for, saith He, ""I am found of them that sought Me not"" (Isa 65:1).",2.,Have they pardon of sin?,"They have that also freely,--""I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely"" (Hosea 14:4).",3.,Have they faith?,"It is the gift of God in Christ Jesus, and He is not only the Author, that is, the beginner thereof, but He doth also perfect the same (Heb 12:2).",4.,Have they hope?,"It is God that is the first cause thereof--""Remember the word unto Thy servant, upon which Thou hast caused me to hope"" (Psa 119:49).",5.,Have they righteousness?,It is the free gift of God (Rom 5:17).,"Have they strength to do the work of God in their generations, or any other thing that God would have them do?","That also is a free gift from the Lord, for without Him we neither do nor can do anything (John 15:5).",7.,"Have we comfort, or consolation?","We have it not for what we have done, but from God through Christ; for He is the God of all comforts and consolation (2 Cor 1:3-7).",8.,"Have we the Spirit, or the fruits thereof?","it is the gift of the Father--""how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him (Luke 11:13)?","""Thou has wrought all our works in us"" (Isa 26:12).","And so, I say, whether it be victory over sin, death, Hell, or the devil, it is given us by the victory of Christ--""But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ"" (1 Cor 15:57; Rom 7:24,25).",Heaven and glory it is also the gift of Him who giveth us richly all things to enjoy (Matt 25:34).,"So that these things, if they be duly and soberly considered, will give satisfaction in this thing.",I might have added many more for the clearing of these things; as 1.,"When God came to man to convert him, He found him a dead man (Eph 2:1,2).","He found him an enemy to God, Christ, and the salvation of his own soul; He found him wallowing in all manner of wickedness; He found him taking pleasure therein; with all delight and greediness.",2.,"He was fain to quicken him by putting His Spirit into him, and to translate him by the mighty operation thereof.","He was fain to reveal Christ Jesus unto him, man being altogether senseless and ignorant of this blessed Jesus (Matt 11:25,27; 1 Cor 2:7-10).",4.,"He was fain to break the snare of the devil, and to let poor man, poor bound and fettered man, out of the chains of the enemy.","[THE NEW COVENANT FREE AND UNCHANGEABLE, WHO ARE UNDER IT, AND THEIR PRIVILEGES.]","Now we are to proceed, and the things that we are to treat upon in the second place are these--First.",[Besides the reasons already given.],Why is it a free and unchangeable grace?,SECOND.,"Who they are that are actually brought into His free and unchangeable Covenant of Grace, and how they are brought in?",THIRD.,What are the privileges of those that are actually brought into this free and glorious grace of the glorious God of Heaven and glory?,[THE NEW COVENANT FREE AND UNCHANGEABLE BECAUSE MADE WITH CHRIST.],FIRST.,WHY IT IS A FREE AND UNCHANGEABLE GRACE.,"And for the opening of this we must consider, first, How and through Whom this grace doth come to be, first, free to us, and, secondly, unchangeable?","This grace is free to us through conditions in Another--that is, by way of covenant or bargain; for this grace comes by way of covenant or bargain to us, yet made with Another for us.",First.,"That it comes by way of covenant, contract, or bargain, though not personally with us, be pleased to consider these Scriptures, where it is said, ""I have made a covenant with My Chosen: I have sworn unto David [The word David in this place signifieth Christ, as also in these Scriptures--(Eze 34:23,24; 37:24,25).]","My servant"" (Psa 89:3).","""And as for Thee also, by the blood of Thy covenant,"" speaking of Christ, ""I have sent forth Thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water,"" (Zech 9:9-11).","Again; ""Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money"" (Isa 52:3).","""Blessed be the Lord,"" therefore, saith Zacharias, ""for He hath visited and"" also ""redeemed His people, and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David; as He spake by the mouth of His holy Prophets, which have been since the world began; that we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hands of all that hate us; to perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant,"" or bargain (Luke 1:68-72).",[I might give you more Scriptures; but pray consider the second thing.],"And if any should be offended with the plainness of these words, as some poor souls may be through ignorance, let them be pleased to read soberly Isaiah 49:1-12, and there they may see that it runs as plain a bargain as if two would be making of a bargain between themselves, and concluding upon several conditions on both sides.",But more of this hereafter.,"Now, Second.","This covenant, I say, was made with One, not with many, and also confirmed in the conditions of it with One, not with several.","First, that the covenant was made with One (Gal 3:16).","""Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made.","He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy Seed, which is Christ"" (Verse 17).","""And this, I say, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God, in Christ,"" etc.","The covenant was made with the Seed of Abraham; not the seeds, but the Seed, which is the Lord Jesus Christ, our Head and Undertaker in the things concerning the covenant.",Third.,"The condition was made with One, and also accomplished by Him alone, and not by several; yet in the nature, and for the everlasting deliverance of many; even by one man Jesus Christ, as it is clear from Romans 5:15-17, etc., and in Zechariah 9:11, the Lord saith to Christ, ""And as for Thee""--mark, ""As for Thee also, by the blood of Thy covenant,"" or as for Thee whose covenant was by blood; that is, the condition of the covenant was, that Thou shouldst spill Thy blood; which having been done in the account of God, saith He, I according to My condition have let go the prisoners, or sent them ""out of the pit wherein is no water.""","Those Scriptures in Galatians 3:16,17 that are above cited, are notably to our purpose; Verse 16 saith it was made with Christ, Verse 17 saith it was also confirmed in or with God in Him.",Pray read with understanding.,"""Now,"" saith Paul, ""the promises were not made unto seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy Seed, which is Christ.""",.,.,.,.,"""The law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.""","Not that the covenant was made with Abraham and Christ together, as two persons that were the undertakers of the same; the promise was made with, or to, Abraham afterwards; but the covenant with Christ before.",[Neither Abraham nor the fathers able to undertake the accomplishment of this covenant.],"Further, that the covenant was not personally made with Abraham, no, nor with any of the fathers, neither so as that they were the persons that should stand engaged to be the accomplishers thereof, either in whole or in part; which is very clear.",First.,"Because this covenant was not made with God and the creature; not with another poor Adam, that only stood upon the strength of natural abilities; but this covenant was made with the second Person, with the Eternal Word of God; with Him that was everyways as holy, as pure, as infinite, as powerful, and as everlasting as God (Prov 8:22-31; Isa 9:6; Zech 13:7; Phil 2:6; Heb 1; Rev 1:11-17; 22:13,17).",Second.,This covenant or bargain was made in deed and in truth before man was in being.,O!,"God thought of the salvation of man before there was any transgression of man; for then, I say, and not since then, was the Covenant of Grace made with the Undertaker thereof; for all the other sayings are to show unto us that glorious plot and contrivance that was concluded on before time between the Father and the Son, which may very well be concluded on for a truth from the Word of God, if you consider, 1.",That the Scripture doth declare that the price was agreed on by the Son before time; 2.,The promise was made to Him by the Father that He should have His bargain before time; 3.,"The choice, and who they were that should be saved was made before time, even before the world began.",1.,"For the first, That the price was agreed upon before the world began.","Consider the word which speaketh of the price that was paid for sinners, even the precious blood of Christ; it saith of Him, ""Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, who by Him do believe,"" etc.","(1 Peter 1:20,21).","Mark, it was foreordained or concluded on between the Father and the Son before the world began.",2.,"The promise from God to the Son was also made in the same manner, as it is clear where the Apostle saith with comfort to his soul, that he had ""hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began,"" (Titus 1:2) which could be to none but the Mediator of the new covenant, because there was none else to whom it should be made but He.",3.,"The choice was also made then, even before man had a being in this world, as it is evident where he saith, ""Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places IN Christ: according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love"" (Eph 1:3,4).","[Did I think this would meet with any opposition, I should be in this more large.]","Nay, did I look upon it here to be necessary, I should show you very largely and clearly that God did not only make the covenant with Christ before the world began, and the conditions thereof, but I could also show you that the very saints' qualifications, as part of the covenant, was then concluded on by the Father and the Son according to these Scriptures, which, it may be, I may touch upon further anon (Eph 1:3,4; 2:10; Rom 8:28).","But, Third.","This covenant was not made with any of the fathers, neither in whole nor in part, as the undertakers thereof; for then it must be also concluded that they are co-partners with Christ in our salvation, and so that Christ is not Mediator alone; but this would be blasphemy for any once to surmise.","And therefore, by the way, when thou readest of the new covenant in Scripture as though it was made with Adam, Noah, Abraham, or David, thou art to consider thus with thyself--1.","That God spake to them in such a way for to show or signify unto us how He did make the covenant that He did make with Christ before the world began, they being types of Him.",2.,"That He thereby might let them understand that He was the same then as He is now, and now as He was then; and that then it was resolved on between His Son and HIM, that in after ages His Son should in their natures, from their loins, and for their sins, be born of a woman, hanged on the Cross, etc., for them: for all along you may see that when He speaketh to them of the new covenant, He mentions their seed--their seed--still aiming at Christ; Christ, the Seed of the woman, was to break the serpent's head (Gen 3:15; 17; Psa 89:36).","Now to Abraham and his Seed was the promise made; his Seed shall endure for ever, and His throne as the days of Heaven, etc.",; still pointing at Christ.,"And, 3.","To stir up their faith and expectations to be constant unto the end in waiting for that which He and His Son had concluded on before time, and what He had since the conclusion declared unto the world by the Prophets.",4.,"It appeareth that the heart of God was much delighted therein also, as is evident, in that He was always in every age declaring of that unto them which before He had prepared for them.",O this good God of Heaven!,"Objection: But you will say, perhaps, the Scriptures say plainly that the new covenant was and is made with believers, saying, ""The days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I led them out of the land of Egypt,"" etc.",(Heb 8:8-10).,"So that it doth not run with Christ alone, but with believers also--I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and Judah, etc.",(Jer 31:33).,"Answer first: It cannot be meant that the new covenant was made with Christ, and the house of Israel and Judah as the undertakers thereof; for so it was made with Christ alone, which is clear, in that it was made long before the house of Israel and Judah had a being, as I showed before.","But, Answer second: These words here are spoken, first, to show rather the end of the ceremonies than the beginning or rise of the new covenant.","Mind a little; the Apostle is labouring to beat the Jews, to whom he wrote this Epistle, off of the ceremonies of the law, of the priests, altar, offerings, temple, etc., and to bring them to the right understanding of the thing and things that they held forth, which were to come, and to put an end to those.","If you do but understand the Epistle to the Hebrews, it is a discourse that showeth that the Son of God being come, there is an end put to the ceremonies; for they were to continue so long and no longer--""It,"" saith the Apostle, ""stood in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation""; that is, until Christ did come.","""But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come,"" etc., puts an end to the things and ordinances of the Levitical priesthood.","Read the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th Chapters of Hebrews, and you will find this true.","So, then, when He saith, ""The days come in which I make a new covenant,"" it is rather to be meant a changing of the administration, taking away the type, the shadow, the ceremonies from the house of Israel and Judah, and relieving by the birth of Christ, and the death of Christ, and the offering of the body of Him whom the shadows and types did point out to be indeed He whom God the Father had given for a ransom by covenant for the souls of the saints; and also to manifest the truth of that covenant which was made between the Father and the Son before the world began; for though the new covenant was made before the world began, and also every one in all ages was saved by the virtue of that covenant, yet that covenant was never so clearly made manifest as at the coming, death, and resurrection of Christ; and therefore, saith the Scripture, ""He hath brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel.""","""Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling"" not according to the ""works"" of righteousness which we have done, ""but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,"" there is the covenant, but it was ""made MANIFEST by the APPEARING of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and brought life and immortality to LIGHT through the Gospel"" (2 Tim 1:9,10).","Therefore, I say, these words are therefore to discover that the time was come to change the dispensation, to take away the type, and bring in the substance, and so manifesting that more clearly which before lay hid in dark sayings and figures.",And this is usual with God to speak in this manner.,"Again; if at any time you do find in Scripture that the Covenant of Works is spoken of as the first covenant that was manifested, and so before the second covenant, yet you must understand that it was so only as to manifestation--that is, it was first given to man, yet not made before that which was made with Christ; and indeed it was requisite that it should be given or made known first, that thereby there might be a way made for the second, by its discovering of sin, and the sad state that man was in after the Fall by reason of that.","And again, that the other might be made the more welcome to the sons of men.","Yet the second Adam was before the first, and also the second covenant before the first.",[This is a riddle].,"And in this did Christ in time most gloriously answer Adam, who was the figure of Christ, as well as of other things.",Romans 5.,"For, Was the first covenant made with the first Adam?","so was the second covenant made with the second; for these are and were the two great public persons, or representators of the whole world, as to the first and second covenants; and therefore you find God speaking on this wise in Scripture concerning the new covenant--""My covenant shall stand fast with HIM.""","""My mercy will I keep for HIM for evermore,"" saith God: ""My covenant shall stand fast with HIM"" (Psa 89:28,34,35); this HIM is Christ, if you compare this with Luke 1:32, ""My covenant will I not break""--namely, that which was made with HIM--""nor alter the thing that is gone out of My mouth.","Once I have sworn by My holiness that I will not lie unto David,"" [David here is to be understood Christ.]","to whom this was spoken figuratively in the Person of Christ; for that was God's usual way to speak of the glorious things of the Gospel in the time of the Law, as I said before.",The conditions of the new covenant.,"The conditions also were concluded on and agreed to be fulfilled by Him: as it is clear, if you understand His saying in the 12th of John, at the 27th verse, where He foretelleth His death, and saith, ""Now is My soul troubled; and what shall I say?","Father, save Me from this hour: but for this cause came I"" into the world ""unto this hour""; as if He had said, My business is now not to shrink from My sufferings that are coming upon Me; for these are the things that are a great part of the conditions contracted in the covenant which stands between My Father and Me; therefore I shall not pray that this might be absolutely removed from Me; For, ""for this cause came I"" into the world; even this was the very terms of the covenant.","By this you may see, ""we are under grace.""",Now in a covenant there are these three things to be considered--First.,What it is that is covenanted for.,Second.,The conditions upon which the persons who are concerned in it do agree.,Third.,"If the conditions on both sides be not according to the agreement fulfilled, then the covenant standeth not, but is made void.",And this new covenant in these particulars is very exactly fulfilled and made out in Christ.,First.,"The thing or things covenanted for was the salvation of man, but made good in Christ--""The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.","The Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.",I gave My life a ransom for many.,"And this is the will,"" or covenant, ""of Him that sent Me, that of all which He hath given Me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day"" (John 6:39).",Second.,"As touching the conditions agreed on, they ran thus--1.","On the Mediator's side, that He should come into the world; and then on the Father's side, that He should give Him a body.","This was one of the glorious conditions between the Father and Christ; ""Wherefore, when He cometh into the world, He saith, Sacrifice and offering Thou wouldest not""--that is, the old covenant must not stand, but give way to another sacrifice which Thou hast prepared, which is the giving up My Manhood to the strokes of Thy justice--""for a body Thou hast prepared Me"" (Heb 10:5).",This doth prove us under grace.,2.,"On the Mediator's side, that He should be put to death; and on God the Father's side, that He should raise Him up again; this was concluded on also to be done between God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ.","On Christ's side, that He should die to give the justice of His Father satisfaction, and so to take away the curse that was due to us, wretched sinners, by reason of our transgressions; and that God His Father, being every ways fully and completely satisfied, should by His mighty power revive and raise Him up again.","He hath ""brought again--our Lord Jesus""; that is, from death to life, through the virtue or effectual satisfaction that He received from the blood that was shed according to the terms ""of the Everlasting Covenant"" (Heb 13:20).",3.,"On the Mediator's side, that He should be made a curse; and on the Father's side, that through Him sinners should be inheritors of the blessing.","What wonderful love doth there appear by this in the heart of our Lord Jesus, in suffering such things for our poor bodies and souls?","(Gal 3:13,14).",This is grace.,4.,"That on the Mediator's side there should be by Him a victory over Hell, death, and the devil, and the curse of the Law; and on the Father's side, that these should be communicated to sinners, and they set at liberty thereby--""Turn you to the stronghold,"" saith God, ""ye prisoners of hope; even today do I declare that I will render double unto thee"" (Zech 9:12).",Why so?,"It is because of the blood of My Son's covenant (Verse 11); which made Paul, though sensible of a body of death, and of the sting that death did strike into the souls of all those that are found in their sins, bold to say, ""O death!",where is thy sting?,O grave!,where is thy victory?,"The sting of death is sin.""","That is true, and the terrible Law of God doth aggravate and set it home with insupportable torment and pain.",But shall I be daunted at this?,"No, ""I thank my God through Jesus Christ He hath given me this victory.""","So that now, though I be a sinner in myself, yet I can, by believing in Jesus Christ, the Mediator of this new covenant, triumph over the devil, sin, death, and Hell; and say, Do not fear, my soul, seeing the victory is obtained over all my enemies through my Lord Jesus Christ (1 Cor 15:55-57).",This is the way to prove ourselves under grace.,5.,"That on the Mediator's side He should by thus doing bring in everlasting righteousness for saints (Dan 9:24); and that the Father for this should give them an everlasting kingdom (1 Peter 1:3-5; Eph 1:4; 2 Tim 4:18; Luke 22:28,29).","But, Third.",[How the conditions are fulfilled].,"In the next place, this was not all--that is, the Covenant of Grace, with the conditions thereof, was not only concluded on by both parties to be done, but Jesus Christ [Christ is put into office by the Father, to do all things contained in the new covenant].",must be authorized to do what was concluded on touching this covenant by way of office.,"I shall therefore speak a word or two also touching the offices, at least, some of them, that Christ Jesus did and doth still execute as the Mediator of the new covenant, which also were typed out in the Levitical law; for this is the way to prove that we are not under the law, but under grace.","And, Christ is the Surety of the new covenant.",FIRST.,"His first office, after the covenant was made and concluded upon, was that Jesus should become bound as a Surety, [His Suretyship].","and stand engaged upon oath to see that all the conditions of the covenant that were concluded on between Him and His Father should, according to the agreement, be accomplished by Him; and that after that, He should be the Messenger from God to the world to declare the mind of God touching the tenor and nature of both the covenants, especially of the new one.","The Scripture saith, that Jesus Christ was not only made a priest by an oath, but also a Surety, or bondsman, as in Hebrews 7:21, 22.","In the 21st Verse he speaketh of the priesthood of Christ, that it was with an oath; and saith, in the 22nd Verse, ""By so much"" also ""was Jesus made a Surety of a better testament,"" or covenant.","Now the covenant was not only made on Jesus Christ's side with an oath, but also on God the Father's side, that it might be for the better ground of establishment to all those that are, or are to be, the children of the promise.","Methinks it is wonderful to consider that the God and Father of our souls, by Jesus Christ, should be so bent upon the salvation of sinners, that He would covenant with His Son Jesus for the security of them, and also that there should pass an oath on both sides for the confirmation of Their resolution to do good.","As if the Lord had said, My Son, Thou and I have here made a covenant, that I on My part should do thus and thus, and that Thou on Thy part shouldst do so and so.","Now that We may give these souls the best ground of comfort that may be, there shall pass an oath on both sides, that Our children may see that We do indeed love them.","""Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel,"" in making of the covenant, ""confirmed it by an oath: that we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us"" (Heb 6:17,18; 7:21).","Mark, the 6th Chapter saith, God confirmed His part by an oath; and the 7th saith, Christ was made or set on His office also by an oath.","Again, ""Once,"" saith God, ""have I sworn by My holiness, that I will not lie unto David,"" ""nor alter the thing that is gone out of My mouth,"" (Psa 89:34,35) as was before cited.","Herein you may see that God and Christ were in good earnest about the salvation of sinners; for as soon as ever the covenant was made, the next thing was, who should be bound to see all those things fulfilled which were conditioned on between the Father and the Son: the angels, they could have no hands in it; the world could not do it; the devils had rather see them damned than they would wish them the least good; thus Christ looked, and there was none to help; though the burden lay never so heavy upon His shoulder, He must bear it Himself; for there was none besides Himself to uphold, or so much as to step in to be bound, to see the conditions, before mentioned, fulfilled neither in whole nor in part (Isa 63:1-7).","So that He must not be only He with whom the covenant was made, but He must also become the bondsman or surety thereof, and so stand bound to see that all and every particular thing conditioned for should be, both in manner, and matter, at the time and place, according to the agreement, duly and orderly fulfilled.",Is not this grace?,"Now as touching the nature of a surety and his work, in some things it is well known to most men; therefore I shall be very brief upon it.",First.,"You know a surety is at the bargain's making; and so was Christ--""Then was I beside Him"" (Prov 8:30).",Second.,"A surety must consent to the terms of the agreement, or covenant; and so did Christ Jesus.","Now that which He did engage should be done for sinners, according to the terms of the covenant; it was this--1.","That there should be a complete satisfaction given to God for the sins of the world; for that was one great thing that was agreed upon when the covenant was made (Heb 10:5,17).",2.,"That Jesus Christ should, as aforesaid, bring in an everlasting righteousness to clothe the saints (His body) withal (Dan 9:24,25).",Here is grace.,3.,"That He should take in charge to see all those forthcoming without spot or wrinkle at the day of His glorious appearing from Heaven in judgment, and to quit them before the Judgment-seat.","Again, Third.",In the work of a surety there is required by the creditor that the surety should stand to what he is bound; and on the surety's side there is a consenting thereunto.,1.,"The creditor looks, that in case the debtor proves a bankrupt, that then the surety should engage the payment.",Is not this grace?,"[However it is in other engagements, it is thus in this].",2.,The creditor looks that the surety should be an able man.,"Now our Surety was, and is, in this case, every way suitable; for He is heir of all things.",3.,"The creditor appoints the day, and also looks that the covenant should be kept, and the debt paid, according to the time appointed; and it is required of sureties, as well as stewards, that they be found faithful--namely, to pay the debt according to the bargain; and therefore it is said, ""When the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son--made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law,"" (Gal 4:4,5).",Thus comes grace to saints.,4.,"The creditor looks that his money should be brought into his house, to his own habitation.","Jesus, our Surety, in this also is faithful; for by His own blood, which was the payment, He is entered into the holy place, even into Heaven itself, which is God's dwelling-place, to render the value and price that was agreed upon for the salvation of sinners.","But I shall speak more of this in another head, therefore I pass it.","Again, Fourth.","If the surety stands bound, the debtor is at liberty; and if the law do issue out any process to take any, it will be the surety.","[Though the debtor, together with the surety, is liable to pay the debt by the law of man, yet Christ our Surety only by the Covenant of Grace].","And, O!","how wonderfully true was this accomplished in that, when Christ our Surety came down from Heaven, God's Law did so seize upon the Lord Jesus, and so cruelly handle Him, and so exact upon Him, that it would never let Him alone until it had accused Him and condemned Him, executed Him, and screwed His very heart's blood out of His precious heart and side; nay, and more than this too, as I shall show hereafter.","But, Christ the Messenger of the new covenant.",SECOND.,[His second office].,"After that Jesus Christ had stood bound, and was become our Surety in things pertaining to this covenant, His next office was to be the Messenger of God touching His mind and the tenor of the covenant unto the poor world; and this did the Prophet foresee long before, when he saith, ""Behold, I will send My messenger, and he shall prepare the way before Me""; speaking of John the Baptist.","""And he shall prepare the way before Me.""","And then He speaketh of Christ to the people, saying, ""And the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple.""",Who is He?,"Even the Messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in, that is Christ.","""Behold, He shall come, saith the LORD of Hosts"" (Mal 3:1).","Now the covenant being made before between the Father and the Son, and Jesus Christ becoming bound to see all the conditions fulfilled, this being done, He could come down from Heaven to earth, to declare to the world what God the Father and HE had concluded on before, and what was the mind of the Father towards the world concerning the salvation of their souls; and indeed, who could better come on such an errand than He that stood by when the covenant was made?",than He that shook hands with the Father in making of the covenant?,"than He that was become a Surety in the behalf of poor sinners, according to the terms of the covenant.","Now, you know, a messenger commonly when he cometh, doth bring some errand to them to whom he is sent, either of what is done for them, or what they would have them whom they send unto do for them, or such like.","Now what a glorious message was that which our Lord Jesus Christ came down from Heaven withal to declare unto poor sinners, and that from God His Father?","I say, how glorious was it; and how sweet is it to you that have seen yourselves lost by nature?","and it will also appear a glorious one to you who are a seeking after Jesus Christ, if you do but consider these following things about what He was sent-- First.",Jesus Christ was sent from Heaven to declare unto the world from God the Father that He was wonderfully filled with love to poor sinners.,"First, in that He would forgive their sins.","Secondly, in that He would save their souls.",Thirdly in that He would make them heirs of His glory.,"""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son.--For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved"" (John 3:16,17).",Second.,"God sent Jesus Christ to tell the poor world how that He would do this for poor sinners, and yet be just, and yet do His justice no wrong; and that was to be done by Jesus Christ's dying of a cursed death in the room of poor sinners, to satisfy justice, and make way for mercy; to take away the stumbling-blocks, and set open Heaven's gates; to overcome Satan, and break off from sinners his chains (Luke 4:18) to set open the prison doors, and to let the prisoners go free (Isa 61:1-3).","And this was the message that Christ was to deliver to the world by commandment from His Father; and this did He tell us when He came of His errand, where he saith, ""I lay down My life for the sheep--no man taketh it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself.","I have power to lay it down, and to take it again.","This commandment have I received of My Father"" (John 10:15-18).","Even this commandment hath My Father given Me, that I should both do this thing and also tell it unto you.",Third.,"He was not only sent as a Messenger to declare this His father's love, but also how dearly He himself loved sinners, what a heart He had to do them good, where He saith, ""All that the Father giveth Me shall come to Me""; and let me tell you, MY heart too, saith Christ--""Him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out"" (John 6:37).","As My Father is willing to give you unto Me, even so am I as willing to receive you.","As My Father is willing to give you Heaven, so am I willing to make you fit for it, by washing you with My own blood; I lay down My life that you might have life; and this I was sent to tell you of My Father.",Fourth.,His message was further; He came to tell them how and which way they should come to enjoy these glorious benefits; also by laying down motives to stir them up to accept of the benefits.,"The way is laid down in John 3:14,15, where Christ saith, ""As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,"" or caused to be hanged on the Cross, and die the death--""that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.""","The way, therefore, that thou shalt have the benefit and comfort of that which My Father and I have covenanted for, for thee, I am come down from Heaven to earth on purpose to give thee intelligence, and to certify thee of it.","Know, therefore, that as I have been born of a woman, and I have taken this Body upon Me, it is on purpose that I might offer it up upon the Cross a sacrifice to God, to give Him satisfaction for thy sins, that His mercy may be extended to thy soul, without any wrong done to justice; and this thou art to believe, and not in the notion but from thy very whole soul.",Now the motives are many.,1.,"If they do not leave their sins, and come to Jesus Christ, that their sins may be washed away by His blood, they are sure to be damned in Hell; for the law hath condemned them already (John 3:18,19).",2.,"But if they do come, they shall have the bosom of Christ to lie in, the Kingdom of Heaven to dwell in, the angels and saints for their companions, shall shine there like the sun, shall be there for ever, shall sit upon the thrones of judgment, etc.",Here is grace.,"Methinks if I had but the time to speak fully to all things that I could speak to from these two heavenly truths, and to make application thereof, surely, with the blessing of God, I think it might persuade some vile and abominable wretch to lay down his arms that he hath taken up in defiance against God, and is marching Hellwards, post-haste with the devil; I say, methinks it should stop them, and make them willing to look back and accept of salvation for their poor condemned souls, before God's eternal vengeance is executed upon them.","O, therefore!","you that are upon this march, I beseech you consider a little.",What!,shall Christ become a drudge for you; and will you be drudges for the devil?,"Shall Christ covenant with God for the salvation of sinners; and shall sinners covenant with Hell, death, and the devil for the damnation of their souls?",Shall Christ come down from Heaven to earth to declare this to sinners; and shall sinners stop their ears against these good tidings?,"Will you not hear the errand of Christ, although He telleth you tidings of peace and salvation?","How, if He had come, having taken a commandment from His Father to damn you, and to send you to the devils in Hell?","Sinner, hear His message; He speaketh no harm, His words are Eternal Life; all men that give ear unto them, they have eternal advantage by them; advantage, I say, that never hath an end.","Besides, do but consider these two things, it is like they have some sway upon thy soul--1.","When He came on His message, He came with tears in His eyes, and did even weepingly tender the terms of reconciliation to them; I say, with tears in his eyes.","And when He came near the city--i.e., with His message of peace--beholding the hardness of their hearts, He wept over it, and took up a lamentation over it; because He saw they rejected His mercy, which was tidings of peace; I say, wilt thou then slight a weeping Jesus, One that so loveth thy soul that, rather than He will lose thee, He will with tears persuade with thee?",2.,"Not only so, but also when He came, He came all on a gore blood to proffer mercy to thee, to show thee still how dearly He did love thee; as if He had said, Sinner, here is mercy for thee; but behold My bloody sweat, My bloody wounds, My cursed death; behold and see what danger I have gone through to come unto thy soul; I am come indeed unto thee, and do bring thee tidings of salvation, but it cost Me My heart's blood before I could come at thee, to give thee the fruits of My everlasting love.",But more of this anon.,"Thus have I spoken something concerning Christ's being the Messenger of the new covenant; but because I am not willing to cut too short of what shall come after, I shall pass by these things not half touched, and come to the other which I promised even now; which was to show you, that as there were Levitical ceremonies in or belonging to the first covenant, so these types, or Levitical ceremonies, did represent the glorious things of the new covenant.","In those ceremonies you read of a sacrifice, of a priest to offer up the sacrifice, the place where, and the manner how, he was to offer it; of which I shall speak something.",Christ the sacrifice of the new covenant.,THIRD.,"[A third office of Christ, in reference to the new covenant, was His becoming the sacrifice].","As touching the sacrifice; you find that it was not to be offered up of all kind of beasts, as of lions, bears, wolves, tigers, dragons, serpents, or such like; to signify, that not all kind of creatures that had sinned, as devils, the fallen angels, should be saved; but the sacrifice was to be taken out of some kind of beasts and birds, to signify, that some of God's creatures that had sinned He would be pleased to reconcile them to Himself again; as poor fallen man and woman, those miserable creatures, God, the God of Heaven, had a good look for after their fall; but not for the cruel devils, though more noble creatures by creation than we.",Here is grace.,"Now though these sacrifices were offered, yet they were not offered to the end they should make the comers to, or offerers thereof, perfect; but the things were to represent to the world what God had in after ages for to do, which was even the salvation of His creatures by that offering of the body of Jesus Christ, of which these were a shadow and a type for the accomplishing of the second covenant.","For Christ was by covenant to offer a sacrifice, and that an effectual one too, if He intended the salvation of sinners--""A body hast Thou prepared for Me; I am come to do Thy will"" (Heb 10:5).","I shall therefore show you, First.","What was expected by God in the sacrifice in the type, and then show you how it was answered in the antitype.",Second.,"I shall show you the manner of the offering of the type, and so answerable thereto to show you the fitness of the sacrifice of the body of Christ, by way of answering some questions.",First.,"For the first of these, [What was expected by God in the sacrifice in the type, and how answered in the antitype]--1.","God did expect that sacrifice which He Himself had appointed, and not another, to signify, that none would serve His turn but the body and soul of His appointed Christ, the Mediator of the new covenant (John 1:29).",2.,"This sacrifice must not be lame nor deformed; it must have no scar, spot, or blemish; to signify, that Jesus Christ was to be a complete sacrifice by covenant (1 Peter 1:19).",3.,"This sacrifice was to be taken out of the flock or herd; to signify, that Jesus Christ was to come out of the race of mankind, according to covenant (Heb 10:5).","But, Second.","As to the manner of it [The offering of the types, and so answerable thereto, to show the fitness of the sacrifice of the body of Christ]--1.","The sacrifice, before it was offered, was to have all the sins of the children of Israel confessed over it; to signify, that Jesus Christ must bear the sins of all His children by covenant (Isa 53:4-7; 1 Peter 2:24).","""As for Thee also, by the blood of Thy covenant,"" in His own body on the tree (Zech 9:11).",2.,"It must be had to the place appointed--namely, without the camp of Israel; to signify, that Jesus Christ must be led to the Mount Calvary (Luke 23:33).",3.,"The sacrifice was to be killed there; to signify, that Jesus Christ must and did suffer without the city of Jerusalem for our salvation.",4.,"The sacrifice must not only have its life taken away, but also some of its flesh burned upon the altar; to signify, that Jesus Christ was not only to die a natural death, but also that He should undergo the pains and torments of the damned in Hell.",5.,"Sometimes there must be a living offering and a dead offering, as the goat that was killed, and the scape-goat, the dead bird and the living bird, to signify, that Jesus Christ must die, and come to life again (Lev 19:4-6).",6.,"The goat that was to die was to be the sin-offering; that is, to be offered as the rest of the sin-offerings, to make an atonement as a type; and the other goat was to have all the sins of the children of Israel confessed over him, and then let go into the wilderness, never to be catched again (Lev 16:7-22).","To signify, that Christ's death was to make satisfaction for sin, and His coming to life again was to bring in everlasting justification from the power, curse, and destroying nature of sin (Rom 4:25).",7.,"The scape-goat was to be carried by a fit man into the wilderness; to signify that Jesus Christ should both be fit and able to carry our sins quite a way from us, so as they should never be laid to our charge again.",Here is grace.,8.,"The sacrifices under the law, commonly part of them must be eaten; to signify, that they that are saved should spiritually feed on the body and blood of Jesus Christ, or else they have no life by Him (Exo 12:5-11; John 6:51-53).",9.,"This sacrifice must be eaten with unleavened bread; to signify, that they which love their sins, that devilish leaven of wickedness, they do not feed upon Jesus Christ.","8 Now of what hath been spoken this is the sum, that there is a sacrifice under the new covenant, as there were sacrifices under the old; and that this sacrifice did every way answer that, or those; indeed, they did but suffer for sin in show, but He in reality; they are the shadow, but He as the substance.",O!,"when Jesus Christ did come to make Himself a sacrifice, or to offer Himself for sin, you may understand that our sins were indeed charged to purpose upon Him.",O!,"how they scarred his soul, how they brake His body, insomuch that they made the blood run down His blessed face and from His precious side; therefore thou must understand these following things--First, that Jesus Christ by covenant did die for sin.","Secondly, that His death was not a mere natural death, but a ""cursed death,"" even such an one as men do undergo from God for their sins, though He Himself had none, even such a death as to endure the very pains and torments of Hell.",O sad pains and inexpressible torments that this our Sacrifice for sin went under!,"The pains of His body were not all; no, but the pains of His soul; for His soul was made an offering as well as His body, yet all but one sacrifice (Isa 53).","[As Christ did not suffer in His body without suffering in soul, nor yet in soul without His suffering in body; it was because not the body without the soul, but both the body and soul of the saints should be for ever saved].","To signify, that the suffering of Christ was not only a bodily suffering, but a soul suffering; not only to suffer what man could inflict upon Him, but also to suffer soul torments that none but God can inflict, or suffer to be inflicted upon Him.","O, the torments of His soul!",they were the torments indeed; His soul was that that felt the wrath of God.,"""My soul,"" saith He, ""is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death"" (Matt 26:38).","""Now is My soul troubled, and what shall I say?""",(John 12:27).,The rock was not so rent as was His precious soul;

the conditions upon which He died did call for the torments of Hell; for Christ did not die the death of a saint, but the death of a sinner, of a cursed and damned sinner; because He stood in their room, the law to which He was subjected called for the torments of Hell; the nature of God's justice could not bate Him anything; the death which He was to suffer had not lost its sting; all these being put together do irresistibly declare unto us that He, as a sacrifice, did suffer the torments of Hell (Gal 3:13).","But, 2.","Had He not died and suffered the cursed death, the covenant had been made void, and His Suretyship would have been forfeited, and, besides this, the world damned in the flames of Hell-fire;

and it may be it is, because they have not thought on this so well as they should--namely, that as He was a sacrifice He was passive, that is, led or had away as a lamb to His sufferings (Isaiah 53); but as a priest He was active--that is, He did willingly and freely give up His Body to be a sacrifice.","""He hath given His life a ransom for many.""","This consideration being with some weight and clearness on my spirit, I was and am caused to lay them down in two particular heads.","And therefore I would speak something to is this, that as there were priests under the first covenant, so there is a Priest under this, belonging to this new covenant, a High Priest, the Chief Priest; as it is clear where it is said, We ""having a high priest over the house of God"" (Heb 3:1; 5:5,10; 7:24-26; 8:1, 4; 10:21).","Now the things that I shall treat upon are these--First, I shall show you the qualifications required of a priest under the Law; Second, his office; and, Third, how Jesus Christ did according to what was signified by those under the law; I say, how He did answer the types, and where He went beyond them.","First, For his qualifications:-- 1.","They must be called thereto of God--""No man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as Aaron"" (Heb 5:4).","Now Aaron's being called of God to be a priest signifies that Jesus Christ is a Priest of God's appointment, such an one that God hath chosen, likes of, and hath set on work--""Called of God an High Priest,"" etc.",(Heb 5:10).,2.,"The priests under the law they must be men, complete, not deformed--""Speak unto Aaron,"" saith God to Moses, ""saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.","For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach; a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous, or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed, or crook-backt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; no man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire; he that hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God"" (Lev 21:17-21).","What doth all this signify but that, (1.)","He must not be lame, to signify he must not go haltingly about the work of our salvation.",(2.),"He must not be blind, to signify that he must not go ignorantly to work, but he must be quick of understanding in the things of God.",(3.),"He must not be scabbed, to signify that the priest must not be corrupt of filthy in his office.",(4.),"In a word, he must be every way complete, to signify to us that Jesus Christ was to be, and is, most complete and most perfect in things pertaining to God in reference to His second covenant.",3.,"The priests under the law were not to be hard-hearted, but pitiful and compassionate, willing and ready, with abundance of bowels, to offer for the people, and to make an atonement for them (Heb 5:1,2).","To signify, that Jesus Christ should be a tender-hearted High Priest, able and willing to sympathize and be affected with the infirmities of others, to pray for them, to offer up for them His precious blood; He must be such an One who can have compassion on a company of poor ignorant souls, and on them that are out of the way, to recover them, and to set them in safety (Heb 4:15).","And that He might thus do, He must be a man that had experience of the disadvantages that infirmity and sin did bring unto those poor creatures (Heb 2:17).",4.,"The high priests under the law were not to be shy or squeamish in case there were any that had the plague or leprosy, scab or blotches; but must look on them, go to them, and offer for them (Lev 13), all which is to signify, that Jesus Christ should not refuse to take notice of the several infirmities of the poorest people, but to teach them, and to see that none of them be lost by reason of their infirmity, for want of looking to or tending of.",10 This privilege also have we under this second covenant.,This is the way to make grace shine.,5.,"The high priests under the law they were to be anointed with very excellent oil, compounded by art (Exo 29:7;

and in his garment and glorious ornaments there must be precious stones, and on those stones there must be written the names of the children of Israel (read Exodus 28), and all this was to signify what a glorious High Priest Jesus Christ should be, and how in the righteousness of God He should appear before God as our High Priest, to offer up the sacrifice that was to be offered for our salvation to God His Father.",But I pass that.,"Second, Now I shall speak to His office.",The office of the high priest in general was twofold.,1.,To offer the sacrifice without the camp.,2.,"To bring it within the veil--that is, into the holiest of all, which did type out Heaven.",1.,[First part of the high priest's office].,(1.),It was the office of the priest to offer the sacrifice; and so did Jesus Christ; He did offer His own Body and Soul in sacrifice.,"I say, HE did OFFER it, and not another, as it is written, ""No man taketh away My life, but I lay it down of Myself; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again"" (John 10:17,18).","And again it is said, ""When He,"" Jesus, ""had offered up one sacrifice for sin, for ever sat down on the right hand of God"" (Heb 10:12).",(2.),"The priests under the law must offer up the sacrifice that God had appointed, and none else, a complete one without any blemish; and so did our High Priest, where He saith, ""Sacrifice and offering Thou wouldest not, but a body has Thou prepared Me,"" and that I will offer (Heb 10:5).",(3.),"The priest was to take of the ashes of the sacrifice, and lay them in a clean place; and this signifies, that the Body of Jesus, after it had been offered, should be laid into Joseph's sepulchre, as in a clean place, where never any man before was laid (Lev 6:11, compared with John 19:41,42).",2.,[Second part of the high priest's office].,"This being one part of his office, and when this was done, then in the next place he was, (1.)","To put on the glorious garment, when he was to go into the holiest, and take of the blood, and carry it thither, etc., he was to put on the holy garment which signifieth the righteousness of Jesus Christ.",(2.),"He was in this holy garment, which hath in it the stones, and in the stones the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel, to appear in the holy place.","""And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel: six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of the rest on the other stone, according to their birth"" (Exo 28:9,10).","And this was to signify, that Jesus Christ was to enter into the holiest, then He was there to bear the names of His elect in the tables of His heart before the Throne of God and the Mercy-seat (Heb 12:23).",(3.),"With this he was to take of the blood of the sacrifices, and carry it into the holiest of all, which was a type of Heaven, and there was he to sprinkle the mercy-seat; and this was to be done by the high priest only; to signify, that none but Jesus Christ must have this office and privilege, to be the people's High Priest to offer for them.","""But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people"" (Heb 9:7).",(4.),"He was there to make an atonement for the people with the blood, sprinkling of it upon the mercy-seat; but this must be done with much incense.","""And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself: and he shall take a censor full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil: and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord, that he cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not: and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat eastward, and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.","Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat.""",(Lev 16:11-15).,"Now this was for the priest and the people; all which doth signify that Jesus Christ was after His death to go into Heaven itself, of which this holy place was a figure, and there to carry the sacrifice that He offered upon the Cross into the presence of God, to obtain mercy for the people in a way of justice (Heb 9).","And in that he is said to take his hands full of sweet incense, it signifies that Jesus Christ was to offer up His sacrifice in the presence of His Father in a way of intercession and prayers.","I might have branched these things out into several particulars, but I would be brief.","I say, therefore, the office of the priest was to carry the blood into the holy place, and there to present it before the mercy-seat, with his heart full of intercessions for the people for whom he was a priest (Luke 1:8-11).","This is Jesus Christ's work now in the Kingdom of Glory, to plead His own blood, the nature and virtue of it, with a perpetual intercession to the God of Mercy on behalf of us poor miserable sinners (Heb 7:25).",[Comfortable considerations from Christ's intercession].,"Now, in the intercession of this Jesus, which is part of His priestly office, there are these things to be considered for our comfort-- 1.","There is a pleading of the virtue of His Blood for them that are already come in, that they may be kept from the evils of heresies, delusions, temptations, pleasures, profits, or anything of this world which may be too hard for them.","""Father, I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world,"" saith Christ, ""but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil"" (John 17:15).",2.,"In case the devil should aspire up into the presence of God, to accuse any of the poor saints, and to plead their backslidings against them, as he will do if he can, then there is Jesus, our Lord Jesus, ready in the Court of Heaven, at the right hand of God, to plead the virtue of His Blood, not only for the great and general satisfaction that He did give when He was on the Cross, but also the virtue that is in it now for the cleansing and fresh purging of His poor saints under their several temptations and infirmities; as saith the Apostle, ""For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life""--that is, by His intercession (Rom 5:10).",3.,"The maintaining of grace, also, is by Jesus Christ's intercession, being the second part of His priestly office.","O, had we not a Jesus at the right hand of God making intercession for us, and to convey fresh supplies of grace unto us through the virtue of His Blood being pleaded at God's right hand, how soon would it be with us as it is with those for whom He prays not at all (John 17:9)?","But the reason why thou standest while others fall, the reason why thou goest through the many temptations of the world, and shakest them off from thee, while others are ensnared and entangled therein, it is because thou hast an interceding Jesus.","""I have prayed,"" saith He, ""that thy faith fail not"" (Luke 22:32).",4.,It is partly by the virtue of Christ's intercession that the elect are brought in.,"There are many that are to come to Christ which are not yet brought in to Christ: and it is one part of His work to pray for their salvation too--""Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe,"" though as yet they do not believe ""on Me,"" but that they may believe ""through their word"" (John 17:20).","And let me tell thee, soul, for thy comfort, who art a-coming to Christ, panting and sighing, as if thy heart would break, I tell thee, soul, thou wouldst never have come to Christ, if He had not first, by the virtue of His blood and intercession, sent into thy heart an earnest desire after Christ; and let me tell thee also, that it is His business to make intercession for thee, not only that thou mightest come in, but that thou mightest be preserved when thou art come in (Compare Heb 7:25; Rom 8:33-39).",5.,It is by the intercession of Christ that the infirmities of the saints in their holy duties are forgiven.,"Alas, if it were not for the priestly office of Christ Jesus, the prayers, alms, and other duties of the saints might be rejected, because of the sin that is in them; but Jesus being our High Priest, He is ready to take away the iniquities of our holy things, perfuming our prayers with the glory of His own perfections; and therefore it is that there is an answer given to the saints' prayers, and also acceptance of their holy duties (Rev 8:3,4).","""But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;

and many more without question might be mentioned, but I forbear.",Christ the forerunner of the saints.,FIFTH.,"A fifth office of Christ in reference to the second covenant was, that He should be the forerunner to Heaven before His saints that were to follow after.","First, He strikes hands in the covenant, [and then] He stands bound as a Surety to see everything in the covenant accomplished that was to be done on His part; [next] He brings the message from Heaven to the world; and before He goeth back, He offereth Himself for the same sins that He agreed to suffer for; and so soon as this was done, He goeth post-haste to Heaven again, not only to exercise the second part of His priestly office, but as our forerunner, to take possession for us, even into Heaven itself, as you may see, where it is said, ""Whither the Forerunner is for us entered"" (Heb 6:20).",First.,"He is run before to open Heaven's gates--Be ye open, ye everlasting doors, that the King of Glory may enter in.",Second.,He is run before us to take possession of glory in our natures for us.,Third.,"He is run before to prepare us our places against we come after--""I go to prepare a place for you"" (John 14:1-3).",Fourth.,"He is run thither to make the way easy, in that He hath first trodden the path Himself.",Fifth.,He is run thither to receive gifts for us.,"All spiritual and heavenly gifts had been kept from us had not Christ, so soon as the time appointed was come, run back to the Kingdom of Glory to receive them for us.","But I cannot stand to enlarge upon these glorious things, the Lord enlarge them upon your hearts by meditation.",[These things have I spoken to show you that saints are under grace.],Christ completely fulfilled the conditions of the new covenant.,"Here now I might begin to speak of His prophetical and kingly office, and the privileges that do and shall come thereby, but that I fear I shall be too tedious, therefore at this time I shall pass them by.","Thus you may see how the Covenant of Grace doth run, and with Whom it was made, and also what were the conditions thereof.","Now, then, this grace, this everlasting grace of God, comes to be free to us through the satisfaction, according to the conditions, given by Another for us; for though it be free, and freely given to us, yet the obtaining of it did cost our Head, our public Man, a very dear price.","""For ye are bought with a price,"" even with the precious blood of Christ.","So it is by Another, I say, not by us; yet it is as surely made over to us, even to so many of us as do or shall believe, as if we had done it, and obtained the grace of God ourselves (1 Cor 6:20; 1 Peter 1:9).","Nay, surer; for consider, I say, this grace is free to us, and comes upon a clear score, by virtue of the labour and purchase of Another for us; mark, that which is obtained by Another for us is not obtained for us by ourselves--No, but Christ hath, not by the blood of goats and calves, ""obtained eternal redemption for us,"" which were things offered by men under the law, ""but by His own blood,"" meaning Christ's, ""He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us"" (Heb 9:12).","It comes to be unchangeable through the perfection of that satisfaction that was given to God through the Son of Mary for us; for whatever the Divine, infinite, and eternal justice of God did call for at the hands of man, if ever he intended to be a partaker of the grace of God, this Jesus, this one Man, this public Person, did, did completely give a satisfaction to it, even so effectually; which caused God not only to say, I am pleased, but ""I am well pleased""; completely and sufficiently satisfied with Thee on their behalf; for so you must understand it (Matt 3:17).","Mark therefore these following words--""And, having made peace,"" or completely made up the difference, ""through the blood of His cross, by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself;

because it was obtained, yea, completely obtained, for us, by Jesus Christ, God-man.",Object.,"But some may say, How was it possible that one man Jesus, by one offering, should so completely obtain and bring in unchangeable grace for such an innumerable company of sinners as are to be saved?",Answ.,First.,In that He was every way fitted for such a work.,"And, Second.","In that, as I said before, He did every way completely satisfy that which was offended by our disobedience to the former covenant.",[First.,He was every way fitted for such a work].,"And, for the clearing of this, 1.","Consider, was it man that had offended?","He was Man that gave the satisfaction--""For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead"" (1 Cor 15:21).",2.,Was it God that was offended?,"He was God that did give a satisfaction--""Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given.--and His name shall be called The mighty God"" (Isa 9:6).","""He thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but,"" for our sakes, He ""made Himself of no reputation,"" etc.",(Phil 2:6-7).,3.,"For the further clearing of this, to show you that in everything He was rightly qualified for this great work, see what God Himself saith of Him;

fellow in His power and strength; fellow in His wisdom; fellow in His mercy and grace; together with the rest of the attributes of God; so that, I say, let justice turn itself which way it will, here is a complete Person to give a complete satisfaction (Prov 8:23;

Luke 24:34).",10.,"Must He carry that body into the presence of His Father, to take possession of Heaven, and must He appear there as a priest, as a forerunner, as an advocate, as prophet, as a treasure-house, as an interceder and pleader of the causes of His people?","He will be all these, and much more, to the end the grace of God by faith in Jesus Christ might be made sure to all the seed.","""Who then can condemn?","It is God that justifieth; because Christ hath died, yea rather, that is risen again.""","Who, now seeing all this is so effectually done, shall lay anything, the least thing?","who can find the least flaw, the least wrinkle, the least defect or imperfection, in this glorious satisfaction (Rom 8:33-34; Heb 6:20; 9:24; John 14:2,3; 1 John 2:1)?",Object.,"But is it possible that He should so soon give infinite justice a satisfaction, a complete satisfaction?","for the eternal God doth require an eternal lying under the curse, to the end He may be eternally satisfied.",Answ.,"Indeed, that which is infinite must have an eternity to satisfy God in--that is, they that fall into the prison and pit of utter darkness must be there to all eternity, to the end the justice of God may have its full blow at them.","But now He that I am speaking of is God, and so is infinite (Isa 9:6; Titus 1:16,17; Heb 1:8,9; Phil 2:4-6).","Now, He which is true God is able to give in as little a time an infinite satisfaction as Adam was in giving the dissatisfaction.","Adam himself might have given satisfaction for himself as soon as Christ had he been very God, as Jesus Christ was.","For the reason why the posterity of Adam, even so many of them as fall short of life, must lie broiling in Hell to all eternity is this--they are not able to give the justice of God satisfaction, they being not infinite, as aforesaid.","""But Christ,"" that is, God-man, ""being come an High Priest,"" that is, to offer and give satisfaction, ""of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own,""--mark you that, ""but by His own blood He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.""",But how?,"""For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit,"" who through the power and virtue of His infinite Godhead, ""offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?","And for this cause,"" that is, for that He is God as well as man, and so able to give justice an infinite satisfaction, therefore, ""He is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance"" (Heb 9:11-15).",As I said before.,Object.,This is much; but is God connected with this?,Is He satisfied now in the behalf of sinners by this Man's thus suffering?,"If He is, then how doth it appear?",Answ.,"It is evident, yea, wonderful evident, that this hath pleased Him to the full, as appeareth by these following demonstrations.-- First.","In that God did admit Him into His presence; yea, receive Him with joy and music, even with the sound of the trumpet, at His ascension into Heaven (Psa 47:5).","And Christ makes it an argument to His children that His righteousness was sufficient, in that He went to His Father, and they saw Him no more, ""of righteousness,"" saith He, ""because I go to My Father, and ye see Me no more"" (John 16:10).","As if He had said, My Spirit shall show to the world that I have brought in a sufficient righteousness to justify sinners withal, in that when I go to appear in the presence of My Father on their behalf, He shall give Me entertainment, and not throw Me down from Heaven, because I did not do it sufficiently.","Again; if you consider the high esteem that God the Father doth set on the death of His Son, you will find that He hath received good content thereby.","When the Lord Jesus, by way of complaint, told His Father that He and His merits were not valued to the worth, His Father answered, It is a light thing that I should give Thee, O My Servant, to bring Jacob again; ""I will also give Thee for a light to the Gentiles, that Thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth"" (Isa 49:6).","As if the Lord had said, ""My Son, I do value Thy death at a higher rate than that Thou shouldst save the tribes of Israel only; behold the Gentiles, the barbarous heathens, they also shall be brought in as the price of Thy blood.","It is a light thing that Thou shouldest be My Servant only to bring, or redeem, the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give Thee for a light to the Gentiles, that Thou mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth.""",12 Again; you may see it also by the carriage of God the Father to all the great sinners to whom mercy was proffered.,We do not find that God maketh any objection against them to come to Him for the pardon of their sins; because He did want a satisfaction suitable to the greatness of their sins.,"There was Manasseh, who was one that burned his children in the fire to the devil, that used witchcraft, that used to worship the host of heaven, that turned his back on the Word that God sent unto him; nay, that did worse than the very heathen that God cast out before the children of Israel (2 Chron 33:1-13).","Also those that are spoken of in the Nineteenth of Acts, that did spend so much time in conjuration, and the like, for such I judge they were, that when they came to burn their books, they counted the price thereof to be fifty thousand pieces of silver (Acts 19:19).","Simon Magus also, that was a sorcerer, and bewitched the whole city, yet he had mercy proffered to him once and again (Acts 8).","I say, it was not the greatness of the sins of these sinners; no, nor of an innumerable company of others, that made God at all to object against the salvation of their souls, which justice would have constrained Him to had He not had satisfaction sufficient by the blood of the Lord Jesus.","Nay, further, I do find that because God the Father would not have the merits of His Son to be undervalued, I say, He doth therefore freely by His consent let mercy be proffered to the greatest sinners--in the first place, for the Jews, that were the worst of men in that day for blasphemy against the Gospel; yet the Apostle proffered mercy to them in the first place--""It was necessary,"" saith he, ""that the Word of God should first have been spoken to you"" (Acts 3:26; 13:46).","And Christ gave them commission so to do; for, saith He, Let repentance and remission of sins be preached in My name among all nations, and begin--mark that, ""beginning at Jerusalem"" (Luke 24:47), Let them that but the other day had their hands up to the elbows in My heart's blood have the first proffer of My mercy.","And, saith Paul, ""For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on Him to life everlasting"" (1 Tim 1:16).","As the Apostle saith, those sinners that were dead, possessed with the devil, and the children of wrath, He hath quickened, delivered, and saved.","That He might, even in the very ""ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us,"" and that ""through Christ Jesus"" (Eph 2:7).",Second.,"It is evident that that which this Man did as a common person He did it completely and satisfactorily, as appears by the openness, as I may so call it, which was in the heart of God to Him at His resurrection and ascension--""Ask of Me,"" saith He, ""and I shall give Thee the"" very ""heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession"" (Psa 2:8).",And this was at His resurrection (Acts 13:33).,"Whereas, though He had asked, yet if He had not given a full and complete satisfaction, justice would not have given Him any thing; for justice, the justice of God, is so pure, that if it be not completely satisfied in every particular, it giveth nothing but curses (Gal 3:10).",Third.,"It is yet far more evident that He hath indeed pleased God in the behalf of sinners, in that God hath given Him gifts to distribute to sinners, yea, the worst of sinners, as a fruit of His satisfaction, and that at His ascension (Psa 68:18).","Christ hath so satisfied God, that He hath given Him all the treasures both of Heaven and earth to dispose of as He seeth good; He hath so pleased God, that He hath given Him a name above every name, a sceptre above every sceptre, a crown above every crown, a kingdom above every kingdom; He hath given Him the highest place in Heaven, even His own right hand; He hath given Him all the power of Heaven and earth, and under the earth, in His own hand, to bind whom He pleaseth, and to set free whom He thinks meet; He hath, in a word, such a high esteem in the eyes of His Father, that He hath put into His hands all things that are for the profit of His people, both in this world and that which is to come; and all this as the fruit of His faithfulness in doing of His work, as the Mediator of the new covenant (Phil 2:9; Rev 19:6).","Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captivity captive, Thou hast received gifts--mark, Thou hast received them--for men, even for the worst of men, for the rebellious also; and hath sent forth some, being furnished with these gifts; some, I say, for the work of the ministry, to the edifying of them that are already called, and also for the calling in of all those for whom He covenanted with His Father, till all come in the unity of faith, etc.",(Eph 4:8-13).,Fourth.,"It doth still appear yet far more evident; for will you hear what the Father Himself saith for the showing of His well-pleasedness in these two particulars--First, in that He bids poor souls to hear and to do as Christ would have them (Matt 3:17; Luke 9:35).","Secondly, in that He resolves to make them that turn their backs upon Him, that dishonour Him, which is done in a very great measure by those that lay aside His merits done by Himself for justification; I say, He that resolved to make this His footstool, where He saith, ""Sit Thou at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool"" (Psa 110:1).",Are they enemies to Thee?,saith God.,I will be even with them.,Do they slight Thy merits?,"Do they slight Thy groans, Thy tears, Thy blood, Thy death, Thy resurrection and intercession, Thy second coming again in heavenly glory?",I will tear them and rend them; I will make them as mire in the streets; I will make Thy enemies Thy footstool (Matt 22:44; Heb 1:13; 10:13).,"Ay, saith He, and ""Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel"" (Psa 2:9).",Look to it you that slight the merits of the blood of Christ.,Fifth.,"Again further; yet God will make all the world to know that He hath been and is well pleased in His Son, in that God hath given, and will make it appear He hath given, the world to come into His hand; and that He shall raise the dead, bring them before His judgment-seat, execute judgment upon them, which He pleaseth to execute judgment on to their damnation; and to receive them to eternal life whom He doth favour, even so many as shall be found to believe in His name and merits (Heb 2).","""For as the Father hath life in Himself; so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself; and hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man.","For the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation"" (John 5:26-29).","Ay, and the worst enemy that Christ hath now shall come at that day with a pale face, with a quaking heart, and bended knees, trembling before Him, confessing the glory of His merits, and the virtue there was in them to save, ""to the glory of God the Father"" (Rom 14:11; Phil 2:11).","Much more might be added to discover the glorious perfection of this Man's satisfaction; but for you that desire to be further satisfied concerning this, search the Scriptures, and beg of God to give you faith and understanding therein; and as for you that slight these things, and continue so doing, God hath another way to take with you, even to dash you in pieces like a potter's vessel; for this hath Christ received of His Father to do unto you (Rev 2:27).","Thus I have showed you in particular, that the Covenant of Grace of God is free and unchangeable to men--that is, in that it hath been obtained for men, and that perfectly, to the satisfying of justice, and taking all things out of the way that were any ways a hindrance to our salvation (Col 2:14).",The Covenant of Grace unchangeable; the opposers answered.,The second thing for the discovering of this freeness and constancy of the Covenant of Grace of God is manifested thus-- First.,"Whatsoever any man hath of the grace of God, he hath it as a free gift of God through Christ Jesus the Mediator of this covenant, even when they are in a state of enmity to Him, whether it be Christ as the foundation-stone, or faith to lay hold of Him, mark that (Rom 5:8,9; Col 1:21,22).","""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves,"" not for anything in you, or done by you for the purchasing of it, but ""it is the gift of God,"" (Eph 2:8) and that bestowed on you, even when ye ""were dead in trespasses and sins"" (Eph 2:1,9).","Nay, if thou hast so much as one desire that is right, it is the gift of God; for of ourselves, saith the Apostle, we are not able to speak a good word, or think a good thought (2 Cor 3:5).","Was it not grace, absolute grace, that God made promise to Adam after transgression?",(Gen 3:15).,"Was it not free grace in God to save such a wretch as Manasseh was, who used enchantments, witchcraft, burnt his children in the fire, and wrought much evil?",(2 Chron 33).,"Was it not free grace to save such as those were that are spoken of in the 16th of Ezekiel, which no eye pitied?","Was it not free grace for Christ to give Peter a loving look after he had cursed, and swore, and denied Him?","Was it not free grace that met Paul when he was agoing to Damascus to persecute, which converted him, and made him a vessel of mercy?","And what shall I say of such that are spoken of in 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10, speaking there of fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, abusers of themselves with mankind, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, extortioners, the basest of sinners in the world, and yet were washed, and yet were justified; was it not freely by grace?","O saints, you that are in heaven cry out, ""We came hither by grace; and you that are on the earth, I am sure you cry, If ever we do go thither, it must be freely by grace!""",Second.,"In the next place, it appears to be unchangeable in this--1.",Because justice being once satisfied doth not use to call for the debt again.,"No; let never such a sinner come to Jesus Christ, and so to God by Him, and justice, instead of speaking against the salvation of that sinner, it will say, I am just as well as faithful to forgive him his sins (1 John 1:9).","When justice itself is pleased with a man, and speaks on his side, instead of speaking against him, we may well cry out, Who shall condemn?",2.,"Because there is no law to come in against the sinner that believes in Jesus Christ; for he is not under that, and that by right comes in against none but those that are under it.","But believers are not under that--that is, not their Lord, therefore that hath nothing to do with them; and besides, Christ's blood hath not only taken away the curse thereof, but also He hath in His own Person completely fulfilled it as a public Person in our stead.",(Rom 7:1-4).,3.,"The devil that accused them is destroyed (Heb 2:14,15).",4.,"Death, and the grave, and Hell are overcome (1 Cor 15:55; Hosea 13:14).",5.,"Sin, that great enemy of man's salvation, that is washed away (Rev 1:5).",6.,"The righteousness of God is put upon them that believe, and given to them, and they are found in it (Phil 3:8-10; Rom 3:22).",7.,"Christ is always in Heaven to plead for them, and to prepare a place for them (Heb 7:24; John 14:1-4).",8.,"He hath not only promised that He will not leave us, nor forsake us, but He hath also sworn to fulfill His promises.",O rich grace!,O free grace!,"Lord, who desired Thee to promise?",who compelled Thee to swear?,"We use to take honest men upon their bare word, but God, ""willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel,"" hath ""confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things,"" His promise and His oath, ""in which it was impossible for God to lie,"" or break either of them, ""we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us"" (Heb 6:17-18).","I will warrant you, God will never break His oath; therefore we may well have good ground to hope from such a good foundation as this, that God will never leave us indeed.",Amen.,Third.,"Not only thus, but, 1.","God hath begotten believers again to Himself, to be His adopted and accepted children, in and through the Lord Jesus (1 Peter 1:3).",2.,"God hath prepared a kingdom for them before the foundation of the world, through Jesus Christ (Matt 25:34).",3.,He hath given them an earnest of their happiness while they live here in this world.,"""After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory,"" and that through this Jesus (Eph 1:13,14).",[These things are more fully laid down in that part of the book which containeth the discourse of the privileges of the new covenant].,4.,"If His children sin through weakness, or by sudden temptation, they confessing of it, He willingly forgives, and heals all their wounds, reneweth His love towards them, waits to do them good, casteth their sins into the depths of the sea, and all this freely, without any work done by men as men--Not for your own sakes do I do this, O house of Israel, be it known unto you, saith the Lord, but wholly and alone by the blood of Jesus (Eze 36:23,23).",5.,"In a word, if you would see it altogether, God's love was the cause why Jesus Christ was sent to bleed for sinners.","Jesus Christ's bleeding stops the cries of Divine justice; God looks upon them as complete in Him, gives them to Him as His by right of purchase.",Jesus ever lives to pray for them that are thus given unto Him.,"God sends His Holy Spirit into them to reveal this to them, sends His angels to minister for them; and all this by virtue of an Everlasting Covenant between the Father and the Son.",Thrice happy are the people that are in such a case!,"Nay, further, He hath made them brethren with Jesus Christ, members of His flesh and of His bones, the spouse of this Lord Jesus; and all to show you how dearly, how really, how constantly He loveth us, who, by faith of His operation, have laid hold upon Him.",[These things I might have treated upon more largely].,[Further Arguments and Objections answered].,"I shall now lay down a few arguments for the superabundant clearing of it, and afterwards answer two or three objections that may be made against it, and so I shall fall upon the next thing.",First.,God loves the saints as He loves Jesus Christ; and God loves Jesus Christ with an eternal love; therefore the saints also with the same.,"""Thou hast loved them as Thou has loved Me"" (John 17:23).",Second.,"That love which is God Himself, must needs be everlasting love; and that is the love wherewith God hath loved His saints in Christ Jesus; therefore His love towards His children in Christ must needs be an everlasting love.","There is none dare say that the love of God is mixed with a created mixture; if not, then it must needs be Himself (1 John 4:16).",[You must not understand that love in God is a passion as it is in us; but the love of God is the very essence or nature of God].,Third.,"That love which is always pitched upon us, in an object as holy as God, must needs be an everlasting love.","Now the love of God was and is pitched upon us, through an object as holy as God Himself, even our Lord Jesus; therefore it must needs be unchangeable.",Fourth.,"If He with whom the Covenant of Grace was made, did in every thing and condition do even what the Lord could desire or require of Him, that His love might be extended to us, and that for ever, then His love must needs be an everlasting love, seeing everything required of us was completely accomplished for us by Him; and all this hath our Lord Jesus done, and that most gloriously, even on our behalf; therefore it must needs be a love that lasts for ever and ever.",Fifth.,"If God hath declared Himself to be the God that changeth not, and hath sworn to be immutable in His promise, then surely He will be unchangeable; and He hath done so; therefore it is impossible for God to lie, and so for His eternal love to be changeable (Heb 6:13-18).",Here is an argument of the Spirit's own making!,Who can contradict it?,"If any object, and say, But still it is upon the condition of believing--I answer, The condition also is His own free gift, and not a qualification arising from the stock of nature (Eph 2:8; Phil 1:28,29).","So that here is the love unchangeable; here is also the condition given by Him whose love is unchangeable, which may serve yet further for a strong argument that God will have His love unchangeable.","Sinner, this is better felt and enjoyed than talked of.",Objection First.,"But if this love of God be unchangeable in itself, yet it is not unchangeably set upon the saints unless they behave themselves the better.",[The first objection].,Answ.,"As God's love at the first was bestowed upon the saints without anything foreseen by the Lord in them, as done by them, Deuteronomy 9:4-6, so He goeth on with the same, Saying, ""I will never leave thee nor forsake thee"" (Heb 13:5).",Objection Second.,"But how cometh it to pass then, that many fall off again from the grace of the Gospel, after a profession of it for some time; some to delusions, and some to their own sins again?",[The second objection].,Answ.,"They are all fallen away, not from the everlasting love of God to them, but from the profession of the love of God to them.","Men may profess that God loves them when there is no such matter, and that they are the children of God, when the devil is their father; as it is in John 8:40-44.","Therefore they that do finally fall away from a profession of the grace of the Gospel, it is, first, because they are bastards and not sons.","Secondly, because as they are not sons, so God suffereth them to fall, to make it appear that they are not sons, not of the household of God--""They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt,"" mark that, ""no doubt,"" saith he, ""they would have continued with us: but they went out,"" from us, ""that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us"" (1 John 2:19).","And though Hymeneus and Philetus do throw themselves headlong to Hell, ""nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His"" (2 Tim 2:17-19).",Objection Third.,"But the Scripture saith that there are some that had faith, yet lost it, and have made shipwreck of it.",[The third objection].,"Now God loves no longer than they believe, as is evident; for ""he that believeth not shall be damned.""","So then, if some may have faith, and yet lose it, and so lose the love of God because they have lost their faith, it is evident that God's love is not so immutable as you say it is to every one that believeth.",Answ.,There are more sorts of faith than one that are spoken of in Scripture-- 1.,"There is a faith that man may have, and yet be nothing, none of the saints of God, and yet may do great things therewith (1 Cor 13:1-4).",2.,"There is a faith that was wrought merely by the operation of the miracles that were done in those days by Christ and his followers--""And many of the people believed in Him.""",How came they by their faith?,"Why, by the operation of the miracles that He did among them; for said they, ""When Christ cometh, will He do more miracles than these which this man hath done?""",(John 7:31).,"The great thing that wrought their faith in them, was only by seeing the miracles that He did, John 2:23, which is not that saving faith which is called the faith of God's elect, as is evident; for there must not be only miracles wrought upon outward objects to beget that--that being too weak a thing--but it must be by the same power that was stretched out in raising Christ from the dead; yea, the exceeding greatness of that power (Eph 1:18,19).","So there is a believing, being taken with some marvelous work, visibly appearing to the outward sense of seeing; and there is a believing that is wrought in the heart by an invisible operation of the Spirit, revealing the certainty of the satisfaction of the merits of Christ to the soul in a more glorious way, both for certainty and for durableness, both as to the promise and the constancy of it (Matt 16:17, 18).",3.,"There is a faith of a man's own, of a man's self also; but the faith of the operation of God, in Scripture, is set in opposition to that, for, saith He, you are saved by grace, ""through faith, and that not of yourselves,"" of your own making, but that which is the free gift of God (Eph 2:8).",4.,"We say there is an historical faith--that is, such as is begotten by the co-operation of the Spirit with the Word.",5.,"We say there is a traditional faith--that is, to believe things by tradition, because others say they believe them; this is received by tradition, not by revelation, and shall never be able to stand, neither at the day of death, nor at the day of judgment; though possibly men, while they live here, may esteem themselves and states to be very good, because their heads are filled full of it.",6.,"There is a faith that is called in Scripture a dead faith, the faith of devils, or of the devil; they also that have only this, they are like the devil, and as sure to be damned as he, notwithstanding their faith, if they get no better into their hearts; for it is far off from enabling of them to lay hold of Jesus Christ, and so to put Him on for eternal life and sanctification, which they must do if ever they be saved (James 2:19,26).","But all these are short of the saving faith of God's elect, as is manifest; I say, first, Because these may be wrought, and not by that power so exceedingly stretched forth.","Secondly, Because these are wrought, partly, (1.)","By the sense of seeing--namely, the miracles--not by hearing; and, (2.)","The rest is wrought by a traditional or historical influence of the words in their heads, not by a heavenly, invisible, almighty, and saving operation of the Spirit of God in their hearts.",7.,"I do suppose also that there is a faith that is wrought upon men through the influence of those gifts and abilities that God gives sometimes to those that are not His own by election, though by creation; my meaning is, some men, finding that God hath given them very great gifts and abilities,--as to the gifts of preaching, praying, working miracles, or the like--I say, therefore do conclude that God is their Father, and they are His children; the ground of which confidence is still begotten, not by the glorious operation of the Spirit, but by a considering of the great gifts that God hath bestowed upon them as to the things before-mentioned.","As thus, (1.)","the poor soul considers how ignorant it was, and now how knowing it is.",(2.),"Considering how vain it formerly was, and also now how civil it is, presently makes this conclusion--Surely God loves me, surely He hath made me one of His, and will save me.","This is now a wrong faith, as is evident, in that it is placed upon a wrong object; for mark, this faith is not placed assuredly on God's grace alone, through the blood and merits of Christ being discovered effectually to the soul, but upon God through those things that God hath given it, as of gifts, either to preach, or pray, or do great works, or the like, which will assuredly come to nought as sure as God is in Heaven, if no better faith and ground of faith be found out for thy soul savingly to rest upon.","As to the second clause of the objection, which runs to this effect, God loves men upon the account of their believing, I answer, that God loves men before they believe; He loves them, He calls them, and gives them faith to believe--""But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us,"" when?","when we believed, or before?","""even when we were dead in sins,"" and so, far off from believers, ""hath quickened us together with"" Christ, ""by grace ye are saved"" (Eph 2:4,5).","Now, also, I suppose that thou wilt say in thy heart, I would you would show us then what is saving faith; which thing it may be I may touch upon a while hence, in the next thing that I am to speak unto.",O they that have that are safe indeed!,SECOND.,WHO AND HOW MEN ARE ACTUALLY BROUGHT INTO THE NEW COVENANT.,The SECOND thing that I am to speak unto is this--WHO they are that are actually brought into this free and unchangeable grace; and also HOW they are brought in.,Answ.,"Indeed, now we come to the pinch of the whole discourse; and if God do but help me to run rightly through this, as I do verily believe He will, I may do thee, reader, good, and bring glory to my God.",The question containeth these two branches--FIRST.,Who are brought in; SECOND.,How they are brought in.,[FIRST.,Who are brought in?],"The first is quickly answered--""Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,"" Jewish sinners, Gentile sinners, old sinners, young sinners, great sinners, the chiefest of sinners.","Publicans and harlots--that is, whores, cheaters, and exactors--shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven (1 Tim 1:15; Rom 5:7-11; 1 Cor 6:9,11; Matt 21:31).","""For I come not,"" saith Christ, ""to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance"" (Mark 2:17).","A sinner in the Scripture is described in general to be a transgressor of the law--""Whosoever commiteth sin, transgresseth the law; for sin is the transgression of the law"" (1 John 3:4).","But particularly; they are described in a more particular way, as, 1.","Such as in whom dwelleth the devil (Eph 2:2,3).",2.,Such as will do the service of him (John 8:44).,3.,Such as are enemies to God (Col 1:21) 4.,"Such as are drunkards, whoremasters, liars, perjured persons, covetous, revilers, extortionists, fornicators, swearers, possessed with devils, thieves, idolaters, witches, sorcerers, conjurors, murderers, and the like (1 Cor 6:9,10; 2 Chron 33:1-13; Acts 2:36,37; 9:1-6; 19:9; 1 Tim 1:14-16).","These are sinners, and such sinners that God hath prepared Heaven, happiness, pardon of sin, and an inheritance of God, with Christ, with saints, with angels, if they do come in and accept of grace, as I might prove at large; for God's grace is so great, that if they do come to Him by Christ, presently all is forgiven them; therefore never object that thy sins are too great to be pardoned; but come, taste and see how good the Lord is to any whosoever come unto Him.",[SECOND.],"The second thing is, How are these brought into this Everlasting Covenant of Grace?",Answ.,"When God doth in deed and in truth bring in a sinner into this most blessed covenant, [Come to the Touchstone, sinner].","for so it is, He usually goeth this way-- First.","He slays or kills the party to all things besides Himself, and His Son Jesus Christ, and the comforts of the Spirit.","For the clearing of this I shall show you, 1.",With what God kills; 2.,How God kills; 3.,To what God kills those whom He makes alive in Jesus Christ.,1.,[What God kills].,"When God brings sinners into the Covenant of Grace, He doth first kill them with the Covenant of Works, which is the moral law, or Ten Commandments.","This is Paul's doctrine, and also Paul's experience.","It is his doctrine where he saith, ""The ministration of death, written and engraven in stones--the ministration of condemnation,"" which is the law, in that place called the letter, ""killeth"" (2 Cor 3:6-9).","The letter, saith he, killeth; or the law, or the ministration of death, which in another place is called ""the voice of words"" (Heb 12:19), because they have no life in them, but rather death and damnation, through our inability to fulfill them, doth kill (Rom 8:3; 2 Cor 6).","It is his experience where he saith, ""I was alive"" that is, to my own things, ""without the law once,"" that is, before God did strike him dead by it, ""but when the commandment came,"" that is, to do and exercise its right office on me, which was to kill me, then ""sin revived, and I died,"" and I was killed.","""And the commandment,"" or the law, ""which was ordained to"" be unto ""life, I found to be unto death.","For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me"" (Rom 7:9-11).",2.,"But how doth God kill with this law, or covenant?",1.,"By opening to the soul the spirituality of it--""The law is spiritual,"" saith he, ""but I am carnal, sold under sin"" (Rom 7:14).",Now the spirituality of the law is discovered this way-- (1.),By showing to the soul that every sinful thought is a sin against it.,"Ay, sinner, when the law doth come home indeed upon thy soul in the spirituality of it, it will discover such things to thee to be sins that now thou lookest over and regardest not; that is a remarkable saying of Paul when he saith, ""Sin revived, and I died.""","Sin revived, saith he; as if he had said, Those things that before I did not value nor regard, but looked upon them to be trifles, to be dead, and forgotten; but when the law was fastened on my soul, it did so raise them from the dead, call them into mind, so muster them before my face, and put such strength into them, that I was overmastered by them, by the guilt of them.","Sin revived by the commandment, or my sins had mighty strength, life, and abundance of force upon me because of that, insomuch that they killed me (Matt 5:28).",(2.),It showeth that every such sin deserveth eternal damnation.,"Friends, I doubt there be but few of you that have seen the spirituality of the law of works.","But this is one thing in which it discovereth its spirituality, and this is the proper work of the Law.",(3.),"God, with a discovery of this, doth also discover His own Divine and infinite justice, of which the law is a description, which backs what is discovered by the law, and that by discovering of its purity and holiness to be so Divine, so pure, so upright, and so far of from winking at the least sin, that He doth by that law, without any favour, condemn the sinner for that sin (Gal 3:10).","Now, when He hath brought the soul into this praemunire,13 into this puzzle, then, 2.","He showeth to the soul the nature and condition of the law as to its dealings with, or forbearing of, the sinner that hath sinned against it; which is to pass an eternal curse upon both soul and body of the party so offending, saying to him, Cursed be the man that continueth not in everything that is written in the Book of the Law to do it; for, saith the law, this is my proper work; first, to show thee thy sins; and when I have done that, then, in the next place, to condemn thee for them, and that without all remedy, as from ME, or anything within my bounds, for I am not to save any, to pardon any--nay, not to favour any in the least thing that have sinned against me; for God did not send me to make alive, but to discover sin, and to condemn for the same.","Now, so soon as this is presented to thy conscience, in the next place, the Lord also by this law doth show that now there is no righteous act according to the tenor of that covenant that can replieve him, or take him off from all this horror and curse that lies upon him; because that is not an administration of pardon, as I said before, to forgive the sin, but an administration of damnation, because of transgression.","O, the very discovery of this striketh the soul into a deadly swoon, even above half dead!","But when God doth do the work indeed, He doth, in the next place, show the soul that he is the man that is eternally under this covenant by nature, and that it is he that hath sinned against this law, and doth by right deserve the curse and displeasure of the same, and that all that ever he can do will not give satisfaction to that glorious justice that did give this law; holy actions, tears of blood, selling all, and giving it to the poor, or whatever else can be done by thee, it comes all short and is all to no purpose (Phil 3).","I will warrant him, he that seeth this, it will kill him to that which he was alive unto before, though he had a thousand lives.","Ah, sinners, sinners, were you but sensible indeed of the severity and truth of this, it would make you look about you to purpose!","O, how would it make you strive to stop at that that now you drink down with delight!",How many oaths would it make you bite asunder!,"Nay, it would make you bite your tongues to think that they should be used as instruments of the devil to bring your souls into such an unspeakable misery; then also we should not have you hang the salvation of your souls upon such slender pins as now you do; no, no; but you would be in another mind then.","O, then we should have you cry out, I must have Christ; what shall I do for Christ?",how shall I come at Christ?,"Would I was sure, truly sure of Christ.","My soul is gone, damned, cast away, and must for ever burn with the devils, if I do not get precious Jesus Christ!",3.,"In the next place, when God hath done this, then He further shows the soul that that covenant which it is under by nature is distinct from the Covenant of Grace; and also they that are under it are by nature without any of the graces which they have that are under the Covenant of Grace; as, (1.)",That it hath no faith (John 16:9).,(2.),No hope (Eph 2:12).,Nor none of the Spirit to work these things in it by nature.,(4.),Neither will that covenant give to them any peace with God.,(5.),No promise of safeguard from His revenging law by that covenant.,(6.),"But lieth by nature liable to all the curses, and condemnings, and thunderclaps of this most fiery covenant.",(7.),"That it will accept of no sorrow, no repentance, no satisfaction, as from thee.",(8.),That it calls for no less than the shedding of thy blood.,(9.),The damnation of thy soul and body.,(10.),"And if there be anything proffered to it by thee, as to the making of it amends, it throws it back again as dirt in thy face, slighting all that thou canst bring.","Now, when the soul is brought into this condition, then it is indeed dead, killed to that to which it was once alive.","And therefore, 3.","In the next place, to show you to what it is killed: and that is, 1.",To sin.,"O, it dares not sin!","it sees Hell-fire is prepared for them that sin, God's justice will not spare it if it live in sin; the Law will damn it if it live in sin; the devil will have it if it follows its sins.",[Here I am speaking of one that is effectually brought in].,"O, I say, it trembles at the very thoughts of sin!","Ay, if sin do but offer to tempt the soul, to draw away the soul from God, it cries, it sighs, it shunneth the very appearance of sin, it is odious unto it.","If God would but serve you thus that love your pleasures, you would not make such a trifle of sin as you do.",2.,It is killed to the Law of God as it is the Covenant of Works.,"O, saith the soul, the law hath killed me to itself, ""I through the law am dead to the law"" (Gal 2:19).",The law is another thing than I did think it was.,"I thought it would not have been so soul-destroying, so damning a law!","I thought it would not have been so severe against me for my little sins, for my playing, for my jesting, for my dissembling, quarreling, and the like.","I had some thoughts, indeed, that it would hew great sinners, but let me pass!","and though it condemned great sinners, yet it would pass me by!","But now, would I were free from this covenant, would I were free from this law!","I will tell thee that a soul thus worked upon is more afraid of the Covenant of Works than he is of the devil; for he sees it is the law that doth give him up into his hands for sin; and if he was but clear from that, he should not greatly need to fear the devil.","O, now every particular command tears the caul of his heart; now every command is a great gun well charged against his soul; now he sees he had as good run into a fire to keep himself from burning, as to run to the law to keep himself from damning; and this he sees really, ay, and feels it too, to his own sorrow and perplexity.",14 3.,"The soul also now is killed to his own righteousness, and counts that but dung, but dross, not worth the dirt hanging on his shoes.",O!,"then, says he, thou filthy righteousness!",how hast thou deceived me!,How hast thou beguiled my poor soul!,(Isa 64:6).,"How did I deceive myself with giving of a little alms; with abstaining from some gross pollutions; with walking in some ordinances, as to the outside of them!","How hath my good words, good thinkings, good meanings, as the world calls them, deceived my ignorant soul!","I want the righteousness of faith, the righteousness of God; for I see now there is no less will do me any good.",4.,"It is also killed to its own faith, its notion of the Gospel, its own hope, its own repentings, its own promises and resolutions, to its own strength, its own virtue, or whatsoever it had before.","Now, saith the soul, that faith I thought I had, it is but fancy; that hope I thought I had, I see it is by hypocritical, but vain and groundless hope.",[These things would be too tedious to enlarge upon].,"Now the soul sees it hath by nature no saving faith, no saving hope, no grace at all by nature, by the first covenant.","Now it crieth out, How many promises have I broken!","and how many times have I resolved in vain, when I was sick at such a time, and in such a strait at such a place!","Indeed, I thought myself a wise man once, but I see myself a very fool now.","O, how ignorant am I of the Gospel now, and of the blessed experience of the work of God on a Christian heart!","In a word, it sees itself beset by nature with all evil, and destitute of all good, which is enough to kill the stoutest, hardest-hearted sinner that ever lived on the earth.","O, friends, should you be plainly dealt withal by this discovery of the dealing of God with a sinner when He makes him a saint, and would seriously try your selves thereby, as God will try you one day, how few would there be found of you to be so much as acquainted with the work of God in the notion, much less in the experimental knowledge of the same!","And indeed, God is fain to take this way with sinners, thus to kill them with the old covenant to all things below a crucified Christ.",Six reasons of this discourse.,1.,Because otherwise there would be none in the world that would look after this sweet Jesus Christ.,"There are but a few that go to Heaven in all, comparatively; and those few God is fain to deal with them in this manner, or else His Heaven, His Christ, His glory, and everlasting happiness must abide by themselves, for all sinners.","Do you think that Manasseh would have regarded the Lord, had He not suffered his enemies to have prevailed against him?",(2 Chron 33:1-16).,"Do you think that Ephraim would have looked after salvation, had not God first confounded him with the guilt of the sins of his youth?",(Jer 31:18).,What do you think of Paul?,(Acts 9:4-6).,What do you think of the jailer?,(Acts 16:30-32).,What do you think of the three thousand?,"(Acts 2:36,37).",Was not this the way that the Lord was fain to take to make them close in with Jesus Christ?,"Was He not fain to kill them to everything below a Christ, that were driven to their wits' ends, insomuch that they were forced to cry out, ""What shall we do to be saved?""","I say, God might have kept Heaven and happiness to Himself, if He should not go this way to work with sinners.",O stout-hearted rebels!,O tender-hearted God!,2.,"Because then, and not till then, will sinners accept of Jesus Christ on God's terms.","So long as sinners can make a life out of anything below Christ, so long they will not close with Christ without indenting; 15 But when the God of Heaven hath killed them to everything below Himself and His Son, then Christ will down on any terms in the world.","And, indeed, this is the very reason why sinners, when they hear of Christ, yet will not close in with Him; there is something that they can take content in besides Him.","The prodigal, so long as he could content himself with the husks that the swine did eat, so long he did keep him away from his father's house; but when he could get no nourishment anywhere on this side of his father's house, then saith he, and not till then, ""I will arise, and go to my father,"" etc.","I say, this is the reason, therefore, why men come no faster, and close no more readily, with the Son of God, but stand halting and indenting 16 about the terms they must have Christ upon; for, saith the drunkard, I look on Christ to be worth the having; but yet I am not willing to lose ALL for him; all but my pot, saith the drunkard; and all but the world, saith the covetous.","I will part with anything but lust and pride, saith the wanton.","But if Christ will not be had without I forsake all, cast away all, then it must be with me as it was with the young man in the Gospel, such news will make me sorry at the very heart.","But now, when a man is soundly killed to all his sins, to all his righteousness, to all his comforts whatsoever, and sees that there is no way but the devil must leave him, but he must be damned in Hell if he be not clothed with Jesus Christ; O, then, saith he, give me Christ on any terms, whatsoever He cost; though He cost me friends, though He cost me comforts, though He cost me all that ever I have; yet, like the wise merchant in the Gospel, they will sell all to get that pearl.","I tell you, when a soul is brought to see its want of Christ aright, it will not be kept back; father, mother, husband, wife, lands, livings, nay, life and all, shall go rather than the soul will miss of Christ.","Ay, and the soul counteth Christ a cheap Saviour if he can get him upon any terms; now the soul indents17 no longer.","Now, Lord, give me Christ upon any terms, whatsoever He cost; for I am a dead man, a damned man, a castaway, if I have not Christ.","What say you, O you wounded sinners?",Is not this true as I have said?,"Would you not give ten thousand worlds, if you had so many, so be you might be well assured that your sins shall be pardoned, and your souls and bodies justified and glorified at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ?",3.,"The Lord goeth this way for this reason also, that it might make the soul sensible what it cost Christ to redeem it from death and Hell.","When a man cometh to feel the sting and guilt of sin, death and Hell upon his conscience, then, and not till then, can he tell what it cost Christ to redeem sinners.",O!,"saith the soul, if a few sins are so terrible, and lay the soul under such wrath and torment, what did Christ undergo, who bare the sins of thousands and thousands, and all at once?","This also is one means to make souls tender of sin (it is the burned child that feareth the fire), to make them humble in a sense of their own vileness, to make them count everything that God giveth them a mercy, to make much of the least glimpse of the love of God, and to prize it above the whole world.","O sinners, were you killed indeed [to sin], then Heaven would be Heaven, and Hell would be Hell indeed; but because you are not wrought upon in this manner, therefore you count the ways of God as bad as a good man counteth the ways of the devil, and the ways of the devil and Hell as good as a saint doth count the ways of God.",4.,"Again, God is fain to go this way, and all to make sinners make sure of Heaven.","So long as souls are senseless of sin, and what a damnable state they are in by nature, so long they will even dally with the Kingdom of Heaven and the salvation of their own poor souls; but when God cometh and showeth them where they are, and what it is like to become of them if they miss of the crucified Saviour, O, then, saith the soul, would I were sure of Jesus; what shall I do to get assurance of Jesus?","And thus is God forced, as I may say, to whip souls to Jesus Christ, they being so secure, so senseless, and so much their own enemies, as not to look out after their own eternal advantage.",5.,"A fifth reason why God doth deal thus with sinners it is, because He would bring Christ and the soul together in a right way.","Christ and sinners would never come together in a beloved posture, they would not so suitably suit each other, if they were not brought together this way, the sinner being killed.","O, when the sinner is killed, and indeed struck dead to everything below a naked Jesus, how suitably then doth the soul and Christ suit one with another.","Then here is a naked sinner for a righteousness Jesus, a poor sinner to a rich Jesus, a weak sinner to a strong Jesus, a blind sinner to a seeing Jesus, an ignorant, careless sinner to a wise and careful Jesus.","O, how wise is God in dealing thus with the sinner!","He strips him of his own knowledge, that He may fill him with Christ's; He killeth him for taking pleasure in sin, that he may take pleasure in Jesus Christ, etc.",6.,"God goeth this way with sinners, because He would have the glory of their salvation.","Should not men and women be killed to their own things, they would do sacrifice unto them, and instead of saying to the Lamb, ""THOU ART WORTHY,"" they would say their own arm, their own right hand hath saved them; but God will cut off boasting from ever entering within the borders of eternal glory; for He is resolved to have the glory of the beginning, the middle, and the end; of the contriving, and saving, and giving salvation to them that enter in to the joys of everlasting glory (Rom 3:27; Eph 2:8,9; Titus 3:5; Rev 5:9).","""That they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that He might be glorified"" (Isa 61:3).","I might have run through many things as to this; but I shall pass them, and proceed.",Second.,"Now, the soul being this killed to itself, [The soul that hath the right work of God upon its heart, is not only killed to itself, but also made alive to Christ].","its sins, its righteousness, faith, hope, wisdom, promises, resolutions, and the rest of its things which it trusted in by nature; in the next place, it hath also given unto it a most glorious, perfect, and never-fading life, which is-- 1.","A life imputed to it, yet so really, that the very thought of it in the soul hath so much operation and authority, especially when the mediation of it is mixed with faith, as to make it, though condemned by the law, to triumph, and to look its enemies in the face with comfort, notwithstanding the greatness of the multitude, the fierceness of their anger, and the continuation of their malice, be never so hot against it.","This imputed life--for so it is--is the obedience of the Son of God as His righteousness, in His suffering, rising, ascending, interceding, and so consequently triumphing over all the enemies of the soul, and given to me, as being wrought on purpose for me.","So that, is there righteousness in Christ?",that is mine.,Is there perfection in that righteousness?,that is mine.,Did He bleed for sin?,it was for mine.,"Hath He overcome the law, the devil, and Hell?","the victory is mine, and I am counted the conqueror, nay, more than a conqueror, through Him that hath loved me.","And I do count this a most glorious life; for by this means it is that I am, in the first place, proclaimed both in Heaven and earth guiltless, and such an one who, as I am in Christ, am not sinner, and so not under the law, to be condemned, but as holy and righteous as the Son of God Himself, because He Himself is my holiness and righteousness, and so likewise having by this all things taken out of the way that would condemn me.","Sometimes I bless the Lord my soul hath had the life that now I am speaking of, not only imputed to me, but the very glory of it upon my soul; for, upon a time, when I was under many condemnings of heart, and feared, because of my sins, my soul would miss of eternal glory, methought I felt in my soul such a secret motion of this--Thy righteousness is in Heaven, together with the splendour and shining of the Spirit of Grace in my soul, which gave me to see clearly that my righteousness by which I should be justified from all that could condemn, was the Son of God Himself in His own Person, now at the right hand of His Father representing me complete before the Mercy-seat in His Ownself; so that I saw clearly that night and day, wherever I was, or whatever I was a doing, still there was my righteousness just before the eyes of Divine glory; so that the Father could never find fault with me for any insufficiency that was in my righteousness, seeing it was complete; neither could He say, Where is it?",because it was continually at His right hand.,"18 Also, at another time, having contracted guilt upon my soul, and having some distemper of body upon me, I supposed that death might now so seize upon as to take me away from among men; then, thought I, what shall I do now?",is all right with my soul?,Have I the right work of God on my soul?,"Answering myself, ""No, surely""; and that because there were so many weaknesses in me; yes, so many weaknesses in my best duties.","For, thought I, how can such an one as I find mercy, whose heart is so ready to evil, and so backward to that which is good, so far as it is natural.","Thus musing, being filled with fear to die, these words come in upon my soul, ""Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus"" (Rom 3:24).","As if God had said, Sinner, thou thinkest because that thou hast had so many infirmities and weaknesses in thy soul while thou hast been professing of Me, therefore now there can be no hopes of mercy; but be it known unto thee, that it was not anything done by thee at the first that moved Me to have mercy upon thee: neither is it anything that is done by thee now that shall make me either accept or reject thee.","Behold My Son, who standeth by Me, He is righteous, He hath fulfilled My Law, and given me good satisfaction; on Him, therefore, do I look, and on thee only as thou art in Him; and according to what He hath done, so will I deal with thee.","This having stayed my heart, and taken off the guilt through the strength of its coming on my soul, anon after came in that word as a second testimony--""Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works,"" of righteousness which we have done, ""but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began"" (2 Tim 1:9).","And thus is the sinner made alive from the dead, being justified by grace through the righteousness of Christ, which is unto all and upon all them that believe, according to the Scriptures--""And the life which I now live--it is by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me"" (Gal 2:20).","""I lay down my life for the sheep.""","""I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly"" (John 10:10,15).","""For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.","That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord"" (Rom 5:10,21).",2.,"This life is not only imputed to him that is wrought on by the Spirit of Grace--that is, not only counted his, but also there is put into the soul an understanding, enlightened on purpose to know the things of God, which is Christ and His imputed righteousness (1 John 5:20) which it never thought of nor understood before (1 Cor 2:9-11).","Which understanding being enlightened and made to see such things that the soul cannot be contented without it lay hold of and apply Christ unto itself so effectually; I say, that the soul shall be exceedingly revived in a very heavenly measure with the application of this imputed righteousness; for thereby it knoweth it shall find God speaking peace to itself, with a fatherly affection, saying, ""Be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee""; the righteousness of My Son I bestow upon thee; ""For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through thee,"" thy ""flesh,"" ""I have sent forth My only Son, and have condemned"" thy sins in His flesh (Rom 8:3).","And though thou hast gone astray like a lost sheep, yet on Him I have laid thine iniquities; and though thou thereby didst undo and break thyself for ever, yet by His stripes I have healed thee.","Thus, I say, the Lord causeth the soul by faith to apply that which He doth by grace impute unto it, for thus every soul more or less is dealt withal; the soul being thus enlightened, thus quickened, thus made alive from that dead state it was in before, or at least having the beginnings of this life, it hath these several virtuous advantages, which they have not that are dead in their sins and trespasses, and under the law-- [Advantages possessed by the quickened].",First.,"It seeth what a sad condition all men by nature are in, they being in that state which itself was in but a while since; but now by grace it is a beginning to scrabble 19 out of it; now it seeth ""the whole world lieth in wickedness,"" and so liable to eternal vengeance, because of their wickedness (1 John 5:19).","Ah, friends, let me tell you, though you may be ignorant of your state and condition, yet the poor, groaning, hungering saints of God do see what a sad, woeful, miserable state you are in, which sometimes makes them tremble to think of your most lamentable latter end, your dying so, and also to fly the faster to their Lord Jesus, for very fear that they also should be partakers of that most doleful doom.","[Like as the children of Israel, who fled for fear when the ground opened its mouth to swallow up Korah and his company].","And this it hath by virtue of its own experience, knowing itself was but awhile ago in the same condition, under the same condemnation.",O!,"there is now a hearth blessing of God that ever He should show to it its sad condition, and that He should incline its heart to seek after a better condition.",O blessed be the Lord!,"saith the soul, that ever He should awaken me, stir up me, and bring me out of that sad condition that I once with them was in (Psa 103:1-3).","It makes also the soul to wonder to see how foolishly and vainly the rest of its neighbours do spend their precious time, that they should be so void of understanding, so forgetful of their latter end, so senseless of the damning nature of their sins.",O that their eyes were but enlightened to see whereabouts they are!,surely they would be of another mind than they are now in.,"Now, the soul wonders to see what slender pins those poor creatures do hang the stress of the eternal salvation of their souls upon.",O!,"methinks, saith the soul, it makes me mourn to see that some should think that they were born Christians; and others, that their baptism makes them so; 20 others depend barely upon a traditional, historical faith, which will leave their souls in the midst of perplexity.","That they should trust to such fables, fancies, and wicked sleights of the devil, as their good doings, their good thinkings, their civil walking and living with the world.","O miserable profession, and the end thereof will be a miserable end!","But now, when the souls is thus wrought upon, it must be sure to look for the very gates of Hell to be set open against it with all their force and might to destroy it.","Now Hell rageth, the devil roareth, and all the world resolveth to do the best they can to bring the soul again into bondage and ruin.","Also, the soul shall not want enemies, even in its own heart's lust, [But this is but for the exercise of his faith.]","as covetousness, adultery, blasphemy, unbelief, hardness of heart, coldness, half-heartedness, ignorance, with an innumerable company of attendants, hanging, like so many blocks, at its heels, ready to sink it into the fire of Hell every moment, together with strange apprehensions of God and Christ, as if now they were absolutely turned to be its enemies, which maketh it doubt of the certainty of its salvation; for you must understand, that though a soul may in reality have the righteousness of the Son of God imputed to it, and also some faith in a very strong manner to lay hold upon it, yet at another time, through temptation, they may fear and doubt again, insomuch that the soul may be put into a very great fear lest it should return again into the condition it once was in (Jer 32:40).","O, saith the soul, when I think of my former state, how miserable it was, it makes me tremble; and when I think that I may fall into that condition again, how sad are the thoughts of it to me!",I would not be in that condition again for all the world.,"And this fear riseth still higher and higher, as the soul is sensible of Satan's temptations, or of the working of its own corruptions.",Ah!,"these filthy lusts, these filthy corruptions.","O that I were rid of them, that they were consumed in a moment, that I could be quite rid of them, they do so disturb my soul, dishonour my God, so defile my conscience, and sometimes so weaken my hands in the way of God, and my comforts in the Lord; O how glad should I be if I might be stripped of them (Rom 7:24).","Which fear puts the soul upon flying to the Lord by prayer for the covering of His imputed righteousness, and for strength against the devil's temptations and its own corruptions; that God would give down His Holy Spirit to strengthen it against the things that do so annoy its soul, and so discourage it in its way, with a resolution, through grace, never to be contented while [until] it doth find in itself a triumphing over it, by faith in the blood of a crucified Jesus.",Second.,"The soul that hath been thus killed by the Law to the things it formerly delighted in, now, O now, it cannot be contented with that slender, groundless faith and hope that once it contented itself withal.","No, no; but now it must be brought into the right saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, now it must have Him discovered to the soul by the Spirit, now it cannot be satisfied because such and such do tell it is so.","No; but now it will cry out, Lord, show me continually, in the light of Thy Spirit, through Thy Word, that Jesus that was born in the days of Caesar Augustus, when Mary, a daughter of Judah, went with Joseph to be taxed at Bethlehem, that He is the very Christ.","Lord, let me see it in the light of Thy Spirit, and in the operation thereof; and let me not be contented without such a faith that is so wrought even by the discovery of His birth, crucifying, death, blood, resurrection, ascension, intercession, and second--which is His personal--coming again, that the very faith of it may fill my soul with comfort and holiness.","And O, how afraid the soul is lest it should fall short of this faith, and of the hope that is begotten by such discoveries as these are!","For the soul knoweth that if it hath not this, it will not be able to stand either in death or judgment; and therefore, saith the soul, Lord, whatever other poor souls content themselves withal, let me have that which will stand me in stead, and carry me through a dangerous world; that may help me to resist a cunning devil; that may help me to suck true soul-satisfying consolation from Jesus Christ through Thy promises, by the might and power of Thy Spirit.","And now, when the poor soul at any time hath any discovery of the love of God through a bleeding, dying, risen, interceding Jesus, because it is not willing to be deceived, O, how wary [But this may be its temptation, taking place through the timorousness of the soul].","is it of closing with it, for fear it should not be right, for fear it should not come from God!","Saith the soul, Cannot the devil give one such comfort I trow?",Cannot he transform himself thus into an angel of light?,"So that the soul, because that it would be upon a sure ground, cries out, Lord, show me Thy salvation, and that not once or twice, but, Lord, let me have Thy presence continually upon my heart, today, and tomorrow, and every day.","For the soul, when it is rightly brought from under the Covenant of Works, and planted into the Covenant of Grace, then it cannot be, unless it be under some desperate temptation, contented without the presence of God, teaching, comforting, establishing, and helping of the soul to grow in the things of the Lord Jesus Christ; because it knoweth that if God hath but withdrawn His presence in any way from it, as He doth do sometimes for a while, that then the devil will be sure to be near at hand, working with his temptations, trying all ways to get the soul into slavery and sin again; also the corrupt principle, that will be joining and combining with the Wicked One, and will be willing to be a co-partner with him to bring the soul into mischief; which puts a soul upon an earnest, continual panting after more of the strengthening, preserving, comforting, and teaching presence of God, and for strong supplies of faith, that it may effectually lay hold on him.",Third.,The soul is quickened so that it is not satisfied now without it do in deed and in truth partake of the peace of God's elect; now it is upon the examination of the reality of its joy and peace.,"Time was indeed that anything would serve its turn, any false conceits of its state to be good; but now all kind of peace will not serve its turn, all kind of joy will not be accepted with it; now it must joy in God through Jesus Christ; now its peace must come through the virtues of the blood of Christ speaking peace to the conscience by taking away both the guilt and filth of sin by that blood; also by showing the soul its free acceptance with God through Christ, He hath completely fulfilled all the conditions of the first covenant, and freely placed it into the safety of what He hath done, and so presents the soul complete and spotless in the sight of God through His obedience.","Now, I say, he hath ""peace through the blood of His Cross,"" and sees himself reconciled to God by the death of His Son, or else his comfort will be questioned by him (Col 1:20,21).","It is not every promise as cometh now upon his heart that will serve his turn, no, but he must see whether the babe Jesus be presented to the soul in and through that promise.","Now if the babe leap in his womb, as I may so say, it is because the Lord's promise sounds aloud in his heart, coming to him big with the love and pardoning grace of God in Jesus Christ; I say, this is the first and principal joy that the soul hath that is quickened and brought into the Covenant of Grace.",Fourth.,"Now the man finds heavenly sanctification wrought in his soul through the most precious blood of the Man whose name is Jesus Christ--""Jesus, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered without the gate.""","Now the souls finds a change in the understanding, in the will, in the mind, in the affections, in the judgment, and also in the conscience; through the inward man a change, and through the outward man a change, from head to foot, as we use to say, ""for he that is in Christ,"" and so in this Covenant of Grace, ""is a new creature,"" or hath been twice made--made, and made again (2 Cor 5:17).","O, now the soul is resolved for Heaven and Glory; now it crieth out, Lord, if there be a right eye that is offensive to Thee, pluck it out; or a right foot, cut it off; or a right hand, take it from me.","Now the soul doth begin to study how it may honour God, and bring praise to Him.","Now the soul is for a preparation for the second coming of Christ, endeavouring to lay aside everything that may hinder; and for the closing in with those things that may make it in a beloved posture against that day.",Fifth.,"And all this is from a Gospel spirit, and not from a legal, natural principle, for the soul hath these things as the fruits and effects of its being separated unto the Covenant of Grace, and so now possessed with that Spirit that doth attend, yea, and dwell in them that are brought into the Covenant of Grace from under the old covenant; I say, these things do spring forth in the soul from another root and stock than any of the actings of other men do; for the soul that is thus wrought upon is as well dead to the law and the righteousness thereof--as the first covenant--as well as to its sins.",Sixth.,"Now the soul begins to have some blessed experience of the things of God, even of the glorious mysteries of the Gospel.",1.,"Now it knoweth the meaning of those words, ""My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink, indeed,"" and that by experience; for the soul hath received peace of conscience through that blood, by the effectual application of it to the soul (John 6:55).","First, by feeling the guilt of sin die off from the conscience by the operation thereof.","Secondly, By feeling the power thereof to take away the curse of the law.","Thirdly, By finding the very strength of Hell to fail when once the blood of that Man Jesus Christ is received in reality upon the soul.",2.,"Now the soul also knoweth by experience the meaning of that Scripture that saith, ""Our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed"" (Rom 6:6).","Now it sees that when the Man Jesus did hang on the tree on Mount Calvary, that then the body of its sins was there hanged up, dead and buried with Him, though it was then unborn, so as never to be laid to its charge, either here or hereafter; and also, so as never to carry it captive into perpetual bondage, being itself overcome by Him, even Christ, the Head of that poor creature.","And indeed this is the way for a soul both to live comfortably as touching the guilt of sin, and also as touching the power of the filth of sin; for the soul that doth or hath received this in deed and in truth, finds strength against them both by and through that Man that did for him and the rest of his fellow-sinners so gloriously overcome it, and hath given the victory unto them, so that now they are said to be overcomers, nay, ""more than conquerors through Him,"" the one Man Jesus Christ (Rom 7:33-37).",3.,"Now the soul hath received a faith indeed, and a lively hope indeed, such an one as now it can fetch strength from the fullness of Christ, and from the merits of Christ.",4.,"Yea, now the soul can look on itself with one eye, and look upon Christ with another, and say, Indeed, it is true; I am an empty soul, but Christ is a full Christ; I am a poor sinner, but Christ is a rich Christ; I am a foolish sinner, but Christ is a wise Christ; I am an unholy, ungodly, unsanctified creature in myself, but Christ is made of God ""unto me, wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption"" (1 Cor 1:30).",5.,"Now also that fiery law, that it could not once endure, nor could not once delight in, I say, now it can delight in it after the inward man; now this law is its delight, it would always be walking in it, and always be delighting in it, being offended with any sin or any corruption that would be anyways an hinderance to it (Rom 7:24,25).","And yet it will not abide, it will not endure that that, even that that law should offer to take the work of its salvation out of Christ's hand; no, if it once comes to do that, then out of doors it shall go, if it were as good again.","For that soul that hath the right work of God indeed upon it, cries, Not my prayers, not my tears, not my works, not my things, do they come from the work of the Spirit of Christ itself within me, yet these shall not have the glory of my salvation; no, it is none but the blood of Christ, the death of Christ, of the Man Christ Jesus of Nazareth, the carpenter's son, as they called Him, that must have the crown and glory of my salvation.","None but Christ, none but Christ.",And thus the soul labours to give Christ the preeminence (Col 1:18).,A word of experience.,"Now, before I go any further, I must needs speak a word from my own experience of the things of Christ; and the rather, because we have a company of silly ones in this day of ignorance that do either comfort themselves with a notion without the power, or else do both reject the notion and the power of this most glorious Gospel; therefore, for the further conviction of the reader, I shall tell him, with David, something of what the Lord hath done for my soul; and indeed a little of the experience of the things of Christ is far more worth than all the world.","It would be too tedious for me to tell thee here all from the first to the last; but something I shall tell thee, that thou mayest not think these things are fables.","[This conviction seized on my soul one Sabbath day, when I was at play, being one of the first that I had, which when it came, though it scared me with its terror, yet through the temptation of the devil, immediately striking in therewith, I did rub it off again, and became as vile for some time as I was before, like a wretch that I was].","21 Reader, when it pleased the Lord to begin to instruct my soul, He found me one of the black sinners of the world; He found me making a sport of oaths, and also of lies; and many a soul-poisoning meal did I make out of divers lusts, as drinking, dancing, playing, pleasure with the wicked ones of the world.","The Lord finding of me in this condition, did open the glass of His Law unto me, wherein He showed me so clearly my sins, both the greatness of them, and also how abominable they were in His sight, that I thought the very clouds were charged with the wrath of God, and ready to let fall the very fire of His jealousy upon me; yet for all this I was so wedded to my sin, that, thought I with myself, I will have them though I lose my soul, (O wicked wretch that I was!)","but God, the great, the rich, the infinite merciful God, did not take this advantage of my soul to cast me away, and say, Then take him, Devil, seeing he cares for Me no more; no, but He followed me still, and won upon my heart, by giving me some understanding, not only into my miserable state, which I was very sensible of, but also that there might be hopes of mercy; also taking away that love to lust, and placing in the room thereof a love to religion; and thus the Lord won over my heart to some desire after the means, to hear the Word, and to grow a stranger to my old companions, and to accompany the people of God, together with giving of me many sweet encouragements from several promises in the Scriptures.","But after this, the Lord did wonderfully set my sins upon my conscience, those sins especially that I had committed since the first convictions; temptations also followed me very hard, and especially such temptations as did tend to the making me question of the very way of salvation--viz., whether Jesus Christ was the Saviour or no; and whether I had best to venture my soul upon His blood for salvation, or take some other course.","But being through grace kept close with God, in some measure, in prayer and the rest of the ordinances, but went about a year and upwards without any sound evidence as from God to my soul touching the salvation that comes by Jesus Christ.","But, at the last, as I may say, when the set time was come, the Lord, just before the men called Quakers came into the country, did set me down so blessedly in the truth of the doctrine of Jesus Christ, that it made me marvel to see, first, how Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, walked in the world awhile with His disciples, afterwards hanged on the Cross, spilt His blood, was buried, rose again, ascended above the clouds and heavens, there lives to make intercession, and that He also will come again at the last day to judge the world, and take His saints unto Himself.","These things, I say, I did see so evidently, even as if I had stood when He was in the world, and also when He was caught up.","I having such a change as this upon my soul, it made me wonder; and musing with myself at the great alteration that was in my spirit--for the Lord did also very gloriously give me in His precious Word to back the discovery of the Son of God unto me, so that I can say, through grace, it was according to the Scriptures (1 Cor 15:1-4).","And as I was musing with myself what these things should mean, methought I heard such a word in my heart as this--I have set thee down on purpose, for I have something more than ordinary for thee to do; which made me the more marvel, saying, What, my Lord, such a poor wretch as I?","Yet still this continued, I have set thee down on purpose, and so forth, with more fresh incomes of the Lord Jesus, and the power of the blood of His Cross upon my soul, even so evidently that I saw, through grace, that it was the blood shed on Mount Calvary that did save and redeem sinners, as clearly and as really with the eyes of my soul as ever, me thought, I had seen a penny loaf bought with a penny; which things then discovered had such operation upon my soul, that I do hope they did sweetly season every faculty thereof.","Reader, I speak in the presence of God, and He knows I lie not; much of this, and such like dealings of His, could I tell thee of; but my business at this time is not so to do, but only to tell what operation the blood of Christ hath had over and upon my conscience, and that at several times, and also when I have been in several frames of spirit.","As, first, sometimes, I have been so loaden with my sins, that I could not tell where to rest, nor what to do; yea, at such times I thought it would have taken away my senses; yet at that time God through grace hath all of a sudden so effectually applied the blood that was spilt at Mount Calvary out of the side of Jesus, unto my poor, wounded, guilty conscience, that presently I have found such a sweet, solid, sober, heart-comforting peace, that it hath made me as if it [my terror] had not been, and withal the same, I may say, and I ought to say, the power of it, hath had such a powerful operation upon my soul, that I have for a time been in a strait and trouble to think that I should love and honour Him no more, the virtue of His blood hath so constrained me.","Again; sometimes methinks my sins have appeared so big to me that I thought one of my sins have been as big as all the sins of all the men in the nation; ay, and of other nations too, reader; these things be not fancies, for I have smarted for this experience, but yet the least stream of the heart blood of this Man 22 Jesus hath vanished all away, and hath made it to fly, to the astonishment of such a poor sinner; and as I said before, hath delivered me up into sweet and heavenly peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.","Again; sometimes when my heart hath been hard, dead, slothful, blind, and senseless, which indeed are sad frames for a poor Christian to be in, yet at such a time, when I have been is such a case, then hath the blood of Christ, the precious blood of Christ, the admirable blood of the God of Heaven, that run out of His body when it did hang on the Cross, so softened, livened, quickened, and enlightened my soul, that truly, reader, I can say, O it makes me wonder!","Again; when I have been loaden with sin, and [I cannot stand here to tell thee of particular temptations].","pestered with several temptations, and in a very sad manner, then have I had the trial of the virtue of Christ's blood with the trial of the virtue of other things; and I have found that when tears would not do, prayers would not do, repentings and all other things could not reach my heart; O then, one touch, one drop, one shining of the virtue of the blood, of that blood that was let out with the spear, it hath in a very blessed manner delivered me, that it hath made me to marvel.",O!,"methinks it hath come with such life, such power, with such irresistible and marvelous glory, that it wipes off all the slurs, silences all the outcries, and quenches all the fiery darts, and all the flames of Hell-fire, that are begotten by the charges of the Law, Satan, and doubtful remembrances of my sinful life.","Friends, as Peter saith to the church, so I say to you, I have not preached to you cunningly devised fables in telling you of the blood of Christ, and what authority it hath had upon my conscience; O no, but as Peter saith touching the coming of the Lord Jesus into the world, so in some measure I can say of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that was shed when He did come into the world.","There is not only my single testimony touching this; no, but there are all the Prophets do agree in advancing this in writing, and also all the saints do now declare the same, in speaking forth the amiableness and many powerful virtues thereof.","""As for Thee also, by the blood of Thy covenant,"" saith God to Christ, ""I have sent forth Thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water"" (Zech 9:11).","""We have redemption through His blood"" (Eph 1:7).","Again, ""We have redemption through His blood"" (Col 1:14).","Our robes are washed and made ""white in the blood of the Lamb"" (Rev 7:14).","The devil is overcome through ""the blood of the Lamb"" (Rev 12:11).","Yea, and conscience is purged, too, and that through the blood of the Lamb (Heb 9:14).",We have free recourse to the Throne of Grace through the blood of Jesus (Heb 10:19).,"I could bring thee a cloud of witnesses out of all the types and shadows, and out of the sundry Prophets, and much more out of the New Testament, but I forebear, because I would not be too tedious to the reader in making too large a digression, though I have committed here in this discourse no transgression, for the blood of Christ is precious blood (1 Peter 1:18,19).",THIRD.,THE PRIVILEGES OF THE NEW COVENANT.,"In the next place, I shall show you the several privileges and advantages that the man or woman hath that is under this Covenant of Grace, over what they have that are under the Covenant of the Law and Works.","As, First.","The Covenant of Grace is not grounded upon our obedience, but upon God's love, even His pardoning love to us through Christ Jesus.","The first covenant is stood to be broken or kept by us, and God's love or anger to be lost or enjoyed thereafter as we, as creatures, behaved ourselves; but now, the very ground of the Covenant of Grace is God's love, His mere love through Jesus Christ--""The LORD did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: but because the LORD loved you, and because He would keep the oath which He had sworn unto your fathers"" (Deu 7:7,8).","Again, ""In His love and in His pity He redeemed them,"" ""and the angel of His presence saved them,"" that is, Jesus Christ (Isa 63:9).","And again, ""Who hath saved us--not according to our works"" of righteousness which we have done, ""but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began"" (2 Tim 1:9).",Second.,"This love is not conveyed to us through what we have done, as is before proved, but through what He hath done with Whom the covenant was made, which was given us in Christ--According as He hath chosen us in Christ.","""Who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.""","""God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,"" that is, through Christ's doings, through Christ's sufferings (2 Tim 1:9; Eph 1:3,4; 4:32).","Now if this be but rightly understood, it doth discover abundance of comfort to them, that are within the bounds of the Covenant of Grace.","For, 1.","Here a believer seeth he shall stand, if Christ's doings and sufferings stand; which is sure foundation, for God dealeth with him through Christ.","And so, secondly, he shall not fall, unless the suffering and merits of Christ be thrown over the bar, being found guilty, which will never be, before the eyes of Divine justice; for with Him the covenant was made, and He was the Surety of it; that is, as the covenant was made with Him, so He stood bound to fulfill the same (Zech 9:11; Heb 7:22).","For you must understand that the covenant was made between the Father and the Son long before it was accomplished, or manifestly sealed with Christ's blood; it was made before the world began (Titus 1:2; Eph 1:4; 1 Peter 1:18-20).","But the conditions thereof were not fulfilled until less than two thousand years ago; and all that while did Jesus stand bound as a surety, as I said before, is used to do, till the time in which the payment should be made.","And it was by virtue of His Suretyship, having bound Himself by covenant to do all things agreed on by the Father and Him, that all those of the election that were born before He came, that they might be saved, and did enter into rest.","For the forgiveness of sins that were past, though it was through the blood of Christ, yet it was also through the forbearance of God (Rom 3:25).","That is, Christ becoming Surety for those that died before His coming, that He should in deed and in truth, at the fullness of time, or at the time appointed, give a complete and full satisfaction for them according to the tenor or condition of the covenant.",(Gal 4:4).,"Again, 2.","The second covenant, which believers are under, as the ground and foundation, if it is safe, so the promises thereof are better, surer, freer, and fuller, etc.",(1.),"They are better, if you compare the excellency of the one with the excellency of the other.","The first hath promised nothing but an early paradise--Do this, and thou shalt live; namely, here in an earthly paradise.",But the other doth bring the promise of a heavenly paradise.,(2.),"As the Covenant of Works doth promise an earthly paradise, yet it is a paradise or blessing, though once obtained, yet might be lost again; for no longer than thou doest well, no longer art thou blessed by that.","O, but the promises in the new covenant do bring unto us the benefit of an eternal inheritance--That ""they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.""",O rare!,"it is an ""eternal inheritance"" (Heb 9:15).",(3.),"The other, as it is not so good as this, so neither is it so sure as this; and therefore he calls the one such an one as might be, and was, shaken, but this is said to be such an one that cannot be shaken.","""And this Word,"" saith he, treating of the two covenants from verse the 8th to the 24th--""And this Word, yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are,"" or may be, ""shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken,"" which is the second covenant, ""may remain,"" (Heb 12:27); for, saith he (verse 28) ""which cannot be moved.""","Therefore, ye blessed saints, seeing you have received a kingdom ""which cannot be moved,"" therefore, ""let us have grace, whereby we may serve"" our ""God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.""","Thus in general, but more particularly.",(4.),"They are surer, in that they are founded upon God's love also, and they come to us without calling for those things at our hands that may be a means of putting of a stop to our certain enjoying of them.","The promises under, or for the law, they might easily be stopped by our disobedience; but the promises under the Gospel say, ""If Heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched,"" then, and not till then, ""I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done"" (Jer 31:37).","Again, ""I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy transgressions for Mine own"" name's ""sake, and will not remember thy sins"" (Isa 43:25).","I will make thee a partaker of My promise; and that I may so do, I will take away that which would hinder; ""I will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea,"" that My promise may be sure to all the seed; and therefore, saith the Apostle, when he would show us that the new-covenant promises were more sure than the old, he tells us plainly that the law and works are set aside and they are merely made ours through the righteousness of faith, which is the righteousness of Christ--""For the promise, that he [Abraham] should be the heir of the world,"" saith he, ""was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law,"" or works, ""but through the righteousness of faith.","For if they which are of the law,"" or of works, ""be heirs,"" then ""faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect.","Therefore it is of faith--to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed"" (Rom 4:13-14,16).",(5.),"Surer, because that as that is taken away that should hinder, so they are committed to a faithful Friend of ours in keeping.","For all the promises of God are in Christ, not yea and nay, but yea and amen; certain and sure; sure, because they are in the hand of our Head, our Friend, our Brother, our Husband, our flesh and bones, even in the heart and hand of our precious Jesus.",(6.),"Because all the conditions of them are already fulfilled for us by Jesus Christ, as aforesaid; every promise that is a new-covenant promise, if there be any condition in it, our Undertaker hath accomplished that for us, and also giveth us such grace as to receive the sweetness as doth spring from them through His obedience to every thing required in them.",(7.),"Surer, because that as they are grounded upon the love of God, everything is taken out of the way, in the hand of a sure Friend.","And has Christ has fulfilled every condition as to justification that is contained therein, so the Lord hath solemnly sworn with an oath for our better confidence in this particular--""For when God made promise to Abraham,"" and so to all the saints, ""because He could swear by no greater, He sware by Himself, saying, Surely, blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.","And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.","For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife,"" that there might be no more doubt or scruple concerning the certain fulfilling of the promise.","""Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel,"" or certain, constant, unchangeable decree of God in making of the promise, for the comfort of his children, ""confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things,"" His promise backed with an oath, ""in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us"" (Heb 6:13-18).",(8.),That they are better it appears also in that they are freer and fuller.,"That they are freer, it is evident, in that one saith, No works, no life--Do this, and then thou shalt live; if not, thou shalt be damned.","But the other saith, We are saved by believing in what Another hath done, without the works of the Law--""Now to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness"" (Rom 4:4,5).","The one saith, Pay me that thou owest; the other say, I do frankly and freely forgive thee all.","The one saith, Because thou hast sinned, thou shalt die; the other saith, Because Christ lives, thou shalt live also (John 15).",(9.),"And as they are freer, so they are fuller; fuller of encouragement, fuller of comfort; the one, to wit, the law, looks like Pharaoh's seven ill-favoured kine, more ready to eat one up than to afford us any food; the other is like the full grape in the cluster, which for certain hath a glorious blessing in it.","The one saith, If thou hast sinned, turn again; the other saith, If thou hast sinned, thou shalt be damned, for all I have a promise in me.",3.,"They that are of the second are better than they that are of the first; and it also appeareth in this--The promises of the Law, through them we have neither faith, nor hope, nor the Spirit conveyed; but through the promises of the Gospel there are all these--""Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these we might be partakers of the Divine nature"" (2 Peter 1:4).","O therefore ""let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; for He is faithful that promised"" (Heb 10:23).","""In hope of eternal life,"" how so?","because ""God, that cannot lie, promised it before the world began"" (Titus 1:2).",4.,"They that are in this covenant are in a very happy state; for though there be several conditions in the Gospel to be done, yet Christ Jesus doth not look that they should be done by man, as man, but by His own Spirit in them, as it is written, ""Thou hast wrought all our works in us.""","Is there that condition, they must believe?","Why, then, He will be both the ""author and finisher of their faith"" (Heb 12:2,3).",Is there also hope to be in His children?,"He also doth and hath given them ""good hope through His grace"" (2 Thess 2:16).","Again, are the people of God to behave themselves to the glory of God the Father?","then He will work in them ""both to will and to do of His own good pleasure"" (Phil 2:13).",5.,"Again, as He works all our works in us and for us, so also by virtue of this covenant we have another nature given unto us, whereby, or by which we are made willing to be glorifying of God, both in our bodies and in our spirits, which are His--""Thy people shall be willing in the day of Thy power"" (1 Cor 6:20; Psa 110:3).",6.,"In the next place, all those that are under this second covenant are in a wonderful safe condition; for in case they should slip or fall after their conversion into some sin or sins for who lives and sins not?","(Prov 24:16), yet through the merits and intercession of Christ Jesus, who is their Undertaker in this covenant, they shall have their sins pardoned, their wounds healed, and they raised up again; which privilege the children of the first covenant have not; for if they sin, they are never afterwards regarded by that covenant--They brake My covenant and I regarded them not, saith the Lord (Heb 8:9).","But when He comes to speak of the Covenant of Grace, speaking first of the public person under the name of David, He saith thus, ""He shall cry unto Me, Thou art My Father, My God, and the rock of My salvation.","Also I will make Him My firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.","My mercy will I keep for Him for evermore, and My covenant shall stand fast with Him.","His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and His throne as the days of heaven.","If His children forsake My law, and walk not in My judgments; If they break my statutes, and keep not My commandments; Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.","Nevertheless My lovingkindness will I not utterly take from Him, nor suffer My faithfulness to fail.","My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of My lips.",Once have I sworn by My holiness that I will not lie unto David.,"His seed shall endure for ever, and His throne as the sun before Me.","It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven"" (Psa 89:26-37).","""My covenant shall stand fast with him""--mark that.","As if God had said, I did not make this covenant with man, but with My Son, and with Him I will perform it; and seeing He hath given Me complete satisfaction, though His children do, through infirmity, transgress, yet My covenant is not therefore broken, seeing He with whom it was made standeth firm, according to the desire of my heart; so that My justice that is satisfied, and My Law, hath nothing to say, for there is no want of perfection in the sacrifice of Christ.","If you love your souls, and would have them live in the peace of God, to the which you are called in one body, even all believers, then I beseech you seriously to ponder, and labour to settle in your souls this one thing, that the new covenant is not broken by our transgressions, and that because it was not made with us.","The reason why the very saints of God have so many ups and downs in this their travel towards Heaven, it is because they are so weak in the faith of this one thing; for they think that if they fail of this or that particular performance, if their hearts be dead and cold, and their lusts mighty and strong, therefore now God is angry, and now He will shut them out of His favour, now the new covenant is broken, and now Christ Jesus will stand their Friend no longer; now also the devil hath power again, and now they must have their part in the resurrection of damnation; when, alas!","the covenant is not for all this never the more broken, and so the grace of God no more straitened than it was before.","Therefore, I say, when thou findest that thou art weak here, and failing there, backward to this good, and thy heart forward to that evil; then be sure thou keep a steadfast eye on the Mediator of this new covenant, and be persuaded that it is not only made with Him, and His part also fulfilled, but that He doth look upon His fulfilling of it, so as not to lay thy sins to thy charge, though He may as a Father chastise thee for the same--""If His children forsake My law, and walk not in My judgments; if they break My statutes, and keep not My commandments; then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.","Nevertheless,"" mark ""nevertheless My lovingkindness will I not utterly take from HIM, nor suffer My faithfulness to fail.","My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of My lips.""",And what was that?,"Why, that ""His seed shall endure for ever, and His throne as the sun before Me"" (Psa 89:30-34,36).",7.,"Another privilege that the saints have by virtue of the new covenant is, that they have part of the possession or hold of Heaven and Glory already, and that two manner of ways--(1.)","The Divine nature is conveyed from Heaven into them; and, secondly, the human nature, i.e., the nature of man, is received up, and entertained in, and hath got possession of Heaven.","We have the first-fruits of the Spirit, saith the man of God; we have the earnest of the Spirit, which is instead of the whole, for it is the earnest of the whole--""Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory"" (Eph 1:13,14; Rom 8:8-11).",(2.),"The nature of man, our nature is got into glory as the first-fruits of mankind, as a forerunner to take possession till we all come thither (1 Cor 15:20).","For the Man born at Bethlehem is ascended, which is part of the lump of mankind, into glory as a public Person, as the first-fruits, representing the whole of the children of God; so that in some sense it may be said that the saints have already taken possession of the kingdom of Heaven by their Jesus, their public Person, He being in their room entered to prepare a place for them (John 14:1-4).","I beseech you consider, when Jesus Christ came down from Glory, it was that He might bring us to Glory; and that He might be sure not to fail, He clothed Himself with our nature, as if one should take a piece out of the whole lump instead of the whole, until the other comes, and investeth it in that glory which He was in before He came down from Heaven (Heb 2:14,15).","And thus is that saying to be understood, speaking of Christ and His saints, which saith, ""And"" He ""hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus"" (Eph 2:6).",8.,"Again, not only thus, but all the power of God, together with the rest of His glorious attributes, are on our side, in that they dwell in our nature, which is the Man Jesus, and doth engage for us poor, simple, empty, nothing creatures as to our eternal happiness (1 Peter 1:5).","""For in Him,"" that is, in the Man Christ, who is our nature, our Head, our root, our flesh, our bone, ""dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily"" (Col 2:9,10).","Mark how they are joined together, ""In whom dwelleth the fullness of the Godhead.","And ye are complete in Him.""","God dwelleth completely in Him, and you also are completely implanted in Him, which is the Head of all principality and power; and all this by the consent of the Father--""For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell"" (Col 1:19).","Now mark, the Godhead doth not dwell in Christ Jesus for Himself only, but that it may be in a way of righteousness conveyed to us, for our comfort and help in all our wants--""All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth,"" saith He (Matt 28:18).","And then followeth, ""And lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world"" (Verse 20).","""He hath received gifts for men, yea for the rebellious"" (Psa 68:18).","""Of His fullness have all we received, and grace for grace"" (John 1:16).","And this the saints cannot be deprived of, because the covenant made with Christ, in every tittle of it, was so completely fulfilled as to righteousness, both active and passive, that justice cannot object anything; holiness now can find fault with nothing; nay, all the power of God cannot shake anything that hath been done for us by the Mediator of the new covenant; so that now there is no Covenant of Works to a believer; none of the commands, accusations, condemnations, or the least tittle of the old covenant to be charged on any of those that are the children of the second covenant; no sin to be charged, because there is no law to be pleaded, but all is made up by our middle man, Jesus Christ.",O blessed covenant!,O blessed privilege!,"Be wise, therefore, O ye poor drooping souls that are the sons of this second covenant, and ""stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free, and be not entangled AGAIN,"" nor terrified in your consciences, ""with the yoke of bondage""; neither the commands, accusations, or condemnations of the Law of the old covenant (Gal 5:1).",Two Hell-bred objections answered.,Object.,"If it be so, then one need not care what they do; they may sin and sin again, seeing Christ hath made satisfaction.",[The first objection].,Answ.,"If I were to point out one that was under the power of the devil, and going post-haste to Hell, for my life I would look no farther for such a man than to him that would make such a use as this of the grace of God.","What, because Christ is a Saviour, thou wilt be a sinner!","because His grace abounds, therefore thou wilt abound in sin!",O wicked wretch!,"rake Hell all over, and surely I think thy fellow will scarce be found!","And let me tell thee this before I leave thee--as God's covenant with Christ for His children, which are of faith, stands sure, immutable, unrevocable, and unchangeable, so also hath God taken such a course with thee, that unless thou canst make God forswear Himself, it is impossible that thou shouldst go to Heaven, dying in that condition--""They tempted Me, proved Me,"" and turned the grace of God into lasciviousness, ""so I sware,"" mark that, ""so I sware,"" and that in My wrath, too, that they should never enter into My rest.","Compare Hebrews 3:9-11, with 1 Corinthians 10:5-10.","No, saith God; if Christ will not serve their turns, but they must have their sins too, take them, Devil; if Heaven will not satisfy them, take them, Hell; devour them, Hell; scald them, fry them, burn them, Hell!",God hath more places than one to put sinners into.,"If they do not like Heaven, He will fit them with Hell; if they do not like Christ, they shall be forced to have the devil.","Therefore we must and will tell of the truth of the nature of the Covenant of Grace of God to His poor saints for their encouragement and for their comfort, who would be glad to leap at Christ upon any terms; yet therewith, we can tell how, through grace, to tell the hogs and sons of this world what a hog-sty there is prepared for them, even such an one that God hath prepared to put the devil and his angels into, is fitly prepared for them (Matt 25:41).",Object.,"But if Christ hath given God a full and complete satisfaction, then though I do go on in sin, I need not fear, seeing God hath already been satisfied.",[The second objection].,It will be injustice in God to punish for those sins for which He is already satisfied for by Christ.,Answ.,"Rebel, rebel, there are some in Christ and some out of Him.",[1].,"They that are in Him have their sins forgiven, and they themselves made new creatures, and have the Spirit of the Son, which is a holy, living, self-denying Spirit.","And they that are thus in Jesus Christ are so far off from delighting in sin, that sin is the greatest thing that troubleth them; and O how willing would they be rid of the very thoughts of it (Psa 119:113).","It is the grief of their souls, when they are in a right frame of spirit, that they can live no more to the honour and glory of God than they do; and in all their prayers to God, the breathings of their souls are as much sanctifying grace as pardoning grace, that they might live a holy life.",They would as willing live holy here as they would be happy in the world to come; they would as willingly be cleansed from the filth of sin as to have the guilt of it taken away; they would as willingly glorify God here as they would be glorified by Him hereafter (Phil 3:6-22).,[2].,"But there are some that are out of Christ, being under the Law; and as for all those, let them be civil or profane, they are such as God accounts wicked; and I say, as for those, if all the angels in Heaven can drag them before the judgment-seat of Christ, they shall be brought before it to answer for all their ungodly deeds; and being condemned for them, if all the fire in Hell will burn them, they shall be burned there, if they die in that condition (Jude 15).","And, therefore, if you love your souls, do not give way to such a wicked spirit.","""Let no man deceive you with"" such ""vain words,"" as to think, because Christ hath made satisfaction to God for sin, therefore you may live in your sins.","O no, God forbid that any should think so, ""for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience"" (Eph 5:6).","Thus have I, reader, given thee a brief discourse touching the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace, also of the nature of the one, together with the nature of the other.","I have also in this discourse endeavoured to show you the condition of them that are under the Law, how sad it is, both from the nature of the covenant they are under, and also by the carriage of God unto them by that covenant.","And now, because I would bring all into as little a compass as I can, I shall begin with the use and application of the whole in as brief a way as I can, desiring the Lord to bless it to thee.",[USE AND APPLICATION].,A use of examination about the old covenant.,First.,"And, first of all, let us here begin to examine a little touching the covenant you stand before God in, whether it be the Covenant of Works or the Covenant of Grace; [The first use is a use of examination].","and for the right doing of this, I shall lay down this proposition--namely, that all men naturally come into the world under the first of these, which is called the old covenant, or the Covenant of Works, which is the Law; ""And were all by nature the children of wrath, even as others""; which they could not be, had they not been under the law; for there are none that are under the other covenant that are still the children of wrath, but the children of faith, the children of the promise, the accepted children, the children not of the bond-woman, but of the free (Gal 4:28-31).",[Quest.],Now here lieth the question.,"Which of these two covenants art thou under, soul?",Answ.,I hope I am under the Covenant of Grace.,Quest.,"But what ground hast thou to think that thou art under that blessed covenant, and not rather under the Covenant of Works, that strict, that soul-damning covenant?",Answ.,What ground?,"Why, I hope I am.",Quest.,But what ground hast thou for this thy hope?,"for a hope without a ground is like a castle built in the air, that will never be able to do thee any good, but will prove like unto that spoken of in Job 8, ""Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be"" like ""a spider's web.","He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; he shall hold it fast,"" as thou wouldst thy hope, it is like, ""but it shall not endure"" (Job 8:13-15).",Answ.,My hope is grounded upon the promises; what else should it be grounded upon?,Reply.,"Indeed, to build my hope upon Christ Jesus, upon God in Christ, through the promise, and to have this hope rightly, by the shedding abroad of the love of God in the heart, it is a right-grounded hope (Rom 5:1-7).",Quest.,But what promises in the Scripture do you find your hope built upon?,"and how do you know whether you do build your hope upon the promises in the Gospel, the promises of the new covenant, and not rather on the promises of the old covenant, for there are promises in that as well as in the other?",Answ.,I hope that if I do well I shall be accepted; because God hath said I shall (Gen 4:7).,Reply.,"O soul, if thy hope be grounded there, thy hope is not grounded upon the Gospel promises, or the new covenant, but verily upon the old; for these words were spoken to Cain, a son of the old covenant;

and do not make a slight examination, for thou hast a precious soul either to be saved or damned.","And that thou mayest not be deceived, consider that it is one thing to be convinced, and another to be converted; one thing to be wounded, and another to be killed, and so to be made alive again by the faith of Jesus Christ.","When men are killed, they are killed to all things they lived to before, both sin and righteousness, as all their old faith and supposed grace that they thought they had.","Indeed, the old covenant will show thee that thou art a sinner, and that a great one too; but the old covenant, the Law, will not show thee, without the help of the Spirit, that thou are without all grace by nature; no; but in the midst of thy troubles thou wilt keep thyself from coming to Christ by persuading thy soul that thou art come already, and hast some grace already.","O, therefore, be earnest in begging the Spirit, that thy soul may be enlightened, and the wickedness of thy heart discovered, that thou mayest see the miserable state that thou art in by reason of sin and unbelief, which is the great condemning sin; and so in a sight and sense of thy sad condition, if God should deal with thee in severity according to thy deservings.","Do thou [now] cry to God for faith in a crucified Christ, that thou mayest have all thy sins washed away in His blood, and such a right work of grace wrought in thy soul that may stand in the judgment-day.","Again, Second.","In the next place, you know I told you that a man might go a great way in a profession, and have many excellent gifts, [Second use].","so as to do many wondrous works, and yet be but under the Law;

for if they are blinded to this, both the right use of the law, and also of the Gospel, is hid from their eyes, and so for certain they will be in danger of perishing most miserably, poor souls that they are, unless God, of His mere mercy and love, doth rend the veil from off their hearts, the veil of ignorance, for that is it which doth keep these poor souls in this besotted and blindfolded condition, in which if they die they may be lamented for, but not helped; they may be pitied, but not preserved from the stoke of God's everlasting vengeance.",A legal spirit.,"In the next place, if you would indeed be delivered from the first into the second covenant, I do admonish you to the observing of these following particulars.",First.,"Have a care that you do not content yourselves, though you do good works--that is, which in themselves are good.",Secondly.,"In and with a legal spirit, which are done these ways as followeth.",First.,"If you do anything commanded in Scripture, and your doing of it do think that God is well pleased therewith, because you, as you are religious men, do do the same.","Upon this mistake was Paul himself in danger of being destroyed; for he thought, because he was zealous, and one of the strictest sects for religion, therefore God would have been good unto him, and have accepted his doings, as it is clear, for he counted them his gain (Phil 3:4-8).","Now this is done thus--When a man doth think that because he thinks he is more sincere, more liberal, with more difficulty, or to the weakening of his estate; I say, if a man, because of this doth think that God accepteth his labour, it is done from an old-covenant spirit.","Again; some men think that they shall be heard because they have prayer in their families, because they can pray long, and speak excellent expressions, or express themselves excellently in prayer, that because they have great enlargements in prayer, I say, that therefore to think that God doth delight in their doings, and accept their works, this is from a legal spirit.","Again; some men think that because their parents have been religious before them, and have been indeed the people of God, they think if they also do as to the outward observing of that which they learned from their forerunners, that therefore God doth accept them; but this also is from a wrong spirit; and yet how many are there in England at this day that think the better of themselves merely upon that account; ay, and think the people of God ought to think so too, not understanding that it is ordinary for an Eli to have a Hophni and a Phinehas, both sons of Belial; also a good Samuel to have a perverse offspring; likewise David an Absalom.","I say, their being ignorant of, or else negligent in regarding this, they do think that because they do spring from such and such, as the Jews in their generation did, that therefore they have a privilege with God more than others, when there is no such thing; but for certain, if the same faith be not in them which was in their forerunners, to lay hold of the Christ of God in the same spirit as they did, they must utterly perish, for all their high conceits that they have of themselves (John 8:33-35; Matt 3:7-9).",Second.,"When people come into the presence of God without having their eye upon the Divine Majesty, through the flesh and blood of the Son of Mary, the Son of God, then also do they come before God, and do whatsoever they do from a legal spirit, an old-covenant spirit.","As, for instance, you have some people, it is true, they will go to prayer, in appearance very fervently, and will plead very hard with God that He would grant them their desires, pleading their want, and the abundance thereof; they will also plead with God His great mercy, and also His free promises; but yet they neglecting the aforesaid body or Person of Christ, the righteous Lamb of God, to appear before Him in, I say, in thus doing they do not appear before the Lord no otherwise than in an old-covenant spirit; for they go to God as a merciful Creator, and they themselves as His creatures; not as He is, their Father in the Son, and they His children by regeneration through the Lord Jesus.","Ay, and though they may call God their Father, in the notion--not knowing what they say, only having learned such things by tradition--as the Pharisees did, yet Christ will have His time to say to them, even to their faces, as He did once to the Jews, Your father, for all this your profession, is the devil, to their own grief and everlasting misery (John 8:44).",Third.,"The third thing that is to be observed, if we would not be under the Law, or do things in a legal spirit, is this--to have a care that we do none of the works of the holy Law of God for life, or acceptance with Him; no, nor of the Gospel neither.","To do the works of the law to the end we may be accepted of God, or that we may please Him, and to have our desires of Him, is to do things from a legal or old-covenant spirit, and that is expressly laid down where it is said, ""To him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt""; that is, he appears before God through the Law, and his obedience to it (Rom 4:4,5).","And again, though they be in themselves Gospel-ordinances, as baptism, breaking of bread, hearing, praying, meditating, or the like; yet, I say, if they be not done in the right spirit, they are thereby used as a hand by the devil to pull thee under the Covenant of Works, as in former times he used circumcision, which was no part of the Covenant of Works, the Ten Commands, but a seal of the righteousness of faith; yet, I say, they being done in a legal spirit, the soul was thereby brought under the Covenant of Works, and so most miserably destroyed unawares to itself, and that because there was not a right understanding of the nature and terms of the said covenants.","And so it is now; souls being ignorant of the nature of the old covenant, do even by their subjecting to several Gospel ordinances, run themselves under the old covenant, and fly off from Christ, even when they think they are acoming closer to him.","O, miserable!","If you would know when or how this is done, whether in one particular or more, I shall show you as followeth-- 1.","That man doth bring himself under the Covenant of Works, by Gospel ordinances, when he cannot be persuaded that God will have mercy upon him except he do yield obedience to such or such a particular thing commanded in the Word.","This is the very same spirit that was in the false brethren (spoken of Acts 15; Galatians, the whole Epistle), whose judgment was, that unless such and such things were done, ""they could not be saved.""","As now-a-days we have also some that say, Unless your infants be baptized they cannot be saved;23 and others say, unless you be rightly baptized, you have no ground to be assured that you are believers, or members of churches; which is so far off from being so good as a legal spirit, that it is the spirit of blasphemy, as is evident, because they do reckon that the Spirit, righteousness, and faith of Jesus, and the confession thereof, is not sufficient to declare men to be members of the Lord Jesus; when, on the other side, though they be rank hypocrites, yet if they do yield an outward subjection to this or that, they are counted presently communicable members, which doth clearly discover that there is not so much honour given to the putting on the righteousness of the Son of God as there is given to that which a man may do, and yet go to Hell within an hour after; nay, in the very doing of it doth shut himself for ever from Jesus Christ.",2.,"Men may do things from a legal or old-covenant spirit when they content themselves with their doing of such and such a thing, as prayers, reading, hearing, baptism, breaking of bread, or the like; I say, when they can content themselves with the thing done, and sit down at ease and content because the thing is done.","As, for instance, some men being persuaded that such and such a thing is their duty, and that unless they do do it, God will not be pleased with them, nor suffer them to be heirs of His kingdom, they from this spirit do rush into and do the thing, which being done, they are content, as being persuaded that now they are without doubt in a happy condition, because they have done such things, like unto the Pharisee, who, because he had done this and the other thing, said therefore, in a bragging way, ""Lord, I thank thee that I am not as this publican""; for I have done thus and thus; when, alas!","the Lord give him never a good word for his labour, but rather a reproof.",3.,That man doth act from a legal spirit who maketh the strictness of his walking the ground of his assurance for eternal life.,"Some men, all the ground they have to believe that they shall be saved, it is because they walk not so loose as their neighbours, they are not so bad as others are, and therefore they question not but that they shall do well.","Now this is a false ground, and a thing that is verily legal, and savours only of some slight and shallow apprehensions of the old covenant.","I call them shallow apprehensions, because they are not right and sound, and are such as will do the soul no good, but beguile it, in that the knowledge of the nature of this covenant doth not appear to the soul, only some commanding power it hath on the soul, which the soul endeavouring to give up itself unto, it doth find some peace and content, and especially if it find itself to be pretty willing to yield itself to its commands.",And is not this the very ground of thy hoping that God will save thee from the wrath to come?,"If one should ask thee what ground thou hast to think thou shalt be saved, wouldst thou not say, Truly, because I have left my sins, and because I am more inclinable to do good, [Do not think that I am against the order of the Gospel].","and to learn, and get more knowledge; I endeavour to walk in church order, as they call it, and therefore I hope God hath done a good work for me, and I hope will save my soul.","Alas, alas!","this is a very trick of the devil to make souls build the ground of their salvation upon this their strictness, and abstaining from the wickedness of their former lives, and because they desire to be stricter and stricter.","Now, if you would know such a man or woman, you shall find them in this frame--namely, when they think their hearts are good, then they think also that Christ will have mercy upon them; but when their corruptions work, then they doubt and scruple until again they have their hearts more ready to do the things contained in the law and ordinances of the Gospel.","Again, such men do commonly cheer up their hearts, and encourage themselves still to hope all shall be well, and that because they are not so bad as the rest, but more inclinable than they, saying, I am glad I am not as this publican, but better than he, more righteous than he (Luke 18:11).",4.,"This is a legal and old-covenant spirit that secretly persuades the soul that if ever it will be saved by Christ, if must be fitted for Christ by its getting of a good heart and good intentions to do this and that for Christ; I say, that the soul when it comes to Christ may not be rejected or turned off; when in deed and in truth this is the very way for the soul to turn itself from Jesus Christ, instead of turning to Him; for such a soul looks upon Christ rather to be a painted Saviour or a cypher than a very and real Saviour.","Friend, if thou canst fit thyself, what need hast thou of Christ?","If thou cant get qualifications to carry to Christ that thou mightst be accepted, thou dost not look to be accepted in the Beloved.",Shall I tell thee?,"Thou art as if a man should say, I will make myself clean, and then I will go to Christ that He may wash me; or like a man possessed, that will first cast the devils out of himself, and then come to Christ for cure from Him.","Thou, must, therefore, if thou wilt so lay hold of Christ as not to be rejected by Him; I say, thou must come to Him as the basest in the world, more fit to be damned, if thou hadst thy right, than to have the least smile, hope, or comfort from Him.","Come with the fire of Hell in thy conscience, come with thy heart hard, dead, cold, full of wickedness and madness against thy own salvation; come as renouncing all thy tears, prayers, watchings, fastings; come as a blood-red sinner; do not stay from Christ till thou hast a greater sense of thy own misery, nor of the reality of God's mercy; do not stay while thy heart is softer and thy spirit in a better frame, but go against thy mind, and against the mind of the devil and sin, throw thyself down at the foot of Christ, with a halter about thy neck, and say, Lord Jesus, hear a sinner, a hard-hearted sinner, a sinner that deserveth to be damned, to be cast into Hell; and resolve never to return, or to give over crying unto Him, till thou do find that He hath washed thy conscience from dead works with His blood virtually, and clothed thee with His own righteousness, and make thee complete in Himself; this is the way to come to Christ.","THE USE OF THE NEW COVENANT Now a few words to the second doctrine, and so I shall draw towards a conclusion.",FIRST USE.,"The doctrine doth contain in it very much comfort to thy [The use, for the second doctrine].","soul who art a new-covenant man, or one of those who are under the new covenant.","There is, First, pardon of sin; and, Second, the manifestation of the same; and, Third, as power to cause thee to persevere through faith to the very end of thy life.","First, There is, first, pardon of sin, which is not in the old covenant; for in that there is nothing but commands; and if not obeyed, condemned.","O, but there is pardon of sin, even of all thy sins, against the first and second covenant, under which thou art, and that freely upon the account of Jesus Christ the righteousness, He having in thy name, nature, and in the room of thy person, fulfilled all the whole law in Himself for thee, and freely giveth it unto thee.","O, though the law be a ministration of death and condemnation, yet the Gospel, under which thou art, is the ministration of life and salvation (2 Cor 3:6-9).","Though they that live and die under the first covenant, God regardeth them not (Heb 8:9).",Yet they that are under the second are as the apple of His eye (Deu 32:10; Psa 17:8; Zech 2:8).,"Though they that are under the first, the Law, are ""called to blackness, and darkness, and tempest, the sound of a trumpet,"" and a burning mountain, which sight was so terrible, that Moses said, ""I exceedingly fear and quake"" (Heb 12:18-22).","""But ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn,"" whose names ""are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus,"" to blessed Jesus, ""the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel"" (Heb 12:22-24).",Even forgiveness of sins (Eph 1:7).,"Second, The covenant that thou art under doth allow of repentance in case thou chance to slip or fall by sudden temptation; but the law allows of none (Rev 2:5; Gal 3:10).","The covenant that thou art under allows thee strength also; but the law is only a sound of words, commanding words, but no power is given by them to fulfill the things commanded (Heb 12:19).","Thou that art under this second, art made a son; but they that art under that first, are slaves and vagabonds (Gen 4:12).","Thou that art under this, hast a Mediator, that is to stand between justice and thee; but they under the other, their mediator is turned an accuser, and speaketh most bitter things against their souls (1 Tim 2:5; John 5:45).","Again; the way that thou hast into Paradise is a new and living way--mark, a living way; but they that are under the old covenant, their way into Paradise is a killing and destroying way (Heb 10:20; Gen 3:24).","Again; thou has the righteousness of God to appear before God withal; but they under the old covenant have nothing but the righteousness of the Law, which Paul counts dirt and dung (Phil 3:7-9).","Thou hast that which will make thee perfect, but the other will not do so--""The law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did,"" which is the Son of God, ""by the which we draw nigh unto God"" (Heb 7:19).","Third, The new covenant promiseth thee a new heart, as I said before; but the old covenant promiseth none; and a new spirit, but the old covenant promiseth none (Eze 36:26).","The new covenant conveyeth faith, but the old one conveyeth none (Gal 3).",Through the new covenant the love of God is conveyed into the heart; but through the old covenant there is conveyed none of it savingly through Jesus Christ.,Romans 5.,"The new covenant doth not only give a promise of life, but also with that the assurance of life, but the old one giveth none; the old covenant wrought wrath in us and to us, but the new one worketh love (Rom 4:15; Gal 5:6).",Thus much for the first use.,SECOND USE.,"As all these, and many more privileges, do come to thee through or by the new covenant, and that thou mightst not doubt of the certainty of these glorious privileges, God hath so ordered it that they do all come to thee by way of purchase, being obtained for thee, ready to thy hand, by that one Man Jesus, who is the Mediator, or the Person that hath principally to do both with God and thy soul in the things pertaining to this covenant; so that now thou mayst look on all the glorious things that are spoken of in the new covenant, and say, All these must be mine; I must have a share in them; Christ hath purchased them for me, and given them to me.","Now I need not to say, O!",but how shall I come by them?,"God is holy, I am a sinner; God is just, and I have offended.","No; but thou mayst say, Though I am vile, and deserve nothing, yet Christ is holy, and He deserveth all things; though I have so provoked God by breaking His law that He could not in justice look upon me, yet Christ hath so gloriously paid the debt that now God can say, Welcome, soul, I will give thee grace, I will give thee glory, thou shalt lie in My bosom, and go no more out; My Son hath pleased Me, He hath satisfied the loud cries of the Law and justice, that called for speedy vengeance on thee; He hath fulfilled the whole Law, He hath brought in everlasting righteousness (Dan 9:24,25).","He hath overcome the devil, He hath washed away thy sins with His most precious blood, He hath destroyed the power of death, and triumphs over all the enemies.","This He did in His own Person, as a common Jesus, for all persons in their stead, even as for so many as shall come in to Him; for His victory I give to them, His righteousness I give to them, His merits I bestow on them, and look upon them holy, harmless, undefiled, and for ever comely in my eye, through the victory of the Captain of their salvation (1 Cor 15:55-57).","And that thou mayest, in deed and in truth, not only hear and read this glorious doctrine, but be found one that hath the life of it in thy heart, thou must be much in studying of the two covenants, the nature of the one, and the nature of the other, and the conditions of them that are under them both.","Also, thou must be well-grounded in the manner of the victory, and merits of Christ, how they are made thine.","First, And here thou must, in the first place, believe that the babe that was born of Mary, lay in a manger at Bethlehem, in the time of Caesar Augustus; that He, that babe, that child, was the very Christ.","Second, Thou must believe that in the days of Tiberius Caesar, when Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and Pontius Pilate governor of Judea, that in those days He was crucified, or hanged on a tree between two thieves, which by computation, or according to the best account, is above sixteen hundred years since.","24 Third, Thou must also believe that when He did hang upon that cross of wood on the Mount Calvary, that then He did die there for the sins of those that did die before He was crucified; also for their sins that were alive at the time of His crucifying, and also that He did by that one death give satisfaction to God for all those that should be born and believe in Him after His death, even unto the world's end.","I say, this thou must believe, upon pain of eternal damnation, that by that one death, that when He did die, He did put an end to the curse of the Law and sin [This is the doctrine that I will live and die by, and be willing to be damned if it saves me not.","I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation; therefore I preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness (Rom 1:16; 1 Cor 1:23).]","and at that time by His death on the Cross, and by His resurrection out of Joseph's sepulchre, He did bring in a sufficient righteousness to clothe thee withal completely--""For by one offering He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.""","Not that He should often offer Himself--""for then must He often have suffered since the foundation of the world; but now ONCE in the end of the world hath He appeared to put,"" or do, ""away sin by the sacrifice of Himself""--namely, when He hanged on the Cross.",For it is by the offering up of the body of this blessed Jesus Christ ONCE for all.,"Indeed, other priests may offer oftentimes sacrifices and offerings which can never take away sins; but this Man, this Jesus, this anointed and appointed sacrifice, when He had offered ONE sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of God (Heb 10:14; 9:24,25).",[A word of advice].,"But because thou in thy pursuit after the faith of the Gospel wilt be sure to meet with devils, heretics, particular corruptions, as unbelief, ignorance, the spirit of works animated on by suggestions, false conclusions, with damnable doctrines, I shall therefore briefly, besides what hath been already said, speak a word or two before I leave thee of further advice, especially concerning these two things.","First, How thou art to conceive of the Saviour.","Second, How thou art to make application of Him.",First.,For the Saviour.,1.,"Thou must look upon Him to be very God and very Man; not man only, nor God only, but God and Man in one Person, both natures joined together, for the putting of Him in a capacity to be a suitable Saviour; suitable, I say, to answer both sides and parties, with whom He hath to do in the office of His Mediatorship and being of a Saviour.",2.,"Thou must not only do this, but thou must also consider and believe that even what was done by Jesus Christ, it was not done by one nature without the other; but thou must consider that both natures, both the Godhead and the manhood, did gloriously concur and join together in the undertaking of the salvation of our bodies and souls; not that the Godhead undertook anything without the manhood, neither did the manhood do anything without the virtue and union of the Godhead; and thou must of necessity do this, otherwise thou canst not find any sound ground and footing for thy soul to rest upon.","For if thou look upon any of these asunder--that is to say, the Godhead without the manhood, or the manhood without the Godhead--thou wilt conclude that what was done by the Godhead was not done for man, being done without the manhood; or else, that that which was done with the manhood could not answer Divine justice, in not doing what it did by the virtue and in union with the Godhead; for it was the Godhead that gave virtue and value to the suffering of the manhood, and the manhood being joined therewith, that giveth us an interest into the heavenly glory and comforts of the Godhead.","What ground can a man have to believe that Christ is his Saviour, if he do not believe that He suffered for sin in his nature?","And what ground also can a man have to think that God the Father is satisfied, being infinite, if he believe not also that He who gave the satisfaction was equal to Him who was offended?","Therefore, beloved, when you read of the offering of the body of the Son of Man for our sins, then consider that He did it in union with, and by the help of, the eternal Godhead.","""How much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through the eternal Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God, purge your consciences from dead works,"" etc.","And when thou readest of the glorious works and splendour of the Godhead in Christ, then consider that all that was done by the Godhead, it was done as it had union and communion with the manhood.","And then thou shalt see that the devil is overcome by God-man; sin, death, Hell, the grave, and all overcome by Jesus, God-man, and then thou shalt find them overcome indeed.","They must needs be overcome when God doth overcome them; and we have good ground to hope the victory is ours, when in our nature they are overcome.",Second.,"The second thing is, how to apply, or to make application of this Christ to the soul.",And for this there are to be considered the following particulars-- 1.,"That when Jesus Christ did thus appear, being born of Mary, He was looked upon by the Father as if the sin of the whole world was upon Him; nay, further, God did look upon Him and account Him the sin of man--""He hath made Him to be sin for us,"" (2 Cor 5:21) that is, God made His Son Jesus Christ our sin, or reckoned Him to be, not only a sinner, but the very bulk of sin of the whole world, and condemned Him so severely as if He had been nothing but sin.","""For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh""--that is, for our sins condemned His Son Jesus Christ; as if He had in deed and truth been our very sin, although altogether ""without sin"" (Rom 8:3; 2 Cor 5:21).","Therefore, as to the taking away of thy curse, thou must reckon Him to be made sin for thee.","And as to His being thy justification, thou must reckon Him to be thy righteousness; for, saith the Scripture, ""He,"" that is, God, ""hath made HIM to be SIN for us, though He knew no sin, that we might be made the RIGHTEOUSNESS of God in HIM.""",2.,"Consider for whose sakes all this glorious design of the Father and the Son was brought to pass; and that you shall find to be for man, for sinful man (2 Cor 8:9).",3.,"The terms on which it is made ours; and that you will find to be a free gift, merely arising from the tender-heartedness of God--you are ""justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ, whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation through faith in His blood,"" etc.",(Rom 3:25).,4.,"How men are to reckon it theirs; and that is, upon the same terms which God doth offer it, which is freely, as they are worthless and undeserving creatures, as they are without all good, and also unable to do any good.","This, I say, is the right way of applying the merits of Christ to thy soul, for they are freely given to thee, a poor sinner, not for anything that is in thee, or done by thee, but freely as thou art a sinner, and so standest in absolute need thereof.","And, Christian, thou art not in this thing to follow thy sense and feeling, but the very Word of God.","The thing that doth do the people of God the greatest injury, it is their too little hearkening to what the Gospel saith, and their too much giving credit to what the Law, sin, the devil, and conscience saith; and upon this very ground to conclude that because there is a certainty of guilt upon the soul, therefore there is also for certain, by sin, damnation to be brought upon the soul.","This is now to set the Word of God aside, and to give credit to what is formed by the contrary; but thou must give more credit to one syllable of the written Word of the Gospel than thou must give to all the saints and angels in Heaven and earth; much more than to the devil and thy own guilty conscience.","Let me give you a parable:--There was a certain man that had committed treason against his king; but forasmuch as the king had compassion upon him, he sent him, by the hand of a faithful messenger, a pardon under his own hand and seal; but in the country where this poor man dwelt, there were also many that sought to trouble him, by often putting of him in mind of his treason, and the law that was to be executed on the offender.","Now which way should this man so honour his king, but as by believing his handwriting, which was the pardon.",Certainly he would honour him more by so doing than to regard all the clamours of his enemies continually against him.,"Just thus it is here: thou having committed treason against the King of Heaven, He through compassion, for Christ's sake, hath sent thee a pardon; but the devil, the Law, and thy conscience do continually seek to disturb thee by bringing thy sins afresh into thy remembrance.","But now, wouldst thou honour thy King?","Why then, he that believeth ""the record that God hath given of His Son,"" hath set to his seal that God is true.","""And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son"" (1 John 5:11).","And therefore, my brethren, seeing God our Father hath sent us damnable traitors a pardon from Heaven, even all the promises of the Gospel, and also hath sealed to the certainty of it with the heart-blood of His dear Son, let us not be daunted, though our enemies, with terrible voices, do bring our former life never so often into our remembrance.",Object.,"But, saith the soul, how, if after I have received a pardon, I should commit treason again?",What should I do then?,Answ.,"Set the case: thou hast committed abundance of treason, He hath by Him abundance of pardons--""Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon"" (Isa 55:7).","Sometimes I myself have been in such a strait that I have been almost driven to my wit's ends with the sight and sense of the greatness of my sins; but calling to mind that God was God in His mercy, pity, and love, as well as in His holiness, justice, etc.","; and again, considering the ability of the satisfaction that was given to holiness and justice, to the end there might be way made for sinners to lay hold of this mercy; I say, I considering this, when tempted to doubt and despair, I have answered in this manner-- ""Lord, here is one of the greatest sinners that ever the ground bare; a sinner against the Law, and a sinner against the Gospel.","I have sinned against light, and I have sinned against mercy.","And now, Lord, the guilt of them breaks my heart.","The devil also he would have me despair, telling of me that Thou art so far from hearing my prayers in this my distress, that I cannot anger Thee worse than to call upon Thee; for saith he, Thou art resolved for ever to damn, and not to grant me the least of Thy favour; yet, Lord, I would fain have forgiveness.","And Thy Word, though much may be inferred from it against me, yet it saith, If I come unto Thee, Thou will in nowise cast me out.","Lord, shall I honour Thee most by believing Thou canst pardon my sins, or by believing Thou canst not?","Shall I honour Thee most by believing Thou wilt pardon my sins, or by believing Thou wilt not?","Shall I honour the blood of Thy Son also by despairing that the virtue thereof is not sufficient, or by believing that it is sufficient to purge me from all my blood-red and crimson sins?","Surely, Thou that couldst find so much mercy as to pardon Manasseh, Mary Magdalene, the three thousand murderers, persecuting Paul, murderous and adulterous David, and blaspheming Peter--Thou that offeredst mercy to Simon Magus, a witch, and didst receive the astrologers and conjurors in the 19th of Acts--Thou hast mercy enough for one poor sinner.","Lord, set the case: my sins were bigger than all these, and I less deserved mercy than any of these, yet Thou hast said in Thy Word that he that cometh to thee Thou wilt in ""nowise cast out.""","And God hath given comfort to my soul, even to such a sinner as I am.","And I tell you, there is no way so to honour God, and to beat out the devil, as to stick to the truth of God's Word and the merits of Christ's blood by believing.",When Abraham believed--even against hope and reason--he gave glory to God (Rom 4).,"And this is our victory, even our faith (1 John 5:4).","Believe, and all things are possible to you.",He that believeth shall be saved.,"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, and shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of Christ's Father's hands.""","And if thou dost indeed believe this, thou wilt not only confess Him as the Quakers do--that is, that He was born at Bethlehem of Mary, suffered on Mount Calvary under Pontius Pilate, was dead and buried, rose again, and ascended, etc.","; for all this they confess, and in the midst of their confession they do verily deny that His death on that Mount Calvary did give satisfaction to God for the sins of the world, and that His resurrection out of Joseph's sepulchre is the cause of our justification in the sight of God, angels, and devils; but, I say, if thou dost believe these things indeed, thou dost believe that then, so long ago, even before thou wast born, He did bear thy sins in His own body, which then was hanged on the tree, and never before nor since; that thy old man was then crucified with Him, namely, in the same body then crucified (See 1 Peter 2:24; and Rom 6:6).","This is nonsense to them that believe not; but if thou do indeed believe, thou seest it so plain, and yet such a mystery, that it makes thee wonder.","But, [THIRD USE].","In the third place, this glorious doctrine of the new covenant, and the Mediator thereof, will serve for the comforting, and the maintaining of the comfort, of the children of the new covenant this way also--that is, that He did not only die and rise again, but that He did ascend in His own Person into Heaven to take possession thereof for me, to prepare a place there for me, standeth there in the second part of His suretyship to bring me safe in my coming thither, and to present me in a glorious manner, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; that He is there exercising of His priestly office for me, pleading the perfection of His own righteousness for me, and the virtue of His blood for me; that He is there ready to answer the accusations of the Law, devil, and sin for me.","Here thou mayst through faith look the very devil in the face, and rejoice, saying, O Satan!","I have a precious Jesus, a soul-comforting Jesus, a sin-pardoning Jesus.","Here thou mayst hear the biggest thunder-crack that the Law can give, and yet not be daunted.","Here thou mayst say, O Law!","thou mayst roar against sin, but thou canst not reach me; thou mayst curse and condemn, but not my soul; for I have righteous Jesus, a holy Jesus, a soul-saving Jesus, and He hath delivered me from thy threats, from thy curses, from thy condemnations; I am out of thy reach, and out of thy bounds; I am brought into another covenant, under better promises, promises of life and salvation, free promises to comfort me without my merit, even through the blood of Jesus, the satisfaction given to God for me by Him; therefore, though thou layest my sins to my charge, and sayest thou wilt prove me guilty, yet so long as Christ is above ground, and hath brought in everlasting righteousness, and given that to me, I shall not fear thy threats, thy charges, thy soul-scarring denunciations; my Christ is all, hath done all, and will deliver me from all that thou, and whatsoever else can bring an accusation against me.","Thus also thou may say when death assaulteth thee--O death, where is thy sting?","Thou mayst bite indeed, but thou canst not devour; I have comfort by and through the one Man Jesus; Jesus Christ, He hath taken thee captive, and taken away thy strength; He hath pierced thy heart, and let out all thy soul-destroying poison; therefore, though I see thee, I am not afraid of thee; though I feel thee, I am not daunted; for thou hast lost thy sting in the side of the Lord Jesus; through Him I overcome thee, and set foot upon thee.","Also, O Satan!","though I hear thee grumble, and make a hellish noise, and though thou threaten me very highly, yet my soul shall triumph over thee, so long as Christ is alive and can be heard in Heaven; so long as He hath broken thy head, and won the field of thee; so long as thou are in prison, and canst not have thy desire.","I, therefore, when I hear thy voice, do pitch my thoughts on Christ my Saviour, and do hearken when He will say, for He will speak comfort; He saith, He hath got the victory, and doth give to me the crown, and causeth me to triumph through His most glorious conquest.","Nay, my brethren, the saints under the Levitical Law, who had not the new covenant sealed or confirmed any further than by promise that it should be; I say, they, when they thought of the glorious privileges that God had promised should come, though at that time they were not come, but seen afar off, how confidently were they persuaded of them, and embraced them, and were so fully satisfied as touching the certainty of them, that they did not stick at the parting with all for the enjoying of them.",[Shall not we then that see all things already done before us make it a strong argument to increase our faith (Heb 11).],"How many times doth David in the Psalms admire, triumph, and persuade others to do so also, through the faith that he had in the thing that was to be done?","Also Job, in what faith doth he say he should see his Redeemer, though He had not then shed one drop of blood for him, yet because He had promised so to do; and this was signified by the blood of bulls and goats.","Also Samuel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Zechariah, etc., how gloriously in confidence did they speak of Christ, and His death, blood, conquest, and everlasting priesthood, even before He did manifest Himself in the flesh which He took of the Virgin.","[For they were so many sure promises, with a remembrance in them, also for the better satisfaction of them that believed them].","We that have lived since Christ, have more ground to hope than they under the old covenant had, though they had the word of the just God for the ground of their faith.","Mark, they had only the promise that He should and would come; but we have the assured fulfilling of those promises, because He is come; they were told that He should spill His blood, but we do see He hath spilt His blood; they ventured all upon His standing Surety for them, but we see He hath fulfilled, and that faithfully too, the office of His Suretyship, in that, according to the engagement, He hath redeemed us poor sinners; they ventured on the new covenant, though not actually sealed, only ""because He judged Him faithful who had promised"" (Heb 11:11).","But we have the covenant sealed, all things are completely done, even as sure as the heart-blood of a crucified Jesus can make it.","There is a great difference between their dispensation and ours for comfort, even as much as there is between the making of a bond with a promise to seal it, and the sealing of the same.","It was made indeed in their time, but it was not sealed until the time the blood was shed on the Mount Calvary; and that we might indeed have our faith mount up with wings like an eagle, he showeth us what encouragement and ground of faith we have to conclude we shall be everlastingly delivered, saying, ""For where a testament"" or covenant ""is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.",For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.,"Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood"" (Heb 9:16-18).","As Christ's blood was the confirmation of the new covenant, yet it was not sealed in Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob's days to confirm the covenant that God did tell them of, and yet they believed; therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to believe the things that we have heard, and not in any wise to let them be questioned; and the rather, because you see the testament is not only now made, but confirmed; not only spoken of and promised, but verily sealed by the death and blood of Jesus, who is the Testator thereof.","My brethren, I would not leave you ignorant of this one thing, that though the Jews had the promise of a sacrifice, of an everlasting High Priest that should deliver them, yet they had but the promise; for Christ was not sacrificed, and was not then come a high priest of good things to come; only the type, the shadow, the figure, the ceremonies they had, together with Christ's engaging as Surety to bring all things to pass that were promised should come, and upon that account received and saved.","It was with them and their dispensation as this similitude gives you to understand:--Set the case that there be two men who make a covenant that the one should give the other ten thousand sheep on condition the other give him two thousand pound; but forasmuch as the money is not to be paid down presently, therefore if he that buyeth the sheep will have any of them before the day of payment, the creditor requesteth a surety; and upon the engagement of the surety there is part of the sheep given to the debtor even before the day of payment, but the other at and after.","So it is here; Christ covenanted with His Father for His sheep--""I lay down My life for My sheep,"" saith He--but the money was not to be paid down so soon as the bargain was made, as I have already said, yet some of the sheep were saved even before the money was paid, and that because of the Suretyship of Christ; as it is written, ""Being justified,"" or saved, ""freely by His grace through the redemption,"" or purchase, ""that is in Christ Jesus.","Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past,"" or the sinners who died in the faith before Christ was crucified, through God's forbearing till the payment was paid; to declare, I say, at this time His righteousness; ""that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus"" (Rom 3:24-26).","The end of my speaking of this is, to show you that it is not wisdom now to doubt whether God will save you or no, but to believe, because all things are finished as to our justification: the covenant not only made, but also sealed; the debt paid, the prison doors flung off of the hooks, with a proclamation from Heaven of deliverance to the prisoners of hope, saying, ""Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope, even today do I declare,"" saith God, ""that I will render double unto thee"" (Zech 9:12).","And, saith Christ, when He was come, ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed Me to preach the Gospel,"" that is, good tidings ""to the poor,"" that their sins should be pardoned, that their souls shall be saved.","""He hath sent Me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,"" and to comfort them that mourn, ""to preach the acceptable year of the Lord"" (Luke 4:18,19).","Therefore here, soul, thou mayst come to Jesus Christ for anything thou wantest, as to a common treasure-house, being the principal Man for the distributing of the things made mention of in the new covenant, He having them all in His own custody by right of purchase; for He hath bought them all, paid for them all.",Dost thou want faith?,then come for it to the Man Christ Jesus (Heb 12:2).,Dost thou want the Spirit?,then ask it of Jesus.,Dost thou want wisdom?,Dost thou want grace of any sort?,Dost thou want a new heart?,"Dost thou want strength against thy lusts, against the devil's temptations?","Dost thou want strength to carry thee through afflictions of body, and afflictions of spirit, through persecutions?","Wouldst thou willingly hold out, stand to the last, and be more than a conqueror?","then be sure thou meditate enough on the merits of the blood of Jesus, how He hath undertaken for thee, that He hath done the work of thy salvation in thy room, that He is filled of God on purpose to fill thee, and is willing to communicate whatsoever is in Him or about Him to thee.","Consider this, I say, and triumph in it.","Again; this may inform us of the safe state of the saints as touching their perseverance, that they shall stand though Hell rages, though the devil roareth, and all the world endeavoureth the ruin of the saints of God, though some, through ignorance of the virtue of the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, do say a man may be a child of God today, and a child of the devil tomorrow, which is gross ignorance; for what?","Is the blood of Christ, the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, of no more virtue than to bring in for us an uncertain salvation?","or must the effectualness of Christ's merits, as touching our perseverance, be helped on by the doings of man?","Surely they that are predestinated are also justified;

who hath also given unto us His Holy Spirit"" (1 Thessalonians 4:8); that is, he rejecteth or despiseth the very testimony of the Spirit.",5.,"It is called the sin against the Holy Ghost, because he that doth reject and disown the doctrine of salvation by the Man Christ Jesus, through believing in Him, doth despise, resist, and reject the wisdom of the Spirit; for the wisdom of God's Spirit did never more appear than its finding out a way for sinners to be reconciled to God by the death of this Man; and therefore Christ, as He is a sacrifice, is called the wisdom of God.","And again, when it doth reveal the Lord Jesus it is called the ""Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him"" (Eph 1:17).",Object.,"But, some may say, the slighting or rejecting of the Son of Man, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Mary, cannot be the sin that is unpardonable, as is clear from that Scripture in Matthew 12:32, where He Himself saith, ""Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him;

I say, he that shall after this knowingly, willfully, and out of malice and despite reject, speak against, and trample that doctrine under foot, resolving for ever so to do, and if he there continue, I will pawn my soul upon it, he hath sinned the unpardonable sin, and shall never be forgiven, neither in this world, nor in the world to come; or else these Scriptures that testify the truth of this must be scrabbled out, and must be looked upon for mere fables, which are these following--""For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,"" which is the Son of Man (Matt 16:13) ""and are again entangled therein, and overcome,"" which must be by denying this Lord that brought them (2 Peter 2:1) ""the latter end is worse with them than the beginning,"" (2 Peter 2:20).","For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift--and have tasted the good Word of God, and the powers of the world to come;

for this sin is immediately committed against the motions, and convictions, and light of the Holy Spirit of God that makes it its business to hand forth and manifest the truth and reality of the merits and virtues of the Lord Jesus, the Son of Man.","And therefore beware, Ranters and Quakers, for I am sure you are the nearest that sin by profession, which is, indeed, the right committing of it, of any persons that I do know at this day under the whole heavens, forasmuch as you will not venture the salvation of your souls on the blood shed on Mount Calvary, out of the side of that Man that was offered up in sacrifice for all that did believe (Luke 23:33).","In that His offering up of His body at that time, either before He offered it, or that have, do, or shall believe on it for the time since, together with that time that He offered it, though formerly you did profess that salvation was wrought out that way, by that sacrifice then offered, and also seemed to have some comfort thereby; yea, insomuch that some of you declared the same in the hearing of many, professing yourselves to be believers of the same.","O, therefore, it is sad for you that were once enlightened, and have tasted these good things, and yet, notwithstanding all your profession, you are now turned from the simplicity that is in Christ to another doctrine, which will be your destruction, if you continue in it; for without blood there is no remission (Heb 9:22).","Many other reasons might be given, but that I would not be too tedious; yet I would put in this caution, that if there be any souls that be but now willing to venture their salvation upon the merits of a naked Jesus, I do verily for the present believe they have not sinned that sin, because there is still a promise holds forth itself to such a soul where Christ saith, ""Him that cometh to me, I will in nowise,"" for nothing that he hath done, ""cast him out"" (John 6:37).",That promise is worth to be written in letters of gold.,Objections answered for their comfort who would have their part in the New Covenant.,Object.,"But, alas, though I should never sin that sin, yet I have other sins enough to damn me.",Answ.,"What though thou hadst the sins of a thousand sinners, yet if thou come to Christ, He will save thee (John 6:37;

that is, out of deep or great afflictions, and said, 'Lord, hear my voice, let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.'","The latter words explain the former; as who should say, By voice I mean the meaning and spirit of my prayer.","There are words in prayer, and spirit in prayer, and by the spirit that is in prayer, is discerned whether the words be dead, lifeless, feigned, or warm, fervent, earnest; and God who searcheth the heart, knoweth the meaning of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God (Rom 8:27).",Verse 3.,"'If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?'","Here he confesseth, that all men by the law must fall before God for ever; for that they have broken it, but cannot make amends for the transgression thereof.","But, he quickly bethinking himself of the mercy of God in Christ, he saith, verse 4, 'But there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared.'","Then he returns, saying, verse 5, 'I wait for the Lord,' that is, in all his appointments; yea, he doubleth it, saying, 'My soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.'","By which repetition he insinuates, that many are content to give their bodily presence to God in his appointments, while their hearts were roving to the ends of the earth; but for his part he did not so.",Verse 6.,"'My soul waiteth for the Lord, more than they that watch for the morning, I say, more than they that watch for the morning.'","As who should say, even as it is with those that are tired with the night, either by reason of dark or wearisome journies, or because of tedious sickness, to whom the night is most doleful and uncomfortable, waiting for spring of day; so wait I for the Lord, that his presence might be with my soul.","So and more too I say, 'More than they that wait for the morning.'","Then he comes to the words which I have chosen for my text, saying, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.'","In which words we have, FIRST, AN EXHORTATION; SECOND, A REASON OF THAT EXHORTATION; and THIRD, AN AMPLIFICATION OF THAT REASON.",'Let Israel hope in the Lord'; there is the exhortation; 'For with the Lord there is mercy'; there is the reason of it; 'And with him is plenteous redemption'; there is the amplification of that reason.,[FIRST.,AN EXHORTATION.],In the exhortation there are three things to be inquired into.,"FIRST, The matter contained in it; SECOND, The manner by which it is expressed; THIRD, The inferences that do naturally flow therefrom.",[FIRST.,The matter contained in the exhortation.],"We will speak first to the matter contained in the text, and that presenteth itself unto us under three heads.","First, A duty.","Second, A direction for the well management of that duty.","Third, The persons that are so to manage it.","First, Then, to speak to the duty, and that is HOPE; 'Let Israel HOPE.'","By which word there is something pre-admitted, and something of great concern insinuated.","That which is pre-admitted is faith; for when we speak properly of hope, and put others distinctly to the duty of hoping, we conclude that such have faith already; for no faith, no hope.","To hope without faith, is to see without eyes, or to expect without a ground: for 'Faith is the substance of things hoped for,' as well with respect to the grace, as to the doctrine of faith (Heb 11:1).",Doth such a one believe?,No.,Doth he hope?,Yes.,"If the first is true, the second is a lie; he that never believed, did never hope in the Lord.","Wherefore, when he saith, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord,' he pre-supposeth faith, and signifieth that he speaketh to believers.","That which is of great concern insinuated, is, that hope has in it an excellent quality to support Israel in all its troubles.","Faith has its excellency in this, hope in that, and love in another thing.",Faith will do that which hope cannot do.,"Hope can do that which faith doth not do, and love can do things distinct from both their doings.","Faith goes in the van, hope in the body, and love brings up the rear: and thus 'now abideth faith, hope,' and 'charity' (1 Cor 13:13).","Faith is the mother-grace, for hope is born of her, but charity floweth from them both.","But a little, now we are upon faith and hope distinctly, to let you see a little.",1.,"Faith comes by hearing (Rom 10:17), hope by experience (Rom 5:3,4).",2.,"Faith comes by hearing the Word of God, hope by the credit that faith hath given to it (Rom 4:18).",3.,"Faith believeth the truth of the Word, hope waits for the fulfilling of it.",4.,"Faith lays hold of that end of the promise that is next to us, to wit, as it is in the Bible; hope lays hold of that end of the promise that is fastened to the mercy-seat; for the promise is like a mighty cable, that is fastened by one end to a ship, and by the other to the anchor: the soul is the ship where faith is, and to which the hither[2] end of this cable is fastened; but hope is the anchor that is at the other end of this cable, and which entereth into that within the vail.","Thus faith and hope getting hold of both ends of the promise, they carry it safely all away.",5.,"Faith looketh to Christ, as dead, buried, and ascended; and hope to his second coming (1 Cor 15:1-4).","Faith looks to him for justification, hope for glory (Rom 4:1-8).",6.,"Faith fights for doctrine, hope for a reward (Acts 26:6,7).","Faith for what is in the bible, hope for what is in heaven (Col 1:3-5).",7.,"Faith purifies the heart from bad principles (1 John 5:4,5).","Hope from bad manners (2 Peter 3:11,14; Eph 5:8; 1 John 3:3).",8.,"Faith sets hope on work, hope sets patience on work (Acts 28:20, 9:9).","Faith says to hope, look for what is promised; hope says to faith, So I do, and will wait for it too.",9.,Faith looks through the word to God in Christ; hope looks through faith beyond the world to glory (Gal 5:5).,"Thus faith saves, and thus hope saves.",Faith saves by laying hold of God by Christ (1 Peter 1:5).,"Hope saves by prevailing with the soul to suffer all troubles, afflictions, and adversities that it meets with betwixt this and the world to come, for the sake thereof (Rom 8:24).",Take the matter in this plain similitude.,"There was a king that adopted such a one to be his child, and clothed him with the attire of the children of the king, and promised him, that if he would fight his father's battles, and walk in his father's ways, he should at last share in his father's kingdoms.","He has received the adoption, and the king's robe, but not yet his part in the kingdom; but now, hope of a share in that will make him fight the king's battles, and also tread the king's paths.","Yea, and though he should meet with many things that have a tendency to deter him from so doing, yet thoughts of the interest promised in the kingdom, and hopes to enjoy it, will make him out his way through those difficulties, and so save him from the ruin that those destructions would bring upon him, and will, in conclusion, usher him into a personal possession and enjoyment of that inheritance.","Hope has a thick skin, and will endure many a blow; it will put on patience as a vestment, it will wade through a sea of blood, it will endure all things, if it be of the right kind, for the joy that is set before it.","Hence patience is called, 'Patience of hope,' because it is hope that makes the soul exercise patience and long-suffering under the cross, until the time comes to enjoy the crown (1 Thess 1:3).","The Psalmist, therefore, by this exhortation, persuadeth them that have believed the truth, to wait for the accomplishment of it, as by his own example he did himself--'I wait for the Lord,' 'my soul waiteth,' 'and in his word do I hope.'","It is for want of hope that so many brisk professors that have so boasted and made brags of their faith, have not been able to endure the drum[3] in the day of alarm and affliction.","Their hope in Christ has been such as has extended itself no further than to this life, and therefore they are of all men the most miserable.","The Psalmist therefore, by exhorting us unto this duty, doth put us in mind of four things.",I.,"That the best things are yet behind, and in reversion for the saints.",II.,"That those that have believed, will yet meet with difficulties before they come at them.",III.,"The grace of hope well exercised, is the only way to overcome these difficulties.",IV.,"They therefore that have hope, and do exercise it as they should, shall assuredly at last enjoy that hope that is laid up for them in heaven.",I.,"For the first of these, that the best things are yet behind, and in reversion for believers; this is manifest by the natural exercise of this grace.","For 'hope that is seen, is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?","But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it' (Rom 8:24,25).","Hope lives not by sight, as faith doth; but hope trusteth faith, as faith trusts the Word, and so bears up the soul in a patient expectation at last to enjoy what God has promised.","But I say, the very natural work of this grace proveth, that the believer's best things are behind in reversion.","You may ask me, what those things are?","and I may tell you, first, in general, they are heavenly things, they are eternal things, they are the things that are where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God (John 3:12; 2 Cor 4:18; Col 3:1).",Do you know them now?,"They are things that 'eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor that have entered into the heart of man to conceive of' (Isa 64:4; 1 Cor 2:9).",Do you know them now?,"They are things that are referred to the next world, for the saints when they come into the next world; talked of they may be now, the real being of them may be believed now, and by hope we may, and it will be our wisdom to wait for them now; but to know what they are in the nature of them, or in the enjoyment of them, otherwise than by faith, he is deceived that saith it.","They are things too big as yet to enter into our hearts, and things too big, if they were there to come out, or to be expressed by our mouths.","There is heaven itself, the imperial heaven; does any body know what that is?","There is the mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, and the innumerable company of angels; doth any body know what all they are?",There is immortality and eternal life: and who knows what they are?,"There are rewards for services, and labour of love showed to God's name here; and who knows what they will be?","There are mansion-houses, beds of glory, and places to walk in among the angels; and who knows what they are?","There will be badges of honour, harps to make merry with, and heavenly songs of triumph; doth any here know what they are?","There will be then a knowing, an enjoying and a solacing of ourselves with prophets, apostles, and martyrs, and all saints; but in what glorious manner we all are ignorant of.","There we shall see and know, and be with for ever, all our relations, as wife, husband, child, father, mother, brother, or sister that have died in the faith; but how gloriously they will look when we shall see them, and how gloriously we shall love when we are with them, it is not for us in this world to know (1 Thess 4:16,17).","There are thoughts, and words, and ways for us, which we never dreamed on in this world.","The law was but the shadow, the gospel the image; but what will be the substance that comes to us next, or that rather we shall go unto, who can understand?",(Heb 10:1).,"If we never saw God nor Christ as glorified, nor the Spirit of the Lord, nor the bottom of the Bible, nor yet so much as one of the days of eternity,, and yet all these things we shall see and have them, how can it be that the things laid up for us, that should be the object of our hope, should by us be understood in this world?",Yet there are intimations given us of the goodness and greatness of them.,[4] 1.,"Of their goodness, and that, (1.)","In that the Holy Ghost scorns that things that are here should once be compared with them; hence all things here are called vanities, nothings, less than nothings (Isa 40:15-17).","Now, if the things, all the things that are here, are so contemptuously considered, when compared with the things that are to be hereafter, and yet these things so great in the carnal man's esteem, as that he is willing to venture life and soul, and all to have them, what are the things that God has prepared for them that wait, that is, that hope for him?",(2.),"Their goodness also appears in this, that whoever has had that understanding of them, as is revealed in the Word, whether king or beggar, wise mean or fool, he has willingly cast this world behind him in contempt and scorn, for the hope of that (Psa 73:25; Heb 11:24-26, 37-40).",(3.),The goodness of them has even testimony in the very consciences of them that hate them.,"Take the vilest man in the country, the man who is so wedded to his lusts, that he will rather run the hazard of a thousand hells than leave them; and ask this man his judgment of the things of the next world, and he will shake his head, and say, They are good, they are best of all.",(4.),"But the saints have the best apprehension of their goodness, for that the Lord doth sometimes drop some of the juice of them out of the Word, into their hungry souls.",2.,"But as they are good, so they are great: 'O how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, which thou hast wrought for them that trust,' that hope, 'in thee before the sons of men!'",(Psa 31:19).,(1.),"Their greatness appears, in that they go beyond the Word; yea, beyond the word of the Holy Ghost; it doth not yet appear to us by the Word of God to the full, the greatness of what is prepared for God's people.","'Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be' (1 John 3:2).","It doth not appear in the Word; there is a greatness in the things that we are to hope for, that could never be expressed: they are beyond word, beyond thought, beyond conceiving of!","Paul, when he was come down again from out of paradise, into which he was caught up, could not speak a word about the words he heard, and the things that there he saw.","They were things and words which he saw and heard, 'which it is not possible[5] for a man to utter.'",(2.),"Their greatness is intimated by the word Eternal; he that knows the bottom of that word, shall know what things they are.",'The things which are not seen are eternal' (2 Cor 4:18).,"They are 'incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,' reserved in heaven for us (1 Peter 1:4).",(3.),"Their greatness is showed in that one right thought of them will fill the heart so full, that both it and the eyes will run over together; yea, so full, that the creature shall not be able to stand up under the weight of glory that by it is laid upon the soul.",Alas!,"all the things in this world will not fill one heart; and yet one thought that is right, of the things that God has prepared, and laid up in heaven for us, will, yea, and over fill it too.",(4.),"The greatness of the things of the next world appears, in that when one of the least of them are showed to us, we are not able, without support from thence, to abide the sight thereof.","I count that the angels are of those things that are least in that world; and yet the sight of one of them, when the sight of them was in use, what work would it make in the hearts and minds of mortal men, the scripture plainly enough declares (John 13:22).",[6] (5.),"Their greatness is intimated, in that we must be as it were new made again, before we can be capable of enjoying them, as we must enjoy them with comfort (Luke 20:36).","And herein will be a great part of our happiness, that we shall not only see them, but be made like unto them, like unto their King.","For 'when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is' (1 John 3:2).","We shall see him, and therefore must be like him, for else the sight of him would overcome us and destroy us; but because we are to see him with comfort and everlasting joy, therefore we must be like him in body and mind (Rev 1:17; Phil 3:20,21).",II.,"But to come to the second thing, namely, That those that have believed, there are such things as these, will meet with difficulties before they come at them.","This is so grand a truth, that nothing can be said against it.",Many are the afflictions of the righteous; and we must through many tribulations enter into the kingdom of heaven (Acts 14:22).,"The cause from whence these afflictions arise is known to be, 1.","From ourselves; for sin having got such hold in our flesh, makes that opposition against our soul and the welfare of that, that puts us continually to trouble.","Fleshly lusts work against the soul, and so do worldly lusts too (1 Peter 2:11); yea, they quench our graces, and make them that would live, 'ready to die' (Rev 3:2).","Yea, by reason of these, such darkness, such guilt, such fear, such mistrust, ariseth in us, that it is common for us, if we live any while, to make a thousand conclusions, twice told, that we shall never arrive with comfort at the gates of the kingdom of heaven.","The natural tendency of every struggle of the least lust against grace is, if we judge according to carnal reason, to make us question the truth of a work of grace in us, and our right to the world to come.","This it was that made Paul cry out, 'O wretched man that I am!",who shall deliver me!',(Rom 7:24).,"Only he had more wisdom than to follow the natural conclusions that carnal reason was apt to make thereupon, and so hoisted up his soul to hope.",2.,"Sin, by its working in us, doth not only bring darkness, guilt, fear, mistrust, and the like; but it doth oft-times as it were hamstring us, and disable us from going to God by faith and prayer for pardon.","It makes the heart hard, senseless, careless, lifeless, spiritless as to feeling, in all Christian duty; and this is a grievous thing to a gracious soul.","The other things will create a doubt, and drive it up to the head into the soul; but these will go on the other side and clench it.",[7] Now all these things make hoping difficult.,3.,"For by these things the judgment is not only clouded, and the understanding greatly darkened, but all the powers of the soul made to fight against itself, conceiving, imagining, apprehending, and concluding things that have a direct tendency to extirpate and extinguish, if possible, the graces of God that are planted in the soul; yea, to the making of it cry out, 'I am cut off from before thine eyes!'",(Psa 31:22).,4.,"Add to these, the hidings of the face of God from the soul; a thing to it more bitter than death; yet nothing more common among them that hope in the Lord.",He 'hideth his face from the house of Jacob!',(Isa 8:17).,"Nor is this done only in fatherly displeasure, but by this means some graces are kept alive; faith is kept alive by the word, patience by hope, and hope by faith; but oft-times a spirit of prayer, by the rod, chastisement, and the hiding of God's face (Hosea 5:14,15; Isa 26:16; Cant 5:6).","But I say, this hiding of this sweet face is bitter to the soul, and oft-times puts both faith and hope to a sad and most fearful plunge.","For at such a day, it is with the soul as with the ship at sea, that is benighted and without light; to wit, like a man bewildered upon the land; only the text saith, for the help and succour of such, 'Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light?","Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God' (Isa 50:10).","Yet as it is with children, so it is with saints; we are a great deal more subject to fears in the night than in the day.","That, therefore, that tendeth to the help of some graces, if there be not great care taken, will prove an hindrance to others.",5.,"Nor is the ruler of the darkness of this world wanting to apply himself and his engines, so as, if possible, to make use of all these things for the overthrowing of faith, and for the removing of our hope from the Lord, as a tree is removed from rooting in the ground (Job 19:10).",Behold!,"he can expound all things, so as that they shall fall directly in the way of our believing.","As thus, we have sin, therefore we have no grace; sin struggleth in us, therefore we fear not God; something in us sideth with sin, therefore we are wholly unregenerate; sin is in our best performances, therefore wherefore should I hope?","Thus I say, he can afflict us in our pilgrimage, and make hope difficult to us.","Besides the hiding of God's face, he can make not only a cause of sorrow, for that indeed it should, but a ground of despair, and as desperately concluding he will never come again.","How many good souls has he driven to these conclusions, who afterwards have been made to unsay all again?",6.,"And though spiritual desertions, darkness of soul, and guilt of sin, are the burdens most intolerable, yet they are not all; for there is to be added to all these, that common evil of persecution, another device invented to make void our hope.","In this, I say, we are sure to be concerned; that is, if we be godly.","For though the apostle doth not say, 'All that will live in Christ,' that is, in the common profession of him, shall suffer persecution; yet he saith, 'All that will live godly in him shall' (2 Tim 3:12).","Now this in itself is a terror to flesh and blood, and hath a direct tendency in it to make hope difficult (1 Peter 3:6,14).","Hence men of a persecuting spirit, because of their greatness, and of their teeth (the laws), are said to be a terror, and to carry amazement in their doings; and God's people are apt to be afraid of them though they should die, and to forget God their Maker; and this makes hoping hard work (Isa 51:12,13).",[8] 7.,"For besides that grimness that appears in the face of persecutors, Satan can tell how to lessen, and make to dwindle in our apprehensions, those truths unto which our hearts have joined themselves afore, and to which Christ our Lord has commanded us to stand.","So that they shall now appear but little, small, inconsiderable things; things not worth engaging for; things not worth running those hazards for, that in the hour of trial may lie staring us in the face.","Moreover, we shall not want false friends in every hole, such as will continually be boring our ears with that saying, Master, do good to thyself.","At such times also, 'stars' do use to 'fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken'; and so every thing tends to weaken, or at least to lay stumbling-blocks in their way, who are commanded to hope in the Lord (Matt 24).",8.,"Again, as Satan can make use of his subtilty, thus to afflict and weaken the hands and hearts of those that hope in God, so he can add to these the dismalness of a suffering state.","He can make the loss of goods, in our imagination, ten times bigger than it is in itself; he can make an informer a frightful creature, and a jail look like hell itself; he can make banishment and death utterly intolerable, and things that must be shunned with the hazard of our salvation.","Thus he can greaten and lessen, lessen and greaten, for the troubling of our hearts, for the hindering of our hope.",[9] 9.,"Add to all these, that the things that we suffer for were never seen by us, but are quite beyond our sight: things that indeed are said to be great and good; but we have only the word and the Bible for it.","And be sure if he that laboureth night and day to devour us, can help it, our faith shall be molested and perplexed at such a time, that it may, if possible, be hard to do the commandment that here the text enjoins us to the practice of; that is, to hope in the Lord.",And this brings me to the third particular.,III.,"That the grace of hope well exercised, is the only way to overcome those difficulties.--Abraham had never laughed for joy, had he not hoped when the angel brought him tidings of a son; yea, had he not hoped against all things that could have been said to discourage (Gen 17:17).","Hence it is said, that 'against hope' he 'believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be' (Rom 4:18).","There is hope against hope; hope grounded on faith, against hope grounded on reason.","Hope grounded on reason, would have made Abraham expect that the promise should surely have been ineffectual, because of the deadness of Abraham's body, and of the barrenness of Sarah's womb.","But he hoped against the difficulty, by hope that sprang from faith, which confided in the promise and power of God, and so overcame the difficulty, and indeed obtained the promise.","Hope, therefore, well exercised, is the only way to overcome.","Hence Peter bids those that are in a suffering condition, 'Be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ' (1 Peter 1:13).","And therefore it is, as you heard before, that we are said to be 'saved by hope' (Rom 8:24).","Hope is excellent, 1.",Against those discouragements that arise up out of our bowels.,2.,It is excellent to embolden a man in the cause of God.,3.,"It is excellent at helping one over the difficulties that men, by frights and terrors may lay in our way.",1.,It is excellent to help us against those discouragements that arise out of our own bowels (Rom 4).,"This is clear in the instance last mentioned about Abraham, who had nothing but discouragements arising from himself; but he had hope, and as well he exercised it; wherefore, after a little patient enduring, he overcame the difficulty, and obtained the promise (Heb 6:13-18).","The reason is, for that it is the nature of true hope to turn away its ear from opposing difficulties, to the word and mouth of faith; and perceiving that faith has got hold of the promise, hope, notwithstanding difficulties that do or may attempt to intercept, will expect, and so wait for the accomplishment thereof.",2.,Hope is excellent at emboldening a man in the cause of God.,"Hence the apostle saith, 'Hope maketh not ashamed'; for not to be ashamed there, is to be emboldened (Rom 5:5).","So again, when Paul speaks of the troubles he met with for the profession of the gospel, he saith, that they should turn to his salvation.","'According,' saith he, 'to my earnest expectation, and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death' (Phil 1:19,20).","See here, a man at the foot of the ladder, now ready in will and mind, to die for his profession; but how will he carry it now?","Why, with all brave and innocent boldness!",But how will he do that?,O!,"By the hope of the gospel that is in him; for by that he is fully persuaded that the cause he suffereth for will bear him up in the day of God, and that he shall then be well rewarded for it.",[10] 3.,"It is also excellent at helping one over those difficulties that men, by frights and terrors, may lay in our way.","Hence when David was almost killed with the reproach and oppression of his enemies, and his soul full sorely bowed down to the ground therewith; that he might revive and get up again, he calls to his soul to put in exercise the grace of hope, saying, 'Why art thou cast down, O my soul?",and why art thou disquieted within me?,"Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God' (Psa 42:11).","So again saith he in the next Psalm after, as afore he had complained of the oppression of the enemy, 'Why art thou cast down, O my soul?",and why art thou disquieted within me?,"Hope in God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance and my God' (Psa 43:5).","Hope, therefore, is a soul-encouraging grace, a soul-emboldening grace, and a soul-preserving grace.","Hence it is called our helmet or head-piece, the helmet of salvation (Eph 6:17; 1 Thess 5:8).","This is one piece of the armour with which the Son of God was clothed, when he came into the world; and it is that against which nothing can prevail (Isa 49:17).","For as long as I can hope for salvation, what can hurt me!","This word spoken in the blessed exercise of grace, I HOPE FOR SALVATION, drives down all before it.",The truth of God is that man's 'shield and buckler' that hath made the Lord his hope (Psa 91:4).,[Encouragements to exercise this grace.],"--And now to encourage thee, good man, to the exercise of this blessed grace of hope as the text bids, let me present thee with that which followeth.",1.,"God, to show how well he takes hoping in him at our hands, has called himself 'the God of hope' (Rom 15:13), that is, not only the author of hope, but the God that takes pleasure in them that exercise it, 'The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy' (Psa 147:11).",2.,"He will be a shield, a defence to them that hope in him.","'Thou art my hiding-place and my shield,' saith David, 'I hope in thy word'; that is, he knew he would be so; for he hoped in his word (Psa 119:114).",3.,"He has promised us the life we hope for, to encourage us still to hope, and to endure all things to enjoy it (Titus 1:2).","'That he that ploweth should plow in hope, and that he that thresheth in hope, should be partaker of his hope' (1 Cor 9:10).",Quest.,"But you may say, What is it to exercise this grace aright?",Answ.,1.,"You must look well to your faith, that that may prosper, for as your faith is, such your hope will be.",Hope is never ill when faith is well; nor strong if faith be weak.,"Wherefore Paul prays that the Romans might be filled 'with all joy and peace in believing,' that they might 'abound in hope' (Rom 15:13).","When a man by faith believes to joy and peace, then hope grows strong, and with an assurance looketh for a share in the world to come.","Wherefore look to your faith, and pray heartily that the God of hope will fill you with all joy and peace in believing.",2.,"Learn of Abraham not to faint, stumble, or doubt, at the sight of your own weakness; for if you do, hope will stay below, and creak in the wheels as it goes, because it will want the oil of faith.","But say to thy soul, when thou beginnest to faint and sink at the sight of these, as David did to his, in the places made mention of before.",3.,Be much in calling to mind what God has done for thee in former times.,Keep thy experience as a choice thing (Rom 5:4).,'Remember all the way the Lord led thee these forty years in the wilderness' (Deut 8:2).,"'O my God,' saith David, 'my soul is cast down within me, therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites from the hill Mizar' (Psa 42:6).",4.,"Be much in looking at the end of things, or rather to the end of this, and to the beginning of the next world.","What we enjoy of God in this world, may be an earnest of hope, or a token that the thing hoped for is to be ours at last; but the object of hope is in general the next world (Heb 11:1).","We must therefore put a difference betwixt the mother of hope, Faith; the means of hope, the Word; the earnest of hope, Christ in us; and the proper object of hope, to wit, the world to come, and the goodness thereof (Psa 119:49; Col 1:27).","If Christians have not much here, their hope, as I may so say, lies idle, and as a grace out of its exercise.","For as faith cannot feed upon patience, but upon Christ, and as the grace of hungering and thirsting cannot live upon self-fulness, but upon the riches of the promise; so hope cannot make what is enjoyed its object: 'for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for?'",(Rom 8:24).,"But the proper object of hope is, that we see not.","Let faith then be exercised upon Christ crucified for my justification, and hope upon the next world for my glorification; and let love show the truth of faith in Christ, by acts of kindness to Christ and his people; and patience, the truth of hope, by a quiet bearing and enduring that which may now be laid upon me for my sincere profession's sake, until the hope that is laid up for us in heaven shall come to us, or we be gathered to that, and then hope is in some measure in good order, and exercised well.","But, IV.","We now come to the last thing propounded to be spoken to, which is, they that have hope and exercise it well, shall assuredly at last enjoy that hope that is laid up for them in heaven; that is, they that do regularly exercise the grace of hope shall at last enjoy the object of it, or the thing hoped for.","This must of necessity be concluded, else we overthrow the whole truth of God at once, and the expectation of the best of men; yea, if this be not concluded, what follows, but that Atheism, unbelief, and irreligion, are the most right, and profane and debauched persons are in the rights way?",1.,"But to proceed, this must be, as is evident; for that the things hoped for are put under the very name of the grace that lives in the expectation of them.",They are called HOPE; 'looking for that blessed hope'; 'for the hope that is laid up for them in heaven' (Titus 2:13; Col 1:5).,"God has set that character upon them, to signify that they belong to hope, and shall be the reward of hope.","God doth in this, as your great traders do with the goods that their chapmen have either bought or spoke for; to wit, he sets their name or mark upon them, and then saith, This belongs to this grace, and this belongs to that; but the kingdom of heaven belongs to HOPE, for his name is set upon it.","This therefore is one thing, to prove that the thing hoped for shall be thine; God has marked it for thee: nor can it be given to those that do not hope.","That is, to the same purpose that you read of, 'That ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer' (2 Thess 1:5).","Suffering flows from hope; he that hopes not for an house in heaven, will not for it choose to suffer the loss of the pleasures and friendships of this world.","But they that suffer for it, and that all do, one way or other, in whom is placed this grace of hope, they God counteth worthy of it, and therefore, hath marked it with their mark, HOPE; for that it belongs to hope, and shall be given to those that hope.",That is the first.,2.,"They that do, as afore is said, exercise this grace of hope, shall assuredly enjoy the hope that is laid up for them in heaven, as is evident also from this; because, as God has marked and set it apart for them, so what he has done to and with our Lord and Head, since his death, he hath done it to this very end; that is, to beget and maintain our hope in him as touching this thing.","He 'hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ form the dead' (1 Peter 1:3).","The meaning is, Christ is our undertaker, and suffered death for us, that we might enjoy happiness and glory: and God, to show how wiling he was that we should have this glory, raised up Christ again, and delivered him from their sorrows of death.","Wherefore, considering this, Paul said, 'He rejoiced in hope of the glory of God'; to wit, of that glory, that sin, had he not had Jesus for his undertaker, would have caused that he should certainly have come short of (Rom 3:23, 5:2).","But, again, God 'raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory,' too, and that to this very end, 'that your faith and hope might be in God' (1 Peter 1:21).","I say, he did it to this very end, that he might beget in you this good opinion of him, as to hope in him, that he would give you that good thing hoped for--to wit, eternal life.","He 'gave him glory,' and put it into his hand for you who is your head and Saviour, that you might see how willing God is to give you the hope you look for, 'that your faith and hope might be in God.'",3.,"That we that have hope and rightly exercise it, might assuredly enjoy that hope that is laid up for us in heaven: God has promised it, and that to our Saviour for us.","Had he promised it to us, we might yet have feared, for that with our faults we give a cause of continual provocation to him.","But since he hath promised it to Christ, it must assuredly come to us by him, because Christ, to whom it is promised, never gave occasion of provocation to him to take it back.","And that it was promised to Christ, it is evident, because it was promised before the world began: 'In hope of eternal life,' saith Paul, 'which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began' (Titus 1:2).","And this is, that we might hope.","Men that use to hope to enjoy that money or estate, that by those that are faithful is promised to them, and put into the hands of trusty persons for them; why this is the case, God that cannot lie, has promised it to the hopers, and has put it into the hand of the trusty Jesus for us, therefore let us hope that in his times we shall both see and enjoy the same we hope for.",4.,"Yea, that all ground of doubt and scruple as to this might be removed out of the way, when Christ, who as to what was last said, is our hope (1 Tim 1:1), shall come, he shall bring that grace and mercy with him that shall even from before his judgment-seat remove all those things that might have any tendency in them to deprive us of our hope, or of the thing hoped for by us.","Hence Peter bids us, 'Be sober and hope to the end, for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ' (1 Peter 1:13).","Also as to this, Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, joins with him, saying, 'Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life' (Jude 21).","Here then you see that there is grace and mercy still for us in reversion; grace and mercy to be brought unto us at the revelation, or second coming of Jesus Christ.",How then can we be hindered of our hope?,For transporting mercy will then be busy for them that indeed have here the hope of eternal life.,"'And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him' (Mal 3:17).",None knows the mystery of God's will in all things revealed in his Word.,"Therefore many texts are looked over, or laid by, as those whose key doth go too hard; nor will I boast of any singular knowledge in any particular thing.","[11] Yet methinks since grace and mercy was not only brought by Christ when he came into the world, but shall be brought again with him when he comes in his Father's glory, it signifies, that as the first brought the beginning of eternal life to us while we were enemies, this second will bring the full enjoyment of it to us while we are saints, attended with many imperfections.","And that as by the first grace of all unworthiness was pardoned and passed by; so by this second grace, the grace that is to be brought unto us at the revelation of Jesus Christ, all shortness in duties, and failings in performances, shall be spared also; and we made possessors by virtue of this grace and mercy of the blessings hoped for, to wit, the blessings of eternal life.","But thus much for the duty contained in the exhortation, to wit, of hoping.",[Second.,A direction to the well managing of the duty of hope.],"I shall therefore come, in the next place, to treat of the well managing of this duty with reference to this primary object, which is the Lord himself.",'Let Israel hope in the Lord.',"There is a general object of hope, and there is a particular object; there is a common object, and there is a special one.","Of the general and common object, to wit, of heaven and happiness, I have said something already; wherefore it remains that now we come and treat of this particular and special object of our hope: 'Let Israel hope in the Lord.'","The Lord, therefore, is to be the particular and special object of our hope: 'Let Israel hope in the Lord.'","Now in that there is not only a duty here exhorted to, but a direction for the better management of that duty, to the particular and special object upon which this duty should be exercised, it suggesteth, how apt good men are, especially in times of trouble, the case of Israel now, to fix their hopes in other things than on the Lord.","We have seen a great deal of this in our days; our days indeed have been days of trouble, especially since the discovery of the Popish plot, for then we began to fear cutting of throats, of being burned in our beds, and of seeing our children dashed in pieces before our faces.","But looking about us, we found we had a gracious king, brave parliaments, a stout city, good lord-mayors, honest sheriffs, substantial laws against them, and these we made the object of our hope, quite forgetting the direction in this exhortation, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord.'","For indeed the Lord ought to be our hope in temporals, as well as in spirituals and eternals.","Wherefore Israel of old were checked, under a supposition of placing their hope for temporals in men; 'It is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in man.","It is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in princes' (Psa 118:8,9).","And again, 'Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help' (Psa 146:3).","This implieth that there is in us an incidency to forget God our hope, and to put confidence in something else.","And to be sure we shall find it the more difficult to make the Lord our hope only, when things that are here, though deceitfully, proffer us their help.",[12] But my design is not to treat of the object of hope but with reference to the next world.,"And as to that we must take heed that we set our hope in God, in God in the first place, and in nothing below or besides himself.","To this end it is that he has given us his word, and appointed a law to Israel.",I.,"Because of his own grace he is become the special object of hope, designating himself in the most special sense to be the portion of his people (Psa 78:5-7)--'The Lord is my portion, saith my soul, therefore will I hope in him' (Lam 2:24).","Wherefore this we must look well to, and take heed that we miss not of this object (Psa 146:5).","This is the special object, the ultimate object, the object that we cannot be without; and that, short of which, we cannot be happy as, God willing, shall be showed more anon (Jer 50:7).","God is not only happiness in himself, but the life of the soul, and he that puts goodness into every thing in the next world, in which goodness shall be found (Jer 17:13).","And this our Lord Jesus Christ himself affirmeth, when he saith, 'I am the way,' to wit, the way to life and happiness.","And yet he saith, 'I am the way to the Father,' for that it is HE that is the fountain and ocean of happiness and bliss.","So then, that we might in the next world be heirs of the highest good, God has made us heirs of his own good self; 'Heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ'; heirs of God through Christ (Rom 18:17; Gal 4:7).","This God, this eternal God, therefore, is of necessity to be the object of our hope, because he is, of grace, become our hope.","The church in heaven, called the body and temple of God, is to be an habitation for himself, when it is finished, to dwell in for ever and ever.","This then we hope for, to wit, to be possessed at that day with eternal life; eternal glory (1 Tim 6:12,19).",Now this eternal life and eternal glory is through God the hope of his people (1 Peter 5:10; 1 John 5:20).,"And for this end, and to this bliss, are we called and regenerate in this world, 'That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs, according to the hope of eternal life' (Titus 3:7).","Nor can it be, that heaven and happiness should ever be the portion of them that make not God their hope, any more than such a lady should hope to enjoy the estate of such a lord, who first makes not the lord himself her husband.","[13] Heaven, heaven is the talk of the ignorant, while the God of heaven they cannot abide.",But shall such ever come to glory?,"But, II.","God must be the special object of our hope, and him in special that must be enjoyed by us in the next world, or nothing can make us happy.","We will suppose now, for the illustrating of this matter, that which is not to be supposed.","As, 1.","Suppose a man, when he dieth, should go to heaven, that golden place, what good would this do him, if he was not possessed of the God of it?","It would be, as to sweetness, but a thing unsavoury; as to durableness, but a thing uncertain; as to society, as a thing forlorn; and as to life, but a place of death.","All this is made to appear by the angels that fell; for when fallen, what was heaven to them?","Suppose they staid but one quarter of an hour there after their fall, before they were cast out, what sweetness found they there, but guilt?","What stay, but a continual fall of heart and mind?","What society, but to be abandoned of all?","And what life, but death in its perfection?","Yea, if it be true that some think, that for the promoting of grace, they are admitted yet to enter that place to accuse the saints on earth, yet what do they find there but what is grievous to them?",It is the presence of God that makes heaven Heaven in all its beauteousness.,"Hence David, when he speaks of heaven, says, 'Whom have I in heaven but thee?'",(Psa 73:25).,"As who should say, What would heaven yield to me for delights, if I was there without my God?",It is the presence of God that will make heaven sweet to those who are his.,"And as it is that that makes the place, so it is interest in him that makes the company, and the deeds that are done there, pleasant to the soul.","What solace can he that is without God, though he were in heaven, have with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the prophets and angels?","How could he join in their thanks, and praises, and blessings of him for ever and ever, in whose favour, mercy, and grace, they are not concerned?",2.,"Suppose a man, when he dieth, should be made to live for ever, but without the enjoyment of God, what good would his life do him?","Why, it would be filled full of horror, darkness, desolation, sorrow, and all things that would tend to make it bitter to the soul.",Witness they that live in hell; if it be proper to say they live in hell?,"It is no more possible for a man to live happily, were he possessed of all that heaven and life could afford him, suppose him to be without interest in God, than it is for a man that hath all the enjoyments of this world, if the sun was taken from him out of the firmament.","As all things, whether it be heaven, angels, heavenly pleasures and delights, have had their being of him, so their being is continued by him, and made sweet of him.","Now, for the well managing of our hope, with reference to this special object of it, there are these things to be considered.",And now I speak to all.,"We must know him right, we must come to him right.",(1.),We must know him right.,"It is essential to happiness, and so to the making of the God of heaven our hope, to know him rightly (John 17:1-3).","It is not every fancy, or every imagination of God, that thou mayst have, that will prove that therefore thou knowest God aright.","In him there 'is no variableness, neither shadow of turning' (James 1:17).","He only is what he is, what imaginations soever we have of him.","We may set up idols and images of him, as much in our minds as some do in their houses and in their temples, and be as great, though not so gross idolaters as they.","[14] Now if thou wouldst know him, thou must diligently feel for him in his works, in his Word, and in his ways, if perhaps thou mayst find the knowledge of him (Prov 2:1-5; Acts 17:27).",(2.),"Beware, when thou hast found him, that thou go to him by his Son, whom he has sanctified and sent into the world, to be the way for sinners to go to God; and see that thou keepest in this path always, for out of him he is found intolerable, and a consuming-fire.",(3.),"Busy thyself with all thy might to make an interest in his Son, and he will willingly be thy Saviour, for he must become thine before his Father can be the object of thy hope (John 3:36).","He that hath the Son, hath the Father, but contrariwise, he that hath not him has neither (2 John 9).",(4.),"Stay not in some transient comforts, but abide restless till thou seest an union betwixt thee and this Blessed One; to wit, that he is a root, and thou a branch; that he is head, and thou a member.","And then shalt thou know that the case is so between thee and him, when grace and his Spirit has made thee to lay the whole stress of thy justification upon him and has subdued thy heart and mind to be 'one spirit' with him (Rom 4:4,5; 1 Cor 6:17).",(5.),"This done, hope thou in God, for he is become thy hope, that is, the object of it.","And for thy encouragement so to do, consider that he is able to bear up thy heart, and has said he will do it, as to this very thing, to all those that thus hope in him.","'Be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart,' all ye that hope in the Lord (Psa 31:24).","It is manifest, as was said before, that many difficulties lie in the way of hoping; but God will make those difficulties easy, by strengthening the heart of him that hopeth, to hope.","He has a way to do that, which no creature can hinder, by the blessed work of his Holy Spirit.","He can show us he loves us, that he may encourage our hope.","And as he can work in us for our encouragement, so he can and will, as was said before, himself, in his time, answer our hope, by becoming our hope himself.","'The Lord shall be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel' (Joel 3:16).","His faithfulness also is a great encouragement to his, to hope for the accomplishment of all that he hath promised unto his people.","'Hath he said it, and shall he not make it good?'","When he promised to bring Israel into the land of Canaan, he accomplished it to a tittle.","'There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass' (Josh 21:45, 23:14).","Also what he with his mouth had promised to David, with his hand he fulfilled to Solomon in the view of all the thousands of Israel (1 Kings 8:22-24; 2 Chron 6:7-10).",[Third.,The persons who are concerned in the management of this duty of hope.],"I will omit making mention again of the encouragements spoken of before, and shall now come to the third thing specified in this part of the text, to wit, to show more distinctly, who, and what particular persons they are, who are concerned in this exhortation to hope.","They are put, as you see, under this general term Israel; 'Let Israel hope in the Lord.'","And, 'He shall save Israel from all his troubles.'","Israel is to be taken three ways, in the Scripture.",1.,For such that are Israel after the flesh.,2.,For such as are such neither after the flesh nor the Spirit; but in their own fancies and carnal imaginations only.,3.,"For such as are Israel after God, or the Spirit.",1.,"Israel is to be taken for those that are such after the flesh; that is, for those that sprang from the loins of Jacob, and are called, 'Israel after the flesh, the children of the flesh.'","Now these, as such, are not the persons interested in this exhortation, for by the flesh comes no true spiritual and eternal grace (Rom 9:6-8; 2 Cor 1:10-18).","Men are not within the bounds of the promise of eternal life, as they are the children of the flesh, either in the more gross or more refined sense (Phil 3:4-6).","Jacob was as spiritual a father as any HE, I suppose that now professeth the gospel; but his spiritualness could not convey down to this children, that were such only after the flesh, that spirit and grace that causeth sound conversion, and salvation by Jesus Christ.","Hence Paul counts it a carnal thing to glory in this; and tells us plainly, If he had heretofore known Christ thus, that is, to have been his brother or kinsman, according to the flesh, or after that, he would henceforth know him, that is, so, 'no more' (2 Cor 5:16-18).","For though the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet not that multitude, but the remnant that the Lord hath chosen and shall call, shall be saved (Rom 9:27; Joel 2:32).","This, therefore, is as an arrow against the face of that false doctrine that the Jews leaned upon, to wit, that they were in the state of grace, and everlasting favour of God, because the children and offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.","But, 2.","Israel may be taken for such as are neither so after the flesh, nor the Spirit, but in their own fancy and imagination only.","And such I take to be all those that you read of in Revelation 2:9 which said 'they were Jews, and were not,' 'but did lie' (3:9).","These I take to be those carnal gospellers,[15] that from among the Gentiles pretended themselves to be Jews inwardly, whose circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit, when they were such only in their own fancies and conceits, and made their profession out as a lie (Rom 2:28,29).","Abundance of these there are at this day in the world; men who know neither the Father, nor the Son, nor anything of the way of the Spirit, in the work of regeneration; and yet presume to say, 'They are Jews'; that is, truly and spiritually the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.","'For' now, 'he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit,--whose praise is not of men, but of God.'","And although it may please some now to say, as they of old said to them of the captivity, 'We seek your God as ye do' (Ezra 4:2); yet at last it will be found, that as they, such have 'no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem' (Neh 2:20).","And I would from hence caution all to take heed of presuming to count themselves Jews, unless they have a substantial ground so to do.","For to do this without a good bottom, makes all our profession a lie; and not only so, but it hindereth us of a sight of a want of an interest in Jesus Christ, without which we cannot be saved; yea, such an one is the great self-deceiver, and so the worst deceiver of all: for he that deceives his own self, his own heart, is a deceiver in the worst sense; nor can any disappointment be like unto that which casts away soul and body at once (James 1:22,26).",O slender thread!,"that a man should think, that because he fancieth himself 'an Israelite indeed,' that therefore he shall go for such an one in the day of judgment; or that he shall be able to cheat God with a pitiful say-so!",3.,"But the Israel under consideration in the text, is Israel after God, or the Spirit; hence they are called 'the Israel of God,' because they are made so of him, not by generation, nor by fancy, but by Divine power (Can 6:16).","And thus was the first of this name made so, 'Thy name shall be called no more Jacob but Israel' (Gen 32:28).","This then is the man concerned in the text, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord'; to wit, Israel that is so of God's making, and of God's allowance: for men are not debarred from calling themselves after this most godly name, provided they are so indeed; all that is dangerous is, when men shall think this privilege comes by carnal generation, or that their fancying of themselves to be such will bear them out in the day of judgment.","Otherwise, if men become the true servants of God by Christ, they have, as I said, an allowance so to subscribe themselves.","'One shall say, I am the Lord's and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel' (Isa 44:5).","But then, for the further describing of such, they must be men of circumcised and tender hearts; they must be such 'which worship God in the spirit, and that rejoice in Christ Jesus, and that have no confidence in the flesh' (Phil 3:3), for these are the Nathaniels, the Israelites indeed in whom there is no guile (John 1:47), and these are they that are intended in the exhortation, when he saith, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord.'","For these are formed for that very end, that they might hope in the Lord; yea, the word and testament are given to them for this purpose (Psa 78:5-7).","These are prisoners of hope all the time they are in the state of nature, even as the whole creation is subjected under hope, all the time of its bondage, by the sin and villainy of man; and unto them it shall be said, in the dispensation of the fullness of time, 'Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope' (Zech 9:12); as certainly as that which is called the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God (Rom 8:18-21).","Only here, as I said before, let all men have a care in this thing: this is the pinnacle, the point; he that is right here, is right in all that is necessary to salvation; but he that misses here, can by no means be right anywhere to his soul's advantage in the other world.",[Improvement.],"If I should a little improve the text where this title is first given to man, and show the posture he was in when it was said to him, 'Thy name shall be called Israel'; and should also debate upon the cause or ground of that, 'An Israelite indeed,' thou mightest not repent it who shall read it; and therefore a few words to each.",1.,"When Jacob received the name of Israel, he was found wrestling with the angel; yea, and so resolved a wrestler was he, that he purposed, now he had begun, not to give out without a blessing, 'I will not let thee go,' said he, 'except thou bless me' (Gen 32:26).","Discouragements he had while he wrestled with him, to have left off, before he obtained his desire; for the angel bid him leave off; 'let me go,' said he.","He had wrestled all night, and had not prevailed; and now the day brake upon him, and consequently his discouragement was like to be the greater, for that now the majesty and terribleness of him with whom he wrestled would be seen more apparently; but this did not discourage him: besides, he lost the use of a limb as he wrestled with him; yet all would not put this Israel out.","Pray he did, and pray he would, and nothing should make him leave off prayer, until he had obtained, and therefore he was called 'Israel.'","'For as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed' (Gen 32:28,30).","A wrestling spirit of prayer is a demonstration of an Israel of God; this Jacob had, this he made use of, and by this he obtained the name of 'Israel.'","A wrestling spirit of prayer in straits, difficulties, and distresses; a wrestling spirit of prayer when alone in private, in the night, when none eye seeth but God's then to be at it, then to lay hold of God, then to wrestle, to hold fast, and not to give over until the blessing is obtained, is a sign of one that is an Israel of God.",2.,"'Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile' (John 1:47).",This was the testimony of the Lord Jesus concerning Nathaniel (v 46).,"Nathaniel was persuaded by Philip to come to Jesus, and as he was coming, Jesus saith to the rest of the disciples concerning him, 'Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.'","Then said Nathaniel to Jesus, 'Whence knowest thou me?","Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree I saw thee' (v 15).","Nathaniel, as Jacob, was at prayer, at prayer alone under the fig-tree, wrestling in prayer, for what no man can certainly tell, but probably for the Messias, or for the revelation of him: for the seeing Jews were convinced that the time of the promise was out; and all men were in expectation concerning John, whether he might not be he (Luke 3:15).","But Nathaniel was under the fig-tree, alone with God, to inquire of him, and that with great earnestness and sincerity; else the Lord Jesus would not thus have excused him of hypocrisy, and justified his action as he did, concluding from what he did there that he was a true son of Jacob; and ought, as he, to have his name changed from what his parents gave him, to this given him of Christ, 'An Israelite indeed.'","Wherefore, from both these places, it is apparent, that a wrestling spirit of prayer, in private, is one of the best signs that this or that man or woman is of Israel; and, consequently, such who are within the compass of the exhortation here, saying, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord.'","I say, it is this wrestling spirit of prayer with God alone; for as for that of public prayer, though I will not condemn it, it gives not ground for this character, notwithstanding all the flourishes and excellencies that may therein appear.","I am not insensible what pride, what hypocrisy, what pretences, what self-seekings of commendations and applause, may be countenanced by those concerned in, or that make public prayers; and how little thought or savour of God may be in all so said; but this closet, night, or alone prayer, is of another stamp, and attended, at least so I judge, with that sense, those desires, that simplicity, and those strugglings, wherewith that in public is not.","[16] Nay, I think verily a man cannot addict himself to these most solemn retirements, without some of Jacob's and Nathaniel's sense and sincerity, wrestlings and restlessness for mercy; wherefore, laying aside all other, I shall abide by this, That the man that is as I have here described, is not an Israelite of the flesh, nor one so only in his fancy or imagination, but one made so of God; one that is called a child of promise, and one to whom this exhortation doth belong: 'Let Israel hope in the Lord'; to wit, they that serve God by prayer day and night (Luke 2:37; Acts 26:5-7).","These, I say, are Israel, the Israel of God, and let these hope in the Lord, from now, 'henceforth, and for ever' (Psa 131:3).",[SECOND.,The manner by which the exhortation is expressed.],"Having thus briefly touched upon those three things that are contained in the matter of the exhortation, I now come to speak a word to the manner of praises by which the exhortation is presented to us, 'Let Israel hope'; he doth not say, Israel hath hoped; Israel did hope; or Israel can hope, but 'let Israel hope in the Lord.'","'Let' is a word very copious, and sometimes signifies this, and sometimes that, even according as the nature or reason of the thing under debate, or to be expressed, will with truth and advantage bear.","Let him hope, First.","Sometimes 'let' is equivalent to a command; 'Let every soul be subject to the higher powers,' this is a command.","'Let all things be done decently and in order,' this also is a command.","So here, 'Let Israel hope,' this also is a command; and so enjoins a duty upon Israel; for why, since they seek for mercy, should they not have it; now a command lays a very strong obligation upon a man to do this or another duty.",'He commandeth all men every where to repent'; but Israel only to hope in his mercy.,"Now take the exhortation and convert it into a commandment, and it showeth us, (1.)","in what good earnest God offers his mercy to his Israel; he commands them to hope in him, as he is and will be so to them.",(2.),"It supposes an impediment in Israel, as to the faculty of receiving or hoping in God for mercy; we that would have God be merciful, we that cry and pray to him to show us mercy, have yet that weakness and impediment in our faith, which greatly hindereth us from a steadfast hoping in the Lord for mercy.",(3.),"It suggesteth also, that Israel SINS, if he hopeth not in God, God would not that all should attempt to hope, because they have no faith; for he is for having of them first believe, knowing that it is in vain to think of hoping, until they have believed; but Israel has believed, and therefore God has commanded them to hope, and they sin if they obey him not in this, as in all other duties.","He commands thee, I say, since thou hast believed in his Son, to hope, that is, to expect to see his face in the next world with joy and comfort; this is hoping, this is thy duty, this God commands thee.",Second.,"As this word 'let' is sometimes equivalent to a command, so it is expressed sometimes also to show a grant, leave, or license, to do a thing: such are these that follow, 'Let us come boldly to the throne of grace' (Heb 4:6).",'Let us draw near with a true heart' (ch 10).,"'Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering' (vv 22,23).","Here also this manner of expressing the thing may be taken in the same sense, to wit, to show that Israel has a grant, a leave, a license, to trust in the Lord.",And O!,"what a privilege is this, but who believes it?","And yet as truly as God has granted to Jacob, to Israel, repentance unto life, and by that means has made him fly for refuge, to lay hold of Christ set before him as a justifier; so has he granted him leave and license to trust in him for ever, and to hope for his favour in the next world.","And if you take the word in this sense, to wit, for a grant, leave, or license, to hope in God; then (1.)","This shows how liberal God is of himself, and things, to Israel.","Let Israel hope in me, trust to me, expect good things at my hand; I give him leave and license to do it.","Let him live in a full expectation of being with me, and with my Son in glory; I give him leave to do so; he has license from me to do so.",(2.),"Understand the word thus, and it shows us with what boldness and confidence God would have us hope in him.","They that have leave and license to do a thing, may do it with confidence and boldness, without misgivings and reluctance of mind; this is our privilege; we may live in a full assurance of hope unto the end, we may hope perfectly to the end, we have leave, license, and a grant to do it.",(3.),"Understand the word thus, and it also shows you how muddy, how dark those of Israel are, and how little they are acquainted with the goodness of their God, who stand shrinking at his door like beggars, and dare not in a godly sort be bold, with his mercy.","Wherefore standest thou thus with thy Ifs and thy O-buts, O thou poor benighted Israelite.","Wherefore puttest thou thy hand in thy bosom, as being afraid to touch the hem of the garment of the Lord?","Thou hast a leave, a grant, a license, to hope for good to come, thy Lord himself has given it to thee, saying, 'LET Israel hope in the Lord.'",Third.,"This word 'let' is also sometimes used by way of rebuke and snub; 'Let her alone, for her soul is vexed' (2 Kings 4:27).","'Let her alone, why trouble ye her?'",(Mark 14:6).,"'Refrain from these men, and let them alone' (Acts 5:38).",And it may also so be taken here.,"But if so, then it implies, that God in this exhortation rebuketh those evil instruments, those fallen angels, with all others that attempt to hinder us in the exercise of this duty.","As Boaz said to his servants, when Ruth was to glean in his field, 'let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not' (Ruth 2:15,16).","We have indeed those that continually endeavour to hinder us of living in the full assurance of hope, as to being with God and with Christ in glory: but here is a rebuke for such, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord.'","And it shows us, 1.","That what suggestions come from Satan to make us that are Israelites to doubt, come not for that end, by virtue of any commission that he hath from God.","God has rebuked him in the text, and you may see it also elsewhere.","These temptations, therefore, are rather forged of malice, and of despite to our faith and hope; and so should be accounted by us (Zech 1:1-3).",2.,"This shows us also that we should take heed of crediting of that which comes unto us to hinder our hope in the Lord; lest we take part with Satan, while God rebuketh him, and countenanceth that which fights against the grace of God in us.",3.,"It shows us also that as faith, so hope, cannot be maintained with great difficulty, and that we should endeavour to maintain it, and hope through every difficulty.",Fourth.,This word 'LET' is sometimes used by way of request or intreaty.,"'I pray thee, LET Tamar my sister come' (2 Sam 13:6).","'LET it be granted to the Jews to do,' &c. (Esth 9:13).","And if it be so to be taken here, or if in the best sense this interpretation of it may here be admitted, the consideration thereof is amazing; for then it is all one as if God by the mouth of his servant, the penman of this psalm, did intreat us to hope in him.","And why this may not be implied here, as well as expressed elsewhere, I know not.","'God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God' (2 Cor 5:20).","Why should God beseech us to reconcile to him, but that we might hope in him?","and if it be thus taken here, it shows, 1.","The great condescension of God, in that he doth not only hold out to us the advantages of hoping in God, but desires that we should hope, that we might indeed be partakers of those advantages.",2.,"It teaches us also humility, and that always in the acts of faith and hope we should mix blushing, and shame, with our joy and rejoicing.","Kiss the ground, sinner; put 'thy mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope' (Lam 3:29).",Fifth.,"And lastly, This word is used sometimes by way of caution.","'Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall' (1 Cor 10:12).","'Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it' (Heb 4:1), and if it should be so taken here, then, 1.","This shows us the evil of despair, and that we at times are incident to it; our daily weaknesses, our fresh guilt, our often decays, our aptness to forget the goodness of God, are direct tendencies unto this evil, of which we should be aware; for it robs God of his glory, and us of our comfort, and gratifies none but the devil and unbelief.",2.,"It showeth us that despair is a fall, a falling down from our liberty; our liberty is to hope; it is our portion from God; for he hath said that himself will be the hope of his people.","To do the contrary, is therefore a falling from God, a departing from God through an evil heart of unbelief.","It is the greatest folly in the world for an Israelite to despair; 'Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel.","My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is passed over from my God?",Hast thou not known?,"hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not?",There is no searching of his understanding.,"He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might, he increaseth strength.","Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall.","But they that wait upon,' that is, hope in, 'the Lord, shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint' (Isa 40:27-31).",[THIRD.,Inferences from the exhortation.],"Now we come to those inferences that do naturally flow from this exhortation, and they are in number four.",First.,"That hope and the exercise of it, is as necessary in its place, as faith, and the exercise of it.","All will grant that there is need of a daily exercise of faith; and we are bid to hope unto the end, because hope is the grace that relieveth the soul when dark and weary.",Hope is as the bottle to the faint and sinking spirit.,Hope calls upon the soul not to forget how far it is arrived in its progress towards heaven.,Hope will point and show it the gate afar off; and therefore it is called the hope of salvation.,Hope exerciseth itself upon God.,1.,"By those mistakes that the soul hath formerly been guilty of, with reference to the judgment that it hath made of God, and of his dealings with it.",And this is an excellent virtue.,"'I said,' once says the church, that 'my hope is perished from the Lord,' but I was deceived; 'this I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope'; that is, why, if I give way to such distrusting thoughts, may I not be wrong again?",(Lam 3:18-21).,Therefore will I hope!,This virtue is that which belongs to this grace only; for this and this only is it that can turn unbelief and doubts to advantage.,"'I said in my haste,' said David, 'I am cut off from before thine eyes'; nevertheless I was mistaken; 'thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee' (Psa 31:22).",And what use doth he make of this?,"Why, an exhortation to all good men to hope, and to take advantage to hope from the same mistakes.","I think I am cast off from God, says the soul; so thou thoughtest afore, says memory, but thou wast mistaken then, and why not the like again?",and therefore will I hope.,"When I had concluded that God would never come near me more, yet after that he came to me again, and as I was then, so I am now; therefore will I hope.",2.,"True hope, in the right exercise of it upon God, makes no stick at weakness or darkness; but rather worketh up the soul to some stay, by these.",Thus Abraham's hope wrought by his weakness (Rom 4).,"And so Paul, when I am weak, then I am strong; I will most gladly therefore rejoice in mine infirmities (2 Cor 12).","But this cannot be done where there is no hope, nor but by hope: for it is hope, and the exercise of it, that can say, Now I expect that God should bring good out of all this.","And as for the dark, it is its element to act in that: 'But hope that is seen is not hope' (Rom 8:24).",But we must hope for that we see not.,"So David, 'Why art thou cast down, O my soul?",hope thou in God.',"Christians have no reason to mistrust the goodness of God, because of their weakness, &c. 'I had fainted unless I had believed to see' (Psa 27:13).","By believing there, he means hoping to see, as the exhortation drawn from thence doth import.",3.,"Hope will make use of our calling, to support the soul, and to help it, by that, to exercise itself in a way of expectation of good from God.","Hence the apostle prays for the Ephesians, that they may be made to see what is 'the hope of their calling'; that is, what good that is which by their calling they have ground to hope is laid up in heaven, and to be brought unto them at the appearance of Jesus Christ (Eph 1:17,18).",For thus the soul by this grace of hope will reason about this matter: God has called me; surely it is to a feast.,"God has called me to the fellowship of his Son, surely it is that I may be with him in the next world.","God has given me the spirit of faith and prayer; surely it is that I might hope for what I believe is, and wait for what I pray for.",God his given me some tastes already; surely it is to encourage me to hope that he purposeth to bring me into the rich fruition of the whole.,4.,Hope will exercise itself upon God by those breakings wherewith he breaketh his people for their sins.,'The valley of Achor' must be given 'for a door of hope' (Hosea 2:15).,The valley of Achor; what is that?,"Why, the place where Achan was stoned for his wickedness, and the place where all Israel was afflicted for the same (Josh 7).","I say, hope can gather by this, that God has a love to the soul; for when God hateth a man he chastiseth him not for his trespasses.","[17] 'If ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons' (Heb 12:8).","Hence Moses tells Israel, that when the hand of God was upon them for their sins, they should consider in their heart, 'that as a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee' (Deut 8:5).","And why thus consider, but that a door might be opened for hope to exercise itself upon God by this?","This is that also that is intended in Paul to the Corinthians, 'When we are judged we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world' (1 Cor 11:32).",Is not here a door of hope?,"And why a door of hope, but that by it, God's people, when afflicted, should go out by it from despair by hope?",[Second.],"But it is to be inferred, secondly, That the exercise of hope upon God is very delightful to him: else he would not have commanded and granted us a liberty to hope, and have snibbed those that would hinder.","'Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him; upon them that hope in his mercy; to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine' (Psa 33:18,19).","That God is much delighted in the exercise of this grace, is evident, because of the preparation that he has made for this grace, wherewith to exercise itself.","'For whatsoever things were writ aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope' (Rom 15:4).","Mark, the whole history of the Bible, with the relation of the wonderful works of God with his people from the beginning of the world, are written for this very purpose, that we, by considering and comparing, by patience and comfort of them, might have hope.",The Bible is the scaffold or stage that God has builded for hope to play his part upon in this world.,"It is therefore a thing very delightful to God to see hope rightly given its colour before him; hence he is said, 'to laugh at the trial of the innocent' (Job 9:23).",Why at his trial?,"Because his trial puts him upon the exercise of hope: for then indeed there is work for hope, when trials are sharp upon us.",But why is God so delighted in the exercise of this grace of hope?,1.,Because hope is a head-grace and governing.,"There are several lusts in the soul that cannot be mastered, if hope be not in exercise; especially if the soul be in great and sore trials.","There is peevishness and impatience, there is fear and despair, there is doubting and misconstruing of God's present hand; and all these become masters, if hope be not stirring; nor can any grace besides put a stop to their tumultuous raging in the soul.","But now hope in God makes them all hush, takes away the occasion of their working, and lays the soul at the foot of God.","'Surely,' saith the Psalmist, 'I have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother, my soul is even as a weaned child.'",But how came he to bring his soul into so good a temper?,"Why, that is gathered by the exhortation following, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord from henceforth and for ever' (Psa 131:2,3).","It was by hoping in the Lord that he quieted his soul, and all its unruly sinful passions.",2.,"As hope quasheth and quieteth sinful passions, so it putteth into order some graces that cannot be put into order without it: as patience, meekness, silence, and long-suffering, and the like.","These are all in a day of trial out of place, order, and exercise, where hope forbeareth to work.","I never saw a distrusting man, a patient man, a quiet man, a silent man, and a meek man, under the hand of God, except he was 'dead in sin' at the time.",But we are not now talking of such.,"But now let a man hope in the Lord, and he presently concludes this affliction is for my good, a sign God loves me, and that which will work out for me a far more and exceeding and eternal weight of glory; and so it puts the graces of the soul into order (Luke 21:19).","Wherefore patience, by which a man is bid to possess or keep his soul under the cross, is called 'the patience of hope' (1 Thess 1:3).","So in another place, when he would have the church patient in tribulation, and continue instant in prayer, he bids them 'rejoice in hope,' knowing that the other could not be done without it (Rom 12:12).",3.,"God takes much delight in the exercise of hope, because it construeth all God's dispensations, at present, towards it, for the best: 'When he hath tried me I shall come forth like gold' (Job 23:10).",This is the language of hope.,"God, saith the soul, is doing of me good, making of me better, refining of my inward man.","Take a professor that is without hope, and either he suffereth affliction of pride and ostentation, or else he picks a quarrel with God and throws up all.","For he thinks that God is about to undo him; but hope construeth all to the best, and admits no such unruly passions to carry the man away.",4.,"Therefore hope makes the man, be the trials what they will, to keep still close to the way and path of God.","'My foot,' said hoping Job, 'hath held his steps, his way have I kept and not declined, neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips' (Job 23:11,12).","And again, 'Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way: though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death' (Psa 44:18,19).",But how came they thus patiently to endure?,"Why, they by hope put patience and prayer into exercise.","They knew that their God was as it were but asleep, and that in his time he would arise for their help; and when he did arise he would certainly deliver.",Thus is this psalm applied by Paul (Rom 8).,[Third.],"There is also inferred from this exhortation, that the hope of those that are not Israelites is not esteemed of God.",'Let Israel hope.',"The words are exclusive, shutting out the rest.","He doth not say, Let Amalek hope, let Babylon, or the Babylonians hope; but even in and by this exhortation shutteth out both the rest and their hope from his acceptance.","This being concluded, it follows, that some may hope and not be the better for their hope.",'The hypocrite's hope shall perish' (Job 8:13); their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost (11:20).,'For what is the hope of the hypocrite?',(27:8).,"Again, 'The hope of unjust men perisheth' (Prov 11:7).","There is a hope that perisheth, both it and he that hoped with it together.","The reasons are, 1.","Because it floweth not from faith and experience, but rather from conceit and presumption.","Hope, as I have told you, if it be right, cometh of faith, and is brought forth by experience: but the hope now under consideration is alone, and has no right original, and therefore not regarded.","It is not the hope of God, but the hope of man; that is, it is not the hope of God's working, but the hope that standeth in natural abilities.","'Thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth, and thou destroyest the hope of man' (Job 14:19).","Whatsoever in religious matters is but of a carnal and earthly existence, must be washed away, when the overflowing scourge shall at the end pass over the world (Isa 28:17-19).",2.,Because the Lord's mercy is not the object of it.,"The worldly man makes gold, or an arm of flesh his hope; that is, the object of it, and so he despiseth God (Job 31:24; Jer 3:23).","Or if he be a religious hypocrite, his hope terminates in his own doings: he trusteth, or hopeth, in himself, that he is righteous (Luke 18:9).","All these things are abhorred of God, nor can he, with honour to his name, or in a compliance with his own eternal designs, give any countenance to such a hope as this.",3.,This hope has no good effect on the heart and mind of him that hath it.,"It purifieth not the soul, it only holds fast a lie, and keeps a man in a circuit, at an infinite distance from waiting upon God.",4.,"This hope busieth all the powers of the soul about things that are of the world, or about those false objects on which it is pitched; even as the spider diligently worketh in her web--unto which also this hope is compared--in vain.","This hope will bring that man that has it, and exercises it, to heaven, when leviathan is pulled out of the sea with a hook; or when his jaw is bored through with a thorn: but as he that thinks to do this, hopeth in vain; so, even so, will the hope of the other be as unsuccessful; 'So are the paths of all that forget God, and the hypocrite's hope shall perish; whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.","He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure' (Job 8:13-15, 41:1-9).","This is the hope that is not esteemed of God, nor the persons that have it, preferred by him a whit before their own dung (Job 20:4-8).",[Fourth.],"There is also inferred from these words, That Israel himself is subject to swerve in his soul about the object of hope.","For this text is to him as a command and grant, so an instruction by which he is to be informed, how and upon whom to set his hope.","That Israel is apt to swerve as to the object of his hope, is evident, for that so much ado is made by the prophets to keep him upon his God; in that so many laws and statutes are made to direct him to set his hope in God: and also by his own confession (Psa 78:7; Jer 3:23-25; Lam 4:17).","The fears also and the murmurings and the faintings that attend the godly in this life, do put the truth of this inference out of doubt.","It is true, the apostle said, that he had the sentence of death in himself, that he might not trust or hope in himself, but in God that raiseth the dead.",But this was an high pitch; Israel is not always here; there are many things that hinder.,(1.),The imperfection of our graces.,There is no grace perfected in the godly.,"Now it is incident to things defective, to be wanting in their course.","Faith is not perfect; and hence the sensible Christian feels what follows: love is not perfect, and we see what follows; and so of hope and every other grace; their imperfection makes them stagger.",2.,Israel is not yet beyond temptations.,"There is a deal to attend him with temptations, and he has a soul so disabled by sin, that at all times he cannot fix on God that made him, but is apt to be turned aside to lying vanities: the very thing that Jonah was ensnared with (2:8).",3.,"The promising helps that seem to be in other things, are great hindrances to a steady fixing, by hope, on God; there are good frames of heart, enlargements in duties, with other the like, that have through the darkness, and the legality of our spirits been great hindrances to Israel.","Not that their natural tendency is to turn us aside; but our corrupt reason getting the upper hand, and bearing the stroke in judgment, converts our minds and consciences to the making of wrong conclusions upon them.",4.,"Besides, as the mind and conscience, by reason, is oft deluded to draw these wrong conclusions upon our good frames of heart, to the removing of our hope from the right object unto them; so by like reason, are we turned by unwholesome doctrines, and a carnal understanding of the Word, to the very same thing: 'cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water,' Israel, even God's people, are apt to make unto themselves to the forsaking of their God (Jer 2:11-13).","Thus have I gone through the first part of the text, which consists of an exhortation to hope in the Lord.","And have showed you, 1.",The matter contained therein.,2.,Something of the reason of the manner of the phrase.,3.,"And have drawn, as you see, some inferences from it.",[SECOND.,THE REASON URGED TO ENFORCE THE EXHORTATION.],"I now come to the second part of the text, which is a reason urged to enforce the exhortation, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord.'",Why?,'For with the Lord there is mercy.',"There is the reason, let him hope, for there is mercy; let him hope in the Lord, for with him there is mercy.",The reason is full and suitable.,"For what is the ground of despair, but a conceit that sin has shut the soul out of all interest in happiness?","and what is the reason of that, but a persuasion that there is no help for him in God?","Besides, could God do all but show mercy, yet the belief of that ability would not be a reason sufficient to encourage the soul to hope in God.","For the block SIN, which cannot be removed but by mercy, still lies in the way.","The reason therefore is full and suitable, having naturally an enforcement in it, to the exhortation.","And, First.","To touch upon the reason in a way general, and then [Second] to come to it more particularly.","'Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy,' mercy to be bestowed, mercy designed to be bestowed.",1.,Mercy to be bestowed.,This must be the meaning.,"What if a man has never so much gold or silver, or food, or raiment: yet if he has none to communicate, what is the distressed, or those in want, the better?","What if there be mercy with God, yet if he has none to bestow, what force is there in the exhortation, or what shall Israel, if he hopeth, be the better.","But God has mercy to bestow, to give.","'He saith on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David' (Acts 13:34).","And again, 'The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus' (2 Tim 1:16).","Now then, here lies the encouragement.",The Lord has mercy to give; he has not given away ALL his mercy; his mercy is not clean gone for ever (Psa 77:8).,"He has mercy yet to give away, yet to bestow upon his Israel.","'Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy.'",2.,"As there is with God mercy to be bestowed, so there is mercy designed to be bestowed or given to Israel.","Some men lay by what they mean to give away, and put that in a bag by itself, saying, This I design to give away, this I purpose to bestow upon the poor.",Thus God; he designeth mercy for his people (Dan 9:4).,"Hence the mercy that God's Israel are said to be partakers of, is a mercy kept for them.","And 'thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor,' and laid up for them (Psa 68:10).","This is excellent and is true, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord, for there is with him mercy,' kept, prepared, and laid up for them!",(Psa 61:7).,"When God designs the bestowing of mercy, we may well hope to be partakers (Psa 31:19).","The poor will go merrily to weddings and funerals, and hope for an alms all the way they go, when they come to understand that there is so much kept, prepared, and laid up for them by the bridegroom, &c.[18] But 'He keepeth mercy for thousands!'",(Exo 34:7).,3.,"As God has mercies to bestow, and as he has designed to bestow them, so those mercies are no fragments or the leavings of others: but mercies that are full and complete to do for thee, what thou wantest, wouldst have, or canst desire.","As I may so say, God has his bags that were never yet untied, never yet broken up, but laid by him through a thousand generations, for those that he commands to hope in his mercy.","As Samuel kept the shoulder for Saul, and as God brake up that decreed place for the sea, so hath he set apart, and will break up his mercy for his people: mercy and grace that he gave us before we had a being, is the mercy designed for Israel (2 Tim 1:9).","Whole mercies are allotted to us; however, mercy sufficient (1 Sam 9:23-24; Job 38:10).",But to be a little more distinct.,"[Second, particularly.]","I find that the goodness of God to his people is diversely expressed in his word: sometimes by the word grace; sometimes by the word love; and sometimes by the word mercy; even as our badness against him is called iniquity, transgression, and sin.","When it is expressed by that word 'grace,' then it is to show that what he doth is of his princely will, his royal bounty, and sovereign pleasure.","When it is expressed by that word 'love,' then it is to show us that his affection was and is in what he doth, and that he doth what he doth for us, with complacency and delight.","But when it is set forth to us under the notion of 'mercy,' then it bespeaks us to be in a state both wretched and miserable, and that his bowels and compassions yearn over us in this our fearful plight.","Now, the Holy Ghost chooseth--as it should seem--in this place, to present us with that goodness that is in God's heart towards us, rather under the term of mercy; for that, as I said before, it so presenteth us with our misery, and his pity and compassion; and because it best pleaseth us when we apprehend God in Christ as one that has the love of compassion and pity for us.","Hence we are often presented with God's goodness to us to cause us to hope, under the name of pity and compassion.","'In his pity he redeemed them,' and 'like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him' (Isa 63:9; Psa 103:13).","'The Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy,' he also is gracious and 'full of compassion' (James 5:11; Psa 78:38).","'Thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion,' and thy 'compassions fail not' (Psa 86:15, 111:4; Lam 3:22).","The words being thus briefly touched upon, I shall come to treat of two things.","FIRST, more distinctly, I shall show you what kind of mercy is with the Lord, as a reason to encourage Israel to hope.","SECONDLY, And then shall show what is to be inferred from this reason, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy.'","[FIRST, The kind of mercy that Israel is to hope for.]","First, 'With him there is TENDER MERCY, and therefore let Israel hope' (Psa 25:6, 103:4, 119:156).","Tender mercy is mercy in mercy, and that which Israel of old had in high estimation, cried much for, and chose that God would deal with their souls by that.","'Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me,' said David, and 'according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions' (Psa 40:11, 51:1).","And again, 'Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live' (Psa 119:77).","Now of this sort of mercies God has a great many, a multitude to bestow upon his people.","And they are thus mentioned by the word, to cause us to hope in him.","And is not this alluring, is not this enticing to the Israel of God to hope, when the object of their hope is a God 'very pitiful, and of tender mercy?'","Yea, a God whose tender mercies are great and many.",There are two things that this word tender mercy importeth.,1.,"The first is, that sin will put a believer, if he giveth way thereto, into a very miserable condition.",2.,"That God would have them hope, that though sin may have brought any of them into this condition, the Lord will restore them with much pity and compassion.","'Let Israel hope in the Lord,' for with the Lord there is mercy, tender mercy.",1.,"For the first of these, That sin will put a believer, if he gives way thereto, into a very miserable condition, and that upon a double account.",(1.),For that it will bring him into fears of damnation.,(2.),In that it will make his soul to be much pained under those fears.,"We will wave the first, and come to the second of these.","The pains that guilt will make, when it wounds the conscience, none knows but those to whom sin is applied by the Spirit of God, in the law.","Yet all may read of it in the experience of the godly; where this pain is compared to a wound in the flesh, to fire in the bones, to the putting of bones out of joint, and the breaking of them asunder (Psa 38:3,5,7,8, 102:3, 22:14; Lam 1:13, 3:4).","He that knows what wounds and broken bones are, knows them to be painful things.","And he that knows what misery sin will bring the soul into with its guilt, will conclude the one comes no whit short of the other.","But now he that hath these wounds, and also these broken bones, the very thoughts of a man that can cure, and of a bonesetter, will make him afraid, yea, quake for fear; especially if he knows that though he has skill, he has a hard heart, and fingers that are like iron.","He that handleth a wound, had need have fingers like feathers or down; to be sure the patient wisheth they were!","Tenderness is a thing of great worth to such; and such men are much inquired after by such; yea, their tenderness is an invitation to such to seek after them.",And the thing is true in spirituals (Isa 42:3).,"Wherefore David cried, as I said before, 'Have mercy upon me, O God!","according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions' (Psa 51:1).","O handle me tenderly, Lord, handle me tenderly, cried David.","O cure me, I beseech thee, and do it with thy tender mercy.","Now, answerable to this, the Lord is set forth to Israel, as one with whom is mercy, consequently tender mercy.","Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is tender mercy.","God therefore would have the wounded and bruised, and those whose pains may be compared to the pains and pangs of broken bones, to hope that he will restore them with much pity and compassion, or as you have it before, in pity and tender mercy.",See how he promiseth to do it by the prophet.,'A bruised reed shall he not break; and the smoking flax shall he not quench' (Isa 42:3).,See how tender he is in the action.,"'When he saw him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him' (Luke 10:33-35).",Every circumstance is full of tenderness and compassion.,"See also how angry he maketh himself with those of his servants that handle the wounded or diseased without this tenderness; and how he catcheth them out of their hand, with a purpose to deal more gently with them himself.","'The diseased,' saith he, 'have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick; neither have ye bound up that which was broken; neither have ye brought again that which was driven away; neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them; therefore, ye shepherds, hear the words of the Lord: I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord God.","I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick' (Eze 34:4,7,15,16).","Here is encouragement to hope, even according to the reason urged: 'Let Israel hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy,' tender mercy.",Second.,"As with him is mercy tender, so there is with him mercy that is GREAT, for with him is great mercy.","'The Lord is long-suffering, and of great mercy' (Num 14:18).","When tenderness accompanies want of skill, the defect is great; but when tenderness and great skill meet together, such a surgeon is a brave accomplished man.","Besides, some are more plagued with the sense of the greatness of their sins than others are; the devil having placed or fixed the great sting there.","These are driven by the greatness of sin into despairing thoughts, hotter than fire: these have the greatness of their sin betwixt God and them, like a great mountain; yea, they are like a cloud that darkeneth the sun and air.","[19] This man stands under Cain's gibbet, and has the halter of Judas, to his own thinking, fastened about his neck.","And now, cries, he, 'GREAT mercy or NO mercy; for little mercy will do me no good'; such a poor creature thus expostulateth the case with God, 'Wilt thou show wonders to the dead?",Shall the dead arise and praise thee?',(Psa 88:10).,"Lord, I have destroyed myself, can I live?","My sins are more than the sands, can I live?","Lord, every one of them are sins of the first rate, of the biggest size, of the blackest line, can I live?","I never read that expression but once in all the whole Bible; 'For thy name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great' (Psa 25:11).","Not that there was but one man in Israel that had committed great iniquities, but because men that have so done, have rather inclined to despair, than to an argument so against the wind.","If he had said, Pardon, for they are little, his reason had carried reason in it; but when he saith, Pardon, for they are great, he seems to stand like a man alone.","This is the common language, 'if our transgressions be upon us, and we pine away in them, How should we then live?'",(Eze 33:10).,"Or thus, 'Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off for our parts' (Eze 37:11).","Wherefore to such as these, good wishes, tender fingers, and compassion, without GREAT mercy, can do nothing.","But behold, O thou man of Israel, thou talkest of great sins; answerable to this, the Scripture speaks of great mercy; and thy great sins are but the sins of a man, but these great mercies are the mercies of a God; yea, and thou art exhorted, even because there is mercy with him, therefore to trust thy soul with him, 'let Israel trust in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy,' great mercy.","This therefore is a truth of singular consolation, that mercy is with the Lord, that tender mercy is with him, that great mercy is with him, both TENDER and GREAT.",What would man have more?,"But, Third.","As great mercy is with the Lord to encourage us to hope, so this mercy that is great, is RICH.",'God is rich in mercy' (Eph 2:4).,There is riches of goodness and riches of grace with him (Rom 2:4; Eph 1:7).,"Things may be great in quantity, and little of value; but the mercy of God is not so.","We use to prize small things when great worth is in them; even a diamond as little as a pea, is preferred before a pebble, though as big as a camel.","Why, here is rich mercy, sinner; here is mercy that is rich and full of virtue!",a drop of it will cure a kingdom.,'Ah!,but how much is there of it?',says the sinner.,"O, abundance, abundance!","for so saith the text--'Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord, for his' rich 'mercies are great' (2 Sam 24:14).","Some things are so rich, and of such virtue, that if they do but touch a man, if they do but come nigh a man, if a man doth but look upon them, they have a present operation upon him; but the very mentioning of mercy, yea, a very thought of it, has sometimes had that virtue in it as to cure a sin-sick soul.",Here is virtuous mercy!,"Indeed mercy, the best of mercies, are little worth to a self-righteous man, or a sinner fast asleep; we must not, therefore, make our esteems of mercy according to the judgment of the secure and heedless man, but according to the verdict of the Word; nay, though the awakened sinner, he that roareth for mercy all day long, by reason of the disquietness of his heart is the likeliest among sinful flesh, or as likely as another, to set a suitable estimate upon mercy; yet his verdict is not always to pass in this matter.","None can know the riches of mercy to the full, but he that perfectly knoweth the evil of sin, the justice of God, all the errors of man, the torments of hell, and the sorrows that the Lord Jesus underwent, when mercy made him a reconciler of sinners to God.",But this can be known by none but the God whose mercy it is.,This is the pearl of great price.,The richness of mercy is seen in several things.,"It can save from sin, from great sin, from all sin (Titus 3:5; Matt 15:22,28).","It can save a soul from the devil, from all devils (Matt 17:15,18).","It can save a soul from hell, from all hells (Psa 116:3,5,6).",It can hold us up in the midst of all weaknesses (Psa 94:18).,It can deliver from eternal judgment (Rom 9:23).,"Yea, what is it that we have, or shall need, that this virtuous mercy cannot do for us: 'Let Israel hope in the Lord: for which the Lord is RICH mercy,' mercy full of virtue, and that can do great things.",Fourth.,"As the mercies that are with the Lord are tender, great, and rich, so there is a MULTITUDE of them, and they are called 'manifold,' there is a multitude of these rich and virtuous mercies (Psa 69:13; Rev 9:19).","By multitude, I understand mercies of every sort or kind; mercies for this, and mercies for the other malady; mercies for every sickness, a salve for every sore.","Some things that are rich and very full of virtue, have yet their excellency extending itself but to one, or two, or three things for help; and this is their leanness in the midst of their excellencies.",But it is not thus with the mercy of God.,"Some things that are rich and virtuous, are yet so only but at certain seasons; for there are times in which they can do nothing.","But it is not so with this tender, great, and rich mercy of God.","There are some things, though rich, that are sparingly made use of.",But it is not so with this mercy of God.,There is a multitude of them; so if one will not another will.,There is a multitude of them; so one or other of them is always in their season.,There is a multitude of them; and therefore it must not be supposed that God is niggardly as to the communicating of them.,"As they are called a multitude, so they are called mercies manifold.","There is no single flower in God's gospel-garden, they are all double and treble; there is a wheel within a wheel, a blessing within a blessing, in all the mercies of God.","Manifold; a man cannot receive one, but he receives many, many folded up, one within another.","For instance, 1.","If a man receiveth Christ, who is called God's tender mercy; why, he shall find in him all the promises, pardons, justifications, righteousnesses, and redemptions, that are requisite to make him stand clear before the justice of the law, in the sight of God, from sin (Luke 1:76-79; 1 Cor 1:30; Eph 4:32; 2 Cor 1:20).",2.,"If a man receive the Spirit, he shall have as folded up in that, for this is the first unfolding itself, many, very many mercies (Ezra 1:4).","He shall have the graces, the teachings, the sanctifications, the comforts, and the supports of the Spirit: When he saith in one place, 'He will give the Spirit,' he calleth that in another place, 'the good things' of God (Luke 11:13; Matt 7:11).",3.,"If a man receive the mercy of the resurrection of the body, and God's people shall assuredly receive that in its time, what a bundle of mercies will be received, as wrapt up in that?","He will receive perfection, immortality, heaven, and glory; and what is folded up in these things, who can tell?","I name but these three, for many more might be added, to show you the plenteousness, as well as the virtuousness of the tender, great, and rich mercy of God.",A multitude!,"There is converting mercy, there is preserving mercy, there is glorifying mercy: and how many mercies are folded up in every one of these mercies, none but God can tell.",A multitude!,"There are mercies for the faithful followers of Christ, for those of his that backslide from him, and also for those that suffer for him; and what mercies will by these be found folded up in their mercies, they will better know when they come to heaven.","A multitude of preventing mercies in afflictions, in disappointments, in cross providences, there are with God: and what mercies are folded up in these afflicting mercies, in these disappointing mercies, and in these merciful cross providences, must rest in the bosom of him to be revealed, who only is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.","A multitude of common mercies; of every day's mercies, of every night's mercies, of mercies in relations, of mercies in food and raiment, and of mercies in what of these things there is; and who can number them?","David said, He daily was loaded with God's benefits.","And I believe, if, as we are bound, we should at all times return God thanks for all particular mercies, particularly, it would be a burden intolerable, and would kill us out of hand!",(Psa 68:19).,"And all this is written, that Israel might hope in the Lord: 'Let Israel hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy.'",Fifth.,"As the mercies that are with the Lord are tender, great, rich, a multitude, and manifold; so they are mercies that DIMINISH NOT in the using, but that rather increase in the exercising of them.","Hence it is said, grace aboundeth, and hath abounded unto many; and that God is able to make all grace abound towards us (Rom 5:15; 2 Cor 9:8; Eph 1:7,8).","The grace of forgiveness I mean, wherein he hath abounded towards us.","Now, to abound, is to flow, to multiply, to increase, to greaten, to be more and more; and of this nature is the mercy that is with the Lord; mercy that will abound and increase in the using.","Hence he is said to pardon abundantly, to pardon and multiply to pardon: and, again, to exercise loving-kindness; to exercise it, that is, to draw it out to the length; to make the best advantage and improvement of every grain and quality of it (Isa 55:7; Jer 9;24).","'The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth' (Exo 34:6).","Mercy to a man under guilt, and fear of hell-fire, seems as a little, shrunk-up, or shrivelled thing; there appears no quantity in it.","There is mercy, said Cain, but there is not enough; and he died under that conceit (Gen 4:13).",Nor is it as to judgment and thought many times much better with the Israel of God.,"But behold when God sets mercy to work, it is like the cloud that at first was but like a man's hand, it increaseth until it hath covered the face of heaven.","Many have found it thus, yea they have found it thus in their distress (1 Kings 18:41-44).","Paul has this expression, 'The grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant,' that is, increased towards me exceedingly (1 Tim 1:13-15).","And this is the cause of that change of thoughts that is wrought at last in the hearts of the tempted; at first they doubt, at last they hope; at first they despair, at last they rejoice; at first they quake, while they imagine how great their sins are, and how little the grace of God is; but at last they see such a greatness, such a largeness, such an abundance of increase, in this multiplying mercy of God, that with gladness of heart, for their first thoughts, they call themselves fools, and venture their souls, the next world, and their interest in it, upon this mercy of God.","I tell you, Sirs, you must not trust your own apprehensions nor judgments with the mercy of God; you do not know how he can cause it to abound; that which seems to be short and shrunk up to you, he can draw out, and cause to abound exceedingly.","There is a breadth, and length, and depth, and height therein, when God will please to open it; that for the infiniteness can swallow up not only all thy sins, but all thy thoughts and imaginations, and that can also drown thee at last.","'Now unto him that is able,' 'as to mercy,' 'to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.",Amen!',"(Eph 3:20,21).","This, therefore, is a wonderful thing, and shall be wondered at to all eternity; that that river of mercy, that at first did seem to be but ankle deep, should so rise, and rise, and rise, that at last it became 'waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over!'",(Eze 47:3-5).,"Now all this is written, that Israel might hope.",'Let Israel hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy.',Sixth.,"As there are with God mercies, tender, great, rich, a multitude, and mercy that abounds; so to encourage us to trust in him, there is mercy to COMPASS US ROUND ABOUT.","'Many sorrows shall be to the wicked, but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about' (Psa 32:10).","This is, therefore, the lot of the Israel of God, that they shall, they trusting in their God, be compassed with mercy round about.","This is mercy to do for us in this world, that we may arrive safely in that world which is to come.","Another text saith, 'For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield' (Psa 5:12).",As with a shield.,"This compassing of them, therefore, is, to the end they may be defended and guarded from them that seek their hurt.","When Elisha was in danger, by reason of the army of the Syrians, 'behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire, round about him,' to deliver him (2 Kings 6:15-17).","Round about on every side; or as David hath it, 'Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side' (Psa 71:21).","'I will encamp about mine house,' saith God, 'because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and him that returneth' (Zech 9:1).","This, therefore, is the reason why, notwithstanding all our weaknesses, and also the rage of Satan, we are kept and preserved in a wicked world; we are compassed round about.","Hence, when God asked Satan concerning holy Job, he answered, 'Hast thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side?'",(Job 1:10).,"I cannot come at him; thou compassest him, and keepest me out.","By this, then, is that scripture opened, 'Thou art my hiding-place, thou shalt preserve me from trouble, thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance' (Psa 32:7).","And, indeed, it would be comely, if we, instead of doubting and despairing, did sing in the ways of the Lord: have we not cause thus to do, when the Lord is round about us with sword and shield, watching for us against the enemy, that he may deliver us from their hand?",(Jer 31:12).,"This also is the reason why nothing can come at us, but that it may do us good.","If the mercy of God is round about us, about us on every side; then no evil thing can by any means come at us, but it must come through this mercy, and so must be seasoned with it, and must have its deadly poison, by it, taken away.","Hence Paul, understanding this, saith, 'And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God' (Rom 8:28).","But how can that be, did they not come to us through the very sides of mercy?","and how could they come to us so, since Satan pryeth to wound us deadly in every, or in some private place, if mercy did not compass us round about, round about as with a shield?","He went round about Job, to see by what hog-hole he might get at him, that he might smite him under the fifth rib.","[20] But, behold, he found he was hedged out round about; wherefore he could not come at him but through the sides of mercy; and, therefore, what he did to him must be for good.","Even thus also shall it be in conclusion with all the wrath of our enemies, when they have done what they can; by the mercy of God, we shall be made to stand.","'Why boasteth thou thyself in mischief,' said David, 'O mighty man?",the goodness of God endureth continually' (Psa 52:1).,And that will sanctify to me whatever thou doest against me!,"This, therefore, is another singular encouragement to Israel to hope in the Lord; for that there is with him mercy to compass us round about.","Here is, I say, room for hope, and for the exercise thereof; when we feel ourselves after the worst manner assaulted.","'Wherefore should I fear,' said David, 'in the day of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?'",(Psa 49:5).,Wherefore?,"Why now there is all the reason in the world to fear the day of evil is come upon thee, and the iniquity of thy heels doth compass thee about.","The hand of God is upon thee, and thy sins, which are the cause, stand round about thee, to give in evidence against thee; and therefore thou must fear.","No, saith David, that is not a sufficient reason; he that trusteth in the Lord, Mercy shall compass him about.","Here is ground also to pray in faith, as David, saying, 'Keep me as the apple of the eye, hid me under the shadow of thy wings, from the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about' (Psa 17:8,9).",Seventh.,"As all this tender, great, rich, much abounding mercy, compasseth us about; so that we may hope in the God of our mercy, it is said this mercy IS TO FOLLOW US.","'Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever' (Psa 23:6).","It shall follow me, go with me, and be near me, in all the way that I go (Psa 32:8).","There are these six things to be gathered out of this text, for the further support of our hope.",1.,It shall follow us to guide us in the way.,"I will guide thee with mine eye, says God, that is, in the way that thou shalt go.","The way of man to the next world, is like the way from Egypt to Canaan, a way not to be wound out but by the pillar of a cloud by day, and a flame of fire by night; that is, with the Word and Spirit.","'Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory' (Psa 73:24).",Thou shalt guide me from the first step to the last that I shall take in this my pilgrimage: Goodness and mercy shall follow me.,2.,"As God in mercy will guide, so by the same he will uphold our goings in his paths.","We are weak, wherefore though the path we go in were never so plain, yet we are apt to stumble and fall.","But 'when I said my foot slippeth, thy mercy, O Lord, held me up' (Psa 94:18).","Wherefore we should always turn our hope into prayer, and say, Lord, 'hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not' (Psa 17:5).",Be not moved; let mercy follow me.,3.,"As the God of our mercy has mercy to guide us, and uphold us; so by the same will he instruct us when we are at a loss, at a stand.","'I led Israel about,' says God, 'I instructed him, and kept him as the apple of mine eye' (Deut 32:10).","I say we are often at a loss; David said, after all his brave sayings, in Psalm 119, 'I have gone astray like a lost sheep: seek thy servant' (v 176).","Indeed a Christian is not so often out of the way, as he is at a stand therein, and knows not what to do.",But here also is his mercy as to that.,"'Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left' (Isa 30:21).",Mercy follows for this.,4.,Mercy shall follow to carry thee when thou art faint.,We have many fainting and sinking fits as we go.,"'He shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom,' or upon eagles' wings (Isa 40:11).","He made Israel to ride on the high places of the earth, and made him to suck honey out of the rock (Deut 32:13).",5.,"Mercy shall follow us, to take us up when we are fallen, and to heal us of those wounds that we have caught by our falls.","'The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down' (Psa 145:14).",And again: 'The Lord openeth the yes of the blind; the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down; the Lord loveth the righteous' (Psa 146:8).,"Or, as we have it in another place, 'The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord; and he delighteth in his way.","Though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down; for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand' (Psa 37:23,24).",Here is mercy for a hoping Israelite; and yet this is not all.,6.,Mercy shall follow us to pardon our sins as they are committed.,"For though by the act of justification, we are for ever secured from a state of condemnation; yet as we are children, we need forgiveness daily, and have need to pray, 'Our Father, forgive us our trespasses.'","Now, that we may have daily forgiveness for our daily sins and trespasses, mercy and goodness must follow us; or as Moses has it, 'And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord!","let my Lord, I pray thee, go amongst us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance' (Exo 34:9).","Join to this that prayer of his, which you find in Numbers: 'Now I beseech thee let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, The Lord is long-suffering and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.","Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now,' or hitherto (Num 14:17-19).","How many times, think you, did Israel stand in need of pardon, from Egypt, until they came to Canaan?","Even so many times wilt thou need pardon from the day of thy conversion to the day of death; to the which God will follow Israel, that he may dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.",Eighth.,"As all this tender, great, rich, abounding, compassing mercy, shall follow Israel to do him good; so shall it do him EVERY GOOD TURN, in delivering of him from every judgment that by sin he hath laid himself obnoxious to, with rejoicing.",For 'mercy rejoiceth against judgment' (James 2:13).,"That is, applying it to the mercy of God towards his, it rejoiceth in delivering us form the judgments that we have deserved; yea, it delivereth us from all our woes with rejoicing.",In the margin it is 'glorieth'; it glorieth in doing this great thing for us.,"I have thought, considering how often I have procured judgments and destructions to myself, that God would be weary of pardoning, or else that he would pardon with grudging.","But the Word said, 'He fainteth not nor is weary' (Isa 40;28).","'I will rejoice over them to do them good,--with my whole heart, and with my whole soul' (Jer 32:41).","This doing of us good with rejoicing, this saving of us from deserved judgments with rejoicing, this getting the victory over our destructions for us, with rejoicing; O!",it is a marvellous thing!,"'O sing unto the Lord a new song, for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory'; the victory for us (Psa 98:1).","And as Paul said, 'We are more than conquerors through him' (Rom 8:37); and this he did with triumph and rejoicing (Col 2:15).","The heart is seen oft-times, more in the manner than in the act that is acted; more in the manner of doing than in doing of the thing.",The wickedness of the heart of Moab was more seen in the manner of action than in the words that he spake against Israel.,'For since thou spakest [of] against him thou skippedst for joy' (Jer 48:27).,"So Edom rejoiced at the calamity of his brother; he looked on it and rejoiced: and in his rejoicing appeared the badness of his heart, and the great spite that he had against his brother Jacob (Oba 10:14).","Now, my brethren, I beseech you consider, that God hath not only showed you mercy, but hath done it with rejoicing.","Mercy doth not only follow you, but it follows you with rejoicing: yea, it doth not only prevent your ruin, by our repeated transgressions procured, but it doth it with rejoicing.","Here is the very heart of mercy seen, in that it rejoiceth against judgment.","Like unto this is that in Zephaniah: 'The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty: he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy, he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing' (Zeph 3:17,18).","There are many things that show with what an heart mercy is of God extended, as is afore described, to Israel for his salvation; but this, that it acteth with rejoicing, that it saveth with rejoicing, and gets the victory over judgment with rejoicing!","is a wonderful one, and one that should be taken notice of by Israel, for his encouragement to hope.","'Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with him there is mercy,' tender, great, rich, multiplying mercy, mercy that compasseth us about, that goeth with us all the way, and mercy that rejoiceth to overcome every judgment that seeketh our destruction, as we go toward our Father's house and kingdom!","It is said in the Word, God delighteth in mercy.","'Who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?","he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy' (Micah 7:18).",Here then is a reason of the rejoicing of mercy against judgment.,"Why, mercy is God's delight; or, as another hath it, 'Mercy pleaseth thee.'","What a man delights in, that he will set on foot, and that he will seek to manage, that he will promote, and that he will glory in the success and prosperity of.","Why, the text saith, God delighteth in mercy: nor do I believe, how odious soever the comparison may seem to be, that ever man delighteth more in sin, than God hath delighted in showing mercy.",Has man given himself for sin?,"God has given his Son for us, that he might show us mercy (John 3:16).",Has man lain at wait for opportunities for sin?,"God has waited to be gracious, that he might have mercy upon us (Isa 30:10).","Has man, that he might enjoy his sin, brought himself to a morsel of bread?","Why Christ, Lord of all, that he might make room for mercy, made himself the poorest man (Luke 9:58; 2 Cor 8:9).","Has man, when he has found his sin, pursued it with all his heart?","Why God, when he sets a showing mercy, shows it with rejoicing, for he delighteth in mercy.",Here also you may see the reason why all God's paths are mercy and truth to his (Psa 25:10).,"I have observed that what a man loveth he will accustom himself unto, whether it be fishing, hunting, or the like.","These are his ways, his course, the paths wherein he spends his life, and therefore he is seldom found out of one or another of them.","'Now,' saith David, 'all the paths of the Lord are mercy' (Psa 25:10).","He is never out of them: for wherever he is, still he is coming towards his Israel in one or other of these paths, stepping steps of mercy.",Hence again it is that you find that at the end of every judgment there is mercy; and that God in the midst of this remembers that (Habb 2:3).,"Yea, judgment is in mercy; and were it not for that, judgment should never overtake his people (1 Cor 11:32).","Wherefore let Israel hope in the Lord, seeing with him is all this mercy.",Ninth.,"Besides all this, the mercy that is with God, and that is an encouragement to Israel to hope in him, IS EVERLASTING: 'The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him' (Psa 103:17).","From everlasting to everlasting; that is more, more than I said.","Well, 1.","Then from everlasting; that is, from before the world began; so then, things that are, and are to be hereafter, are to be managed according to those measures that God in mercy took for his people then.","Hence it is said, that he has blessed us according as he chose us in Christ, before the world began; that is, according to those measures and grants that were by mercy allotted to us then (Eph 1:4).","According to that other saying, 'according to his mercy he saved us,' that is, according as mercy had allotted for us before the world began (Titus 3:5).","'According to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ before the world began' (2 Tim 1:9).","This is mercy from everlasting, and is the ground and bottom of all dispensations that have been, are, or are to come to his people.","And now, though it would be too great a step to a side, to treat of all those mercies that of necessity will be found to stand upon that which is called mercy from everlasting, yet it will be to our purpose, and agreeable to our method, to conclude that mercy to everlasting stands upon that; even as vocation, justification, preservation, and glorification, standeth upon our being chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world (Rom 8:29,30).",Here then is the mercy that is with God and that should encourage Israel to hope.,"The mercy that has concerned itself with them, is mercy from everlasting.","Nor may it be thought that a few quarrels of some brain-sick fellows will put God upon taking new measures for his people; what foundation has been laid for his, before he laid the foundation of the world, shall stand; for that it was laid in Christ by virtue of mercy: that is, from everlasting (Rom 9:11).","The old laws, which are the Magna Charta, the sole basis of the government of a kingdom, may not be cast away for the pet that is taken by every little gentleman against them.","[21] We have indeed some professors that take a great pet against that foundation of salvation, that the mercy that is from everlasting has laid; but since the kingdom, government, and glory of Christ is wrapped up in it, and since the calling, justification, perseverance, and glorification of his elect, which are called his body and fulness, is wrapt up therein, it may not be laid aside nor despised, nor quarrelled against by any, without danger of damnation.","Here then is the mercy with which Israel is concerned, and which is with God as an encouragement to them that should hope, to hope in him.",It is mercy from everlasting; it is mercy of an ancient date; it is mercy in the root of the thing.,For it is from this mercy in the root of the thing.,"For it is from this mercy, this mercy from everlasting, that all, and all those sorts of mercies, of which we have discoursed before, do flow.","It is from this that Christ the Saviour flows; this is it, from which that tender mercy, that great mercy, that rich mercy that aboundeth towards us, doth flow; and so of all the rest.","Kind brings forth its kind; know the tree by his fruit; and God by his mercy in Christ; yea, and know what God was doing before he made the world, by what he has been doing ever since.","And what has God been doing for and to his church from the beginning of the world, but extending to, and exercising loving-kindness and mercy for them?",therefore he laid a foundation for this in mercy from everlasting.,2.,"But mercy from everlasting is but the beginning, and we have discoursed of those mercies that we have found in the bowels of this already, wherefore a word of that which is to everlasting also.",'From everlasting to everlasting.',"Nothing can go beyond to everlasting; wherefore this, to everlasting, will see an end of all.","The devil will tempt us, sin will assault us, men will persecute; but can they do it to everlasting?","If not, then there is mercy to come to God's people at last; even when all evils have done to us what they can.","After the prophet had spoken of the inconceivable blessedness that God hath prepared for them that wait for him, he drops to present wrath, and the sin of God's people in this life.","This done, he mounts up again to the first, and saith, 'in those is continuance'; that is, the things laid up for us are everlasting, and therefore 'we shall be saved' (Isa 64:4,5).","How many things since the beginning have assaulted the world to destroy it, as wars, famines, pestilences, earthquakes, &c., and yet to this day it abideth.",But what is the reason of that?,"Why, God liveth, upon whose word, and by whose decree it abideth.","'He hath established the earth, and it abideth'; it standeth fast, and 'cannot be moved' (Psa 119:90, 93:1, 96:10).","Why, my brethren, mercy liveth, mercy is everlasting; 'His mercy endureth for ever!'",(Psa 136).,"And therefore the church of God liveth; and when all her enemies have done their all, this is the song that the church shall sing over them: 'They are brought down and fallen, but we are risen, and stand upright!'",(Psa 20:8).,"Everlasting mercy, with everlasting arms, are underneath (Deut 33:27).","And as this shows the cause of the life of the church, notwithstanding her ghostly and bodily enemies, so it showeth the cause of her deliverance from her repeated sins.","As God said of leviathan 'I will not conceal his parts,' &c. (Job 41:12).","So it is very unbecoming of God's people to conceal their sins and miscarriages, for it diminisheth this mercy of God.","Let therefore sin be acknowledged, confessed, and not be hid nor dissembled; it is to the glory of mercy that we confess to God and one another what we are; still remembering this, but mercy is everlasting!","As this shows the reason of our life, and the continuance of that, notwithstanding our repeated sins, so it shows the cause of the receiving [or renewing] of our graces, from so many decays and sickness.","For this mercy will live, last, and outlast, all things that are corruptible and hurtful unto Israel.","Wherefore 'let Israel hope in the Lord,' for this reason, 'for with the Lord there is mercy.'",1.,Tender mercy for us.,2.,Great mercy for us.,3.,Rich mercy.,4.,Manifold mercy.,5.,Abounding mercy towards us.,6.,Compassing mercy wherewith we are surrounded.,7.,Mercy to follow us wherever we go.,8.,Mercy that rejoiceth against judgment.,"And, 9.",Mercy that is from everlasting to everlasting.,"All these mercies are with God, to allure, to encourage, and uphold Israel in hope.",[SECOND.,What is to be inferred from this reason.],"I come now to the second thing, which is to show what is to be inferred from this reason.","And, First.","This, to be sure, is to be inferred, That Israel, as the child of God, is a pitiful thing of himself; one that is full of weaknesses, infirmities, and defects, should we speak nothing of his transgressions.","He that is to be attended with so many mercies, absolutely necessary mercies, for there is not in these mercies one that can be spared, must needs be in himself a poor indigent creature.","Should you see a child attended with so many engines to make him go, as the child of God is attended with mercies to make him stand, you would say, What an infirm, decrepit, helpless thing is this!",[22] Alas!,I have here counted up mercies in number nine.,"If I had counted up nine hundred and ninety-nine, all had been the same, for the child of God would not have one to spare.","The text saith, 'The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy,' and all little enough to preserve his Israel (Psa 119:64).","Indeed, those that I have presented the reader with are the chief heads of mercies; or the head-mercies from which many others flow.","But, however, were they but single mercies, they show with great evidence our deficiency; but being double, they show it much more.","Should it be said there is such a lord has a son, a poor decrepit thing; he is forced to wear things to strengthen his ancles, things to strengthen his knees, things to strengthen his loins, things to keep up his bowels, things to strengthen his shoulders, his neck, his hands, fingers; yea, he cannot speak but by the help of an engine, nor chew his food but by the help of an engine.",What would you say?,What would you think?,"Would you not say such a one is not worth the keeping, and that his father cannot look for any thing from him, but that he should live upon high charge and expense, as long as he liveth; besides all the trouble such an one is like to be of to others.","Why this is the case: Israel is such an one, nay, a worse.","He cannot live without tender mercy, without great mercy, without rich mercy, without manifold mercy and unless mercy abounds towards him.","He cannot stand if mercy doth not compass him round about, nor go unless mercy follows him.","Yea, if mercy that rejoiceth against judgment doth not continually flutter over him, the very moth will eat him up, and the canker will consume him (Job 4:19).","Wherefore it is necessary to the making of Israel live and flourish, that everlasting mercy should be over his head, and everlasting mercy under his feet, with all the afore-mentioned mercies, and more in the bowels of it.","But I say doth not this sufficiently show, had we but eyes to see it, what a sad and deplorable creature the child of God of himself is?",O!,this is not believed nor considered as it should.,"Vain man would be wise; sinful man would be holy; and poor, lame, infirm, helpless man, would be strong, and fain persuade others that he hath a sufficiency of himself.","But I say, if it be so, what need all this mercy?","If thou canst go lustily, what mean thy crutches?","No, no, Israel, God's Israel, when awake, stands astonished at his being surrounded with mercies, and cries out, 'I am not worthy of the least [I am less than the least] of all thy mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant' (Gen 32:10).",Second.,This also showeth how sorely the enemies of Israel are bent to seek his destruction.,"The devil is, by way of eminency, called the enemy of God's people: 'the devil, your adversary' (1 Peter 5:8).","And this, that there are so many mercies employed about us, and all to bring us to the place which God hath appointed for us, doth demonstrate it.","Should you see a man that was not to go from door to door, but he must be clad in a coat of mail, must have a helmet of brass upon is head, and for his life-guard not so few as a thousand men to wait upon him; would you not say, Surely this man has store of enemies at hand, surely this man goes continually in danger of his life?","Why, this is the case, enemies lie in wait for poor Israel in every hole; he can neither eat, drink, wake, sleep, work, sit still, talk, be silent; worship his God in public or in private, but he is in danger of being stabbed, or being destroyed.","Hence, as was said before, he is compassed about with mercy as with a shield (Micah 7:20).","And again it is said concerning these, 'God's truth,' his mercy, 'shall be thy shield and buckler' (Psa 91:4).","And again, 'He is a buckler to all them that trust in him' (2 Sam 22:31).","Yea, David being a man sensible of his own weakness, and of the rage and power of his enemies, cries out to his God to take hold of shield and buckler, and to stand up for his help (Psa 35:2).","But what need these things be asserted, promised, or prayed for?","if Israel had no enemies, or none but such, he could, as we say, make his party good with all.","Alas, their cries, their tears, sighs, watchings, and outcries, at sundry times, make this, beyond all show of doubt, a truth.","If Solomon used to have about his bed no less than threescore of the valiantest of Israel, holding swords, and being expert in war, every one with his sword upon his thigh, because of fear in the night--and yet these fears were only concerning men--what guard and safe-guard doth God's poor people need, who are continually, both night and day, roared upon by the unmerciful fallen angels of hell!","(Can 3:7,8).","I will add, if it be but duly considered, all this guard and safeguard by mercy notwithstanding, how hardly this people do escape being destroyed for ever, yea, how with hearts broken, and loins broken, many of them with much difficulty get to the gates of heaven!","it will be easily concluded, that her enemies are swifter than eagles, stronger than lions; and that they often overtake her between the straits.","To say nothing of the many thousands that dare not so much as once think of true religion, because of the power of the enemy which they behold, when alas!","they see nobody but the very scarecrows which the devil hath set up for I count the persecutor of God's people but the devil's scarecrow, the old one himself lies quat--yet, I say, how are they frighted!",how are they amazed!,What a many of the enemies of religion have these folks seen today!,"[23] yea, and they will as soon venture to run the hazard of hell-fire, as to be engaged by these enemies in this way.","Why, God's people are fain to go through them all, and yet no more able than the other to do it of themselves.","They therefore are girded, compassed, and defended by this mercy, which is the true cause indeed of their godly perseverance.",Third.,"A third thing that I infer from these words is, What a loving God has Israel!",'Truly God is good to Israel.,Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.',"A loving God, that should take this care of him, and bestow so many mercies upon him.","Mercies of all sorts, for all cases, for all manner of relief and help against all manner of perils.","What is man that God should so unweariedly attend upon him, and visit him every moment?",Is he a second God?,Is he God's fellow?,Is he of the highest order of the angels?,or what is he?,O!,"he is a flea, a worm, a dead dog, sinful dust and ashes; he comes up like a flower and is cut down, and what a thing is it that God should so much as open his eyes upon such a one!","(1 Sam 26:20; Job 25:6, 45:2,3).","But then, what a thing is it that God should magnify him, and that he should set his heart upon him!",(Job 7:17).,"Yea, that he should take him into acquaintance with him, give his angels to be all ministering spirits for him!","Yea, engage his mercy for him, his tender, great, manifold, and everlasting mercy for him, to compass him round withal, as with a shield, that nothing might work his ruin for ever and ever!","It may well be said, 'God is love'!",(1 John 4:16).,"Man may well say so, 'O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever.","Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy' (Psa 107:1-3).","If it be love for a fellow-creature to give a bit of bread, a coat, a cup of cold water, what shall we call this?","when God, the great God, the former of all things, shall not only give an alms, an alms to an enemy, but shall rise up, take shield and buckler, and be a guard, a protection, a deliverer from all evil, until we come into his heavenly kingdom?","This love is such as is not found on earth, nor to be paralleled among the creatures.",None hopes this but one that is good.,"Nor does any believe as they should, that God doth love as these things declare he does.","Our heart staggereth at the greatness of the thing, and who is it that has any reason left in him, and knows anything of what a wretched thing sin hath made him, that can without starting so much as hear of all this mercy!","But, Fourth.","Another thing that I infer from these words is this, What ground is here to Israel to hope in the Lord!","The Lord is not that broken reed of Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand and pierce it.","God's word is steadfast for ever, even the word by which we are here exhorted to hope.",Nor shall we have cause to doubt of the cause of the exhortation to such a soul-quieting duty; for mercy is with the Lord: 'Let Israel rejoice in him that made him; let the children of Zion be joyful in their king' (Psa 149:2).,"For with the Lord there is mercy, wherewith to beautify the meek with salvation.","What sayest thou, child of God?","Has sin wounded, bruised thy soul, and broken thy bones?","Why, with the Lord there is tender mercy.","Art thou a sinner of the first rate, of the biggest size?","Why, with the Lord there is great mercy for thee?","Have thy sins corrupted thy wounds, and made them putrefy and stink?","Why, with the Lord there is rich, that is, virtuous[24] mercy for thee.",Art thy sins of diverse sorts?,"Why, here is a multitude of manifold mercies for thee.",Dost thou see thyself surrounded with enemies?,"Why, with the Lord there is mercy to compass thee about withal.",Is the way dangerous in which thou art to go?,Surely goodness and mercy shall follow thee all the days of thy life.,Doth iniquity prevail against thee?,The mercy of this Lord aboundeth towards thee.,Doth judgments for thy miscarriages overtake thee; There is with thy Lord mercy that rejoiceth to deliver thee from those judgments.,What shall I say?,There is mercy from everlasting to everlasting upon thee.,What wouldst thou have?,"There is mercy underneath, mercy above, and mercy for thee on every side; therefore 'let Israel hope in the Lord!'","I will add, it is the greatest unkindness thou canst return to the Lord to doubt this mercy notwithstanding.","Why, what wilt thou make of God?","Is there no truth nor trust to be put in him, notwithstanding all that he hath said?",O the depravedness of man's nature!,"Because he speaketh the truth, therefore we believe him not!",(John 8:45).,"The odiousness of unbelief is manifest by this, yea, also the unreasonableness thereof.","God is true, his Word is true; and to help us to hope in him, how many times has he fulfilled it to others, and that before our eyes?",Hope then; it is good that a man should hope.,Hope then; it pleases God that thou shouldest hope.,"Hope then to the end, for the grace that is to be brought unto thee will surely come, with Christ thy Saviour.","Men that have given up themselves to their sins, hope to enjoy some benefit by them, though the curse of God, and his wrath, is revealed from heaven against them for it (Rom 1:18).","And yet thou that hast given thyself to God by Christ, art afraid to hope in his mercy!","For shame, hope, and do not thus dishonour thy God, would thine own soul, and set so bad an example to others.","I know thou hast thy objections in a readiness to cast in my way, and were they made against doctrine, reason would that some notice should be taken of them;

and there are two sorts of this redemption.","First, Redemption by purchase.","Second, Redemption by power.",Redemption by purchase is from the cause of captivities.,Redemption by power is from the effects.,"First, If we speak of redemption by purchase, then three things present themselves to our consideration--I.",The person redeeming.,II.,The nature of the price paid to redeem withal.,III.,The thing or state from which this redeemer with this price redeemeth.,[I.,The Person redeeming.],"The subject of this redemption, or person redeemed, is Israel, of him we have spoken before.","For the person redeeming, it is Jesus of Nazareth; Jesus that was born at Bethlehem, at the time, and as the Scriptures relate (Matt 1; Luke 2).","Now, with reference to his person, we have two things to inquire after.",What this person was.,How he addressed himself to this work.,1.,What this person was.,"This Jesus was and is the natural and eternal Son of God Almighty, without beginning or end, from everlasting; the Creator and Upholder of the world (Prov 8; John 1; Heb 1).",2.,"How he addressed himself to the work of redeeming, take as follows.","He became true man: for he was conceived through the power of the Holy Ghost in the womb of a maid, and in the fulness of time brought forth of her, true, real, natural man; I say, though not in the worst, yet in the best sense (Luke 2:31-35).","Being thus brought forth without spot or blemish, he began to address himself to the work.",(1.),"By works preparatory, and then, (2.)",By the act itself.,(1.),The works preparatory were as follow.,"He prepares himself a priestly robe, which was his own obediential righteousness; for without these holy garments he might not adventure to come into the presence of God to offer his gift (Rom 5:19; Exo 28:40, 40:13).","Before he offered his gift for the people, he was to be himself sanctified to his office: and that--by blood--by prayers and tears (1 Peter 1:19).",(a.),"By blood; for before Aaron was to offer his sacrifice for the people, he must himself be sprinkled with blood (Exo 29:19-22).","And because Jesus could not be sprinkled with the blood of beasts, therefore was he sprinkled with that of his own: not as Aaron was, upon the tip of his ear, and upon the tip of his toe; but from top to toe, from head to foot, his sweat was blood (Luke 22:44).","So that from his agony in the garden to the place where he was to lay down the price of our redemption, he went as consecrated in his own blood.",(b.),"He offered also his sacrifice of strong crying and tears, as his drink-offering to God, as a sacrifice preparatory, not propitiatory, in pursuit of his office; not to purge his person (Heb 5:5-8).","This is the person redeeming, and this was his preparation to the work.",(2.),The act itself.,"Now the redemption is often ascribed particularly to his blood; yet in general, the act of his redeeming of us must either more remotely or more nearly be reckoned from his whole suffering for us in the flesh; which suffering I take to begin at his agony, and was finished when he was raised again from the dead.","By his flesh I understand his whole man, as distinguished from his Divine nature; and so that word doth comprehend his soul as well as his body, as by the 53rd of Isaiah appears.",His soul after that manner which was proper to it; and his body after that manner which was proper to it.,[II.,The nature of the price paid to redeem.],"His sufferings began in his soul, some time before his body was touched, by virtue of which was his bloody sweat in his body.","The sorrows of his soul began at the apprehension of what was coming from God, for our sakes, upon him; but the bloody sweat of his body was from that union it had with such a soul.","His sufferings were from the hand of God, not of man; not by constraint, but of his own will (Lev 1:3; John 10:18); and they differ from ours in these six things.",1.,His sufferings were by the rigour of the law; ours according to the tenor of the gospel (Gal 3:13; Heb 12:10).,2.,His sufferings were from God's hand immediately; ours by and through a Mediator (Isa 53:6; Heb 9:22).,3.,God delighted himself in every stroke he gave him; he doth not willingly grieve nor afflict his people (Isa 53; Psa 103; Lam 3:33).,4.,He suffereth as a common or public person; we for our own private offences (1 Cor 15:3; Lam 3:39).,5.,"He suffered to make amends to justice for the breach of a holy law; we to receive some small correction, and to be taught to amend our lives (Heb 9:26; Rom 10:3,4; Deut 8:5; 2 chron 6:27).",6.,"He was delivered from the nature of suffering by the merit of his person and sufferings; we from ours by the mercy of God through Christ (Acts 2:24; Eph 4:32, 5:2).","Redemption, then, by a price, was this; the blood of Christ, which he willingly suffered to be spilt on the cross, before the face of God.",[III.,The state from which this price redeemeth.],"The cause of this price was our sins; by which we were justly delivered up to the curse, the devil, death, and hell; and should everlastingly have so continued, but that this price of redemption was for us paid.","Hence it is said, Christ died for us.",Christ died for our sins.,Christ gave himself for our sins.,"We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.",And that we are bought with this price.,"Now, in all this Christ respected the holiness of the law, and the worth of our souls; giving full satisfaction to the one, for the love that he bare to the other.","And this has redeemed his people from sin and the curse, the cause of our captivity.","Second, But besides this, there is redemption by power, and that respecteth that, or those things, unto which we become not legally indebted by our transgression.","There was that unto which we became legally indebted, and that was the justice and holiness of the law (Gen 2:17).","Now from this, because God had said it, for his Word made it so, there could be no deliverance, but by a reverend and due respect to its command and demand, and an answer to every whit of what it would require; for not one tittle, not one jot or tittle of the law could fail (Matt 5:18).","Jesus Christ, therefore, with respect to the law, that he might redeem us, paid a full and sufficient price of redemption; but as for these things that hold us captive, not for any injury we have done to them, but of power, tyranny, or the like; from them he redeemed us by power (Eph 4).","Hence, when he had made satisfaction or amends for us to the law, he is said to 'lead captivity captive, to spoil principalities and powers, and to make a show of them openly' (Col 2).","But to take captive, and to spoil, must be understood of what he did, not to the law, but to those others of our enemies from which we were to be redeemed, not by price but by power.",And this second part of redemption is to be considered under a twofold head.,1.,"That these were overcome personally, in and by himself, for us.",2.,"That they shall be overcome also, in and by his church, through the power of his Spirit.",1.,"For the first, these were overcome personally, in and by himself for us; to wit, at his resurrection from the dead.","For as by his death he made amends for our breach of the law, so by his resurrection he spoiled those other enemies, to wit, death, the devil, and the grave, &c., unto which we were subjected, not for any offence we had committed against them, but for our sin against the law; and men when they have answered to the justice of the law, are by law and power delivered from the prison.","Christ therefore, by power, by his glorious power, did overcome the devil, hell, sin, and death, then when he arose and revived from his grave, and so got the victory over them, in and by himself, for us.","For he engaging as a common or public person for us, did on our behalf what he did, both in his death and resurrection.","So then, as he died for us, he rose for us; and as by his death he redeemed us from some, so by his resurrection from other, of our enemies.","Only it must be considered, that this redemption, as to the fulness of it as yet, resides in his own person only, and is set out to his church as she has need thereof, and that orderly too.","First, that part thereof which respecteth our redemption from the law; and then that part of it which respecteth our redemption from those other things.","And although we are made partakers of redemption from the curse of the law in this life, so far forth as to be justified therefrom; and also as to the receiving of an earnest while here, of being wholly possessed of the glory of the next world hereafter; yet we neither are, nor shall be redeemed from all those things, which yet our head has, as head, got a complete and eternal victory over, until just before he shall deliver up the kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all; for 'the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death' (1 Cor 15:26).","Death, as it has hold upon us, for death as it had hold on our head, was destroyed, when he rose from the dead, but death, as we are subject to it, shall not be destroyed until we all and every one of us shall attain to the resurrection from the dead; a pledge of which we have by our spiritual resurrection, from a state of nature to a state of grace (Col 3:1-4).","A promise of which we have in the word of the truth of the gospel; and an assurance of it we have by the resurrection of Christ from the dead (Eph 4:30; Luke 20:35; Acts 17:30,31).",Wherefore let us hope!,"Now, as to redemption from the law, and from those other things from which we are, and are to be redeemed with power; do but consider the different language which the Holy Ghost useth, with reference to our redemption from each.","When it speaketh of our redemption from the just curse of the law, which we have sufficiently deserved, it is said to be done, not by destroying, but by fulfilling the law.","'Think not,' says Christ, 'that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.","For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled' (Matt 5:17,18).","For it became him, as our Redeemer, to fulfil all, and all manner of righteousness, by doing and suffering what justly should have been done or borne of us (Rom 8:3-5; Gal 3:13,14).","But now when our redemption from those other things is made mention of, the dialect is changed; for then we read, to the end we might be delivered from them, Christ was to destroy and abolish them (2 Tim 1:10); 'that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil,' and so deliver (Heb 2:14).","And again, 'O death, I will be thy plagues!","O grace, I will be thy destruction!'",(Hosea 13:14).,"And again, 'that the body of sin might be destroyed' (Rom 6:6); and I have the keys of hell and of death (Rev 1:18).","Having thereby sufficiently declared that the power of it is destroyed as to Israel, who are the people concerned in this redemption.",2.,They shall be overcome by his church through the power of his Spirit.,"Now, as was hinted before, the redemption is already obtained, and that completely, by the person of Christ for us (Heb 9:24), as it is written, 'Having obtained eternal redemption for us'; yet these enemies, sin, death, the devil, hell, and the grave, are not so under the feet of his [saints] as he will put them, and as they shall be in conclusion under the feet of Christ (Heb 2:8,9).","I say they are not; wherefore, as the text also concludeth, this redemption is with the Lord, and under our feet they shall be by the power of God towards us (2 Cor 13:4).",And for this let Israel hope.,"The sum then is, God's people have with the Lord redemption, and redemption in reversion; redemption, and redemption to come; all which is in the hand of the Lord for us, and of all we shall be possessed in his time.",This is that called plenteous redemption.,'For with him is plenteous redemption.',"A little therefore to touch upon the redemption that we have in reversion, or of the redemption yet to come.",(1.),"There is yet much sin and many imperfections that cleave to our persons and to our performances, from which, though we be not yet in the most full sense delivered, yet this redemption is with our Lord, and we shall have it in his time; and in the meantime it is said, It shall not have dominion over us.","'Sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace' (Rom 6:14).","We are, by what Christ has done, taken from under the law, the curse; and must, by what Christ will do, be delivered from the very being of sin.","'He gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity'; that he might present us to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that we should be without blemish (Titus 2:13,14; Eph 5:25,27).","That we are already without the being of sin, none but fools and madmen will assert; and that we shall never be delivered from it, none but such men will affirm neither.","It remains then, that there is a redemption for Israel in reversion, and that from the being of sin.","And of this it is that the text also discourseth, and for which let the godly hope.",(2.),"We are not yet quite free from Satan's assaulting of us, though our Head by himself, and that for us, has got a complete conquest over him; but the time is coming, and himself knows that it is but a little while to it, in which he shall forever be bruised under our feet.","Be wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil, and the God of peace shall bruise, tread down Satan under your feet shortly (Rom 16:20).","Some may think that this text will have a fulfilling in the ruin and downfall of Antichrist; and so it may; but yet it will never be wholly fulfilled, as long as Satan shall have any thing to do with one of the children of God.","There is therefore a redemption in reversion for the children of God from Satan, which they are to hope for, because this redemption is with the Lord their Head, and that to manage and bring about for them.",For he shall bruise him under their feet in his time.,(3.),"There is yet belonging to the church of God a redemption from what remains of Antichrist, although as yet he is stronger than we, which I also call a redemption in reversion, for that it is yet to come, nor shall it be accomplished till the time appointed.","In this redemption, not only saints, but truths will have a share; yea, and many also of the men that belong not to the kingdom of Christ and of God.","This redemption God's people are also to hope for, for it is with their Lord, and he has promised it to them, as the Scripture doth plentifully declare.",(4.),"There is yet a redemption to come, which is called the redemption of our body (Rom 8:23).","Of this redemption we have both the earnest and the seal, to wit, the Spirit of God (Eph 1:14, 4:30).","And because the time to it is long, therefore we are to wait for it; and because it will be that upon which all our blessedness will be let out to us, and we also let in to it, therefore we should be comforted at all the signs of the near approach thereof; 'then,' saith Christ, 'look up and lift up your heads' (Luke 21:28).","The bodies of saints are called the purchased possession; possession, because the whole of all that shall be saved shall be for a temple or house for God to dwell in, in the heavens.","A purchased possession, because the body, as well as the soul, is bought with the price of blood (1 Cor 6:14-20).",But what then doth he mean by the redemption of this purchased possession?,"I answer, he meaneth the raising it up from the dead; 'I will ransom them from the power of the grave, I will redeem them from death' (Hosea 13:14).","And then shall be brought to pass that saying that is written, 'Death is swallowed up in victory'; that saying, that is this, and that in Isaiah, for they speak both the selfsame thing (1 Cor 15; Isa 25:8).","And this was signified by Moses, where he speaks of the year of jubilee, and of the redemption of the house that was sold in Israel, how of that year it should return to the owner (Lev 25).","Our bodies of right are God's, but sin still dwells in them; we have also sold and forfeited them to death and the grave, and so they will abide; but at the judgment day, that blessed jubilee, God will take our body, which originally is his, and will deliver it from the bondage of corruption, unto which, by our souls, through sin, it has been subjected; he will take it, I say, because it is his, both by creation and redemption, and will bring it to that perfect freedom that is only to be found in immortality and eternal life.",And for this should Israel hope!,"From what hath been said to this first thing, it appears that the mercy that is with God for his people, as it is in general what has been described before, so it is redeeming mercy, or mercy that has with it the virtue of redemption; of the advantageousness of this mercy, we will further discourse by and by, but now we will look into the second thing, that from this amplification of the reason was propounded to be spoken to, to wit, [SECOND.",The sufficiency of this redemption.],An account of the sufficiency of this redemption.,"'Let Israel hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.'","The sufficiency or plenteousness of it may be spoken to, as it respecteth the many difficulties and dangers that by sin we have brought ourselves into; or as it respecteth the superabundant worth that is found therein, let the dangers attending us be what they will, though we should not be acquainted with the half or the hundredth part thereof.","To speak to it as it respecteth those particular difficulties and dangers that by sin we have brought ourselves unto; and that, First.",By showing the suitableness of it.,Second.,By showing the sufficiency of the suitableness thereof.,First.,The suitableness of it lieth in the fit application thereof to all the parts of thraldom and bondage.,Have we sinned?,"Christ had our sins laid upon his back; yea, of God was made, that is, reputed, sin for us (Isa 53; 2 Cor 5:21).",Were we under the curse of the law by reason of sin?,"Christ was made under the law, and bare the curse thereof to redeem (Gal 4:4, 3:13; Rom 3:24).",Had sin set us at an indefinite distance from God?,"Christ has become, by the price of his redeeming blood, a reconciler of man to God again (Col 1:20).",Were we by sin subject to death?,Christ died the death to set us free therefrom (Rom 6:23).,Had our sins betrayed us into and under Satan's slavery?,"Christ has spoiled and destroyed this work, and made us free citizens of heaven (Acts 26:18; 2 Tim 2:26; Heb 2:14; Eph 2:19).","Thus was our Redeemer made, as to those things, a suitable recoverer, taking all and missing nothing that stood in the way of our happiness; according to that a little below the text, 'And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities,' that is, from them, together with their evil fruits.",Second.,"Now as to the sufficiency that was in this suitableness, that is declared by his resurrection, by his ascension, by his exaltation to the right hand of God; that is also declared by God's putting all things under his feet, and by giving of him to be head over all things for his redeemed's sake.","It is also further declared in that God now threateneth none but those that refuse to take Jesus for their Saviour, and for that he is resolved to make his foes his footstool.","What are more natural consequences flowing from anything, than that by these things is the sufficiency of the suitableness of redemption by Christ proved?","For all these things followed Christ, for, or because he humbled himself to the death of the cross, that he might become a Redeemer; therefore God raised him up, took him to his throne, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God by him (Phil 2).",But alas!,"what need we stand to prove the sun is light, the fire hot, the water wet?","What was done by him was done by God, for he was true God; and what comparison can there be betwixt God and the creature, betwixt the worth of God's acts, and the merit of the sin of poor man!","And can death, or sin, or the grave hold us, when God saith, 'Give up?'","Yea, where is that, or he, that shall call into question the superabounding sufficiency that is in the merit of Christ, when God continueth to discharge, day by day, yea, hourly, and every moment, sinners from their sin, and death, and hell, for the sake of the redemption that is obtained for us by Christ?",God be thanked here is plenty; but no want of anything!,Enough and to spare!,"It will be with the merit of Christ, even at the end of the world, as it was with the five loaves and two fishes, after the five thousand men, besides women and children, had sufficiently eaten thereof.","There was, to the view of all at last, more than showed itself at fist.","At first there was but five loaves and two fishes, which a lad carried.","At last there were twelve baskets full, the weight of which, I suppose, not the strongest man could bear away.","Nay, I am persuaded, that at the end of the world, when the damned shall see what a sufficiency there is left of merit in Christ, besides what was bestowed upon them that were saved by him, they will run mad for anguish of heart to think what fools they were not to come to him, and trust in him that they might be saved, as their fellow-sinners did.","But this is revealed that Israel, that the godly may hope and expect.","Let Israel therefore hope in the Lord, for with him is plenteous redemption.",[Amplifying reasons as a conclusion of the whole.],"Now as this last clause, as I termed it, is the amplification of the reason going before; so itself yieldeth amplifying reasons as a conclusion of the whole.","For, First.","Add redemption unto mercy, and then things still are heightened and made greater.","And it must, because the text adds it, and because both the nature of God, the holiness of his law, and the present state of the sinner that is to be saved, requireth that it should be so.","God is justice as well as mercy; the law is holy and just; that man that is to be saved is not only a sinner, but polluted.","Now, then, that mercy and justice may meet and kiss in the salvation of the sinner, there must be a redemption; that the sinner may be saved, and the law retain its sanction and authority, there must be a redemption; that the sinner may be purged as well as pardoned, there must be a redemption.","And, I say, as there must, so there is: 'For with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.'","Mercy is the original, the cause, and the manager of our redemption.","Redemption is the manifestation, and the completing of that mercy.","If there had been no mercy, there had been no redemption.","Mercy had been defective as to us, or must have offered violence to the law and justice of God, and have saved us contrary to that word, 'In the day thou eatest thou shalt die,' and 'Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them.'","But now, redemption coming in by mercy, the sin is done away, and the sinner saved, in a way of righteousness.",Second.,"By law as well as grace; that is, in a way of justice as well as in a way of mercy.","Hence it saith we are 'justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus' (Rom 3:24).","Through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ, whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, and so to show the world the equity of his proceeding with sinners in the saving of their souls.","As if God should say to all those who stumble at the salvation of sinners by grace, Behold, I act according to law and justice.","For of grace I save them through a redemption, and therefore am faithful and just to my law, as well as free and liberal of my mercy.","Wherefore thus I declare I am righteous, faithful, and just in passing over or remitting of sin.","Nay, the matter so standeth now betwixt me and the sinful world, that I could not be just if I did not justify him that hath faith in the blood of Jesus, since by that blood my justice is appeased for all that this or that sinner has done against my law!","This is a way that God, nor any child of his, need be ashamed of before any that shall call in question the legality and justice of this procedure.","For why may not God be merciful, and why may not God be just?","And since he can be both merciful and just in the salvation of sinners, why may he not also save them from death and hell?","Christ is God's salvation, and to show that he is not ashamed of him, he hath presented him, and the way of redemption by him, before the face of all people (Luke 2:30-32).","Nor is the Son, who is become, with respect to the act of redemption, the author of eternal salvation, ashamed of this his doings.","'I gave my back to the smiters,' saith he, 'and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and smiting' (Isa 50:6).","This he speaks to show what were some of his sufferings when he engaged in the work of our redemption, and how heartily he did bear and go through them.","'For,' says he, 'the Lord God will help me,' that is, justify me in it, 'therefore shall I not be confounded, therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed' (v 7).","And if God, and his Son Jesus Christ, are neither of them ashamed to own this way of salvation, why should the sinners concerned thereabout be afraid thereupon to venture their soul?","I know, saith he, 'I shall not be ashamed'; I shall not, that is, when all things come to light, and everything shall appear above board; when the heart and soul of this undertaking of mine shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops, I know I shall not be ashamed.",It was also upon this account that Paul said he was not ashamed of the gospel (Rom 1).,For he knew that it was a declaration of the highest act of wisdom that ever God did spread before the face of the sons of men.,"And of what wisdom is the gospel a declaration but of that of forgiveness of sins by grace, through the redemption that is by the blood of Jesus Christ?","'In whom we have redemption through his blood,' even 'the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence' (Eph 1:7,8).","And as Paul speaketh here as a minister, so he speaketh after the same manner also as he is a believer, saying, 'I am not ashamed' of this gospel, 'for I know whom I have believed,' or trusted with my soul, 'and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day' (2 Tim 1:11,12).","Wherefore seeing that mercy is not presented to us alone, or singly, but as accompanying and concurring with redemption; it is manifest enough that mercy standeth not above, and consequently that it saveth none but in, by, and through a Redeemer.",He that believeth not in Christ shall be damned.,"But what needs that, if mercy could save the soul without the redemption that is by him?","If any say, Christ is the mercy of God to us.","True, if you count him a Redeemer, a worker out of a redemption for us by his death and blood upon the cross.","But otherwise he is none; I mean, if you make him a lawgiver, and a Saviour, only as he has set an example to us to get to heaven by doing commandments, or by treading in his steps.","Yea, though you say his commandment is that we believe in him: for, take the work of redemption by his blood from the curse, out of his hand, and then what concerning him is left from me to believe, but, as was said before, that he is a lawgiver, and as such, at best, but a pattern to us to get to heaven, as here?","And whoso counteth him as such, is so far off from counting of Christ the mercy of God to us, that they make him a contradictor of mercy, both in the fountain and all the streams of it.","For to propound life eternal to us, through the observation of laws, is to set before us that which contradicteth grace and mercy, let the work be what it will; nor will it help at all to say, that they that do the law of Christ, or that take him for their law and example, shall be sure of mercy to pass by their shortness of attaining to the perfection of what is set before them.","For all this might have been done, and not one drop of blood spilt for the redemption of man.","Besides, this makes Christ's death, as a Redeemer, as an act unadvisedly undertaken; for what need he have died, if his doctrine and example had been sufficient, through that which they call mercy, to have brought the soul to glory?","'If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain' (Gal 2:21).","I will add, put man's righteousness, God's mercy, and Christ's redemption, all together, and they will not save a man; though the last two alone will sufficiently do it: but this third is a piece when put to that, does, instead of mending, make the rent worse.","Besides, since man's righteousness cannot be joined in justification with God's mercy and Christ's redemption, but through a disbelief of the sufficiency of them, should it be admitted as a cause, though but the least cause thereof, what would follow, but to make that cursed sin of unbelief a good inventor, and a necessary worker in the manner of the justification of a sinner?","For, I say, unbelief is the cause of this hodge-podge in any; and the effects of it are showed in the 9th chapter of the epistle of Paul to the Romans, at the latter end thereof (vv 31-35).","And there are three things that follow upon that opinion that denieth the absolute necessity of the shedding of the blood of Christ for the redemption of man, that mercy might be let out to him.",1.,"It followeth from thence, that there is no such attribute as absolute justice in God; justice to stand to his word, and to vindicate every tittle of his law.","For let but this be granted, and the death of Christ must be brought in, or by justice the floodgate of mercy still be shut against sinful man; or that God must have mercy upon man, with the breach of his Word.",2.,"It also followeth from the premises, that Christ's death was of pleasure only, and not of necessity also; contrary to the Scripture, that makes his death the effect of both; of pleasure, to show how willing God the Father was that Christ should die for man: of necessity, to show that man could not be saved without it; of pleasure, to show how justice did deal with him for our sin; of necessity, to show that mercy could not be communicated to us without it (Isa 53:10; Matt 26:39; Acts 17:3).",3.,"There also followeth therefrom, that by the blood of Christ we have not redemption from law, and justice, as to the condemning part of both, but that rather this title is given to it for honour and glory, to dignify it; as the name of God is also given to him: for they that affirm the one, are bold to affirm the other.","For as by them is concluded, that there is no necessity why the blood of Christ should be counted the absolutely necessary price of our redemption from the curse of the law and severity of justice; so by them it is concluded, that it is not necessary to hold that Christ the Redeemer is naturally and co-eternally God, as the Father.","But 'let Israel hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.'",Third.,"Must there be redemption by blood added to mercy, if the soul be saved?",This shows us what an horrible thing the sin of man is.,"Sin, as to the nature of it, is little known in the world.",O!,"it sticks so fast to us, as not to be severed from us by all the mercy of God: do but exclude redemption by the blood of Christ.",I will say it over again.,"All the mercy of God cannot save a sinner, without respect to redemption from the curse of the law, by the death and blood of Christ.",'Without shedding of blood is no remission' (Heb 9:22).,"No remission, no pardon, or passing by of the least transgression, without it.",Tears!,Christ's tears will not do it.,Prayers!,Christ's prayers will not do it.,An holy life!,"the holy life that Christ lived, will not do it, as severed from his death and blood.","The word redemption, therefore, must be well understood, and close stuck to, and must not be allowed, as properly spoken, when we talk of deliverance from sin, the law, and God's curse, unless it be applied particularly to the death and blood of Christ (Eph 1:7).",We have redemption through his blood (Rev 1:5).,"'Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree' (Gal 3:13).",He has redeemed us to God by his blood.,"'For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood' (Rev 5:9).","This is the redemption that is joined with mercy, yea, that is the fruit thereof; and it is that without which sin cannot be removed out of the sight of God.","Moses, that was a better preacher of the law, and the sufficiency of the righteousness thereof, than any now can pretend to be, yet he full well declared by all his bloody sacrifices, that the blood and death of Jesus Christ is of absolute necessity for the redemption of the soul.","Besides, he tells us that the man that should flee to the city of refuge, from the avenger of blood, should not be at liberty from the law, unless he kept himself close in that city until the death of the high-priest.","Mark the words, 'Ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the' high 'priest' (Num 35:32).","Wherefore, Christian man, know thou thy sin in the nature of it and persuade thyself, that the removing of it from before the face of God is by no less means than the death and blood of Christ.","But it is a poor shift that the enemies of the truth are put to, when, to defend their errors, they are forced to diminish sin, and to enlarge the borders of their fig-leaf garments, and to deny or cast away, as much as in them lies, one of the attributes, the justice of God.","Indeed they will say they abhor to do thus, and all erroneous persons will put the best face they can upon their bad matters; but the natural consequences of things amount to it; nor can they, when men stick close to their sides, avoid the charge.",Fourth.,"Then here you see the reason of that free course that mercy hath among the sons of men, and why it doth, as has been showed before what it doth.",Why justice is content.,Blood hath answered the demand of justice.,The law hath nothing to object against his salvation that believeth in Jesus Christ.,"Blood has set the door open for us with boldness to go to God for mercy, and for God to come with his abundant grace to us.","We have 'boldness, brethren, to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the vail, that is to say, his flesh' (Heb 10:19,20).","This is the way that Moses desired to find, when God so largely spake to him of his mercy.","'Thou hast said,' says Moses to God, 'I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.","Now, therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way that I may know thee,' &c. (Exo 33:12,13).",What if it should be applied thus?,"thou now talkest of mercy, but in thy words to us from the Mount, thou spakest fire and justice; and since thou hast delivered us to holy a law, and are resolved that the least tittle thereof shall by no means fall to the ground; by what means is it that mercy should come unto us?","Well, saith God, I will show thee my way, I will put thee in a clift of the rock, which was a figure of Christ, for Christ says, 'I am the way' (Exo 34; John 14:6).","This done, he proclaimed his name, and showed him how he could be gracious, and gave him the sign of his being merciful, a promise that his presence should go with him.","The breaking then of the body of Jesus was, the renting of the vail, that out of which came blood, that the way to God might be living; and not death, or sword, or flame, to the poor children of men.","Out hence therefore bubbleth continually the tender mercy, the great mercy, the rich mercy, the abundant mercy, the multiplying mercy, and every other mercy of God to us for our present and everlasting good.","Not that God was sparing of his mercy, and would not part with it unless paid for it; for this way of redemption by blood was his contrivance, the fruit of his wisdom (Eph 1:8).","So then, God was big with mercy for a sinful world; but to be continually extending of mercy, since sin and justice, because of the sanction of the law, lay in the way as a turning flaming sword, there did lie the work (Gen 3:24); so it was concluded, that mercy might, in a way of justice, be let out to sinners; Christ, the Son of God, should die for the sin of man.","By which means the outcries of the law and justice against us for our sins did cease, and mercy flowed from heaven like the waters of Noah, until it became a sea (Micah 7:18,19).","By redemption by blood, therefore, is this great mystery--That a just God can save that man that has broken that law, that God has said he will inflict the penalty for the breach thereof upon, and do his justice no wrong--expounded; not by a relaxation of the punishment, as the doltish wisdom of this world imagines; but by an inflicting of the exactest justice upon that nature that has offended.","If the question be asked, How a just God can save that man from death, that by sin has put himself under the sentence of it?","any fool can answer, 'By a pardon.'","And if it be asked, But what will become of the threatening wherewith he threatened the offender?","He that knows no mysteries can say, Why, man must repent of his sin, and God of his threatening.","But if it be asked, How God can execute his threatening to the utmost, and yet deliver the sinner by his mercy from it; the sinner that has deserved it, and yet be just to his law, faithful to his law, and one that will stand by every tittle of his law?","this, to expound, is to high for a fool; therefore these men are for despising of mysteries, and for counting of mysteries in the gospel, follies.","But this key of heaven is no where but in the Word of the Spirit; it is not seen in the law, nor in the reason or righteousness of the world.","To punish 'the just for the unjust,' and to make him 'to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him,' seems unreasonable; so cross to the wisdom of man are the wards of this lock (1 Peter 3:18; 2 Cor 5:21).","Wherefore usually, when they come at this doctrine, they belch out their frumps, their taunts, their scoffs, and their scorns against it; and in opposition thereto, comment, exalt, cry up, and set on high, Socinianism, Mahometanism, man's ragged righteousness, or anything.",But we will pass these things.,Fifth.,"The knowledge of redemption, and the faith of redemption, is the only means of settling, composing, and upholding the soul of the thoroughly awakened, in the hope of enjoying a portion in mercy for ever.","What senseless, secure, besotted, and deluded men, conclude of themselves, and of the means of future happiness, is one thing; and what the thoroughly awakened soul concludes upon, is another.","And I say, one thoroughly awakened about the nature of God, the nature of sin, and the worth of the soul, will find but little ease of mind, notwithstanding notions of mercy, until he comes and sees that he must be saved by mercy and justice both; and that to be sure he shall never do, until he is taught that by the blood of Christ the law is, as to the curse that is in it against the sinner, taken out of the way (Col 2).","These things, sin and justice, are too great to be played with by him that shall see them in the light of the law, and that shall feel them in their terror upon a trembling conscience.","But when the soul shall see that a propitiation is made to justice by blood, then, and not till then, it sees sin taken away: and when it sees, by this means, sin taken away, then it can behold to hope in the mercy of God.","Yea, and it will be as hard to wring off him that is settled here, from this belief to another, as it would be to persuade him that stands upon sound ground to venture his life upon a shaking bottomless quag.",O!,It is a pleasant thing for the wounded conscience to taste the sweetness of redeeming blood!,(John 6:51-56).,This is like the best wine that goes down sweetly; this carries with the last of it the very tang[25] of eternal life!,(Heb 9:14).,"And know that dead works, or works of death, will abide in the conscience, notwithstanding all talk and notions of mercy, until that be purged with blood applied thereto, by the Spirit and faith.","This is one of the three that abide to witness on earth, that 'God hath given us eternal life, and that this life is in his Son'; because he died for us, and rose again (1 John 5:8-11).","This, therefore, is that that will establish a man with that peace that shall not be shaken, because by this such an one seeth the justice of God is quieted.",For peace is made by the blood of the cross; peace with God for sinners (Col 1:20).,"Yea, God himself, by the blood of the cross, has made it, that by him, Christ, he might reconcile to himself all things, whether they be things on earth, or things in heaven.","Nor will a man that is truly spiritually wise, rest till he comes where God towards man doth rest; but that can be only there, where such means are offered for the taking away of sin, that are of a sweet-smelling savour to God.","Now this is the offering that Christ offered, to wit, himself; for Christ loved us, and hath given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God, for a sweet-smelling savour (Eph 5:2).","Therefore it is by it, the body of his flesh, through death, that we are presented holy, unblameable, and unreproveable in his sight (Col 1:21).","Wherefore it must be true which was said before, to wit, That the knowledge of redemption, and the faith of redemption, is the only means of settling, composing, and upholding of the soul of the thoroughly awakened, in the hope of enjoying a portion in mercy for ever.","He that hath the Son of God, hath the Father, hath life; because with him is the means of peace with the Father, and so of eternal life (1 John 2:23).","But then, to have the Son, is to believe on him, and on the Father through him (1 John 5:10-12).","On him, that he is the Saviour by his blood; and on the Father through him, as believing that he, for his Son's sufferings, is pacified with us, and of his grace hath forgiven us, through him, all trespasses (2 John 9; Eph 4:32).",Sixth.,The knowledge and faith of this redemption fortifieth the Christian against temptations.,"We that do believe, know what it is to be assaulted by the devil, and to have knotty objections cast into our minds by him.","We also know what advantage the vile sin of unbelief will get upon us, if our knowledge and faith in this redemption be in the least, below the common faith of saints, defective.","If we talk of mercy, he can talk of justice; if we talk of grace, he can talk of the law.","And all his words, when God will suffer it, we shall find as sharp, and subject to stick in our minds, as bearded arrows are to stick in flesh.","Besides, he can and doth, and that often, work in our fancies and imaginations such apprehensions of God, that he shall seem to be to us one that cannot abide us, one that hates us, and that lieth in wait to destroy us.","And now, if any body speaks to us of mercy, we think we might hope in that, had we nothing to trouble us but the guilt of actual sins.","But we see our nature as full of the filth of sin, as the egg is of meat, or the toad of poison: which filth vilely recoileth against the commandments, flieth in the face of God, and continueth all his judgments.","[26] This is felt, this is seen by the sinner, who cannot help it; nor can he be brought to that consideration as to say, 'It is no more I' (Rom 7).","Now, what shall this man do?",Shall he look to the commandment?,There is death?,Shall he look to God?,There is justice!,Shall he look to himself?,There is sin out of measure!,"Let him look, then, to one as dying, to the 'lamb as it had been slain,' and there let him see himself by this Lamb, as cursed, and a dying of a cursed death for this sin that doth so fright and so distress the soul (Rev 5:6).","Then let him turn again, and behold this Lamb alive and well, and highly exalted by this God, that but just before laid the curse of the law upon him; but let him be sure to reckon that he has died for his sins by the person of Christ, and it will follow that this man is now acquitted, because Christ is still alive.",Say I these things as a man?,Saith not the gospel the very same?,1.,As to Christ's dying for us; as also that we are dead to the law by the body of Christ (Rom 6:6; 7).,2.,"And that we should so reckon as to this matter, because that God has transferred our sin from us to him.",1.,"Did not Christ die for us; and dying for us, are we not become dead to the law by the death of his body?","or will the law slay both him and us, and that for the same transgression?","(Rom 7:1,2).","If this be concluded in the affirmative, what follows but that Christ, though he undertook, came short in doing for us?","But he was raised up from the dead, and believing marrieth us to him as risen, and that stops the mouth of all.","I am crucified with Christ, our old man was crucified with him, and we are become dead to the law by the body of Christ (Rom 5:3,4).",What then?,2.,"Why, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ.","Ay, but says the soul, 'How can I reckon thus, when sin is yet strong in me?'",Answ.,"Read the words again, He saith not, Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, in yourselves; but dead unto it through Jesus Christ.","Not alive unto God in yourselves, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ.",For Christ in his death and resurrection representeth me.,"As I died by him, I arose again by him, and live through the faith of the gospel in the presence of God by him.","This must in the first place be allowed and believed, or no true peace can come near the soul, nor the soul be prepared to assoil the assaults of the adversary.","Let therefore thy faith, if thou wouldst be a warrior, O thou faint-hearted Christian, be well instructed in this!",Then will thy faith do thee a twofold kindness.,1.,It will conform thee to the death and resurrection of Christ.,"And, 2.","It will give thee advantage, when thou seest sin strong in thyself, yet to conclude that by Christ thou art dead thereto, and by him alive therefrom.",Nor can there but two objections be made against this.,"The first is to question whether any are said to die and rise, by the death and resurrection of Christ?",or if it so may be said; yet whether thou art one of them?,To the first the scripture is full.,"To the second, thy faith must be strong: for let go faith here, and all falls flat to the ground, I mean as to comfort and consolation.","Christ died for us, or in our stead; therefore, by the Word of God, I am allowed so to reckon.","Christ rose and revived, though he died for me; therefore I rose and revived by Christ: unless any does hold, that though he died in a common, yet he arose as considered but in a single capacity.","Now, then, if Satan comes and tells me of my sins, I answer, 'Christ has taken them upon himself.'","If he comes and tells me of the death that is due to me for sin, by the curse of the holy law, I answer, I have already undergone that by Christ.","If he asks me, How I know that the law will not lay hold of me also?","I answer, Because Christ is risen from the dead.","If he asks me, By what authority I take upon me thus to reason?","I tell him, By the authority and allowance of the holy and most blessed gospel, which saith, He 'was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification' (Rom 4).","And to encourage thee thus to believe, and thus to hold, when thou art in an hour of temptation, this is the way to see mercy stand and smile upon thee; for mercy will smile upon him that shall thus believe (2 Cor 3:16-18).",This is the way to put faith and hope both to work against the devil; and to do this is very pleasing to God.,This the way to make that hell-bound retreat and leave off to assault (James 4:7; 1 Peter 5:9).,"And this is the way to find an answer to many scriptures, with which else thou wilt not know what to do, as with many of the types and shadows; yea, and with the moral law itself.","Besides, thus believing setteth thy soul against the fear of death, and judgment to come; for if Christ be raised from the dead who died for our sins; and if Christ who died for our sins is entered into glory: I say again, if Christ who died for our sins has purchased us to himself, and is purposed that the fruit of this his purchase shall be, that we may behold his face in glory; then, cast off slavish fear of death and judgment: for Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him!",Seventh.,The knowledge and faith of this redemption prepareth man to a holy life.,"By a holy life, I mean a life according to the moral law, flowing from a spirit of thankfulness to God for giving of his Son to be my Redeemer.","This I call a holy life, because it is according to the rule of holiness, the law, and this I call a holy life, because it floweth from such a principle as giveth to God the heart, and life, for the gift bestowed on us.","What pretences soever there are to holiness, if it floweth not from thankfulness for mercy received, it floweth from a wrong principle, and so cannot be good.","Hence, men were required of old, to serve the Lord with joyfulness, 'for the abundance of all things'; and threatened, if they did not, that 'they should serve their enemies in hunger and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in the want of all things' (Deut 28:47,48).","But then, though there are many mercies that lay an obligation upon men to be holy, yet he that shall want the obligation that is begotten by the faith of redeeming mercy, wanteth the main principle of true holiness: nor will any other be found sufficiently to sanctify the heart to the causing of it to produce such a life; nor can such holiness be accepted, because it comes not forth in the name of Christ.","That that obliged David was forgiving and redeeming mercy; and that that obliged Paul was the love that Christ showed to him, in dying for his sins, and in rising from the dead (Psa 103:1-5; 2 Cor 5:14,15).","Paul also beseecheth the Romans, by the redeeming, justifying, preserving, and electing mercy of God, that they present their body 'a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God; which is,' saith he, 'your reasonable service' (Rom 12:1).",For we must be holy and without blame before him in love (Eph 4:1).,"Hence, all along, they that are exhorted to holiness in the New Testament, are exhorted to it upon the supposition of the benefit of redemption which they have received by Jesus Christ.",'Walk in love as Christ also hath loved us' (Eph 5:2).,"'If there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the same love,' &c. (Phil 2:1,2).","'If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.","Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.","For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.","When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.","Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth,' &c. (Col 3:1-5).","'Wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil-speakings, as new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby, if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious' (1 Peter 2:1-3).","I will conclude this with that of Peter, to those to whom he wrote concerning this very thing.","Be 'obedient children,' saith he, 'not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance; but as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation: because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy, And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.","Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot' (1 Peter 1:14-19).","From all which it appears, that mercy by Christ, or from the benefit of redemption by the precious blood of Christ, I say, from the faith of that, flows that which is holiness indeed.","And I believe that those very men that are pleased to taunt at this kind of inference, would condemn a man was he laid under these obligations concerning things of this life, and yet did carry it as one not touched thereby.","We will make an instance: Suppose a Socinian should, through his contracting a great debt, be forced to rot in prison, unless redeemed by silver and gold: and suppose a man, unto whom this Socinian was an enemy, should lay down the whole debt to the creditor, that this Socinian might be at liberty, might trade, and live comfortably in this world; and if, after this, this Socinian should taunt at them that should tell him he is engaged to this redeemer, ought to love and respect this redeemer; what would they say but that this Socinian that was a debtor is an inconsiderate and stupefied rascal?","Why, this is the case; Paul was a debtor to the law and justice of God; Jesus Christ his Son, that Paul might not perish for ever, paid for him a price of redemption, to wit, his most precious blood.",But what!,"Shall Paul now, though redeemed from perpetual imprisonment in hell, be as one that never was beholden to Jesus Christ; or if others say he was, taunt at them for their so saying?","No, he scorns it.","Though the love of Christ, in dying to pay a price of redemption, will not engage a Socinian, yet it will engage a true Christian to think and believe that he ought to live to Jesus, that died for him and rose again.","I know it will be objected that the Satisfactionists, as the quaking Penn is pleased to call them, show but little of this to the world; for their pride, covetousness, false dealing, and the like, since they profess as I have said, shows them as little concerned to the full as to the Socinian under consideration.","I answer, it must be that the name of Christ should be scandalized through some that profess him; and they must answer it at the tribunal of the great Judge; yet what I have said stands fast as a rock that cannot be moved.",Eighth.,The knowledge and faith of redemption is a very great encouragement to prayer.,"It is great encouragement for the poor to go even to a prince for what he wanteth, when he considereth that what he goeth to him for is the price of redemption.","All things that we want, we must ask the Father for, in the name of Christ: we must ask it of him for the sake of his redeeming blood, for the sake of the merit of his passion (John 15:16).","Thus David means, when he says, 'For thy name's sake' do it (Psa 25:11); and Daniel when he saith here, 'For the Lord's sake' (9:17).",For Jesus Christ is God's great name; and to do for his sake is to do for what worthiness is in him.,Unworthiness!,The consideration of unworthiness is a great stumbling-block to the tempted when he goes to seek the Lord.,"But now, remembering the worthiness of Christ, and that he is now on the right hand of God, on purpose to plead that on the behalf of the petitioner, this is great encouragement.","The Jews, by God's ordinance, when they went morning and evening by their priest to speak with God, were to offer a lamb for a burnt-offering, and it must be thus continually (Exo 29:38-46).","Now this lamb was a figure of the sacrificing of the body of Christ which was to be offered for them in time to come; and, in that it was to be continually, morning and evening, so repeated, what doth it signify, but that we should remember to go, when we went to God, in the name and faith of the merits of Jesus Christ for what we stood in need of?","This will support, and this will encourage, for now we see that the thing desired--it being according to his will--is obtained for us by the sacrificing of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all.","When Israel begged of Samuel that he would not cease to cry to the Lord their God for them, it is said he took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt-offering wholly unto the Lord; and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel, and the Lord heard him (1 Sam 7:8,9).","But why did he take a sucking lamb, and why did he offer it, and that wholly unto the Lord, as he cried, but to show to Israel that he was not heard for his own, or for his righteousness sake, but for the sake of Christ, whose merits were prefigured by Samuel's burning of the lamb?","Also when David spake for himself to Saul, he put himself upon this, 'If,' saith he, 'the Lord hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering, a smell, a sweet-smelling sacrifice; a figure of the satisfactoriness of the sufferings of Jesus Christ' (1 Sam 26:19).","What is the meaning of all these passages, if not to show that when we go to pray to God, we should turn away our face from every thing of ours, and look to God, only by the price of redemption paid for us by Jesus Christ, and plead that alone with him as the great prevailing argument, and that by and for the sake of which he giveth pardon and grace to help in time of need?","Wherefore, wouldst thou be a praying man, a man that would pray and prevail?","why, pray to God in the faith of the merits of Christ, AND SPEED.",[27] Ninth.,"For this is the very cause why this is added in the text, to wit, the plenteousness of redemption, it is, I say, that men should hope to partake by it, of the goodness and mercy of God.","'Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.'","Mercy and redemption, mercy through a Redeemer, therefore 'let Israel hope'!","It must also be noted, that this word redemption is, as it were, the explicatory part of the text, for the helping of Israel to hope.","As who should say, as there is with God mercy, so there is with him a way to his mercy, and that way is redemption, or a price paid for your sins; and that you should not be discouraged through the greatness of your sins, I tell you there is with God plenty of this redemption, or a price paid to the full; to an over and above.","It also is as if he had said, Forget not this, for this is the key of all the rest, and the great support to the saints in prayer, or while they wait upon God in any of his appointments to encourage them to hope.",Tenth.,"And lastly, This also should teach the saints, when they sin or praise the Lord, they should not sing of mercy only, but of mercy and judgment too; 'I will sing of mercy and judgment; unto thee, O Lord, will I sing' (Psa 101:1).","Of mercy and judgment, or justice in the manifestation of it, as smiling upon our forgiveness.","When Hannah sang of, and rejoiced in God's salvation, she sang aloud of holiness, saying, 'There is none holy as the Lord' (1 Sam 2:1,2).","Holy in keeping his word, though it cost the blood of his Son.","This also is that that is called a helping of his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy, and the performing of the mercy promised; even the oath that he sware to our father Abraham, that he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies--by a Redeemer--might serve him without fear, &c. (Luke 1:49,54).","When you praise, therefore, remember Christ and his blood, and how justice and judgment took hold on him, that they might not take hold on thee; yea, how they by taking hold on him, left a way to thee to escape.","Isaac should have been sacrificed, had not the Lord provided a ram; and thou thyself shouldest have been damned, had not the Lord provided a lamb (Gen 22; Rev 5).","Hence Christ is called the 'Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world,' that taketh them away by the sacrifice of himself.","Sing therefore in your praises unto God, and to the Lamb!",[THE APPLICATION OR USE OF THE WHOLE.],I would come now to speak one short word of use to the whole.,"And, First.","This still shows more and more, what a sad state God's people have brought themselves into by sin.","I told you before that the revelation of so much mercy as is presented unto us by the first part of the text, sufficiently declared our state to be miserable by sin.","But what shall we say, when there must be added to that the heart blood of the Son of God, and all to make our salvation complete?","For albeit mercy is essential to our salvation, and that without which there can be no salvation; yet it is the blood that maketh the atonement for the soul, THAT propitiates, and so makes capable of enjoying of it.","It was mercy and love, as I said afore, that sent one to shed his blood for us; and it is the blood of him that was sent, that puts us into the enjoyment of mercy.",O!,"I have thought sometimes, what bloody creatures hath sin made us!","[28] The beasts of the field must be slain by thousands before Christ came, to signify to us we should have a Saviour; and after that, he must come himself, and die a worse death than died those beasts, before the work of saving could be finished.","O redemption, redemption by blood, is the heart-endearing consideration!","This is that which will make the water stand in our eyes, that will break a heart of flint, and that will make one do as they do, that are 'in bitterness for their first-born' (Zech 12:10).","Sinner, wouldst thou have mercy?",wouldst thou be saved?,"Go thou then to the blood of the cross, as set forth in the word of the truth of the gospel, and there thou shalt find that mercy that thou hast need of first; for there is a mercy that may be called a FIRST mercy, and that is the mercy that gives admittance into, and an interest in all the rest.","Now the mercy that doth this, is that which reconcileth us to God; but that other things cannot do, if we stand off from the blood of the cross.","Wherefore we are said to be reconciled to God, by the death of his Son.","'For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life' (Rom 5:10).","According to that other saying, 'He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?'",(8:32).,"In both these places the Son of God, and our Redeemer, is set forth to us in the first place, as the only one that reconcileth to God the sinner by the blood of his cross; wherefore to this Christ, as crucified, the sinner must come first; because nothing else can reconcile to God; and if thou be not reconciled to God, what art thou but an enemy to him, partake of what mercy thou canst?",(Col 1:20).,"Go to him, did I say?","receive him into the arms of thy faith; hold him fast, for he is a Saviour; yea, carry him as set forth by the gospel, dying for thee, and pray God for his sake to bestow upon thee all those mercies that will compass thee about as with a shield, and follow thee all thy days, till thou enterest in at the doors of eternity; and this is the way to speed!","For he that hath the Son hath life, in the beginning of it; and he that holds fast the Son, shall have life in the consummation of it.","I do the oftener touch upon this matter, because this Christ is the door, in at which whosoever entereth shall be saved; but he that climbs up any other way, shall be judged as a thief and a robber (John 10:1).","[29] But, Second.","Is Christ, as crucified, the way and door to all spiritual and eternal mercy?","And doth God come to the sinner, and the sinner again go to God in a saving way by him, and by him only?","And is there no other way to the Father but by his blood, and through the veil, that is to say, his flesh?","(Heb 10:19,20).","Then this shows the danger, upon what pretence soever, of casting off the daily sacrifice, and setting up in its place the abomination that maketh desolate.","I mean, of casting away a crucified Christ, and the setting up the vanity of moral obedience as the more substantial and most acceptable thing with God.","I call not a crucified Christ the daily sacrifice, as if I thought he often suffered for sin, since the foundation of the world; but because the virtue of that one offering is that, and only that, by the which we daily draw nigh unto God; and because the virtuousness of that one sacrifice will for ever abide beneficial to them that come to God, to the world's end by him.","But I say, into what a miserable plight have such people put themselves, that have cast off coming to God by Christ, as he is the propitiation for their sins, and that seek to come another way?","Such are lapsed again to Gentilism, to Paganism, to Heathenism; nor will it help at all to say they rely on the mercy and goodness of God, for there is no such thing as spiritual and eternal mercy can come from God to him, that comes not to him by Christ.","The Turks, if I be not mistaken, have this for the beginning of every chapter of their Alcoran, 'The Lord, God, gracious and merciful,'[30] yet are counted unbelievers, and are verily so, for they have not received the faith of Christ.","The Lord God, gracious and merciful, will not save them, no not by grace and mercy, unless repenting of their presuming upon mercy, without a bloody sacrifice, they come to him by his Son (Acts 4:12).","Men therefore that have laid aside the necessity of reconciliation to God by the precious blood of Christ, are in a damned state; nor will it help at all to say they do indeed believe in him.","I am not so void of reason as to think that they that have cast away Christ, as he is a propitiatory sacrifice with God for sin, should also cast away his name out of their mouth; no, his name is too honorable, and the profession of it too glorious for them to do such a thing.","But retaining his name, and the notion of him as a Saviour, they yet cast him off, and that in those very things wherein the essential part of his sacrifice, the merit of it, and his everlasting priesthood, consists; and in this lies the mystery of their iniquity.","They will have him to be a Saviour, but it must not be by fulfilling of the law for us; but it must not be by the putting of his glorious righteousness, that which he performed by subjecting himself to the law, on our behalf, upon us; but it must not be by washing of us from our sins in his own blood; but it must be by his kingly and prophetical offices.","When, as for his kingly and prophetical offices, he puts those people under the government of them that he has afore made to stand justified before God, from the curse of the law by his priesthood.","Nor dare they altogether deny that Christ doth save his people as a priest, but then their art is to confound these offices, by pleading that they are in effect but one and the self-same thing; and then with a noise of morality and government, they jostle the merit of his blood, and the perfection of his justifying righteousness, out of doors; and so retaining the name of Christ in their mouths, they cast those things of Christ, that they like not, under feet; which things, they who have not the faith of, must not, cannot see the kingdom of God.","The term of mercy is but a general sound, and is as an arrow shot at rovers, unless the blood and death of the Son of God be set before us, as the mark or mean by which our spirits are to be directed to it.","What profit shall a man have, and what shelter or succour shall he find, in hearing of the most exact relation of the strength of the most impregnable castle in the world, unless he knows the door, and entereth in by that, into that place of strength, in the time when the enemy shall pursue him?","Why, this is the case: We hear a noise of mercy, and of being at peace with God; what a good God, God is, and what a blessed thing it is to be a child of God; how many privileges the children of God have, and what will be their exaltation and glory in the next world!","And all the while they that tell us these things conceal from us the way thereto, which is Christ, not in the naming of him, but in the right administration of his gospel to us.","Christ, and faith in him as a Saviour, not in the name only, but in the true sense thereof, is the mark, as I have said, from which if any swerve, they err from the saving way, and so come nothing near that mercy that can save them.","Hence Christ is called a standard, an ensign (Isa 5:26).","'And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek, and his rest shall be glorious' (Isa 11:10).","And again, 'Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles; and set up my standard to the people' (49:22).","'Go through, go through the gates, prepare ye the way of the people,--gather out the stones, lift up a standard for the people.","Behold the Lord hath proclaimed to the end of the world; say ye to the daughter of Zion, behold thy salvation cometh.","Behold his reward is with him, and his work before him' (62:10,11).","Hence again he is called the captain, the chieftain, of our salvation, and him without whom there neither is nor can be any.","But now the men of this confederacy, rather than they will submit themselves to the righteousness of God, will lay odiums and scandals upon them that preach they should (Rom 10:2,4).","Not forsooth, if you will believe them, but that they are highly for the righteousness of God, let it be that which they count so; but then to be sure it shall never be the personal performances of Christ, by which they that believe in him are justified from all things; but that which they call 'first principles,' 'dictates of human nature,' 'obedience to a moral precept,' followed and done as they have Christ for an example; not understanding that Christ, in his own doings, is the end of all these things to every one that believeth.","But if it be urged that Gentiles and Pagans are possessed with those very principles, only they have not got the art, as our men have, to cover them with the name of Christ and principles of Christianity, then they fall to commending the heathens and their philosophers, and the natural motives and principles by which they were actuated; preferring of them much before what by others are called the graces of the Spirit, and principles upon what the doctrine of the free grace and mercy of God by Christ are grounded.","But, as I said, all the good that such preachers can do as to the next world, is, to draw the people away from their ensign and their standard, and so lead them among the Gentiles and infidels, to seek by their rules the way to this unspeakable mercy of God.","Wherefore their state being thus deplorable, and their spirits thus incorrigible, they must be pitied, and left, and fled from, if we would live.",Third.,"Is Christ Jesus the redemption; and, as such, the very door and inlet into all God's mercies?","Christian man, look well to thyself, that thou goest no whither, and dost nothing, I mean in any part of religious worship, &c., but as thou art in him (2 Cor 12:18,19).","[31] Walk in him, speak in him, grow in him, for he is THE ALL (Col 2:6,7).","And though others regard not to 'hold the head, from which all the body by joints and bands have nourishment ministered,' yet have thou a care!",(Eph 4:15; Col 2:19).,"This is he that is thy life, and the length of thy days, and without whom no true happiness can be had.","Many there be that count this but a low thing; they desire to soar aloft, to fly into new notions, and to be broaching of new opinions, not counting themselves happy, except they can throw some new-found fangle, to be applauded for, among their novel-hearers.","But fly thou to Christ for life; and that thou mayest so do, remember well thy sins, and the judgment and wrath of God; and know also that he is merciful, but at mercy none can come, but through the cursed death Christ underwent.","And although some of the wanton professors of our age may blame thee for poring so much upon thy sins, and the pollution of thy nature, yet know that there is an advantage in it.","There be some alive in the world, who, though they count the nature and commission of sin the very evil of evils, yet can say that the remembrance of how vile they are, and of what evils they have committed, has been to them a soul-humbling, a Christ-advancing, and a creature-emptying consideration.","Though sin made death bitter to Christ, yet sin makes Christ sweet to his.","And though none should sin, that grace might abound, yet where sin has abounded, grace doth much more abound, not only as an act of God, but also in the eye of faith.","A sight of the filth, and a sense of the guilt of sin, makes a pardon to such a soul more than empty notion; and makes the mean through which the pardon comes more to be desired than is either life or limb.","This is it that makes the sensible soul prize the Lord Jesus, while the self-justiciary[32] laugheth him to scorn.","This is it which makes the awakened sinner cast away his own righteousness, while the self-conceited one makes it his advocate with the Father.","Some, indeed, count their own doings the only darling of their soul, while others cast it to the dogs.","And why should a man cumber himself with what is his, when the good of all that is in Christ is laid, and to be laid out for him?","Not that a believer casts off to do good, for he knows that what good thing is done in faith and love, is acceptable to God, and profitable to his neighbour.","But this is it, he setteth not his good deed against the judgment of God; he cometh not in his own good.","When he comes to God for forgiveness of sins, then he sees nothing, knows nothing, mentions nothing as righteousness, but that which Christ wrought out in the days of his flesh, and that only.",But how then is what he doth accepted of God?,"Verily as the duty of a son, and as the work of one that is justified.","We must therefore conclude that there is acceptation, and acceptation: acceptation of the person, and acceptation of his performance.","Acceptation of the person may be considered with respect to justification from the curse, and so acceptation there can be none, but through the one offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.","Also the acceptation of a duty done by such a person is, by virtue of the self-same offering, the person being considered as standing just through Christ before God.","And the reason why a justified person must have his duties accepted the same way, as is his person, is because justifying righteousness sets not the person free from sin, save only in the sight of God and conscience; he remaineth still infirm in himself, and standeth still in need of the fresh and continual application of the merits of the Lord Jesus, which also the soul receiveth by virtue of Christ's intercession.","I speak now of acceptation with reference to the justice of the law, and the judgment of God upon person or work, according to the self-same law.","For so they both must be accepted through the self-same Mediator, or they cannot be accepted at all.","Nor is it a thing to be wondered at, that a man should stand just in the sight of God, when polluted and defiled in his own sight.","He stands just before God in the justice of his Son, upon whom God looks, and for whose sake he accepts him.","May not a scabbed, mangy man, a man all over-run with blains and blotches, be yet made beautiful to the view of a beholder, through the silken, silver, golden garment that may be put upon him, and may cover all his flesh?","Why, the righteousness of Christ is not only unto but upon all them that believe (Rom 3:22).","And whoso considers the parable of the wretched infant, shall find, that before it was washed with water it was wrapped up or covered, as it was found, in its blood, in and with the skirt of his garment that found it in its filth.","And then he washed it with water, and then he sanctified it by the anointing oil of the Spirit of God (Eze 16:8,9).","I speak thus to thee, Christian reader, partly because in the faith of these things is thy life; and because I would yet enforce the exhortation upon thee with the reason and the amplification thereof, to wit, to put thee upon trusting in the Lord through the encouragement that thou hast in redeeming mercy so to do.","Some may say, Will God see that which is not?",and will he judge a man just that is a sinner?,"But I will answer, The man that had the rainbow about his head, was to look on, or be looked upon, while he shone like a jasper and a sardix-stone (Rev 4:3).",The blood of the paschal lamb was to be looked upon by him that came to destroy the land of Egypt in their firstborn (Exo 12:13).,"I add, The rainbow that God gave to Noah for a token that he would no more destroy the earth with the waters of the flood, was to be looked upon, that God might remember to show mercy to his people (Gen 9:8-17).","Now all these meet in the man Christ Jesus, who is the only one, for the sake of whom the sinner that believeth in him stands acquitted in the sight of God.","His is the blood, he is the prince, that is more than the token of the covenant: nor do all the colours in the rainbow appear so beautiful in the eyes of man, as does the garment of Christ; which is from his loins, even upward, and from his loins, even downward, in the eyes of the God of heaven (Eze 1:27,28).",And wilt thou say these are things that are not?,"Also, he can legally judge a man just, that is a sinner.","Do but admit of a diverse consideration, and God will so consider of that sinner which he justifieth, in despite of all the teeth in thy proud mouth!",'He justifieth the ungodly' (Rom 4:5).,"Not that were, but that are such now, in the judgment and verdict of the law, might deal with them in their own persons as men (Rom 5:5-10).","He will then consider them in his Son; in, and under the skirt of his Son.","He will consider them as washed in the blood of his Son, and will also consider 'that in him is no sin,' and so he will deal with them.","'We know that he was manifested to take away our sins, and in him is no sin' (1 John 3:5).","What though I have broke a thousand pound in my creditor's debt--yet if another will discharge the whole freely, what has the law to do with me as to that?","Or what if I cannot but live upon the spend all my days, yet if my friend will always supply my need, and, through his bounty, keep me from writ, bailiff, or jail, is it not well for me?","Yea, what if what I can get shall be laid up for me for hereafter, and that my friend, so long as there is death or danger in the way, will himself secure me, and bear my charges to the world's end; may I not accept thereof, and be thankful?",Blessed be God for Jesus Christ!,I believe he is more than all this to me.,"'In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory' (Isa 45:25).",I know similitudes will not hold in all things; but we that believe are set free from the curse of the law by another man's obedience.,For 'by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous' (Rom 5:19).,"Let then the believer, as was said, study and pray, and read God's Word continually, for the sake of the glory of this truth, that it may be made more his own, and that his conscience may be more and more settled in the power and glory thereof.",[33] Fourth.,"As the Christian should most labour to get into the power and glory of this doctrine, so let him see that he holds it fast.","This doctrine is foreign to flesh and blood; it is not earthly, but from heaven (Matt 16:17).","It is with many that begin with this doctrine, as it is with boys that go to the Latin school; they learn till they have learned the grounds of their grammar, and then go home and forget all.","How have many, that as to the grounds of Christian religion, one would think, had been well taught, yet not taking such heed thereto as they should, they have let slip all, and their hearts have been filled with the world again, or else have drunk in some opinion that has been diametrically opposite to what they professed of the truth before (Heb 2:1-4).",Wherefore hast thou anything of the truth of Christ in thy heart?,"'Hold that fast, that no man take thy crown' (Rev 3:11).","Yea 'grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ' (2 Peter 3:18).","He that will retain and hold fast the doctrine of redemption, and so by that have, through faith, an inlet into all the abounding mercy of God, must not deal in God's matters with a slack hand.","It is not enough for them that would do so, to be content with sermons, family duties, and other public assemblies for worship, but there must be a continual exercise of the mind about these matters, and a labour of the soul to retain them in their glory and sweetness; else they will, first as to their excellency, then as to the very notion of them, slip from the heart and be gone (Heb 2:1-3).","Not that there is treachery or deceit therein, but the deceit lies in the heart about them.","He that will keep water in a sieve, must use more than ordinary diligence.","Our heart is the leaking vessel; and 'therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.'","That this doctrine may remain with us, we must also mortify our carnal reason: for that makes head against the truth thereof, and what can foolishness do else?","And the wisdom of this world, which is carnal reason in its improvements, is foolishness with God (1 Cor 1:20-25).","It is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be.","It judges this doctrine that we have been speaking of, foolishness; wherefore it must be avoided, opposed and mortified, and the word of faith the more carefully submitted to.","'Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding' (Rom 3:5).","See here, that trusting in the Lord, and leaning to our own understanding, are opposites; wherefore they must either be reconciled, or one quite adhered unto, in a way of mortification of the other.","Now, it is safest in this matter to keep a continual guard upon our carnal powers; and to give up ourselves to the conduct of our God, and in all our ways acknowledge him, that he, not ourselves, may direct our paths (v 6).","It is a great thing for a man, when the Word and his reason clashes, then to adhere to the Word, and let his reason fall to the ground.",And this indeed is Christianity in the practical part thereof.,"The Spirit of Christ in the Word is to be hearkened unto, above all things (2 Cor 10:3-5).","There must also be a continual war maintained upon all the lusts of the flesh, that they may not draw away the heart from the study and delight, the love and faith, of the things that are hid in Christ (Isa 28:9).","This, I say, must be done, else the heart cannot be at liberty to wait upon the Lord without distraction, for the further communications of himself in his Son, according to his blessed gospel to us.","Many Christians are lean in their faith and too barren in their lives, and all for want of being diligent here.","Wherefore having faith in this blessed Lord Jesus Christ, as has been afore discoursed; in the next place, 'giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity.","For if these things be in you and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord' and Saviour 'Jesus Christ' (2 Peter 1:5-8).","There is a method that the Holy Ghost has prescribed in the Word, for them that hath faith to observe, and without the observation thereof, though they indeed may be of the number of them that shall be saved, yet they shall not have much, nor do much, for Christ and his name, in this world.","Now the unskilful, that are so in the word of righteousness, finding this method, and not discerning to whom it belongs, forthwith apply it to all; and forgetting that faith must go before, they press them as duties preparatory to faith, or else so call that which is not so; and so the blind leading of the blind, both fall into the ditch, and are smothered.","But do thou, O child of God, distinguish, and keep faith and duty for justification of thy person in the sight of God far asunder; also be sure to let faith go before, and be always with thy Saviour, but add unto thy faith, virtue, &c., not as though thy faith could not lay hold of Christ, unless accompanied with these, but to show that thy faith is of the right kind, as also for the emboldening of thee to an holy endeavour yet to press further into his everlasting kingdom and his word; for he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.",Fifth.,"That thou mayest keep steadfast to this doctrine take heed of being offended, or of stumbling at the Word, because of the offensive lives and conversations of some that are professors of the same.","There will be offences, and it is needful there should; yea, scandals and heresies also, that they that are approved of God 'may be made manifest among you' (1 Cor 11:19).","There are many causes of the offensive lives of them that profess this faith, some of which I will give a touch upon here.",1.,"Many that adhere to, and profess this gospel, are short of the power and glory of the things which they profess: now the word, the word only, will not bring those that profess it into a conformity to it; into a conformity in heart and life (1 Cor 4:18-20).","Wherefore they that know it only in word, live scandalous lives, to the reproach of the faith, the emboldening of its enemies, the stumbling of the ignorant, and grief of the godly, that are so indeed, and such must bear their judgment in the next world.",2.,"This also flows from the wisdom of hell: the devil knows that the faith of the gospel rightly professed, is, not only saving to those in whom it is, but alluring unto beholders: wherefore that he may prevent the beauteous lustre thereof, he sows his tares among God's wheat, and goes his way, that is, to the end those that stumble may not see what he hath done, or whose are the tares indeed.","Now by these the sunshine of the faith of the true professors of the blessed gospel is clouded; yea, and the world made believe, that such as the worst are, such are the best; but there is never a barrel better herring,[34] but that the whole lump of them are, in truth, a pack of knaves.","Now has the devil got the point aimed at, and has caused many to fall; but behold ye now the good reward these tares shall have at the day of reward for their doings.","'As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the end of this world.","The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity, and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth' (Mat 13:37-42).",3.,"It also happeneth, sometimes, through the anger and judgment of God against sinners, that some of them truly gracious do fall, as David, Peter, &c., the which is a great trial to the godly, a wound to the persons fallen, and a judgment of God to the world.","For since these last would not be converted, nor made turn to God by the convincing glory that has attended their faith in a holy and unblameable life annexed, God has suffered them to fall, that they also might stumble and fall, and be dashed in pieces by their vices.","But thou, Christian man, be not thou offended at any of these things; do thou look unto Jesus, do thou look unto his Word, do thou live by faith, and think much of thy latter end; do thou be base in thine own eyes, be humble and tender, and pray to God always; do thou add to thy faith virtue, and to virtue what else is mentioned; and 'give diligence to make thy calling and election sure; for if thou doest these things thou shalt never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly, into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ' (2 Peter 1:10,11).",Sixth.,"If it be so, that there is so much mercy in the heart of God for his people, and that Jesus his Son has by his blood made so living a way for us that we might enjoy it, and the benefit of it for ever, 'then let Israel hope': for to that end is this goodness revealed: 'Let Israel hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.'",Hope!,"Who would not hope to enjoy life eternal, that has an inheritance in the God of Israel?","'Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like unto thee, O people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency?'",(Deut 33:29).,"Did but the people of God see to what they are born, and how true the God of truth will be to what by his Word they look for at his hands, they would be above alway; they would be weary of life, of estates, of relations; they would groan earnestly under all their enjoyments to be with him, who is their life, their portion, and their glory for ever.","But we profess, and yet care not for dying; we profess, and yet long not for the coming of the day of God; we profess the faith, and yet by our whole life show to them that can see how little a measure of it we have in our hearts.","The Lord lead us more into the power of things; then shall the virtues of him that has saved us, and called us out of darkness into his marvellous light, and the savour of his good knowledge, be made known to others far otherwise than it is.",Amen.,Seventh.,"And lastly, Sinner, doth not all this discourse make thy heart twitter after the mercy that is with God, and after the way that is made by this plenteous redemption thereto?","Methinks it should; yea, thou couldst not do otherwise, didst thou but see thy condition: look behind thee, take a view of the path thou hast trodden these many years.","Dost thou think that the way that thou art in will lead thee to the strait gate, sinner?","Ponder the path of thy feet with the greatest seriousness, thy life lies upon it; what thinkest thou?","But make no answer till in the night, till thou art in the night-watches.","'Commune with your own heart upon your bed' (Psa 4:4), and then say what thou thinkest of, whether thou art going?",O that thou wert serious!,"Is not it a thing to be lamented, that madness and folly should be in thy heart while thou livest, and after that to go to the dead, when so much life stands before thee, and light to see the way to it?",(Eccl 9:3).,"Surely, men void of grace, and possessed of carnal minds, must either think that sin is nothing, that hell is easy, and that eternity is short; or else that whatever God has said about the punishing of sinners, he will never do as he has said; or that there is no sin, no God, no heaven, no hell, and so no good or bad hereafter; or else they could not live as they do.","But perhaps thou presumest upon it, and sayest, I shall have peace, though I live so sinful a life.","Sinner, if this wicked thought be in thy heart, tell me again, dost thou thus think in earnest?","Canst thou imagine thou shalt at the day of account out-face God, or make him believe thou wast what thou wast not?","or that when the gate of mercy is shut up in wrath, he will at thy pleasure, and to the reversing of his own counsel, open it again to thee?","Why shall thy deceived heart turn thee aside, that thou canst not deliver thy soul, 'nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?'",(Isa 44:20).,FOOTNOTES: [1] The titles to the Psalms have puzzled all the commentators.,"Bunyan follows Luther; who adds, that the title to the Psalms of Degrees does not pertain to any doctrine, but only to the ceremony of the singers.","Ainsworth applies it to the place or tone of voice of the singers, or to a special excellency of the Psalm.","Calmet and Bishop Horsley consider that the title refers to the progress of the soul towards eternal felicity, ascending by degrees.",Watford imagines that these Psalms were written or selected to be sung on the ascent of the Jews from the captivity in Babylon.,Luther wisely concludes that the Christian has only to do with the brief and very notable doctrine contained in these fifteen steps or degrees.--Ed.,"[2] 'The hither,' or nearest end;

unprofitable ceremonies hath occasioned much mischief; its estimation hath been raised by prelates, as if there were no other way of worship; making it an idol to the ignorant and superstitious, a matter of endless strife, and of increasing an idle ministry.","Bunyan had weighed these observations, and recollected his former ignorance and superstition, when he counted all things holy connected with the outward forms, and did ""very devoutly say and sing as others did.","""4 But when he arose from the long and dread conflict with sin, and entered upon his Christian life, he decidedly preferred emancipation from forms of prayer, and treated them with great severity.",He considered that the most essential qualification for the Christian ministry is the gift of prayer.,"Upon this subject learned and pious men have differed;

and it is a clear, concise, and scriptural discourse, setting forth his views upon this most important subject.","Any preconceived form would have fettered Bunyan's free spirit; he was a giant in prayer, and commanded the deepest reverence while leading the public devotions of the largest congregations.","The great question as to public prayer is whether the minister should, relying upon Divine assistance, offer up prayer to God in the Saviour's name, immediately conceived under a sense of His presence; or whether it is better, as it is certainly easier, to read a form of prayer, from time to time, skillfully arranged, and with every regard to beauty of language?","Which of these modes is most in accordance with the directions of the Sacred Scriptures, and most likely to be attended with spiritual benefit to the assembled church?",Surely this inquiry does not involve the charge of schism or heresy upon either party.,"""Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.""",Nor should such differences lead us to despise each other.,"Let our first inquiry be, whether the Saviour intended a fixed form of prayer?","And if so, did he give His church any other than that most beautiful and comprehensive form called the Lord's Prayer?","And did he license any one, and if so, who, to alter, add to, or diminish from it?","On the other hand, should we conclude that ""We know not what we should pray for as we ought, only as the Spirit helpeth our infirmities,"" then must we rely, as Bunyan did, upon the promised aid of that gracious Spirit.","Blessed, indeed, are those whose intercourse with heaven sheds an influence on their whole conduct, gives them abundance of well-arranged words in praying with their families and with the sick or dejected, and--whose lives prove that they have been with Jesus, and are taught by him, or who, in Scripture language, ""pray with the spirit and with the understanding also.""",GEO.,OFFOR.,ON PRAYING IN THE SPIRIT.,"""I WILL PRAY WITH THE SPIRIT, AND I WILL PRAY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING ALSO""--(I Cor 14:15).","PRAYER is an ORDINANCE of God, and that to be used both in public and private;

as also between that in the heart, and that with the vocal voice.","Something also might be spoken to distinguish between the gifts and graces of prayer; but eschewing this method, my business shall be at this time only to show you the very heart of prayer, without which, all your lifting up, both of hands, and eyes, and voices, will be to no purpose at all.","""I will pray with the Spirit.""","The method that I shall go on in at this time shall be, FIRST.",To show you what true prayer is.,SECOND.,To show you what it is to pray with the Spirit.,THIRD.,What it is to pray with the Spirit and understanding also.,"And so, FOURTHLY.",To make some short use and application of what shall be spoken.,WHAT PRAYER IS.,"FIRST, What [true] prayer is.","Prayer is a sincere, sensible, affectionate pouring out of the heart or soul to God, through Christ, in the strength and assistance of the Holy Spirit, for such things as God hath promised, or according to the Word, for the good of the church, with submission, in faith, to the will of God.",In this description are these seven things.,"First, It is a sincere; Second, A sensible; Third, An affectionate, pouring out of the soul to God, through Christ; Fourth, By the strength or assistance of the Spirit; Fifth, For such things as God hath promised, or, according to his word; Sixth, For the good of the church; Seventh, With submission in faith to the will of God.",First.,"For the first of these, it is a SINCERE pouring out of the soul to God.","Sincerity is such a grace as runs through all the graces of God in us, and through all the actings of a Christian, and hath the sway in them too, or else their actings are not any thing regarded of God, and so of and in prayer, of which particularly David speaks, when he mentions prayer.","""I cried unto him,"" the Lord ""with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.","If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear"" my prayer (Psa 66:17,18).","Part of the exercise of prayer is sincerity, without which God looks not upon it as prayer in a good sense (Psa 16:1-4).","Then ""ye shall seek me and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart"" (Jer 29:12-13).","The want of this made the Lord reject their prayers in Hosea 7:14, where he saith, ""They have not cried unto me with their heart,"" that is, in sincerity, ""when they howled upon their beds.""","But for a pretence, for a show in hypocrisy, to be seen of men, and applauded for the same, they prayed.","Sincerity was that which Christ commended in Nathaniel, when he was under the fig tree.","""Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.""","Probably this good man was pouring out of his soul to God in prayer under the fig tree, and that in a sincere and unfeigned spirit before the Lord.","The prayer that hath this in it as one of the principal ingredients, is the prayer that God looks at.","Thus, ""The prayer of the upright is his delight"" (Prov 15:8).","And why must sincerity be one of the essentials of prayer which is accepted of God, but because sincerity carries the soul in all simplicity to open its heart to God, and to tell him the case plainly, without equivocation; to condemn itself plainly, without dissembling; to cry to God heartily, without complimenting.","""I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou has chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke"" (Jer 31:18).","Sincerity is the same in a corner alone, as it is before the face of the world.","It knows not how to wear two vizards, one for an appearance before men, and another for a short snatch in a corner; but it must have God, and be with him in the duty of prayer.","It is not lip-labour that it doth regard, for it is the heart that God looks at, and that which sincerity looks at, and that which prayer comes from, if it be that prayer which is accompanied with sincerity.",Second.,It is a sincere and SENSIBLE pouring out of the heart or soul.,"It is not, as many take it to be, even a few babbling, prating, complimentary expressions, but a sensible feeling there is in the heart.","Prayer hath in it a sensibleness of diverse things; sometimes sense of sin, sometimes of mercy received, sometimes of the readiness of God to give mercy, &c. 1.","A sense of the want of mercy, by reason of the danger of sin.","The soul, I say, feels, and from feeling sighs, groans, and breaks at the heart.","For right prayer bubbleth out of the heart when it is overpressed with grief and bitterness, as blood is forced out of the flesh by reason of some heavy burden that lieth upon it (I Sam 1:10; Psa 69:3).","David roars, cries, weeps, faints at heart, fails at the eyes, loseth his moisture, &c., (Psa 38:8-10).",Hezekiah mourns like a dove (Isa 38:14).,Ephraim bemoans himself (Jer 31:18).,Peter weeps bitterly (Matt 26:75).,Christ hath strong cryings and tears (Heb 5:7).,"And all this from a sense of the justice of God, the guilt of sin, the pains of hell and destruction.","""The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.""","Then cried I unto the Lord (Psa 116:3,4).","And in another place, ""My sore ran in the night"" (Psa 77:2).","Again, ""I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long"" (Psa 38:6).","In all these instances, and in hundreds more that might be named, you may see that prayer carrieth in it a sensible feeling disposition, and that first from a sense of sin.",2.,"Sometimes there is a sweet sense of mercy received; encouraging, comforting, strengthening, enlivening, enlightening mercy, &c. Thus David pours out his soul, to bless, and praise, and admire the great God for his loving-kindness to such poor vile wretches.","""Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me bless his holy name.","Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.6 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases; who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies; who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's"" (Psa 103:1-5).","And thus is the prayer of saints sometimes turned into praise and thanksgiving, and yet are prayers still.","This is a mystery; God's people pray with their praises, as it is written, ""Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer, and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your request be made known unto God"" (Phil 4:6).","A sensible thanksgiving, for mercies received, is a mighty prayer in the sight of God; it prevails with him unspeakably.",3.,In prayer there is sometimes in the soul a sense of mercy to be received.,This again sets the soul all on a flame.,"""Thou, O lord of hosts,"" saith David, ""hast revealed to thy servant, saying I will build thee an house; therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray--unto thee"" (II Sam 7:27).","This provoked Jacob, David, Daniel, with others--even a sense of mercies to be received--which caused them, not by fits and starts, nor yet in a foolish frothy way, to babble over a few words written in a paper; but mightily, fervently, and continually, to groan out their conditions before the Lord, as being sensible, sensible, I say, of their wants, their misery, and the willingness of God to show mercy (Gen 32:10,11; Dan 9:3,4).","A good sense of sin, and the wrath of God, with some encouragement from God to come unto him, is a better Common-prayer-book than that which is taken out of the Papistical mass-book,7 being the scraps and fragments of the devices of some popes, some friars, and I wot not what.",Third.,"Prayer is a sincere, sensible, and an AFFECTIONATE pouring out of the soul to God.",O!,"the heat, strength, life, vigour, and affection, that is in right prayer!","""As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God"" (Psa 42:1).","""I have longed after thy precepts"" (Psa 119:40).","""I have longed for thy salvation"" (ver 174).","""My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth, for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God"" (Psa 84:2).","""My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times"" (Psa 119:20).","Mark ye here, ""My soul longeth,"" it longeth, it longeth, &c. O what affection is here discovered in prayer!",The like you have in Daniel.,"""O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God"" (Dan 9:19).",Every syllable carrieth a mighty vehemency in it.,"This is called the fervent, or the working prayer, by James.","And so again, ""And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly"" (Luke 22:44).",Or had his affections more and more drawn out after God for his helping hand.,O!,"How wide are the most of men with their prayers from this prayer, that is, PRAYER in God's account!",Alas!,"The greatest part of men make no conscience at all of the duty; and as for them that do, it is to be feared that many of them are very great strangers to a sincere, sensible, and affectionate pouring out their hearts or souls to God; but even content themselves with a little lip-labour and bodily exercise, mumbling over a few imaginary prayers.","When the affections are indeed engaged in prayer, then, then the whole man is engaged, and that in such sort, that the soul will spend itself to nothing, as it were, rather than it will go without that good desired, even communion and solace with Christ.","And hence it is that the saints have spent their strengths, and lost their lives, rather than go without the blessing (Psa 69:3; 38:9,10; Gen 32:24,26).","All this is too, too evident by the ignorance, profaneness, and spirit of envy, that reign in the hearts of those men that are so hot for the forms, and not the power of praying.","Scarce one of forty among them know what it is to be born again, to have communion with the Father through the Son; to feel the power of grace sanctifying their hearts: but for all their prayers, they still live cursed, drunken, whorish, and abominable lives, full of malice, envy, deceit, persecuting of the dear children of God.",O what a dreadful after-clap is coming upon them!,"which all their hypocritical assembling themselves together, with all their prayers, shall never be able to help them against, or shelter them from.","Again, It is a pouring out of the heart or soul.","There is in prayer an unbosoming of a man's self, an opening of the heart to God, an affectionate pouring out of the soul in requests, sighs, and groans.","""All my desire is before thee,"" saith David, ""and my groaning is not hid from thee"" (Psa 38:9).","And again, ""My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God.",When shall I come and appear before God?,"When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me"" (Psa 42:2,4).","Mark, ""I pour out my soul.""","It is an expression signifying, that in prayer there goeth the very life and whole strength to God.","As in another place, ""Trust in him at all times; ye people,--pour out your heart before him"" (Psa 62:8).","This is the prayer to which the promise is made, for the delivering of a poor creature out of captivity and thralldom.","""If from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul"" (Deut 4:29).","Again, It is a pouring out of the heart or soul TO GOD.",This showeth also the excellency of the spirit of prayer.,It is the great God to which it retires.,"""When shall I come and appear before God?""","And it argueth, that the soul that thus prayeth indeed, sees an emptiness in all things under heaven; that in God alone there is rest and satisfaction for the soul.","""Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God"" (I Tim 5:5).","So saith David, ""In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust;

""for he that cometh to God, must believe that he is"" (Heb 11:6).","And so he that comes to God through Christ, must be enabled to know Christ.","Lord, saith Moses, ""show me now thy way, that I may know thee"" (Exo 33:13).","This Christ, none but the Father can reveal (Matt 11:27).","And to come through Christ, is for the soul to be enabled of God to shroud itself under the shadow of the Lord Jesus, as a man shroudeth himself under a thing for safeguard (Matt 16:16).8 Hence it is that David so often terms Christ his shield, buckler, tower, fortress, rock of defence, &c., (Psa 18:2; 27:1; 28:1).","Not only because by him he overcame his enemies, but because through him he found favour with God the Father.","And so he saith to Abraham, ""Fear not, I am thy shield,"" &c., (Gen 15:1).","The man then that comes to God through Christ, must have faith, by which he puts on Christ, and in him appears before God.","Now he that hath faith is born of God, born again, and so becomes one of the sons of God; by virtue of which he is joined to Christ, and made a member of him (John 3:5,7; 1:12).","And therefore, secondly he, as a member of Christ, comes to God; I say, as a member of him, so that God looks on that man as a part of Christ, part of his body, flesh, and bones, united to him by election, conversion, illumination, the Spirit being conveyed into the heart of that poor man by God (Eph 5:30).","So that now he comes to God in Christ's merits, in his blood, righteousness, victory, intercession, and so stands before him, being ""accepted in his Beloved"" (Eph 1:6).","And because this poor creature is thus a member of the Lord Jesus, and under this consideration hath admittance to come to God; therefore, by virtue of this union also, is the Holy Spirit conveyed into him, whereby he is able to pour out himself, to wit, his soul, before God, with his audience.","And this leads me to the next, or fourth particular.",Fourth.,"Prayer is a sincere, sensible, affectionate, pouring out of the heart or soul to God through Christ, by the strength or ASSISTANCE OF THE SPIRIT.","For these things do so depend one upon another, that it is impossible that it should be prayer, without there be a joint concurrence of them; for though it be never so famous, yet without these things, it is only such prayer as is rejected of God.","For without a sincere, sensible, affectionate pouring out of the heart to God, it is but lip-labour; and if it be not through Christ, it falleth far short of ever sounding well in the ears of God.","So also, if it be not in the strength and assistance of the Spirit, it is but like the sons of Aaron, offering with strange fire (Lev 10:1,2).","But I shall speak more to this under the second head; and therefore in the meantime, that which is not petitioned through the teaching and assistance of the Spirit, it is not possible that it should be ""according to the will of God"" (Rom 8:26,27).",Fifth.,"Prayer is a sincere, sensible, affectionate pouring out of the heart, or soul, to God, through Christ, in the strength and assistance of the Spirit, FOR SUCH THINGS AS GOD HATH PROMISED, &c., (Matt 6:6-8).","Prayer it is, when it is within the compass of God's Word; and it is blasphemy, or at best vain babbling, when the petition is beside the book.",David therefore still in his prayer kept his eye on the Word of God.,"""My soul,"" saith he, ""cleaveth to the dust; quicken me according to thy word.""","And again, ""My soul melteth for heaviness, strengthen thou me according unto thy word"" (Psa 119:25-28; see also 41, 42, 58, 65, 74, 81, 82, 107, 147, 154, 169, 170).","And, ""remember thy word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope"" (ver 49).","And indeed the Holy Ghost doth not immediately quicken and stir up the heart of the Christian without, but by, with, and through the Word, by bringing that to the heart, and by opening of that, whereby the man is provoked to go to the Lord, and to tell him how it is with him, and also to argue, and supplicate, according to the Word; thus it was with Daniel, that mighty prophet of the Lord.","He understanding by books that the captivity of the children of Israel was hard at an end; then, according unto that word, he maketh his prayer to God.","""I Daniel,"" saith he, ""understood by books,"" viz., the writings of Jeremiah, ""the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah,--that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.","And I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes"" (Dan 9:2,3).","So that I say, as the Spirit is the helper and the governor of the soul, when it prayeth according to the will of God; so it guideth by and according to, the Word of God and his promise.","Hence it is that our Lord Jesus Christ himself did make a stop, although his life lay at stake for it.","I could now pray to my Father, and he should give me more than twelve legions of angels; but how then must the scripture be fulfilled that thus it must be?","(Matt 26:53,54).","As who should say, Were there but a word for it in the scripture, I should soon be out of the hands of mine enemies, I should be helped by angels; but the scripture will not warrant this kind of praying, for that saith otherwise.",It is a praying then according to the Word and promise.,"The Spirit by the Word must direct, as well in the manner, as in the matter of prayer.","""I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also"" (I Cor 14:15).",But there is no understanding without the Word.,"For if they reject the word of the Lord, ""what wisdom is in them?""",(Jer 8:9).,Sixth.,FOR THE GOOD OF THE CHURCH.,"This clause reacheth in whatsoever tendeth either to the honour of God, Christ's advancement, or his people's benefit.","For God, and Christ, and his people are so linked together that if the good of the one be prayed for, to wit, the church, the glory of God, and advancement of Christ, must needs be included.","For as Christ is in the Father, so the saints are in Christ; and he that toucheth the saints, toucheth the apple of God's eye; and therefore pray for the peace of Jerusalem, and you pray for all that is required of you.",For Jerusalem will never be in perfect peace until she be in heaven; and there is nothing that Christ doth more desire than to have her there.,That also is the place that God through Christ hath given to her.,"He then that prayeth for the peace and good of Zion, or the church, doth ask that in prayer which Christ hath purchased with his blood; and also that which the Father hath given to him as the price thereof.","Now he that prayeth for this, must pray for abundance of grace for the church, for help against all its temptations; that God would let nothing be too hard for it; and that all things might work together for its good, that God would keep them blameless and harmless, the sons of God, to his glory, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation.",And this is the substance of Christ's own prayer in John 17.,"And all Paul's prayers did run that way, as one of his prayers doth eminently show.","""And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all judgment; that ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere, and without offence, till the day of Christ.","Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God"" (Phil 1:9-11).","But a short prayer, you see, and yet full of good desires for the church, from the beginning to the end; that it may stand and go on, and that in the most excellent frame of spirit, even without blame, sincere, and without offence, until the day of Christ, let its temptations or persecutions be what they will (Eph 1:16-21; 3:14-19; Col 1:9-13).",Seventh.,"And because, as I said, prayer doth SUBMIT TO THE WILL OF GOD, and say, Thy will be done, as Christ hath taught us (Matt 6:10); therefore the people of the Lord in humility are to lay themselves and their prayers, and all that they have, at the foot of their God, to be disposed of by him as he in his heavenly wisdom seeth best.",Yet not doubting but God will answer the desire of his people that way that shall be most for their advantage and his glory.,"When the saints therefore do pray with submission to the will of God, it doth not argue that they are to doubt or question God's love and kindness to them.","But because they at all times are not so wise, but that sometimes Satan may get that advantage of them, as to tempt them to pray for that which, if they had it, would neither prove to God's glory nor his people's good.","""Yet this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us; and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him,"" that is, we asking in the Spirit of grace and supplication (I John 5:14,15).","For, as I said before, that petition that is not put up in and through the Spirit, it is not to be answered, because it is beside the will of God.","For the Spirit only knoweth that, and so consequently knoweth how to pray according to that will of God.","""For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?","even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God"" (I Cor 2:11).",But more of this hereafter.,"Thus you see, first, what prayer is.",Now to proceed.,[WHAT IT IS TO PRAY WITH THE SPIRIT.],SECOND.,I will pray with the Spirit.,"Now to pray with the Spirit--for that is the praying man, and none else, so as to be accepted of God--it is for a man, as aforesaid, sincerely and sensibly, with affection, to come to God through Christ, &c.; which sincere, sensible, and affectionate coming must be by the working of God's Spirit.","There is no man nor church in the world that can come to God in prayer, but by the assistance of the Holy Spirit.","""For through Christ we all have access by one Spirit unto the Father"" (Eph 2:18).","Wherefore Paul saith, ""For we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.","And he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God"" (Rom 8:26,27).","And because there is in this scripture so full a discovery of the spirit of prayer, and of man's inability to pray without it; therefore I shall in a few words comment upon it.","""For we.""","Consider first the person speaking, even Paul, and, in his person, all the apostles.","We apostles, we extraordinary officers, the wise master-builders, that have some of us been caught up into paradise (Rom 15:16; I Cor 3:10; II Cor 12:4).","""We know not what we should pray for.""","Surely there is no man but will confess, that Paul and his companions were as able to have done any work for God, as any pope or proud prelate in the church of Rome, and could as well have made a Common Prayer Book as those who at first composed this; as being not a whit behind them either in grace or gifts.9 ""For we know not what we should pray for.""","We know not the matter of the things for which we should pray, neither the object to whom we pray, nor the medium by or through whom we pray; none of these things know we, but by the help and assistance of the Spirit.",Should we pray for communion with God through Christ?,"should we pray for faith, for justification by grace, and a truly sanctified heart?",none of these things know we.,"""For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?","even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God"" (I Cor 2:11).","But here, alas!","the apostles speak of inward and spiritual things, which the world knows not (Isa 29:11).","Again, as they know not the matter, &c., of prayer, without the help of the Spirit; so neither know they the manner thereof without the same; and therefore he adds, ""We know not what we should pray for as we ought""; but the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, with sighs and groans which cannot be uttered.","Mark here, they could not so well and so fully come off in the manner of performing this duty, as these in our days think they can.","The apostles, when they were at the best, yea, when the Holy Ghost assisted them, yet then they were fain to come off with sighs and groans, falling short of expressing their mind, but with sighs and groans which cannot be uttered.","But here now, the wise men of our days are so well skilled as that they have both the manner and matter of their prayers at their finger-ends; setting such a prayer for such a day, and that twenty years before it comes.","One for Christmas, another for Easter, and six days after that.",They have also bounded how many syllables must be said in every one of them at their public exercises.,"For each saint's day, also, they have them ready for the generations yet unborn to say.","They can tell you, also, when you shall kneel, when you shall stand, when you should abide in your seats, when you should go up into the chancel, and what you should do when you come there.","All which the apostles came short of, as not being able to compose so profound a manner; and that for this reason included in this scripture, because the fear of God tied them to pray as they ought.","""For we know not what we should pray for as we ought.""","Mark this, ""as we ought.""","For the not thinking of this word, or at least the not understanding it in the spirit and truth of it, hath occasioned these men to devise, as Jeroboam did, another way of worship, both for matter and manner, than is revealed in the Word of God (I Kings 12:26-33).","But, saith Paul, we must pray as we ought; and this WE cannot do by all the art, skill, and cunning device of men or angels.","""For we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit""; nay, further, it must be ""the Spirit ITSELF"" that helpeth our infirmities; not the Spirit and man's lusts; what man of his own brain may imagine and devise, is one thing, and what they are commanded, and ought to do, is another.","Many ask and have not, because they ask amiss; and so are never the nearer the enjoying of those things they petition for (James 4:3).","It is not to pray at random that will put off God, or cause him to answer.","While prayer is making, God is searching the heart, to see from what root and spirit it doth arise (I John 5:14).","""And he that searcheth the heart knoweth,"" that is, approveth only, the meaning ""of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.""","For in that which is according to his will only, he heareth us, and in nothing else.","And it is the Spirit only that can teach us so to ask; it only being able to search out all things, even the deep things of God.","Without which Spirit, though we had a thousand Common Prayer Books, yet we know not what we should pray for as we ought, being accompanied with those infirmities that make us absolutely incapable of such a work.","Which infirmities, although it is a hard thing to name them all, yet some of them are these that follow.",First.,"Without the Spirit man is so infirm that he cannot, with all other means whatsoever, be enabled to think one right saving thought of God, of Christ, or of his blessed things; and therefore he saith of the wicked, ""God is not in all his thoughts,"" (Psa 10:4); unless it be that they imagine him altogether such a one as themselves (Psa 50:21).","For ""every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil,"" and that ""continually"" (Gen 6:5; 8:21).","They then not being able to conceive aright of God to whom they pray, of Christ through whom they pray, nor of the things for which they pray, as is before showed, how shall they be able to address themselves to God, without the Spirit help this infirmity?","Peradventure you will say, By the help of the Common Prayer Book; but that cannot do it, unless it can open the eyes, and reveal to the soul all these things before touched.","Which that it cannot, it is evident; because that is the work of the Spirit only.","The Spirit itself is the revealer of these things to poor souls, and that which doth give us to understand them; wherefore Christ tells his disciples, when he promised to send the Spirit, the Comforter, ""He shall take of mine and show unto you""; as if he had said, I know you are naturally dark and ignorant as to the understanding any of my things; though ye try this course and the other, yet your ignorance will still remain, the veil is spread over your heart, and there is none can take away the same, nor give you spiritual understanding but the Spirit.","The Common Prayer Book will not do it, neither can any man expect that it should be instrumental that way, it being none of God's ordinances; but a thing since the Scriptures were written, patched together one piece at one time, and another at another; a mere human invention and institution, which God is so far from owning of, that he expressly forbids it, with any other such like, and that by manifold sayings in his most holy and blessed Word.","(See Mark 7:7,8, and Col 2:16-23; Deut 12:30-32; Prov 30:6; Deut 4:2; Rev 22:18).","For right prayer must, as well in the outward part of it, in the outward expression, as in the inward intention, come from what the soul doth apprehend in the light of the Spirit; otherwise it is condemned as vain and an abomination, because the heart and tongue do not go along jointly in the same, neither indeed can they, unless the Spirit help our infirmities (Mark 7; Prov 28:9; Isa 29:13).","And this David knew full well, which did make him cry, ""Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall show forth thy praise"" (Psa 51:15).","I suppose there is none can imagine but that David could speak and express himself as well as others, nay, as any in our generation, as is clearly manifested by his word and his works.","Nevertheless when this good man, this prophet, comes into God's worship, then the Lord must help, or he can do nothing.","""Lord, open thou my lips, and"" then ""my mouth shall show forth thy praise.""","He could not speak one right word, except the Spirit itself gave utterance.","""For we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself helpeth our infirmities.""","But, Second.","It must be a praying with the Spirit, that is, the effectual praying; because without that, as men are senseless, so hypocritical, cold, and unseemly in their prayers; and so they, with their prayers, are both rendered abominable to God (Matt 23:14; Mark 12:40; Luke 18:11, 12; Isa 58:2, 3).","It is not the excellency of the voice, nor the seeming affection, and earnestness of him that prayeth, that is anything regarded of God without it.","For man, as man, is so full of all manner of wickedness, that as he cannot keep a word, or thought, so much less a piece of prayer clean, and acceptable to God through Christ; and for this cause the Pharisees, with their prayers, were rejected.","No question but they were excellently able to express themselves in words, and also for length of time, too, they were very notable; but they had not the Spirit of Jesus Christ to help them, and therefore they did what they did with their infirmities or weaknesses only, and so fell short of a sincere, sensible, affectionate pouring out of their souls to God, through the strength of the Spirit.","That is the prayer that goeth to heaven, that is sent thither in the strength of the Spirit.","For, Third.","Nothing but the Spirit can show a man clearly his misery by nature, and so put a man into a posture of prayer.","Talk is but talk, as we use to say, and so it is but mouth-worship, if there be not a sense of misery, and that effectually too.","O the cursed hypocrisy that is in most hearts, and that accompanieth many thousands of praying men that would be so looked upon in this day, and all for want of a sense of their misery!","But now the Spirit, that will sweetly show the soul its misery, where it is, and what is like to become of it, also the intolerableness of that condition.","For it is the Spirit that doth effectually convince of sin and misery, without the Lord Jesus, and so puts the soul into a sweet, sensible, affectionate way of praying to God according to his word (John 16:7-9).",Fourth.,"If men did see their sins, yet without the help of the Spirit they would not pray.","For they would run away from God, with Cain and Judas, and utterly despair of mercy, were it not for the Spirit.","When a man is indeed sensible of his sin, and God's curse, then it is a hard thing to persuade him to pray; for, saith his heart, ""There is no hope,"" it is in vain to seek God (Jer 2:25; 18:12).","I am so vile, so wretched, and so cursed a creature, that I shall never be regarded!","Now here comes the Spirit, and stayeth the soul, helpeth it to hold up its face to God, by letting into the heart some small sense of mercy to encourage it to go to God, and hence it is called ""the Comforter"" (John 14:26).",Fifth.,It must be in or with the Spirit; for without that no man can know how he should come to God the right way.,"Men may easily say they come to God in his Son: but it is the hardest thing of a thousand to come to God aright and in his own way, without the Spirit.","It is ""the Spirit"" that ""searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God"" (I Cor 2:10).","It is the Spirit that must show us the way of coming to God, and also what there is in God that makes him desirable: ""I pray thee,"" saith Moses, ""show me now thy way, that I may know thee"" (Exo 33:13).","And, He shall take of mine, and ""show it unto you"" (John 16:14).",Sixth.,"Because without the Spirit, though a man did see his misery, and also the way to come to God; yet he would never be able to claim a share in either God, Christ, or mercy, with God's approbation.","O how great a task is it, for a poor soul that becomes sensible of sin and the wrath of God, to say in faith, but this one word, ""Father!""","I tell you, however hypocrites think, yet the Christian that is so indeed finds all the difficulty in this very thing, it cannot say God is its Father.",O!,"saith he, I dare not call him Father; and hence it is that the Spirit must be sent into the hearts of God's people for this very thing, to cry Father: it being too great a work for any man to do knowingly and believingly without it (Gal 4:6).","When I say knowingly, I mean, knowing what it is to be a child of God, and to be born again.","And when I say believingly, I mean, for the soul to believe, and that from good experience, that the work of grace is wrought in him.","This is the right calling of God Father; and not as many do, to say in a babbling way, the Lord's prayer (so called) by heart, as it lieth in the words of the book.","No, here is the life of prayer, when in or with the Spirit, a man being made sensible of sin, and how to come to the Lord for mercy; he comes, I say, in the strength of the Spirit, and crieth Father.","That one word spoken in faith, is better than a thousand prayers, as men call them, written and read, in a formal, cold, lukewarm way.","O how far short are those people of being sensible of this, who count it enough to teach themselves and children to say the Lord's prayer, the creed, with other sayings; when, as God knows, they are senseless of themselves, their misery, or what it is to be brought to God through Christ!","Ah, poor soul!","Study your misery, and cry to God to show you your confused blindness and ignorance, before you be so rife in calling God your Father, or teaching your children either so to say.","And know, that to say God is your Father, in a way of prayer or conference, without any experiment of the work of grace on your souls, it is to say you are Jews and are not, and so to lie.","You say, Our Father; God saith, You blaspheme!","You say you are Jew, that is, true Christians; God saith, You lie!","""Behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie"" (Rev 3:9).","""And I know the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan"" (Rev 2:9).","And so much the greater the sin is, by how much the more the sinner boasts it with a pretended sanctity, as the Jews did to Christ, in the 8th of John, which made Christ, even in plain terms, to tell them their doom, for all their hypocritical pretences (John 8:41-45).","And yet forsooth every cursed whoremaster, thief, and drunkard, swearer, and perjured person; they that have not only been such in times past, but are even so still: these I say, by some must be counted the only honest men, and all because with their blasphemous throats, and hypocritical hearts, they will come to church, and say, ""Our Father!""","Nay further, these men, though every time they say to God, Our Father, do most abominably blaspheme, yet they must be compelled thus to do.","And because others that are of more sober principles, scruple the truth of such vain traditions; therefore they must be looked upon to be the only enemies of God and the nation: when as it is their own cursed superstition that doth set the great God against them, and cause him to count them for his enemies (Isa 53:10).","And yet just like to Bonner, that blood-red persecutor, they commend, I say, these wretches, although never so vile, if they close in with their traditions, to be good churchmen, the honest subjects; while God's people are, as it hath always been, looked upon to be a turbulent, seditious, and factious people (Ezra 4:12-16).","Therefore give me leave a little to reason with thee, thou poor, blind, ignorant sot.",(1.),"It may be thy great prayer is to say, ""Our Father which art in heaven,"" &c. Dost thou know the meaning of the very first words of this prayer?","Canst thou indeed, with the rest of the saints, cry, Our Father?",Art thou truly born again?,Hast thou received the spirit of adoption?,"Dost thou see thyself in Christ, and canst thou come to God as a member of him?","Or art thou ignorant of these things, and yet darest thou say, Our Father?",Is not the devil thy father?,(John 8:44).,And dost thou not do the deeds of the flesh?,"And yet darest thou say to God, Our Father?","Nay, art thou not a desperate persecutor of the children of God?",Hast thou not cursed them in thine heart many a time?,"And yet dost thou out of thy blasphemous throat suffer these words to come, even our Father?",He is their Father whom thou hatest and persecutest.,"But as the devil presented himself amongst the sons of God, (Job 1), when they were to present themselves before the Father, even our Father, so is it now; because the saints were commanded to say, Our Father, therefore all the blind ignorant rabble in the world, they must also use the same words, Our Father.",(2.),"And dost thou indeed say, ""Hallowed be thy name"" with thy heart?","Dost thou study, by all honest and lawful ways, to advance the name, holiness, and majesty of God?",Doth thy heart and conversation agree with this passage?,"Dost thou strive to imitate Christ in all the works of righteousness, which God doth command of thee, and prompt thee forward to?","It is so, if thou be one that can truly with God's allowance cry, ""Our Father.""",Or is it not the least of thy thoughts all the day?,"And dost thou not clearly make it appear, that thou art a cursed hypocrite, by condemning that with thy daily practice, which thou pretendest in thy praying with thy dissembling tongue?",(3.),"Wouldst thou have the kingdom of God come indeed, and also his will to be done in earth as it is in heaven?","Nay, notwithstanding, thou according to the form, sayest, Thy kingdom come, yet would it not make thee ready to run mad, to hear the trumpet sound, to see the dead arise, and thyself just now to go and appear before God, to reckon for all the deeds thou hast done in the body?","Nay, are not the very thoughts of it altogether displeasing to thee?","And if God's will should be done on earth as it is in heaven, must it not be thy ruin?","There is never a rebel in heaven against God, and if he should so deal on earth, must it not whirl thee down to hell?",And so of the rest of the petitions.,Ah!,"How sadly would even those men look, and with what terror would they walk up and down the world, if they did but know the lying and blaspheming that proceedeth out of their mouth, even in their most pretended sanctity?","The Lord awaken you, and teach you, poor souls, in all humility, to take heed that you be not rash and unadvised with your heart, and much more with your mouth!","When you appear before God, as the wise man saith, ""Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing,"" (Eccl 5:2); especially to call God Father, without some blessed experience when thou comest before God.",But I pass this.,Seventh.,"It must be a praying with the Spirit if it be accepted, because there is nothing but the Spirit that can lift up the soul or heart to God in prayer: ""The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the Lord"" (Prov 16:1).","That is, in every work for God, and especially in prayer, if the heart run with the tongue, it must be prepared by the Spirit of God.","Indeed the tongue is very apt, of itself, to run without either fear or wisdom: but when it is the answer of the heart, and that such a heart as is prepared by the Spirit of God, then it speaks so as God commands and doth desire.","They are mighty words of David, where he saith, that he lifteth his heart and his soul to God (Psa 25:1).","It is a great work for any man without the strength of the Spirit, and therefore I conceive that this is one of the great reasons why the Spirit of God is called a Spirit of supplications, (Zech 12:10), because it is that which helpeth the heart when it supplicates indeed to do it; and therefore saith Paul, ""Praying with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit"" (Eph 6:18).","And so in my text, ""I will pray with the Spirit.""","Prayer, without the heart be in it, is like a sound without life; and a heart, without it be lifted up of the Spirit, will never pray to God.",Eighth.,"As the heart must be lifted up by the Spirit, if it pray aright, so also it must be held up by the Spirit when it is up, if it continue to pray aright.","I do not know what, or how it is with others' hearts, whether they be lifted up by the Spirit of God, and so continued, or no: but this I am sure of, First, That it is impossible that all the prayer-books that men have made in the world, should lift up, or prepare the heart; that is the work of the great God himself.","And, in the second place, I am sure that they are as far from keeping it up, when it is up.","And indeed here is the life of prayer, to have the heart kept with God in the duty.",It was a great matter for Moses to keep his hands lifted up to God in prayer; but how much more then to keep the heart in it!,(Exo 17:12).,"The want of this is that which God complains of; that they draw nigh to him with their mouth, and honour him with their lips, but their hearts were far from him (Isa 29:13; Eze 33), but chiefly that they walk after the commandments and traditions of men, as the scope of Matthew 15:8, 9 doth testify.","And verily, may I but speak my own experience, and from that tell you the difficulty of praying to God as I ought, it is enough to make your poor, blind, carnal men to entertain strange thoughts of me.","For, as for my heart, when I go to pray, I find it so loth to go to God, and when it is with him, so loth to stay with him, that many times I am forced in my prayers, first to beg of God that he would take mine heart, and set it on himself in Christ, and when it is there, that he would keep it there.","Nay, many times I know not what to pray for, I am so blind, nor how to pray, I am so ignorant; only, blessed be grace, the Spirit helps our infirmities (Psa 86:11).",O!,"the starting-holes that the heart hath in the time of prayer; none knows how many bye-ways the heart hath, and back-lanes, to slip away from the presence of God.","How much pride also, if enabled with expressions.","How much hypocrisy, if before others.","And how little conscience is there made of prayer between God and the soul in secret, unless the Spirit of supplication be there to help?","When the Spirit gets into the heart, then there is prayer indeed, and not till then.",Ninth.,"The soul that doth rightly pray, it must be in and with the help and strength of the Spirit; because it is impossible that a man should express himself in prayer without it.","When I say, it is impossible for a man to express himself in prayer without it, I mean, that it is impossible that the heart, in a sincere and sensible affectionate way, should pour out itself before God, with those groans and sighs that come from a truly praying heart, without the assistance of the Spirit.","It is not the mouth that is the main thing to be looked at in prayer, but whether the heart is so full of affection and earnestness in prayer with God, that it is impossible to express their sense and desire; for then a man desires indeed, when his desires are so strong, many, and mighty, that all the words, tears, and groans that can come from the heart, cannot utter them: ""The Spirit--helpeth our infirmities,--and maketh intercession for us with [sighs and] groanings which cannot be uttered"" (Rom 8:26).",That is but poor prayer which is only discovered in so many words.,"A man that truly prays one prayer, shall after that never be able to express with his mouth or pen the unutterable desires, sense, affection, and longing that went to God in that prayer.","The best prayers have often more groans than words: and those words that it hath are but a lean and shallow representation of the heart, life, and spirit of that prayer.","You do not find any words of prayer, that we read of, come out of the mouth of Moses, when he was going out of Egypt, and was followed by Pharaoh, and yet he made heaven ring again with his cry (Exo 14:15).",But it was inexpressible and unsearchable groans and cryings of his soul in and with the Spirit.,"God is the God of spirits, and his eyes look further than at the outside of any duty whatsoever (Num 16:22).",I doubt this is but little thought on by the most of them that would be looked upon as a praying people (I Sam 16:7).,"The nearer a man comes in any work that God commands him to the doing of it according to his will, so much the more hard and difficult it is; and the reason is, because man, as man, is not able to do it.","But prayer, as aforesaid, is not only a duty, but one of the most eminent duties, and therefore so much the more difficult: therefore Paul knew what he said, when he said, ""I will pray with the Spirit.""",He knew well it was not what others writ or said that could make him a praying person; nothing less than the Spirit could do it.,Tenth.,"It must be with the Spirit, or else as there will be a failing in the act itself, so there will be a failing, yea, a fainting, in the prosecution of the work.","Prayer is an ordinance of God, that must continue with a soul so long as it is on this side glory.","But, as I said before, it is not possible for a man to get up his heart to God in prayer; so it is as difficult to keep it there, without the assistance of the Spirit.","And if so, then for a man to continue from time to time in prayer with God, it must of necessity be with the Spirit.","Christ tells us, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint (Luke 18:1).","And again tells us, that this is one definition of a hypocrite, that either he will not continue in prayer, or else if he do it, it will not be in the power, that is, in the spirit of prayer, but in the form, for a pretence only (Job 27:10; Matt 23:14).","It is the easiest thing of a hundred to fall from the power to the form, but it is the hardest thing of many to keep in the life, spirit, and power of any one duty, especially prayer; that is such a work, that a man without the help of the Spirit cannot so much as pray once, much less continue, without it, in a sweet praying frame, and in praying, so to pray as to have his prayers ascend into the ears of the Lord God of Sabaoth.","Jacob did not only begin, but held it: ""I will not let thee go, unless thou bless me"" (Gen 32).",So did the rest of the godly (Hosea 12:4).,But this could not be without the spirit of prayer.,It is through the Spirit that we have access to the Father (Eph 2:18).,"The same is a remarkable place in Jude, when he stirreth up the saints by the judgment of God upon the wicked to stand fast, and continue to hold out in the faith of the gospel, as one excellent means thereto, without which he knew they would never be able to do it.","Saith he, ""Building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost"" (Jude 20).","As if he had said, Brethren, as eternal life is laid up for the persons that hold out only, so you cannot hold out unless you continue praying in the Spirit.","The great cheat that the devil and antichrist delude the world withal, it is to make them continue in the form of any duty, the form of preaching, of hearing, or praying, &c. These are they that have ""a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; from such turn away"" (II Tim 3:5).","Here followeth the third thing; to wit, WHAT IT IS TO PRAY WITH THE SPIRIT, AND WITH THE UNDERSTANDING.",THIRD.,"And now to the next thing, what it is to pray with the Spirit, and to pray with the understanding also.","For the apostle puts a clear distinction between praying with the Spirit, and praying with the Spirit and understanding: therefore when he saith, ""he will pray with the Spirit,"" he adds, ""and I will pray with the understanding ALSO.""",This distinction was occasioned through the Corinthians not observing that it was their duty to do what they did to the edification of themselves and others too: whereas they did it for their own commendations.,"So I judge: for many of them having extraordinary gifts, as to speak with divers tongues, &c., therefore they were more for those mighty gifts than they were for the edifying of their brethren; which was the cause that Paul wrote this chapter to them, to let them understand, that though extraordinary gifts were excellent, yet to do what they did to the edification of the church was more excellent.","For, saith the apostle, ""if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding,"" and also the understanding of others, ""is unfruitful"" (I Cor 14:3, 4, 12, 19, 24, 25.",Read the scope of the whole chapter).,"Therefore, ""I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.""","It is expedient then that the understanding should be occupied in prayer, as well as the heart and mouth: ""I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.""","That which is done with understanding, is done more effectually, sensibly, and heartily, as I shall show farther anon, than that which is done without it; which made the apostle pray for the Colossians, that God would fill them ""with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding"" (Col 1:9).","And for the Ephesians, that God would give unto them ""the spirit of wisdom and revelation, in the knowledge of him"" (Eph 1:17).","And so for the Philippians, that God would make them abound ""in knowledge, and in all judgment"" (Phil 1:9).","A suitable understanding is good in everything a man undertakes, either civil or spiritual; and therefore it must be desired by all them that would be a praying people.","In my speaking to this, I shall show you what it is to pray with understanding.","Understanding is to be taken both for speaking in our mother-tongue, and also experimentally.","I pass the first, and treat only on the second.","For the making of right prayers, it is to be required that there should be a good or spiritual understanding in all them who pray to God.",First.,"To pray with understanding, is to pray as being instructed by the Spirit in the understanding of the want of those things which the soul is to pray for.","Though a man be in never so much need of pardon of sin, and deliverance from wrath to come, yet if he understand not this, he will either not desire them at all, or else be so cold and lukewarm in his desires after them, that God will even loathe his frame of spirit in asking for them.","Thus it was with the church of the Laodiceans, they wanted knowledge or spiritual understanding; they knew not that they were poor, wretched, blind, and naked.","The cause whereof made them, and all their services, so loathsome to Christ, that he threatens to spew them out of his mouth (Rev 3:16, 17).","Men without understanding may say the same words in prayer as others do; but if there be an understanding in the one, and none in the other, there is, O there is a mighty difference in speaking the very same words!","The one speaking from a spiritual understanding of those things that he in words desires, and the other words it only, and there is all.",Second.,Spiritual understanding espieth in the heart of God a readiness and willingness to give those things to the soul that it stands in need of.,David by this could guess at the very thoughts of God towards him (Psa 40:5).,"And thus it was with the woman of Canaan; she did by faith and a right understanding discern, beyond all the rough carriage of Christ, tenderness and willingness in his heart to save, which caused her to be vehement and earnest, yea, restless, until she did enjoy the mercy she stood in need of (Matt 15:22-28).","And understanding of the willingness that is in the heart of God to save sinners, there is nothing will press the soul more to seek after God, and to cry for pardon, than it.","If a man should see a pearl worth an hundred pounds lie in a ditch, yet if he understood not the value of it, he would lightly pass it by: but if he once get the knowledge of it, he would venture up to the neck for it.","So it is with souls concerning the things of God: if a man once get an understanding of the worth of them, then his heart, nay, the very strength of his soul, runs after them, and he will never leave crying till he have them.","The two blind men in the gospel, because they did certainly know that Jesus, who was going by them, was both able and willing to heal such infirmities as they were afflicted with: therefore they cried, and the more they were rebuked, the more they cried (Matt 20:29-31).",Third.,"The understanding being spiritually enlightened, hereby there is the way, as aforesaid, discovered, through which the soul should come unto God; which gives great encouragement unto it.","It is else with a poor soul, as with one who hath a work to do, and if it be not done, the danger is great; if it be done, so is the advantage.","But he knows not how to begin, nor how to proceed; and so, through discouragement, lets all alone, and runs the hazard.",Fourth.,The enlightened understanding sees largeness enough in the promises to encourage it to pray; which still adds to it strength to strength.,"As when men promise such and such things to all that will come for them, it is great encouragement to those that know what promises are made, to come and ask for them.",Fifth.,"The understanding being enlightened, way is made for the soul to come to God with suitable arguments, sometimes in a way of expostulation, as Jacob (Gen 32:9).","Sometimes in way of supplication, yet not in a verbal way only, but even from the heart there is forced by the Spirit, through the understanding, such effectual arguments as moveth the heart of God.","When Ephraim gets a right understanding of his own unseemly carriages towards the Lord, then he begins to bemoan himself (Jer 31:18-20).","And in bemoaning of himself, he used such arguments with the Lord, that it affects his heart, draws out forgiveness, and makes Ephraim pleasant in his eyes through Jesus Christ our Lord: ""I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus,"" saith God, ""Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised; as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke; turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God.","Surely after that I was turned, I repented, and after that I was instructed,"" or had a right understanding of myself, ""I smote upon my thigh, I was ashamed; yea, even confounded; because I did bear the reproach of my youth.""","These be Ephraim's complaints and bemoanings of himself; at which the Lord breaks forth into these heart-melting expressions, saying, ""Is Ephraim my dear son?",Is he a pleasant child?,"For since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still; therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.""","Thus, you see, that as it is required to pray with the Spirit, so it is to pray with the understanding also.","And to illustrate what hath been spoken by a similitude:--set the case, there should come two a-begging to your door; the one is a poor, lame, wounded, and almost starved creature, the other is a healthful lusty person; these two use the same words in their begging; the one saith he is almost starved, so doth the other: but yet the man that is indeed the poor, lame, or maimed person, he speaks with more sense, feeling, and understanding of the misery that is mentioned in their begging, than the other can do; and it is discovered more by his affectionate speaking, his bemoaning himself.","His pain and poverty make him speak more in a spirit of lamentation than the other, and he shall be pitied sooner than the other, by all those that have the least dram of natural affection or pity.",Just thus it is with God: there are some who out of custom and formality go and pray; there are others who go in the bitterness of their spirits: the one he prays out of bare notion and naked knowledge; the other hath his words forced from him by the anguish of his soul.,"Surely that is the man that God will look at, ""even to him that is poor,"" of an humble ""and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word"" (Isa 66:2).",Sixth.,"An understanding well enlightened is of admirable use also, both as to the matter and manner of prayer.","He that hath his understanding well exercised, to discern between good and evil, and in it placed a sense either of the misery of man, or the mercy of God; that soul hath no need of the writings of other men to teach him by forms of prayer.",For as he that feels the pain needs not to be taught to cry O!,"even so he that hath his understanding opened by the Spirit needs not so to be taught of other men's prayers, as that he cannot pray without them.","The present sense, feeling, and pressure that lieth upon his spirit, provokes him to groan out his request unto the Lord.","When David had the pains of hell catching hold on him, and the sorrows of hell compassing him about, he needs not a bishop in a surplice to teach him to say, ""O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul"" (Psa 116:3, 4).","Or to look into a book, to teach him in a form to pour out his heart before God.","It is the nature of the heart of sick men, in their pain and sickness, to vent itself for ease, by dolorous groans and complainings to them that stand by.","Thus it was with David, in Psalm 38:1-12.","And thus, blessed be the Lord, it is with them that are endued with the grace of God.",Seventh.,"It is necessary that there be an enlightened understanding, to the end that the soul be kept in a continuation of the duty of prayer.","The people of God are not ignorant how many wiles, tricks, and temptations the devil hath to make a poor soul, who is truly willing to have the Lord Jesus Christ, and that upon Christ's terms too; I say, to tempt that soul to be weary of seeking the face of God, and to think that God is not willing to have mercy on such a one as him.","Ay, saith Satan, thou mayest pray indeed, but thou shalt not prevail.","Thou seest thine heart is hard, cold, dull, and dread; thou dost not pray with the Spirit, thou dost not pray in good earnest, thy thoughts are running after other things, when thou pretendest to pray to God.","Away hypocrite, go no further, it is but in vain to strive any longer!","Here now, if the soul be not well informed in its understanding, it will presently cry out, ""the Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me"" (Isa 49:14).","Whereas the soul rightly informed and enlightened saith, Well, I will seek the Lord, and wait; I will not leave off, though the Lord keep silence, and speak not one word of comfort (Isa 40:27).","He loved Jacob dearly, and yet he made him wrestle before he had the blessing (Gen 32:25-27).",Seeming delays in God are no tokens of his displeasure; he may hide his face from his dearest saints (Isa 8:17).,"He loves to keep his people praying, and to find them ever knocking at the gate of heaven; it may be, says the soul, the Lord tries me, or he loves to hear me groan out my condition before him.","The woman of Canaan would not take seeming denials for real ones; she knew the Lord was gracious, and the Lord will avenge his people, though he bear long with them (Luke 18:1-6).","The Lord hath waited longer upon me than I have waited upon him; and thus it was with David, ""I waited patiently,"" saith he; that is, it was long before the Lord answered me, though at the last ""he inclined"" his ear ""unto me, and heard my cry"" (Psa 40:1).","And the most excellent remedy for this is, an understanding well informed and enlightened.","Alas, how many poor souls are there in the world, that truly fear the Lord, who, because they are not well informed in their understanding, are oft ready to give up all for lost, upon almost every trick and temptation of Satan!","The Lord pity them, and help them to ""pray with the Spirit, and with the understanding also.""","Much of mine own experience could I here discover; when I have been in my fits of agony of spirit, I have been strongly persuaded to leave off, and to seek the Lord no longer;10 but being made to understand what great sinners the Lord hath had mercy upon, and how large his promises were still to sinners; and that it was not the whole, but the sick, not the righteous, but the sinner, not the full, but the empty, that he extended his grace and mercy unto.","This made me, through the assistance of his Holy Spirit, to cleave to him, to hang upon him, and yet to cry, though for the present he made no answer; and the Lord help all his poor, tempted, and afflicted people to do the like, and to continue, though it be long, according to the saying of the prophet (Hab 2:3).","And to help them (to that end) to pray, not by the inventions of men, and their stinted forms, but ""with the Spirit, and with the understanding also.""",[Queries and Objections answered.],"And now to answer a query or two, and so to pass on to the next thing.",Query First.,But what would you have us poor creatures to do that cannot tell how to pray?,"The Lord knows I know not either how to pray, or what to pray for.",Answ.,Poor heart!,"thou canst not, thou complainest, pray.",Canst thou see thy misery?,Hath God showed thee that thou art by nature under the curse of his law?,"If so, do not mistake, I know thou dost groan and that most bitterly.","I am persuaded thou canst scarcely be found doing any thing in thy calling, but prayer breaketh from thy heart.",Have not thy groans gone up to heaven from every corner of thy house?,(Rom 8:26).,"I know it is thus;

and were notably painted out by Ahab's prophets, and also Nebuchadnezzar's wise men, who, though they pretended great devotion, yet their lusts and their bellies were the great things aimed at by them in all their pieces of devotion.",(2.),"Them also that seek repute and applause for their eloquent terms, and seek more to tickle the ears and heads of their hearers than anything else.","These be they that pray to be heard of men, and have all their reward already (Matt 6:5).","These persons are discovered thus, (a.)",They eye only their auditory in their expressions.,(b.),They look for commendation when they have done.,(c.) Their hearts either rise or fall according to their praise or enlargement.,"(d.) The length of their prayer pleaseth them; and that it might be long, they will vainly repeat things over and over (Matt 6:7).","They study for enlargements, but look not from what heart they come; they look for returns, but it is the windy applause of men.","And therefore they love not to be in their chamber, but among company: and if at any time conscience thrusts them into their closet, yet hypocrisy will cause them to be heard in the streets; and when their mouths have done going their prayers are ended; for they wait not to hearken what the Lord will say (Psa 85:8).",3.,"A third sort of prayer that will not be accepted of God, it is, when either they pray for wrong things, or if for right things, yet that the thing prayed for might be spent upon their lusts, and laid out to wrong ends.","Some have not, because they ask not, saith James, and others ask and have not, because they ask amiss, that they may consume it on their lusts (James 4: 2-4).",Ends contrary to God's will is a great argument with God to frustrate the petitions presented before him.,"Hence it is that so many pray for this and that, and yet receive it not.",God answers them only with silence; they have their words for their labour; and that is all.,Object.,"But God hears some persons, though their hearts be not right with him, as he did Israel, in giving quails, though they spent them upon their lusts (Psa 106:14).",Answ.,"If he doth, it is in judgment, not in mercy.","He gave them their desire indeed, but they had better have been without it, for he ""sent leanness into their soul"" (Psa 106:15).",Woe be to that man that God answereth thus.,4.,"Another sort of prayers there are that are not answered; and those are such as are made by men, and presented to God in their own persons only, without their appearing in the Lord Jesus.","For though God hath appointed prayer, and promised to hear the prayer of the creature, yet not the prayer of any creature that comes not in Christ.","""If ye shall ask anything in my name.""","And whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (Col 3:17).","""If ye shall ask anything in my name,"" &c., (John 14:13, 14), though you be never so devout, zealous, earnest and constant in prayer, yet it is in Christ only that you must be heard and accepted.","But, alas!","the most of men know not what it is to come to him in the name of the Lord Jesus, which is the reason they either live wicked, pray wicked, and also die wicked.","Or else, that they attain to nothing else but what a mere natural man may attain unto, as to be exact in word and deed betwixt man and man, and only with the righteousness of the law to appear before God.",5.,"The last thing that hindereth prayer is, the form of it without the power.","It is an easy thing for men to be very hot for such things as forms of prayer, as they are written in a book; but yet they are altogether forgetful to inquire with themselves, whether they have the spirit and power of prayer.","These men are like a painted man, and their prayers like a false voice.","They in person appear as hypocrites, and their prayers are an abomination (Prov 28:9).",When they say they have been pouring out their souls to God he saith they have been howling like dogs (Hosea 7:14).,"When therefore thou intendest, or art minded to pray to the Lord of heaven and earth, consider these following particulars.",1.,Consider seriously what thou wantest.,"Do not, as many who in their words only beat the air, and ask for such things as indeed they do not desire, nor see that they stand in need thereof.",2.,"When thou seest what thou wantest, keep to that, and take heed thou pray sensibly.",Object.,"But I have a sense of nothing; then, by your argument, I must not pray at all.",Answ.,1.,"If thou findest thyself senseless in some sad measure, yet thou canst not complain of that senselessness, but by being sensible there is a sense of senselessness.","According to thy sense, then, that thou hast of the need of anything, so pray; (Luke 8:9), and if thou art sensible of thy senselessness, pray the Lord to make thee sensible of whatever thou findest thine heart senseless of.",This was the usual practice of the holy men of God.,"""Lord, make me to know mine end,"" saith David (Psa 39:4).","""Lord, open to us this parable,"" said the disciples (Luke 8:9).","And to this is annexed the promise, ""Call unto me and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not,"" that thou art not sensible of (Jer 33:3).","But, Answ.",2.,Take heed that thy heart go to God as well as thy mouth.,Let not thy mouth go any further than thou strivest to draw thine heart along with it.,"David would lift his heart and soul to the Lord; and good reason; for so far as a man's mouth goeth along without his heart, so far it is but lip-labour only; and though God calls for, and accepteth the calves of the lips, yet the lips without the heart argueth, not only senselessness, but our being without sense of our senselessness; and therefore if thou hast a mind to enlarge in prayer before God, see that it be with thy heart.",Answ.,3.,"Take heed of affecting expressions, and so to please thyself with the use of them, that thou forget not the life of prayer.",I shall conclude this use with a caution or two.,Caution 1.,"And the first is, take heed thou do not throw off prayer, through sudden persuasions that thou hast not the Spirit, neither prayest thereby.","It is the great work of the devil to do his best, or rather worst, against the best prayers.","He will flatter your false dissembling hypocrites, and feed them with a thousand fancies of well-doing, when their very duties of prayer, and all other, stink in the nostrils of God, when he stands at a poor Joshua's hand to resist him, that is, to persuade him, that neither his person nor performances are accepted of God (Isa 65:5; Zech 3:1).","Take heed, therefore, of such false conclusions and groundless discouragements; and though such persuasions do come in upon thy spirit, be so far from being discouraged by them, that thou use them to put thee upon further sincerity and restlessness of spirit, in thy approaching to God.",Caution 2.,"As such sudden temptations should not stop thee from prayer, and pouring out thy soul to God; so neither should thine own heart's corruptions hinder thee.",(Let not thy corruptions stop thy prayers).,"It may be thou mayest find in thee all those things before mentioned, and that they will be endeavouring to put forth themselves in thy praying to him.","Thy business then is to judge them, to pray against them, and to lay thyself so much the more at the foot of God, in a sense of thy own vileness, and rather make an argument from thy vileness and corruption of heart, to plead with God for justifying and sanctifying grace, than an argument of discouragement and despair.",David went this way.,"""O Lord,"" saith he, ""pardon mine iniquity, for it is great"" (Psa 25:11).",USE Second.,A word of encouragement.,"And therefore, secondly, to speak a word by way of encouragement, to the poor, tempted, and cast down soul, to pray to God through Christ.","Though all prayer that is accepted of God in reference to eternal life must be in the Spirit--for that only maketh intercession for us according to the will of God, (Rom 8:27)--yet because many poor souls may have the Holy Spirit working on them, and stirring of them to groan unto the Lord for mercy, though through unbelief they do not, nor, for the present, cannot believe that they are the people of God, such as he delights in; yet forasmuch as the truth of grace may be in them, therefore I shall, to encourage them, lay down further these few particulars.",1.,That scripture in Luke 11:8 is very encouraging to any poor soul that doth hunger after Christ Jesus.,"In verses 5-7, he speaketh a parable of a man that went to his friend to borrow three loaves, who, because he was in bed, denied him; yet for his importunity-sake, he did arise and give him, clearly signifying that though poor souls, through the weakness of their faith, cannot see that they are the friends of God, yet they should never leave asking, seeking, and knocking at God's door for mercy.","Mark, saith Christ, ""I say unto you, though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend; yet because of his importunity,"" or restless desires, ""he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.""",Poor heart!,"thou criest out that God will not regard thee, thou dost not find that thou art a friend to him, but rather an enemy in thine heart by wicked works (Col 1:21).","And thou art as though thou didst hear the Lord saying to thee, Trouble me not, I cannot give unto thee, as he in the parable; yet I say, continue knocking, crying, moaning, and bewailing thyself.","I tell thee, ""though he will not rise and give thee, because thou art his friend; yet, because of thy importunity, he will arise and give thee as many as thou needest.""","The same in effect you have discovered, Luke 18, in the parable of the unjust judge and the poor widow; her importunity prevailed with him.","And verily, mine own experience tells me, that there is nothing that doth more prevail with God than importunity.",Is it not so with you in respect of your beggars that come to your door?,"Though you have no heart to give them anything at their first asking, yet if they follow you, bemoaning themselves, and will take no nay without an alms, you will give them; for their continual begging overcometh you.","Are there bowels in you that are wicked, and will they be wrought upon by an importuning beggar?",Go thou and do the like.,"It is a prevailing motive, and that by good experience, he will arise and give thee as many as thou needest (Luke 11:8).",2.,"Another encouragement for a poor trembling convinced soul is to consider the place, throne, or seat, on which the great God hath placed himself to hear the petitions and prayers of poor creatures; and that is a ""throne of grace"" (Heb 4:16).","""The mercy-seat"" (Exo 25:22).","Which signifieth that in the days of the gospel God hath taken up his seat, his abiding-place, in mercy and forgiveness; and from thence he doth intend to hear the sinner, and to commune with him, as he saith (Exo 25:22),--speaking before of the mercy-seat--""And there I will meet with thee,"" mark, it is upon the mercy-seat: ""There I will meet with thee, and"" there ""I will commune with thee, from above the mercy-seat.""",Poor souls!,"They are very apt to entertain strange thoughts of God, and his carriage towards them: and suddenly to conclude that God will have no regard unto them, when yet he is upon the mercy-seat, and hath taken up his place on purpose there, to the end he may hear and regard the prayers of poor creatures.","If he had said, I will commune with thee from my throne of judgment, then indeed you might have trembled and fled from the face of the great and glorious Majesty.","But when he saith he will hear and commune with souls upon the throne of grace, or from the mercy-seat, this should encourage thee, and cause thee to hope, nay, to ""come boldly unto the throne of grace, that thou mayest obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need"" (Heb 4:16).",3.,"There is yet another encouragement to continue in prayer with God: and that is this: As there is a mercy-seat, from whence God is willing to commune with poor sinners; so there is also by his mercy-seat, Jesus Christ, who continually besprinkleth it with his blood.","Hence it is called ""the blood of sprinkling"" (Heb 12:24).","When the high-priest under the law was to go into the holiest, where the mercy-seat was, he might not go in ""without blood"" (Heb 9:7).",Why so?,"Because, though God was upon the mercy-seat, yet he was perfectly just as well as merciful.","Now the blood was to stop justice from running out upon the persons concerned in the intercession of the high-priest, as in Leviticus 16:13-17, to signify that all thine unworthiness that thou fearest should not hinder thee from coming to God in Christ for mercy.","Thou criest out that thou art vile, and therefore God will not regard thy prayers; it is true, if thou delight in thy vileness, and come to God out of a mere pretence.","But if from a sense of thy vileness thou do pour out thy heart to God, desiring to be saved from the guilt, and cleansed from the filth, with all thy heart; fear not, thy vileness will not cause the Lord to stop his ear from hearing of thee.","The value of the blood of Christ which is sprinkled upon the mercy-seat stops the course of justice, and opens a floodgate for the mercy of the Lord to be extended unto thee.","Thou hast therefore, as aforesaid, ""boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,"" that hath made ""a new and living way"" for thee, thou shalt not die (Heb 10:19, 20).","Besides, Jesus is there, not only to sprinkle the mercy-seat with his blood, but he speaks, and his blood speaks; he hath audience, and his blood hath audience; insomuch that God saith, when he doth but see the blood, he ""will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you,"" &c., (Exo 12:13).",I shall not detain you any longer.,"Be sober and humble; go to the Father in the name of the Son, and tell him your case, in the assistance of the Spirit, and you will then feel the benefit of praying with the Spirit and with the understanding also.",USE Third.,A word of reproof.,1.,This speaks sadly to you who never pray at all.,"""I will pray,"" saith the apostle, and so saith the heart of them that are Christians.",Thou then art not a Christian that art not a praying person.,The promise is that every one that is righteous shall pray (Psa 32:6).,Thou then art a wicked wretch that prayest not.,Jacob got the name of Israel by wrestling with God (Gen 32).,And all his children bare that name with him (Gal 6:16).,"But the people that forget prayer, that call not on the name of the Lord, they have prayer made for them, but it is such as this, ""Pour out thy fury upon the heathen,"" O Lord, ""and upon the families that call not on thy name"" (Jer 10:25).","How likest thou this, O thou that art so far off from pouring out thine heart before God, that thou goest to bed like a dog, and risest like a hog, or a sot, and forgettest to call upon God?","What wilt thou do when thou shalt be damned in hell, because thou couldst not find in thine heart to ask for heaven?","Who will grieve for thy sorrow, that didst not count mercy worth asking for?","I tell thee, the ravens, the dogs, &c., shall rise up in judgment against thee, for they will, according to their kind, make signs, and a noise for something to refresh them when they want it; but thou hast not the heart to ask for heaven, though thou must eternally perish in hell, if thou hast it not.",2.,"This rebukes you that make it your business to slight, mock at, and undervalue the Spirit, and praying by that.","What will you do, when God shall come to reckon for these things?","You count it high treason to speak but a word against the king, nay, you tremble at the thought of it; and yet in the meantime you will blaspheme the Spirit of the Lord.","Is God indeed to be dallied with, and will the end be pleasant unto you?","Did God send his Holy Spirit into the hearts of his people, to that end that you should taunt at it?",Is this to serve God?,And doth this demonstrate the reformation of your church?,"Nay, is it not the mark of implacable reprobates?",O fearful!,"Can you not be content to be damned for your sins against the law, but you must sin against the Holy Ghost?","Must the holy, harmless, and undefiled Spirit of grace, the nature of God, the promise of Christ, the Comforter of his children, that without which no man can do any service acceptable to the Father--must this, I say, be the burthen of your song, to taunt, deride, and mock at?","If God sent Korah and his company headlong to hell for speaking against Moses and Aaron, do you that mock at the Spirit of Christ think to escape unpunished?",(Num 16; Heb 10:29).,Did you never read what God did to Ananias and Sapphira for telling but one lie against it?,(Acts 5:1-8).,Also to Simon Magus for but undervaluing of it?,(Acts 8:18-22).,"And will thy sin be a virtue, or go unrewarded with vengeance, that makest it thy business to rage against, and oppose its office, service, and help, that it giveth unto the children of God?","It is a fearful thing to do despite unto the Spirit of grace (Compare Matt 12:31, with Mark 3:28-30).",3.,"As this is the doom of those who do openly blaspheme the Holy Ghost, in a way of disdain and reproach to its office and service: so also it is sad for you, who resist the Spirit of prayer, by a form of man's inventing.","A very juggle of the devil, that the traditions of men should be of better esteem, and more to be owned than the Spirit of prayer.","What is this less than that accursed abomination of Jeroboam, which kept many from going to Jerusalem, the place and way of God's appointment to worship; and by that means brought such displeasure from God upon them, as to this day is not appeased?",(I Kings 12:26-33).,One would think that God's judgments of old upon the hypocrites of that day should make them that have heard of such things take heed and fear to do so.,"Yet the doctors of our day are so far from taking of warning by the punishment of others, that they do most desperately rush into the same transgression, viz., to set up an institution of man, neither commanded nor commended of God; and whosoever will not obey herein, they must be driven either out of the land or the world.",Hath God required these things at your hands?,"If he hath, show us where?","If not, as I am sure he hath not, then what cursed presumption is it in any pope, bishop, or other, to command that in the worship of God which he hath not required?","Nay further, it is not that part only of the form, which is several texts of Scripture that we are commanded to say, but even all must be confessed as the divine worship of God, notwithstanding those absurdities contained therein, which because they are at large discovered by others, I omit the rehearsal of them.","Again, though a man be willing to live never so peaceably, yet because he cannot, for conscience sake, own that for one of the most eminent parts of God's worship, which he never commanded, therefore must that man be looked upon as factious, seditious, erroneous, heretical--a disparagement to the church, a seducer of the people, and what not?","Lord, what will be the fruit of these things, when for the doctrine of God there is imposed, that is, more than taught, the traditions of men?","Thus is the Spirit of prayer disowned, and the form imposed; the Spirit debased, and the form extolled; they that pray with the Spirit, though never so humble and holy, counted fanatics; and they that pray with the form, though with that only, counted the virtuous!","And how will the favorers of such a practice answer that Scripture, which commandeth that the church should turn away from such as have ""a form of godliness, and deny the power thereof""?",(II Tim 3:5).,"And if I should say that men that do these things aforesaid, do advance a form of prayer of other men's making, above the spirit of prayer, it would not take long time to prove it.","For he that advanceth the book of Common Prayer above the Spirit of prayer, he doth advance a form of men's making above it.","But this do all those who banish, or desire to banish, them that pray with the Spirit of prayer; while they hug and embrace them that pray by that form only, and that because they do it.","Therefore they love and advance the form of their own or others' inventing, before the Spirit of prayer, which is God's special and gracious appointment.","If you desire the clearing of the minor, look into the jails in England, and into the alehouses of the same; and I trow you will find those that plead for the Spirit of prayer in the jail, and them that look after the form of men's inventions only in the alehouse.","It is evident also by the silencing of God's dear ministers, though never so powerfully enabled by the Spirit of prayer, if they in conscience cannot admit of that form of Common Prayer.","If this be not an exalting the Common Prayer Book above either praying by the Spirit, or preaching the Word, I have taken my mark amiss.",It is not pleasant for me to dwell on this.,"The Lord in mercy turn the hearts of the people to seek more after the Spirit of prayer;

and, at the same time, the infinitely holy one, the supreme judge and just rewarder or punisher of all creatures.","How shall we, who are impure and unclean by nature and by practice, draw near unto him who is so infinitely holy?","Others of our race who were equally guilty have held acceptable converse with God, and received special marks of his favour.","We all know that a talented man, high in office, retired at certain times for prayer; this gave offence, and a law was made, by which prayer to God was interdicted for thirty days.","He refused obedience to a human law which interfered with the divine authority, and for this he was cast into the den of lions; but they hurt him not, although they devoured his persecutors.","When a beloved minister was seized and imprisoned for his love to Christ, the church held a prayer meeting on his account, and while they were praying God sent his angel to the prison.","In vain four quaternions of soldiers kept guard, two of them in the prisoner's cell, while the servant of Christ, who was loaded with chains and doomed to an ignominious death, slept sweetly between the armed men.","The angel awakes him, his chains fall off, no noise can awake his guard, the prison doors open, and he was restored to his beloved charge.","They were yet imploring his deliverance, when he stood in their midst to tell the wondrous miracle, wrought in answer to their prayer.","Again, two of their much-loved ministers were seized and beaten, and cast into jail, their feet being made fast in the stocks.","In the dark hour of midnight they prayed and praised God, when an earthquake was sent, which shook the prison and threw open its doors, and the jailor, with his house, became converts to the faith.",Millions of instances might have been recorded of prayer heard and answered.,"The child Samuel, and also Ishmael.",The Magdalene.,The thief on the cross.,"Ananias, who was directed to relieve the stricken persecutor Saul, for 'behold he prayeth.'",But innumerable prayers have been read and offered up which have not been answered.,"What then is the acceptable form, and what the appointed medium consecrated for our access to God, by which prayer is sanctified and accepted?","If ye love me, saith the Saviour, keep my commandments, and whatsoever ye shall ask IN MY NAME that will I do.","A sense of our want and unworthiness leads us to God in that new and living way consecrated by Christ though the veil, that is to say, his flesh (Heb 10:20).","By that way we can 'come boldly,' because it is 'a throne of grace,' and there and there only we can 'obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.'",Wondrous throne!,"Blessed encouragement to the poor pilgrim, traversing the desert surrounded by enemies, his own heart by nature being one of the most formidable of them!","It is of great importance to all, and especially to the young, to attain correct definite ideas of religious truths.","Bunyan had remarkably clear views, arising from his strong feelings and the rugged path by which he was led to Christ.",His definition of the difference between grace and mercy is very striking: 'Mercy signifies pitifulness to objects in a miserable condition.,"Grace acts as a free agent, not wrought upon by our misery but of God's own princely mind.'","Christ is the throne of grace--in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead, and yet he was found in fashion as a man, he took on him the seed of Abraham, and was made like unto his brethren, and offered himself up as the sacrifice for sin.",Thus he is the throne of grace on the mercy-seat covering the law.,Here he is an object of worship to the angels on the right hand of God.,"In him the uncreated glory, the dazzling effulgence of God, is so veiled in his glorified body, that man, poor sinful man, can lift up his eyes to behold the place where God's honour most richly dwelleth, and find acceptance and grace to help in every time of need.","Take heed, sinner, this is your only access to heaven.","The mercy-seat and throne of grace is God's resting-place; the throne which governs his church, and which eventually will govern all nations.","This throne, invisible to mortal eyes, is present at all times and in all places.","After the saints have been supplied with all needful grace in this world, their glorified spirits will see the great white throne, and hear the voice proceeding from it, saying, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you; while from that throne the direful thunderbolts will be hurled upon the despisers of divine grace, and they will hurry into irretrievable misery.","The safety of the Christian entirely depends upon his being found 'looking unto Jesus': his glorified human body is the throne of grace--the source of all blessedness to his worshippers--the gate of heaven--the way, the truth and the life.","Yes, proud nature, HE who was the babe at Bethlehem, the poor carpenter's son, who, notwithstanding his miracles of wisdom, power, and mercy, was despised and rejected of men, HIM hath God exalted to be a prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and the remission of sins, the only medium of access to heaven.",Before him every knee shall bow.,Wonders of grace to God belong.,"'Busy thyself, fellow christian, about this blessed office of Christ.","It is full of good, it is full of sweet, it is full of heaven, it is full of relief and succour for the tempted and dejected;

Wherefore, in order to our beneficial reading of this epistle, the Spirit of God calls upon us, first, most seriously to consider what an one this excellent person is: 'Wherefore, holy brethren,' saith he, you that are 'partakers of the heavenly calling,' consequently you that are related to and that are concerned in the undertaking of this holy one, 'consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus' (Heb 3:1).",Consider how great and how fit this man is for so holy and glorious a calling.,"He being so high, as to be far above all heavens; so great, as to be the Son of, and God equal with the Father.","Consider him also as to his humanity, how that he is really flesh of our flesh; sinlessly so, sympathisingly so, so in all the compassions of a man; he is touched with, compassioneth, pitieth, loveth, succoureth us, and feeleth our infirmities, and maketh our case his own.","Nay, he again, from the consideration of his greatness and love, puts us upon a confident reliance on his undertaking, and also presseth us to a bold approach of that throne of grace where he continually abideth in the execution of his office: 'Seeing then,' saith he, 'that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.","For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities: but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.",Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace' (Heb 3:14-16).,"In the words we have, First, An exhortation; [and] Second, An implication that we shall reap a worthy benefit, if we truly put the exhortation into practice.",The exhortation is that we shall come boldly to the throne of grace: 'Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace.',In all we have an intimation of five things.,"FIRST, That God hath more thrones than one; else the throne of grace need not to be specified by name.",'Let us come unto the throne of grace.',"SECOND, That the godly can distinguish one throne from another.","For the throne here is not set forth by where or what signs it should be known; it is only propounded to us by its name, and so left for saints to make their approach unto it: 'Let us come unto the throne of grace.'","THIRD, The third thing is, the persons intended by this exhortation, 'Let us therefore come.'",Us: What us?,or who are they that by this exhortation are called upon to come?,'Let us.',"FOURTH, The manner of the coming of these persons to this throne of grace; and that is through the veil, boldly, confidently: 'Let us come boldly unto the throne of grace.'","FIFTH, the motive to this exhortation; and that is twofold, First, Because we have so great an high priest, one that cannot but be touched with the feeling of our infirmities: 'Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace.'","And, second, because we are sure to speed: 'That we may obtain mercy, and find grace,' &c. I shall, as God shall help me, handle these things in order.",[THAT GOD HATH MORE THRONES THAN ONE.],FIRST.,"For the first, That God hath more thrones than one.","He hath a throne in heaven, and a throne on earth: 'The Lord's throne is in heaven,' and 'they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord' (Psa 11:4; Jer 3:17).",He ruleth over the angels; he ruleth in his church.,"'He ruleth in Jacob, unto the ends of the earth' (Psa 59:13).","Yea, he has a throne and seat of majesty among the princes and great ones of the world.",He ruleth or 'judgeth among the gods' (Psa 82:1).,"There is a throne for him as a Father, and a throne for Christ as a giver of reward to all faithful and overcoming Christians: 'To him that overcometh, will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne' (Rev 3:21).","There is also to be a throne of judgment, on which God by Christ, at the great and notable day, shall sit to give to the whole world, their last or final sentence; from which, no, not, not by any means, they shall never be released.","This throne is made mention of in the New Testament, and is called by Christ 'the throne of his glory,' and 'a great white throne' (Matt 25:31; Rev 20:11).","And his presence, when he sits upon this throne, will be so terrible, that nothing shall be able to abide it that is not reconciled to God by him before.","Wherefore it is not amiss that I give you this hint, because it may tend to inform unwary Christians, when they go to God, that they address not themselves to him at rovers, or at random; but that when they come to him for benefits, they direct their prayer to the throne of grace, or to God as considered on a throne of grace.","[1] For he is not to be found a God merciful and gracious, but as he is on the throne of grace.","This is his holy place, out of which he is terrible to the sons of men, and cannot be gracious unto them.","For as when he shall sit at the last day upon his throne of judgment, he will neither be moved with the tears of misery of the world to do any thing for them, that in the least will have a tendency to a relaxation of the least part of their sorrow; so now let men take him where they will, or consider him as they list, he gives no grace, no special grace, but as considered on the throne of grace: wherefore they that will pray, and speed, they must come to a throne of grace: to a God that sitteth on a throne of grace: 'Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain,' &c. The unbeliever, the erroneous and superstitious, consider not this: wherefore they speak to God as their fancies lead them, not as the word directs them, and therefore obtain nothing.",Ask the carnal man to whom he prays?,he will say to God.,Ask him where this God is?,he will say in heaven.,"But ask him how, or under what notion he is to be considered there?","and he will give a few generals, but cannot direct his soul unto him as he is upon a throne of grace, as the apostle here biddeth, saying, 'Let us come boldly unto the throne of grace.'","Wherefore they come and go, or rather go and come to no advantage at all: they find nothing but their labour or words for their pains.","For the right considering of God when I go unto him, and how or where I may find him gracious and merciful, is all in all; and mercy and grace is then obtained when we come to him as sitting upon a throne of grace.",[THE GODLY CAN DISTINGUISH ONE THRONE FROM ANOTHER.],SECOND.,"We will therefore come to the second thing, to wit, that the godly can distinguish one thing from another.","And the reason why I so conclude, is, as I said, because the throne here is not set forth unto us here, by where or what signs it should be known; it is only propounded to us by its name, a throne of grace, and so left for saints to make their approach thereto: 'Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace.'","We will therefore take this conclusion into two parts, and consider it under this double position.","FIRST, That there is a throne of grace.","SECOND, That it is the privilege of the godly to distinguish from all other thrones whatever this throne of grace.","FIRST, There is a throne of grace.","This must be true, because the text saith it;[2] also it is that of which the mercy-seat, so often made mention of in the Old Testament, was a type, shadow, or figure; nor is the terms of seat and throne of any strength to make this supposition void.",For it is common for the antitype to be put forth in words unto us more glorious than is the figure or shadow of that thing.,"And the reason is, for that the heavenly things themselves are far more excellent than the shadow by which they are represented.","What is a sheep, a bull, an ox, or calf, to Christ, or their blood to the blood of Christ?","What is Jerusalem that stood in Canaan, to that new Jerusalem that shall come down from heaven?","or the tabernacle made with corruptible things, to the body of Christ, or heaven itself?","No marvel then, if they be set forth unto us by words of an inferior rank; the most full and aptest being reserved to set out the highest things withal.","Before I proceed to give you a more particular description of this throne of grace, as also how it may be know, I will a little touch upon the terms themselves, and show briefly what must be implied by them.",[Import of the term grace.],"First, By this word grace, we are to understand God's free, sovereign, good pleasure, whereby he acteth in Christ towards his people.","Grace and mercy therefore are terms that have their distinct significations; mercy signifies pitifulness, or a running over of infinite bowels to objects in a miserable and helpless condition.","But grace signifies that God still acts in this as a free agent, not being wrought upon by the misery of the creature, as a procuring cause; but of his own princely mind.","Were there no objects of pity among those that in the old world perished by the flood, or that in Sodom were burned with fire from heaven?","doubtless, according to our apprehension, there were many: but Noah, and he only, found grace in God's eyes; not because that of himself he was better than the rest, but God acted as a gracious prince towards him, and let him share in mercy of his own sovereign will and pleasure.",But this at first was not so fully made manifest as it was afterwards.,"Wherefore the propitiatory was not called, as here, a throne of grace, but a mercy-seat, albeit there was great glory in these terms also; for, by mercy-seat was showed, not only that God had compassion for men, but that also to be good was as his continual resting-place, whither he would at length retire, and where he would sit down and abide, whatever terrible or troublesome work for his church was on the wheel[3] at present.","For a seat is a place of rest, yea, is prepared for that end; and in that here mercy is called that seat, it is to show, as I said, that whatever work is on the wheel in the world, let it be never so dreadful and amazing, yet to God's church it shall end in mercy, for that is God's resting-place.","Wherefore after God had so severely threatened and punished his church under the name of a whorish woman, as you may read in the prophet Ezekiel, he saith, 'So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee; and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.'","And again, speaking of the same people and of the same punishments, he saith, 'Nevertheless, I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.'","And again, 'I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; that thou mayest remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God' (Eze 16:42,60-63).","These, with many more places, show that mercy is God's place of rest, and thither he will retire at last, and from thence will bless his church, his people.","But yet these terms, a throne, the throne of grace, doth more exceed in glory: not only because the word grace shows that God, by all that he doth towards us in saving and forgiving, acts freely as the highest Lord, and of his own good-will and pleasure, but also for that he now saith, that his grace is become a king, a throne of grace.","A throne is not only a seat for rest, but a place of dignity and authority.",This is known to all.,"Wherefore by this word, a throne, or the throne of grace, is intimated, that God ruleth and governeth by his grace.","And this he can justly do: 'Grace reigns through righteousness, unto eternal life,[4] through Jesus Christ out Lord' (Rom 5:21).","So then, in that here is mention made of a throne of grace, it showeth that sin, and Satan, and death, and hell, must needs be subdued.","For these last mentioned are but weakness and destruction; but grace is life, and the absolute sovereign over all these to the ruling of them utterly down.",A throne of grace!,"But this then God plainly declareth, that he is resolved this way to rule, and that he pointeth at sin as his deadly foe: and if so, then, 'where sin aboundeth, grace must much more abound' (Rom 5:20).","[5] For it is the wisdom and discretion of all that rule, to fortify themselves against them that rebel against them what they can.","Wherefore he saith again, 'Sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace' (Rom 6:14).","Sin seeks for the dominion, and grace seeks for the dominion; but sin shall not rule, because it has no throne in the church among the godly.",Grace is king.,"Grace has the throne, and the people of God are not under the dominion of sin, but of the grace of God, the which they are here implicitly bid to acknowledge, in that they are bid to come boldly to it for help: 'That we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help; to help in time of need.'","For as from the hand and power of the king comes help and succour to the subject, when assaulted by an enemy; so from the throne of grace, or from grace as it reigns, comes the help and health of God's people.","Hence it is said again, 'A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary' (Jer 17:12).","Here then the saints take shelter from the roaring of the devil, from the raging of their lusts, and from the fury of the wicked.","That also is a very notable place, 'He will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea' (Micah 7:19).","He speaks here of God as solacing himself in mercy, and as delighting of himself in the salvation of his people, and that without comparison: 'Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?","he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy' (Micah 7:18).","Thus is mercy and grace got into the throne, reigns, and will assuredly conquer all; yea, will conquer, and that with a shout.",'Mercy rejoiceth against judgment' (James 2:13).,"Yea, glorieth when it getteth the victory of sin, and subdueth the sinner unto God and to his own salvation, as is yet more fully showed in the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15).","But this, briefly to show you something of the nature of the terms, and what must necessarily be implied thereby.",[What is to be inferred from the term 'throne of grace.'],Second.,We will in the next place show what is to be inferred from hence.,"And, 1.","To be sure this is inferred, that converted men are not every way, or in every sense, free from the being of sin.","For, were they, they need not betake themselves to a throne of grace for help; when it saith there is grace in God, it inferreth, that there is sin in the godly; and when it saith, grace reigns, as upon a throne, it implies, that sin would ascend the throne, would reign, and would have the dominion over the children of God.","This also is manifest, when he saith, 'Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof' (Rom 7:12).","And the only way to prevent it is to apply ourselves, as by the text we are directed, to the throne of grace for help against it.",2.,"The text implies, that at certain times the most godly man in the world may be hard put to it by the sin that dwelleth in him; yea, so hard put to it, as that there can be no ways to save himself from a fall, but by imploring heaven and the throne of grace for help.","This is called the needy time, the time when the wayfaring man that knocked at David's door shall knock at ours (2 Sam 12); or when we are got into the sieve into which Satan did get Peter (Luke 22:31); or when those fists are about our ears that were about Paul's; and when that thorn pricks us that Paul said was in his flesh (2 Cor 12:7,8).","But why, or how comes it to pass, that the godly are so hard put to it at these times, but because there is in them, that is, in their flesh, no good thing, but consequently all aptness to close in with the devil and his suggestions, to the overthrow of the soul?","But now here we are presented with a throne of grace, unto which, as presented with a throne of grace, unto which, as David says, we must 'continually resort'; and that is the way to obtain relief, and to find help in time of need (Psa 71:3).",3.,"As Christians are sometimes in imminent dangers of falling, so sometimes it is so, that they are fallen, are down, down dreadfully, and can by no means lift up themselves.",And this happeneth unto them because they have been remiss as to the conscionable performance of what by this exhortation they are enjoined to.,"They have not been constant supplicants at this throne for preserving grace; for had they, they should, as the text suggests, most certainly have kept from such a fall; help should have been granted them in their needful time.","But that is it, of which such are guilty, which is written in the prophet Isaiah, 'But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel' (Isa 43:22).","Therefore thou art profaned, therefore thou art given to reproaches (Isa 43:28).","Now, as they which are falling are kept from coming down by coming to this throne of grace, so those that are fallen must rise by the sceptre of love extended to them from thence.","Men may fall by sin, but cannot raise up themselves without the help of grace.","Wherefore, it is worthy of our inquiry after a more thorough knowledge of this throne of grace, whence, as we may well perceive, our help comes, and by what comes from thence we are made to stand.","I therefore come now to a more particular description of this throne of grace; and to show how the godly know, or may know it, from other thrones of God.",[What this throne of grace is.],"First, then, this throne of grace is the humanity, or heart and soul of Jesus Christ, in which God sits and resteth for ever in love towards them that believe in him.","Forasmuch as Christ did, by the body of his flesh, when here, reconcile them unto the Father.","'The key of the house of David,' saith God, 'will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open and none shall shut; and he shall shut and none shall open.","And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his Father's house' (Isa 22:22,23).","For a glorious throne to his Father's house, that is, for his Father's house, to come to their Father by; for that they shall always find him thereon; or, as another scripture saith, in Christ reconciling them unto him, not imputing to them their trespasses and sins (2 Cor 5:19).","Nor is it possible, that we lay aside the human nature of Christ, for us to find any such thing as a throne of grace, either in earth or heaven; for that then nothing can be found to be the rest of God.","'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,' is God's own language; but there is none other of whom he hath so said (Matt 3:17).","Wherefore he resteth in him towards us, and in him only.","Besides, grace cannot be extended towards us but in a way of justice; for that the law and our sin obstructeth another way (Gen 3:24).","But, lay the human nature of Christ aside, and where will you find, THAT that shall become such a sacrifice to justice for the sin of men, as that God, for the sake of that, shall both forgive, and cause that grace for ever should reign towards us in such a way?","It reigns through righteousness, or justice, by Jesus Christ, and no way else.","Christ Jesus, therefore, is this throne of grace; or him, or that, by which grace reigns towards the children of God (Rom 5:21).","That scripture also gives us a little light herein, 'And I beheld, and lo!","in the midst of the throne,' &c., 'stood a Lamb, as it had been slain' (Rev 5:6).","This is to show the cause why grace is so freely let out to us, even for that there stands there, in the midst of the throne, and in the midst of the elders, a lamb as it had been slain, or, as it was made a sacrifice for our sin; for, as a slain lamb, he now lives in the midst of the throne, and is the meritorious cause of all the grace that we enjoy.","And though it seems by this text that the throne is one thing and the Lamb another, yet the Lamb of God is the throne, though not as a lamb or sacrifice, but as one that by his sacrifice has made way for grace to run like a river into the world.","The Son of God, Jesus Christ, is ALL; he is the throne, the altar, the priest, the sacrifice, and all: but he is the throne, the priest, the altar, and the sacrifice, under divers considerations.",He is not the throne as he is the priest; he is not the priest as he is the sacrifice; he is not the sacrifice as he is the altar; yet is truly all these.,"Yea, there is no throne of grace, no high priest, no propitiatory sacrifice, &c., but he.",Of all which we may yet speak further before we conclude this treatise.,"I conclude, then, that Christ Jesus, in his human nature, is this throne of grace.","In his human nature, I say, he has by that completely accomplished all things necessary for the making way for grace to be extended to men; and that that is not only God's place of rest, but that by and from which, as upon a glorious throne, his grace shall reign over devil, death, sin, hell, and the grave, for ever.",This human nature of Christ is also called the tabernacle of God; for the fullness of the Godhead dwells in it bodily.,"It is God's habitation, his dwelling-place, his chair and throne of state.","He doth all in and by it, and without it he doth not any thing.","But to pass this, let us come to the next thing.",[Where the throne of grace is erected.],Second.,"We will now come to discourse of the placing of this throne of grace, or to discover where it is erected.","And for this we must repair to the type, which, as was said before, is called the mercy-seat; the which we find, not in the outward court, nor yet within the first veil (Heb 9:3-5); which signifies, not in the world, nor in the church on earth, but in the holy of the holies, or after the second veil, the flesh of Christ (Heb 10:20).","There then is this throne of God, this throne of grace, and no where here below.","And for as much as it is called the throne of God, of grace, and is there, it signifieth that it is the highest and most honourable.","Hence he is said to be far above all heavens, and to have a name above every name.","Wherefore he that will come to this throne of grace, must know what manner of coming it is by which he must approach it; and that is, not personally,[6] but by runnings out of heart; not by himself, but by his Priest, his High Priest; for so it was in the type (Heb 9:7).","Into the second, where the mercy-seat was, went the high priest alone, that is, personally, and the people by him, as he made intercession for them.",This then must be done by those that will approach this throne of grace.,"They must go to God, as he is enthroned IN Christ; BY Christ, as he is the High Priest of his church; and they must go to him in the holiest, by him.","But again, as this throne of grace is in the Holiest, not in the world, not in the church on earth, so it is in this Holiest set up above the ark of the testimony; for so was the mercy-seat, it was set up in the most holy place, above the ark of the testimony (Deut 10:1-5; 1 Kings 8:9; 2 Chron 5:10).",The ark of the testimony.,What was that?,"Why it was the place of the law, the ark in which it was kept: the testimony was the law, the ark was prepared to put that in.","This ark in which was put this law was set up in the holiest, and the mercy-seat was set above it, for so was Moses commanded to place them.","Thou shalt make an ark, saith God, 'and thou shalt make a mercy-seat': the ark shall be called the ark of the testimony, and there 'thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee,' that is, the law, 'and thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark, and there I will meet with thee, from above the mercy-seat between the two cherubims, which are upon,' that is, above, 'the ark of the testimony,' 'shadowing the mercy-seat' (Exo 25:16-22; Heb 9:5).","Thus, then, were things of old ordained in the type, by which we gather what is now to be minded in our worshipping of God.","There was an ark made, and the two tables of stone, in which the law was writ, was put therein (Deut 10:2-5).","This ark, with these two tables, were put into the holiest, and this mercy-seat was set above it.","The Holy Ghost, in my mind, thus signifying that grace sits upon a throne that is higher than the law, above the law; and that grace, therefore, is to rule before the law, and notwithstanding all the sentence of the law; for it sitteth, I say, upon a throne, but the law sits on none; a throne, I say, which the law, instead of accusing, justifieth and approveth.","For although it condemneth all men, yet it excepteth Christ, who, in his manhood, is this throne of grace.","Him, I say, it condemneth not, but approveth, and liketh well of all his doings; yea, it granteth him, as here we see, as a throne of grace, to be exalted above itself: yea, it cannot but so do, because by wisdom and holiness itself, which is also the Lord of the law, it is appointed so to do.","Here, then, is the throne of God, the throne of grace, namely, above the ark of the testimony; on this God and his grace sits, reigns, and gives leave to sinners to approach his presence for grace and mercy.","He gives, I say for those sinners so to do, that have washed before in the brazen laver that is prepared to wash in first, of which we may speak more anon.","Now, behold the wisdom of God in his thus ordaining of things; in his placing, in the first place, the law, and Christ the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat, or throne of grace, so nigh together; for doubtless it was wisdom that thus ordained them, and it might so ordain for these reasons-- [Why the law and the mercy-seat are so near together.]",1.,"That we that approach the throne of grace might, when we come there, be made still to remember that we are sinners--'for by the law is the knowledge of sin' (Rom 3:20)--and behold just before us is this ark in which are the two tables that condemn all flesh: yea, we must look that way, if we look at all; for just above it is the mercy-seat or throne of grace.","So then here is a memento for them that come to God, and to his throne of grace, for mercy, to wit, the law, by which they are afresh put in remembrance of themselves, their sins, and what need they have of fresh supplies of grace.","I read that the laver of brass and the foot of it was made of the looking-glasses of the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle (Exo 38:8), methinks to signify, that men might see their smyrches[7] when they came to wash; so here you see the law is placed even with the mercy-seat, only that stood above, whereby those that come to the throne of grace for mercy might also yet more be put in mind that they are sinners.",2.,"This also tendeth to set an edge upon prayer, and to make us the more fervent in spirit when we come to the throne of grace.","Should a king ordain that the axe and halter should be before all those that supplicate him for mercy, it would put yet an edge upon all their petitions for his grace, and make them yet the more humbly and fervently implore his majesty for favour.","But, behold, the mercy-seat stands above, is set up above the ark and testimony that is in it.","Here, therefore, we have encouragement to look for good.","For observe, though here is the law, and that too in the holiest of all, whither we go; yet above it is the mercy-seat and throne of grace triumphant, unto which we should look, and to which we should direct our prayers.","Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, notwithstanding the ark and testimony is by; for the law cannot hurt us when grace is so nigh; besides, God is now not in the law, but upon the throne of grace that is above it, to gave forth pardons, and grace, and helps at a time of need.","This, then, may serve to inform some whereabout they are, when they are in their closets, and at prayer.",Art thou most dejected when thou art at prayer?,"Hear me, thou art not far from the throne of grace; for thy dejection proceedeth from thy looking into the ark, into which God hath ordained that whosoever looks shall die (1 Sam 6:19).","Now if thou art indeed so near as to see thy sins, by thy reading of thyself by the tables in the ark, cast but up thine eyes a little higher, and behold, there is the mercy-seat and throne of grace to which thou wouldest come, and by which thou must be saved.","When David came to pray to God, he said he would direct his prayer to God, and would look up (Psa 5:3).","As who should say, When I pray, I will say to my prayers, O my prayers, mount up, stay not at the ark of the testimony, for there is the law and condemnation; but soar aloft to the throne that stands above, for there is God, and there is grace displayed, and there thou mayest obtain what is necessary to help in time of need.","Some, indeed, there be that know not what these things mean; they never read their sin nor condemnation for it; when they are upon their knees at their devotion, and so are neither dejected at the sight of what they are, nor driven with sense of things to look higher for help at need; for need, indeed, they see none.","Of such I shall say, they are not concerned in our text, nor can they come hither before they have been prepared so to do, as may appear before we come to an end.",[How the godly distinguish the throne of grace.],SECOND.,"And thus have I showed you what this throne of grace is, and where it stands.","And now I shall come to show you how you shall find it, and know when you are come to it, by several other things.","First, then, about the throne of grace there is 'a rainbow--in sight like unto an emerald' (Rev 4:1-3).",This was the first sight that John saw after he had received his epistles for the seven churches.,"Before he received them, he had the great vision of his Lord, and heard him say to him, I am he that was dead and am alive, or 'that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, amen; and have the keys of hell and of death' (Rev 1:18).","And a good preparation it was for a work of that nature that now he was called unto; to wit, that he might the more warmly, and affectionately, and confidently attest the truth which his Lord had now for him to testify to them.","So here, before he entereth upon his prophecy of things to come, he hears a first voice, and sees a first sight.","The first voice that he heard was, 'Come up hither,' and the first sight that he saw was a throne with a rainbow round about it.","'And immediately,' saith he, 'I was in the Spirit; and behold a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.","And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper, and a sardine stone, and there was a rainbow round about the throne' (Rev 4:1-3).","The firs time that we find in God's Word mention made of a rainbow, we read also of its spiritual signification, to wit, that it was a token of the firmness of the covenant that God made with Noah, as touching his not drowning the earth any more with the waters of a flood.","'I do set,' saith he, 'my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.","And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud.","And I will remember my covenant which is between me and you, and every living creature of all flesh: and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh' (Gen 9:13-15).","The first use, therefore, of the rainbow, it was to be a token of a covenant of mercy and kindness to the world; but that was not the utmost end thereof.","For that covenant was but a shadow of the covenant of grace which God hath made with his elect in Christ, and that bow but a shadow of the token of the permanency and lastingness of that covenant.","Wherefore the next time we read of the rainbow is in the first of Ezekiel, and there we read of it only with reference to the excellencies of its colour; for that it is there said to be exactly like the colour of the glory of the man that the prophet there saw as sitting upon a throne (v 28).","The glory, that is, the priestly robes; for he is a priest upon the throne, and his robes become his glory and beauty (Zech 6:13).","His robes--what are they but his blessed righteousness, with the skirts of which he covereth the sinful nakedness of his people, and with the perfection of which he decketh and adorneth them, 'as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels' (Exo 28:2; Eze 16:8; Isa 61:10).","Now here again, in the third place, we find a rainbow, a rainbow round about the throne; round about the throne of grace.","A rainbow--that is, a token of the covenant, a token of the covenant of grace in its lastingness; and that token is the appearance of the man Christ.","The appearance--that is, his robes, his righteousness, 'from the appearance of his loins even upward,' and 'from the appearance of his loins even downward' (Eze 1:27); even down to the foot, as you have it in the book of the Revelation (1:13).","'As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.",This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord' (Eze 1:28).,"The sum then is, that by the rainbow round about the throne of grace upon which God sitteth to hear and answer the petitions of his people, we are to understand the obedential righteousness of Jesus Christ, which in the days of his flesh he wrought out and accomplished for his people; by which God's justice is satisfied, and their person justified, and they so made acceptable to him.","This righteousness, that shines in God's eyes more glorious than the rainbow in the cloud doth in ours, saith John, is round about the throne.",But for what purpose?,"Why, to be looked upon.",But who must look upon it?,"Why, God and his people; the people when they come to pray, and God when he is about to hear and give.","'And the bow shall be in the cloud'; says God, 'and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth' (Gen 9:16).","And, I say, as the bow is for God to look on, so it is also for our sight to behold.","A rainbow round about the throne, in sight; in whose sight?","in John's and his companions, like unto an emerald.","We read of Solomon's great throne of ivory, that though there was not its like in any kingdom, yet he was not willing that the bow of it should stand before him.",It was round behind (1 Kings 10:18-20).,O!,"but God's throne has the bow before, even round about to view, to look upon in sight.","Solomon's was but a shadow, and therefore fit to be put behind; but this is the sum and substance, and therefore fit to be before, in view, in sight, for God and his people to behold.","Thus you see that a rainbow is round about the throne of grace, and what this rainbow is.","Look then, when thou goest to prayer, for the throne; and that thou mayest not be deceived with a fancy, look for the rainbow too.","The rainbow, that is, as I have said, the personal performances of Christ thy Saviour for thee.","Look, I say, for that, it is his righteousness; the token of the everlastingness of the covenant of grace; the object of God's delight, and must be the matter of the justification of thy person and performances before God.","God looks at it, look thou at it, and at it only (Psa 71:16).","For in heaven or earth, if that be cast away, there is nothing to be found that can please God, or justify thee.","If it be said faith pleases God; I answer, faith is a relative grace; take then the relative away, which, as to justification, is this spangling robe, this rainbow, this righteousness of Christ, and faith dies, and becomes, as to what we now treat of, extinct and quenched as tow.",And a very fit emblem the rainbow is of the righteousness of Christ; and that in these particulars.,1.,"The rainbow is an effect of the sun that shines in the firmament; and the righteousness by which this throne of grace is encompassed, is the work of the Son of God.",2.,The rainbow was a token that the wrath of God in sending the flood was appeased; this righteousness of Christ is that for the sake of which God forgiveth us all trespasses.,3.,"The rainbow was set in the cloud, that the sinful man might look thereon, and wax confident in common mercy; this righteousness is showed us in the word, that we may by it believe unto special mercy.",4.,The bow is seen but now and then in the cloud; Christ's righteousness is but here and there revealed in the Word.,5.,"The bow is seen commonly upon, or after rain; Christ's righteousness is apprehended by faith upon, or soon after the apprehensions of wrath.",6.,"The bow is seen sometimes more, sometimes less; and so is this righteousness, even according to the degree or clearness of the sight of faith.",7.,"The bow is of that nature, as to make whatever you shall look upon through it, to be of the same colour of itself, whether that thing be bush, or man, or beast; and the righteousness of Christ is that that makes sinners, when God looks upon them through it, to look beautiful, and acceptable in his sight, for we are made comely through his comeliness, and made accepted in the Beloved (Eze 16:14; Eph 1:6).","One word more of the rainbow, and then to some other things.","As here you read that the rainbow is round about the throne; so if you read on even in the same place, you shall find the glorious effects thereof to be far more than all that I have said.","But, Second.","As the throne of grace is known by the rainbow that is round about it; so also thou shalt know it by this, the high priest is continually ministering before it; the high priest, or Christ as priest, is there before God in his high priest's robes, making continual intercession for thy acceptance there.","Now, as I said before, Christ is priest and throne and all; throne in one sense, priest in another; even as he was priest, and sacrifice, and altar too, when he became our reconciler to God.","As a priest here, he is put under the notion of an angel, of an angel that came and stood at the altar to offer incense for the church, all the time that the seven angels were to sound out with trumpets the alarm of God's wrath against the anti-christian world; lest that wrath should swallow them up also.","'And,' saith John, 'another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saint upon the golden altar which was before the throne.","And the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand' (Rev 8:1-4).","Here then you have before the throne, that is, the throne or mercy-seat, the high priest; for there it was that God appointed that the altar of incense, or that to burn incense on, should be placed (Exo 30:1-7).","This incense-altar in the type was to be overlaid with gold; but here the Holy Ghost implies, that it is all of gold.","This throne then is the mercy-seat, or throne of grace, to which we are bid to come; and, as you see, here is the angel, the high priest with his golden censer, and his incense, ready to wait upon us.","For so the text implies, for he is there to offer his incense with the prayers of all saints that are waiting without at his time of offering incense within (Luke 1:10).","So, then, at the throne of grace, or before it, stands the high priest of our propitiation, Christ Jesus, with his golden censer in his hand, full of incense, therewith to perfume the prayers of saints, that come thither for grace and mercy to help in time of need.","[8] And he stands there, as you see, under the name of an angel, for he is the angel of God's presence, and messenger of his covenant.","But now it is worth our considering, to take notice how, or in what method, the high priest under the law was to approach the incense-altar.","When he came to make intercession for the saints before the throne, he was to go in thither to do this work in his robes and ornaments; not without them, lest he died.","The principal of these ornaments were, 'a breast-plate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle' (Exo 28:4).","These are briefly called his garments, in Revelation the first, and in the general they show us, that he is clothed with righteousness, girded with truth and faithfulness, for that is the girdle of his reins to strengthen him (Isa 11:5).","And that he beareth upon his heart the names of the children of Israel that are Israelites indeed; for as on Aaron's breast-plate was fixed the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and he was to bear the weight of them by the strength of his shoulders, so are we on the heart of Christ (Isa 22:21).","Thus therefore is our high priest within the holiest to offer incense upon the golden altar of incense, that is, before the throne.","Wherefore, when thou goest thither, even to 'the throne of grace,' look for him, and be not content, though thou shouldst find God there, if thou findest him not there, I suppose now an impossibility, for edification's sake, for without him nothing can be done; I say, without him as a priest.","He is the throne, and without him as a throne, God has no resting-place as to us; he is a priest, and without him as such we can make no acceptable approach to God; for by him as priest our spiritual sacrifices are accepted (1 Peter 2:5).","'By him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually,--giving thanks,' and confessing to and 'in his name' (Heb 13:15).","And for our further edification herein, let us consider, that as God has chosen and made him his throne of grace; so he has sworn, that he shall be accepted as a priest for ever there.","For his natural qualifications we may speak something to them afterwards; in the meantime know, that there is no coming to God, upon pain of death without him.","Nor will it out of my mind, but that his wearing the rainbow upon his head doth somewhat belong to him as priest, his priestly vestments being for glory and beauty, as afore was said, compared to the colour of it (Rev 10:1; Eze 1).","But why doth he wear the rainbow upon his head; but to show, that the sign, that the everlastingness of the covenant of grace is only to be found in him; that he wears it as a mitre or frontlet of gold, and can always plead it with acceptance to God, and for the subduing of the world and good of his people.","But, Thirdly, The throne of grace is to be known by the sacrifice that is presented there.","The high priest was not to go into the holiest, nor come near the mercy-seat; the which, as I have showed you, was a type of our throne of grace, 'without blood.'","'But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people' (Heb 9:7).","Yea, the priest was to take of the blood of his sacrifice, and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, that is, before the mercy-seat, or throne of grace; and was to put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of incense before the Lord (Lev 4:5-7, 16:13-15).","So then the throne of grace is known by the blood that is sprinkled thereon, and by the atonement that by it is made there.","I told you before that before the throne of grace there is our high-priest; and now I tell you, there is his sacrifice too; his sacrifice which he there presenteth as amends for the sins of all such as have a right to come with boldness to the throne of grace.","Hence, as I mentioned before, there is said to be in the midst of the throne, the same throne of which we have spoken before, 'a lamb as it had been slain' (Rev 5:6).","The words are to the purpose, and signify that in the midst of the throne is our sacrifice, with the very marks of his death upon him; showing to God that sitteth upon the throne, the holes of the thorns, of the nails, of the spear; and how he was disfigured with blows and blood when at his command he gave himself a ransom for his people; for it cannot be imagined that either the exaltation or glorification of the body of Jesus Christ should make him forget the day in which he died the death for our sins; specially since that which puts worth into his whole intercession is the death he died, and the blood he shed upon the cross, for our trespasses.","Besides, there is no sight more taketh the heart of God, than to see of the travail of the soul, and the bruisings of the body of his Son for our transgressions.","Hence it is said, He 'is in the midst of the throne' as he died, or as he had been slain (Rev 7:17).","It is said again, 'The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them.'","The Lamb, that is, the Son of God as a sacrifice, shall be always in the midst of the throne to feed and comfort his people.","He is the throne, he is the priest, he is the sacrifice.",But then how as a Lamb is he in the midst of the throne?,"Why, the meaning in mine opinion is, that Christ, as a dying and bleeding sacrifice, shall be chief in the reconciling of us to God; or that his being offered for our sins shall be of great virtue when pleaded by him as priest, to the obtaining of grace, mercy, and glory for us (Heb 9:12).",By his blood he entered into the holy place; by his blood he hath made an atonement for us before the mercy-seat.,His blood it is that speaketh better for us than the blood of Abel did for Cain (Heb 12:24).,Also it is by his blood that we have bold admittance into the holiest (Heb 10:19).,"Wherefore no marvel if you find him here a Lamb, as it had been slain, and that in the midst of the throne of grace.","While thou art therefore thinking on him, as he is the throne of grace, forget him not as he is priest and sacrifice; for as a priest he makes atonement; but there is no atonement made for sin without a sacrifice.","Now, as Christ is a sacrifice, so he is to be considered as passive, or a sufferer; as he is a priest, so he is active, or one that hath offered up himself; as he is an altar, so he is to be considered as God; for in and upon the power of his Godhead he offered up himself.","The altar then was not the cross, as some have foolishly imagined.","But as a throne, a throne of grace; so he is to be considered as distinct from these three things, as I also have hinted before.","Wouldst thou then know this throne of grace, where God sits to hear prayers and give grace?","then cast the eyes of thy soul about, and look till thou findest the Lamb there; a Lamb there 'as it had been slain,' for by this thou shalt know thou art right.","A slain Lamb, or a Lamb as it had been slain, when it is seen by a supplicant in the midst of the throne, whither he is come for grace, is a blessed sight!",A blessed sight indeed!,And it informs him he is where he should be.,"And thou must look for this, the rather because without blood is no remission.","He that thinks to find grace at God's hand, and yet enters not into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, will find himself mistaken, and will find a DEAD,[9] instead of 'a living way' (Heb 10:19).","For if not anything below, or besides blood, can yield remission on God's part, how should remission be received by us without our acting faith therein?","We are justified by his blood, through faith in his blood (Rom 5:6-9).","Wherefore, I say, look when thou approachest the throne of grace, that thou give diligence to see for the Lamb; that is, 'as it had been slain' in the midst of the throne of grace; and then thou wilt have, not only a sign that thou presentest thy supplications to God, where, and as thou shouldst; but there also wilt thou meet with matter to break, to soften, to bend, to bow, and to make thy heart as thou wouldst have it; for if the blood of a goat will, as some say, dissolve an adamant, a stone that is harder than flint;[10] shall not the sight of 'a Lamb as it had been slain' much more dissolve and melt down the spirit of that man that is upon his knees before the throne of grace for mercy; especially when he shall see, that not his prayers, not his tears, not his wants, but the blood of the Lamb, has prevailed with a God of grace to give mercy and grace to an undeserving man?","This then is the third sign by which thou shalt know when thou art at the throne of grace: that throne is sprinkled with blood; yea, in the midst of that throne there is to be seen to this day, a Lamb as it had been slain; and he is in the midst of it, to feed those that come to that throne, and to lead them by and to 'living fountains of waters' (Rev 7:17).","Wherefore, Fourth.","The throne of grace is to be known, by the streams of grace that continually proceed therefrom, and that like a river run themselves out into the world.","And, saith John, 'He showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb' (Rev 22:1).","Mark you, here is again a throne; the throne of God, which, as we have showed, is the human nature of his Son; out of which, as you read, proceeds a river, a river of water of life, clear as crystal.","And the joining of the Lamb also here with God is to show that it comes, I say, from God, by the Lamb; by Christ, who as a lamb or sacrifice for sin, is the procuring cause of the running of this river; it proceedeth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.","Behold, therefore, how carefully here the Lamb is brought in, as one from or through whom proceeds the water of life to us.",God is the spring-head; Christ the golden pipe of conveyance; the elect the receivers of this water of life.,"He saith not here, 'the throne of the Lamb,' but 'and of the Lamb, to show, I say, that he it is out of or through whom this river of grace should come.'","But and if it should be understood that it proceedeth from the throne of the Lamb, it may be to show that Christ also has power as a mediator, to send grace like a river into the church.","And then it amounts to this, that God, for Christ's sake, gives this river of grace, and that Christ, for his merits sake, has power to do so too.","And hence is that good wish, so often mentioned in the epistles, 'Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ' (Rom 1:7; 1 Cor 1:3; 2 Cor 1:2; Gal 1:3; Eph 1:2; Phil 1:2; Col 1:2; 1 Thess 1:2; 2 Thess 1:2; Phile 3).","And again, 'Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ' (1 Peter 1:2; 2 Tim 1:2; Titus 1:4).",For Christ has power with the Father to give grace and forgiveness of sins to men (John 5:21-26; Mark 2:10).,But let us come to the terms in this text.,"Here we have a throne, a throne of grace; and to show that this throne is it indeed, therefore there proceeds therefrom a river of this grace, put here under the term of 'water of life,' a term fit to express both the nature of grace and the condition of him that comes for it to the throne of grace.","It is called by the name of water of life, to show what a reviving cordial the grace of God in Christ is, shall be, and will be found to be, of all those that by him shall drink thereof.","It shall be in him, even in him that drinks it, 'a well of water springing up into everlasting life' (John 4:14).","It will therefore beget life, and maintain it; yea, will itself be a spring of life, in the very heart of him that drinks it.",Ah!,"it will be such a preservative also to spiritual health, as that by its virtue the soul shall for ever be kept, I say, the soul that drinks it, from total and final decay; it shall be in them a well of living water, springing up into everlasting life.","But there is also by this phrase or term briefly touched the present state of them that shall come hither to drink; they are not the healthful, but the sick.","It is with the throne of grace, as it is with the Bath, and other places of sovereign and healing waters, they are most coveted of them that are diseased, and do also show their virtues on those that have their health and limbs; so, I say, is the throne of grace; its waters are for healing, for soul-healing, that is their virtue (Eze 47:8,9).","Wherefore, as at those waters above mentioned, the lame leave their crutches, and the sick [obtain] such signs of their recovery as may be a sign of their receiving health and cure there; so at the throne of grace, it is where true penitents, and those that are sick for mercy, do leave their sighs and tears; 'and the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall,' there, 'wipe away all tears from their eyes' (Rev 7:17).","Wherefore, as Joseph washed his face, and dried his tears away, when he saw his brother Benjamin, so all God's saints shall here, even at the throne of grace, where God's Benjamin, or the Son of his right hand, is, wash their souls from sorrow, and have their tears wiped from their eyes.","Wherefore, O thou that are diseased, afflicted, and that wouldst live, come by Jesus to God as merciful and gracious; yea, look for this river when thou art upon thy knees before him, for by that thou shalt find whereabout is the throne of grace, and so where thou mayest find mercy.","But again, as that which proceeds out of this throne of grace is called 'water of life,' so it is said to be a river, a river of water of life.","This, in the first place, shows, that with God is plenty of grace, even as in a river there is plenty of water; a pond, a pool, a cistern, will hold much, but a river will hold more; from this throne come rivers and streams of water of life, to satisfy those that come for life to the throne of God.","Further, as by a river is showed what abundance of grace proceeds from God through Christ, so it shows the unsatiable thirst and desire of one that comes indeed aright to the throne of grace for mercy.","Nothing but rivers will satisfy such a soul; ponds, pools, and cisterns, will do nothing: such an one is like him of whom it is said, 'Behold he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not; he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth' (Job 40:23).","This David testifies when he saith, 'As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God' (Psa 42:1).","Hence the invitation is proportionable, 'Drink abundantly' (Cant 5:1), and that they that are saved, are saved to receive abundance of grace; 'they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ' (Rom 5:17).","And hence it is said again, 'When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.'","But, Lord, how wilt thou quench their boundless thirst?","'I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water' (Isa 41:17,18).","Behold here is a pool of water as big as a wilderness, enough one would think to satisfy any thirsty soul.","O, but that will not do!","wherefore he will open rivers, fountains, and springs, and all this is to quench the drought of one that thirsteth for the grace of God, that they have enough.","'They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house, and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures, for with thee is the fountain of life'; &c. (Psa 36:8,9).","This abundance the throne of grace yieldeth for the help and health of such as would have the water of life to drink, and to cure their diseases withal: it yields a river of water of life.","Moreover, since grace is said here to proceed as a river from the throne of God and of the Lamb, it is to show the commonness of it; rivers you know are common in the stream, however they are at the head (Judg 5).","And to show the commonness of it, the apostle calls it 'the common salvation'; and it is said in Ezekiel and Zecharias, to go forth to the desert, and into the sea, the world, to heal the beasts and fish of all kinds that are there (Eze 47:8; Zech 14:8).","This, therefore, is a text that shows us what it is to come to a throne, where the token of the covenant of grace is, where the high priest ministereth, and in the midst of which there is a Lamb, 'as it had been slain': for from thence there cometh not drops, nor showers, but rivers of the grace of God, a river of water of life.","Again, as the grace that we here read of is said, as it comes from this throne, to come as a river of water of life; so it is said to be pure and clear as crystal.","Pure is set in opposition to muddy and dirty waters, and clear is set in opposition to those waters that are black, by reason of the cold and icyish nature of them; therefore there is conjoined to this phrase the word crystal, which all know is a clear and shining stone (Eze 34:19; Job 6:15,16).","Indeed the life and spirit that is in this water, will keep it from looking black and dull; and the throne from whence it comes will keep it from being muddy, so much as in the streams thereof.","'The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it' (Prov 10:22).","Indeed, all the sorrow that is mixed with our Christianity, it proceedeth, as the procuring cause, from ourselves, not from the throne of grace; for that is the place where our tears, as was showed you, are wiped away; and also where we hang up our crutches.","The streams thereof are pure and clear, not muddy nor frozen, but warm and delightful, and that 'make glad the city of God' (Psa 46).","These words also show us, that this water of itself can do without a mixture of anything of ours.","What comes from this throne of grace is pure grace, and nothing else; clear grace, free grace, grace that is not mixed, nor need be mixed with works of righteousness which we have done; it is of itself sufficient to answer all our wants, to heal all our diseases, and to help us at a time of need.","It is grace that chooses, it is grace that calleth, it is grace that preserveth, and it is grace that brings to glory: even the grace that like a river of water of life proceedeth from this throne.","And hence it is, that from first to last, we must cry, 'Grace, grace unto it!","'[11] Thus you see what a throne the Christian is invited to; it is a throne of grace whereon doth sit the God of all grace; it is a throne of grace before which the Lord Jesus ministereth continually for us; it is a throne of grace sprinkled with the blood, and in the midst of which is a Lamb as it had been slain; it is a throne with a rainbow round about it, which is the token of the everlasting covenant, and out of which proceeds, as here you read, a river, a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal.","Look then for these signs of the throne of grace, all you that would come to it, and rest not, until by some of them you know that you are even come to it; they are all to be seen have you but eyes; and the sight of them is very delectable, and has a natural tendency in them, when seen, to revive and quicken the soul.","But, Fifth.","As the throne of grace is known and distinguished by the things above named, so it is by the effects which these things have wrought.","There is about that throne 'four and twenty seats, and upon the seats four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment, and they have on their heads crowns of gold' (Rev 4:4).","There is no throne that has these signs and effects belonging to it but this; wherefore, as by these signs, so by the effects of them also, one may know which is, and so when he is indeed come to the throne of grace.","And a little as we commented upon what went before, we will also touch upon this.",1.,"By seats, I understand places of rest and dignity; places of rest, for that they that sit on them do rest from their labours; and places of dignity, for that they are about the throne (Rev 14:13).","'And the four and twenty elders which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces and worshipped God' (Rev 11:16).","And forasmuch as the seats are mentioned, before they are mentioned that sat thereon, it is to show, that the places were prepared before they were converted.",2.,"The elders, I take to be the twelve patriarchs and the twelve apostles, or the first fathers of the churches; for they are the elders of both the churches, that is, both of the Jewish and Gentile church of God; they are the ancients, as also they are called in the prophet Isaiah, which are in some sense the fathers of both these churches (Isa 24:23).","These elders are well set forth by that four and twenty that you read of in the book of Chronicles, who had every one of them for sons twelve in number.",There therefore the four and twenty are (1 Chron 25:8-31).,3.,Their sitting denoteth also their abiding in the presence of God.,"'Sit thou at my right hand,' was the Father's word to the Son, and also signifieth the same (Psa 110:1).","It is then the throne of grace where the four and twenty seats are, and before which the four and twenty elders sit.",4.,"Their white robes are Christ's righteousness, their own good works and glory; not that their works brought them thither, for they were of themselves polluted, and were washed white in the blood of the Lamb; but yet God will have all that his people have done in love to him to be rewarded.","Yea, and they shall wear their own labours, being washed as afore is hinted, as a badge of their honour before the throne of grace, and this is grace indeed.","'They have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, therefore are they before the throne of God' (Rev 7:14,15).",They have washed as others did do before them.,5.,'And they had on their heads crowns of gold' (Rev 4:4).,"This denotes their victory, and also that they are kings, and as kings shall reign with him for ever and ever (Rev 5:10).",6.,But what!,were they silent?,"did they say, did they do nothing while they sat before the throne?","Yes, they were appointed to be singers there.","This was signified by the four and twenty that we made mention of before, who with their sons were instructed in the songs of the Lord, and all that were cunning to do so then, were two hundred fourscore and eight (1 Chron 25:7).",These were the figure of that hundred forty and four thousand redeemed from the earth.,"For as the first four and twenty, and their sons, are said to sing and to play upon cymbals, psalteries, and harps; and as they are there said to be instructed and cunning in the songs of the Lord; so these that sit before the throne are said also to sing with harps in their hands their song before the throne; and such song it was, and so cunningly did they sing it, that 'no man could learn it, but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth' (Rev 14:3).","Now, as I said, as he at first began with four and twenty in David, and ended with four and twenty times twelve, so here in John he begins with the same number, but ends with such a company that no man could number.","For, he saith, 'After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.","And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God, which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.","And all the angels stood round about the throne, and the elders, and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God' (Rev 7:9-11).","This numberless number seems to have got the song by the end;[12] for they cry aloud, 'Salvation, salvation to our God and to the Lamb'; which to be sure is such a song that none can learn but them that are redeemed from the earth.","But I say, what a brave encouragement is it for one that is come for grace to the throne of grace, to see so great a number already there, on their seats, in their robes, with their palms in their hands, and their crowns upon their heads, singing of salvation to God, and to the Lamb!","And I say again, and speak now to the dejected, methinks it would be strange, O thou that art so afraid that the greatness of thy sins will be a bar unto thee, if amongst all this great number of pipers and harpers that are got to glory, thou canst not espy one that when here was as vile a sinner as thyself.","Look man, they are there for thee to view them, and for thee to take encouragement to hope, when thou shalt consider what grace and mercy has done for them.","Look again, I say, now thou art upon thy knees, and see if some that are among them have not done worse than thou hast done.","And yet behold, they are set down; and yet behold they have their crowns on their heads, their harps in their hands, and sing aloud of salvation to their God, and to the Lamb.",This then is a fifth note or sign that doth distinguish the throne of grace from other thrones.,"There are, before that, to be seen, for our encouragement, a numberless number of people sitting and singing round about it.","Singing, I say, to God for his grace, and to the Lamb for his blood, by which they are secured from the wrath to come.","'And the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints, and they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God, kings and priests, and we shall reign on the earth' (Rev 5:8-10).","Behold, tempted soul, dost thou not yet see what a throne of grace here is, and what multitudes are already arrived thither, to give thanks unto his name that sits thereon, and to the Lamb for ever and ever?","And wilt thou hang thy harp upon the willows, and go drooping up and down the world, as if there was no God, no grace, no throne of grace, to apply thyself unto, for mercy and grace to help in time of need?",Hark!,"dost thou not hear them what they say, 'Worthy,' say they, 'is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.","And every creature which is in heaven,' where they are, 'and on the earth,' where thou art, 'and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever' (Rev 5:12,13).","All this is written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope; and that the drooping ones might come boldly to the throne of grace, to obtain grace and find mercy to help in time of need.","They bless, they all bless; they thank, they all thank; and wilt thou hold thy tongue?","'They have all received of his fulness, and grace for grace'; and will he shut thee out?","Or is his grace so far gone, and so near spent, that now he has not enough to pardon, and secure, and save one sinner more?","For shame, leave off this unbelief!","Wherefore, dost thou think, art thou told of all this, but to encourage thee to come to the throne of grace?","And wilt thou hang back or be sullen, because thou art none of the first?","since he hath said, 'The first shall be last, and the last first.'","Behold the legions, the thousands, the untold and numberless number that stand before the throne, and be bold to hope in his mercy.",Sixth.,[The throne of grace is known by what proceeds from it.],"As the throne of grace is distinguished from other thrones by these, so 'out of this throne proceeds lightnings, and thunderings, and voices.'","Also before this throne are 'seven lamps of fire burning, which are the seven spirits of God' (Rev 4:5).",This then is another thing by which the throne of grace may be known as an effect of what is before.,"So again, chapter the eighth, it is said, that from the altar of incense that stood before the throne, 'there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake' (Rev 8:5).","All these then come out of the holiest, where the throne is, and are inflamed by this throne, and by him that sits thereon.",1.,Lightnings here are to be taken for the illuminations of the Spirit in the gospel (Heb 10:32).,"As it is said in the book of Psalms, 'They looked unto him,' on the throne, 'and were lightened' (Psa 34:5).","Or, as it is said in other places, 'The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven, the lightnings lightened the world' (Psa 77:18).","And again, 'His lightnings enlightened the world, the earth saw and trembled' (Psa 97:4).",This lightning therefore communicates light to them that sit in darkness.,"'God,' saith the apostle, 'who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ' (2 Cor 4:6).","It was from this throne that the light came that struck Paul off his horse, when he went to destroy it and the people that professed it (Acts 9:3).","These are those lightnings by which sinners are made to see their sad condition, and by which they are made to see the way out of it.","Art thou then made to see thy condition how bad it is, and that the way out of it is by Jesus Christ?","for, as I said, he is the throne of grace.","Why then, come orderly in the light of these convictions to the throne from whence thy light did come, and cry there, as Samuel did to Eli, 'Here am I, for thou has called[13] me' (1 Sam 3:8).","Thus did Saul by the light that made him see; by it he came to Christ, and cried, 'Who art thou, Lord?'","and, 'What wouldst thou have me do?'","(Acts 9:5,6).","And is it not an encouragement to thee to come to him, when he lights thy candle that thou mightest see the way; yea, when he doth it on purpose that thou mightest come to him?","'He gives light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death,' what to do?",'to guide our feet into the way of peace' (Luke 1:79).,"This interpretation of this place seems to me most to cohere with what went before; for first you have here a throne, and one sitting on it; then you have the elders, and in them presented to you the whole church, sitting round about the throne; then you have in the words last read unto you, a discourse how they came thither, and that is, by the lightnings, thunderings, and voices that proceed out of the throne.",2.,"As you have here lightnings, so thereto is adjoined thunders.",There proceeded out of this throne lightnings and thunders.,"By thunders, I understand that powerful discovery of the majesty of God by the word of truth, which seizeth the heart with a reverential dread and awe of him: hence it is said, 'The voice of the Lord is full of majesty; the voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars' (Psa 29:45).","The voice, that is, his thundering voice.",'Canst thou thunder with a voice like him?',(Job 40:9).,And 'the thunder of his power who can understand?',(Job 26:14).,"It was upon this account that Peter, and James, and John, were called 'the sons of thunder,' because, in the word which they were to preach, there was to be not only lightnings, but thunders; not only illuminations, but a great seizing of the heart, with the dread and majesty of God, to the effectual turning of the sinner to him (Mark 3:16,17).","Lightnings without thunder are in this case dangerous, because they that receive the one without the other are subject to miscarry.","They were 'once enlightened,' but you read of no thunder they had; and they were subject to fall into an irrecoverable state (Heb 6:4-6).","Saul had thunder with his lightnings to the shaking of his soul; so had the three thousand; so had the jailor (Acts 2, 9, 16).",They that receive light without thunder are subject to turn the grace of God into wantonness; but they that know the terror of God will persuade men (Rom 3:8; Jude 4; 2 Cor 5:11).,"So then, when he decrees to give the rain of his grace to a man, he makes 'a way for the lighting of the thunder,' not the one without the other, but the one following the other (Job 28:26).","Lightning and thunder is made a cause of rain, but lightning alone is not: 'Who hath divided a water-course for the overflowing of waters?","or a way for the lightning of thunder to cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is: on the wilderness wherein there is no man?'","(Job 38:25,26).","Thus therefore you may see how in the darkest sayings of the Holy Ghost there is as great an harmony with truth as in the most plain and easy; there must be thunder with light, if thy heart be well poised and balanced with the fear of God: we have had great lightnings in this land of late years, but little thunders; and that is one reason why so little grace is found where light is, and why so many professors run on their heads in such a day as this is, notwithstanding all they have seen.","Well then, this also should be a help to a soul to come to the throne of grace; the God of glory has thundered, has thundered to awaken thee, as well as sent lightnings to give thee light; to awaken thee to a coming to him, as well as to the enabling of thee to see his things; this then has come from the throne of grace to make thee come hither; wherefore observe, where it is by these signs made mention of before, and by these effects; and go, and come to the throne of grace.",3.,"As there proceeds from this throne lightnings and thunders, so from hence it is said voices proceed also: now these voices may be taken for such as are sent with this lightning and thunder to instruct, or for such [instruction] as this lightning and thunder begets in our hearts.",(1.),"It may be taken in the first sense for light and dread, when it falleth from God into the soul, is attended with a voice or voices of instruction to the soul, to know what to do (Acts 2:3-7).",This it was in Paul's case.,"He had light and dread, and voices for his instruction; he had lightnings, and thunderings, and voices: 'Good and upright is the Lord; therefore will he teach sinners in the way.","The meek will he guide in judgment; and the meek will he teach his way' (Psa 25:8,9).",(2.),"Or by voices you may understand, such as the lightning and thunder begets in our hearts: for though man is as mute as a fish to Godward, before this thunder and lightning comes to him, yet after that he is full of voices (2 Cor 4:13, 7:14).","And how much more numerous are the voices that in the whole church on earth are begot by these lightnings and thunders that proceed from the throne of grace; their faith has a voice, their repentance has a voice, their subjection to God's word has a voice in it; yea, there is a voice in their prayers, a voice in their cry, a voice in their tears, a voice in their groans, in their roarings, in their bemoaning of themselves, and in their triumphs!","(1 Thess 1:2-8; Psa 5:3, 7:17, 20:2-5, 22:1, 138:5; Jer 31:18).","This then is an effect of the throne of grace; hence it is said that they proceed from it, even the lightning, and the thunder, and the voices; that is, effectual conversion to God.","It follows then, that if all these are with thy soul, the operations of the throne of grace have been upon thee to bring thee to the throne of grace; first in thy prayers, and then in thy person.","And this leads me to the next thing propounded to be spoken to, which is to show who are the persons invited here to come to the throne of grace.",'Let us therefore come.',[THE PERSONS INTENDED BY THIS EXHORTATION.],THIRD.,"Now the persons here called upon to come to the throne of grace, are not all or every sort of men, but the men that may properly be comprehended under this word Us and We; 'let Us therefore come boldly, that We may obtain.'","And they that are here put under these particular terms, are expressed both before and after, by those that have explication in them.","They are called [in the epistle to the Hebrews], 1.",Such as give the most earnest heed to the word which they have heard (Heb 2:1).,2.,They are such as see Jesus crowned with glory and honour (Heb 2:9).,3.,They are called the children (Heb 2:14).,4.,They are called the seed of Abraham (Heb 2:16).,5.,They are called Christ's brethren (Heb 2:17).,"So, chapter the third, they are called holy brethren, and said to be partakers of the heavenly calling, and the people of whom it is said that Christ Jesus is the apostle and high priest of their profession (Heb 3:1-6).","They are called Christ's own house, and are said to be partakers of Christ (Heb 3:14).","They are said to be the believers, those that do enter in into rest, those that have Christ for a high priest, and with the feeling of whose infirmities he is touched and sympathiseth (Heb 4:3,14,15).","So, in chapter the sixth, they are called beloved, and the heirs of promise; they that have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before them; they are called those that have hope as an anchor, and those for whom Christ as a forerunner hath entered and taken possession of heaven (Heb 6:9,17-20).","So, chapter the seventh, they are said to be such as draw nigh unto God (Heb 7:19).","And, chapter the eighth, they are said to be such with whom the new covenant is made in Christ.","Chapter the ninth, they are such for whom Christ has obtained eternal redemption, and such for whom he has entered the holy place (Heb 9:12,22).","Chapter the tenth, they are such as are said to be sanctified by the will of God, such as have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus; such as draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, or that have liberty to do so, having their hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and their bodies washed with pure water; they were those that had suffered much for Christ in the world, and that became companions of them that so were used (Heb 10:10,19,22-25).","Yea, he tells them, in the eleventh chapter, that they and the patriarchs must be made perfect together (Heb 11:40).","He also tells them, in the twelfth chapter, that already they are come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels; to the general assembly and church of the first born which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all; and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the New Testament, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel (Heb 12:22-24).","Thus you see what terms, characters, titles, and privileges, they are invested with that are here exhorted to come to the throne of grace.","From whence we may conclude that every one is not capable of coming thither, no not every one that is under convictions, and that hath a sense of the need of and a desire after the mercy of God in Christ.",[The orderly coming to the throne of grace.],"Wherefore we will come, in the next place, to show the orderly coming of a soul to the throne of grace for mercy: and for this we must first apply ourselves to the Old Testament, where we have the shadow of what we now are about to enter upon the discourse of, and then we will come to the antitype, where yet the thing is far more explained.",First.,"Then, the mercy-seat was for the church, not for the world; for a Gentile could not go immediately from his natural state to the mercy-seat, by the high priest, but must first orderly join himself, or be joined, to the church, which then consisted of the body of the Jews (Exo 12:43-49).","The stranger then must first be circumcised, and consequently profess faith in the Messiah to come, which was signified by his going from his circumcision directly to the passover, and so orderly to other privileges, specially to this of the mercy-seat which the high priest was to go but once a year into (Eze 44:6-9).",Second.,The church is again set forth unto us by Aaron and his sons.,"Aaron as the head, his sons as the members; but the sons of Aaron were not to meddle with any of the things of the Holiest, until they had washed in a laver: 'And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash in; and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.",For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat.,"When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offerings made by fire unto the Lord.","So they shall wash their hands and their feet that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever unto them, even to him, and to his seed throughout their generations.'","See the margin (Exo 30:17-21, 40:30-32).",[14] Third.,"Nay, so strict was this law, that if any of Israel, as well as the stranger, were defiled by any dead thing, they were to wash before they partook of the holy things, or else to abstain: but if they did not, their sin should remain upon them (Lev 17:15,16).","So again, 'the soul that hath touched any such' uncleanness 'shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things,' much less come within the inner veil, 'unless he wash his flesh with water' (Lev 22:4-6).","Now, I would ask, what all this should signify, if a sinner, as a sinner, before he washes, or is washed, may immediately go unto the throne of grace?","Yea, I ask again, why the apostle supposes washing as a preparation to the Hebrews entering into the holiest, if men may go immediately from under convictions to a throne of grace?","For thus, he says, 'let us draw near' 'the holiest' (Heb 12:19), 'with a true heart, in full assurance of faith; having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water' (Heb 12:22).",Let us draw near; he saith not that we may have; but having FIRST been washed and sprinkled.,"The laver then must first be washed in; and he that washed not first there, has not right to come to the throne of grace; wherefore you have here also a sea of glass standing before the throne of grace, to signify this thing (Rev 4:6).","It stands before the throne, for them to wash in that would indeed approach the throne of grace.","For this sea of glass is the same that is shadowed forth by the laver made mention of before, and with the brazen sea that stood in Solomon's temple, whereat they were to wash before they went into the holiest.","But you may ask me, What the laver or molten sea should signify to us in the New Testament?","I answer, It signifieth the word of the New Testament, which containeth the cleansing doctrine of remission of sins, by the precious blood of Jesus Christ (John 15:3).","[15] Wherefore we are said to be clean through the Word, through the washing of water by the Word (Titus 3:5).","The meaning then is, A man must first come to Christ, as set forth in the Word, which is this sea of glass, before he can come to Christ in heaven, as he is the throne of grace.","For the Word, I say, is this sea of glass that stands before the throne, for the sinner to wash in first.","Know therefore, whoever thou art, that art minded to be saved, thou must first begin with Christ crucified, and with the promise of remission of sins through his blood; which crucified Christ thou shalt not find in heaven as such; for there he is alive; but thou shalt find him in the Word; for there he is to this day set forth in all the circumstances of his death, as crucified before our eyes (Gal 3:1,2).","There thou shalt find that he died, when he died, what death he died, why he died, and the Word open to thee to come and wash in his blood.","The word therefore of Christ's Testament is the laver for all New Testament priests, and every Christian is a priest to God, to wash in.","Here therefore thou must receive thy justification, and that before thou goest one step further; for if thou art not justified by his blood, thou wilt not be saved by his life.","And the justifying efficacy of his blood is left behind, and is here contained in the molten sea, or laver, or word of grace, for thee to wash in.","Indeed, there is an interceding voice in his blood for us before the throne of grace, or mercy-seat; but that is still to bring us to wash, or for them that have washed therein, as it was shed upon the cross.","We have boldness therefore to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, that is, by faith in his blood, as shed without the gate; for as his blood was shed without the gate, so it sanctifies the believer, and makes him capable to approach the holy of holies.","Wherefore, after he had said, 'That he might sanctify the people with his own blood,' he 'suffered without the gate' (Heb 13:11-15).","Let us by him therefore, that is, because we are first sanctified by faith in his blood, offer to God the sacrifice of praise continually, that is, the fruits of our lips, giving thanks in his name.","Wherefore the laver of regeneration, or Christ set forth by the Word as crucified, is for all coming sinners to wash in unto justification; and the throne of grace is to be approached by saints, or as sinners justified by faith in a crucified Christ; and so, as washed from sin in the sea of his blood, to come to the mercy-seat.","And it is yet far more evident; for that those that approach this throne of grace, they must do it through believing; for, saith the apostle, 'How shall they call on him in whom they have not believed,' of whom they have not heard, and in whom they have not believed?",for to that purpose runs the text (Rom 10:14).,"'How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed,' antecedent to their calling on him, 'and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard' first?","So then hearing goes before believing, and believing before calling upon God, as he sits on the throne of grace.","Now, believing is to be according to the sound of the beginning of the gospel, which presenteth us, not first with Christ as ascended, but as Christ dying, buried, and risen.","[16] 'For I delivered unto you first of all, that which I also received; how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures' (1 Cor 15:3,4).","I conclude then, as to this, that the order of heaven is, that men wash in the laver of regeneration, to wit, in the blood of Christ, as held forth in the word of the truth of the gospel, which is the ordinance of God; for there sinners, as sinners, or men as unclean, may wash, in order to their approach to God as he sits upon the throne of grace.","And besides, Is it possible that a man that passeth by the doctrine of Christ as dead, should be admitted with acceptance to a just and holy God for life; or that he that slighteth and trampleth under foot the blood of Christ, as shed upon the cross, should be admitted to an interest in Christ, as he is the throne of grace?",It cannot be.,"He must then wash there first, or die--let his profession, or pretended faith, or holiness, be what it will.",For God sees iniquity in all men; nor can all the nitre or soap in the world cause that our iniquity should not be marked before God (Jer 2:22).,'For without shedding of blood is NO remission' (Heb 9:22).,"Nothing that polluteth, that defileth, or that is unclean, must enter into God's sanctuary; much less into the most holy part thereof, but by their sacrifice, by which they are purged, and for the sake of the perfection thereof, they believing are accepted.","We have 'therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,' and no way else (Heb 10:19).",[HOW WE ARE TO APPROACH THE THRONE OF GRACE.],FOURTH.,But this will yet be further manifest by what we have yet to say of the manner of our approach unto the throne of grace.,"FIRST, then, we must approach the throne of grace by the second veil; for the throne of grace is after the second veil.","So, then, though a man cometh into the tabernacle or temple, which was a figure of the church, yet if he entered but within the first veil, he only came where there was no mercy-seat or throne of grace (Heb 9:3).","And what is this second veil, in, at, or through which, as the phrase is, we must, by blood, enter into the holiest?","why, as to the law, the second veil did hang up between the holy and the most holy place, and it did hide what was within the holiest from the eyes or sight of those that went no further than into the first tabernacle.",Now this second veil in the tabernacle or temple was a figure of the second veil that all those must go through that will approach the throne of grace; and that veil is the flesh of Christ.,"This is that which the holy apostle testifies in his exhortation, where he saith, We have 'boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh' (Heb 10:19,20).","The second veil then is the flesh of Christ, the which until a man can enter or go through by his faith, it is impossible that he should come to the holiest where the throne of grace is, that is, to the heart and soul of Jesus, which is the throne.","The body of Christ is the tabernacle of God, and so that in which God dwells; for the fulness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily (Col 2:9).","Therefore, as also has been hinted before, Christ Jesus is the throne of grace.","Now, since his flesh is called the veil, it is evident that the glory that dwells within him, to wit, God resting in him, cannot be understood but by them that by faith can look through, or enter through, his flesh to that glory.","For the glory is within the veil; there is the mercy-seat, or throne of grace; there sitteth God as delighted, as at rest, in and with sinners, that come to him by and through that flesh, and the offering of it for sin without the gate.","'I am the way,' saith Christ; but to what?",and how?,(John 14:6).,"Why, to the Father, through my flesh.","'And having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.","And you that were sometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled [but how?]","in the body of his flesh, [that then must be first: to what?]","to present you holy and unblameable, and unreprovable in his sight' (Col 1:20-22).","That is, when you enter into his presence, or approach by this flesh, the mercy-seat, or the throne of grace.","This therefore is the manner of our coming, if we come aright to the throne of grace for mercy, we must come by blood through his flesh, as through the veil; by which, until you have entered through it, the glory of God, and that he is resolved that grace shall reign, will be utterly hid from your eyes.","I will not say, but by the notion of these things, men may have their whirling fancies,[17] and may create to themselves wild notions and flattering imaginations of Christ, the throne of grace, and of glory; but the gospel knowledge of this is of absolute necessity to my right coming to the throne of grace for mercy.","I must come by his blood, through his flesh, or I cannot come at all, for here is no back door.","This then is the sum, Christ's body is the tabernacle, the holiest; 'thy law,' saith he, 'is within my heart,' or in the midst of my bowels (Psa 40:7,8).","In this tabernacle then God sitteth, to wit, on the heart of Christ, for that is the throne of grace.","Through this tabernacle men must enter, that is, by a godly understanding of what by this tabernacle or flesh of Christ has been done to reconcile us to God that dwells in him.","This is the way, all the way, for there is no way but this to come to the throne of grace.","This is the new way into the heavenly paradise, for the old way is hedged and ditched up by the flaming sword of cherubims (Gen 3:24).","The NEW and LIVING way, for to go the other is present death; so then, this 'new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,' is the only way into the holiest, where the throne of grace is (Heb 10:20).",SECOND.,"We must approach this throne of grace, as having our hearts, first, sprinkled from an evil conscience.","The priest that was the representator of all Israel, when he went into the holiest, was not to go in, but as sprinkled with blood first (Exo 29).",Thus it is written in t he law; 'not without blood'; and thus it is written in the gospel (Heb 9:7).,"And now since by the gospel we have all admittance to enter in through the veil, by faith, we must take heed that we enter not in without blood; for if the blood, virtually, be not seen upon us, we die, instead of obtaining mercy, and finding the help of grace.","This I press the oftener, because there is nothing to which we are more naturally inclined, than to forget this.","Who, that understands himself, is not sensible how apt he is to forget to act faith in the blood of Jesus, and to get his conscience sprinkled with the virtue of that, that attempteth to approach the throne of grace?",Yet the scripture calls upon us to take heed that we neglect not THUS to prepare ourselves.,"'Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,' to wit, with the blood of Christ, lest we die (Heb 10:22, 9:14).","In the law all the people were to be sprinkled with blood, and it was necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these, that is, with the blood of bulls, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these, that is, with the offering of the body, and shedding of the blood of Christ.","By this then must thou be purified and sprinkled, who by Christ wouldst approach the throne of grace.",THIRD.,"Therefore it is added, 'And our bodies washed with pure water.'","This the apostle taketh also out of the law; where it was appointed, as was showed before.","Christ also, just before he went to the Father, gave his disciples a signification of this, saying to Peter, and by him to all the rest, 'If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me' (John 13:8).","This pure water is nothing but the wholesome doctrine of the word mixed with Spirit, by which, as the conscience was before sprinkled with blood, the body and outward conversation is now sanctified and made clean.","'Now ye are clean through the word,' saith Christ, 'which I have spoken unto you' (John 15:3).","Hence, washing, and sanctifying, and justifying, are put together, and are said to come by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God (1 Cor 6:11).","Thou must then be washed with water, and sprinkled with blood, if thou wouldst orderly approach the throne of grace: if thou wouldst orderly approach it with a true heart, in full assurance of faith; or if thou wouldst, as the text biddeth thee here, to wit, 'come boldly unto the throne of grace, to obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'","To tell you what it is to come boldly, is one thing; and to tell you how you should come boldly, is another.","Here you are bid to come boldly, and are also showed how that may be done.","It may be done through the blood of sprinkling, and through the sanctifying operations of the Spirit which are here by faith to be received.","And when what can be said shall be said to the utmost, there is no boldness, godly boldness, but by blood.","The more the conscience is a stranger to the sprinkling of blood, the further off it is of being rightly bold with God, at the throne of grace; for it is the blood that makes the atonement, and that gives boldness to the soul (Lev 17:11; Heb 10:19).","It is the blood, the power of it by faith upon the conscience, that drives away guilt, and so fear, and consequently that begetteth boldness.","Wherefore, he that will be bold with God at the throne of grace, must first be well acquainted with the doctrine of the blood of Christ; namely, that it was shed, and why, and that it has made peace with God, and for whom.","Yea, thou must be able by faith to bring thyself within the number of those that are made partakers of this reconciliation, before thou canst come boldly to the throne of grace.","But, [What it is to come to the throne of grace without boldness.]",First.,"There is a coming to the throne of grace before or without this boldness; but that is not the coming to which by these texts we are exhorted; yet that coming, be it never so deficient, if it is right, it is through some measure an inlet into the death and blood of Christ, and through some management, though but very little, or perhaps scarce at all discerned of the soul, to hope for grace from the throne; I say, it must arise, the encouragement must, from the cross, and from Christ as dying there.","Christ himself went that way to God, and it is not possible but we must go the same way too.","So, then, the encouragement, be it little, be it much--and it is little or much, even as the faith is in strength or weakness, which apprehendeth Christ--it is according to the proportion of faith; strong faith gives great boldness, weak faith doth not so, nor can it.",Second.,"There is a sincere coming to the throne of grace without this boldness, even a coming in the uprightness of one's heart without it.",Hence a true heart and full assurance are distinguished.,"'Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith' (Heb 10:22).","Sincerity may be attended with a great deal of weakness, even as boldness may be attended with pride; but be it what kind of coming to the throne of grace it will, either a coming with boldness, or with that doubting which is incident to saints, still the cause of that coming, or ground thereof, is some knowledge of redemption by blood, redemption which the soul seeth it has faith in, or would see it has faith in.","For Christ is precious, sometimes in the sight of the worth, sometimes in the sight of the want, and sometimes in the sight of the enjoyment of him.",[18] Third.,There is an earnest coming to the throne of grace even with all the desire of one's soul.,"When David had guilt and trouble, and that so heavy that he knew not what to do, yet he could say, 'Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee' (Psa 38:1-9).",He could come earnestly to the throne of grace; he could come thither with all the desire of his soul: but still this must be from that knowledge that he had of the way of remission of sins by the blood of the Son of God.,Fourth.,There is also a constant coming to the throne of grace.,"'Lord,' said Heman, 'I have cried day and night before thee, let my prayer come before thee, incline thine ear unto my cry, for my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave' (Psa 88:1-3).","Here you see is constant crying before the throne of grace, crying night and day; and yet the man that cries seems to be in a very black cloud, and to find hard work to bear up in his soul; yet this he had, namely, the knowledge of how God was the God of salvation; yea, he called him his God as such, though with pretty much difficulty of spirit, to be sure.","Wherefore it must not be concluded, that they come not at all to the throne of grace, that come not with a full assurance; or that men must forbear to come, till they come with assurance; but this I say, they come not at all aright, that take not the ground of their coming from the death and blood of Christ; and that they that come to the throne of grace, with but little knowledge of redemption by blood, will come with but little hope of obtaining grace and mercy to help in time of need.","I conclude then, that it is the privilege, the duty and glory of a man, to approach the throne of grace as a prince, as Job said, could he but find it, he would be sure to do.",'O that I knew where I might find him!',"saith he, 'that I might come even to his seat: I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments: I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.",Will he plead against me with his great power?,No; but he would put strength in me.,There the righteous might dispute with him: so should I be delivered for ever from my judge' (23:3-7).,"Indeed, God sometimes tries us.","'He holdeth back,' sometimes, 'the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it' (Job 26:9).","And this seems to be Job's case here, which made him to confess he was at a loss, and to cry out, 'O that I knew where I might find him!'","And this he doth for trial, and to prove our honesty and constancy; for the hypocrite will not pray always.",Will he always call upon God?,"No, verily; especially not when thou bindest them, afflictest them, and makest praying hard work to them (Job 36:13).","But difficulty as to finding of God's presence, and the sweet shining of the face of his throne, doth not always lie in the weakness of faith.","Strong faith may be in this perplexity, and may be hard put to it to stand at times.","It is said here, that God did hold back the face of his throne, and did spread a cloud upon it; not to weaken Job's faith, but to try Job's strength, and to show to men of after ages how valiant a man Job was.","Faith, if it be strong, will play the man in the dark; will, like a mettled horse, flounce in bad way, will not be discouraged at trials, at many or strong trials: 'Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him,' is the language of that invincible grace of God (Job 13:15).","There is also an aptness in those that come to the throne of grace, to cast all degrees of faith away, that carrieth not in its bowels self-evidence of its own being and nature, thinking that if it be faith, it must be known to the soul; yea, if it be faith, it will do so and so: even so as the highest degrees of faith will do.","When, alas!","faith is sometimes in a calm, sometimes up, and sometimes down, and sometimes at it with sin, death, and the devil, as we say, blood up to the ears.","[19] Faith now has but little time to speak peace to the conscience; it is now struggling for life, it is now fighting with angels, with infernals; all it can do now, is to cry, groan, sweat, fear, fight, and gasp for life.","[20] Indeed the soul should now run to the cross, for there is the water, or rather the blood and water, that is provided for faith, as to the maintaining of the comfort of justification; but the soul whose faith is thus attacked will find hard work to do this, though much of the well-managing of faith, in the good fight of faith, will lie in the soul's hearty and constant adhering to the death and blood of Christ; but a man must do as he can.","Thus now have I showed you the manner of right coming to the throne of grace, for mercy and grace to help in time of need.",[None but the godly know the throne of grace.],"The next thing that I am to handle, is, first, To show you, that it is the privilege of the godly to distinguish from all thrones whatsoever this throne of grace.","This, as I told you, I gathered from the apostle in the text, for that he only maketh mention thereof, but gives no sign to distinguish it by; no sign, I say, though he knew that there were more thrones than it.","'Let us come boldly,' saith he, 'to the throne of grace,' and so leaves it, knowing full well that they had a good understanding of his meaning, being Hebrews (Heb 9:1-8).","They being now also enlightened from what they were taught by the placing of the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat in the most holy place; of which particular the apostle did then count it, not of absolute necessity distinctly to discourse.","Indeed the Gentiles, as I have showed, have this throne of grace described and set forth before them, by those tokens which I have touched upon in the sheets that go before--for with the book of Revelation the Gentiles are particularly concerned--for that it was writ to churches of the Gentiles; also the great things prophesied of there relate unto Gentile-believers, and to the downfall of Antichrist, as he standeth among them.","But yet, I think that John's discourse of the things attending the throne of grace were not by him so much propounded, because the Gentiles were incapable of finding of it without such description, as to show the answerableness of the antitype with the type; and also to strengthen their faith, and illustrate the thing; for they that know, may know more, and better of what they know; yea, may be greatly comforted with another's dilating on what they know.","Besides, the Holy Ghost by the word doth always give the most perfect description of things; wherefore to that we should have recourse for the completing of our knowledge.","I mean not, by what I say, in the least to intimate, as if this throne of grace was to be known without the text, for it is that that giveth revelation of Jesus Christ: but my meaning is, that a saint, as such, has such a working of things upon his heart, as makes him able by the Word to find out this throne of grace, and to distinguish it to himself from others.","For, First.","The saint has strong guilt of sin upon his conscience, especially at first; and this makes him better judge what grace, in the nature of grace, is, than others can that are not sensible of what guilt is.","What it was to be saved, was better relished by the jailor when he was afraid of and trembled at the apprehensions of the wrath of God, than ever it was with him all his life before (Acts 16:29-33).","Peter then also saw what saving was, when he began to sink into the sea: 'Lord, save me,' said he, I perish (Matt 14:30).",Sin is that without a sense of which a man is not apprehensive what grace is.,"Sin and grace, favour and wrath, death and life, hell and heaven, are opposites, and are set off, or out, in their evil or good, shame or glory, one by another.",What makes grace so good to us as sin in its guilt and filth?,"What makes sin so horrible and damnable a thing in our eyes, as when we see there is nothing can save us from it but the infinite grace of God?","Further, there seems, if I may so term it, to be a kind of natural instinct in the new creature to seek after the grace of God; for so saith the Word, 'They that are after the flesh, do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit' (Rom 8:5).",The child by nature nuzzles in its mother's bosom for the breast; the child by grace does by grace seek to live by the grace of God.,"All creatures, the calf, the lamb, &c., so soon as they are fallen from their mother's belly, will by nature look for, and turn themselves towards the teat, and the new creature doth so too (1 Peter 2:1-3).","For guilt makes it hunger and thirst, as the hunted hart does pant after the water brooks.","Hunger directs to bread, thirst directs to water; yea, it calls bread and water to mind.","Let a man be doing other business, hunger will put him in mind of his cupboard, and thirst of his cruse of water; yea, it will call him, make him, force him, command him, to bethink what nourishing victuals is, and will also drive him to search out after where he may find it, to the satisfying of himself.","All right talk also to such an one sets the stomach and appetite a craving; yea, into a kind of running out of the body after this bread and water, that it might be fed, nourished, and filled therewith.","Thus it is by nature, and thus it is by grace; thus it is for the bread that perisheth, and for that which endureth to everlasting life.","But, Second.","As nature, the new nature, teaches this by a kind of heavenly natural instinct; so experience also herein helpeth the godly much.","For they have found all other places, the throne of grace excepted, empty, and places or things that hold no water.","They have been at Mount Sinai for help, but could find nothing there but fire and darkness, but thunder and lightning, but earthquake and trembling, and a voice of killing words, which words they that heard them once could never endure to hear them again; and as for the sight of vengeance there revealed against sin, it was so terrible, that Moses, even Moses, said, 'I exceedingly fear and quake' (Heb 12:18-21; Exo 19; 2 Cor 3).",They have sought for grace by their own performances; but alas!,"they have yielded them nothing but wind and confusion; not a performance, not a duty, not an act in any part of religious worship, but they looking upon it in the glass of the Lord, do find it spaked[21] and defective (Isa 64:5-8).","They have sought for grace by their resolutions, their vows, their purposes, and the like; but alas!","they all do as the other, discover that they have been very imperfectly managed, and so such as can by no means help them to grace.","They have gone to their tears, their sorrow, and repentance, if perhaps they might have found some help there; but all has either fled away like the early dew, or if they have stood, they have stunk even in the nostrils of those whose they were.","How much more, then, in the nostrils of a holy God!","They have gone to God, as the great Creator, and have beheld how wonderful his works have been; they have looked to the heavens above, to the earth beneath, and to all their ornaments, but neither have these, nor what is of [or resulting from] them, yielded grace to those that had sensible want thereof.","Thus have they gone, as I said, with these pitchers to their fountains, and have returned empty and ashamed; they found no water, no river of water of life; they have been as the woman with her bloody issue, spending and spending till they have spent all, and been nothing better, but rather grew worse (Mark 5).","Had they searched into nothing but the law, it had been sufficient to convince them that there was no grace, nor throne of grace, in the world.","For since the law, being the most excellent of all the things of the earth, is found to be such as yieldeth no grace--for grace and truth comes by Jesus Christ, not by Moses (John 1:17)--how can it be imagined that it should be found in anything inferior?","Paul, therefore, not finding it in the law, despairs to find it in anything else below, but presently betakes himself to look for it there where he had not yet sought it--for he sometimes sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law (Phil 3:6-8)--he looked for it, I say, by Jesus Christ, who is the throne of grace, where he found it, and rejoiced in hope of the glory of God (Rom 9:29-31, 5:1-3).","But, Third.","Saints come to know and distinguish the throne of grace from other thrones, by the very direction of God himself; as it is said of the well that the nobles digged in the wilderness--they digged it by the direction of the lawgiver, so saints find out the throne of grace by the direction of the grace-giver.","Hence Paul prays, that the Lord would direct the hearts of the people into the love of God (2 Thess 3:5).","Man, as man, cannot aim directly at this throne; but will drop his prayers short, besides, or the like, if he be not helped by the Spirit (Rom 8:26).","Hence the Son saith of himself, 'No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him' (John 6:44).","Which text doth not only justify what is now said, but insinuates that there is an unwillingness in man of himself to come to this throne of grace; he must be drawn thereto.","He setteth us in the way of his steps, that is, in that way to the throne by which grace and mercy is conveyed unto us.",Fourth.,"We know the throne of grace from other thrones, by the glory that it always appears in, when revealed to us of God: its glory outbids all; there is no such glory to be seen anywhere else, either in heaven or earth.","But, I say, this comes by the sight that God gives, not by any excellency that there is in my natural understanding as such; my understanding and apprehension, simply as natural, is blind and foolish.","Wherefore, when I set to work in mine own spirit, and in the power of mine own abilities, to reach to this throne of grace, and to perceive somewhat of the glory thereof, then am I dark, rude, foolish, see nothing; and my heart grows fat, dull, savourless, lifeless, and has no warmth in the duty.","But it mounts up with wings like an eagle, when the throne is truly apprehended.",Therefore that is another thing by which the Christian knows the throne of grace from all others; it meets with that good there that it can meet with nowhere else.,But at present let these things suffice for this.,[MOTIVES FOR COMING BOLDLY TO THE THRONE OF GRACE.],FIFTH.,"I come now to the motives by which the apostle stirreth up the Hebrews, and encourageth them to come boldly to the throne of grace.",FIRST.,"The first is, because we have there such an high priest, or an high priest so and so qualified.",SECOND.,"Because we that come thither for grace are sure there to speed, or find grace and obtain it.","[The first motive, because we have such an high priest there.]",FIRST.,"For the fist of these, to wit, we have an encouragement to move us to come with boldness to the throne of grace, because we have an high priest there; because we have such an high priest there.","'For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.",Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace.',"Of this high priest I have already made mention before, to wit, so far as to show you that Christ Jesus is he, as well as he is the altar, and sacrifice, and throne of grace, before which he also himself makes intercession.","But forasmuch as by the apostle here, he is not only presented unto us as a throne of grace, but as an high priest ministering before it, it will not be amiss if I do somewhat particularly treat of his priesthood also.","But the main or chief of my discourse will be to treat of his qualifications to his office, which I find to be in general of two sorts.",I.,LEGAL.,II.,NATURAL.,[THE LEGAL qualifications of Jesus Christ for the office of high priest.],I.,LEGAL.,"When I say legal, I mean, as the apostle's expression is, not by 'the law of a carnal commandment,' but by an eternal covenant, and 'the power of an endless life' thereby; of which the priesthood of old was but a type, and the law of their priesthood but a shadow (Heb 7:16, 9:15,24).","But because their law, and their entrance into their priesthood thereby, was, as I said, 'a shadow of good things to come,' therefore where it will help to illustrate, we will make use thereof so to do; and where not, there we will let it pass (Heb 10:1).","The thing to be now spoken to is, that the consideration of Jesus Christ being an high priest before the throne of grace, is a motive and encouragement to us to come boldly thither for grace: 'Seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession,' and 'come boldly unto the throne of grace' (Heb 4:14,16).","Now, how he was made an high priest; for so is the expression, 'made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec' (Heb 6;20).",First.,He took not his honour upon himself without a lawful call thereto.,Thus the priests under the law were put into office; and thus the Son of God.,"No man taketh this honour to himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.","So also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest, but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.","Wherefore he was 'called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec' (Heb 5:4-6,10).","Thus far, therefore, the law of his priesthood answereth to the law of the priesthood of old; they both were made priests by a legal call to their work or office.","But yet the law by which this Son was made high priest excelleth, and that in these particulars-- 1.","He was made a priest after the similitude of Melchisedec, for he testifieth, 'Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec' (Heb 7:17).","Thus they under the law were not made priests but after the order of Aaron, that is, by a carnal commandment, not by an everlasting covenant of God.",2.,"And, saith he, 'inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest, for those priests were made without an oath, but this with an oath, by him that said unto him, The Lord sware, and will not repent, thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec' (Heb 7:20,21).",3.,"The priesthood under the law, with their law and sacrifices, were fading, and were not suffered to continue, by reason of the death of the priest, and ineffectualness of his offering (Heb 7:23).","'But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood' (v 24).","'For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity, but the word of the oath which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore' (v 28).","From what hath already been said, we gather, (1.)",What kind of person it is that is our high priest.,(2.),"The manner of his being called to, and stated[22] in that office.",(1.),What manner of person he is.,"He is the Son, the Son of God, Jesus the Son of God.","Hence the apostle saith, 'we have a great high priest,' such an high priest 'that is passed into the heavens' (Heb 4:14).",Such an high priest as is 'made higher than the heavens' (Heb 7:26).,"And why doth he thus dilate upon the dignity of his person, but because thereby is insinuated the excellency of his sacrifice, and the prevalency of his intercession, by that, to God for us.","Therefore he saith again, 'Every' Aaronical 'priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: but this man,' this great man, this Jesus, this Son of God, 'after he had offered one,' one only, one once, but one (Heb 9:25,26), 'sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.",For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified' (Heb 10:11-14).,"Thus, I say, the apostle toucheth upon the greatness of his person, thereby to set forth the excellency of his sacrifice, and prevalency of his intercession.","'Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession, Christ Jesus' (Heb 3:1).","Or, as he saith again, making mention of Melchisedec, 'consider how great this man was' (Heb 7:4), we have such a high priest, so great a high priest; one that is entered into the heavens: Jesus the Son of God.",(2.),"The manner also of his being called to and stated in his office, is not to be overlooked.","He is made a priest after the power of an endless life, or is to be such an one as long as he lives, and as long as we have need of his mediation.","Now Christ being raised from the dead, dies no more; death hath no more dominion over him.",He is himself the Prince of life.,"Wherefore it follows, 'he hath an unchangeable priesthood.'",And what then?,"Why, then 'he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them' (Heb 7:24,25).","But again, he is made a priest with an oath, 'the Lord sware, and will not repent, thou art a priest for ever.'","Hence I gather, (a) That before God there is no high priest but Jesus, nor ever shall be.",(b) That God is to the full pleased with his high priesthood; and so with all those for whom he maketh intercession.,"For this priest, though he is not accepted for the sake of another, yet he is upon the account of another.","'For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God,' to make reconciliation for the sins of the people (Heb 5:1,2).","And again, he is entered 'into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us' (Heb 9:24).","God therefore, in that he hath made him a priest with an oath, and also determined that he will never repent of his so doing, declareth that he is, and for ever will be, satisfied with his offering.","And this is a great encouragement to those that come to God by him; they have by this oath a firm ground to go upon, and the oath is, 'Thou art a priest for ever,' shalt be accepted for ever for every one for whom thou makest intercession; nor will I ever reject any body that comes to me by thee; therefore here is ground for faith, for hope and rejoicing; for this consideration a man has ground to come boldly to the throne of grace.",Second.,"But again, as Christ is made a priest by call and with an oath, and so, so far legally; so he, being thus called, has other preparatory legal qualifications.","The High Priest under the law was not by law to come into the holiest, but in those robes that were ordained for him to minister in before God; which robes were not to be made according to the fancy of the people, but according to the commandment of Moses (Exo 28).","Christ our high priest in heaven has also his holy garment, with which he covereth the nakedness of them that are his, which robe was not made of corruptible things, as silver and gold, &c., but by a patient continuance in a holy life, according to the law of Moses, both moral and ceremonial.","Not that either of these were that eternal testament by which he was made a priest; but the moral law was to be satisfied, and the types of the ceremonial law to be as to this eminently fulfilled; and he was bound by that eternal covenant by which he is made a mediator to do so.","Wherefore, before he could enter the holiest of all, he must have these holy garments made; neither did he trust others, as in the case of Aaron, to make these garments for him, but he wrought them all himself, according to all that Moses commanded.",This garment Christ was a great while a-making.,"What time, you may ask, was required?","And I answer, All the days of his life; for all things that were written concerning him, as to this, were not completed till the day that he hanged upon the cross.","For then it was that he said, 'It is finished; and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost' (John 19:28-30).",This robe is for glory and for beauty.,"This is it that afore I said was of the colour of the rainbow, and that compasseth even round about this throne of grace, unto which we are bid to come.","This is that garment that reaches down to his feet, and that is girt to him with a golden girdle (Rev 1:13).","This is that garment that covereth all his body mystical, and that hideth the blemishes of such members from the eye of God, and of the law.","And it is made up of his obedience to the law, by his complete perfect obedience thereto (Rom 5:19).","This Christ wears always, he never puts it off, as the [former] high priests put off theirs by a ceremonial command.",He ever lives to make intercession; consequently he ever wears this priestly robe.,"He might not go into the holy place without it, upon danger of death, or at least of being sent back again; but he died not, but lives ever; is not sent back, but is set down at God's right hand; and there shall sit till his foes are made his footstool (John 16:10).","This is that for the sake of which all are made welcome, and embraced and kissed, forgiven and saved, that come unto God by him.","This is that righteousness, that mantle spotless, that Paul so much desired to be found wrapt in; for he knew that being found in that he must be presented thereby to God a glorious man, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.","This therefore is another of the Lord Jesus' legal qualifications, as preparatory to the executing of his high priest's office in heaven.",But of this something has been spoken before; and therefore I shall not enlarge upon it here.,Third.,"When the high priest under the law was thus accomplished by a legal call, and a garment suitable to his office, then again there was another thing that must be done, in order to his regular execution of his office; and that was, he must be consecrated, and solemnly ushered thereunto by certain offerings, first presented to God for himself.","This you have mention made of in the Levitical law; you have there first commanded, that, in order to the high priest's approaching the holiest for the people, there must first be an offering of consecration for himself, and this is to succeed his call, and the finishing of his holy garments (Exo 29:5-7,19-22).","For this ceremony was not to be observed until his garments were made and put upon him; also the blood of the ram of consecration was to be sprinkled upon him, his garments, &c., that he might be hallowed, and rightly set apart for the high priest's office (Lev 8).","The Holy Ghost, I think, thus signifying that Jesus the Son of God, our great high priest, was not only to sanctify the people with his blood; but first, by blood must to that work be sanctified himself; 'For their sakes,' saith he, 'I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth' (John 17:19).","But it may be asked, When was this done to Christ, or what sacrifice of consecration had he precedent to the offering up of himself for our sins?","I answer, It was done in the garden when he was washed in his own blood, when his sweat was in great drops of blood, falling down to the ground.","For there it was he was sprinkled with his blood, not only the tip of his ear, his thumb, and toe, but there he was washed all over; there therefore was his most solemn consecration to his office; at least, so I think.","And this, as Aaron's was, was done by Moses; it was Moses that sprinkled Aaron's garments.","It was by virtue of an agony also that his bloody sweat was produced; and what was the cause of that agony, but the apprehension of the justice and curse of Moses' law, which now he was to undergo for the sins of the people.","With this sacrifice he then subjoined another, which was also preparatory to the great acts of his high priest's office, which he was afterwards to perform for us.","And that was his drink-offering, his tears, which were offered to God with strong cries (Exo 29:40; Num 28:7).","For this was the place and time that in a special manner he caused his strong wine to be poured out, and that he drank his tears as water.","This is called his offering, his offering for his own acceptance with God.","After 'he had offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him,' he 'was heard' for his piety, for his acceptance as to this office, for he merited his office as well as his people (Heb 5:7).","Wherefore it follows, 'and being made perfect,' that is, by a complete performance of all that was necessary for the orderly attaining of his office as high priest, 'he became the author of eternal salvation, unto all them that obey him' (Heb 5:9).","For your better understanding of me as to this, mind that I speak of a twofold perfection in Christ; one as to his person, the other as to his performances.","In the perfection of his person, two things are to be considered; first, the perfection of his humanity, as to the nature of it; it was at first appearing, wholly without pollution of sin, and so completely perfect; but yet this humanity was to have joined to this another perfection; and that was a perfection of stature and age.","Hence it is said that as to his humanity he increased, that is, grew more perfect.","For this his increasing was, in order to a perfection, not of nature, simply as nature, but of stature.",'Jesus increased in wisdom and stature' (Luke 2:52).,"The paschal lamb was a lamb the first day it was yeaned; but it was not to be sacrificed until it attained such a perfection of age as by the law of God was appointed to it (Exo 12:5,6).","It was necessary, therefore, that Christ as to his person should be perfect in both these senses.",And indeed 'in due time Christ died for the ungodly' (Rom 5:6).,"Again, as there was a perfection of person, or of nature and personage in Christ, so there was to be a perfection of performances in him also.","Hence it is said, that Jesus increased in favour with God (Luke 2:52); that is, by perfecting of his obedience to him for us.","Now, his performances were such as had a respect to his bringing in of righteousness for us in the general; or such as respected preparations for his sacrifice as a high priest.","But let them be applied to both, or to this or that in particular; it cannot be, that while the most part of his performances were wanting, he should be as perfect as when he said, 'The things concerning me have an end' (Luke 22:37).","Not but that every act of his obedience was perfect, and carried in it a length and breadth proportionable to that law by which it was demanded.",Nor was there at any time in his obedience that which made to interfere one commandment with another.,"He did all things well, and so stood in the favour of God.","But yet one act was not actually all, though virtually any one of his actions might carry in it a merit sufficient to satisfy and quiet the law.","Hence, as I said, it is told us, not only that he is the Son of God's love, but that he increased in favour with God; that is, by a going on in doing, by a continuing to do that always that pleased the God of heaven.","A man that pays money at the day appointed, beginning first at one shilling, or one pound, and so ceaseth not until he hath in current coin told over the whole sum to the creditor, does well at the beginning; but the first shilling, or first pound, not being the full debt, cannot be counted or reckoned the whole, but a part; yet is it not an imperfect part, nor doth the creditor find fault at all, because there is but so much now told; but concludes that all is at hand, and accepteth of this first, as a first-fruits: so Christ, when he came into the world, began to pay, and so continued to do, even until he had paid the whole debt, and so increased in favour with God.","There was then a gradual performance of duties, as to the number of them, by our Lord when he was in the world, and consequently a time wherein it might be said that Christ had not, as to act, done all, as was appointed him to do, to do as preparatory to that great thing which he was to do for us.","Wherefore, in conclusion, he is said to be made perfect, 'and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him' (Heb 5:9).","It will be objected, then, that at some time it might be said of Christ that he was imperfect in his obedience.",Answ.,"There was a time wherein it might have been said, Christ had not done all that he was to do for us on earth.","But it doth not follow thereupon, that he therefore was imperfect in his obedience; for that all his acts of obedience were done in their proper time, and when they should, according to the will of God.","The timing of performances adds or diminishes as to the perfection of obedience, or the imperfection of it.","Had these Jews killed the passover three days sooner than the time appointed, they had transgressed (Exo 12:6).","Had the Jews done that on the fourth day to Jericho, which was to have been done on the seventh day, they had sinned (Josh 6:10-16).","Duty is beautiful in its time, and the Son of God observed the time.","'I must,' saith he, 'work the works of him that sent me, while it is day,' that is, in their seasons.","You must keep in mind that we speak all this while of that part of Christ's perfection, as to duties, which stood in the number of performances, and not in the nature or quality of acts.","And I say, as to the thing in hand, Christ had duty to do, with respect to his office as high priest for us, which immediately concerned himself; such duties as gave him a legal admittance unto the execution thereof; such duties, the which, had they not orderly been done, the want of them would have made him an undue approacher of the presence of God, as to that.","Wherefore, as I said afore, by what he did thereabout, he consecrated, or sanctified himself for that work, according to God, and was accepted for his piety, or in that he feared and did orderly do what he should do.",Fourth.,The next thing preparatory to the execution of this office of high priest was the sacrifice itself.,"The sacrifice, you know, must, as to the being of it, needs precede the offering of it; it must be before it can be offered.","Nor could Christ have been an high priest, had he not had a sacrifice to offer.",'For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices; wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer' (Heb 8:3).,"And I bring in the sacrifice as the last thing preparatory, not that it was last, as to being, for it was before he could be capable of doing any of the afore-named duties, being his body, in and by which he did them, but it was the last as to fitness; it was not to be a sacrifice before the time, the time appointed of the Father; for since he had prepared it to that end, it was fit as to the time of its being offered, that that should be when God thought best also (Heb 10:5).","Behold then, here is the high priest with his sacrifice; and behold again, how he comes to offer it.","He comes to offer his burnt-offering at the call of God; he comes to do it in his priestly garments, consecrated and sanctified in his own blood; he comes with blood and tears, or by water and blood, and offereth his sacrifice, himself a sacrifice unto God for the sin of the world; and that too at a time when God began to be weary of the service and sacrifices of all the world.","'Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me,' thou hast fitted me; 'in burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure; then said I, Lo I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God' (Heb 10:5-7).","[Christ the sacrifice as well as the high priest, and how he offered it.]","Thus you see our high priest proceeded to the execution of his priestly office; and now we are come to his sacrifice, we will consider a little of the parts thereof, and how he offered, and pleads the same.","The burnt-offering for sin had two parts, the flesh and the fat, which fat is called the fat of the inwards, of the kidneys, and the like (Lev 3:12-16).","Answerable to this, the sacrifice of Christ had two parts, the body and the soul.","The body is the flesh, and his soul the fat; that inward part that must not by any means be kept from the fire (Isa 53:10).","For without the burning of the fat, the burnt-offering and sin-offering, both which was a figure of the sacrifice of our high priest, was counted imperfect, and so not acceptable.","And it is observable, that in these kind of offerings, when they were to be burned, the fat and the head must be laid and be burned together; and the priest 'shall cut it into his pieces with his head and his fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar' (Lev 1:12).","To signify, methinks, the feeling sense that this sacrifice of his body and soul should have of the curse of God due to sin, all the while that it suffered for sin.","And therefore it is from this that this sacrifice has the name of burnt-offering, it is the burnt-offering for the burning, because of the burning upon the altar all night, until the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.","The fat made the flame to increase and to ascend; wherefore God speaks affectionately of the fat, saying, The fat of mine offerings.","And again, 'He shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied' (Isa 53:10-12).","The soul-groans, the soul-cries, the soul-conflicts that the Son of God had, together with his soul-submission to his Father's will, when he was made a sacrifice for sin, did doubtless flame bright, ascend high, and cast out a sweet savour unto the nostrils of God, whose justice was now appeasing for the sin of men.","His flesh also was part of this sacrifice, and was made to feel that judgment of God for sin that it was capable of.","And it was capable of feeling much, so long as natural life, and so, bodily sense, remained.","It also began to feel with the soul, by reason of the union that was betwixt them both; the soul felt, and the body bled; the soul was in an agony, and the body sweat blood; the soul wrestled with the judgment and curse of the law, and the body, to show its sense and sympathy, sent out dolorous cries, and poured out rivers of tears before God.","We will not here at large speak of the lashes, of the crown of thorns, of how his face was bluft[23] with blows and blood; also how he was wounded, pierced, and what pains he felt while life lasted, as he suffered for our sins; though these things are also prefigured in the old law, by the nipping or wringing of the head, the cutting of the sacrifice in pieces, and burning it in the fire (Lev 1).","Now, you must know, that as the high priest was to offer his sacrifice, so he was to bring the blood thereof to the mercy-seat or throne of grace, where now our Jesus is; he was to offer it at the door of the tabernacle, and to carry the blood within the veil; of both which a little.",[Christ a willing and an effectual sacrifice.],1.,"He was to offer it, and how?","Not grudgingly, nor as by compulsion, but of a voluntary will and cheerful mind: 'If his offering be a burnt-sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it of his own voluntary will' (Lev 1:3).","Thus did Christ when he offered up himself, as is manifest by that which follows.",(1.),"He offered a male, 'himself,' without blemish (Heb 7:27).",(2.),He gave himself a ransom; he 'gave his life a ransom' (Matt 20;28).,(3.),He laid down his life of himself (John 10:18; Luke 12:5).,(4.),"He longed for the day of his death, that he might die to redeem his people.",(5.),"Nor was he ever so joyful in all his life, that we read of, as when his sufferings grew near; then he takes the sacrament of his body and blood into his own hands, and with thanksgiving bestows it among his disciples; then he sings an hymn, then he rejoices, then he comes with a 'Lo, I come.'","O the heart, the great heart, that Jesus Christ had for us to do us good!",He did it with all the desire of his soul.,2.,"He did it, not only voluntarily, and of a free will, but of love and affection to the life of his enemies.","Had he done thus for the life of his friends, it had been much; but since he did it out of love to the life of his enemies, that is much more.","'Scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die; but God commended his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us' (Rom 5:7,8).",3.,"He did it without relinquishment of mind, when he was in: no discouragement disheartened him; cry and bleed he did, yea, roar by reason of the troubles of his soul, but his mind was fixed; his Father sware and did not repent, that he should be his priest; and he vowed, and said he would not repent that he had threatened to be the plague and death of death (Hosea 13:13,14).",4.,"He did it effectually and to purpose: he hath stopped the mouth of the law with blood; he hath so pacified justice, that it now can forgive; he hath carried sin away from before the face of God, and set us quit in his sight; he hath destroyed the devil, abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel; he hath wrought such a change in the world by what he has done for them that believe, that all things work together for their good, from thenceforward and for ever.",[Christ the altar.],"I should now come to the second part of the office of this high-priest, and speak to that; as also to those things that were preparatory unto his executing it; but first, I think convenient a little to treat of the altar also upon which this sacrifice was offered to God.","Some, I conceive, have thought the altar to be the cross on which the body of Christ was crucified, when he gave himself an offering for sin; but they are greatly deceived, for he also himself was the altar through which he offered himself; and this is one of the treasures of wisdom which are hid in him, and of which the world and Antichrist are utterly ignorant.","I touched this in one hint before, but now a little more express.","The altar is always greater than the gift; and since the gift was the body and soul of Christ--for so saith the text, 'He gave himself for our sins'--the altar must be something else than a sorry bit of wood, or than a cursed tree.","Wherefore I will say to such, as one wiser than Solomon said to the Jews, when they superstitiated the gift, in counting it more honourable than the altar, 'Ye fools, and blind, for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?'","(Matt 23:18,19).","If the altar be greater than the gift, and yet the gift so great a thing as the very humanity of Christ, can it--I will now direct my speech to the greatest fool--can that greater thing be the cross?","Is, was the cross, the wooden cross, the cursed tree, that some worship, greater than the gift, to wit, than the sacrifice which Christ offered, when he gave himself for our sins!","O idolatry, O blasphemy!",[24] Quest.,But what then was the altar?,Answ.,"The divine nature of Christ, that Eternal Spirit, by and in the assistance of which he 'offered himself without spot to God'; he, through the Eternal Spirit 'offered himself' (Heb 9:14).",1.,"And it must be THAT, because, as was said, the altar is greater than the gift; but there is nothing but Christ's divine nature greater than his human; to be sure, a sorry bit of wood, a tree, the stock of a tree, is not.",2.,"It must be this, because the text says plainly 'the altar sanctifies the gift,' that is, puts worth and virtue into it; but was it the tree, or the Godhead of Christ, that put virtue and efficacy into this sacrifice that he offered to God for us?","If thou canst but tell thy fingers, judge.",3.,"The altar was it of old that was to bear up the sacrifice until it was consumed; and with reference to the sacrifice under consideration, the tree could not bear up that; for our sacrifice being a man, consisting of soul and body, that which could bear him up in his suffering condition, must be that that could apply itself to his reasonable and sensible part for relief and succour, and that was of power to keep him even in his spirit, and in a complete submissiveness to God, in the present condition in which he was; and could the tree do this, think you?","Had the tree that command and government of the soul and sense of Christ, of the reason and feeling of the Lord Jesus, as to keep him in this bitter suffering, in that evenness and spotlessness in his torment, as to cause that he should come off this great work, without the least smell or tang[25] of imperfection?","No, no; it was through the Eternal Spirit that he 'offered himself without spot to God.'",Quest.,Wherefore then served the cross?,Answ.,"I ask, and wherefore then served the wood by which the sacrifices were burned?","The sacrifices were burned with wood upon the altar; the wood then was not that altar, the wood was that instrument by which the sacrifice was consumed, and the cross that by which Christ suffered his torment and affliction.","The altar then was it that did bear both the wood and sacrifice, that did uphold the wood to burn, and the sacrifice to abide the burning.","And with reference to the matter in hand, the tree on which Christ was hanged, and the sacrifice of his body, were both upheld by his divine power; yet the tree was no more a sacrifice, nor an altar, than was the wood upon the altar; nor was the wood, but the fire, holy, by which the sacrifice was consumed.","Let the tree then be the tree, the sacrifice the sacrifice, and the altar the altar; and let men have a care how, in their worship, they make altars upon which, as they pretend, they offer the body of Christ; and let them leave off foolishly to dote upon wood, and the works of their hands: the altar is greater than the gift or sacrifice that was, or is, upon it.",[How Christ executes the office of high-priest.],We come now to the second part of the office of this high-priest and to show how he performeth that.,"In order to which, I must, as I did with reference to the first, show you what things, as preparatory, were to precede the execution of it.","We have here, as you see, 'our passover sacrificed for us,' for our encouragement to come to the throne of grace; and now let us look to it, as it is presented in the holiest of all, and to the order of its being so presented.",1.,"First, then, before there was anything further done, I mean by this high-priest, as to a further application of his offering, the judgment of God was waited for by him, with respect to his estimation of what was already done, to wit, how that was resented[26] by him; the which he declared to the full by raising him from the dead.","For in that he was raised from the dead, when yet he died for our sins, it is evident that his offering was accepted, or esteemed of value sufficient to effect that for the which it was made a sacrifice, which was for our sins; this, therefore, was in order to his being admitted into heaven.","God, by raising him from the dead, justified his death, and counted it sufficient for the saving of the world.","And this Christ knew would be the effect of his death, long before he gave himself a ransom; where he saith, 'This also shall please the Lord better than an ox, or bullock that hath horns and hoofs' (Psa 69:31).","And again, 'For the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know I shall not be ashamed.",He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me?,Let us stand together; who is mine adversary?,Let him come near to me.,"Behold, the Lord God will help me; who is he that shall condemn me?","Lo, they all shall wax old as a garment, the moth shall eat them up' (Isa 50:7-9).","All this is the work of the Lord God, his Father, and he had faith therein, as I said before.","And since it was God who was to be appeased, it was requisite that he should be heard in the matter, to wit, whether he was pacified or no: the which he has declared, I say, in raising him up from the dead.","And this the apostles, both Paul and Peter, insinuate, when they ascribe his resurrection to the power of another, rather than to his raising of himself, saying, 'this Jesus hath God raised up' (Acts 2:32).","'God hath raised' him up 'from the dead' (3:15), 'whom God raised from the dead,' and the like (4:10, 5:30, 8:56, 13:30).","I say, therefore, that God, by raising up Christ from the dead, hath said, that thus far his offering pleased him, and that he was content.",2.,"But lest the world, being besotted by sin, should not rightly interpret actions, therefore God added to his raising him up from the dead, a solemn exposing of him to view, not to all men, but to such as were faithful, and that might be trusted with the communicating of it to others: 'Him,' saith Peter, 'God raised' from the dead, 'and showed him openly, not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before of God, even to us who did eat and drink with him, after he rose from the dead' (Acts 10:40,41).","And this was requisite, not for that it added anything to the value and worth of his sacrifice, but for the help of the faith of them that were to have eternal salvation by him.","And it is for this cause that Paul so enlargeth upon this very thing, to wit, that there were them that could testify that God had raised him up from the dead, namely, that men might see that God was well pleased, and that they had encouragement to come boldly by him to the throne of grace for mercy (1 Cor 15:1-8).","And this exposing of him to view, was not for the length of a surprising or dazzling moment, but days and nights, to the number of no less than forty; and that to the self-same persons, to wit, 'the apostles whom he had chosen: To whom also,' says the text, 'he showed himself alive after his passion, by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God' (Acts 1:2,3).","Thus God therefore being willing more abundantly to show him unto the world, ordered this great season betwixt his resurrection and ascension, that the world might see that they had ground to believe an atonement was made for sin.",3.,"But again, a third thing that was to precede the execution of the second part of this his priestly office was, the manner and order of his going into the holiest; I say, the manner and order of his going.","He was to go thither in that robe of which mention was made before, to wit, in the virtue of his obedience, for it was that which was to make his way for him as now sprinkled with his blood.","He was to go thither with a noise which the Holy Ghost calls a shout, saying, 'God is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet' (Psa 47:5).","This was prefigured by the bells, as I said, which did hang on the border of Aaron's garments.","This shout seems to signify the voice of men and angels; and this trumpet the voice and joy of God; for so it says, he shall descend: 'For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God' (1 Thess 4:16).","Even as he ascended and went up; for Aaron's bells were to be heard when he went into, and when he came out of, the holy place (Exo 28:33-35).","But what men were to ascend with him, but, as was said afore, the men that 'came out of the graves after his resurrection?'",(Matt 27:53).,And what angels but those that ministered to him here in the day of his humiliation?,"As for the evil ones, he then rode in triumph over their heads, and crushed them as captives with his chariot wheels.","He is ascended on high, he has 'led captivity captive, he has received gifts for men' (Eph 4:8).","Thus then he ascended unto, into the holy paradise, where he was waited for of a multitude of the heavenly host, and of thousands of millions of the spirits of just men made perfect.","So approaching the highest heavens, the place of the special presence of God, he was bid sit down at his right hand, in token that, for his sufferings' sake, God had made him the highest of every creature, and given him a name above every name, and commanded that at the name of Jesus now all things in heaven should bow, and promised, that at the day of judgment, all on earth, and under it, should bow too, to the glory of God the Father (Phil 2:6-11).","Thus he presented himself on our behalf unto God, a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour, in which God resteth for ever, for that the blood of this sacrifice has always with him a pleasing and prevailing voice.","It cannot be denied, it cannot be outweighed by the heaviness, circumstances, or aggravations of any sin whatsoever, of them that come unto God by him.","He is always, as I said before, in the midst of the throne, and before the throne, 'a Lamb as it had been slain,' now appearing in the presence of God for us.","Of the manner of his intercession, whether it was vocal or virtual, whether by voice of mouth, or merit of deed, or both, I will not determine; we know but little while here, how things are done in heaven, and we may soon be too carnal, or fantastical in our apprehensions.","Intercession he makes, that is, he manages the efficacy and worth of his suffering with God for us, and is always prevalent in his thus managing of his merits on our behalf.","And as to the manner, though it be in itself infinitely beyond what we can conceive while here, yet God hath stooped to our weakness, and so expressed himself in this matter, that we might somewhat, though but childishly, apprehend him (1 Cor 13:11,12).","And we do not amiss if we conceive as the Word of God hath revealed; for the scriptures are the green poplar, hazel, and the chestnut rods that lie in the gutters where we should come to drink; all the difficulty is, in seeing the white strakes, the very mind of God there, that we may conceive by it.","But the text says he prayeth in heaven, he makes intercession there.","Again, it saith his blood speaks, and, consequently, why may not his groans, his tears, his sighs, and strong cries, which he uttered here in the days of flesh?","I believe they do, and have a strong voice with God for the salvation of his people.","He may then intercede both vocally and virtually; virtually to be sure he does, and we are allowed so to apprehend, because the text suggesteth such a manner of intercession to us; and because our weakness will not admit us to understand fully the thing as it is, our belief that he maketh intercession for us has also the advantage of being purged from its faultiness by his intercession, and we shall be saved thereby, because we have relied upon his blood shed, and the prevalency of the worthiness of it with God for us; though as to this circumstance, the manner of his interceding, we should be something at a loss.","The Word says that we have yet but the image of heavenly things, or of things in the heavens.","I do not at all doubt but that many of those that were saved before Christ came in the flesh, though they were, as to the main, right, and relied upon him to the saving of their souls, yet came far short of the knowledge of many of the circumstances of his suffering for them (Heb 10:1).",Did they all know that he was to be betrayed of Judas?,that he was to be scourged of the soldiers?,that he was to be crowned with thorns?,"that he was to be crucified between two thieves, and to be pierced till blood and water came out of his side?",or that he was to be buried in Joseph's sepulchre?,"I say, did all that were saved by faith that he was to come and die for them, understand these, with many more circumstances that were attendants of him to death?",It would be rude to think so; because for it we have neither scripture nor reason.,"Even so, we now that believe that 'he ever liveth to make intercession for us,' are also very short of understanding of the manner or mode of his so interceding.","Yet we believe that he died, and that his merits have a voice with God for us; yea, that he manages his own merits before God in way of intercession for us, far beyond what we, while here, are able to conceive.",The scripture saith that 'all the fulness of the Godhead' dwells in him 'bodily' (Col 2:9).,"It also saith that he is the throne of God, and yet again, that he sits 'on the right hand of the throne' (Isa 22:23; Heb 12:2).","These things are so far from being comprehended by the weakest, that they strain the wits and parts of the strongest, yet there is a heavenly truth in all.","Heavenly things are not easily believed, no not of believers themselves, while here on earth, and when they are, they are so but weakly and infirmly.","[27] I believe that the very appearing of Christ before God is an intercession as a priest, as well as a plea of an advocate; and I believe again, that his very life there is an intercession there, a continual intercession (Heb 9:24; Rom 5:10).","But there is yet something further to be said: Christ, the humanity of Christ, if in it dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, how then appears he before him to make intercession?","or if Christ is the throne of grace and mercy-seat, how doth he appear before God as sitting there, to sprinkle that now with his blood?","Again, if Christ be the altar of incense, how stands he as a priest by that altar to offer the prayers of all the saints thereon, before the throne?",[How these mysteries are to be learned.],"That all this is written is true; and that it is all truth, is as true: but that it is all understood by every one that is saved I do not believe is true.","I mean, so understood as that they could all reconcile the seeming contradictions that are in these texts.",There are therefore three lessons that God has set us as to the perfecting of our understanding in the mysteries of God.,1. Letters.,2.,Words.,3.,Meanings.,1. Letters.,"I call the ceremonial law so; for there all is set forth distinctly, everything by itself; as letters are to children: there you have a priest, a sacrifice, an altar, a holy place a mercy-seat: and all distinct.",2.,Words.,"Now in the gospel these letters are put all in a word, and Christ is that word, that word of God's mind; and therefore the gospel makes Christ that priest, Christ that sacrifice, Christ that altar, Christ that holy place, Christ that throne of grace, and all; for Christ is all: all these meet in him as several letters meet in one word.",3.,Meanings.,"Next to the word you have the meaning, and the meaning is more difficult to be learned than either the letters or the word; and therefore the perfect understanding of that is reserved till we arrive to a higher form, till we arrive to a perfect man; 'But when that which is perfect is come, then that' knowledge 'which is in part, shall be done away' (1 Cor 13:10).","Meantime our business is to learn to bring the letters into a word, to bring the ceremonies to Christ, and to make them terminate in him; I mean, to find the priesthood in Christ, the sacrifice in Christ, the altar in Christ, the throne of grace in Christ, and also God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself by him.","And if we can learn this well, while here, we shall not at all be blamed!","for this is the utmost lesson set us, to wit, to learn Christ as we find him revealed in the gospel: 'I determined,' saith Paul, 'not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified' (1 Cor 2:2).","And Christians, after some time, I mean those that pray and pry into the Word well, do attain to some good measure of knowledge of him.","It is life eternal to know him, as he is to be known here, as he is to be known by the Holy Scriptures (James 17:3).","Keep then close to the Scriptures, and let thy faith obey the authority of them, and thou wilt be sure to increase in faith; 'for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by faith' (Rom 1:17, 16:25-27).","[28] Believe then that Christ died, was buried, rose again, ascended, and ever liveth to make intercession for thee: and take heed of prying too far, for in mysteries men soon lose their way.","It is good therefore that thou rest in this, to wit, that he doth so, though thou canst not tell how he doth it.","A man at court gets by his intercession a pardon for a man in the country; and the party concerned, after he had intelligence of it, knows that such an one hath obtained his pardon, and that by his interceding, but for all that he may be ignorant of his methods of intercession, and so are we, at least in part, of Christ.","The meaning then is that I should believe, that for Christ's sake God will save me since he has justified me with his blood; 'being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him' (Rom 5:9).","Through his intercession, or through his coming between the God whom I have offended and me, a poor sinner: through his coming between with the voice of his blood and merits, which speaketh on my behalf to God, because that blood was shed for me, and because those merits, in the benefit of them, are made over to me by an act of the grace of God, according to his eternal covenant made with Christ.","This is what I know of his intercession; I mean with reference to the act itself; to wit, HOW he makes intercession.","And since all the fulness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily, and sine he also, as to his humanity, is the throne of grace; yea, and since he also is the holiest of all, and the rest of God for ever, it has been some scruple to me, whether it be not too carnal to imagine as if Christ stood distinct in his humanity; distinct, I say, as to space, from the Father as sitting upon a throne, and as so presenting his merits, and making vocal prayers for the life and salvation of his people.","The more true meaning in my apprehension is, that the presence and worth of the human nature, being with the divine, yea, taken into union with God for ever, for the service that was done by God for it, in the world, in reconciling his elect unto him, is still, and ever will be, so deserving in his sight as to prevail--I know not how else to express it--with the divine nature, in whom alone is a power to subdue all impossibilities to itself, to preserve those so reconciled to eternal life.","When I speak of the human nature, I mean the man Christ, not bereft of sense and reasons, nor of the power of willing and affecting;[29] but thus I mean, that the human nature so terminates in the will of the divine; and again, the will of the divine so terminates, as to saving of sinners, in the merit and will of the human, that what the Father would the Son wills, and what the Son wills the Father acquiesces in for ever.","And this the Son wills, and his will is backed with infinite merit, in which also the Father rests, that those, all those whom the Father hath given him, be with him where he is, that they may behold his glory (John 17:24).",And now I am come to the will and affections of the high-priest.,II.,NATURAL.,[The natural qualifications of Jesus Christ to be our high priest.],"This leads me to the second head, namely, to the natural qualifications of him.","And, First.","This is one thing that I would urge, he is not of a nature foreign to that of man; the angels love us well, but they are not so capable of sympathising with us in our distresses, because they are not partakers of our nature.","Nature hath a peculiar sympathy in it; now he is naturally one with us, sin only excepted, and that is our advantage too.","He is man as we are, flesh and blood as we are: born of a woman, and in all points made like unto us, that excepted which the Holy Ghost excepteth.","'Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same.","For verily he took not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham' (Heb 2:14,16).","This doth qualify him much; for, as I said before, there is a sympathy in nature.","A man will not be so affected with the hurt that comes to a beast, as he naturally will with the hurt that comes to a man: a beast will be more affected with those attempts that are made upon its own kind to hurt it, than it will be with those that are made upon man.",Wherefore?,"Why, there is a sympathy in nature.","Now that Christ, the high priest of the house of God, is naturally one with us, you see the Scriptures plainly affirm.","'God sent forth his Son, made of a woman' (Gal 4:4); he was 'made of the seed of David, according to the flesh' (Rom 1:3); from the fathers of whom, 'as concerning the flesh Christ came,' &c. (Rom 9:5; 2 Tim 2:8).","And this must needs then to make him a well-qualified high priest (Heb 2:14,15).","We will not now speak of the necessity of his taking upon him the human nature, to wit, that he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver his people; for that would be here too much beside our matter, and be a diversion to the reader.","We are now upon his High Priest's office, and of those natural qualifications that attend him, as to that; and I say, nature is a great qualification, because in nature there is sympathy; and where there is sympathy, there will be a provocation to help, a provocation to help with jealousy and indignation against those that afflict.","A bear robbed of her whelps is not more provoked than is the Lord Jesus when there are means used to make them miss of life eternal, for whom he hath died, and for whom he ever lives to make intercession.","But, Second.","As there is natural sympathy in Christ to those for whom he is an High Priest, so there is relative sympathy; he has not only taken to or upon him our nature, but he is become one brotherhood with us; now you know brotherhood will carry a man further than nature; so then, when nature and relation meet, there is a double obligation.","'For both he that sanctifieth,' which is Christ, 'and they who are sanctified,' his saints, 'are all of one,' which is God; and they are all of God, as children of a Father; 'for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee' (Heb 2:11,12).","Now a relation is much, and a natural relation most of all.","Why, here is a natural relation betwixt Christ the High Priest, and those for whom 'he ever liveth to make intercession'; a natural relation, I say, and that with respect to the humanity which is the nature subject to affliction and distress; 'Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same' (Heb 2:14).","So then it is for a brother that he is engaged, for a brother that he doth make intercession.","When Gideon knew by the confession of Zeba and Zalmunna, that the men that they slew at Tabor were his brethren, his fury came into his face, and he sware they should therefore die (Judg 8:18-21).",Relation is a great matter.,"And therefore it is said again, 'In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful High Priest' (Heb 2:17).",A brother is born for adversity; and a brother will go far.,"This therefore is a second thing or another qualification, with which Christ Jesus is furnished to be an High Priest; he is a brother, there is a brotherly relation betwixt him and us; therefore by virtue of this relation he maketh intercession for us more affectionately.",Third.,"There are other things in Christ Jesus that makes him naturally of an excellent qualification with reference to his priesthood for us, and they are the temptations and infirmities wherewith he was exercised in the days of his humiliation.","It is true, temptations and infirmities, strictly considered, are none of our nature, no more are they of his; but yet, if it be proper to say temptations and afflictions have a nature, his and ours were naturally the same; and that in all points too; for so says the text, 'He was tempted in all points, like as we are, yet without sin' (Heb 4:15).",Are we tempted to distrust God?,so was he: are we tempted to murder ourselves?,so was he: are we tempted with the bewitching vanities of this world?,"so was he: are we tempted to commit idolatry, and to worship the devil?",so was he (Matt 4:3-10; Luke 4:1-13).,"So that herein we also were alike; yea, from his cradle to his cross he was a man of sorrows and acquainted with griefs, a man of affliction throughout the whole course of his life.","And observe it, He was made so, or subjected thereto by the ordinance of God; nay, further, it behoved him to be made so, that is, to be made like unto us in all things, the better to capacitate him to the work of his priesthood, with the more bowels and compassion.","We will read to you the text; 'Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be,' qualified to be, 'a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.","For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted' (Heb 2:17,18).","See here how he is qualified, and to what end; he was tempted as we are, suffered by temptations as we do, in all points and things as we are; that he might be bowels, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest, in things pertaining to God, to make up the difference that is made by sin between God and his people, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.","Yea, he by being tempted, and by suffering as he did, he is prepared and enabled so to do; 'for in that he himself hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.'","Wherefore, I also call this qualification both natural and necessary; natural, because in kind the same with ours; that is, his temptations were the same with ours; the same in nature, the same in design, the same as to their own natural tendency; for their natural tendency was to have ruined both him and us, but God prevented.","They also were necessary, though not of themselves, yet made so by him that can bring good out of evil, and light out of darkness; made so, I say, to us, for whose sakes they were suffered to assault and afflict him, namely, that he might be able to be merciful, faithful, and succouring to us.",Fourth.,"Another qualification with which our High Priest is furnished, for the better fitting of him to make intercession for us, is, that we are his members; to be a member is more than to be of the same nature, or the nearest of relations, that excepted.","So, then, now he makes intercession for his own self, for his own body, and for the several members of his body.","The High Priest under the law did use to offer up sacrifice for himself; first 'for himself,' for his own sins, and then 'for the errors of the people.'","I will not say that Christ had any sin that was personally, or by his act, his own; for that would be to blaspheme the name of that Holy One; but yet I will say, he made the sins of the people his own (Psa 69:5).","Yea, God the Father made them his; those also for whom he ever liveth to make intercession, are united to him, made members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones; and so are any part of himself (2 Cor 5:21).","But we are now about his natural qualifications, and this is one; that they for whom he ever liveth to make intercession are his members, the members of his body; 'we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones,' so saith the Word (Eph 5:30).","Wherefore here is a near concern, for that his church is part of himself; it is his own concern, it is for our own flesh.","'No man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it' (Eph 5:29).--Things are thus spoken, because of the infirmity of our flesh.--So that had Christ no love to us as we are sinners, yet because we are part of himself, he cannot but care for us, nature puts him upon it; yea, and the more infirm and weak we are, the more he is touched with the feeling of our infirmities, the more he is afflicted for us: 'For we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities' (Heb 4:15).","He at no time loseth this his fellow-feeling, because he always is our head, and we the members of his.","I will add, the infirm member is most cared for, most pitied, most watched over to be kept from harms, and most consulted for.","[30] I love to play the child with little children, and have learned something by so doing; I have met with a child that has had a sore finger; yea, so sore as to be altogether at present useless; and not only so, but by reason of its infirmity, has been a let or hindrance to the use of all the fingers that have been upon that hand, then have I began to bemoan the child, and said, Alas!","my poor boy, or girl, hast got a sore finger!",Ah!,"quoth the child, with water in its eyes, and hath come to me to be bemoaned.",Then I have begun to offer to touch the sore finger.,O!,"saith the child, pray do not hurt me: I then have replied, Canst thou do nothing with this finger?","No, saith the child, nor with this hand either; then have I said, Shall we cut off this finger, and buy my child a better, a brave golden finger?","At this the child has started, stared in my face, gone back from me, and entertained a kind of indignation against me, and has no more cared to be intimate with me.",Then have I begun to make some use of that good sermon which this little child has preached unto me; and thus have I gone on.,"If membership be so dear, if this child has such tenderness to the most infirm, the most useless of its members; if it counts me its friend no longer than when I have a mouth to bemoan and carriages that show tenderness to this useless finger; what an interest doth membership give on in the body, and what compassions hath the soul for such an useless thing, because it is a member!","and turning all this over to Jesus Christ, then instead of matter and corruption, there presently comes honey to me out of this child's sore finger; I take leave to tell you now how I use to play.","And though I have told this tale upon so grave a truth, as is the membership of Christians with their head, yet bear with me; no child can be so tender of its sore finger as is the Son of God of his afflicted members; he cannot but be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.",[31] Ah!,"who would not make many supplications, prayers, and intercessions, for a leg, for an eye, for a foot, for a hand, for a finger, rather than they will lose it?","And can it be imagined that Christ alone shall be like the foolish ostrich, hardened against his young, yea, against his members?",It cannot be.,"Should he lose a member, he would be disfigured, maimed, dismembered, imperfect, next to monstrous.","For his body is called his fulness, yea, the fulness of him that fills all in all.","This has naturally a respect for those for whom he ever liveth to make intercession; yea, an unfathomable respect for them, because they are his members.",Fifth.,"But again, when nature, relation, and membership is urged to show the fit qualifications wherewith Christ is endued, I intend not to intimate, as if the bottom of all lay here; for then it might be urged that one imperfect has all these; for who knows not that sinful man has all these qualifications in him towards his nature, relations, and members?","I have therefore, as I said, thus discoursed, only for demonstration-sake, and to suit myself with the infirmity of your flesh.","I might come, also, in the next place, to tell you, that Jesus Christ our High Priest is thus, with reference to other designs.","We are his purchase and he counts us so; his jewels, and he counts us so; his estate real, and he counts us so (Psa 16:5,6).","And you know a man will do much, speak much, intercede much and long, for that which he thus is interested in.","But we will come to speak more particularly of the exceeding excellency of his natural qualifications, and show you that he hath such as are peculiar to himself alone, and that we are concerned in them.",[The peculiar natural qualifications of Christ as our High Priest.],1.,"He is holy, and so a suitable High Priest.","There is a holiness that sets further from, and a holiness that brings one nearer to, and to be concerned the more with the condition of those in affliction; and that holiness is that which is entailed unto office.","When a man is put into an office, the more unholy he is, the worse he performs his office; and the more holy, the better he performs his office.","For his holiness obliges him to be faithful unto men, wherein he is concerned by his office.","Hence you read, that he is 'a faithful High Priest,' because he is a holy one, and 'such an High Priest became us, who is holy,' &c. (Heb 2:17, 7:26).","'Good and upright is the Lord' Jehovah, Christ Jesus, 'therefore will he teach sinners in the way' (Psa 25:8).","'He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God' (2 Sam 23:3).","I mention these texts to show you, that holiness, when entailed to office, makes a man do that office the better.","Now then, Christ is holy, and he is made, called, and made of God an High Priest, after the order of Melchisedec, and is to manage that his office for thee with God; that is to say, to continue to make reconciliation for iniquity; for that iniquity that cleaveth unto thee, and that spuriously breaketh, or issueth from thy flesh after thou art called and converted.","For we are now upon the second part of the execution of the priesthood of Christ; that which he executeth, I say; and by executing takes away the iniquity of our holy things and of our life, after our turning to God by him.","Now he that is to do this is holy, and so one that will make conscience of performing that office for us, with which he is intrusted of God.","Hence he is set in opposition to those high priests that had infirmities, that were not holy, and upon this very account preferred above them.","'For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated,' perfected, or holy 'for evermore' (Heb 7:28).","This therefore is a great thing, to wit, that we have an High Priest that is holy, and so one that will not fail to perform to the utmost the trust committed to him in our behalf, to wit, 'to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins' (Heb 5:1).",This is one thing.,2.,There is added to this of his holiness another; and that is harmless.,"'For such an High Priest became us who is holy, harmless' (Heb 7:26).","A harmful man, when he is in office, O how much mischief may he do!","Such an one is partial in doing his office, such an one will put the poor by his right, such an one will buy and sell a cause, a man, an interest, will do or not do, as his harmfulness prompts him to it; 'so is a wicked ruler over the poor people' (Prov 28:15).","But now our Jesus, our High Priest, is holy, harmless; he will wrong no man, he will deprive no man, he will contemn no man, he will deny to no man that comes to God by him, the benefit and advantage of his blessed intercession; he respecteth not persons, nor taketh reward.","A harmful man will stomach, and hate, and prejudice a man; will wait for an opportunity to do him a mischief; will take the advantage, if he can, to deny him his right, and keep from him his due, when yet it is in the power of his hand to help him.",O!,"but Christ is harmless, harmless as a dove, he thinks no ill, intends no ill, doth no ill; but graciously, innocently, harmlessly, makes intercession for thee; nor will he be prevailed with to prejudice thy person, or to forbear to take up thy name into his lips, be thy infirmities, and weaknesses, and provocations never so many, if thou indeed comest to God by him.","He is holy, and harmless, and so the more fit to become our High Priest and to make intercession for us.",3.,"But again, this is not all, he also is undefiled; 'For such an High Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled.'","This term is put in to show, that he neither is, nor can be found, neither now, nor at any time, faulty in his office.",A man that is holy may yet be defiled; a man that is harmless may yet be defiled.,We are bid to be holy and harmless; and in a gospel sense so every Christian is.,O!,"but Christ is so in a legal sense; in the eye of the law, perfectly so.","This is a great matter, for it shows, that as nothing done by us can tempt him to be hurtful to us; so there is nothing in himself that can tempt him so to be.","A man that is defiled has that within him that will put him upon using of his office unfaithfully, though he should have no provocation from those for whose good he is to execute his office; but he that is undefiled--undefiled in a law sense--as our Lord Jesus is, is such an one as doth not only not do hurt, and not act falsely in his office, but one that cannot, one that knoweth not, how to be unfaithful to his trust.","He is holy, harmless, undefiled, this therefore is a great thing.","He has not the original of hurtfulness in him, there is no such root there; there is a root of bitterness, springing up in us, by which not only ourselves, but ofttimes others are defiled (Heb 12:15).",O!,"but our High Priest is undefiled, he is not corrupt, nor corrupteth; he doth his office fairly, faithfully, holily, justly, according to, or answering, our necessities, and the trust reposed in him, and committed to him.","But, 4.","This is not all; as he is holy, harmless, and undefiled; so he is separate from sinners, both in his conception, in his composition, and the place ordained for him to execute this part of his High Priest's office in.","He was not conceived in the womb by carnal generation; he was not made up of polluted and defiled nature; he officiateth not with those materials that are corrupt, stained, or imperfect; but with those that are unspotted, even with the spotless sacrifice of his own unblemished offering.","He, nor his offering, has any such tang, as had the priests, and their sacrifices under the law, to wit, sin and imperfection; he is separate from them in this respect, further than is an angel from a beast.","He has none of the qualities, actions, or inclinations of sinners; his ways are only his own; he never saw them, nor learned them, but of the Father; the none upright among men, wherefore he is separated from them to be a priest.","Again, 5.","As he is thus, so again, he is said to be 'higher than the heavens.'","For such an High Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, and undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens.","The text saith, that neither saint, nor heavens, are clean in God's sight.","'Behold he puts no trust in his servants,' he chargeth his angels with folly; and again, 'Behold he putteth no trust in his saints, yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight' (Job 4:18, 15:15).","Wherefore, by this expression, he shows us that our High Priest is more noble than either heaven or angel: yea, more clean and perfect than any.","It shows us also that all the heavenly host are at his command, to do as his intercession shall prevail with the Father for us.","All angels worship him, and at his word they become, they all become ministering spirits for them who shall be heirs of salvation.","Besides, by this word he shows, that it is impossible that our High Priest should degenerate or decay; for that he is made 'higher than the heavens'; the spirits sometimes in the heavens have decayed (2 Peter 2:4).",The heavens themselves decay and wax old; and that is the farthest that by the Word we are admitted to go (Heb 1:10-12).,"But as for him that is above the heavens, that is made higher than the heavens, that is ascended up far above all heavens; he is the same, and 'his years fail not' (Heb 1:12).","'The same yesterday, today, and for ever' (Heb 13:8).","This therefore is added, to show that Christ is neither as the angels, nor heavens, subject to decay, or degenerate, or to flag and grow cold in the execution of his office; but that he will be found even at the last, when he is come to the end of this work, and is about to come out of the holy place, as affectionate, as full of love, as willing, and desirous after our salvation, as he was the first moment that he was made High Priest, and took upon him to execute that his blessed office for us.",Wherefore our High Priest is no such one as you read of in the law (Lev 21:18).,"He is no dwarf, hath no blemish, nor any imperfection; therefore is not subject to flag or fail in due execution of his office, but is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him, 'seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.'","And it is well worth our consideration, that it is said he is made thus; that is, appointed, instituted, called, and qualified thus of God; this shows the Father's heart as well as the Son's, to usward, to wit, that this priesthood was of him, and the glorious effects thereof by him.","'Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'","[The second motive, we are sure to speed.]",SECOND.,"I come now to the second motive, to wit, that we may find grace and mercy to help in time of need; or we shall find grace and mercy to help, if we come as we should, to the throne of grace.",In this motive we have these three things considerable.,"First, That saints are like to meet with needy times while they are in this world.","Second, That nothing can carry us through our needy times but more, or a continual supply of mercy and grace.","Third, That mercy and grace is to be had at the throne of grace, and we must fetch it from thence by prayer, if we would, as we should, go through these needy times.",First.,"For the first of these, that saints are like to meet with needy times, or with such times as will show them that they need a continual assistance of the grace of God, that they may go rightly through this world.","This is therefore a motive, that weareth a spur in the heel of it, a spur to prick us forward to supplicate at the throne of grace.","This needy time is in other places called the perilous time, the evil day, the hour and power of darkness, the day of temptation, the cloudy and dark day (2 Tim 3:1; Eph 6:13; Luke 22:53; Heb 3:8; Eze 34:12; Gen 47:9; Matt 6:34).","And indeed, in the general, all the days of our pilgrimage here are evil, yea, every day has a sufficiency of evil in it to destroy the best saint that breatheth, were it not for the grace of God.","But there are also, as I have hinted, particular special times, times more eminently dangerous and hazardous unto saints.","As, [Ten special times of need.]","There are their young days, the days of their youth, and childhood in grace.",This day is usually attended with much evil towards him or them that are asking the way to Zion with their faces thitherward.,"Now the devil has lost a sinner; there is a captive has broke prison, and one run away from his master: now hell seems to be awakened from sleep, the devils are come out, they roar, and roaring they seek to recover their runaway.","Now tempt him, threaten him, flatter him, stigmatise him, throw dust into his eyes, poison him with error, spoil him while he is upon the potter's wheel; any thing to keep him from coming to Jesus Christ.",And is not this a needy time; doth not such an one want abundance of grace?,"is it not of absolute necessity that thou, if thou art the man thus beset, shouldst ply it at the throne of grace, for mercy and grace to help thee in such a time of need as this?","To want a spirit of prayer now, is as much as thy life is worth.","O, therefore, you that know what I say, you that are broke loose from hell, that are fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before you, and that do hear the lion roar after you, and that are kept awake with the continual voice of his chinking chain, cry as you fly; yea, the promise is, that they that come to God with weeping, with supplication, he will lead them.","Well, this is one needy time, now thy hedge is low, now thy branch is tender, now thou art but in the bud.",Pray that thou beest not marred in the potter's hand.,2.,"The time of prosperity is also a time of need, I mean of thy spiritual prosperity.","For as Satan can tell how to suit temptations for thee in the day of thy want, so he has those that can entangle thee in the day of thy fulness.",He has his spiritual wickednesses in the high and heavenly places (Eph 6:12).,"He can tell how to lay a snare for thee in the land of Canaan, as well as in the wilderness; in thy time of receiving good things, as well as in thy hungry and empty hours.","Nay, such times seem to be the most dangerous, not in themselves, but through the deceits of our heart.","Hence Moses gives this caution to the children of Israel, that when God had given them the promised land, and vineyards, and wells, and olive trees, and when they had eaten and were full, 'Then,' says he, 'beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage' (Deut 6:10-13).","And again, he doubleth this caution, saying, 'When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord thy God, for the good land which he hath given thee.","Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day; lest when thou hast eaten and art full,' and thou in all good things art increased, 'then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage'; all this may be applied spiritually (Deut 8:10-14).","For there are, as I said, snares laid for us in our best things; and he that has great enjoyments, and forgets to pray for grace to keep him humble then, shall quickly be where Peter was, after his knowledge of the Lord Jesus by the revelation of the Father.",3.,"Another needy time is a time when men are low and empty, as to worldly good; this time is full of temptations and snares.","At this time, men will, if they look not well to their doings and goings, be tempted to strain curtesies both with conscience and with God's Word, and adventure to do things that are dangerous, and that have a tendency to make all their religion and profession vain.","This holy Agur was aware of; so he prayed, Let me not be rich and full, lest I deny thee; let me not be poor, lest I steal, and take the name of my God in vain (Prov 30:7-9).",There are many inconveniences that attend him that is fallen into decay in this world.,"It is an evil day with him, and the devils will be as busy with him, as the flies are with a lean and scabbed sheep.","It shall go hard but such a man shall be full of maggots; full of silly, foolish, idle inventions, to get up, and to abound with fulness again.","It is not a time now, will Satan say, to retain a tender conscience, to regard thy word or promise, to pay for what thou buyest, or to stick at pilfering, and filch from thy neighbour.",[32] This Agur was afraid of; therefore he prayed that God would keep him from that which would be to him a temptation to do it.,"How many in our day have, on these very accounts, brought religion to a very ill savour, and themselves unto the snare of the devil, and all because they have not addicted themselves to pray to God for grace to help in this time of need, but rather have left off the thing that is good, and given up themselves to the temptations of the devil, and the subtle and ensnaring motions of the flesh.",4.,"Another needy time is the day of persecution; this is called, as was hinted before, 'the hour of darkness,' 'the cloudy and dark day.'","This day, therefore, is full of snares, and of evils of every kind.","Here is the fear of man, the terrors of a prison, of loss of goods and life.","[33] Now all things look black, now the fiery trial is come.","He that cannot now pray; he that now applieth not himself to God on the throne of grace, by the priesthood of Jesus Christ, is like to take a fall before all men upon the stage; a foul fall, a fall that will not only break his own bones, but also the hearts of those that fear God and behold it: 'Come therefore boldly unto the throne of grace, that ye may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'",5.,"Another time of need is that time wherein thou changest thy condition, and enterest into a new relation.",For here also the snares and traps lie waiting for thee.,"There is a hopeful child goes to service, or to be an apprentice; there is a young man, a young maid, entereth into a married condition, and though they pray before, yet they leave off to pray then.","Why, these people are oftentimes ruined and undone; the reason is, this change is attended with new snares, with new cares, and with new temptations, of the which, because through unwatchfulness they are not aware, they are taken, drawn to perdition and destruction by them.","Many in my short day have gone, I doubt, down to the pit, THIS way, that have sometimes been to appearance the very foremost and hopefulest in the place where they have lived.",O how soon has their fire gone out; has their lamps forborne to burn!,"How quickly have they lost their love to their ministers, by whom they were illuminated, and to the warmest Christians, through communion with whom they used to be kept awake and savoury!","How quickly have they found them out new friends, new companions, new ways and methods of life, and new delights to feed their foolish minds withal!","Wherefore, O thou that art in this fifth head concerned, 'Come boldly unto the throne of grace, to obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'",6.,"Another time of need is, when the generality of professors are decayed; when the custom of fancies and fooleries have taken away all gravity and modesty from among the children of men.","Now pray, or thou diest; yea, pray against those decays, those vain customs, those foolish fancies, those light and vain carriages that have overtaken others, else they will assuredly knock at thy door, and obtain favour at thy hand, the which if they do, they will quickly bring thee down into the dirt with others, and put thee in peril of damnation as well as they.",7.,"Another time of need is, the time of guilt contracted, and of the hiding of God's face.",This is a dangerous time.,"If thou now shalt forbear to pray, thou art undone, for the natural tendency of guilt is to drive a man from God.","So it served our first father; and ofttimes when God hides his face, men run into desperation, and so throw up all duties, and say as he of old, 'What should I wait for the Lord any longer?'",(2 Kings 6:33).,"Now thy great help against this is prayer, continuing in prayer.","Prayer wrestleth with the devil, and will overthrow him: prayer wrestleth with God, and will overcome him: prayer wrestleth with all temptations, and makes them fly.","Great things have been done by prayer, even by the prayer of those that have contracted guilt, and that have by their sins lost the smiles and sense of the favour of God.","Wherefore, when this needy, this evil time has overtaken thee, pray: 'Come boldly unto the throne of grace, to obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'",8.,"The day of reproach and slander is another time of need, or a day in which thou wilt want supplies of grace.","Sometimes we meet with such days wherein we are loaden with reproaches, slanders, scandals, and lies.","Christ found the day of reproach a burdensome day unto him; and there is many a professor driven quite away from all conscience towards God, and open profession of his name, by such things as these (Psa 69:7).","Reproach is, when cast at a man, as if he was stoning to death with stones.","Now ply it hard at the throne of grace, for mercy and grace to bear thee up, or thou wilt either miscarry or sink under ground by the weight of reproach that may fall upon thee.",[34] 9.,"Another time of need is that wherein a man's friends desert and forsake him, because of his gospel principles, or of those temptations that attend his profession.",This is a time that often happeneth to those that are good.,"Thus it was with Christ, with Paul, with Job, with Heman, and so has been with many other of God's servants in the day of their temptations in this world; and a sore time it is.","Job complained under it, so did Heman, Paul, and Christ (John 6:66; 2 Tim 1:15; Job 19:13-19).","Now a man is as forlorn as a pelican in the wilderness, as an owl in the desert, or as a sparrow upon the house-top.","If a man cannot now go to the throne of grace by prayer, through Christ, and so fetch grace for his support from thence, what can he do?",He cannot live of himself (John 15:4).,Wherefore this is a sore evil.,10.,"Another time of need is the day of death, when I am to pack up and to be gone from hence, the way of all the earth.","[35] Now the greatest trial is come, excepting that of the day of judgment.","Now a man is to be stripped of all, but that which cannot be shaken.",Now a man grows near the borders of eternity.,Now he begins to see into the skirts of the next world.,"Now death is death, and the grave the grave indeed!","Now he begins to see what it is for body and soul to part, and what to go and appear before God (Eccl 12:5).","Now the dark entry, and the thoughts of what is in the way from a deathbed to the gate of the holy heaven, comes nearer the heart than when health and prosperity do compass a man about.","Wherefore this is like to be a trying time, a time of need indeed.","A prudent man will make it one of the great concerns of his whole life to get, and lay up a stock of grace for this day, though the fool will rage and be confident: for he knows all will be little enough to keep him warm in his soul, while cold death strokes his hand over his face, and over his heart, and is turning his blood into jelly; while strong death is loosing his silver cord, and breaking his golden bowl!",(Eccl 12:6).,"Wherefore, I say, this motive weareth a spur on his heel, a spur to prick us on to the throne of grace for mercy, and grace to help in time of need.","But, [Continual supplies of grace essential to our welfare.]",Second.,"I come now to the next thing, which is, to show that nothing can carry us through our needy times, but more or a continual supply of mercy and grace.","This the text fully implies, because it directeth us to the throne of grace, for mercy and grace for that very end.","And had there been any thing else that could have done it, the apostle would have made mention of it, and would also have directed the saints unto it.","But forasmuch as he here makes mention of the needy time, and directs them to the throne of grace for mercy and grace to help, it followeth that mercy and grace, and that only, can help us in the evil time.",Now mercy and grace are to be distinctly considered.,1.,"Mercy, for that by it we have through Christ the continuation and multiplication of forgivenesses, without which there is no salvation.",2.,"Grace, for that by it we are upheld, supported, and enabled to go through our needy times, as Christians, without which there is no salvation neither.","The first all will grant, the second is clear: 'If any man draws back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him; but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul' (Heb 10:38,39).",1.,"Mercy is that by which we are pardoned, even all the falls, faults, failings, and weaknesses, that attend us, and that we are incident to, in this our day of temptation; and for this mercy we should pray, and say, 'Our Father, forgive us our trespasses' (Matt 6:9-12).","For though mercy is free in the exercise of it to usward, yet God will have us ask, that we may have; as he also saith in the text, 'Let us come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy.'","Here then we have one help, and that is, the mercy of God is to be extended to us from his throne through Jesus Christ, for our pardon and forgiveness in all those weaknesses that we are attended with in the needy or evil times; and we should come to God for this very thing.","This is that which David means, when he says, 'Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever' (Psa 23:6).","And again, 'When I said my foot slippeth; thy mercy, O Lord, held me up' (Psa 94:18).","Set me clear and free from guilt, and from the imputation of sin unto death, by Christ.","Nor can any thing help where this is wanting; for our parts, our knowledge, our attainments, nor our graces, cannot so carry us through this world, but that we shall be guilty of that that will sink us down to hell, without God's pardoning mercy.","It is not the grace that we have received can do it, nor the grace that is to be received that can do it; nothing can do it but the pardoning mercy of God: for because all our graces are here imperfect, they cannot produce a spotless obedience.","But where there is not a spotless obedience, there must of necessity follow a continuation of pardon and forgiveness by mercy, or I know what will become of the soul.","Here, therefore, the apostle lays an obligation upon thee to the throne of grace, to wit, that thou mayest obtain mercy, a continuation of mercy, mercy as long as thou art like to live this vain life on the earth; mercy that will reach through all thy days.","For there is not a day, nor a duty; not a day that thou livest, nor a duty that thou dost, but will need that mercy should come after to take away thy iniquity.","[36] Nay, thou canst not receive mercy so clearly, as not to stand in need of another act of mercy to pardon weakness in thy no better receiving the last.","We receive not our mercies so humbly, so readily, so gladly, and with that thankfulness as we should: and therefore, for the want of these, have the need of another, and another act of God's sin-pardoning mercy, and need shall have thereof, as long as evil time shall last with us.","But is not this great grace, that we should thus be called upon to come to God for mercy?","Yea, is not God unspeakably good, in providing such a throne of grace, such a sacrifice, such a high priest, and so much mercy for us, and then to invite us to come with boldness to him for it?","Nay, doth not his kindness yet further appear, by giving of us items and intimations of needy times, and evil days, on purpose to provoke us to come to him for mercy?","This then shows us, as also we have hinted before, that the throne of grace, and Christ Jesus our High Priest, are both provided upon the account of our imperfections, namely, that we who are called might not be, by remaining weaknesses, hindered of, but obtain eternal inheritance.","Weaknesses, such weaknesses remain in the justified, and such slips and failings are found in and upon them, that call for a course of mercy and forgiveness to attend them.","Farther, this also intimates, that God's people should not be dejected at the apprehensions of their imperfections; I say, not so dejected, as therefore to cast off faith, and hope, and prayer; for a throne of grace is provided for them, to the which they may, they must, they ought continually to resort for mercy, sin-pardoning mercy.",2.,"As we are here to obtain mercy, so we are here to find grace.","They that obtain mercy, shall find grace, therefore they are put together.","That they may obtain mercy and find grace; only they must find mercy first; for as forgiveness at first goes before sanctification in the general, so forgiveness afterwards goes before particular acts of grace for further sanctification.","God giveth not the spirit of grace to those that he has not first forgiven by mercy, for the sake of Christ.","[37] Also so long as he as a Father forbears to forgive us as his adopted, so long we go without those further additions of grace that are here suggested in the text.","But when we have obtained mercy to forgive, then we also find grace to our renewing.","Therefore he saith, First obtain mercy, and then find grace.","Grace here I take to be that grace which God has appointed for us, to dwell in us; and that by and through the continual supply of which we are to be enabled to do and suffer, and to manage ourselves in doing and suffering according to the will of God.",'Let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear' (Heb 12:28).,"So again, 'he giveth more grace; wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble' (James 4:6; Prov 3:34; 1 Peter 5:5).","The grace, therefore, that this text intends, is grace given or to be given; grace received or to be received; grace a root, a principle of grace, with its continual supplies for the perfecting of that salvation that God has designed for us.","This was that which comforted Paul, when the messenger of Satan was sent to buffet him, it was said unto him by Christ, 'My grace is sufficient for thee' (2 Cor 12:9).","As who should say, Paul, be not utterly cast down, I have wherewith all to make thee stand, and overcome, and that is my grace, by which thou shalt be supported, strengthened, comforted, and made to live a triumphant life, notwithstanding all that oppress thee.","But this came to him upon his praying; for this I prayed to God thrice, saith he.","So again, 'God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye always have all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work' (2 Cor 9:8).","Thus you see, that by grace in these places is meant that spirit, and those principles of grace, by the increase and continual supply of which we are inwardly strengthened, and made to abound to every good work.","This then is the conclusion, That as there is mercy to be obtained by us at the throne of grace, for the pardon of all our weaknesses; so there is also grace there to be found that will yet strengthen us more, to all good walking and living before him.","He giveth more grace, and they receive one time or another abundance of grace that shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ.","This then teaches us several things, some of which I will mention.","As, [What this should teach us.]",1.,"That nature, as nature, is not capable of serving of God: no, not nature where grace dwells, as considered abstract from that grace that dwells in it.","Nothing can be done aright without grace, I mean no part nor piece of gospel-duty.",'Let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably.',"Nature, managed by grace, seasoned with grace, and held up with grace, can serve God acceptably.","Let us have grace, seek for and find grace to do so; for we cannot do so but by grace: 'By the grace of God I am what I am; and his grace which was bestowed upon me, was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me' (1 Cor 15:10).",What can be more plain than this beautiful text?,"For the apostle doth here quite shut out nature, sanctified nature, for he indeed was a sanctified man, and concludes that even he, as of himself, did nothing of all the great works that he did; but they were done, he did them by the grace of God that was in him.","Wherefore nature, sanctified nature, as nature, can of itself do nothing to the pleasing of God the Father.",Is not this the experience of all the godly?,Can they do that at all times which they can do at some times?,"Can they pray, believe, love, fear, repent, and bow before God always alike?",No.,Why so?,"they are the same men, the same human nature, the same saints.","Aye, but the same grace, in the same degree, operation, and life of grace, doth not so now work on that man, that nature, that saint; therefore, notwithstanding he is what he is, he cannot do at all times alike.","Thus therefore it is manifest, that nature, simply as such, is a great way off of doing that which is acceptable with God.","Refined, purified, sanctified nature, cannot do but by the immediate supplies, lifts, and helps of that spirit and principle of grace by the which it is so sanctified.",2.,"As nature, even where grace is, cannot, without the assistance of that grace, do anything acceptably before God; so grace received, if it be not also supplied with more grace, cannot cause that we continue to do acceptable service to God.","This also is clear by the text, For he speaketh there to them that had received grace; yea, puts himself into the number, saying, 'Let us come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may find grace to help in time of need.'","If grace received would do, what need for more?",What need we pray for more?,What need we go to the throne of grace for more?,"This very exhortation saith it will not: present supplies of grace are proportioned to our present need, and to help us to do a present work or duty.","[38] But is our present need all the need that we are like to have, and the present work all the work that we have to do in the world?","Even so the grace that we have received at present, though it can help us to do a present work, it cannot, without a further supply, help us to do what is to be done hereafter.","Wherefore, the apostle saith, that his continuing to do was through his obtaining help, continual help of God: 'Having, therefore,' saith he, 'obtained help of God, I continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great,' &c. (Acts 26:22).","There must be a daily imploring of God for daily supplies from him, if we will do our daily business as we should.","A present dispensation of grace is like a good meal, a seasonable shower, or a penny in one's pocket, all which will serve for the present necessity.","But will that good meal that I ate last week, enable me, without supply, to do a good day's work in this?","or will that seasonable shower which fell last year, be, without supplies, a seasonable help to the grain and grass that is growing now?","or will that penny that supplied my want the other day, I say, will the same penny also, without a supply, supply my wants today?","The same may, I say, be said of grace received; it is like the oil in the lamp, it must be fed, it must be added to.","And there, there shall be a supply, 'wherefore he giveth more grace.'","Grace is the sap, which from the root maintaineth the branches: stop the sap, and the branch will wither.","Not that the sap shall be stopped where there is union, not stopped for altogether; for as from the root the branch is supplied, so from Christ is every member furnished with a continual supply of grace, if it doth as it should; 'of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace' (John 1:16).",The day of grace is the day of expense: this is our spending time.,"Hence we are called pilgrims and strangers in the earth, that is, travellers from place to place, from state to state, from trial to trial (Heb 11:13).","Now, as the traveller at a fresh inn is made to spend fresh money; so Christians, at a fresh temptation, at a new temptation, are made to spend afresh, and a new supply of grace.","Great men, when and while their sons are travellers, appoint that their bags of money be lodged ready, or conveniently paid in at such and such a place, for the suitable relief of them; and so they meet with supplies.","Why, so are the sons of the Great One, and he has allotted that we should travel beyond sea, or at a great distance from our Father's house: wherefore he has appointed that grace shall be provided for us, to supply at such a place, such a state or temptation, as need requires: but withal, as my lord expecteth his son should acquaint him with the present emptiness of his purse, and with the difficulty he hath now to grapple with; so God our Father expects that we should plead by Christ our need at the throne of grace, in order to a supply of grace:[39] 'Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'","Now then, this shows the reason why many Christians that are indeed possessed with the grace of God, do yet walk so oddly, act so poorly, and live such ordinary lives in the world.","They are like to those gentlemen's sons that are of the more extravagant sort, that walk in their lousy hue, when they might be maintained better.","Such young men care not, perhaps scorn to acquaint their fathers with their wants, and therefore walk in their threadbare jackets, with hose and shoes out at heels!",a right emblem of the uncircumspect child of God.,"This also shows the reason of all those dreadful falls and miscarriages that many of the saints sustain, they made it not their business to watch to see what is coming, and to pray for a supply of grace to uphold them; they, with David, are too careless, or, with Peter, too confident, or, with the disciples, too sleepy, and so the temptation comes upon them; and their want like an armed man.","This also shows the reason why some that, to one's thinking, would fall every day; for that their want of parts, their small experience, their little knowledge of God's matters, do seem to bespeak it; yet stand, walk better, and keep their garments more white than those that have, when compared with them, twice as much as they.","They are praying saints, they are often at the throne of grace, they are sensible of their weakness, keep a sight of their danger before their faces, and will not be contented without more grace.",Third.,"And this leads me, in the third place, to show you, that were we wise, and did we ply it at the throne of grace for grace, as we should, O what spotless lives might we live!","We should then have always help in time of need; for so the text insinuates, 'That we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'","This is that which Peter means, when he says, 'And besides this,' that is, besides your faith in Christ, and besides your happy state of justification, 'giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity.","For if these things be in you and abound,' and be continually supplied with a supply from the throne of grace, 'they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.","But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.","Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ' (2 Peter 1:5-11).","The greatest part of professors now-a-days take up their time in contracting of guilt, and asking for pardon, and yet are not much the better.","Whereas, if they had but the grace to add to their faith, virtue, &c., they might have more peace, live better lives, and not have their heads so often in a bag as they have.","'To him that ordereth his conversation aright, will I show the salvation of God' (Psa 50:23).",To him that disposeth his way aright; now this cannot be done without a constant supplicating at the throne of grace for more grace.,"This then is the reason why every new temptation that comes upon thee, so foils, so overcomes thee, that thou wilt need a new conversion to be recovered from under the power and guilt that cleaves to thee by its overshadowing of thee.","A new temptation, a sudden temptation, an unexpected temptation, usually foils those that are not upon their watch; and that have not been before with God to be inlaid with grace proportionable to what may come upon them.",'That ye may find grace to help in time of need'!,There is grace to be found at the throne of grace that will help us under the greatest straits.,"'Seek and ye shall find'; it is there, and it is to be found there; it is to be found there of the seeking soul, of the soul that seeketh him.","Wherefore I will conclude as I did begin; 'Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.'",[CONCLUSION.,Some lessons to be learned from this text.],"We will now speak something by way of conclusion, and so wind up the whole.",First.,"You must remember that we have been hitherto speaking of the throne of grace, and showing what it is.","That we have also been speaking of Christ's sacrifice, and how he manages his high priest's office before the throne of grace.","We have also here, as you see, been speaking of the mercy and grace that is to be obtained and found at this throne of grace, and of what advantage it is to us in this our pilgrimage.","Now, from all this it follows, that sin is a fearful thing: for all this ado is, that men might be saved from sin!",What a devil then is sin?,it is the worst of devils; it is worse than all devils; those that are devils sin hath made them so; nor could anything else have made them devils but sin.,"Now, I pray, what is it to be a devil, but to be under, for ever, the power and dominion of sin, an implacable spirit against God?","Such an one, from which implacableness all the power in heaven and earth cannot release them, because God of his justice has bound them over to judgment.","These spirits are by sin carried quite away from themselves, as well as from God that made them; they cannot design their own good; they cannot leave that which yet they know will be everlasting mischievous to themselves.","Sin has bound them to itself so fast, that there can be no deliverance for them, but by the Son of God, who also has refused them, and left them to themselves, and to the judgment which they have deserved.","Sin also has got a victory over man, has made him an enemy to God and to his own salvation; has caught him, captivated him, carried away his mind, and will, and heart, from God; and made him choose to be vain, and to run the hazard of eternal damnation, with rejoicing and delight.","But God left not man where he left those wicked spirits, to wit, under the everlasting chains of darkness, reserved unto judgment; but devised means for their ransom and reconciliation to himself; which is the thing that has been discoursed of in the foregoing part of this book (2 Sam 15:15).","But, I say, what a thing is sin, what a devil and master of devils is it, that it should, where it takes hold, so hang that nothing can unclinch its hold but the mercy of God and the heart-blood of his dear Son!","O the fretting, eating, infecting, defiling, and poisonous nature of sin, that it should so eat into our flesh and spirit, body and soul, and so stain us with its vile and stinking nature: yea, it has almost turned man into the nature of itself; insomuch as that sometimes, when nature is mentioned, sin is meant; and when sin is mentioned, nature is meant (Eph 2:3, 5:8).","Wherefore sin is a fearful thing; a thing to be lamented, a thing to be abhorred, a thing to be fled from with more astonishment and trembling than one would fly from any devil, because it is the worst of things; and that without which nothing can be bad, and because where it takes hold it so fasteneth that nothing, as I have said, can release whom it has made a captive, but the mercy of God and the heart-blood of his dear Son.",O what a thing is sin!,Second.,"As by what hath been said sin appears to be exceeding sinful; so, from hence it also follows, that the soul is a precious thing.",For you must know all this is for the redemption of the soul.,"The redemption of the soul is precious (Psa 49:8,20).","I say, it is for the redemption of the soul; it was for this that Christ was made a priest, a sacrifice, an altar, a throne of grace; yea, sin, a curse, and what not, that was necessary for our deliverance from sin, and death, and everlasting damnation.","He that would know what a soul is, let him read in letters of blood the price and purchase of the soul.","It was not for a light, a little, an inconsiderable thing, that Christ Jesus underwent what he suffered when he was in the world, and gave himself a ransom for souls.","No, no!","The soul is a great, a vast great thing, notwithstanding it is so little set by of some.","Some prefer anything that they fancy, above the soul; a slut, a lie, a pot, an act of fraudulency, the swing of a prevailing passion, anything shall be preferred when the occasion offereth itself.","[40] If Christ had set as little by souls as some men do, he had never left his Father's bosom, and the glory that he had with him; he had never so humbled himself, so gave himself to punishment, affliction, and sorrow; and made himself so the object of scorn, and contempt, and reproach, as he did, and all that the souls of sinners might live a life in glory with him.","But methinks this is the mystery of all as to this, that the soul should take that pains, contrive such ways, and take such advantages against itself!","For it is the soul that sins, that the soul might die!",O!,"sin, what art thou?",What hast thou done?,"and what still wilt thou further do, if mercy, and blood and grace doth not prevent thee?",O silly soul!,what a fool has sin made of thee?,what an ass art thou become to sin?,"that ever an immortal soul, at first made in the image of God, for God, and for his delight, should so degenerate from its first station, and so abase itself that it might serve sin, as to become the devil's ape, and to play like a Jack Pudding for him upon any stage or theatre in the world!","But I recall myself; for if sin can make one who was sometimes a glorious angel in heaven, now so to abuse himself as to become, to appearance, as a filthy frog, a toad, a rat, a cat, a fly, a mouse, a dog, or bitch's whelp,[41] to serve its ends upon a poor mortal, that it might gull them of everlasting life, no marvel if the soul is so beguiled as to sell itself from God, and all good, for so poor a nothing as a momentary pleasure is.","But, Third.","If sin and the soul are such great things, then behold the love and care of God; the love to souls, the care he hath taken to deliver them from sin.","Sin, as I have said, is such a thing as from which no man can deliver himself; the soul is such a thing, so rich and valuable in the nature of it, that scarce one in twenty thousand counts of it as they should.","But God, the lover of mankind, and the greatest enemy to sin, has provided means effectually to overthrow the one, and to save and secure the other.","Behold, therefore, the love of God, the care of God for us; for when we neither loved nor cared for ourselves, God both loved us and cared for us.",God commended his love towards us in sending his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.,"Let it be then concluded that 'GOD IS LOVE,' and that the love that God hath to us is such as we never had for ourselves.","We have been often tried about our own love to ourselves, and it has been proved over, and over, and over, that sometimes even we that are Christians could, and would, had it been possible, have pawned ourselves, our souls, and our interest in Christ, for a foul and beastly lust.","But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, would not suffer it so to be.","Now, if we are so fickle and uncertain in our love to ourselves, as to value our salvation at so low and so base a rate, can it be imagined that ever we should, had it been left to our choice, have given the best of what we have for the salvation of our souls?",Yet God gave his Son to be the Saviour of the world.,"I say again, if our love is so slender to our own souls, can any think that it should be more full to the souls of others?","And yet God had such love to us, as to give his only begotten Son for our sins.","Yet again, how should it be that we, who are usually so affected with the conceit of our own happiness, since we care no more for our own souls, do our best to secure the souls of others?","and yet God, who is infinitely above all creatures, has so condescended, as to concern himself, and to give the best of his flock, even his only beloved Son, for very dust and ashes.","Wherefore, 'Herein is love, not that we loved God,' or our neighbour, 'but that God loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins' (1 John 4:10).",Fourth.,Is sin so vile a thing?,is the soul so precious a thing?,and is God's love and care of the salvation of the souls of sinners infinitely greater than is their own care for their own souls?,"Then this should teach those concerned to blush, to blush, I say, and to cover their faces with shame.","There is nothing, as I know of, that more becomes a sinner, than blushing and shame doth; for he is the harbourer, the nurse, and the nourisher of that vile thing called sin; that so great an enemy of God, and that so great an enemy to the soul.","It becomes him also, if he considers what a creature God has made him, and how little he hath set by his own creation, and by the matter of which God hath made his soul.","Let him also consider unto what base things he hath stooped and prostrated himself, while things infinitely better have stood by and offered themselves unto him freely; yea, how he has cast that God that made him, and his Son that came to redeem him, quite behind his back, and before their faces embraced, loved, and devoted himself unto him that seeks nothing more than the damnation of his soul.","Ah, Lord!","when will foolish man be wise, and come to God with his hands upon his head, and with his face covered with shame, to ask him forgiveness for that wickedness which he has committed?","which is wickedness committed not only against holiness and justice, against which also men by nature have an antipathy, but against mercy and love, without which man cannot tell what to do.","Blush, sinner, blush.","Ah, that thou hadst grace to blush!","But this is God's complaint, 'Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?","Nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush' (Jer 8:12).","It is a sad thing that men should be thus void of consideration, and yet they are so.","They are at a continual jest with God and his Word, with the devil and sin, with hell and judgment.",But they will be in earnest one day; but that one day will be too late!,Fifth.,"Is it so that God, though sin is so fearful a thing, has prepared an effectual remedy against it, and purposed to save us from the evil and damning effects thereof?",(1.),"Then this should beget thankfulness in the hearts of the godly, for they are made partakers of this grace; I say, it should beget thankfulness in thy heart.","'Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift,' said the apostle, when he seriously thought of that which was much inferior to what we have been a discoursing of (2 Cor 9:15).",That was about man's willingness to do good; this is about God's.,That was about men's willingness to give money to poor saints; this about God's willingness to give Christ Jesus his Son to the world.,"It was the thoughts of this redemption and salvation that made David say, 'Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name' (Psa 103:1).",O!,"they that are partakers of redeeming grace, and that have a throne of grace, a covenant of grace, and a Christ, that is the Son of God's love, to come to, and to live by, should be a thankful people.","'By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually,--giving thanks in his name' (Heb 13:15).","How many obligations has God laid upon his people, to give thanks to him at every remembrance of his holiness.",(2.),"Study the priesthood, the high priesthood of Jesus Christ, both the first and second part thereof.","The first part was that when he offered up himself without the gate, when he bare our sins in his own body on the tree.","The second part is that which he executeth there whither he is now gone, even in heaven itself, where the throne of grace is.","I say, study what Christ has done, and is adoing.",O!,what is he adoing now?,"he is sprinkling his blood with his priestly robes on, before the throne of grace; that is too little thought on by the saints of God: 'We have such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man' (Heb 8:1,2).","Busy thyself, fellow-Christian, about this blessed office of Christ.","It is full of good, it is full of sweet, it is full of heaven, it is full of relief and succour for the tempted and dejected; wherefore, I say again, study these things, give thyself wholly to them.",Sixth.,"Since God has prepared himself a lamb, a sacrifice, a priest, a throne of grace, and has bid thee come to him, come to him as there sitting; come, come boldly, as he bids thee.","What better warrant canst thou have to come, than to be bid to come of God?","When the goodman himself bids the beggar come to his house, then he may come, then he may come boldly; the consideration of the invitation doth encourage.","That we have our friend at court, should also make us come boldly.","Jesus, as has been showed, as sacrifice and high priest, is there, 'in whom we have boldness, and access with confidence by the faith of him' (Eph 3:12).","Again, 'By whom also we have access by faith into this grace, wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God' (Rom 5:2).","Again, 'We have boldness, brethren, to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus' (Heb 10:19,20).","What can be more plain, more encouraging, more comfortable to them that would obtain mercy, 'and find grace to help in time of need.'","It is a dishonour to God, disadvantage to thee, and an encouragement to Satan, when thou hangest back, and seemest afraid to 'come boldly unto the throne of grace.'","'Let us,' therefore, 'draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water; let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that promised, and let us consider one another, to provoke unto love and to good works' (Heb 10:22-24).",Farewell.,FOOTNOTES: 1.,"How many thousands rush into the presence of God with unholy, thoughtless familiarity, by repeating the form called the Lord's prayer.",His infinite holiness should make us tremblingly apply to his throne of grace.,"In the name of the Redeemer, and in his mediation alone, the sinner can find access, and be emboldened to draw nigh and receive grace to help in our everyday time of need.--Ed.",2.,"'Though the phrase, ""throne of grace,"" be only once named in the Bible, yet the thing signified is so savoury, significant, and suitable, that this form of speaking is become famous among Christians, and will be used to the end of time.'--Traill.--Ed.",3.,"This is an allusion to Jeremiah 18:1-10 the potter and his wheel, upon which he forms his vessels of clay to honour or to dishonour as he pleaseth.","So God worketh all things according to his will, all tending to the good of his church, because his resting-place is the mercy-seat.--Ed.",4.,Quoted from the Genevan or puritan version.--Ed.,5.,"'Grace was poured so plentifully from heaven, that it did not only countervail sin, but above measure passeth it.'",Note to the Genevan Bible.--Ed.,6.,"Not by the person or body, but mentally.","It matters little whether the body is sitting, kneeling, or standing;

JOHN BUNYAN, OF BEDFORD.",WITH A PREFACE PREFIXED THEREUNTO BY AN EMINENT MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL IN LONDON.,"London: Sold by George Larkin, at the Two Swans without Bishopgates, 1692.",ADVERTISEMENT BY THE EDITOR.,"The very excellent preface to this treatise, written by George Cokayn, will inform the reader of the melancholy circumstances under which it was published, and of the author's intention, and mode of treatment.","Very little more need be said, by way of introducing to our readers this new edition of Bunyan's Excellency of a Broken Heart.","George Cokayn was a gospel minister in London, who became eventually connected with the Independent denomination.","He was a learned man--brought up at the university--had preached before the House of Commons--was chaplain to that eminent statesman and historian, Whitelocke--was rector of St. Pancras, Soper Lane--remarkable for the consistency of his conduct and piety of his life--but as he dared not to violate his conscience, by conformity to ceremonies or creeds which he deemed antichristian, he suffered under persecution, and, with upwards of two thousand godly ministers, was ejected from his living, and thrown upon the care of Divine Providence for daily food.","The law ordered him to be silent, and not to set forth the glories of his Saviour; but his heavenly Father had ordained him to preach.",There was no hesitation as to whom he would obey.,"At the risk of imprisonment, transportation, and death, he preached; and God honoured his ministry, and he became the founder of a flourishing church in Hare Court, London.","His preface bears the date of September, 1688; and, at a good old age, he followed Bunyan to the celestial city, in 1689.","It is painful to find the author's Baptist friends keeping aloof because of his liberal sentiments; but it is delightful to witness the hearty affection with which an Independent minister recommends the work of a Baptist; and truly refreshing to hear so learned a man commending most earnestly the work of a poor, unlettered, but gigantic brother in the ministry.",Surely there is water enough connected with that controversy to quench any unholy fire that differences of opinion might ignite.,George Cokayn appears to have possessed much a kindred spirit with John Bunyan.,Some of his expressions are remarkably Bunyanish.,"Thus, when speaking of the jailor, 'who was a most barbarous, hard-hearted wretch; yet, when God came to deal with him, he was soon tamed, and his heart became exceeding soft and tender.'","And when alluding to the Lord's voice, in softening the sinner's heart, he says: 'This is a glorious work indeed, that hearts of stone should be dissolved and melted into waters of godly sorrow, working repentance.'","The subject of a broken heart is one of vital importance, because it is essential to salvation.","The heart, by nature, is hard, and cannot, and will not break itself.",Angels have no power to perform this miracle of mercy and of justice.,It is the work of the Holy Spirit in the NEW BIRTH.,"Some have supposed that God always prepares the heart for this solemn, this important change, by a stroke of his providence; but it is not so.",Who dares limit the Almighty?,"He takes his own way with the sinner--one by a whisper, another by a hurricane.","Some are first alarmed by the preaching of the Word--many by conversation with a pious friend or neighbour; some by strokes of Providence--but all are led to a prayerful searching of the holy oracles, until there, by the enlightening influence of the Spirit, they find consolation.","The great question is, not as to the means, but the fact--Have I been born again?",Have I been grafted into Christ?,"Do I bring forth the fruits of godliness in mourning over my sins, and, in good words and works, am I a living epistle known and read of all--men, angels, devils--and of the Omniscient God?","These are the all-important inquiries which, I trust, will deeply influence every reader.","Let two of Bunyan's remarks make an indelible impression on every mind: 'God will break ALL hearts for sin, either here to repentance and happiness, or in the world to come to condemnation and misery.'","'Consider thou must die but once; I mean but once as to this world, for if thou, when thou goest hence, dost not die well, thou canst not come back again and die better.'","May our spirits be baptized into these solemn truths, and our broken hearts be an acceptable sacrifice to God.",GEO.,OFFOR.,A PREFACE TO THE READER.,"The author of the ensuing discourse--now with God, reaping the fruit of all his labour, diligence, and success, in his Master's service--did experience in himself, through the grace of God, the nature, excellency, and comfort of a truly broken and contrite spirit.","So that what is here written is but a transcript out of his own heart: for God--who had much work for him to do--was still hewing and hammering him by his Word, and sometimes also by more than ordinary temptations and desertions.","The design, and also the issue thereof, through God's goodness, was the humbling and keeping of him low in his own eyes.","The truth is, as himself sometimes acknowledged, he always needed the thorn in the flesh, and God in mercy sent it him, lest, under his extraordinary circumstances, he should be exalted about measure; which perhaps was the evil that did more easily beset him than any other.","But the Lord was pleased to overrule it, to work for his good, and to keep him in that broken frame which is so acceptable unto him, and concerning which it is said, that 'He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds' (Psa 147:3).","And, indeed, it is a most necessary qualification that should always be found in the disciples of Christ, who are most eminent, and as stars of the first magnitude in the firmament of the church.","Disciples, in the highest form of profession, need to be thus qualified in the exercise of every grace, and the performance of every duty.","It is that which God doth principally and more especially look after, in all our approaches and accesses to him.","It is to him that God will look, and with him God will dwell, who is poor, and of a contrite spirit (Isa 57:15, 66:2).","And the reason why God will manifest so much respect to one so qualified, is because he carries it so becomingly towards him.","He comes and lies at his feet, and discovers a quickness of sense, and apprehensiveness of whatever may be dishonourable and distasteful to God (Psa 38:4).","And if the Lord doth at any time but shake his rod over him, he comes trembling, and kisses the rod, and says, 'It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good' (1 Sam 3:18).","He is sensible he hath sinned and gone astray like a lost sheep, and, therefore, will justify God in his severest proceedings against him.","This broken heart is also a pliable and flexible heart, and prepared to receive whatsoever impressions God shall make upon it, and is ready to be moulded into any frame that shall best please the Lord.","He says, with Samuel, 'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth' (1 Sam 3:10).","And with David, 'When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek' (Psa 27:8).","And so with Paul, who tremblingly said, 'Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?'",(Acts 9:6).,"Now, therefore, surely such a heart as this is must needs be very delightful to God.","He says to us, 'My son, give me thine heart' (Prov 23:26).","But, doubtless, he means there a broken heart: an unbroken heart we may keep to ourselves; it is the broken heart which God will have us to give to him; for, indeed, it is all the amends that the best of us are capable of making, for all the injury we have done to God in sinning against him.","We are not able to give better satisfaction for breaking God's laws, than by breaking our own hearts; this is all that we can do of that kind; for the blood of Christ only must give the due and full satisfaction to the justice of God for what provocations we are at any time guilty of; but all that we can do is to accompany the acknowledgments we make of miscarriages with a broken and contrite spirit.","Therefore we find, that when David had committed those two foul sins of adultery and murder, against God, he saw that all his sacrifices signified nothing to the expiating of his guilt; therefore he brings to God a broken heart, which carried in it the best expression of indignation against himself, as of the highest respect he could show to God (2 Cor 7:11).","The day in which we live, and the present circumstances which the people of God and these nations are under, do loudly proclaim a very great necessity of being in this broken and tender frame; for who can foresee what will be the issue of these violent fermentations that are amongst us?",Who knows what will become of the ark of God?,Therefore it is a seasonable duty with old Eli to sit trembling for it.,"Do we not also hear the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of wars; and ought we not, with the prophet, to cry out, 'My bowels, my bowels!","I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me, I cannot hold my peace,' &c. (Jer 4:19).","Thus was that holy man affected with the consideration of what might befall Jerusalem, the temple and ordinances of God, &c., as the consequence of the present dark dispensations they were under.",Will not a humble posture best become us when we have humbling providences in prospect?,"Mercy and judgment seem to be struggling in the same womb of providence; and which will come first out we know not; but neither of them can we comfortably meet, but with a broken and a contrite spirit.","If judgment comes, Josiah's posture of tenderness will be the best we can be found in; and also to say, with David, 'My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments' (Psa 119:120).","It is very sad when God smites, and we are not grieved; which the prophet complains of, 'Thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved,' &c. 'They have made their faces harder than a rock, they have refused to return' (Jer 5:3).","But such as know the power of his anger will have a deep awe of God upon their hearts, and, observing him in all his motions, will have the greatest apprehensions of his displeasure.","So that when he is coming forth in any terrible dispensation, they will, according to their duty, prepare to meet him with a humble and broken heart.","But if he should appear to us in his goodness, and farther lengthen out the day of our peace and liberty, yet still the contrite frame will be most seasonable; then will be a proper time, with Job, to abhor ourselves in dust and ashes, and to say, with David, 'Who am I that thou hast brought me hitherto'!",(Job 42:6; 2 Sam 7:18).,"But we must still know that this broken tender heart is not a plant that rows in our own soil, but is the peculiar gift of God himself.",He that made the heart must break the heart.,"We may be under heart-breaking providences, and yet the heart remain altogether unbroken; as it was with Pharaoh, whose heart, though it was under the hammers of ten terrible judgments, immediately succeeding one another, yet continued hardened against God.","The heart of man is harder than hardness itself, till God softeneth and breaks it.","Men move not, they relent not, let God thunder never so terribly; let God, in the greatest earnest, cast abroad his firebrands, arrows, and death, in the most dreadful representations of wrath and judgment, yet still man trembles not, nor is any more astonished than if in all this God were but in jest, till he comes and falls to work with him, and forces him to cry out, What have I done?",What shall I do?,"Therefore let us have recourse to him, who, as he gives the new heart, so also therewith the broken heart.","And let men's hearts be never so hard, if God comes once to deal effectually with them, they shall become mollified and tender; as it was with those hardened Jews who, by wicked and cruel hands, murdered the Lord of life: though they stouted it out a great while, yet how suddenly, when God brought them under the hammer of his Word and Spirit, in Peter's powerful ministry, were they broken, and, being pricked in their hearts, cried out, 'Men and brethren, what shall we do?'",(Acts 2:37).,"And the like instance we have in the jailor, who was a most barbarous, hard-hearted wretch; yet, when God came to deal with him, he was soon tamed, and his heart became exceeding soft and tender (Acts 16:29,30).","Men may speak long enough, and the heart not at all be moved; but 'The voice of the Lord is powerful, the voice of the Lord is full of majesty,' and breaketh the rocks and cedars (Psa 29:4).","He turns 'the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters' (Psa 114:8).","And this is a glorious work indeed, that hearts of stone should be dissolved and melted into waters of godly sorrow, working repentance not to be repented of (2 Cor 7:10).",When God speaks effectually the stoutest heart must melt and yield.,"Wait upon God, then, for the softening thy heart, and avoid whatsoever may be a means of hardening it; as the apostle cautions the Hebrews, 'Take heed,--lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin' (Heb 3:13).","Sin is deceitful, and will harden all those that indulge it.","The more tender any man is to his lust, the more will he be hardened by it.","There is a native hardness in every man's heart; and though it may be softened by gospel means, yet if those means be afterwards neglected, the heart will fall to its native hardness again: as it is with the wax and the clay.","Therefore, how much doth it behove us to keep close to God, in the use of all gospel-means, whereby our hearts being once softened, may be always kept so; which is best done by repeating the use of those means which were at first blessed for the softening of them.","The following treatise may be of great use to the people of God--through his blessing accompanying it--to keep their hearts tender and broken, when so many, after their hardness and impenitent heart, are treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath (Rom 2:5).","O let none who peruse this book herd with that generation of hardened ones, but be a companion of all those that mourn in Zion and whose hearts are broken for their own, the church's, and the nation's provocations; who, indeed, are the only likely ones that will stand in the gap to divert judgments.","When Shishak, king of Egypt, with a great host, came up against Judah, and having taken their frontier fenced cities, they sat down before Jerusalem, which put them all under a great consternation; but the king and princes upon this humbled themselves; the Lord sends a gracious message to them by Shemaiah the prophet, the import whereof was, That because they humbled themselves, the Lord would not destroy them, nor pour out his wrath upon them, by the hand of Shishak (2 Chron 12:5-7).","The greater the party is of mourning Christians, the more hope we have that the storm impending may be blown over, and the blessings enjoyed may yet be continued.","As long as there is a sighing party we may hope to be yet preserved; at least, such will have the mark set upon themselves which shall distinguish them from those whom the slaughtermen shall receive commission to destroy (Eze 9:4-6).","But I shall not further enlarge the porch, as designing to make way for the reader's entrance into the house, where I doubt not but he will be pleased with the furniture and provision he finds in it.","And I shall only further assure him, that this whole book was not only prepared for, but also put into, the press by the author himself, whom the Lord was pleased to remove--to the great loss and unexpressible grief of many precious souls--before the sheets could be all wrought off.","And now, as I hinted in the beginning, that what was transcribed out of the author's heart into the book, may be transcribed out of the book into the hearts of all who shall peruse it, is the desire and prayer of A lover and honourer of all saints as such, George Cokayn September 21, 1688 THE ACCEPTABLE SACRIFICE; OR, THE EXCELLENCY OF A BROKEN HEART.","'THE SACRIFICES OF GOD ARE A BROKEN SPIRIT: A BROKEN AND A CONTRITE HEART, O GOD, THOU WILT NOT DESPISE.'",--Psalm 51:17 This psalm is David's penitential psalm.,"It may be fitly so called, because it is a psalm by which is manifest the unfeigned sorrow which he had for his horrible sin, in defiling of Bathsheba, and slaying Uriah her husband; a relation at large of which you have in the 11th and 12th of the Second of Samuel.","Many workings of heart, as this psalm showeth, this poor man had, so soon as conviction did fall upon his spirit.","One while he cries for mercy, then he confesses his heinous offences, then he bewails the depravity of his nature; sometimes he cries out to be washed and sanctified, and then again he is afraid that God will cast him away from his presence, and take his Holy Spirit utterly from him.","And thus he goes on till he comes to the text, and there he stayeth his mind, finding in himself that heart and spirit which God did not dislike; 'The sacrifices of God,' says he, 'are a broken spirit'; as if he should say, I thank God I have that.","'A broken and a contrite heart,' says he, 'O God, thou wilt not despise'; as if he should say, I thank God I have that.",[I.,THE TEXT OPENED IN THE MANY WORKINGS OF THE HEART.],The words consist of two parts.,FIRST.,An assertion.,SECOND.,A demonstration of that assertion.,"The assertion is this, 'The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.'","The demonstration is this, 'Because a broken and a contrite heart God will not despise.'",In the assertion we have two things present themselves to our consideration.,First.,That a broken spirit is to God a sacrifice.,Second.,"That it is to God, as that which answereth to, or goeth beyond, all sacrifices.",'The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.',The demonstration of this is plain: for that heart God will not despise it.,"'A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.'","Whence I draw this conclusion: That a spirit rightly broken, a heart truly contrite, is to God an excellent thing.","That is, a thing that goeth beyond all external duties whatever; for that is intended by this saying, The sacrifices, because it answereth to all sacrifices which we can offer to God; yea it serveth in the room of all: all our sacrifices without this are nothing; this alone is all.",There are four things that are very acceptable to God.,The First is The sacrifice of the body of Christ for our sins.,"Of this you read (Heb 10) for there you have it preferred to all burnt-offerings and sacrifices; it is this that pleaseth God; it is this that sanctifieth, and so setteth the people acceptable in the sight of God.",Second.,"Unfeigned love to God is counted better than all sacrifices, or external parts of worship.","'And to love him [the Lord thy God] with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices' (Mark 12:33).",Third.,"To walk holily and humbly, and obediently, towards and before God, is another.","Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord?--'Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice; and to hearken than the fat of rams' (Micah 6:6-8; 1 Sam 15:22).",Fourth.,"And this in our text is the fourth: 'The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.'","But note by the way, that this broken, this broken and contrite heart, is thus excellent only to God: 'O God,' saith he, 'THOU wilt not despise it.'","By which is implied, the world have not this esteem or respect for such a heart, or for one that is of a broken and a contrite spirit.","No, no, a man, a woman, that is blessed with a broken heart, is so far off from getting by that esteem with the world, that they are but burdens and trouble houses wherever they are or go.","Such people carry with them molestation and disquietment: they are in carnal families as David was to the king of Gath, troublers of the house (1 Sam 21).","Their sighs, their tears, their day and night groans, their cries and prayers, and solitary carriages, put all the carnal family out of order.","[1] Hence you have them brow-beaten by some, contemned by others, yea, and their company fled from and deserted by others.","But mark the text, 'A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise,' but rather accept; for not to despise is with God to esteem and set a high price upon.",[II.,"THE DOCTRINE, ASSERTION, DEMONSTRATION, AND CONCLUSION, THAT A BROKEN AND TRULY CONTRITE HEART IS AN EXCELLENT HEART.]","But we will demonstrate by several particulars, that a broken spirit, a spirit RIGHTLY broken, an heart TRULY contrite, is to God an excellent thing.",First.,"This is evident from the comparison, 'Thou desirest not sacrifice, else would I give it, thou delightest not in burnt-offering.","The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,' &c. Mark, he rejecteth sacrifices, offerings and sacrifices: that is, all Levitical ceremonies under the law, and all external performances under the gospel; but accepteth a broken heart.","It is therefore manifest by this, were there nothing else to be said, that proves, that a heart rightly broken, a heart truly contrite, is to God an excellent thing; for as you see such a heart is set before all sacrifice; and yet they were the ordinances of God, and things that he commanded; but lo, a broken spirit is above them all, a contrite heart goes beyond them, yea, beyond them when put all together.","Thou wilt not have the one, thou wilt not despise the other.","O brethren, a broken and a contrite heart is an excellent thing.","Have I said a broken heart, a broken and a contrite heart is esteemed above all sacrifices; I will add, Second.",It is of greater esteem with God than is either heaven or earth; and that is more than to be set before external duties.,"'Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool, where is the house that ye build unto me?",and where is the place of my rest?,"For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word' (Isa 66:1,2).","Mark, God saith, he hath made all these things, but he doth not say, that he will look to them, that is, take complacency and delight in them; no, there is that wanting in all that he hath made that should take up and delight his heart.","But now, let a broken-hearted sinner come before him; yea, he ranges the world throughout to find out such an one, and having found him, 'To this man,' saith he, 'will I look.'","I say again, that such a man to him is of more value than is either heaven or earth; 'They,' saith he, 'shall wax old'; 'they shall perish' and vanish away; but this man he continues: he, as is presented to us in another place, under another character, 'he shall abide for ever' (Heb 1:10-12; 1 John 2:17).","'To this man will I look,' with this man will I be delighted; for so to look doth sometimes signify.","'Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse,' saith Christ to his humble-hearted, 'thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes' (Cant 4:9).",While it is as a conduit to let the rivers out of thy broken heart.,"I am taken, saith he, 'with one chain of thy neck' (Can 4:9).","Here you see he looks and is ravished, he looks and is taken, as it saith in another place, 'The king is held in the galleries'; that is, is taken with his beloved, with the dove's eyes of his beloved, with the contrite spirit of his people (Cant 7:5, 1:15).","But it is not thus reported of him with respect to heaven or earth: them he sets more lightly by, them he 'reserves unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men' (2 Peter 3:7), but the broken in heart are his beloved, his jewels.","Wherefore, what I have said as to this must go for the truth of God, to wit, That a broken-hearted sinner, a sinner with a contrite spirit, is of more esteem with God than is either heaven or earth.","He saith he hath made them, but he doth not say he will look to them.","He saith they are his throne and footstool, but he doth not say they have taken or ravished his heart.","No, it is those that are of a contrite spirit do this.","But there is yet more in the words, 'To this man will I look': that is, For this man will I care, about this man will I camp, I will put this man under my protection; for so to look to one doth sometimes signify; and I take the meaning in this place to be such (Prov 27:23; Jer 39:12, 40:4).","'The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down' (Psa 145:14).","And the broken-hearted are of this number; wherefore he careth for, campeth about, and hath set his eyes upon such an one for good.","This, therefore, is a second demonstration to prove, that the man that hath his spirit rightly broken, his heart truly contrite, is of great esteem with God.",Third.,"Yet further, God doth not only prefer such an one, as has been said, before heaven and earth, but he loveth, he desireth to have that man for an intimate, for a companion; he must dwell; he must cohabit with him that is of a broken heart, with such as are of a contrite spirit.","'For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy, I will dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit' &c. (Isa 57:15).","Behold here both the majesty and condescension of the high and lofty One; his majesty, in that he is high, and the inhabiter of eternity; 'I am the high and lofty One,' saith he, 'I inhabit eternity.'",Verily this consideration is enough to make the broken-hearted man creep into a mouse-hole to hide himself from such a majesty!,"But behold his heart, his condescending mind; I am for dwelling also with him that hath a broken heart, with him that is of a contrite spirit; that is the man that I would converse with, that is the man with whom I will cohabit; that is, he, saith God, I will choose for my companion.","For to desire to dwell with one supposeth all these things; and verily, of all the men in the world, none have acquaintance with God, none understand what communion with him, and what his teachings mean, but such as are of a broken and contrite heart.",'He is nigh unto them that are of a broken spirit' (Psa 34:18).,"These are they intended in the 14th Psalm, where it is said, 'The Lord looked down from heaven,--to see if any did understand and seek God'; that he might find some body in the world with whom he might converse; for indeed there is none else that either understand, or that can tend to hearken to him.","God, as I may say, is forced to break men's hearts, before he can make them willing to cry to him, or be willing that he should have any concerns with them; the rest shut their eyes, stop their ears, withdraw their hearts, or say unto God, Be gone (Job 21:14).","But now the broken in heart can tend it; he has leisure, yea, leisure, and will, and understanding, and all; and therefore is a fit man to have to do with God.","There is room also in this man's house, in this man's heart, in this man's spirit, for God to dwell, for God to walk, for God to set up a kingdom.","Here, therefore, is suitableness.","'Can two walk together,' saith God, 'except they be agreed?'",(Amos 3:3).,The broken-hearted desireth God's company; when wilt thou come unto me?,saith he.,The broken-hearted loveth to hear God speak and talk to him.,Here is a suitableness.,"'Make me,' saith he, 'to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice' (Psa 51:8).","But here lies the glory, in that the high and lofty One, the God that inhabiteth eternity, and that was a high and holy place for his habitation, should choose to dwell with, and to be a companion of the broken in heart, and of them that are of a contrite spirit.","Yea, and here also is great comfort for such.",Fourth.,"God doth not only prefer such a heart before all sacrifices, nor esteems such a man above heaven and earth; nor yet only desire to be of his acquaintance, but he reserveth for him his chief comforts, his heart-reviving and soul-cherishing cordials."
