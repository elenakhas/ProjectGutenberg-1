and many will think that in this poem and elsewhere I have spoken of the author of _Paradise Lost_ in a strain of panegyric scarcely justifiable by the tenor of some of his opinions, whether theological or political, and by the temper he carried into public affairs, in which, unfortunately for his genius, he was so much concerned.--I.F.]","Thick as autumnal leaves that strew the brooks     In Vallombrosa, where Etrurian shades     High over-arch’d embower.",PARADISE LOST.,"[146]     “Vallombrosa--I longed in thy shadiest wood     To slumber, reclined on the moss-covered floor!”[147]     Fond wish that was granted at last, and the Flood,     That lulled me asleep, bids me listen once more.",Its murmur how soft!,"as it falls down the steep,                   5     Near that Cell--yon sequestered Retreat high in air--[148]     Where our Milton was wont lonely vigils to keep     For converse with God, sought through study and prayer.","The Monks still repeat the tradition with pride,     And its truth who shall doubt?","for his Spirit is here;[149]       10     In the cloud-piercing rocks doth her grandeur abide,     In the pines pointing heavenward her beauty austere;

the _natural_ woods of the region of Vallombrosa _are_ deciduous, and spread to a great extent; those near the convent are, indeed, mostly pines; but they are avenues of trees _planted_ within a few steps of each other, and thus composing large tracts of wood;

    And, kindling at their lustre, if I burn,     My noble fire emits the joyful ray     That through the realms of glory shines for aye.",[156] The second of the two sonnets translated by Wordsworth is No.,lxxiii.,in Signor Cesare Guastî’s edition of Michael Angelo (1863).,AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS.,_Scaro d’un’ importuna._ It was evidently written in old age.,The following is Mr. John Addington Symond’s translation of the same sonnet.,"Freed from a burden sore and grievous band,       Dear Lord, and from this wearying world untied,       Like a frail bark I turn me to Thy side,       As from a fierce storm to a tranquil land.","Thy thorns, Thy nails, and either bleeding hand,       With Thy mild gentle piteous face, provide       Promise of help and mercies multiplied,       And hope that yet my soul secure may stand.","Let not Thy holy eyes be just to see       My evil part, Thy chastened ears to hear,       And stretch the arm of judgment to my crime:     Let Thy blood only love and succour me,       Yielding more perfect pardon, better cheer,       As older still I grow with lengthening time.","_The Sonnets of Michael Angelo Buonarroti and Tomaso Campanella_, by John Addington Symonds, p. 110.",Compare Wordsworth’s translation of other three sonnets by Michael Angelo (vol.,iii.,pp.,380-384).--ED.,XXII AT FLORENCE--FROM M.

There is one of these floating islands in Loch Lomond in Argyll, another in Loch Dochart in Perthshire, and another in Loch Treig in Inverness.","Their origin is probably due to a mass of peat being detached from the shore, and floated out into the lake.","A mass of vegetable matter, however, has sometimes risen from the bottom of the water, and assumed for a time all the appearance of an island.","This has been probably due to an accumulation of gas, within or under the detached portion, produced by the decay of vegetation in extremely hot weather.","Southey, in an unpublished letter to Sir George Beaumont (10th July 1824), thus describes the Island at Derwentwater: “You will have seen by the papers that the Floating Island has made its appearance.","It sank again last week, when some heavy rains had raised the lake four feet.","By good fortune Professor Sedgewick happened to be in Keswick, and examined it in time.","Where he probed it a thin layer of mud lies upon a bed of peat, which is six feet thick, and this rests upon a stratum of fine white clay,--the same I believe which Miss Barker found in Borrowdale when building her unlucky house.","Where the gas is generated remains yet to be discovered, but when the peat is filled with this gas, it separates from the clay and becomes buoyant.","There must have been a considerable convulsion when this took place, for a rent was made in the bottom of the lake, several feet in depth, and not less than fifty yards long, on each side of which the bottom rose and floated.",It was a pretty sight to see the small fry exploring this new made strait and darting at the bubbles which rose as the Professor was probing the bank.,"The discharge of air was considerable here, when a pole was thrust down.","But at some distance where the rent did not extend, the bottom had been heaved up in a slight convexity, sloping equally in an inclined plane all round: and there, when the pole was introduced, a rush like a jet followed, as it was withdrawn.","The thing is the more curious, because as yet no example of it is known to have been observed in any other place.” Another of these detached islands used to float about in Esthwaite Water, and was carried from side to side of the pool at the north end of the lake--the same pool which the swans, described in _The Prelude_, used to frequent.",This island had a few bushes on it: but it became stranded some time ago.,"One of the old natives of Hawkeshead described the process of trying to float it off again, by tying ropes to the bushes on its surface,--an experiment which was unsuccessful.","Compare the reference to the Floating or “Buoyant” Island of Derwentwater, and to the “mossy islet” of Esthwaite, in Wordsworth’s _Guide through the District of the Lakes_.--ED.","“THE CRESCENT-MOON, THE STAR OF LOVE” Published 1842 One of the “Evening Voluntaries.”--Ed.","The Crescent-moon, the Star of Love,       Glories of evening, as ye there are seen       With but a span of sky between--       Speak one of you, my doubts remove,     Which is the attendant Page and which the Queen?","“_A POET!_--HE HATH PUT HIS HEART TO SCHOOL” Published 1842 [I was impelled to write this Sonnet by the disgusting frequency with which the word _artistical_, imported with other impertinences from the Germans, is employed by writers of the present day: for artistical let them substitute artificial, and the poetry written on this system, both at home and abroad, will be for the most part much better characterised.--I.F.]",One of the “Miscellaneous Sonnets.”--ED.,"_A Poet!_--He hath put his heart to school,     Nor dares to move unpropped upon the staff     Which Art hath lodged within his hand--must laugh     By precept only, and shed tears by rule.","Thy Art be Nature;

           10   His lips were moving; and his eyes, upraised to sue for grace,   With soft illumination cheered the dimness of that place.","How beautiful is holiness!--what wonder if the sight,   Almost as vivid as a dream, produced a dream at night?","It came with sleep and showed the Boy, no cherub, not transformed,  15   But the poor ragged Thing whose ways my human heart had warmed.","Me had the dream equipped with wings, so I took him in my arms,   And lifted from the grassy floor, stilling his faint alarms,   And bore him high through yielding air my debt of love to pay,   By giving him, for both our sakes, an hour of holiday.","20   I whispered, “Yet a little while, dear Child!","thou art my own,   To show thee some delightful thing, in country or in town.",What shall it be?,a mirthful throng?,"or that holy place and calm   St. Denis, filled with royal tombs,[228] or the Church of Notre      Dame?",[229]   “St.,Ouen’s golden Shrine?,"[230] Or choose what else would please      thee most                                                        25   Of any wonder Normandy, or all proud France, can boast!”   “My Mother,” said the Boy, “was born near to a blessèd Tree,   The Chapel Oak of Allonville;[231] good Angel, show it me!”   On wings, from broad and stedfast poise let loose by this reply,   For Allonville, o’er down and dale, away then did we fly;           30   O’er town and tower we flew, and fields in May’s fresh verdure      drest;   The wings they did not flag; the Child, though grave, was not      deprest.","But who shall show, to waking sense, the gleam of light that      broke   Forth from his eyes, when first the Boy looked down on that      huge oak,   For length of days so much revered, so famous where it stands       35   For twofold hallowing--Nature’s care, and work of human hands?","Strong as an Eagle with my charge I glided round and round   The wide-spread boughs, for view of door, window, and stair that      wound   Gracefully up the gnarled trunk; nor left we unsurveyed   The pointed steeple peering forth from the centre of the shade.","40   I lighted--opened with soft touch the chapel’s iron door,[232]   Past softly, leading in the Boy; and, while from roof to floor   From floor to roof all round his eyes the Child with wonder      cast,[233]   Pleasure on pleasure crowded in, each livelier than the last.","For, deftly framed within the trunk, the[234] sanctuary showed,     45   By light of lamp and precious stones, that glimmered here, there      glowed,   Shrine, Altar, Image, Offerings hung in sign of gratitude;

but there may be no harm in adverting here to particular feelings or _experiences_ of my own mind on which the structure of the poem partly rests.,Nothing was more difficult for me in childhood than to admit the notion of death as a state applicable to my own being.,"I have said elsewhere--                   A simple child,     That lightly draws its breath,     And feels its life in every limb,     What should it know of death!-- But it was not so much from feelings of animal vivacity that my difficulty came as from a sense of the indomitableness of the Spirit within me.","I used to brood over the stories of Enoch and Elijah, and almost to persuade myself that, whatever might become of others, I should be translated, in something of the same way, to heaven.","With a feeling congenial to this, I was often unable to think of external things as having external existence, and I communed with all that I saw as something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature.",Many times while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree to recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality.,At that time I was afraid of such processes.,"In later periods of life I have deplored, as we have all reason to do, a subjugation of an opposite character, and have rejoiced over the remembrances, as is expressed in the lines--               Obstinate questionings     Of sense and outward things,     Fallings from us, vanishings, etc.","To that dream-like vividness and splendour which invest objects of sight in childhood, every one, I believe, if he would look back, could bear testimony, and I need not dwell upon it here; but having in the poem regarded it as presumptive evidence of a prior state of existence, I think it right to protest against a conclusion, which has given pain to some good and pious persons, that I meant to inculcate such a belief.","It is far too shadowy a notion to be recommended to faith, as more than an element in our instincts of immortality.","But let us bear in mind that, though the idea is not advanced in revelation, there is nothing there to contradict it, and the fall of man presents an analogy in its favour.","Accordingly, a pre-existent state has entered into the popular creeds of many nations;

and it was subjected to frequent and careful revision.","No poem of Wordsworth’s bears more evident traces in its structure at once of inspiration and elaboration; of original flight of thought and _afflatus_ on the one hand, and on the other of careful sculpture and fastidious choice of phrase.",But it is remarkable that there are very few changes of text in the successive editions.,"Most of the alterations were made before 1815, and the omission of some feeble lines which originally stood in stanza viii.","in the editions of 1807 and 1815, was a great advantage in disencumbering the poem.","The main revision and elaboration of this Ode, however--an elaboration which suggests the passage of the glacier ice over the rocks of White Moss Common, where the poem was murmured out stanza by stanza--was all finished before it first saw the light in 1807.",In form it is irregular and original.,"And perhaps the most remarkable thing in its structure, is the frequent change of the keynote, and the skill and delicacy with which the transitions are made.",“The feet throughout are iambic.,The lines vary in length from the Alexandrine to the line with two accents.,"There is a constant ebb and flow in the full tide of song, but scarce two waves are alike.” (Hawes Turner, _Selections from Wordsworth_.)","In the “notes” to the _Selections_ just referred to on Immortality, there is an excellent commentary on this _Ode_, almost every line of which is worthy of minute analysis and study.",Some of the following are suggested by Mr. Turner’s notes.,(1) _The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep._ The morning breeze blowing from the fields that were dark during the hours of sleep.,"(2) --_But there’s a Tree, of many, one._ Compare Browning’s _May and Death_--     Only one little sight, one plant     Woods have in May, etc.","(3) _The Pansy at my feet_     _Doth the same tale repeat._ French “Pensée.” “Pansies, that’s for thoughts.” Ophelia in _Hamlet_.","(4) _Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting._ This thought Wordsworth owed, consciously or unconsciously, to Plato.","Though he tells us in the Fenwick note that he did not mean to _inculcate_ the belief, there is no doubt that he clung to the notion of a life pre-existing the present, on grounds similar to those on which he believed in a life to come.",But there are some differences in the way in which the idea commended itself to Plato and to Wordsworth.,"The stress was laid by Wordsworth on the effect of terrestrial life in putting the higher faculties to sleep, and making us “forget the glories we have known.” Plato, on the other hand, looked upon the mingled experiences of mundane life as inducing a gradual but slow remembrance (ἀνάμνεσις) of the past.","Compare Tennyson’s _Two Voices_, and Wordsworth’s sonnet, beginning--     Man’s life is like a sparrow, mighty king.","(5) _Filling from time to time his “humorous stage”_     _With all the Persons,_ _i.e._ with the _dramatis personæ_.","(6) … _thou Eye among the blind,_     _That, deaf and silent, read’st the eternal deep._ There is an admirable parallel illustration of Wordsworth’s use of this figure (describing one sense in terms of another), in the lines in _Airey-Force Valley_--     A soft eye-music of slow-waving boughs.","(7) _Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight,_     _And custom lie upon thee with a weight,_     _Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!_ Compare with this, the lines in the fourth book of _The Excursion_, beginning--     Alas!","the endowment of immortal power     Is matched unequally with custom, time.","(8) _Fallings from us, vanishings._ The outward sensible universe, visible and tangible, seeming to fall away from us, as unreal, to vanish in unsubstantially.",See the explanation of this youthful experience in the Fenwick note.,"That confession of his boyish days at Hawkshead, “many times, while going to school, have I grasped at a wall or tree, _to recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality_” (by which he explains those--     Fallings from us, vanishings, etc.","), suggests a similar experience and confession of Cardinal Newman’s in his _Apologia_ (see p. 67).",The late Rev.,"Robert Perceval Graves, of Windermere, and afterwards of Dublin, wrote to me in 1850:--“I remember Mr. Wordsworth saying, that at a particular stage of his mental progress, he used to be frequently so rapt into an unreal transcendental world of ideas that the external world seemed no longer to exist in relation to him, and he _had to reconvince himself of its existence by clasping a tree, or something that happened to be near him_.","I could not help connecting this fact with that obscure passage in his great _Ode on the Intimations of Immortality_, in which he speaks of--         Those obstinate questionings     Of sense and outward things;     Fallings from us, vanishings; etc.” Professor Bonamy Price further confirms the explanation which Wordsworth gave of the passage, in a letter written to me in 1881, giving an account of a conversation he had with the poet, as follows:--                                          “OXFORD, _April 21, 1881_.","“MY DEAR SIR,--You will be glad, I am sure, to receive an     interpretation, which chance enabled me to obtain from     Wordsworth himself of a passage in the immortal _Ode on     Immortality_.…     “It happened one day that the poet, my wife, and I were taking     a walk together by the side of Rydal Water.",We were then by the     sycamores under Nab Scar.,"The aged poet was in a most genial     mood, and it suddenly occurred to me that I might, without     unwarrantable presumption, seize the golden opportunity thus     offered, and ask him to explain these mysterious words.","So     I addressed him with an apology, and begged him to explain,     what my own feeble mother-wit was unable to unravel, and for     which I had in vain sought the assistance of others, what     were those ‘fallings from us, vanishings,’ for which, above     all other things, he gave God thanks.","The venerable old man     raised his aged form erect; he was walking in the middle,     and passed across me to a five-barred gate in the wall which     bounded the road on the side of the lake.","He clenched the top     bar firmly with his right hand, pushed strongly against it,     and then uttered these ever-memorable words: ‘There was a time     in my life when I had to push against something that resisted,     to be sure that there was anything outside of me.","I was sure     of my own mind; everything else fell away, and vanished into     thought.’ Thought, he was sure of; matter for him, at the     moment, was an unreality--nothing but a thought.",Such natural     spontaneous idealism has probably never been felt by any other     man.,"“BONAMY PRICE.” This, however, was not an experience peculiar to Wordsworth, as Professor Price imagined--and its value would be much lessened if it had been so--but was one to which (as the poet said to Miss Fenwick) “every one, if he would look back, could bear testimony.” The following is from S.T.",Coleridge’s _Biographia Literaria_ (chap.,xxii.,"p. 29, edition 1817)-- “To the _Ode on the Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood_, the poet might have prefixed the lines which Dante addresses to one of his own Canzoni--     Canzone, i’ credo, che saranno radi     Color che tua ragione intendan bene:     Tanto lor sei faticoso ed alto.","O lyric song, there will be few, think I,     Who may thy import understand aright:     Thou art for them so arduous and so high!","But the Ode was intended for such readers only as had been accustomed to watch the flux and reflux of their inmost nature, to venture at times into the twilight realms of consciousness, and to feel a deep interest in modes of inmost being, to which they know that the attributes of time and space are inapplicable and alien, but which yet cannot be conveyed, save in symbols of time and space.","For such readers the sense is sufficiently plain, and they will be as little disposed to charge Mr. Wordsworth with believing the Platonic pre-existence in the ordinary interpretation of the words, as I am to believe, that Plato himself ever meant or taught it.",πολλά μοι ὑπ’ ἀγκῶνος ὠκέα βέλη     ἔνδον ἐντὶ φαρέτρας     φωνᾶντα συνετοῖσιν ἐς     δὲ τὸ πᾶν ἑρμηνέων     χατίζει.,σοφὸς ὁ πολλὰ εἰδὼς φυᾷ.,"μαθόντες δὲ λάβροι     παγγλωσσίᾳ, κόρακες ὥς,     ἄκραντα γαρύετον     Διὸς πρὸς ὄρνιχα θεῖον.","PINDAR, OLYMP.","ii.”[336] The following parallel passages from _The Excursion_, _The Prelude_, Ruskin’s _Modern Painters_, Keble’s _Praelectiones de Poeticae vi Medica_ (p. 788, Prael.",xxxix.,"), and the _Silex Scintillans_ of Henry Vaughan, are quoted, in an interesting note to the _Ode_ on Immortality, in Professor Henry Reed’s American edition of the Poems (1851).",I                       Ah!,"why in age     Do we revert so fondly to the walks     Of childhood--but that there the Soul discerns     The dear memorial footsteps unimpaired     Of her own native vigour--thence can hear     Reverberations; and a choral song,     Commingling with the incense that ascends,     Undaunted, toward the imperishable heavens,     From her own lonely altar?","_The Excursion_, book ix.",ll.,36-44.,"II                         Our childhood sits,     Our simple childhood, sits upon a throne     That hath more power than all the elements.","I guess not what this tells of Being past,     Nor what it augurs of the life to come; etc.","_The Prelude_, book v. ll.",507-511.,"III “ … There was never yet the child of any promise (so far as the theoretic faculties are concerned) but awaked to the sense of beauty with the first gleam of reason; and I suppose there are few, among those who love Nature otherwise than by profession and at second-hand, who look not back to their youngest and least learned days as those of the most intense, superstitious, insatiable, and beatific perception of her splendours.","And the bitter decline of this glorious feeling, though many note it not, partly owing to the cares and weight of manhood, which leave them not the time nor the liberty to look for their lost treasure, and partly to the human and divine affections which are appointed to take its place, yet have formed the subject, not indeed of lamentation, but of holy thankfulness for the witness it bears to the immortal origin and end of our nature, to one whose authority is almost without appeal in all questions relating to the influence of external things upon the pure human soul.","Not for these I raise       The song of thanks and praise     But for those obstinate questionings, etc.",etc.,"And if it were possible for us to recollect all the unaccountable and happy instincts of the careless time, and to reason upon them with the maturer judgment, we might arrive at more right results than either the philosophy or the sophisticated practice of art has yet attained.","But we love the perceptions before we are capable of methodising or comparing them.” (Ruskin’s _Modern Painters_, vol.",ii.,"p. 36, part iii.",ch.,v. sec.,i.),"“ … Etenim qui velit acutius indagare causas propensae in antiqua saecula voluntatis, mirum ni conjectura incidat aliquando in commentum illud Pythagorae, docentis, animarum nostrarum non tum fieri initium, cum in hoc mundo nascimur;

but I was called upon, among other scholars, to write verses upon the completion of the second century from the foundation of the school in 1585, by Archbishop Sandys.","These verses were much admired, far more than they deserved, for they were but a tame imitation of Pope’s versification, and a little in his style.","This exercise, however, put it into my head to compose verses from the impulse of my own mind; and I wrote, while yet a schoolboy, a long poem running upon my own adventures, and the scenery of the county in which I was brought up.” The _Summer Vacation_, and the _Return to School_, were destroyed by Wordsworth.--ED.","And has the Sun his flaming chariot driven     Two hundred times around the ring of heaven,     Since Science first, with all her sacred train,     Beneath yon roof began her heavenly reign?","While thus I mused, methought, before mine eyes,                   5     The Power of EDUCATION seemed to rise;

    Nor less to guide the fluctuating youth     Firm in the sacred paths of moral truth,     To regulate the mind’s disorder’d frame,     And quench the passions kindling into flame;                      80     The glimmering fires of Virtue to enlarge,     And purge from Vice’s dross my tender charge.","Oft have I said, the paths of Fame pursue,     And all that virtue dictates, dare to do;     Go to the world, peruse the book of man,                          85     And learn from thence thy own defects to scan;     Severely honest, break no plighted trust,     But coldly rest not here--be more than just;     Join to the rigours of the sires of Rome     The gentler manners of the private dome;                          90     When Virtue weeps in agony of woe,     Teach from the heart the tender tear to flow;     If Pleasure’s soothing song thy soul entice,     Or all the gaudy pomp of splendid Vice,     Arise superior to the Siren’s power,                              95     The wretch, the short-lived vision of an hour;     Soon fades her cheek, her blushing beauties fly,     As fades the chequer’d bow that paints the sky,       So shall thy sire, whilst hope his breast inspires,     And wakes anew life’s glimmering trembling fires,                100     Hear Britain’s sons rehearse thy praise with joy,     Look up to heaven, and bless his darling boy.","If e’er these precepts quell’d the passions’ strife,     If e’er they smooth’d the rugged walks of life,     If e’er they pointed forth the blissful way                      105     That guides the spirit to eternal day,     Do thou, if gratitude inspire thy breast,     Spurn the soft fetters of lethargic rest.","Awake, awake!","and snatch the slumbering lyre,     Let this bright morn and Sandys the song inspire.","110         I look’d obedience: the celestial Fair         Smiled like the morn, and vanished into air.",[339] This quotation I am unable to trace--ED.,"1792 (or earlier) “SWEET WAS THE WALK ALONG THE NARROW LANE” This sonnet is found in one of Dorothy Wordsworth’s letters to her friend Miss Jane Polland, written from Forncett Rectory, on 6th May 1792.",She wrote:-- “I promised to transcribe some of William’s compositions.,"As I made the promise I will give you a little sonnet, but all the same I charge you, as you value our friendship, not to read it, or to show it to any one--to your sister, or any other person.… I take the first that offers.",It is only valuable to me because the lane which gave birth to it was the favourite evening walk of my dear William and me.” … “I have not chosen this sonnet because of any particular beauty it has;

    Thence northward did they pass by Arthur’s seat,[346]     And Fairfield’s highest summit, on the right     Leaving St. Sunday’s Crag, to Grisdale tarn     They shot, and over that cloud-loving hill,     Seat-Sandal, a fond lover of the clouds;     Thence up Helvellyn, a superior mount,     With prospect underneath of Striding edge,     And Grisdale’s houseless vale, along the brink     Of Sheep-cot-cove, and those two other coves,     Huge skeletons of crags which from the coast     Of old Helvellyn spread their arms abroad     And make a stormy harbour for the winds.","Far went these shepherds in their devious quest,     From mountain ridges peeping as they passed     Down into every nook; …                             … and many a sheep     On height or bottom[347] did they see, in flocks     Or single.","And although it needs must seem     Hard to believe, yet could they well discern     Even at the utmost distance of two miles     (Such strength of vision to the shepherd’s eye     Doth practice give) that neither in the flocks     Nor in the single sheep was what they sought.","So to Helvellyn’s eastern side they went,     Down looking on that hollow, where the pool     Of Thirlmere flashes like a warrior’s shield     His light high up among the gloomy rocks,     With sight of now and then a straggling gleam     On Armath’s[348] pleasant fields.","And now they came,     To that high spring which bears no human name,     As one unknown by others, aptly called     The fountain of the mists.","The father stooped     To drink of the clear water, laid himself     Flat on the ground, even as a boy might do,     To drink of the cold well.","When in like sort     His son had drunk, the old man said to him     That now he might be proud, for he that day     Had slaked his thirst out of a famous well,     The highest fountain known on British land.","Thence, journeying on a second time, they passed     Those small flat stones, which, ranged by traveller’s hands     In cyphers on Helvellyn’s highest ridge,     Lie loose on the bare turf, some half-o’ergrown     By the grey moss, but not a single stone     Unsettled by a wanton blow from foot     Of shepherd, man or boy.","They have respect     For strangers who have travelled far perhaps,     For men who in such places, feeling there     The grandeur of the earth, have left inscribed     Their epitaph, which rain and snow     And the strong wind have reverenced.","…       But soon as Luke, full ten years old, could stand     Against the mountain blasts, and to the heights     Not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways,     He with his Father daily went, and they     Were as companions, why should I relate     That objects which the shepherd lov’d before     Were dearer now?","that from the Boy there came     Feelings and emanations, things which were     Light to the sun and music to the wind;     And that the old man’s heart seem’d born again?","Thus in his Father’s sight the Boy grew up;     And now when he had reached his eighteenth year,     He was his comfort and his daily hope.","…     Though often thus industriously they passed[349]     Whole hours with but small interchange of speech,     Yet were there times in which they did not want     Discourse both wise and pleasant,[350] shrewd remarks     Of moral prudence,[351] clothed in images     Lively and beautiful, in rural forms,     That made their conversation fresh and fair     As is a landscape; and the shepherd oft     Would draw out of his heart the mysteries[352]     And admirations that were there, of God     And of his works: or, yielding to the bent     Of his peculiar humour, would let loose     His tongue, and give it the wind’s freedom;

and all that time the boy     Was busy in his search, until at length     He spied the sheep upon a plot of grass,     An island in the brook.","It was a place     Remote and deep, piled round with rocks, where foot     Of man or beast was seldom used to tread.","But now, when everywhere the summer grass     Began to fail, this sheep by hunger pressed     Had left his fellows, made his way alone     To the green plot of pasture in the brook.","Before the boy knew well what he had seen     He leapt upon the island, with proud heart,     And with a shepherd’s joy.","Immediately     The sheep sprang forward to the further shore,     And was borne headlong by the roaring flood.","At this the boy looked round him, and his heart     Fainted with fear.","Thrice did he turn his face     To either bank, nor could he summon up     The courage that was needful to leap back     ’Cross the tempestuous torrent; so he stood     A prisoner on the island, not without     More than one thought of death, and his last hour.","Meantime the father had returned alone     To his own home, and now at the approach     Of evening he went forth to meet his son,     Nor could he guess the cause for which the boy     Had stayed so long.","The shepherd took his way     Up his own mountain grounds, where, as he walked     Along the steep that overhung the brook,     He seemed to hear a voice, which was again     Repeated, like the whistling of a kite.","At this, not knowing why--as often-times     The old man afterwards was heard to say--     Down to the brook he went, and tracked its course     Upwards among the o’erhanging rocks; nor     Had he gone far ere he espied the boy     Right in the middle of the roaring stream.","Without distress or fear the shepherd heard     The outcry of his son: he stretched his staff     Towards him, bade him leap, which word scarce said     The boy was safe.…     … Of Michael it is said--     No doubt if you in terms direct had asked     Whether he loved the mountains, true it is     That with blunt repetition of your words     He might have stared at you, and said that they     Were frightful to behold, but had you then     Discoursed with him …     Of his own business, and the goings on     Of earth and sky, then truly had you seen     That in his thoughts there were obscurities,     Wonder, and admiration, things that wrought     Not less than a religion in his heart.","And if it was his fortune to converse     With any who could talk of common things     In an unusual way, and give to them     Unusual aspects, or by questions apt     Wake sudden recognitions, that were like     Creations in the mind (and were indeed     Creations often), then when he discoursed     Of mountain sights, this untaught shepherd stood     Before the man with whom he so conversed     And looked at him as with a poet’s eye.","But speaking of the vale in which he dwelt,     And those bare rocks, if you had asked if he     For other pastures would exchange the same     And dwell elsewhere, …                           … you then had seen     At once what spirit of love was in his heart.","…     I have related that this Shepherd loved     The fields and mountains, not alone for this     That from his very childhood he had lived     Among them, with a body hale and stout,     And with a vigorous mind …                               … But exclude     Such reasons, and he had less cause to love     His native vale and patrimonial fields     Than others have, for Michael had liv’d on     Childless, until the time when he began     To look towards the shutting in of life.","In this MS. book there are also some of the original stanzas of _Ruth_, with a few variations of text.--ED.","[345] Compare the first line of those _Written with a Slate Pencil upon a Stone, the largest of a Heap lying near a deserted Quarry, upon one of the Islands at Rydal_, vol.",ii.,p.,63.--ED.,[346] Stone Arthur.,"See, in the “Poems on the Naming of Places,” the one beginning--     There is an Eminence, ED.",[347] Bottom is a common Cumbrian word for valley.--ED.,"[348] Armboth, on the western side of Thirlmere.--ED.","[349] Though in these occupations they would pass† [350] … prudent, …† [351] Of daily Providence …† [352] … obscurities† [353] Day-dreams, thoughts, and schemes.† † These variants occur in a letter of Dorothy Wordsworth to Thomas Poole.--ED.","[354] All doubt as to these fragments being originally intended to form part of _Michael_ is set at rest by a letter from Wordsworth to Thomas Poole, of Nether Stowey, written from Grasmere on the 9th of April 1801, in which he gives first some new lines to be added to _Michael_, at pp.",210 and 211 of vol.,ii.,of the “Lyrical Ballads” (ed.,"1800);

interrupted in going through the town of Staindrop, finished it about two miles and a-half beyond Staindrop.","He did not feel the jogging of the horse while he was writing; but, when he had done, he felt the effect of it.… So much for _The Glowworm_.","It was written coming from Middleham, on Monday, April 12, 1802.”--ED.","Among all lovely things my Love had been;     Had noted well the stars, all flowers that grew     About her home; but she had never seen     A glow-worm, never one, and this I knew.","While riding near her home one stormy night                        5     A single glow-worm did I chance to espy;     I gave a fervent welcome to the sight,     And from my horse I leapt; great joy had I.","Upon a leaf the glow-worm did I lay,     To bear it with me through the stormy night:                      10     And, as before, it shone without dismay;     Albeit putting forth a fainter light.","When to the dwelling of my Love I came,     I went into the orchard quietly;     And left the glow-worm, blessing it by name,                      15     Laid safely by itself, beneath a tree.","The whole next day I hoped, and hoped with fear;     At night the glow-worm shone beneath the tree;     I led my Lucy to the spot, “Look here,”     Oh!","joy it was for her, and joy for me!","20 “ALONG THE MAZES OF THIS SONG I GO” This, and the next two fragments, by Wordsworth, are extracted from his sister’s Grasmere Journal.--ED.","Along the mazes of this song I go     As inward motions of the wandering thought     Lead me, or outward circumstance impels.","Thus do I urge a never-ending way     Year after year, with many a sleep between,     Through joy and sorrow; if my lot be joy     More joyful if it be with sorrow sooth’d.","“THE RAINS AT LENGTH HAVE CEAS’D, THE WINDS ARE STILL’D”     The rains at length have ceas’d, the winds are still’d,     The stars shine brightly between clouds at rest,     And as a cavern is with darkness fill’d,     The vale is by a mighty sound possess’d “WITNESS THOU”                                 Witness thou     The dear companion of my lonely walk,     My hope, my joy, my sister, and my friend,     Or something dearer still, if reason knows     A dearer thought, or in the heart of love     There be a dearer name.",[356] [356] Compare Byron’s _Epistle to Augusta_--     My sister!,my sweet sister!,"if a name     Dearer and purer were, it should be thine.","It is a mere coincidence, as Byron could not have seen the Wordsworth MS.--ED.","WILD-FOWL                               The order’d troops     In spiral circles mount aloft, and soar     In prospect far above the denser air     That hangs o’er the moist plain.","Again they view     The glorious sun, and while the light of day     Still gleams upon their polish’d plumes--the bright     Sonorous squadrons sing their evening hymn.","WRITTEN IN A GROTTO Published in _The Morning Post_, March 9, 1802 I cannot affirm, with any certainty, that these lines were written by Wordsworth;

another--a description of the flight and movement of birds--was published in 1827, and subsequent editions, under the title of _Water-Fowl_; while the Bishop of Lincoln published other two passages in the _Memoirs_ of his uncle, beginning respectively--     On Nature’s invitation do I come, and     Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak.","Internal evidence (see the numerous allusions to Dorothy, and the reference to John Wordsworth) shows that this canto of _The Recluse_ was written at Grasmere, not long after Wordsworth’s arrival there, and certainly before his marriage.","The text, as now printed, has been carefully compared with the original MS. by Mr. Gordon Wordsworth.",The MS. heading is--THE RECLUSE.,"BOOK FIRST, PART FIRST.","HOME AT GRASMERE     Once to the verge of yon steep barrier came     A roving school-boy; what the Adventurer’s age     Hath now escaped his memory--but the hour,     One of a golden summer holiday,     He well remembers, though the year be gone.","5     Alone and devious from afar he came;     And, with a sudden influx overpowered     At sight of this seclusion, he forgot     His haste, for hasty had his footsteps been     As boyish his pursuits; and, sighing said,                        10     “What happy fortune were it here to live!","And, (if a thought of dying, if a thought     Of mortal separation, could intrude     With paradise before him), here to die!”     No prophet was he, had not even a hope,                           15     Scarcely a wish, but one bright pleasing thought,     A fancy in the heart of what might be     The lot of others, never could be his.","The station whence he looked was soft and green,     Not giddy yet aerial, with a depth                                20     Of vale below, a height of hills above.","For rest of body, perfect was the spot,     All that luxurious nature could desire,     But stirring to the spirit.",Who could gaze     And not feel motions there?,"He thought of clouds                  25     That sail on winds, of breezes that delight     To play on water, or in endless chase     Pursue each other through the yielding plain     Of grass or corn, over and through and through,     In billow after billow, evermore                                  30     Disporting.","Nor unmindful was the Boy     Of sunbeams, shadows, butterflies and birds,     Of fluttering Sylphs, and softly-gliding Fays,     Genii, and winged Angels that are Lords     Without restraint of all which they behold.","35     The illusion strengthening as he gazed, he felt     That such unfettered liberty was his,     Such power and joy; but only for this end,     To flit from field to rock, from rock to field,     From shore to island, and from isle to shore,                     40     From open ground to covert, from a bed     Of meadow-flowers into a tuft of wood,     From high to low, from low to high, yet still     Within the bound of this high concave; here     Must be his home, this Valley be his world.","45       Since that day forth the place to him--_to me_     (For I who live to register the truth     Was that same young and happy being) became     As beautiful to thought, as it had been,     When present, to the bodily sense; a haunt                        50     Of pure affections, shedding upon joy     A brighter joy; and through such damp and gloom     Of the gay mind, as ofttimes splenetic youth     Mistakes for sorrow darting beams of light     That no self-cherished sadness could withstand:                   55     And now ’tis mine, perchance for life, dear Vale,     Beloved Grasmere (let the Wandering Streams     Take up, the cloud-capped hills repeat, the Name),     One of thy lowly dwellings is my Home.",And was the cost so great?,"and could it seem                    60     An act of courage, and the thing itself     A conquest?",who must bear the blame?,"sage man     Thy prudence, thy experience--thy desires;     Thy apprehensions--blush thou for them all.","Yes, the realities of life so cold,                             65     So cowardly, so ready to betray,     So stinted in the measure of their grace     As we pronounce them, doing them much wrong,     Have been to me more bountiful than hope,     Less timid than desire--but that is passed.","70       On Nature’s invitation do I come,[359]     By reason sanctioned--Can the choice mislead,     That made the calmest, fairest spot of earth,     With all its unappropriated good,     My own; and not mine only, for with me                            75     Entrenched, say rather peacefully embowered,     Under yon orchard, in yon humble cot,     A younger orphan of a home extinct,     The only daughter of my parents, dwells.","Aye, think on that, my heart, and cease to stir,                80     Pause upon that, and let the breathing frame     No longer breathe, but all be satisfied.","--Oh if such silence be not thanks to God     For what hath been bestowed, then where, where then     Shall gratitude find rest?","Mine eyes did ne’er                    85     Fix on a lovely object, nor my mind     Take pleasure in the midst of happy thoughts,     But either She whom now I have, who now     Divides with me this loved abode, was there,     Or not far off.","Where’er my footsteps turned,                     90     Her Voice was like a hidden Bird that sang,     The thought of her was like a flash of light,     Or an _unseen_ companionship, a breath,     Or fragrance independent of the wind.","In all my goings, in the new and old                              95     Of all my meditations, and in this     Favourite of all, in this the most of all.","--What Being, therefore, since the birth of man     Had ever more abundant cause to speak     Thanks, and if favours of the heavenly Muse                      100     Make him more thankful, then to call on verse     To aid him, and in Song resound his joy.","The boon is absolute; surpassing grace     To me hath been vouchsafed; among the bowers     Of blissful Eden this was neither given,                         105     Nor could be given, possession of the good     Which had been sighed for, ancient thought fulfilled     And dear Imaginations realized     Up to their highest measure, yea and more.","Embrace me then, ye Hills, and close me in,                    110     Now in the clear and open day I feel     Your guardianship;

    Tempt the smooth water,[364] or the gleaming ice,     To show them a fair image; ’tis themselves,     Their own fair forms, upon the glimmering plain,                 225     Painted more soft and fair as they descend,     Almost to touch;--then up again aloft,     Up with a sally, and a flash of speed,     As if they scorned both resting-place and rest!","[365]     This day is a thanksgiving, ’tis a day                           230     Of glad emotion and deep quietness;     Not upon me alone hath been bestowed,     Me rich in many onward-looking thoughts,     The penetrating bliss; oh surely these     Have felt it, not the happy Quires of Spring,                    235     Her own peculiar family of love     That sport among green leaves, a blither train.","But two are missing--two, a lonely pair     Of milk-white Swans, wherefore are _they_ not seen     Partaking this day’s pleasure?","From afar                         240     They came, to sojourn here in solitude,     Choosing this Valley, they who had the choice     Of the whole world.","[366] We saw them day by day,     Through these two months of unrelenting storm,     Conspicuous at the centre of the Lake,                           245     Their safe retreat.","We knew them well, I guess     That the whole Valley knew them; but to us     They were more dear than may be well believed,     Not only for their beauty, and their still     And placid way of life, and constant love                        250     Inseparable, not for these alone,     But that _their_ state so much resembled ours,     They having also chosen this abode;     They strangers, and we strangers; they a pair,     And we a solitary pair like them.","255     They should not have departed; many days     Did I look forth in vain, nor on the wing     Could see them, nor in that small open space     Of blue unfrozen water, where they lodged,     And lived so long in quiet, side by side.","260     Shall we behold them, consecrated friends,     Faithful companions, yet another year     Surviving--they for us, and we for them--     And neither pair be broken?","Nay perchance     It is too late already for such hope,                            265     The Dalesmen may have aimed the deadly tube,     And parted them; or haply both are gone     One death, and that were mercy given to both.","Recal my song the ungenerous thought; forgive,     Thrice favoured Region, the conjecture harsh                     270     Of such inhospitable penalty,     Inflicted upon confidence so pure.","Ah, if I wished to follow where the sight     Of all that is before mine eyes, the voice     Which speaks from a presiding Spirit here,                       275     Would lead me, I should whisper to myself;     They who are dwellers in this holy place     Must needs themselves be hallowed, they require     No benediction from the stranger’s lips,     For they are blest already.","None would give                      280     The greeting “peace be with you” unto them,     For peace they have, it cannot but be theirs,     And mercy, and forbearance.","Nay--not these,     Their healing offices a pure goodwill     Precludes, and charity beyond the bounds                         285     Of charity--an overflowing love,     Not for the creature only, but for all     That is around them, love for every thing     Which in this happy region they behold!","Thus do we soothe ourselves, and when the thought              290     Is past we blame it not for having come.","What, if I floated down a pleasant Stream     And now am landed, and the motion gone,     Shall I reprove myself?","Ah no, the stream     Is flowing, and will never cease to flow,[367]                   295     And I shall float upon that stream again.","By such forgetfulness the soul becomes,     Words cannot say, how beautiful.","Then hail,     Hail to the visible Presence, hail to thee,     Delightful Valley, habitation fair!","300     And to whatever else of outward form     Can give us inward help, can purify,     And elevate, and harmonise, and soothe,     And steal away, and for a while deceive     And lap in pleasing rest, and bear us on                         305     Without desire in full complacency,     Contemplating perfection absolute     And entertained as in a placid sleep.","But not betrayed by tenderness of mind     That feared, or wholly overlooked the truth,                     310     Did we come hither, with romantic hope     To find, in midst of so much loveliness,     Love, perfect love; of so much majesty     A like majestic frame of mind in those     Who here abide, the persons like the place.","315     Not from such hope, or aught of such belief     Hath issued any portion of the joy     Which I have felt this day.","An awful voice,     ’Tis true, hath in my walks been often heard,     Sent from the mountains or the sheltered fields;                 320     Shout after shout--reiterated whoop     In manner of a bird that takes delight     In answering to itself; or like a hound     Single at chase among the lonely woods,     His yell repeating;[368] yet it was in truth                     325     A human voice--a Spirit of coming night,     How solemn when the sky is dark, and earth     Not dark, nor yet enlightened, but by snow     Made visible, amid a noise of winds     And bleatings manifold of mountain sheep,                        330     Which in that iteration recognise     Their summons, and are gathering round for food,     Devoured with keenness ere to grove or bank     Or rocky _bield_ with patience they retire.","That very voice, which, in some timid mood                     335     Of superstitious fancy, might have seemed     Awful as ever stray Demoniac uttered,     His steps to govern in the Wilderness;     Or as the Norman Curfew’s regular beat,     To hearths when first they darkened at the knell:                340     That Shepherd’s voice, it may have reached mine ear     Debased and under profanation, made     The ready Organ of articulate sounds     From ribaldry, impiety, or wrath     Issuing when shame hath ceased to check the brawls               345     Of some abused Festivity--so be it.","I came not dreaming of unruffled life,     Untainted manners; born among the hills,     Bred also there, I wanted not a scale     To regulate my hopes.","Pleased with the good,                     350     I shrink not from the evil with disgust,     Or with immoderate pain.","I look for Man,     The common creature of the brotherhood,     Differing but little from the Man elsewhere,     For selfishness, and envy, and revenge,                          355     Ill neighbourhood--pity that this should be--     Flattery and double-dealing, strife and wrong.","Yet is it something gained, it is in truth     A mighty gain, that Labour here preserves     His rosy face, a servant only here                               360     Of the fire-side, or of the open field,     A freeman, therefore, sound and unimpaired;     That extreme penury is here unknown,     And cold and hunger’s abject wretchedness,     Mortal to body, and the heaven-born mind;                        365     That they who want, are not too great a weight     For those who can relieve.","Here may the heart     Breathe in the air of fellow-suffering     Dreadless, as in a kind of fresher breeze     Of her own native element, the hand                              370     Be ready and unwearied without plea     From tasks too frequent, or beyond its power     For languor, or indifference, or despair.","And as these lofty barriers break the force     Of winds, this deep Vale,--as it doth in part                    375     Conceal us from the storm,--so here abides     A power and a protection for the mind,     Dispensed indeed to other solitudes,     Favoured by noble privilege like this,     Where kindred independence of estate                             380     Is prevalent, where he who tills the field,     He, happy man!","is master of the field,[369]     And treads the mountains which his fathers trod.","Not less than half-way up yon Mountain’s side     Behold a dusky spot, a grove of Firs,                            385     That seems still smaller than it is.",This grove     Is haunted--by what ghost?,"a gentle spirit     Of memory faithful to the call of love;

the silent mind     Has her own treasures, and I think of these,                     425     Love what I see, and honour humankind.","No, we are not alone, we do not stand,     My Sister, here misplaced and desolate,     Loving what no one cares for but ourselves;     We shall not scatter through the plains and rocks                430     Of this fair Vale, and o’er its spacious heights     Unprofitable kindliness, bestowed     On objects unaccustomed to the gifts     Of feeling, which were cheerless and forlorn     But few weeks past, and would be so again                        435     Were we not here; we do not tend a lamp     Whose lustre we alone participate,     Which shines dependent upon us alone,     Mortal though bright, a dying, dying flame.","Look where we will, some human hand has been                     440     Before us with its offering; not a tree     Sprinkles these little pastures but the same     Hath furnished matter for a thought; perchance,     For some one, serves as a familiar friend.","Joy spreads, and sorrow spreads; and this whole Vale,            445     Home of untutored shepherds as it is,     Swarms with sensation, as with gleams of sunshine,     Shadows or breezes, scents or sounds.","Nor deem     These feelings, though subservient more than ours     To every day’s demand for daily bread,                           450     And borrowing more their spirit, and their shape     From self-respecting interests, deem them not     Unworthy therefore, and unhallowed: no,     They lift the animal being, do themselves     By Nature’s kind and ever-present aid                            455     Refine the selfishness from which they spring,     Redeem by love the individual sense     Of anxiousness with which they are combined.","And thus it is that fitly they become     Associates in the joy of purest minds,                           460     They blend therewith congenially: meanwhile,     Calmly they breathe their own undying life     Through this their mountain sanctuary.","Long,     Oh long may it remain inviolate,     Diffusing health and sober cheerfulness,                         465     And giving to the moments as they pass     Their little boons of animating thought     That sweeten labour, make it seen and felt     To be no arbitrary weight imposed,     But a glad function natural to man.","470       Fair proof of this, newcomer though I be,     Already have I gained.","The inward frame     Though slowly opening, opens every day     With process not unlike to that which cheers     A pensive stranger, journeying at his leisure                    475     Through some Helvetian dell, when low-hung mists     Break up, and are beginning to recede;     How pleased he is where thin and thinner grows     The veil, or where it parts at once, to spy     The dark pines thrusting forth their spiky heads;                480     To watch the spreading lawns with cattle grazed,     Then to be greeted by the scattered huts,     As they shine out; and _see_ the streams whose murmur     Had soothed his ear while _they_ were hidden: how pleased     To have about him, which way e’er he goes,                       485     Something on every side concealed from view,     In every quarter something visible,     Half-seen or wholly, lost and found again,     Alternate progress and impediment,     And yet a growing prospect in the main.","490       Such pleasure now is mine, albeit forced,     Herein less happy than the Traveller     To cast from time to time a painful look     Upon unwelcome things, which unawares     Reveal themselves; not therefore is my heart                     495     Depressed, nor does it fear what is to come,     But confident, enriched at every glance.","The more I see the more delight my mind     Receives, or by reflexion can create.","Truth justifies herself, and as she dwells                       500     With Hope, who would not follow where she leads?","Nor let me pass unheeded other loves     Where no fear is, and humbler sympathies.","Already hath sprung up within my heart     A liking for the small grey horse that bears                     505     The paralytic man, and for the brute--     In Scripture sanctified--the patient brute,     On which the cripple, in the quarry maimed,     Rides to and fro: I know them and their ways.","[370]     The famous sheep-dog, first in all the Vale,                     510     Though yet to me a stranger, will not be     A stranger long;

    The calm of night is powerless to remove     These cares, and thus she speaks to wingèd Love:                  10       “O son, my strength, my power!","who dost despise     (What, save thyself, none dares through earth and skies)     The giant-quelling bolts of Jove, I flee,     O son, a suppliant to thy deity!","What perils meet Æneas in his course,                             15     How Juno’s hate with unrelenting force     Pursues thy brother--this to thee is known;     And oft-times hast thou made my griefs thine own.",Him now the generous Dido by soft chains     Of bland entreaty at her court detains;                           20     Junonian hospitalities prepare     Such apt occasion that I dread a snare.,"Hence, ere some hostile God can intervene,     Would I, by previous wiles, inflame the queen     With passion for Æneas, such strong love                          25     That at my beck, mine only, she shall move.","Hear, and assist;--the father’s mandate calls     His young Ascanius to the Tyrian walls;     He comes, my dear delight,--and costliest things     Preserv’d from fire and flood for presents brings.","30     Him will I take, and in close covert keep,     ’Mid groves Idalian, lull’d to gentle sleep,     Or on Cythera’s far-sequestered steep,     That he may neither know what hope is mine,     Nor by his presence traverse the design.","35     Do thou, but for a single night’s brief space,     Dissemble; be that boy in form and face!","And when enraptured Dido shall receive     Thee to her arms, and kisses interweave     With many a fond embrace, while joy runs high,                    40     And goblets crown the proud festivity,     Instil thy subtle poison, and inspire,     At every touch, an unsuspected fire.”       Love, at the word, before his mother’s sight     Puts off his wings, and walks, with proud delight,                45     Like young Iulus; but the gentlest dews     Of slumber Venus sheds, to circumfuse     The true Ascanius steep’d in placid rest;     Then wafts him, cherish’d on her careful breast,     Through upper air to an Idalian glade,                            50     Where he on soft _amaracas_ is laid,     With breathing flowers embraced, and fragrant shade.","But Cupid, following cheerily his guide     Achates, with the gifts to Carthage hied;     And, as the hall he entered, there, between                       55     The sharers of her golden couch, was seen     Reclin’d in festal pomp the Tyrian queen.","The Trojans, too (Æneas at their head),     On couches lie, with purple overspread:     Meantime in canisters is heap’d the bread,                        60     Pellucid water for the hands is borne,     And napkins of smooth texture, finely shorn.","Within are fifty handmaids, who prepare,     As they in order stand, the dainty fare;     And fume the household deities with store                         65     Of odorous incense; while a hundred more     Match’d with an equal number of like age,     But each of manly sex, a docile page,     Marshal the banquet, giving with due grace     To cup or viand its appointed place.","70     The Tyrians rushing in, an eager band,     Their painted couches seek, obedient to command.","They look with wonder on the gifts--they gaze     Upon Iulus, dazzled with the rays     That from his ardent countenance are flung,                       75     And charm’d to hear his simulating tongue;     Nor pass unprais’d the robe and veil divine,     Round which the yellow flowers and wandering foliage twine.","But chiefly Dido, to the coming ill     Devoted, strives in vain her vast desires to fill;                80     She views the gifts; upon the child then turns     Insatiable looks, and gazing burns.","To ease a father’s cheated love he hung     Upon Æneas, and around him clung;     Then seeks the queen; with her his arts he tries;                 85     She fastens on the boy enamour’d eyes,     Clasps in her arms, nor weens (O lot unblest!)","How great a God, incumbent o’er her breast,     Would fill it with his spirit.","He, to please     His Acidalian mother, by degrees                                  90     Blots out Sichaeus, studious to remove     The dead, by influx of a living love,     By stealthy entrance of a perilous guest.",Troubling a heart that had been long at rest.,"Now when the viands were withdrawn, and ceas’d                  95     The first division of the splendid feast,     While round a vacant board the chiefs recline,     Huge goblets are brought forth; they crown the wine;     Voices of gladness roll the walls around;     Those gladsome voices from the courts rebound;                   100     From gilded rafters many a blazing light     Depends, and torches overcome the night.","The minutes fly--till, at the queen’s command,     A bowl of state is offered to her hand:     Then she, as Belus wont, and all the line                        105     From Belus, filled it to the brim with wine;     Silence ensued.","“O Jupiter, whose care     Is hospitable dealing, grant my prayer!","Productive day be this of lasting joy     To Tyrians, and these exiles driven from Troy;                   110     A day to future generations dear!","Let Bacchus, donor of soul-quick’ning cheer,     Be present;

    He rais’d the bowl, and took a long deep draught;     Then every chief in turn the beverage quaff’d.","120       Graced with redundant hair, Iopas sings     The lore of Atlas, to resounding strings,     The labours of the Sun, the lunar wanderings;     Whence human kind, and brute; what natural powers     Engender lightning, whence are falling showers.","125     He haunts Arcturus,--that fraternal twain     The glittering Bears,--the Pleiads fraught with rain;     --Why suns in winter, shunning heaven’s steep heights     Post seaward,--what impedes the tardy nights.","The learned song from Tyrian hearers draws                       130     Loud shouts,--the Trojans echo the applause.","--But, lengthening out the night with converse new,     Large draughts of love unhappy Dido drew;     Of Priam ask’d, of Hector--o’er and o’er--     What arms the son of bright Aurora wore;--                       135     What steeds the car of Diomed could boast;     Among the leaders of the Grecian host     How look’d Achilles, their dread paramount--     “But nay--the fatal wiles, O guest, recount,     Retrace the Grecian cunning from its source,                     140     Your own grief and your friends’--your wandering course;

    That jocund April morn lives there,     Its cheering sounds, its hues so fair.","Why mixes with remembrance blithe     What nothing but the restless scythe                              30     Of Death can utterly destroy,     A heaviness, a dull alloy?",Ah Friend!,thy heart can answer why.,"Even then I heaved a bitter sigh,     No word of sorrow did’st thou speak,                              35     But tears stole down thy tremulous cheek.","The wished for hour at length was come,     And thou had’st housed me in thy home,     On fair Gwerndwffnant’s billowy hill,     Had’st led me to its crystal rill,                                40     And led me through the dingle deep     Up to the highest grassy steep,     The sheep walk where the snow-white lambs     Sported beside their quiet dams.","But thou wert destined to remove                                  45     From all these objects of thy love,     In this thy later day to roam     Far off, and seek another home.","_Now_ thou art gone--belike ’tis best--     And I remain a passing guest,                                     50     Yet for thy sake, beloved Friend,     When from this spot my way shall tend,     And if my timid soul might dare     To shape the future in its prayer,     Then fervently would I entreat                                    55     Our gracious God to guide thy feet     Back to the peaceful sunny cot,     Where thou so oft hast blessed thy lot.","[395] I owe my knowledge of this and the following poem to the nephew of Mrs. Wordsworth, the Reverend Thomas Hutchinson of Kimbolton, Herefordshire, who wrote: “The two following poems were found among his papers on the demise of Mr. Monkhouse--a first cousin of Wordsworth;

                            85     Then did they feel a languor spread     Over their limbs, the beating tread     Was stilled--the busy throbbing heart--         And silently we all depart.","The shelter of our rustic cot                                     90     Receives us, and we envy not     The palace, or the stately dome;     But wish that _all_ had such a home.","Each child repeats his nightly prayer     That God may bless their parents’ care                            95     To guide them in the way of truth     Through helpless childhood, giddy youth.",The closing hymn of cheerful praise     Doth yet again their spirits raise;     But ’tis not now a thoughtless joy.,"100     For tender parents, loving friends,     And all the gifts God’s blessing sends,     Feelingly do they bless his name.","That homage paid, the young retire     With no unsatisfied desire;                                      105     Theirs is one long, one steady sleep,     Till the sun, tip-toe on the steep     In front of our beloved cot,     Casts on the walls her brightest beams.","Within, a startling lustre streams.","110     They all awaken suddenly;     As at the touch of magic skill,     Or, as the pilgrim, at the bell         That summons him to matin-prayer.",And is it sorrow that they feel?,115     Nay!,"call it not by such a name,     The stroke of sadness that doth steal     With rapid motion through their hearts,     When comes the thought that yesterday     With all its joys is passed away,                                120         The long expected happy day.",An instant--and all sadness goes;     Nor brighter looks the half-blown rose     Than does the countenance of each child     Whether of ardent soul or mild.,"125     The hour was fixed--they are prepared--     And homeward now they must depart,     And after many a brisk adieu,     On pony trim, and fleet of limb,     Their bustling journey they pursue.","130     The fair-hair’d gentle quiet maid,     And she who is of daring mood,     The valiant and the timid Boy     Alike are ranged to hardihood;     And wheresoe’er the troop appear                                 135     They scatter smiles, a hearty cheer     Comes from both old and young,     And blessings fall from many a tongue.","They reach the dear paternal roof,     Nor dread a cold or stern reproof,                               140     While they pour forth the history     Of three days’ mirth and revelry.",Ah!,"Children, happy is your lot,     Still bound together in one knot     Beneath your tender mother’s eye!","145     Too soon these blessed days shall fly,     And brothers shall from sisters part;     And, trust me, whatsoe’er your doom,     Whate’er betide through years to come,     The punctual pleasures of your home                              150     Shall linger in your thoughts,     More clear than any future hope     Though fancy take her freest scope.",For oh!,too soon your hearts shall own     The past is all that is your own.,"155     And every day of _festival_     Gratefully shall ye then recal,     Less for their own sakes than for this,     That each shall be a resting-place     For memory, and divide the race                                  160     Of childhood’s smooth and happy years,     Thus lengthening out that term of life     Which governed by your parents’ care     Is free from sorrow and from strife.",COMPOSED WHEN A PROBABILITY EXISTED OF OUR BEING OBLIGED TO QUIT RYDAL MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE The following lines were written by Wordsworth in 1826.,He never published them.,"They were the result of a slight disagreement between the Wordsworth family and the Le Flemings, which led the former to fear that they might have to “quit Rydal Mount as a residence.” It was an insignificant difference, and the Wordsworths did not leave their home.","The only thing worthy of record, in connection with the matter, is that the fear of being dispossessed led the poet to write what follows.--ED.","The doubt to which a wavering hope had clung     Is fled; we must depart, willing or not;     Sky-piercing Hills!","must bid farewell to you     And all that ye look down upon with pride,     With tenderness, embosom; to your paths,                           5     And pleasant dwellings, to familiar trees     And wild-flowers known as well as if our hands     Had tended them: and O pellucid Spring!","Unheard of, save in one small hamlet, here     Not undistinguished, for of wells that ooze                       10     Or founts that gurgle from yon craggy steep,     Their common sire, thou only bear’st his name.","Insensibly the foretaste of this parting     Hath ruled my steps, and seals me to thy side,     Mindful that thou (ah!","wherefore by my Muse                       15     So long unthanked) hast cheered a simple board     With beverage pure as ever fixed the choice     Of hermit, dubious where to scoop his cell;     Which Persian kings might envy; and thy meek     And gentle aspect oft has ministered                              20     To finer uses.","They for me must cease;     Days will pass on, the year, if years be given,     Fade,--and the moralising mind derive     No lessons from the presence of a Power     By the inconstant nature we inherit                               25     Unmatched in delicate beneficence;     For neither unremitting rains avail     To swell thee into voice; nor longest drought     Thy bounty stints, nor can thy beauty mar,     Beauty not therefore wanting change to stir                       30     The fancy pleased by spectacles unlooked for.","Nor yet, perchance, translucent Spring, had tolled     The Norman curfew bell when human hands     First offered help that the deficient rock     Might overarch thee, from pernicious heat                         35     Defended, and appropriate to man’s need.","Such ties will not be severed: but, when we     Are gone, what summer loiterer will regard,     Inquisitive, thy countenance, will peruse,     Pleased to detect the dimpling stir of life,                      40     The breathing faculty with which thou yield’st     (Tho’ a mere goblet to the careless eye)     Boons inexhaustible?","Who, hurrying on     With a step quickened by November’s cold,     Shall pause, the skill admiring that can work                     45     Upon thy chance-defilements--withered twigs     That, lodged within thy crystal depths, seem bright,     As if they from a silver tree had fallen--     And oaken leaves that, driven by whirling blasts,     Sunk down, and lay immersed in dead repose                        50     For Time’s invisible tooth to prey upon     Unsightly objects and uncoveted,     Till thou with crystal bead-drops didst encrust     Their skeletons, turned to brilliant ornaments.","But, from thy bosom, should some venturous[396] hand              55     Abstract those gleaming relics, and uplift them,     However gently, toward the vulgar air,     At once their tender brightness disappears,     Leaving the intermeddler to upbraid     His folly.","Thus (I feel it while I speak),                        60     Thus, with the fibres of these thoughts it fares;     And oh!","how much, of all that love creates     Or beautifies, like changes undergo,     Suffers like loss when drawn out of the soul,     Its silent laboratory!","Words should say                           65     (Could they depict the marvels of thy cell)     How often I have marked a plumy fern     From the live rock with grace inimitable     Bending its apex toward a paler self     Reflected all in perfect lineaments--                             70     Shadow and substance kissing point to point     In mutual stillness; or, if some faint breeze     Entering the cell gave restlessness to one,     The other, glassed in thy unruffled breast,     Partook of every motion, met, retired,                            75     And met again.","Such playful sympathy,     Such delicate caress as in the shape     Of this green plant had aptly recompensed     For baffled lips and disappointed arms     And hopeless pangs, the spirit of that youth,                     80     The fair Narcissus by some pitying God     Changed to a crimson flower; when he, whose pride     Provoked a retribution too severe,     Had pined; upon his watery duplicate     Wasting that love the nymphs implored in vain.","85       Thus while my Fancy wanders, thou, clear Spring,     Moved (shall I say?)","like a dear friend who meets     A parting moment with her loveliest look,     And seemingly her happiest, look so fair     It frustrates its own purpose, and recalls                        90     The grieved one whom it meant to send away--     Dost tempt me by disclosures exquisite     To linger, bending over thee: for now,     What witchcraft, mild enchantress, may with thee     Compare!","thy earthly bed a moment past                            95     Palpable to sight as the dry ground,     Eludes perception, not by rippling air     Concealed, nor through effect of some impure     Upstirring; but, abstracted by a charm     Of my own cunning, earth mysteriously                            100     From under thee hath vanished, and slant beams     The silent inquest of a western sun,     Assisting, lucid well-spring!","Thou revealest     Communion without check of herbs and flowers,     And the vault’s hoary sides to which they cling,                 105     Imaged in downward show; the flower, the Herbs,[397]     _These_ not of earthly texture, and the vault     Not _there_ diminutive, but through a scale     Of vision less and less distinct, descending     To gloom imperishable.","So (if truths                             110     The highest condescend to be set forth     By processes minute), even so--when thought     Wins help from something greater than herself--     Is the firm basis of habitual sense     Supplanted, not for treacherous vacancy                          115     And blank dissociation from a world     We love, but that the residues of flesh,     Mirrored, yet not too strictly, may refine     To Spirit;

but it is doubtful whether it was written by him, or not.",Possibly Mr. Quillinan wrote it.,"The place, and the date of composition--given in MS.--are, “Ambleside, 22nd February, 1849.” Miss Sellon was a relation of the late Count Cavour.--ED.","The vestal priestess of a sisterhood who knows     No self, and whom the selfish scorn--     She seeks a wilderness of weed and thorn,     And, undiverted from the blessed mood     By keen reproach or blind ingratitude,                             5     A wreath she twines of blossoms lowly born--     An amaranthine crown of flowers forlorn--     And hangs her garland on the Holy Rood.","Sister of Mercy, bravely hast thou won     From men who winnow charity from Faith                            10     The Pharasaic sneer that treats as dross     The works by faith ordained.","Pursue thy path,     Till, at the last, thou hear the voice--“Well done,     Thou good and faithful servant of the Cross.” “THE WORSHIP OF THIS SABBATH MORN” BY DOROTHY WORDSWORTH These lines were published in _The Monthly Packet_, in July 1891, where the following note is appended by Miss Christabel Coleridge:--“Written _circa_ 1852-3, and given to Mrs. Derwent Coleridge.” But Miss Edith Coleridge, and Mr. E. H. Coleridge, tell me that they think they “belong to an earlier period.” Mr. Coleridge writes, “I have heard Miss Wordsworth repeat the lines now printed, seated in her arm-chair, on the terrace at Rydal Mount.”--ED.","The worship of this Sabbath morn,     How sweetly it begins!",With the full choral hymn of birds     Mingles no sad lament for sins.,Alas!,"my feet no more may join                                     5     The cheerful Sabbath train;     But if I inwardly lament,     Oh!",may a will subdued all grief restrain.,"No prisoner am I on this couch,     My mind is free to roam,                                          10     And leisure, peace, and loving friends,     Are the best treasures of an earthly home.","Such gifts are mine, then why deplore     The body’s slow decay?",A warning mercifully sent                                         15     To fix my hopes upon a surer stay.,"A WORDSWORTH BIBLIOGRAPHY I.--_GREAT BRITAIN_ I EDITIONS PUBLISHED DURING WORDSWORTH’S LIFETIME In the Bibliographies by Mr. Tutin and Professor Dowden there are numerous and valuable details as to these editions, which it is unnecessary to reproduce here.--ED.",1 1793.,AN EVENING WALK.,An Epistle; in verse.,"Addressed to a Young Lady, from the Lakes of the North of England.","By W.

ST. JOHN, Ithaca, New York.",PREFATORY NOTE My ideal in attempting to prepare a _Bibliography of Wordsworth in America_ was high.,"I hoped to see each edition, or at least to identify the editions hinted at in the various catalogues.","I determined to read every article, in criticism, or review; and to know if the many references, given by Poole and other authorities, were correct.","As is usually the case, the reality has fallen far short of the ideal.","But, while the results are not what were desired, there have been many fortunate discoveries.",Two things were learned to begin with.,"First, that astonishingly little care had been taken to preserve the history of the early American Editions, or to preserve, even, the earlier American Periodicals.",Most of our larger libraries are amazingly deficient in these works.,"Second, it was found that existing Catalogues or Lists are not only far from complete, but full of gross blunders.","Roorbach (the Addenda, Supplements, etc.)","was found to be a mere rehash of the old trade sales Catalogues, swarming with blunders.","In the matter of dates, imprints, the particular editions, the size of books, Roorbach is utterly untrustworthy.",Allibone (so far as Wordsworth is concerned) is also confusing and incomplete.,I did not find much in the various Public or College Library Catalogues.,"I wrote to the librarians of some of the older libraries, after I had made out a preliminary list, to ascertain if they could add thereto any editions, from their cards or manuscript catalogues.",From these sources I was enabled several times to solve seemingly insolvable problems.,"I had assistance from, and in some instances visited, the following libraries: Cornell University, Boston Public Library, Boston Athenæum, Harvard College, Philadelphia Public Library, the Library College of Philadelphia, Mercantile Library College, Philadelphia; the Public Library, St. Louis; that of Lennox and Astor, the University of Virginia, the State Library, Richmond, Va., and one or two other Southern libraries.","I have written more than one hundred letters to publishers, editors, authors, the descendants of early American Wordsworthians, Professors of Literature, and professed Wordsworthians in Seminaries and Colleges.","I have examined, or employed others to examine, the following works for editions of Wordsworth: the _New York Literary World_, _Norton’s Literary Gazette_, _American Publishers’ Circular_, _Publishers’ Weekly_, _Catalogues of Congress Library_, _The Port Folio_, _American Quarterly Review_, _Knickerbocker Magazine_, _New York Quarterly Review_, _American Review_, _North American Review_.",And this is but half of my story.,"Poole’s “Index,” of course, was a great assistance.","But I did not rely altogether on him, after I had discovered several mistakes in titles and numbering--mistakes which were confusing in the extreme.","I have consulted all other Indexes and Reference Lists that I could procure, and have carefully examined the periodicals in which it was possible that such articles could be found.","My greatest light, however, came from responses to personal appeals, to those in the North, South, East, and West of the Country, who enlightened me in particular directions.","I needed assistance, not only to discover the articles, but more particularly to secure the articles to read, or to procure proper persons to read the few articles that I could not obtain.","When valuable books were sent me, by express, from distant College Libraries, that I might read for myself, I realised the bond there is between Wordsworthians.","I cannot begin to speak of the delight that I have had in this work, delight because of the response I have met with, and in opening up unknown and rich veins of criticism.","I have learned too, that Wordsworth has many enthusiastic followers in America.","I have included in the Bibliography the accounts of visits paid to Wordsworth by certain well-known Americans, a half-dozen poems on Wordsworth, and three or four unpublished Lectures.","I am exceedingly grateful to the many who (to my surprise) have answered my questions, and have given me of their valuable time.","I am especially indebted to Mr. George P. Philes, of Philadelphia, and also to Mr. F. Saunders of the Astor Library, New York.","Dean Murray of Princeton rendered me exceedingly gracious service, and but for Mr. Edwin H. Woodruff of Stanford University, California, I should not have known how or where to begin my investigations.",In all probability my work is not perfect.,I would that it were.,"I only know that I have been enabled, by enthusiasm alone, to lay a foundation for Wordsworth Bibliography in America, that may be an assistance to future scholars, and will aid the next Wordsworthian who is brave enough to build enduringly.",C. M. ST. JOHN.,"I AMERICAN EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH I have endeavoured to include in this list every distinctive American edition of Wordsworth, published during the poet’s lifetime, and since his death.","There are many others, issued with the imprints of honourable publishers; which, upon investigation, were found to be English reprints; to say nothing of those editions made from worn-out plates, and issued by houses of less reputation for honourableness.","I was puzzled to account for so many editions of Matthew Arnold’s Selections, some of them bearing the imprint of Harper Brothers, some of Macmillan, and several of Crowell.","The Harpers wrote me that these various publications were possible in view of the fact that there was no copyright of the work, and that all of them might properly be called American Editions.","I have not placed those bearing the Macmillan imprint, of course, among purely American editions.",Nor have I included the several cheap ones of Crowell.,"The one of Crowell, given in the list, is copyrighted by the Crowell Company.","The fact that the introduction of Wordsworth’s poetry into America is so easily authenticated, and that the history of it is so concise, is my apology for deviating from ordinary bibliographical rule in including among the regular editions certain numbers of America’s first Literary Journal, and two or three other volumes.","I have confined myself to a simple chronological arrangement of the Editions, with place of imprint, name of publisher, number, and size of volumes.","This makes the most convenient list for easy reference, especially as I have tried to mention technical points of difference.",C.

A note in “The Port Folio” (vol.","i. p. 24) is as follows: “The public may remember reading in some of the newspapers the interesting little ballads, _We are Seven_, and _Goody Blake and Harry Gill_.","They were extracted from the ‘Lyrical Ballads,’ a collection remarkable for originality, simplicity, and nature.… The following, _Simon Lee_, is from the same work.” It is evident from this that two, at least, of Wordsworth’s poems were copied into American newspapers as early as 1800, and that Joseph Dennie, the founder, as well as editor, of “The Port Folio”--the first purely Literary Journal established in this country--was the first American champion of Wordsworth.",C. M. ST. JOHN.,[479] _The Pet Lamb_ appeared in this Book almost immediately after its publication in England.,It was the first poem of Wordsworth’s published in a book in America.,It was also the first instance of the introduction of a poem of Wordsworth’s into a School Book.,C. M. ST. JOHN.,"[480] The first American edition, and the first work by Wordsworth, printed in America.","It looks as if the Poet found appreciative readers in America sooner than in England; the first edition of “Lyrical Ballads,” which had fallen dead in his own country in 1798, being published in Philadelphia in 1802.","The American edition was delayed in the press, in order to include certain pieces which first appeared in the second (English) edition of 1802.",See Humphreys’ Preface.,"A copy of “Lyrical Ballads,” 1802, is in the possession of Judge Henry Reed, with exactly the same title-page as the above, except that it reads-- “Printed by James Humphreys for Joseph Groff.” It is believed that the work was printed at the joint expense of Humphreys and Groff, each bookseller taking a certain number of copies upon which was placed his individual imprint.",Both book-sellers advertised the volumes almost simultaneously.,"I know of another copy of (1802) “Lyrical Ballads,” of which the first volume contains the imprint of Humphreys, and the second volume that of Groff.","The two volumes are bound together, and are _identical_ in type, paper, etc.",C. M. ST. JOHN.,"[481] Amongst the contents there are four long extracts from _The Excursion_, with titles attributed to W.W. _Goody Blake and Harry Gill_ is amongst the extracts from “Lyrical Ballads,” and there is a long note to the former poem by Joseph Dennie.",C. M. ST. JOHN.,[482] The first collected edition of Wordsworth’s Poems printed in America.,C. M. ST. JOHN.,[483] The sketch is by R. H. Home.,"The poems are _The Last of the Flock_, _The Dungeon_, _The Mad Mother_, _Anecdote for Fathers_, _We are Seven_, _Lines Written in Early Spring_, _The Female Vagrant_, _Goody Blake and Harry Gill_, _The Waterfall and the Eglantine_, _The Oak and the Broom_, _Lucy Gray_, _Hart-Leap Well_, _Lucy_, _Nutling_, _Ruth_.",C.

JOHN.,[487] In an editorial of April 16 of “The New World” is the following: “We are enabled by the purchase of the printed sheets considerably in advance of their publication in England to present the first and only American Editions of new poems by William Wordsworth.” C. M. ST. JOHN.,[488] This is spoken of in Ellis Yarnall’s Reminiscences as having no date.,"When John Locken--the first publisher--failed, the plates passed into the possession of Messrs. Uriah Hunt and Son.","They retired from business, and Messrs. Leavitt and Co. took the plates.",It is possible that there was an edition earlier than 1843.,C. M. ST. JOHN.,"[489] The last two named are exactly as in 1843, except that they are printed on larger paper.",Why one is put down 32mo and the other 24mo is a mystery!,C. M. ST.

ST. JOHN.,[491] Copyright in 1848.,It contains about one-fifth of all Wordsworth’s poems.,"The Essay, which occupies ten pages, is taken “by permission” from Tuckerman’s _Thoughts on Poets_.",C. M. ST. JOHN.,"[492] In connection with this edition, I can vouch for the five firms of Publishers in Philadelphia, but I cannot explain it.",C. M. ST.
