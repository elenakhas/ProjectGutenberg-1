carve for us the grace That caught Anne Hathaway in Shottery-side, The hand that clasped Southampton's in the days Ere that dark dame, of passion and of pride Burned in his heart the brand of her disdain, The eyes that wept when little Hamnet died, The lips that learned from Marlowe's and again Taught riper lore to Fletcher and the rest, The presence and demeanor sovereign At last at Stratford calm and manifest, That rested on the seventh day and scanned His work and knew it good, and left the quest And like his own enchanter broke his wand.",No viewless mind!,"The very shape, no less, He used to speak and smile with, move and stand!","God is most God not in his loneliness, Unfellowed, discreationed, unrevealed, Nor thundering on Sinai, pitiless, Nor when the seven vials are unsealed, But when his spirit companions with our thought And in his fellowship our pain is healed;

So I, thy lover, keep thee in my heart; So may this figure set for men to see Where the world passes eager for the mart, Be as a sudden insight of the soul That makes a darkness into order start, And lift thee up for all men, fair and whole, Till scholar, merchant farmer, artisan, Seeing, divine beneath the aureole The fellow heart and know thee for a man.",AT THE ROAD-HOUSE: IN MEMORY OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.,"You hearken, fellows?",Turned aside Into the road-house of the past!,The prince of vagabonds is gone To house among his peers at last.,"The stainless gallant gentleman, So glad of life, he gave no trace, No hint he even once beheld The spectre peering in his face; But gay and modest held the road, Nor feared the Shadow of the Dust; And saw the whole world rich with joy, As every valiant farer must.","I think that old and vasty inn Will have a welcome guest to-night, When Chaucer, breaking off some tale That fills his hearers with delight, Shall lift up his demure brown eyes To bid the stranger in; and all Will turn to greet the one on whom The crystal lot was last to fall.","Keats of the more than mortal tongue Will take grave Milton by the sleeve To meet their kin, whose woven words Had elvish music in the weave.","Dear Lamb and excellent Montaigne, Sterne and the credible Defoe, Borrow, DeQuincey, the great Dean, The sturdy leisurist Thoreau; The furtive soul whose dark romance, By ghostly door and haunted stair, Explored the dusty human heart And the forgotten garrets there; The moralist it could not spoil, To hold an empire in his hands; Sir Walter, and the brood who sprang From Homer through a hundred lands, Singers of songs on all men's lips, Tellers of tales in all men's ears, Movers of hearts that still must beat To sorrows feigned and fabled tears; Horace and Omar, doubting still What mystery lurks beyond the seen, Yet blithe and reassured before That fine unvexed Virgilian mien; These will companion him to-night, Beyond this iron wintry gloom, When Shakespeare and Cervantes bid The great joy-masters give him room.","No alien there in speech or mood, He will pass in, one traveller more; And portly Ben will smile to see The velvet jacket at the door.",VERLAINE.,"Avid of life and love, insatiate vagabond, With quest too furious for the graal he would have won, He flung himself at the eternal sky, as one Wrenching his chains but impotent to burst the bond.","Yet under the revolt, the revel, the despond, What pools of innocence, what crystal benison!","As through a riven mist that glowers in the sun, A stretch of God's blue calm glassed in a virgin pond.","Prowler of obscene streets that riot reek along, And aisles with incense numb and gardens mad with rose, Monastic cells and dreams of dim brocaded lawns, Death, which has set the calm of Time upon his song, Surely upon his soul has kissed the same repose In some fair heaven the Christ has set apart for Fauns.",DISTILLATION.,"They that eat the uncrushed grape Walk with steady heels: Lo, now, how they stare and gape Where the poet reels!",He has drunk the sheer divine Concentration of the vine.,A FRIEND'S WISH.,"To C.

down Into the zones of sun!",LAL OF KILRUDDEN.,"Kilrudden ford, Kilrudden dale, Kilrudden fronting every gale On the lorn coast of Inishfree, And Lal's last bed the plunging sea.","Lal of Kilrudden with flame-red hair, And the sea-blue eyes that rove and dare, And the open heart with never a care; With her strong brown arms and her ankles bare, God in heaven, but she was fair, That night the storm put in from sea?","The nightingales of Inishkill, The rose that climbed her window-sill, The shade that rustled or was still, The wind that roved and had his will, And one white sail on the low sea-hill, Were all she knew of love.","So when the storm drove in that day, And her lover's ship on the ledges lay, Past help and wrecking in the gray, And the cry was, ""Who'll go down the bay, With half of the lifeboat's crew away?""","Who should push to the front and say, ""I will be one, be others who may,"" But Lal of Kilrudden, born at sea!","The nightingales all night in the rain, The rose that fell at her window-pane, The frost that blackened the purple plain, And the scorn of pitiless disdain At the hands of the wolfish pirate main, Quelling her great hot heart in vain, Were all she knew of death.","Kilrudden ford, Kilrudden dale, Kilrudden ruined in the gale That wrecked the coast of Inishfree, And Lal's last bed the plunging sea.","HUNTING-SONG: FROM ""KING ARTHUR.""","Oh, who
