majority in silence, though now and then suppressed, indistinct talking may be heard.","Starting from somewhere far off to the left, the sound of the footsteps and the talking, muffled at first, approaches and grows louder, until at times it seems to fill the whole room.",Then it dies away in the distance again.,"The impression is that of some tremendous movement, elemental and irrepressible.","At the table, lighted only by a flickering stump of a tallow candle, sit Speransky and Tony.",The latter is very drunk.,"Cucumbers, herring, and bottles of whiskey are on the table.",The rest of the room is entirely dark.,Occasionally the wind blows the white curtain at the window and sets the candle flame tossing.,Tony and Speransky talk in whispers.,"A prolonged pause

all of one accord, as though we had agreed beforehand, began to sing ""Christ is arisen.""",That's how it happened.,"SAVVA You hear, Lipa?",But what's the matter with you?,Why are you all crying?,"FRIAR It makes one feel so sorry, Mr. Savva.","SAVVA Why, they fooled you, they played a trick on you.","Or else you are all lying, lying with your tears.","_[Kondraty makes a gesture of

SOMEONE IN GRAY CALLED HE, SPEAKING OF THE LIFE OF MAN _A large, rectangular space resembling a room without doors or windows and quite empty.","Everything is gray, monocolored, drab--the watts gray, and the ceiling, and the floor.","A feeble, even light enters from some invisible source.","It too is gray, monotonous, spectral, producing neither lights nor shadows.","Someone in Gray moves noiselessly away from the wall, close against which He has been standing.","He wears a broad, gray, formless smock, vaguely outlining the contours of His body; and a hat of the same gray throws the upper part of His face into heavy shadow.",His eyes are invisible.,"All that is seen are His cheekbones, His nose, and His chin, which is massive, heavy, and blunt, as if hewn out of rock.",His lips are pressed tight together.,"Raising His head slightly, He begins to speak in a firm, cold, unemotional, unimpassioned voice, like a reader hired by the hour reading the Book of Fate with brutal indifference._ SOMEONE IN GRAY Look and listen, you who have come here to laugh and be amused.","There will pass before you the whole life of Man, from his dark beginning to his dark ending.","Previously non-existant, mysteriously hidden in the infiniteness of time, neither feeling nor thinking and known to no one, he will mysteriously break through the prison of non-being and with a cry announce the beginning of his brief life.","In the night of non-existence a light will go up, kindled by an unseen hand.",It is the life of Man.,Behold the flame--it is the life of Man.,"Being born, he will take the form and the name of Man, and in all things will become like other men already living.","And their hard lot will be his lot, and his hard lot will be the lot of all human beings.","Inexorably impelled by time, he will, with inavertible necessity, pass through all the stages of human life, from the bottom to the top, from the top to the bottom.","Limited in vision, he will never see the next step which his unsteady foot, poised in the air, is in the very act of taking.","Limited in knowledge, he will never know what the coming day will bring, or the coming hour, or the coming minute.","In his unseeing blindness, troubled by premonitions, agitated by hope and fear, he will submissively complete the iron-traced circle foreordained.",Behold him a happy youth.,See how brightly the candle burns.,"From boundless stretches of space the icy wind blows, circling, careering, and tossing the flame.",In vain.,Bright and clear the candle burns.,"Yet the wax is dwindling, consumed by the fire.",Yet the wax is dwindling.,Behold him a happy husband and father.,"But see how strangely dim and faint the candle burns, as if the yellowing flame were wrinkling, as if it were shivering with cold and were creeping into concealment.","The wax is melting, consumed by the fire.",The wax is melting.,"Behold him, an old man, ill and feeble.",The stages of life are already ended.,In their stead nothing but a black void.,Yet he drags on with palsied limbs.,"The flame, now turned blue, bends to the ground and crawls along, trembling and falling, trembling and falling.",Then it goes out quietly.,Thus Man will die.,"Coming from the night, he will return to the night and go out, leaving no trace behind.","He will pass into the infinity of time, neither thinking nor feeling, and known to no one.","And I, whom all call He, shall remain the faithful companion of Man throughout his life, on all his pathways.","Unseen by him, I shall be constantly at hand when he wakes and when he sleeps, when he prays and when he curses.","In his hours of joy, when his spirit, free and bold, rises aloft; in his hours of grief and despair, when his soul clouds over with mortal pain and sorrow, and the blood congeals in his heart; in the hours of victory and defeat; in the hours of great strife with the immutable, I shall be with him--I shall be with him.","And you who have come here to be amused, you who are consecrated to death, look and listen.","There will pass before you, like a distant phantom echo, the fleet-moving life of Man with its sorrows and its joys.",_[Someone in Gray turns silent.,"The light goes out, and He and the gray, empty room are enveloped in darkness._ THE FIRST SCENE THE BIRTH OF MAN AND THE MOTHER'S TRAVAIL

but in a palace-- MAN Oh, hang it!","Stop imagining that, then.",Now imagine something else.,The violins are playing a melodious plaint; the flutes are singing gently; the double bass drones like a beetle.,"_[Man sits down, still wearing his oak wreath, and strikes up a dance tune, clapping his hands in accompaniment.",The melody is the same as in the next scene at Man's ball.,The Wife dances.,"She is well-formed and graceful._ MAN Oh, you darling!",WIFE I am the queen of the ball.,_[The song and dance grow ever jollier.,Man rises slowly and begins to dance lightly on the spot where he is standing; then he seizes his Wife and dances with her.,The oak wreath slips to one side.,"Someone in Gray looks on indifferently, the candle burning brightly in his petrified hand._ CURTAIN THE THIRD SCENE A BALL AT MAN'S HOUSE _The ball is in the drawing-room of Man's large mansion.","It is a very lofty, spacious, perfectly rectangular room.",The floor is bright and smooth.,There is a certain irregularity about the room due to the disproportionate size of the parts.,"Thus, the doors are very small in proportion to the windows.","This produces a strange, irritating impression, as of something disharmonious, something lacking, and also of something superfluous and adventitious.","The whole is pervaded by a chilly white, the monotony of which is broken only by a row of windows in the rear wall.","They are very high, reaching almost to the ceiling, and dense with the blackness of night.","Not one gleam, not a bright spot shows in the blank spaces between the window frames.",Man's wealth shows in the abundance of gildings.,"There are gilded chairs, and very wide gold frames enclose the pictures.",These constitute the only furniture as well as the only ornamentation.,"The lighting is from three chandeliers shaped like tings, with a few electric lights placed at a great distance apart.","At the ceiling the light is bright, but considerably less so below, so that the walls seem grayish.",The ball is in full swing.,The music is furnished by an orchestra of three pieces.,"The musicians resemble closely their respective instruments; the violinist, a violin--lean neck, small head, a shock of hair brushed to one side, back somewhat bent, a handkerchief correctly adjusted on his shoulder under the violin; the flute-player, a flute--very, tall, with a thin, elongated face, and stiff, thin legs, the bass-violinist, a double-bass--stumpy, round-shouldered, lower part of his body very stout, wide trousers.",The uncommon effort with which the musicians play is painfully evident.,"They beat time, swing their heads, and shake their bodies.","The tune is the same throughout the ball, a short polka in two musical phrases, producing a jolly, hopping, extremely insipid effect.","The three instruments do not quite keep time with one another, producing a sort of queer detachment, a vacant space, as it were, between them and the sounds which they produce.",Young men and girls are dancing dreamily.,"All are handsome, distinguished-looking, with good figures.","In contrast to the piercing notes of the music, their dancing is smooth, noiseless, light.","At the first musical phrase, they circle around; at the second, they gracefully part and join again.",There is a slight mannerism in their dancing.,"Along the walls, on the gilded chairs, sit the Guests, stiff and constrained.",They scarcely venture to move their heads.,Their conversation is also constrained.,"They do not whisper to one another; they do not laugh, and they scarcely look at one another.","They speak abruptly, as if chopping out the words of a text.",Their hands hanging superciliously over their laps make their arms look as if they had been broken at the wrists.,The monotony of their faces is strongly emphasized.,"Every face bears the same expression of self-satisfaction, haughtiness, and inane respect for the wealth of Man.","The dancing girls are all in white, the men in black.","Some of the Guests wear black, white, and brightly yellow?",flowers.,"In the near corner, which is darker than the rest, Someone in Gray called He stands motionless.","The candle in his hand is reduced two-thirds and burns with a strong, yellow light, casting a yellow sheen on His stony face and chin._ THE GUESTS' CONVERSATION --It is a very great honor to be a guest at Man's ball.","--You may add, it is an honor of which very few have been deemed worthy.","The whole city tried to get themselves invited, but only a very few succeeded.","My husband, my children, and I are quite proud of the honor Man has showed us.",--I am really sorry for those who were not able to get here.,"They won't sleep the whole night from sheer envy, and to-morrow they'll say nasty things about the ball and call it a bore.",--They never saw such magnificence.,--Or such wonderful wealth and luxury.,"--Or, I dare say, such charming, free and easy gayety.","--If this isn't gay, I should like to know what is.","--Oh, what's the use of talking?",You can't convince people consumed by jealousy.,"They'll tell us we didn't sit on gilded chairs, absolutely not.","--They'll say that the chairs were of the commonest sort, bought at second hand.","--That the illumination was not by electricity, but just by tallow candles.",--Say candle stumps.,--Or dirty lamps.,--They'll have the impudence to maintain that the mouldings in Man's house are not gilded.,--And that the broad picture frames are not made of gold.,It seems to me I can hear the very ring of it.,--You can see its glitter.,"That's quite sufficient, I should think.",--I have rarely had the pleasure of hearing such music.,--It is divine harmony.,It transports the soul to higher spheres.,"--I should think the music good enough, considering the money paid for it.",It is the best trio in the city.,They play on the most important and solemn occasions.,"--If you listen awhile, it compels your absolute attention.","After a ball at Man's, my children keep singing the tune a long time.",--I sometimes think I hear it in the street.,"I look around--no musicians, no music.",--What I like especially in these musicians is the great effort they make when they play.,They know the price they're paid and don't want to get the money for nothing.,That's very decent of them.,"--It seems as if they became a part of their instruments, their efforts are so great.",--Or as if the instruments became part of them.,--How rich!,--How magnificent!,--How brilliant!,--How rich!,"_[For some time the two expressions, ""How rich!","How magnificent!""","are repeated from different parts of the room, uttered abruptly, like a bark._ --Beside this ballroom there are fourteen other magnificent rooms in Man's house.",I have seen them all.,The dining-room has such a huge fireplace that you can put a whole log into it.,There are magnificent guest-rooms and a beautiful boudoir.,"A large bedroom, and over the pillows on the beds--just fancy!--canopies!","--Why, how wonderful!",Canopies!,--Did you hear?,Canopies!,--Permit me to continue.,"For their son, the little boy, they have a beautiful bright room of golden yellow wood.",It looks as if the sun were shining into it all the time.,--He is such a fine boy.,He has curly hair that looks like the rays of the sun.,--That's true.,When you look at him you wonder whether the sun has risen.,"--And when you look at his eyes you think: ""Autumn is, gone, and the blue sky is here again.""",--Man loves his son madly.,"He bought him a pony for horseback riding, a nice snow-white pony.","My children-- --Pray, let me continue.",Have I told you yet about the swimming-pool?,--No.,No.,"--A swimming-pool, a perfect marvel.","--What, a swimming-pool!",--Yes.,"And further on is Man's study, full of books, books, books.",They say he's a very learned man.,--You can see it by the books.,--I have seen his garden.,--I haven't.,"--It was entrancing, I must say.",Imagine an emerald-green lawn kept beautifully mowed and trimmed at the edges.,In the middle a path of fine red sand.,--Flowers--even palms.,"--Yes, even palms.","And all the trees trimmed as carefully and precisely as the lawn, some cut in the shape of pyramids, others in the shape of green columns.",There's a lovely fountain and little plaster elves and deer scattered all around in the grass.,--How rich!,--How magnificent!,--How brilliant!,--How rich!,--Man did me the honor of showing me his stables and barns.,I had to tell him how much I admired his horses and carriages.,I was particularly impressed by his motor car.,"--Think of it, he has seven servants; seven--a chef, a woman-cook, two maids, gardeners-- --You forget the coachman and the chauffeur.","--Yes, of course, the coachman and the chauffeur.",--And they themselves do nothing at all.,They are too fine.,"--You must admit, it is a great honor to have been invited to Man's ball.",--Don't you find the music somewhat monotonous?,"--No, I don't, and I'm surprised you do.",Don't you see what kind of musicians they are?,--I should like to hear such music all my life.,That's what I say.,"There's something, in that music that stirs me.",--Me too.,--Me too.,--It is a delicious sensation to abandon oneself to dreams of happiness under the influence of this music!,--To transport oneself in fancy to the astral spheres!,--How fine!,--How rich!,--How magnificent!,_[These phrases are repeated._ --I notice a stir at that door.,Man and his Wife will soon pass through the hall.,--The musicians are working away for dear life.,--There they are!,--They're coming!,"Look, they're coming!","_[Man, his Wife, his Friends, and his Enemies appear in the door on the right, cross the room diagonally to the door on the left.","The dancers go on dancing, but part to make way for them.",The musicians play desperately loud and out of tune.,Man has aged greatly.,His long hair and long beard are beginning to turn gray.,"But his face is manly and handsome, and he walks with calm dignity and an air of coldness.","He looks straight ahead of him, as if not noticing those around him.","His Wife has also aged, but she is still beautiful and walks leaning on his arm.","She too seems not to notice the people around her, but looks straight ahead, with a rather strange, almost fixed expression.",Both are richly dressed.,His Friends follow directly behind Man.,"They resemble one another very much--noble faces, high and candid foreheads, honest eyes.","They walk proudly, throwing out their chests, stepping firmly and confidently, and looking, now to this side, now to that, with condescension and slight disdain.",They wear white roses in their buttonholes.,"Following them at a slight distance come Man's Enemies, also very much resembling one another--mean, cunning faces; low, heavy foreheads; long, ape-like arms.","They walk uneasily, pushing, bending, and hiding behind one another, and casting sharp, mean, envious, sidelong glances from beneath lowered lids.",Yellow roses appear in their buttonholes.,"Thus they pass through the room, slowly and in perfect silence.","The sounds of the steps, the music, and the exclamations of the Guests produce a sharply discordant noise._ GUESTS' CONVERSATION --There they are.",There they are.,What an honor!,--How handsome he is!,--What a manly face!,--Look!,Look!,--He isn't looking at us!,--He doesn't see us!,--We are his guests!,--What an honor!,What an honor!,--And his wife!,Look!,Look!,--How beautiful she is!,--How proud!,"--I tell you, just look at her diamonds!",--Her pearls!,Her pearls!,--And her rubies!,--How rich!,What an honor!,--Honor!,Honor!,Honor!,_[The same phrases are repeated again._ --Here are Man's Friends!,"--Look, look, there are Man's Friends.",--Noble faces!,--Proud gait!,--They shine with the reflected splendor of his fame.,--How they love him!,--How faithful they are to him!,--What an honor to be one of Man's Friends!,--They regard everything here as their own!,--They're at home here!,--What an honor!,--Honor!,Honor!,Honor!,_[Same phrases are repeated._ --And there are Man's Enemies!,"--Look, look, Man's Enemies!",--They walk like whipped curs!,--Man has subdued them!,--He's put a muzzle on them!,--They're wagging their tails!,--They're sneaking behind one another.,--They're pushing one another.,--Ha-ha!,Ha-ha!,_[Everybody laughs._ --What mean faces!,--What greedy looks!,--Cowardly!,--Malevolent!,--They're afraid to look at us!,--They feel we're at home!,--Let's frighten them.,--Man'll be thankful to us for it.,--Ho-ho!,"_[They shout at Man's Enemies, mingling their shouts with laughter.","The Enemies huddle closer together and cast sharp, timid, sideward glances._ --They're going!",They're going!,--What an honor!,--They're going!,--Ho-ho!,Ha-ha!,--They're gone!,They're gone!,They're gone!,_[The procession disappears through the door on the left.,A pause of silence.,"The music plays less loudly, and the dancers begin gradually to fill the hall._ --Where did they go?","--I believe they went to the dining-room, where supper is being served.",--I suppose they'll soon invite us in.,Do you see anybody looking for us?,"--Yes, it's time for supper.","If you eat too late, you can't sleep well.",--I always serve supper early.,--A late supper lies heavy on your stomach.,--And the music is still playing.,--And they're still dancing.,--I wonder they don't get tired.,--How rich!,--How magnificent!,--Do you know for how many guests they have prepared the supper?,--I didn't get a chance to count all the covers.,"The caterer came in, and I had to get out.",--Could they possibly have forgotten us?,"--Man is so proud, and we are so unimportant.",--Don't say that.,My husband says we do him an honor by accepting his invitation.,"We are rich, too.",--When you consider the reputation of his wife-- --Do you see anyone looking for us?,Maybe he's looking for us in the other rooms.,--How rich!,"--If you are not careful with other people's money, it's easy to get rich, I think.","--Oh, now, it's only his enemies who say that.","--Well, after all, there are some very respectable people among them.","I must admit that my husband-- --It is late, though.",--It's clear there must be a mistake somewhere.,I can't believe we've simply been forgotten.,--Evidently you know people and life very little if you think so.,--I am surprised.,We are rich enough ourselves.,--It seems to me someone called us.,"--You're mistaken, no one called us.",I don't understand it.,"To be quite frank--why did we come to a house like this, with such a reputation?",One should be very careful of the friends one chooses.,A LIVERIED LACKEY _(appears at the door)_ Man and his Wife beg the honored guests to step into the dining-room.,GUESTS _(rising quickly)_ --What a livery!,--He asked us to come in!,--I said there must be a mistake somewhere.,--Man is so good.,I'm sure he hasn't had a chance to sit down at table himself.,--Didn't I say someone was looking for us?,--What a livery!,--They say the supper is grand.,--Everything at Man's is done in a grand style.,--What music!,What an honor to be at Man's ball!,--Let those envy us who-- --How grand!,--How magnificent!,--What an honor!,"_[They go out one after the other, repeating the last phrases.",One couple after the other stop dancing and follow the Guests in silence.,"For some time a single couple remain circling on the floor, but they too join the others at last.","The musicians, however, continue to play, making the same desperate effort.","The lackey turns out the electric lights, leaving only one light in the farthest chandelier.","The figures of the musicians are vaguely seen in the dim light, swaying to and fro with their instruments.",The outline of Someone in Gray is sharply visible.,"The flame of the candle flickers, illuminating His stony face and chin with a garish, yellow light.","He turns around without raising his head, walks slowly and calmly through the whole length of the room, and disappears through the door through which Man passed out._ CURTAIN THE FOURTH SCENE MAN'S MISFORTUNE _A large, gloomy, quadrangular room, with dark watts, dark floor, and dark ceiling.","There are two high, curtainless windows with eight panes in the rear watt, and between them a small, low door.",Two similar windows appear in the right wall.,"Night glooms through the windows, and when the door opens, the same deep blackness of night stares into the room.","In general, however bright Man's rooms may be, the vast darkness of the windows engulfs the light.","On the left wall there is nothing but a small, low door leading to the rest of the house.",At the window on the right stands a broad sofa covered with dark oilcloth.,Man's desk is very simple and poor.,"On it are seen a dimly burning, shaded lamp, a sheet of yellow paper with a sketch drawn on it, and a lot of toys--little peaked cap, a wooden horse without a tail, and a red, long-nosed clown with bells.",Between the windows there is an old dilapidated bookcase entirely empty.,The visible lines of dust left by the books show that they must have been removed recently.,The room has only one chair.,In the darkest corner stands Someone in Gray called He.,The candle in his hand is now no longer than it is thick.,The wax is running over a little.,"The stump burns with a reddish, flickering light, and casts a red sheen on His stony face and chin.","The only remaining servant of Man, an Old Woman, is sitting on the chair.","She speaks in an even voice, addressing an imaginary companion._ OLD WOMAN There!",Man has slipped back into poverty.,"He had a lot of valuable things, horses and carriages, and even an automobile.",Now he has nothing.,Of all his servants I am the only one left.,There are still some good things in here and in two other rooms.,There's the sofa and the bookcase.,But in the other twelve rooms there's not a thing.,They are dark and empty.,Rats run around in them day and night and fight and squeak.,"People are afraid, but I'm not.",It's all the same to me.,"An iron sign has been hanging on the gate for ever so long, saying the house is for sale.",But no one wants to buy it.,"The sign's rusty already, and the rain has worn the letters away.",But no one comes to buy the house.,No one wants an old house.,Yet maybe someone will buy it.,Then we'll be going to look for another place to live in.,It'll be a strange place.,"My mistress will begin to cry, and I dare say, the old gentleman will too.",But I won't.,It's all the same to me.,You wonder what's become of all his riches.,I don't know.,"Maybe it seems strange, but I've been living with other people all my life, and many is the time I've seen money disappear, quietly running off through some leak or other.",That's the way it has happened to these folks too.,"They had a lot, then it got to be a little, and then nothing at all.",People came and bought things.,Then they stopped coming.,I once asked my mistress how it came about.,"She answered: ""People have stopped liking what they used to like; they have stopped loving what they used to love.""","""How is that possible?""",says I.,"""How can people stop liking what they once liked?""",She didn't answer and fell to crying.,But I didn't.,It's all the same to me.,It's all the same to me.,People say they are surprised at me.,"It's terrible, they say, to live in this house; terrible to sit here at night with only the wind whining in the chimney and the rats squeaking and scuffling.","Maybe it is terrible, I don't know; but I don't think about it.",Why should I?,"There they sit, the two of them, in their room, looking at each other and listening to the whining of the wind; and I sit in the kitchen alone and listen to the whining of the wind.",Doesn't the same wind whine in our ears?,"Young folks used to come to see their son, and they would all laugh and sing and go through the empty rooms to chase the rats.","But nobody comes to me, and I sit alone, all alone.","There's no one to talk to, so I talk to myself, and it's all the same to me.",I'm sure they had a hard enough time of it--no need of more ill luck.,But three days ago another misfortune

arranged in regular rows.,"Behind a low table sits the Bartender, immobile, with his hands folded across his paunch.",His white face is blotched with red.,"His head is bald, and he has a large, reddish beard.","He wears an expression of utter calm and indifference, which he maintains throughout, never changing his seat or his attitude.","Drunkards, both men and women, sit at small tables on wooden stools.",Their number seems to be augmented by their shadows dancing on the walls and ceiling.,It is one endless monotony of repulsive ugliness and desolation.,"The men's faces resemble masks with the various features disproportionately magnified or reduced: big noses, or no noses at all; eyes staring savagely, almost starting from their sockets, or eyes narrowed to scarcely visible slits and points; huge Adam's apples and tiny chins.","Their hair is tangled, frowzy, dirty, covering half the face on some of them.","Despite their differences, a horrible sameness is stamped upon their faces: a greenish, ghastly tinge of decay and an expression that appears grotesque in some, gloomy and stupidly timid in others.","They are dressed in dull rags, with here a bony arm bared, there a sharp knee, and there again a frightfully sunken chest.",Some are almost entirely naked.,"The women differ little from the men, except that they are even uglier and more uncouth.","All have trembling heads and hands and walk with an uncertain step, as if on a slippery, or hilly, or sliding surface.","Their voices, too, are all alike, rough and hoarse.","They speak as uncertainly as they walk, as if their lips were frozen and refused to obey.","In the centre, at a separate table, sits Man, his gray, unkempt head leaning on his arms.","In this position he remains throughout the scene, except

suppressed and quiet at first.","As each one glides past Man, she flings an abrupt whisper into his ear_: --Do you remember?",--Do you remember?,--How gentle!,How exquisite!,--What balm to the soul!,Do you remember?,"--You're going to die soon, you're going to die soon.",--You're going to die soon-- --Do you remember?,"_[They circle more quickly, their movements growing still more abrupt.",Suddenly there is silence and they halt.,The musicians grow rigid with the instruments in their hands.,The dancers remain fixed in the game position in which they were when the silence fell.,"Man rises, straightens himself, throws back his gray, beautiful, terribly majestic head, and calls out in a surprisingly loud voice, full of sorrow and wrath.",After each short phrase a brief but profound pause follows._ MAN Where is my squire?,Where is my sword?,Where is my shield?,I am disarmed!,Come to me quick!,Quick!,"Be accurs-- _[He sinks down on the chair and dies, his head falling backward.",At the same moment the candle flares up brightly and goes out.,All objects are buried in a dense twilight which seems to be descending the stairs until it gradually covers everything.,The face of dead Man alone remains bright.,"Low, vague conversation, whisperings and derisive mockery are heard from the Old Women._ SOMEONE IN GRAY Silence!",Man has died!,_[Profound silence.,"Then the same cold, indifferent voice repeats from a remote depth, like an echo_: Silence!",Man has died!,_[Profound silence.,"The twilight thickens, but the mice-like figures of the Old Women are still seen standing rigid.","Presently they begin to circle about the dead body mutely, quietly; then they begin to sing softly, and the musicians begin to play.","The gloom thickens, the music and the song grow louder and louder, and the wild dance grows more unrestrained, until finally it ceases to be a dance, the Old Women merely whirling about the dead man arm in arm, stamping their feet, screeching, and laughing a wild, prolonged laugh.",Complete darkness descends.,Only the face of Man is still lighted up.,Then this light too is extinguished.,Black impenetrable darkness prevails.,"In the darkness are heard the movements of the mad dancers, their screeching and laughter, and the discordant, desperately loud sounds of the music.","Just when they have reached their highest pitch, all the sounds and noises withdraw rapidly somewhere and die away.","Stillness._ CURTAIN End of Project Gutenberg's Savva and The Life of Man, by Leonid Andreyev *** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SAVVA AND THE

CHRONOLOGICAL LIST OF PLAYS BY LEONID ANDREYEV SAVVA THE LIFE OF MAN INTRODUCTION For the last twenty years Leonid Andreyev and Maxim Gorky have by turns occupied the centre of the stage of Russian literature.",Prophetic vision is no longer required for an estimate of their permanent contribution to the intellectual and literary development of Russia.,It represents the highest ideal expression of a period in Russian history that was pregnant with stirring and far-reaching events--the period of revolution and counter-revolution.,"It was a period when Russian society passed from mood to mood at an extremely rapid tempo: from energetic aggressiveness, exultation, high hope, and confident trust in the triumph of the people's cause to apathetic inaction, gloom, despair, frivolity, and religious mysticism.",This important dramatic epoch in the national life of Russia Andreyev and Gorky wrote down with such force and passion that they became recognized at once as the leading exponents of their time.,"Despite this close external association, their work differs essentially in character.","In fact, it is scarcely possible to conceive of greater artistic contrasts.","Gorky is plain, direct, broad, realistic, elemental.","His art is native, not acquired.","Civilization and what learning he obtained later through the reading of books have influenced, not the manner or method of his writing, but only its purpose and occasionally its subject matter.","It is significant to watch the dismal failure Gorky makes of it whenever, in concession to the modern literary fashion, he attempts the mystical.",Symbolism is foreign to him except in its broadest aspects.,"His characters, though hailing from a world but little known, and often extreme and extremely peculiar, are on the whole normal.","Andreyev, on the other hand, is a child of civilization, steeped in its culture, and while as rebellious against some of the things of civilization as Gorky, he reacts to them in quite a different way.","He is wondrously sensitive to every development, quickly appropriates what is new, and always keeps in the vanguard.","His art is the resultant of all that the past ages have given us, of the things that we have learned in our own day, and of what we are just now learning.","With this art Andreyev succeeds in communicating ideas, thoughts, and feelings so fine, so tenuous, so indefinite as to appear to transcend human expression.","He does not care whether the things he writes about are true, whether his characters are real.",What he aims to give is a true impression.,"And to convey this impression he does not scorn to use mysticism, symbolism, or even plain realism.","His favorite characters are degenerates, psychopaths, abnormal eccentrics, or just creatures of fancy corresponding to no reality.","Frequently, however, the characters, whether real or unreal, are as such of merely secondary importance, the chief aim being the interpretation of an idea or set of ideas, and the characters functioning primarily only as a medium for the embodiment of those ideas.",In one respect Gorky and Andreyev are completely at one--in their bold aggressiveness.,"The emphatic tone, the attitude of attack, first introduced into Russian literature by Gorky, was soon adopted by most of his young contemporaries, and became the characteristic mark of the literature of the Revolution.",By that token the literature of Young Russia of that day is as easily recognized as is the English literature of the Dryden and Pope epoch by its sententiousness.,It contrasts sharply with the tone of passive resignation and hopelessness of the preceding period.,"Even Chekhov, the greatest representative of what may be called the period of despondence, was caught by the new spirit of optimism and activism, so that he reflected clearly the new influence in his later works.","But while in Gorky the revolt is chiefly social--manifesting itself through the world of the submerged tenth, the disinherited masses, _les misérables_, who, becoming conscious of their wrongs, hurl defiance at their oppressors, make mock of their civilization, and threaten the very foundations of the old order--Andreyev transfers his rebellion to the higher regions of thought and philosophy, to problems that go beyond the merely better or worse social existence, and asks the larger, much more difficult questions concerning the general destiny of man, the meaning of life and the reason for death.","Social problems, it is true, also interest Andreyev.","""The Red Laugh"" is an attack on war through a portrayal of the ghastly horrors of the Russo-Japanese War; ""Savva,"" one of the plays of this volume, is taken bodily (with a poet's license, of course) from the actual revolutionary life of Russia; ""King Hunger"" is the tragedy of the uprising of the hungry masses and the underworld.","Indeed, of the works written during the conflict and for some time afterward, all centre more or less upon the social problems which then agitated Russia.",But with Andreyev the treatment of all questions tends to assume a universal aspect.,"He envisages phenomena from a broad, cosmic point of view; he beholds things _sub specie aeternitatis._ The philosophical tendency of his mind, though amply displayed even in works like ""Savva""--which is purely a character and social drama--manifests itself chiefly by his strong propensity for such subjects as those treated in ""To the Stars,"" ""The Life of Man,"" and ""Anathema.""","In these plays Andreyev plunges into the deepest problems of existence, and seeks to posit once more and, if possible, to solve in accordance with the modern spirit and modern knowledge those questions over which the mightiest brains of man have labored for centuries: Whence?",Whither?,What is the significance of man's life?,Why is death?,"If Spinoza's dictum be true, that ""a wise man's meditation is not of death but of life,"" then Andreyev is surely not a wise man.","Some philosophers might have written their works even without a guarantee against immortality, though Schopenhauer, who exercised a influence on the young Andreyev, was of the opinion that ""without death there would hardly be any philosophy""; but of Andreyev it is certain that the bulk of his works would not have been written, and could not be what they are, were it not for the fact of death.","If there is one idea that can be said to dominate the author of ""The Life of Man,"" it is the idea of death.","Constantly he keeps asking: Why all this struggling, all this pain, all this misery in the world, if it must end in nothing?","The suffering of the great mass of mankind makes life meaningless while it lasts, and death puts an end even to this life.",Again and again Andreyev harks back to the one thought from which all his other thoughts seem to flow as from their fountain-head.,"Lazarus, in the story by that name, is but the embodiment of death.","All who behold him, who look into his eyes, are never again the same as they were; indeed, most of them are utterly ruined.","""The Seven Who Were Hanged"" tells how differently different persons take death.","Grim death lurks in the background of almost every work, casting a fearful gloom, mocking the life of man, laughing to scorn his joys and his sorrows, propounding, sphinx-like, the big riddle that no Oedipus will ever be able to solve.","For it is not merely the destructive power of death, not merely its negation of life, that terrifies our author.","The pitchy darkness that stretches beyond, the impossibility of penetrating the veil that separates existence from non-existence--in a word, the riddle of the universe--is, to a mind constituted like Andreyev's, a source of perhaps even greater disquiet.","Never was a man hungrier than he with ""the insatiable hunger for Eternity""; never was a man more eager to pierce the mystery of life and catch a glimpse of the beyond while yet alive.",Combined with the perplexing darkness that so pitifully limits man's vision is the indifference of the forces that govern his destiny.,"The wrongs he suffers may cry aloud to heaven, but heaven does not hear him.","Whether he writhe in agony or be prostrated in the dust (against all reason and justice), he has no appeal, societies, the bulk of mankind, may be plunged in misery--who or what cares?",Man is surrounded by indifference as well as by darkness.,"Often, when an idea has gained a powerful hold on Andreyev, he pursues it a long time, presenting it under various aspects, until at last it assumes its final form, rounded and completed, as it were, in some figure or symbol.","As such it appears either as the leading theme of an entire story or drama, or as an important subordinate theme.",Thus we have seen that the idea of death finds concrete expression in the character of Lazarus.,"The idea of loneliness, of the isolation of the individual from all other human beings, even though he be physically surrounded by large numbers, is embodied in the story of ""The City.""","Similarly the conception of the mystery and the indifference by which man finds himself confronted is definitely set forth in the figure of _Someone in Gray_ in ""The Life of Man.""","The riddle, the indifference--these are the two characteristics of human destiny that loom large in Andreyev's conception of it as set forth in that figure.",_Someone in Gray_--who is he?,No one knows.,"No definite name can be given him, for no one knows.","He is mysterious in ""The Life of Man,"" where he is _Man's_ constant companion; he is mysterious in ""Anathema,"" where he guards the gate leading from this finite world to eternity.","And as _Man's_ companion he looks on indifferently, apparently unconcerned whether _Man_ meets with good or bad fortune.",_Man's_ prayers do not move him.,_Man's_ curses leave him calm.,"It is Andreyev's gloomy philosophy, no doubt, that so often causes him to make his heroes lonely, so that loneliness is developed into a principle of human existence, in some cases, as in ""The City,"" becoming the dominant influence over a man's life.","Particularly the men whom life has treated senselessly and cruelly, whom it has dealt blow after blow until their spirits are crushed out--it is such men in particular who become lonely, seek isolation and retirement, and slink away into some hole to die alone.","This is the significance of the saloon scene in ""The Life of Man.""","The environment of the drunkards who are withdrawn from life, and therefore lonely themselves, accentuates the loneliness of _Man_ in the last scene.",It is his loneliness that Andreyev desired to bring into relief.,"His frequenting the saloon is but an immaterial detail, one of the means of emphasizing this idea.","To remove all possible misunderstanding on this point, Andreyev wrote a variant of the last scene, ""The Death of Man,"" in which, instead of dying in a saloon surrounded by drunkards, _Man_ dies in his own house surrounded by his heirs.","""The _loneliness_ of the dying and unhappy man,"" Andreyev wrote in a prefatory note to this variant, ""may just as fully be characterized by the presence of the _Heirs._"" However, for all the gloom of his works, Andreyev is not a pessimist.","Under one of his pictures he has written: ""Though it destroys individuals, the truth saves mankind.""","The misery in the world may be ever so great; the problems that force themselves upon man's mind may seem unanswerable; the happenings in the external world may fill his soul with utter darkness, so that he despairs of finding any meaning, any justification in life.","And yet, though his reason deny it, his soul tells him: ""The truth saves mankind.""","After all, _Man_ is not a failure.","For though misfortunes crowd upon him, he remains intact in soul, unbroken in spirit.",He carries off the victory because he does not surrender.,"He dies as a superman, big in his defiance of destiny.",This must be the meaning Andreyev attached to _Man's_ life.,"We find an interpretation of it, as it were, in ""Anathema,"" in which _Someone_ sums up the fate of _David_--who lived an even sadder life than _Man_ and died a more horrible death--in these words: ""David has achieved immortality, and he _lives immortal_ in the deathlessness of fire.","David has achieved immortality, and he _lives immortal_ in the deathlessness of light which is life.""",Andreyev was born at Orel in 1871 and was graduated from the gymnasium there.,"According to his own testimony, he never seems to have been a promising student.","""In the seventh form,"" he tells us, ""I was always at the bottom of my class.""","He lost his father early, and often went hungry while studying law at the University of St. Petersburg.","In the University of Moscow, to which he went next, he fared better.","One of the means that he used to eke out a livelihood was portrait painting to order, and in this work he finally attained such proficiency that his price rose from $1.50 apiece to $6.00.","In 1897 he began to practise law, but he gave most of his time to reporting court cases for the ""Courier,"" a Moscow newspaper, and later to writing _feuilletons_ and stories.","He tried only one civil case, and that one he lost.","His work in the

immediately.","Even Countess Tolstoy joined in the dispute which raged over this story, attacking it as matter unfit for literature.",But the verdict of Andreyev's generation was in his favor.,Since then nearly every new work of his has been received as an important event in Russia and has sent the critics scurrying to his attack or defence.,"His first drama, ""To the Stars,"" appeared while the Russians were engaged in fighting for liberty (1905), and, naturally enough, it reflects that struggle.","""Savva"" was published early the next year, and ""The Life of Man"" later in the same

of monastic severity in her dress._ SAVVA, _twenty-three, large, broad-shouldered, with a suggestion of the peasant in his looks.","He walks with a slight stoop, elbows out, feet in.","The motions of his hands are rounded and graceful, his palms being turned up as if he were carrying something.","His features are large and rough-hewn, and his cheeks and chin are covered with a soft light down.","When agitated or angry, he turns gray as dust, his movements become quick and agile, and his stoop disappears.","He wears the blouse and boots of a workingman._ PELAGUEYA, _a freckled, colorless woman, of about thirty, wearing the ordinary dress of her class.","She is dirty and untidy._ SPERANSKY GRIGORY PETROVICH, _an ex-seminarist; tall, very lean, with a pale, long face, and a

SAVVA THE FIRST ACT _The interior of a house in a monastic suburb.,"Two rooms, with a third seen back of them.","They are old, ramshackle, and filthy.","The first one is a sort of dining-room, large, with dirty, low ceiling and smeared wall-paper that in places has come loose from the wall.","There are three little windows; the one giving on the yard reveals a shed, a wagon, and some household utensils.","Cheap wooden furniture; a large, bare table.","On the walls, which are dotted with flies, appear pictures of monks and views of the monastery.","The second room, a parlor, is somewhat cleaner.","It has window curtains of muslin, two flower-pots with dried geraniums, a sofa, a round table covered with a tablecloth, and shelves with dishes.",The door to the left in the first room leads to the tavern.,"When open, it admits the sound of a man's doleful, monotonous singing.",It is noon of a hot and perfectly still summer's day.,Now and then the clucking of hens is heard under the windows.,"The clock in the belfry of the monastery strikes every half-hour, a long, indistinct wheeze preceding the first stroke.","Pelagueya, who is pregnant, is scrubbing the floor.","Seized with

least.",Were you in the monastery to-day?,"You go there often, don't you?","SAVVA Yes, I was there.",Why?,LIPA I suppose you don't remember--I love our monastery.,It is so beautiful.,At times it looks so pensive.,I like it because it's so old.,"Its age gives it a solemnity, a stern serenity and detachment.",SAVVA Do you read many books?,LIPA _(blushing)_ I used to read a lot.,You know I spent four winters in Moscow with Aunt Glasha.,Why do you ask?,SAVVA Never mind.,Go on.,LIPA Does what I say sound ridiculous?,"SAVVA No, go on.",LIPA The monastery is really a remarkable place.,"There are nice spots there which no one ever visits, somewhere between the mute walls, where there is nothing but grass and fallen stones and a lot of old, old litter.","I love to linger there, especially at twilight, or on hot sunny days like to-day.","I close my eyes, and I seem to look far, far into the distant past--at those who built it and those who first prayed in it.","There they walk along the path carrying bricks and singing something, so softly, so far away.","_(Closing her eyes)_ So softly, so softly.",SAVVA I don't like the old.,"As to the building of the monastery, it was done by serfs, of course; and when they carried bricks they didn't sing, but quarrelled and cursed one another.",That's more like it.,LIPA _(opening her eyes)_ Those are my dreams.,"You see, Savva, I am all alone here.",I have nobody to talk to.,"Tell me--You won't be angry, will you?--Tell me, just me alone, why did you come here to us?",It wasn't to pray.,It wasn't for the feast-day.,You don't look like a pilgrim.,SAVVA _(frowning)_ I don't like you to be so curious.,LIPA How can you think I am?,Do I look as if I were curious?,"You have been here for two weeks, and you ought to see that I am lonely.","I am lonely, Savva.",Your coming was to me like manna fallen from the sky.,"You are the first living human being that has come here from over there, from real life.","In Moscow I lived very quietly, just reading my books; and here--you see the sort of people we have here.",SAVVA Do you think it's different in other places?,LIPA I don't know.,That's what I should like to find out from you.,You have seen so much.,You have even been abroad.,SAVVA Only for a short time.,LIPA That makes no difference.,"You have met many cultured, wise, interesting people.",You have lived with them.,How do they live?,What kind of people are they?,Tell me all about it.,"SAVVA A mean, contemptible lot.",LIPA Is that so?,You don't say so!,"SAVVA They live just as you do here--a stupid, senseless existence.",The only difference is in the language they speak.,But that makes it still worse.,"The justification for cattle is that, they are without speech.","But when the cattle become articulate, begin to speak, defend themselves and express ideas then the situation becomes intolerable, unmitigatedly repulsive.",Their dwelling-places are different too--yes--but that's a small thing.,I was in a city inhabited by a hundred thousand people.,The windows in the house of that city are all small.,"Those living in them are all fond of light, but it never occurs to anyone that the windows might be made larger.","And when a new house is built, they put in the same kind of windows, just as small, just as they have always been.",LIPA The idea!,I never would have thought it.,But they can't all be like that.,You must have met good people who knew how to live.,SAVVA I don't know how to make you understand.,"Yes, I did meet, if not altogether good people, yet--The last people with whom I lived were a pretty good sort.","They didn't accept life ready-made, but tried to make it over to suit themselves.",But-- LIPA Who were they--students?,SAVVA No.,Look here--how about your tongue--is it of the loose kind?,"LIPA Savva, you ought to be ashamed!",SAVVA All right.,Now then.,"You've read of people who make bombs--little bombs, you understand?","Now if they see anybody who interferes with life, they take him off.",They're called anarchists.,But that isn't quite correct.,_(Contemptuously)_ Nice anarchists they are!,"LIPA _(starting back, awestruck)_ What are you talking about?",You can't possibly be in earnest.,It isn't true.,"And you in it, too?","Why, you look so simple and talk so simply, and suddenly--I was hot a moment ago, but now I am cold, _(The rooster crows-under the window, calling the chickens to share some seed he has found)_ SAVVA There now--you're frightened.","First you want me to tell you, and then-- LIPA Don't mind me, Savva, it's nothing.",It was so unexpected.,I thought such people didn't really exist--that they were just a fiction of the imagination.,"And then, all of a sudden, to find you, my brother--You are not joking, Savva?",Look me straight in the eye.,SAVVA But why did you get frightened?,They are not so terrible after all.,"In fact, they are very quiet, orderly people, and very deliberate.","They meet and meet, and weigh and consider a long time, and then--bang!--a sparrow drops dead.","The next minute there is another sparrow in its place, hopping about on the very same branch.",Why are you looking at my hands?,"LIPA Oh, nothing.","Give me your hand--no, your right hand.",SAVVA Here.,LIPA How heavy it is.,Feel how cold mine are.,"Go on, tell me all about it.",It's so interesting.,SAVVA What's there to tell?,"They are a brave set of people, I must admit; but it is a bravery of the head, not of the hands.",And their heads are partitioned off into little chambers; they are always careful not to do anything which is unnecessary or harmful.,"Now you can't clear a dense forest by cutting down one tree at a time, can you?",That's what they do.,"While they chop at one end, it grows up at the other.",You can't accomplish anything that way; it's labor lost.,"I proposed a scheme to them, something on a larger scale.","They got frightened, wouldn't hear of it.",A little weak-kneed they are.,So I left them.,Let them practise virtue.,A narrow-minded bunch.,They lack breadth of vision.,LIPA You say it as calmly as if you were joking.,"SAVVA No, I am not joking.",LIPA Aren't you afraid?,SAVVA I?,"So far I

haven't been frightened so far by watching life, there's nothing else to fear.","Life, yes.","I embrace the earth with my eyes, the whole of it, the entire little planetoid, and I can find nothing more terrible on it than man and human life.",And I am not afraid of man.,"LIPA _(scarcely listening to him; ecstatically)_ Yes, that's the word.",That's it.,"Savva, dear, I am not afraid of bodily suffering either.",Burn me on a slow fire.,Cut me to pieces.,I won't cry.,I'll laugh.,I know I will.,But there is another thing I am afraid of.,"I am afraid of people's suffering, of the misery from which they cannot escape.","When in the stillness of the night, broken only by the striking of the hours, I think of how much suffering there is all around us--aimless, needless suffering; suffering

people joy, give them peace, give them forgetfulness.","Oh, Lord, all powerful as Thou art--"" SAVVA Yes.","LIPA I have read about a man who was eaten by an eagle, and his flesh grew again overnight.","If my body could turn into bread and joy for the people, I would consent to live in eternal torture in order to feed the unfortunate.",There'll soon be a holiday here in the monastery-- SAVVA I know.,"LIPA There is an ikon of the Saviour there with the touching inscription: ""Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden-- SAVVA And I will give you rest.""",I know.,LIPA It is regarded as a wonder-working ikon.,Go there on the feast-day.,"It's like a torrent pouring into the monastery, an ocean rolling toward its walls; and this whole ocean is made up entirely of human tears, of human sorrow and misery.","Such monstrosities, such cripples.","After witnessing one of those scenes, I walk about as in a dream.",There are faces with such a depth of misery in them that one can never forget them as long as one lives.,"Why, Savva, I was a gay young thing before I saw all that.",There is one man who comes here every year--they have nicknamed him King Herod-- SAVVA He is here already.,I've seen him.,LIPA Have you?,"SAVVA Yes, he has got a tragic face.","LIPA Long ago, when still a young man, he killed his son by accident, and from that day he keeps coming here.",He has an awful face.,And all of them are waiting for a miracle.,SAVVA Yes.,"There is something worse than inescapable human suffering, however.",LIPA What?,SAVVA _(lightly)_ Inescapable human stupidity.,LIPA I don't know.,SAVVA I do.,"Here you see only a small fragment of life, but if you could see and hear all of it--When I first read their newspapers, I laughed and thought it was a joke.",I thought they were published in some asylum for the insane.,But I found it was no joke.,"It was really serious, Lipa, really serious.",And then my head began to ache with an intolerable pain.,_(He presses his hand to his forehead)_ LIPA Your head began to ache?,SAVVA Yes.,It's a peculiar pain.,You don't know what it is like.,Few people know what it is.,And the pain continued until I resolved-- LIPA What?,SAVVA To annihilate everything.,LIPA What are you saying?,"SAVVA Yes, yes, everything.",All that's old.,LIPA _(in amazement)_ And man?,"SAVVA Man is to remain, of course.","What is in his way is the stupidity that, piling up for thousands of years, has grown into a mountain.","The modern sages want to build on this mountain, but that, of course, will lead to nothing but making the mountain still higher.",It is the mountain itself that must be removed.,"It must be levelled to its foundation, down to the bare earth.",Do you understand?,"LIPA No, I don't understand you.",You talk so strangely.,SAVVA Annihilate everything!,"The old houses, the old cities, the old literature, the old art.",Do you know what art is?,"LIPA Yes, of course I know--pictures, statues.",I went to the Tretyakov art gallery.,"SAVVA That's it--the Tretyakov, and other galleries that are bigger still.","There are some good things in them, but it will be still better to have the old stuff out of the way.",All the old dress must go.,Man must be stripped bare and left naked on a naked earth!,Then he will build up a new life.,"The earth must be denuded, Lipa; it must be stripped of its hideous old rags.",It deserves to be arrayed in a king's mantle; but what have they done with it?,"They have dressed it in coarse fustian, in convict clothes.","They've built cities, the idiots!",LIPA

science.,That would be useless.,"Science is unchangeable, and if, you destroyed it to-day, it would rise up again the same as before.",LIPA How much blood will have to be shed?,"Why, it's horrible!","SAVVA No more than has been shed already--and there'll be rhyme and reason to it, at least.","_(Pause; the hens cluck in the yard; from the same direction comes Tony's sleepy voice_:

still!,SAVVA All right.,"And Kondraty, isn't here yet.",I wonder why.,Do you think the devil has taken him?,"The devil is fond of monks, you know.",LIPA What strange fancies you have.,"Why, now you are joking-- SAVVA _(somewhat surprised)_ They are not fancies.",LIPA My fancies are different.,"You are a dear now, because you talk to me.",In the evening I'll tell you all about myself.,"We'll take a walk together, and I'll tell you everything.","SAVVA Very well, I'll listen.",Why shouldn't I?,"LIPA Tell me, Savva, if I may ask--are you in love with a woman?","SAVVA Ah, switched around to the subject of love after all--just like a woman!",I hardly know what to say.,"I did love a girl, in a way, but she didn't stick it out.",LIPA Stick out what?,"SAVVA My love, or perhaps myself.",All I know is that one fine day she went away and left me.,LIPA _(laughing)_ And you?,SAVVA Nothing.,I remained alone.,"LIPA Have you any friends, comrades?",SAVVA No.,LIPA Any enemies?,"I mean is there

way!,You've gone out of your mind!,SAVVA Ah!,"I touched your sensitive spot, did I?",LIPA Don't you dare!,"SAVVA I thought you were a gentle dove, but you have a tongue like a snake's.",_(He imitates the movements of a snake's tongue with his finger)_ LIPA Good Lord!,"How dare you, how can you speak like that of the Saviour?","Why, one dares not look at him.",Why have you come here?,"_[Kondraty appears at the door of the tavern, looks around, and enters quietly._ KONDRATY In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost!",SAVVA Amen!,"You're very late, my gracious lord!",KONDRATY I did the will of him who sent me.,I was picking young little cucumbers for the Father Superior.,He has them made into a dainty dish which he loves dearly for an appetizer.,"My, what infernal heat!",I was in pools of perspiration before I got through.,"SAVVA _(to Lipa)_ You see, here is a monk.",He likes a drink.,His cussing vocabulary isn't bad.,"He is no fool, and as to women-- KONDRATY Don't embarrass the young lady, Mr. Tropinin.","In the presence of a lady-- SAVVA And furthermore, he doesn't believe in God.",KONDRATY He is joking.,LIPA I don't like such jokes.,What have you come here for?,KONDRATY I am here by invitation.,SAVVA I have some business with him.,LIPA _(without looking at Savva)_ What have you come here for?,SAVVA For nothing that concerns you.,You had better have a talk with him.,He is a chap that possesses a great deal of curiosity.,"He's not a fool, either, but knows what's what.","LIPA _(looking searchingly at Savva)_ I know him well, I know him very well.",KONDRATY To my regret I must admit it's true.,I have the unenviable fortune of being known as a man who does not observe the outer forms of conduct.,"It is on account of that characteristic I was fired from my position as government clerk, and it's on that account I am now frequently condemned to live for weeks on nothing but bread and water.",I cannot act in secret.,I am open and above-board.,"In fact, I fairly cry aloud whatever I do.","For example, the circumstances under which I met you, Mr. Tropinin, are such that I am ashamed to recall them.",SAVVA Don't recall them then.,"KONDRATY _(to Lipa)_ I was lying in a mud puddle in all my dignity, like a regular hog.",LIPA _(disgusted)_ All right.,"KONDRATY But I am not ashamed to speak of it; first, because many people saw it, and of course nobody took the trouble to get me out of it except Savva Yegorovich, and secondly, because I regard this as my cross.",LIPA A fine cross!,"KONDRATY Every man, Miss Olympiada, has his cross.",It isn't so very nice to be lying in a mud puddle.,Dry ground is pleasanter every time.,"And do you know, I think half of the water in that puddle was my own tears, and my woeful lamentations made ripples on it-- SAVVA That's not quite so, Kondraty.","You were singing a song: ""And we're baptized of him in Jordan""--to a very jolly tune at that.",KONDRATY You don't say!,What of it?,So much the worse.,It shows to what depths a man will descend.,"SAVVA Don't assume a melancholy air, father.","You're quite a jovial fellow by nature, and the assumption of grief doesn't go well with your face, I assure you.","KONDRATY True, Savva Yegorovich, I was a jolly fellow; but that was before I entered the monastery.","As soon as I came here I took a tumble, so to speak; I lost my joviality and serenity and learned to know what real sorrow is.",_[Tony enters and remains standing in the doorway gazing ecstatically at the monk._ SAVVA Why so?,KONDRATY _(stepping nearer and speaking in a lowered voice)_ There is no God here--there's only the devil.,"This is a terrible place to live in, on my word it is, Mr. Savva.",I am a man with a large experience.,It's no easy thing to frighten me.,But I am afraid to walk in the hall at night.,SAVVA What devil?,KONDRATY The ordinary one.,"To you, educated people, he appears in a nobler aspect of course; but to us plain, simple people, he reveals himself as he really is.",SAVVA With horns?,KONDRATY How can I tell?,"I never saw the horns; but that's not the point, although I may say that his shadow clearly shows the horns.",The thing is that we have no peace in our monastery; there is always such a noise and clatter there.,Everything is quiet outside; but inside there are groans and gnashing of teeth.,"Some groan, some whine, and some complain about something, you can't tell what.","When you pass the doors, you feel as if your soul were taking leave of the world behind every door.",Suddenly something glides from around the corner.--and there's a shadow on the wall.,Nothing at all--and yet there's a shadow on the wall.,In other places it makes no difference.,"You pay no attention to such a trifle as a shadow; but here, Savva Yegorovich, they are alive, and you can almost hear them speak.",On my word of honor!,"Our hall, you know, is so long that it seems never to end.",You enter--nothing!,"You see a sort of black object moving in front of you, something like the figure of a man.","Then it stretches out, grows larger and larger and wider and wider until it reaches across the ceiling, and then it's behind you!",You keep on walking.,Your senses become paralyzed.,You lose all consciousness.,SAVVA _(to Tony)_ What are you staring at?,TONY What a face!,KONDRATY And God too is impotent here.,"Of course we have sacred relics and a wonder-working ikon; but, if you'll excuse me for saying so, they have no efficacy.",LIPA What are you saying?,KONDRATY None whatever.,"If you don't believe me, ask the other monks.",They'll bear me out.,"We pray and pray, and beat our foreheads, and the result is nothing, absolutely nothing.",If the image did nothing else than drive away the impure power!,But it can't do even that.,"It hangs there as if it were none of its business, and as soon as night comes, the stir and the gliding and the flitting around the corners begin again.","The abbot says we are cowards, poor in spirit, and that we ought to be ashamed.",But why are the images ineffective?,The monks in the monastery say-- LIPA Well?,KONDRATY But it's hard to believe it.,It's impossible.,They say that the devil stole the real image long ago--the one that could perform miracles--and hung up his own picture instead.,"LIPA Oh, God, what blasphemy!","Why aren't you ashamed to believe such vile, horrid stuff?",You who are wearing a monk's robe at that!,You really ought to be lying in a puddle--it's the proper place for you.,"SAVVA Now, now, don't get mad.","Don't mind her, Father Kondraty, she doesn't mean it.",She is a good girl.,"But really, why don't you leave the monastery?",Why do you want to be fooling about here with shadows and devils?,KONDRATY _(shrugging his shoulders)_ I would like to leave; but where am I to go?,I dropped work long ago.,I am not used to it any more.,Here at least I don't have to worry about how to get a piece of bread.,And as for the devil _(cautiously winking to Savva as he turns to the window and fillips his neck with his fingers)_ I have a means against him.,"SAVVA Well, let's go out and have a talk.","You, face, will you send us some whiskey?",TONY _(gloomily)_ He isn't telling the truth.,There are no devils either.,The devil couldn't have hung up his picture if there's no devil.,It's impossible.,He had better ask me.,"SAVVA All right, we'll speak about that later.",Send us whiskey.,TONY _(goes)_ I won't send you any whiskey either.,SAVVA What a stupid fellow!,"I tell you what, father.",You go out into the garden through that door.,"I'll be, with you in a moment.",Don't lose yourself.,"_(He goes out after Tony)_ KONDRATY Good-bye, Miss Olympiada.",_[Lipa doesn't answer.,"When Kondraty has left, she walks around the room a few times, agitated, waiting for Savva._ SAVVA _(entering)_ Well, what a fool!",LIPA _(barring his way)_ I know why you came here.,I know!,Don't you dare!,SAVVA What's that?,"LIPA When I heard you talk, I thought it was just words, but now--Come to your senses!",Think!,You've gone crazy.,What do you mean to do?,SAVVA Let me go.,LIPA I listened to you and laughed!,Good Lord!,I feel as if I had awakened from a terrible dream.,Or is it all a dream?,What was the monk here for?,What for?,SAVVA Now that will do.,You have had your say; that's enough.,Let me go.,LIPA Don't you see you have gone crazy?,Do you understand?,You are out of your mind.,SAVVA I'm sick of hearing you repeat that.,Let's go.,"LIPA Savva; dear, darling Savva--No?","Very well, you won't listen to me?",Very well.,"You'll see, Savva, you'll see.",You ought to have your hands and feet tied.,"And you _will_ be bound, too.",There are people who will do it.,"Oh, God!",What does this mean?,Stay!,Stay!,Savva!,"SAVVA _(going)_ All right, all right.",LIPA _(shouting)_ I'll denounce you.,Murderer!,Ruffian!,I'll denounce you.,SAVVA _(turning round)_ Oho!,You had better be more careful.,"_(Puts his hand on her shoulder and looks into her eyes)_ You had better be more careful, I say.","LIPA You--_(For about three seconds there is a struggle between the two pairs of eyes, after which Lipa turns aside, biting her lips)_ I am not afraid of you.",SAVVA That's better.,But don't shout.,One should never shout.,_(Exit)_ LIPA _(alone)_ What does this mean?,What am I to do?,_(The hens cluck)_ YEGOR TROPININ _(in the door)_ What's the matter?,What's the row here--hey?,"I was gone just half an hour, and everything has gone topsy-turvy.","Lipa, why did you let the chickens get into the raspberry bushes?","Go and drive 'em away, damn you!","I am talking to you--yes, to you!","Go, or I'll go you, I'll go you, I'll-- CURTAIN THE SECOND ACT _Within the enclosure of the monastery.","In the rear, at the left, appear the monastery buildings, the refectory, monks' cells, parts of the church and the steeple, all connected by passageways with arched gates.",Board-walks run in different directions in the court.,At the right the corner of the steeple wall is seen slightly jutting out.,"Nestling against it is a small monastic cemetery surrounded by a light, grilled iron fence.",Marble monuments and slabs of stone and iron are sunk deep into the earth.,All are old and twisted.,It is a long time since anyone was buried there.,The cemetery contains also some wild rose-bushes and two or three rather small trees.,"It is evening, after vespers.",Long shadows are falling from the tower and the walls.,The monastery and the steeple are bathed in the reddish light of the setting sun.,"Monks, novices and pilgrims pass along the board-walks.","In the beginning of the act may be heard behind the scenes the driving of a village herd, the cracking of a herdsman's whip, the bleating of sheep, the lowing of cattle, and dull cries.","Toward the end of the act it grows much darker, and the movement in the yard ceases almost entirely.","Savva, Speransky, and the Young Friar are seated on a bench by the iron fence.","Speransky is holding his hat on his knees, and now and then he strokes his long, straight hair, which is hanging in two mournful strands over his long, pale face.","He holds his legs together speaks in a low, sad tone, and gesticulates with extended forefinger.","The Friar, young, round-faced, and vigorous, pays no attention to the conversation, but is smiling continually, as if at his own thoughts._ SAVVA _(preoccupied, looking aside)_ Yes.",What kind of work do you do here?,"SPERANSKY None at all, Mr. Savva.",How can a man in my condition do any work?,"Once a man begins to doubt his own existence, the obligation to work naturally ceases to exist for him.",But the deacon's wife does not understand it.,"She is a very stupid woman, utterly lacking in education, and, moreover, of an unlovely, cruel disposition.",She insists on making me work.,But you can imagine the sort of work I do under the circumstances.,"You see, the situation is this.",I have a splendid appetite.,That appetite began to develop while I was yet a student in the seminary.,"Now this deaconess, if you please, makes a fuss about every piece of bread I eat.","She doesn't understand, the ignorant woman, the possibility of the non-existence of this piece of bread.","If I had a real existence like the rest of you, I should feel very bad, but in my present condition her attacks don't affect me in the least.","Nothing affects me, Mr. Savva, nothing in the wide world.","SAVVA _(smiling at the Friar's unconscious joy, but still preoccupied)_ How long have you been in this condition?",SPERANSKY It began in the seminary while I was studying philosophy.,"It is a dreadful condition, Mr. Savva.","I have grown somewhat accustomed to it now, but at first it was unendurable.","I tried to hang myself once, and they cut me down.","Then I tried a second time, and they cut me down again.",Then they turned me out of the seminary.,"""Go hang yourself in some other place, you madman,"" they said.",As if there were any other place!,As if all places were not the same!,"THE FRIAR Mr. Savva, let's go fishing to-morrow at the mill.",SAVVA I don't like fishing.,It bores me.,FRIAR I'm sorry.,"Well then, let's go into the woods and knock down the dry branches of trees.",It's fine sport to walk about in the forest and knock off the branches with a stick.,"And when you shout ""Ho-ho-ho!""","the echo from the ravine answers back ""Ho-ho-ho!""",Do you like swimming?,"SAVVA Yes, I like it.",I am a good swimmer.,FRIAR I like it too.,"SPERANSKY _(with a deep sigh)_ Yes, it's a strange condition.",SAVVA _(smiling at the Friar)_ Eh?,"Well, how are you now?","SPERANSKY When my uncle took me to his house, he made me promise I would never attempt suicide again.",That was the only condition oh which he would consent to let me live with him.,"""All right,"" I said; ""if we really exist, then I won't make any further attempt to hang myself.""",SAVVA Why do you want to know whether you exist or not?,There is the sky.,"Look, how beautiful it is.",There are the swallows and the sweet-scented grass.,It's fine!,"_(To the Friar)_ Fine, isn't it, Vassya?","FRIAR Mr. Savva, do you like to tear up ant-hills?",SAVVA I don't know.,I never tried.,FRIAR I like it.,Do you like to fly kites?,SAVVA It's a long time since I tried to.,I used to like it very much.,SPERANSKY _(patiently awaiting the end of their conversation)_ Swallows!,What good is their flying to me?,"Anyhow, maybe swallows don't exist either, and it's all a dream.",SAVVA Suppose it is a dream.,"Dreams are very beautiful sometimes, you know.","SPERANSKY I should like to wake up, but I can't.","I wander around and wander around until I am weary and feeble, and when I rouse myself I find I am here, in the very same place.","There is the monastery and the belfry, and the clock strikes the hour.","And it's all like a dream, a fantasy.","You close your eyes, and it does not exist.","You open them, and it's there again.","Sometimes I go out into the fields at night and close my eyes, and then it seems to me there is nothing at all existing.","Suddenly the quail begin to call, and a wagon rolls down the road.",Again a dream.,"For if you stopped up your ears, you wouldn't hear those sounds.","When I die, everything will grow silent, and then it will be true.","Only the dead know the truth, Mr. Savva.","FRIAR _(smiling, cautiously waving his hands at a bird; in a whisper)_ It's time to go to bed, time to go to bed.",SAVVA _(impatiently)_ What dead?,"Listen, my dear sir.","I have a plain, simple, peasant mind, and I don't understand those subtleties.",What dead are you talking about?,"SPERANSKY About all the dead, every one without exception.",That's why the faces of the dead are so serene.,"Whatever agonies a man may have suffered before his death, the moment he dies his face becomes serene.",That's because he has learned the truth.,I always come here to attend the funerals.,It's astonishing.,There was a woman buried here.,She had died of grief because her husband was crushed under a locomotive.,You can imagine what must have been going on in her mind before her death.,It's too horrible to think of.,"Yet she lay there, in the coffin, absolutely serene and calm.","That's because she had come to know that her grief was nothing but a dream, a mere phantom.","I like the dead, Mr. Savva.",I think the dead really exist.,SAVVA I don't like the dead.,_(Impatiently)_ You are a very disagreeable fellow.,Has anybody ever told you that?,"SPERANSKY Yes, I have, heard it before.",SAVVA I would never have taken you out of the noose.,What damn fool did it anyway?,"SPERANSKY The first time it was the Father Steward, the next time my classmates.","I am very sorry you disapprove of me, Mr. Tropinin.","As you are an educated man, I should have liked to show you a bit of writing I did while I was in the seminary.","It's called ""The Tramp of Death.""",It's a sort of story.,"SAVVA No, spare me, please.",Altogether I wish you'd-- FRIAR.,_(rising)_ There comes Father Kirill.,I had better beat it.,SAVVA Why?,"FRIAR He came across me in the forest the other day when I was-shouting ""Ho!","Ho!""","""Ah,"" said he, ""you forest sprite with goat's feet!""","To-morrow after dinner, all right?","_(Walks away, sedately at first, but then with a sort of dancing step)_ FAT MONK _(approaches)_ Well, young men, having a pleasant chat?",Are you Mr. Tropinin's son?,SAVVA I am the man.,FAT MONK I have heard about you.,"A decent, respectable gentleman your father is.",May I sit down?,"_(He sits down)_ The sun has set, yet it's still hot.",I wonder if we'll have a storm to-night.,"Well, young man, how do you like it here?",How does this place compare with the metropolis?,SAVVA It's a rich monastery.,"FAT MONK Yes, thank the Lord.",It's celebrated all over Russia.,There are many who come here even from Siberia.,Its fame reaches far.,"There'll soon be a feast-day, and-- SPERANSKY You'll work yourself sick, father.",Services day and night.,"FAT MONK Yes, we must do our best for the monastery.",SAVVA Not for the people?,"FAT MONK Yes, for the people too.",For whom else?,Last year a large number of epileptics were cured; quite a lot of them.,"One blind man had his eyesight restored, and two paralytics were made to walk.","You'll see for yourself, young man, and then you won't smile.",I have heard that you are an unbeliever.,SAVVA You have heard correctly.,I am an unbeliever.,"FAT MONK It's a shame, a shame.","Of course, there are many unbelievers nowadays among the educated classes.",But are they any happier on that account?,I doubt it.,"SAVVA No, there are not so many.",They think they are unbelievers because they don't go to church.,"As a matter of fact, they have greater faith than you.",It's more deep-seated.,FAT MONK Is that so?,"SAVVA Yes, yes.","The form of their faith is, of course, more refined.","They are cultured, you see.","FAT MONK Of course, of course.","People feel better, feel more confident and secure, if they believe.",SAVVA They say the devil is choking

night.,Have you heard about it?,"_(The two monks laugh good-naturedly as they look at each other)_ GRAY MONK Some of the monks can't sleep well because they have overeaten, so they think they are being choked.","Why, young man, the devil can't enter within our sacred precincts.",SAVVA But suppose he does suddenly put in an appearance?,"What will, you do then?","FAT MONK We'll get after him

majority in silence, though now and then suppressed, indistinct talking may be heard.","Starting from somewhere far off to the left, the sound of the footsteps and the talking, muffled at first, approaches and grows louder, until at times it seems to fill the whole room.",Then it dies away in the distance again.,"The impression is that of some tremendous movement, elemental and irrepressible.","At the table, lighted only by a flickering stump of a tallow candle, sit Speransky and Tony.",The latter is very drunk.,"Cucumbers, herring, and bottles of whiskey are on the

the road is a hilly elevation covered with trampled grass.,It is between five and six in the morning.,The sun is out.,The mist over the meadow is scattering slowly.,Now and then a pilgrim or group of

is evidently moved by some joyous emotion.,"No individual voices are heard, but it is as if one could feel the singing of the blind, the cries, and the quick, glad snatches of conversation.",The general effect is that of an elemental force.,"The noise decreases at regular intervals, like a wave, and then the singing of the blind becomes distinctly audible.","Lipa and the Young Friar appear on the near side of the road: Lipa is sitting on the hillock, dressed as she was the night before, but her head is covered with a white scarf carelessly tied.",She is exhausted with joy and almost dropping off to sleep.,The Friar stands near her.,"On his face there is a troubled, vacant look.",His movements are irresolute and aimless.,"He tries to smile, but his smile is twisted and

me.,He should have come.,LIPA Did he tell you anything?,FRIAR _(waving his hand)_ He should have come.,"Yes, he should have come.","LIPA Ah, Vassya, Vassya, on account of your woods you missed one of

ikon?",FRIAR What about it?,Nothing.,"It's there in its place, and our people are praying to it.","LIPA Oh, Lord!",And the glass is whole too?,FRIAR The glass is whole too.,"LIPA That's what they told me, but I can't believe it yet.","Forgive me, O Lord!","Well, what are they doing?","They are overjoyed, I suppose.","FRIAR Yes, they are overjoyed.",They act as if they were drunk.,You can't make out what they are saying.,"A miracle, a miracle.","Father Kirill keeps grunting like a pig ""Oui, oui, oui.""",They put cold compresses on his head.,"He is fat, and he may pass out any moment.","No, I

it's a miracle.",All their lives these people have been waiting for a miracle.,"Perhaps they had already begun to despair, and now--O Lord!",It's enough to make you mad with joy.,"Yesterday, when I heard the cry of ""a miracle,"" I thought: ""No, it's impossible.","How could it happen?""","But then I saw them crying, crossing themselves, and going down on their knees.",And the ringing of the alarm bell stopped.,"FRIAR Oh, it was Afanassy who rang.","He's terribly strong, a regular giant.","LIPA And the only thing heard was ""A miracle, a miracle!""","No one spoke, and yet one kept hearing

will do!,"Oh, my!",LIPA I have only one hope--that he has understood at last.,"But if-- FRIAR Well, what's the ""if""?","LIPA Oh, nothing, but--When he came here, it was as if a cloud had passed

approaching.",_[Lipa looks at him in astonishment.,The Friar presses his hand to his bosom in a state of agitation._ FRIAR _(plaintively)_ What are you saying?,"Oh, God!",Why did you say that?,You mustn't do it.,"This is no tramp of death, nothing of the kind.","SAVVA It's a kind of story he has written--Good morning, good morning.",What can I do for you?,"SPERANSKY Mr. Anthony Tropinin is looking for you, Mr. Savva.",SAVVA What do you want?,"TONY _(very sadly, hiding a little behind Speransky)_ Nothing.","FRIAR _(listening attentively and then speaking with passion)_ What are you

the Friar he fixes his gaze on Savva)_ Savva.,SAVVA _(irritated)_ What do you want?,"_[Tony makes no answer, but hides behind Speransky, looking over his shoulder.",In the course of what follows he keeps steadily looking at Savva.,"His lips and eyebrows twitch, and at times he presses both his hands hard against his mouth._ SPERANSKY The crowd is in a state of great agitation, Miss Olympiada.",They broke the old gate opening on the other side of the woods and rushed in.,The Father Superior came out and asked them to behave.,They shout so you can't hear anything at all.,Many are rolling on the ground in convulsions.,I suppose they are sick.,"It's very strange, quite unusual in fact.",LIPA Will they carry Him out soon?,I must go.,_(Rises)_ SPERANSKY They say it'll be soon

road coming from the monastery.,"He is walking in the company of two pilgrims, who are listening attentively to him.","Catching sight of Savva, Kondraty says something to his companions, who remain standing where they are while he goes up to Savva._ SAVVA Aha!","KONDRATY _(clean, spruce, beaming)_ Good morning, Miss Olympiada.","Good morning to you too, Mr. Savva Tropinin.","SAVVA Good morning,

hands.",SAVVA What bravery!,And how clean you are!,You are positively painful to look at.,You didn't make quite so smart an appearance when you lay wallowing in the puddle.,"You were a little the worse for the mud, and so on.",KONDRATY _(shrugging his shoulders and speaking with dignity)_ It's no use recalling that incident now.,It's quite out of place.,"Mr. Tropinin, it's time for you to have done with your spite and malice, high time.",SAVVA Well?,KONDRATY That's all.,"There is no ""well"" about it.",You have had your shot.,Be satisfied.,SAVVA Are congratulations upon the miracle in

beyond my power.,The brothers sobbed and wept.,Not one of them was able to sing.,The little candles burned with tiny little flames.,"And then when we carried Him out to the gate, and when we began to think and remembered--who is now in His sacred place--we lay around the ikon, our faces on the ground, and cried and wept bitter, bitter tears, tears of pity and contrition.","""O Thou, our own, our precious idol, have mercy on us, return to Thy place.""",_(Lipa cries; the Friar wipes his eyes with his fist)_ And then--bang!,"went the machine, and the sulphurous smoke spread all around so that it was impossible to breathe.","_(In a whisper)_ And then many beheld the devil in the smoke, and they were so terrified that they lost consciousness.",It was horrible!,"And then, as we carried Him back, all of one accord, as though we had agreed beforehand, began to sing ""Christ is arisen.""",That's how it happened.,"SAVVA You hear, Lipa?",But what's the matter with you?,Why are you all crying?,"FRIAR It makes one feel so sorry, Mr. Savva.","SAVVA Why, they fooled you, they played a trick on you.","Or else you are all lying, lying with your tears.","_[Kondraty makes a gesture of indifference._ LIPA _(shaking her head, weeping)_ No, Savva, you don't understand.","Oh, Lord!","Oh, Lord!","KONDRATY You have no God, that's the reason you don't understand; You have only reason, and pride, and malice.",That's why you don't understand.,"Ah, Mr. Savva, you wanted to ruin me too.",And I tell you as a Christian--it would have been better if you had never been born.,"SAVVA Oh,

brother, consider a moment.",Didn't they carry the ikon away?,Then where is the miracle?,"KONDRATY _(twisting himself free from Savva's grasp, shaking his head and speaking aloud)_ Then you don't understand?","No, you don't understand.",What of it?,"SAVVA _(in a whisper)_ Listen, remember our talk.",KONDRATY _(aloud)_ Don't whisper to me.,I have nothing to hide from anybody.,How do you think

SOMEONE IN GRAY CALLED HE, SPEAKING OF THE LIFE OF MAN _A large, rectangular space resembling a room without doors or windows and quite empty.","Everything is gray, monocolored, drab--the watts gray, and the ceiling, and the floor.","A feeble, even light enters from some invisible source.","It too is gray, monotonous, spectral, producing neither lights nor shadows.","Someone in Gray moves noiselessly away from the wall, close against which He has been standing.","He wears a broad, gray, formless smock, vaguely outlining the contours of His body; and a hat of the same gray throws the upper part of His face into heavy shadow.",His eyes are invisible.,"All that is seen are His cheekbones, His nose, and His chin, which is massive, heavy, and blunt, as if hewn out of rock.",His lips are pressed tight together.,"Raising His head slightly, He begins to speak in a firm, cold, unemotional, unimpassioned voice, like a reader hired by the hour reading the Book of Fate with brutal indifference._ SOMEONE IN GRAY Look and listen, you who have come here to laugh and be amused.","There will pass before you the whole life of Man, from his dark beginning to his dark ending.","Previously non-existant, mysteriously hidden in the infiniteness of time, neither feeling nor thinking and known to no one, he will mysteriously break through the prison of non-being and with a cry announce the beginning of his brief life.","In the night of non-existence a light will go up, kindled by an unseen hand.",It is the life of Man.,Behold the flame--it is the life of Man.,"Being born, he will take the form and the name of Man, and in all things will become like other men already living.","And their hard lot will be his lot, and his hard lot will be the lot of all human beings.","Inexorably impelled by time, he will, with inavertible necessity, pass through all the stages of human life, from the bottom to the top, from the top to the bottom.","Limited in vision, he will never see the next step which his unsteady foot, poised in the air, is in the very act of taking.","Limited in knowledge, he will never know what the coming day will bring, or the coming hour, or the coming minute.","In his unseeing blindness, troubled by premonitions, agitated by hope and fear, he will submissively complete the iron-traced circle foreordained.",Behold him a happy youth.,See how brightly the candle burns.,"From boundless stretches of space the icy wind blows, circling, careering, and tossing the flame.",In vain.,Bright and clear the candle burns.,"Yet the wax is dwindling, consumed by the fire.",Yet the wax is dwindling.,Behold him a happy husband and father.,"But see how strangely dim and faint the candle burns, as if the yellowing flame were wrinkling, as if it were shivering with cold and were creeping into concealment.","The wax is melting, consumed by the fire.",The wax is melting.,"Behold him, an old man, ill and feeble.",The stages of life are already ended.,In their stead nothing but a black void.,Yet he drags on with palsied limbs.,"The flame, now turned blue, bends to the ground and crawls along, trembling and falling, trembling and falling.",Then it goes out quietly.,Thus Man will die.,"Coming from the night, he will return to the night and go out, leaving no trace behind.","He will pass into the infinity of time, neither thinking nor feeling, and known to no one.","And I, whom all call He, shall remain the faithful companion of Man throughout his life, on all his pathways.","Unseen by him, I shall be constantly at hand when he wakes and when he sleeps, when he prays and when he curses.","In his hours of joy, when his spirit, free and bold, rises aloft; in his hours of grief and despair, when his soul clouds over with mortal pain and sorrow, and the blood congeals in his heart; in the hours of victory and defeat; in the hours of great strife with the immutable, I shall be with him--I shall be with him.","And you who have come here to be amused, you who are consecrated to death, look and listen.","There will pass before you, like a distant phantom echo, the fleet-moving life of Man with its sorrows and its joys.",_[Someone in Gray turns silent.,"The light goes out, and He and the gray, empty room are enveloped in darkness._ THE FIRST SCENE THE BIRTH OF MAN AND THE MOTHER'S TRAVAIL

don't get killed by stones thrown at them.,"--Poor woman, she has such a hard time giving birth to her child.","We have been sitting here sixteen hours, and she is still crying.",At first she cried out loud.,Her screams pierced our ears.,"Then she cried more quietly, and now she is only moaning.",--The doctor says she'll die.,"--No, the doctor says the child will die and she will live.",--Why do they bear children?,It is so painful.,--And why do they die?,It is still more painful.,"_[The Old Women laugh suppressedly._ --Yes, they bear children and die.",--And bear children again.,_[They laugh.,A subdued cry of the suffering woman is heard._ --Beginning again.,--She's recovered her voice.,That's good.,--That's good.,--Poor husband.,He's lost his head completely.,You ought to see him.,He's a sight.,At first he was glad his wife was pregnant and said he wanted a boy.,He thinks his son will be a cabinet minister or a general.,"Now he doesn't want anything, neither a boy nor a girl.",He just goes about grieving and crying.,"--Every time she is seized with pain he begins to labor, too, and gets red in the face.","--He was sent to the chemist's shop for medicine, and he hung about there for two hours without being able to remember what he was sent for.",He returned without it.,_[The Old Women titter.,The cries grow louder and die away.,Silence._ --What's the matter with her?,Maybe she has died already.,--No.,"If she had, we'd hear crying, and the doctor would come running and begin to talk nonsense.","They'd bring her husband out in a faint, and we'd have to work over him.","No, she's not dead.",--Then what are we sitting here for?,--Ask Him.,What do we know?,--He won't tell.,--He won't tell.,He never tells anything.,"--He orders us about as he pleases, gets us out of bed, and makes us watch; and then it turns out that our coming wasn't even needed.","--We came of our own accord, didn't we?",We must tell the truth.,"There, she's screaming again.",--Haven't you had as much of it as you want?,--Are you satisfied?,--I keep my mouth shut and wait.,--You're an angel.,_[They laugh.,The cries grow louder._ --Listen to her.,What fearful pain

recognize our friend's voice.,It's naturally so soft and gentle.,--Her screaming is more like the roar of a wild beast.,--You feel the night in it.,--You feel the boundless black forest and hopelessness and terror.,--You feel solitude and grief.,There are other people with her.,"Why can't you hear other voices beside that savage, dismal wail?","--They are talking, but you can't hear them.",Have you ever noticed how solitary man's cries are?,"Any number of men will talk, and you won't hear them.","But let one human being cry, and it seems as if the others were all silent, listening.",--I once heard a man scream who had been run over by a Carriage and had his leg crushed.,The street was full of people.,Yet he seemed to be the only one there.,--But this is more terrible.,--Say rather it is louder.,--I should say it is more prolonged.,"--No, it's more terrible.",You feel death in it.,"--You had a feeling of death then, too.","In fact, the man did die.",--Don't dispute.,It's all the same to you.,_[Silence.,Cries._ --How strange man's crying is!,"When you yourself are ill and cry, you don't notice how strange it is.",I can't imagine the mouth that produces such sounds.,Can it be a woman's mouth?,I can't imagine it.,--It's as if it got twisted and crooked.,--As if the sound issued from some depth.,Now it's like the cry of someone drowning.,"Listen, she's choking.",--A heavy person is sitting on her chest.,--Someone is choking her.,_[The crying ceases._ --At last she has quieted down.,You get tired of crying.,It's monotonous and not beautiful.,"--You're looking for beauty here too, are you?",_[The Old Women titter._ --Hush!,Is He here?,--I don't know.,--He seems to be.,--He doesn't like laughing.,--They say He laughs

what she pleases.,"_(Silence)_ --When they are born, they are so funny.",Babies are very funny.,--And self-satisfied.,"--And very exacting, I don't like them.","They begin to cry at once and make demands, as if they expected everything to be ready for them.","Even before looking, they know there is a breast and milk, and demand them.",Then they demand to be put to sleep and rocked and dandled and patted on their red backs.,I like them better when they die.,Then they're less exacting.,They stretch out of themselves and don't ask to be rocked.,"--No, they are very funny.",I like to wash them when they are born.,--I like to wash them when they are dead.,--Don't dispute.,Don't dispute.,Each will have her way.,"One will wash the child when it is born, another when it dies.",--But why do they think they have a right to make demands the moment they are born?,I don't like it.,They don't _think_ they have.,It's their stomachs that make the demands.,--They're forever demanding.,--But their

in the huge fireplace.",It is such a tremendous fireplace that it will hold a whole log.,It will burn up a whole forest of pines.,WIFE How nice and warm.,"MAN And how quiet too, if you will please notice.","Carpets covering the whole, floor and lots of books will make it cosy and quietly lively.","And we'll be there, the two of us.",The wind howling outside and we two sitting before the fireplace on a white bear-skin rug.,"""Wouldn't you like to have a look at what's doing outside?""",you'll say.,"""All right!""",And we'll go to the largest window and draw aside the curtain.,Good heavens!,What a sight!,WIFE See the snow whirling.,"MAN Galloping like white horses, like myriads of frightened little spirits, pale with fear and seeking safety in the night.",And what a howling and roaring!,"WIFE Oh, it's cold.",I'm shivering.,"MAN Go back to the fireplace, quick!","Hey there, fetch me grandfather's goblet--not that one, the golden one from which the vikings drank.",Fill it up with sparkling wine--not that way--fill it to the brim with the burning draught.,Venison is roasting on the spit.,Bring it here.,I'll eat some.,"Quick, or I'll eat you.",I'm hungry as the devil.,"WIFE There, they have brought it.","Now, go on.",MAN Go on?,"I'll eat some, of course.",What else do you expect?,"What are you doing to my head, little wife?",WIFE I am the goddess of fame.,"I have woven a crown of the oak leaves that our neighbors scattered here, and I'm crowning you.","It's Fame that has come to you, the beautiful goddess Fame.","_(Puts the wreath on his head)_ MAN Yes, fame; loud, noisy fame.",Look at the wall.,Do you see this?,"It's I, walking.",And who is this next to me?,Do you see?,WIFE I.,"MAN Look, they are bowing to us; they are whispering about us; they are pointing their fingers at us.","There is a venerable old gentleman saying with tears in his eyes: ""Happy the land that has such children!""",See how pale this youth here has turned.,Fame looked at him and gave him a smile.,"That's after I built the People's House, which is the pride of the whole country.",WIFE You are my famous husband.,The oak wreath suits you so well.,A laurel wreath would become you still better.,"MAN Look, look, there come the representatives of the city where I was born.","They bow to me and say: ""Our city is proud of the honor--"" WIFE Oh!",MAN What is it?,WIFE I found a bottle of milk.,MAN Impossible!,"WIFE And bread, soft, sweet-smelling bread.",And a cigar.,MAN Impossible!,You are mistaken.,"It's the dampness from that damned wall, that's what it is.",It isn't milk.,WIFE But it is.,MAN A cigar?,Cigars don't grow on windows.,They are sold for fortunes in tobacco stores.,"It's a black stick, a piece of a branch, I'm sure.",WIFE Look and see.,I suppose our neighbors brought it.,MAN Our neighbors?,I tell you they're people--they're not human--they're divine.,"But even if the devil himself brought it--quick, give it here, my sweet little wife.","_[Man's Wife seats herself on his knees, and so they eat.",She breaks off pieces of bread and puts them in his mouth.,He feeds her the milk from the bottle._ MAN Seems to be cream.,"WIFE No, it's milk.",Chew better.,You'll choke.,MAN.,Give me the crust.,It's so brown.,"WIFE I told you, you'd choke.","MAN No, it went down.",I swallowed it.,WIFE The milk is running down my chin and neck.,"Oh, it's tickling me.",MAN.,Lean over.,I'll lick it off.,We mustn't let a drop go to waste.,WIFE You're a cunning one.,MAN There!,Quick work.,All good things soon come to an end.,This bottle seems to have a double bottom.,It looks so large.,The glass manufacturers are terrible cheats.,_[He lights the cigar with the air of a man relaxing into beatific repose.,"His Wife ties the red ribbon in her hair, looking at herself in the dark pane of the window._ WIFE Don't you see?",MAN I see everything.,"I see your ribbon, and I see, you want me to kiss you on your dear little bare neck.",WIFE.,"No, sir, I won't permit that.",You've grown too forward of late anyway.,You take such liberties.,"Please go on smoking your cigar and leave my neck-- MAN What, isn't your neck mine?",I'll be jiggered!,"Why, it's an attack on the sacred rights of property _(She runs away; he catches her and kisses her)_ So, the property rights have been restored.","Now, my dear, we'll dance.","Imagine that this is a magnificent, a luxurious, a wonderful, a supernatural, ah exquisitely beautiful palace.",WIFE Very well.,I'm imagining it.,MAN Imagine you're the queen of the ball.,WIFE All right.,It is imagined.,"MAN And that counts, marquises, and dukes come up and ask you to dance.",But you refuse.,You choose that one--What's his name?--the one in uniform--the prince.,What's the matter?,WIFE I don't like princes.,MAN Indeed?,Then whom do you like?,WIFE Talented artists.,MAN Very well.,Here's one for you.,"Why, girl, what are you doing?",Are you flirting with the air?,WIFE I am imagining.,MAN All right.,Imagine a wonderful orchestra.,"Here is the Turkish drum--boom, boom, boom!","_(He strikes his fist on the table as on a drum)_ WIFE Why, dear, it's only in the circus that they attract crowds by beating drums, but in a palace-- MAN Oh, hang it!","Stop imagining that, then.",Now imagine something else.,The violins are playing a melodious plaint; the flutes are singing gently; the double bass drones like a beetle.,"_[Man sits down, still wearing his oak wreath, and strikes up a dance tune, clapping his hands in accompaniment.",The melody is the same as in the next scene at Man's ball.,The Wife dances.,"She is well-formed and graceful._ MAN Oh, you darling!",WIFE I am the queen of the ball.,_[The song and dance grow ever jollier.,Man rises slowly and begins to dance lightly on the spot where he is standing; then he seizes his Wife and dances with her.,The oak wreath slips to one side.,"Someone in Gray looks on indifferently, the candle burning brightly in his petrified hand._ CURTAIN THE THIRD SCENE A BALL AT MAN'S HOUSE _The ball is in the drawing-room of Man's large mansion.","It is a very lofty, spacious, perfectly rectangular room.",The floor is bright and smooth.,There is a certain irregularity about the room due to the disproportionate size of the parts.,"Thus, the doors are very small in proportion to the windows.","This produces a strange, irritating impression, as of something disharmonious, something lacking, and also of something superfluous and adventitious.","The whole is pervaded by a chilly white, the monotony of which is broken only by a row of windows in the rear wall.","They are very high, reaching almost to the ceiling, and dense with the blackness of night.","Not one gleam, not a bright spot shows in the blank spaces between the window frames.",Man's wealth shows in the abundance of gildings.,"There are gilded chairs, and very wide gold frames enclose the pictures.",These constitute the only furniture as well as the only ornamentation.,"The lighting is from three chandeliers shaped like tings, with a few electric lights placed at a great distance apart."
