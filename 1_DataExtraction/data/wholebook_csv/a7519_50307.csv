Let us try the axe again.,This is to Laura singing (Quando Amor).,"As I look across the bay, there is seen resting over all the hills, and even upon every distant sail, an enchanted veil of palest blue, that seems woven out of the very souls of happy days,--a bridal veil, with which the sunshine weds this soft landscape in summer.","Such and so indescribable is the atmospheric film that hangs over these poems of Petrarch's; there is a delicate haze about the words, that vanishes when you touch them, and reappears as you recede.","How it clings, for instance, round this sonnet (Aura che quelle chiome)!",Consider also the pure and reverential tenderness of one like this (Qual donna attende).,"A companion sonnet, on the other hand (O passi sparsi), seems rather to be of the Shakespearean type; the successive phrases set sail, one by one, like a yacht squadron; each spreads its graceful wings and glides away.",It is hard to handle this white canvas without soiling.,"Macgregor, in the only version of this sonnet which I have seen, abandons all attempt at rhyme; but to follow the strict order of the original in this respect is a part of the pleasant problem which one cannot bear to forgo.","And there seems a kind of deity who presides over this union of languages, and who sometimes silently lays the words in order, after all one's poor attempts have failed.","Yonder flies a kingfisher, and pauses, fluttering like a butterfly in the air, then dives toward a fish, and, failing, perches on the projecting wall.","Doves from neighboring dove-cots alight on the parapet of the fort, fearless of the quiet cattle who find there a breezy pasture.","These doves, in taking flight, do not rise from the ground at once, but, edging themselves closer to the brink, with a caution almost ludicrous in such airy things, thrust themselves upon the breeze with a shy little hop, and at the next moment are securely on the wing.",How the abundant sunlight inundates everything!,"The great clumps of grass and clover are imbedded in it to the roots; it flows in among their stalks, like water; the lilac-bushes bask in it eagerly; the topmost leaves of the birches are burnished.","A vessel sails by with plash and roar, and all the white spray along her side is sparkling with sunlight.","Yet there is sorrow in the world, and it reached Petrarch even before Laura died,--when it reached her.",One exquisite sonnet (I' vidi in terra) shows this to have been true.,These sonnets are in Petrarch's earlier manner; but the death of Laura brought a change.,"Look at yonder schooner coming down the bay straight toward us; she is hauled close to the wind, her jib is white in the sunlight, her larger sails are touched with the same snowy lustre, and all the swelling canvas is rounded into such lines of beauty as scarcely anything else in the world--hardly even the perfect outlines of the human form--can give.","Now she comes up into the wind, and goes about with a strong flapping of her sails, smiting on the ear at a half-mile's distance; then she glides off on the other tack, showing the shadowed side of her sails, until she reaches the distant zone of haze.","So change the sonnets after Laura's death, growing shadowy as they recede, until the very last (Gli occhi di ch'io parlai) seems to merge itself in the blue distance.","""And yet I live!""",(Ed io pur vivo) What a pause is implied before these words with which the closing sestet of this sonnet begins!,the drawing of a long breathy immeasurably long; like that vast interval of heart-beats which precedes Shakespeare's 'Since Cleopatra died.',I can think of no other passage in literature that has in it the same wide spaces of emotion.,"Another sonnet (Soleasi nel mio cor) which is still more retrospective, seems to me the most stately and concentrated in the whole volume.",It is the sublimity of a despair not to be relieved by utterance.,In a later strain (Levommi il mio pensier) he rises to that dream which is more than earth's realities.,"It vindicates the emphatic reality and personality of Petrarch's love, after all, that when from these heights of vision he surveys and resurveys his life's long dream, it becomes to him more and more definite, as well as more poetic, and is farther and farther from a merely vague sentimentalism.","In his later sonnets, Laura grows more distinctly individual to us; her traits show themselves as more characteristic, her temperament more intelligible, her precise influence upon Petrarch clearer.","What delicate accuracy of delineation is seen, for instance, in the sonnet (Dolci durezze)!",In the sonnet (Gli angeli eletti) visions multiply upon visions.,"Would that one could transfer into English the delicious way in which the sweet Italian rhymes recur and surround and seem to embrace each other, and are woven and unwoven and interwoven, like the heavenly hosts that gathered around Laura.","Petrarch's odes and sonnets are but parts of one symphony, leading us through a passion strengthened by years and only purified by death, until at last the graceful lay becomes an anthem and a 'Nunc dimittis.'","In the closing sonnets Petrarch withdraws from the world, and they seem like voices from a cloister, growing more and more solemn till the door is closed.",This is one of the last (Dicemi spesso).,How true is its concluding line!,"Who can wonder that women prize beauty, and are intoxicated by their own fascinations, when these fragile gifts are yet strong enough to outlast all the memories of statesmanship and war?",Next to the immortality of genius is that which genius may confer upon the object of its love.,"Laura, while she lived, was simply one of a hundred or a thousand beautiful and gracious Italian women; she had her loves and aversions, joys and griefs; she cared dutifully for her household, and embroidered the veil which Petrarch loved; her memory appeared as fleeting and unsubstantial as that of woven tissue.",After five centuries we find that no armor of that iron age was so enduring.,"The kings whom she honored, the popes whom she revered are dust, and their memory is dust, but literature is still fragrant with her name.",An impression which has endured so long is ineffaceable; it is an earthly immortality.,"""Time is the chariot of all ages to carry men away, and beauty cannot bribe this charioteer.""","Thus wrote Petrarch in his Latin essays; but his love had wealth that proved resistless, and for Laura the chariot stayed.","SONNETS      I      Lieti fiori e felici, e ben nate erbe,      Che Madonna, pensando, premer sole;      Piaggia ch'ascolti sue dolci parole,      E del bel piede alcun vestigio serbe;

mia fiamma non impari.,"I      O joyous, blossoming, ever-blessed flowers!","'Mid which my pensive queen her footstep sets;      O plain, that hold'st her words for amulets      And keep'st her footsteps in thy leafy bowers!","O trees, with earliest green of springtime hours,      And all spring's pale and tender violets!","O grove, so dark the proud sun only lets      His blithe rays gild the outskirts of thy towers!",O pleasant country-side!,"O limpid stream,      That mirrorest her sweet face, her eyes so clear,      And of their living light canst catch the beam!",I envy thee her presence pure and dear.,There is no rock so senseless but I deem      It burns with passion that to mine is near.,"II      Quando Amor i begli occhi a terra inchina      E i vaghi spirti in un sospiro accoglie      Con le sue mani, e poi in voce gli scioglie      Chiara, soave, angelica, divina;      Sento far del mio cor dolce rapina,      E sì dentro cangiar pensieri e voglie,      Ch'i' dico: or fien di me l'ultime spoglie,      Se 'l Ciel sì onesta morte mi destina.","Ma 'l suon, che di dolcezza i sensi lega,      Col gran desir d'udendo esser beata,      L'anima, al dipartir presta, raffrena.","Così mi vivo, e così avvolge e spiega      Lo stame della vita che m'è data,      Questa sola fra noi del ciel sirena.","II      When Love doth those sweet eyes to earth incline,      And weaves those wandering notes into a sigh      With his own touch, and leads a minstrelsy      Clear-voiced and pure, angelic and divine,--      He makes sweet havoc in this heart of mine,      And to my thoughts brings transformation high,      So that I say, ""My time has come to die,      If fate so blest a death for me design.""","But to my soul, thus steeped in joy, the sound      Brings such a wish to keep that present heaven,      It holds my spirit back to earth as well.",And thus I live: and thus is loosed and wound      The thread of life which unto me was given      By this sole Siren who with us doth dwell.,"III      Aura che quelle chiome bionde e crespe      Circondi e movi, e se' mossa da loro      Soavemente, e spargi quel dolce oro,      E poi 'l raccogli e 'n bei nodi 'l rincrespe;      Tu stai negli occhi ond'amorose vespe      Mi pungon sì, che 'nfin qua il sento e ploro;      E vacillando cerco il mio tesoro,      Com'animal che spesso adombre e 'ncespe:      Ch'or mel par ritrovar, ed or m'accorgo      Ch'i' ne son lunge; or mi sollevo, or caggio:      Ch'or quel ch'i' bramo, or quel ch'è vero, scorgo.","Aer felice, col bel vivo raggio      Rimanti.","E tu, corrente e chiaro gorgo,      Ché non poss'io cangiar teco viaggio?","III      Sweet air, that circlest round those radiant tresses,      And floatest, mingled with them, fold on fold,      Deliciously, and scatterest that fine gold,      Then twinest it again, my heart's dear jesses;      Thou lingerest on those eyes, whose beauty presses      Stings in my heart that all its life exhaust,      Till I go wandering round my treasure lost,      Like some scared creature whom the night distresses.","I seem to find her now, and now perceive      How far away she is; now rise, now fall;      Now what I wish, now what is true, believe.",O happy air!,"since joys enrich thee all,      Rest thee; and thou, O stream too bright to grieve!",Why can I not float with thee at thy call?,"IV      Qual donna attende a gloriosa fama      Di senno, di valor, di cortesia,      Miri fiso negli occhi a quella mia      Nemica, che mia donna il mondo chiama.","Come s'acquista onor, come Dio s'ama,      Com'è giunta onestà con leggiadria,      Ivi s'impara, e qual è dritta via      Di gir al Ciel, che lei aspetta e brama.","Ivi 'l parlar che nullo stile agguaglia,      E 'l bel

and pure devotion's flame,      How truth is joined with graceful dignity,      There thou mayst learn, and what the path may be      To that high heaven which doth her spirit claim;      There learn that speech, beyond all poet's skill,      And sacred silence, and those holy ways      Unutterable, untold by human heart.","But the infinite beauty that all eyes doth fill,      This none can learn!","because its lovely rays      Are given by God's pure grace, and not by art.","V      O passi sparsi, o pensier vaghi e pronti,      O tenace memoria, o fero ardore,      O possente desire, o

life!,"delusion sweet and dire,      That all my days from slothful rest redeems;      O beauteous face!","where Love has treasured well      His whip and spur, the sluggish heart to move      At his least will; nor can it find relief.",O souls of love and passion!,"if ye dwell      Yet on this earth, and ye, great Shades of Love!","Linger, and see my passion and my grief.","VI      I' vidi in terra angelici costumi      E celesti bellezze al mondo sole;      Tal che di rimembrar mi giova e dole;      Ché quant'io miro par sogni, ombre e fumi.","E vidi lagrimar que' duo bei lumi,      C'han fatto mille volle invidia al Sole;      Ed udii sospirando dir parole      Che farian gir i monti e stare i fiumi.","Amor, senno, valor, pietate e doglia      Facean piangendo un più dolce concento      D'ogni altro che nel mondo udir si soglia:      Ed era 'l cielo all'armonia sì 'ntento,      Che non si vedea 'n ramo mover foglia;      Tanta dolcezza avea pien l'aere e 'l vento.","VI      I once beheld on earth celestial graces      And heavenly beauties scarce to mortals known,      Whose memory yields nor joy nor grief alone,      But all things else in cloud and dreams effaces.","I saw how tears had left their weary traces      Within those eyes that once the sun outshone,      I heard those lips, in low and plaintive moan,      Breathe words to stir the mountains from their places.","Love, wisdom, courage, tenderness, and truth      Made in their mourning strains more high and dear      Than ever wove soft sounds for mortal ear;      And heaven seemed listening in such saddest ruth      The very leaves upon the bough to soothe,      Such sweetness filled the blissful atmosphere.","VII      Gli occhi di ch'io parlai sì caldamente,      E le braccia e le mani e i piedi e 'l viso      Che m'avean sì da me stesso diviso      E fatto singular dall'altra gente;      Le crespe chiome d'or puro lucente,      E 'l lampeggiar dell'angelico riso      Che solean far in terra un paradiso,      Poca polvere son, che nulla sente.","Ed io pur vivo; onde mi doglio e sdegno,      Rimaso senza 'l lume ch'amai tanto,      In gran fortuna e 'n disarmato legno.","Or sia qui fine al mio amoroso canto:      Secca è la vena dell'usato ingegno,      E la cetera mia rivolta in pianto.","VII      Those eyes, 'neath which my passionate rapture rose,      The arms, hands, feet, the beauty that erewhile      Could my own soul from its own self beguile,      And in a separate world of dreams enclose,      The hair's bright tresses, full of golden glows,      And the soft lightning of the angelic smile      That changed this earth to some celestial isle,--      Are now but dust, poor dust, that nothing knows.",And yet I live!,"Myself I grieve and scorn,      Left dark without the light I loved in vain,      Adrift in tempest on a bark forlorn;      Dead is the source of all my amorous strain,      Dry is the channel of my thoughts outworn,      And my sad harp can sound but notes of pain.","VIII      Soleasi nel mio cor star bella e viva,      Com'alta donna in loco umile e basso:      Or son fatt'io per l'ultimo suo passo,      Non pur mortal ma morto; ed ella

breath.",Assuredly but dust and shade we are;      Assuredly desire is mad and blind;      Assuredly its hope but ends in death.,"IX      Levommi il mio pensier in parte ov'era      Quella ch'io cerco

dwells whom here I seek, but cannot see.","'Mid those who in the loftiest heaven be      I looked on her, less haughty and more fair.","She took my hand, she said, ""Within this sphere,      If hope deceive not, thou shalt dwell with me:      I filled thy life with war's wild agony;      Mine own day closed ere evening could appear.","My bliss no human thought can understand;      I wait for thee alone, and that fair veil      Of beauty thou dost love shall yet retain.""","Why was she silent then, why dropped my hand      Ere those delicious tones could quite avail      To bid my mortal soul in heaven remain?","X      Dolci durezze e placide repulse,      Piene di casto amore e di pietate;      Leggiadri sdegni, che le mie infiammate      Voglie tempraro (or me n'accorgo) e 'nsulse;      Gentil parlar, in cui chiaro refulse      Con somma cortesia somma onestate;      Fior di virtù, fontana di beltate,      Ch'ogni basso pensier del cor m'avulse;      Divino sguardo, da far l'uom felice,      Or fiero in affrenar la mente ardita      A quel che giustamente si disdice,      Or presto a confortar mia frale vita;      Questo bel variar fu la radice      Di mia salute, che altramente era ita.","X      Gentle severity, repulses mild,      Full of chaste love and pity sorrowing;      Graceful rebukes, that had the power to bring      Back to itself a heart by dreams beguiled;      A tender voice, whose accents undefiled      Held sweet restraints, all duty honoring;      The bloom of virtue; purity's clear spring      To cleanse away base thoughts and passions wild;      Divinest eyes to make a lover's bliss,      Whether to bridle in the wayward mind      Lest its wild wanderings should the pathway miss,      Or else its griefs to soothe, its wounds to bind;      This sweet completeness of thy life it is      Which saved my soul; no other peace I find.","XI      Gli angeli eletti e l'anime beate      Cittadine del cielo, il primo giorno      Che
