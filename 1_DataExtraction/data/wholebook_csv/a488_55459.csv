possibly, however, they may derive sustenance, even from that partial mode of communication.","The height of a full-grown Banian may be from sixty to eighty feet; and many of them, I am fully confident, cover at least two acres.","Their leaves are similar to, but rather larger than those of the laurel.","The wood of the trunk is used only for fuel; it is light and brittle; but the pillars formed by the roots are valuable, being extremely elastic and light, working with ease, and possessing great toughness: it resembles a good kind of ash.--_Oriental Field Sports_, vol.",ii.,p. 113.,"{143}   ----_The Well_   _Which they, with sacrifice of rural pride,_   _Have wedded to the Cocoa-Grove beside._--XIII.",p. 5.,"It is a general practice, that, when a plantation is made, a well should be dug at one of its sides.","The well and the tope are married;

which they do by casting up great banks in convenient places, to stop and contain the rains that fall, and so save it till they have occasion to let it out into the fields: They are made rounding, like a C, or half-moon.","Every town has one of these ponds, which, if they can get but filled with water, they count their corn is as good as in the barn.","It was no small work to the ancient inhabitants to make all these banks, of which there is a great number, being some two, some three fathoms in height, and in length some above a mile, some {145} less, not all of a size.","They are now grown over with great trees, and so seem natural hills.","When they would use the water, they cut a gap in one end of the bank, and so draw the water by little and little, as they have occasion, for the watering their corn.","These ponds, in dry weather, dry up quite.","If they should dig these ponds deep, it would not be so convenient for them.","It would indeed contain the water well, but would not so well, nor in such plenty, empty out itself into their grounds.","In these ponds are alligators, which, when the water is dried up, depart into the woods, and down to the rivers, and, in the time of rains, come up again into the ponds.","They are but small, nor do use to catch people, nevertheless they stand in some fear of them.","The corn they sow in these parts is of that sort that is soonest ripe, fearing lest their waters should fail.","As the water dries out of these ponds, they make use of them for fields, treading the mud with buffaloes, and then sowing rice thereon, and frequently casting up water with scoops on it.--KNOX, p. 9.",_The Lotus._--XIII.,p. 5.,"The lotus abounds in the numerous lakes and ponds of the province of Garah; and we had the pleasure of comparing {146} several varieties; single and full, white, and tinged with deep or with faint tints of red.","To a near view, the simple elegance of the white lotus gains no accession of beauty from the multiplication of its petals, nor from the tinge of gaudy hue;

fifty or sixty labourers completed it in that time, and on emergency could perform the work in much less.","Bamboos, grass for thatching, and the ground rattan, are all the materials requisite: not a nail is used in the whole edifice: A row of strong bamboos, from eight to ten feet high, are fixed firm in the ground, which describe the outline, and are the supporters of the building: smaller bamboos are then tied horizontally, by strips of the ground rattan, to these upright posts: {147} The walls, composed of bamboo mats, are fastened to the sides with similar ligatures: bamboo rafters are quickly raised, and a roof formed, over which thatch is spread in regular layers, and bound to the roof by filaments of rattan.","A floor of bamboo grating is next laid in the inside, elevated two or three feet above the ground: this grating is supported on bamboos, and covered with mats and carpets.","Thus ends the process, which is not more simple than effectual.","When the workmen take pains, a house of this sort is proof against very inclement weather.","We experienced, during our stay at Meeday, a severe storm of wind and rain, but no water penetrated, nor thatch escaped: and if the tempest should blow down the house, the inhabitants would run no risk of having, their brains knocked out, or their bones broken;

otherwise they are precipitated into _Nark_, and doomed to be born again in the bodies of unclean beasts; and until, by repeated {149} regenerations, all their sins are done away, and they attain such a degree of perfection as will entitle them to what is called _Mooktee_, eternal salvation, by which is understood a release from future transmigration, and an absorption in the nature of the godhead, who is called Brahm.--WILKINS.",_Note to the Bhagvat Geeta_.,"The divine names are always pleased with an oblation in empty glades, naturally clean, on the banks of rivers, and in solitary spots.--_Inst.",of Menu_.,_Voomdavee._--XIII.,p. 7.,This wife of Veeshnoo is the Goddess of the Earth and of Patience.,No direct adoration is paid her;

that he governed a numerous race of elephants; and that the odoriferous fluid which exuded from his temples in the season of love had formed the river; that the Devas, or inferior gods, and the Apsarases, or nymphs, bathed and sported in its waters, impassioned and intoxicated with the liquid perfume.--WILFORD.",_Asiatic Researches_.,"_The antic monkeys, whose wild gambols late_   _Shook the whole wood._--XIII.",p. 10.,"They are so numerous on the island of Bulama, says Captain Beaver in his excellent book, that I have seen, on a calm evening, when there was not an air sufficiently strong to agitate a leaf, the whole surrounding wood {152} in as much motion, from their playful gambols among its branches, as if it had blown a strong wind.",_Not that in emulous skill that sweetest bird_   _Her rival strain would try._--XIII.,p. 10.,"I have been assured, by a credible eye-witness, that two wild antelopes used often to come from their woods to the place where a more savage beast, Sirajuddaulah, entertained himself with concerts, and that they listened to the strains with an appearance of pleasure, till the monster, in whose soul there was no music, shot one of them, to display his archery.","A learned native of this country told me that he had frequently seen the most venomous and malignant snakes leave their holes, upon hearing tunes on a flute, which, as he supposed, gave them peculiar delight.","An intelligent Persian, who repeated his story again and again, and permitted me to write it down from his lips, declared, he had more than once been present when a celebrated lutanist, _Mirza Mohammed_, surnamed _Bulbul_, was playing to a large company, in a grove near _Shiraz_, where he distinctly saw the nightingales trying to vie with the musician;

some get broken arms, some broken legs; so that many of them are so destroyed, and by this means they think to merit heaven.--BRUTON.",_Churchill's Collection_.,"They sometimes lie down in the track of this machine a few hours before its arrival, and, taking a soporiferous draught, hope to meet death asleep.--CLAUDIUS BUCHANAN.",_A harlot-band._--XIV.,p. 19.,"There are in India common women, called Wives of the Idol.","When a woman has made a vow to obtain children, if she brings into the world a beautiful daughter, she carries her to _Bod_, so their idol is called, with whom she leaves her.","This girl, when she is arrived at a proper age, takes an apartment in the public place, hangs a curtain before the door, and waits for those who are passing, as well Indians as those of other sects among whom this debauchery is permitted.","She prostitutes {162} herself for a certain price, and all that she can thus acquire she carries to the priest of the idol, that he may apply it to the service of the temple.","Let us, says the Mohammedan relater, bless the almighty and glorious God, that he has chosen us, to exempt us from all the crimes into which men are led by their unbelief.--_Anciennes Relations_.","Incited, unquestionably, says Mr. Maurice, by the hieroglyphic emblem of vice so conspicuously elevated, and so strikingly painted in the temples of Mahadeo, the priests of that deity industriously selected the most beautiful females that could be found, and, in their tenderest years, with great pomp and solemnity, consecrated them (as it is impiously called) to the service of the presiding divinity of the pagoda.","They were trained up in every art to delude and to delight; and, to the fascination of external beauty, their artful betrayers added the attractions arising from mental accomplishments.","Thus was an invariable rule of the Hindoos, _that women have no concern with literature_, dispensed with upon this infamous occasion.","The moment these hapless victims reached maturity, they fell victims to the lust of the Brahmins.","They were early taught to practise the most alluring blandishments, to roll the expressive eye of wanton pleasure, and to invite to criminal indulgence, by {163} stealing upon the beholder the tender look of voluptuous languishing.","They were instructed to mould their elegant and airy forms into the most enticing attitudes and the most lascivious gestures, while the rapid and graceful motion of their feet, adorned with golden bells, and glittering with jewels, kept unison with the exquisite melody of their voices.","Every pagoda has a band of these young syrens, whose business, on great festivals, is to dance in public before the idol, to sing hymns in his honour, and in private to enrich the treasury of that pagoda with the wages of prostitution.","These women are not, however, regarded in a dishonourable light; they are considered as _wedded to the idol_, and they partake of the veneration paid to him.","They are forbidden even to desert the pagoda where they are educated, and are never permitted to marry; but the offspring, if any, of their criminal embraces are considered as sacred to the idol: the boys are taught to play on the sacred instruments used at the festivals, and the daughters are devoted to the abandoned occupations of their mothers.--_Indian Antiquities_.","These impostors take a young maid, of the fairest they can meet with, to be the bride, (as they speak and bear the besotted people in hand) of _Jagannat_, and they leave her all night in the temple (whither they {164} have carried her) with the idol, making her believe that _Jagannat_ himself will come and embrace her, and appointing her to ask him, whether it will be a fruitful year, what kind of processions, feasts, prayers, and alms he demands to be made for it.","In the mean time one of these lustful priests enters at night by a little back-door into the temple, deflowereth this young maid, and maketh her believe any thing he pleaseth; and the next day, being transported from this temple into another with the same magnificence, she was carried before upon the chariot of triumph, on the side of _Jagannat_ her bridegroom: these _Brahmans_ make her say aloud, before all the people, whatsoever she had been taught of these cheats, as if she had learnt it from the very mouth of _Jagannat._--BERNIER.",_Baly._--XV.,p. 26.,"The fifth incarnation was in a Bramin dwarf, under the name of Vamen; it was wrought to restrain the pride of the giant Baly.","The latter, after having conquered the gods, expelled them from Sorgon; he was generous, true to his word, compassionate, and charitable.","Vichenou, under the form of a very little Bramin, presented himself before him while he was sacrificing, and asked him for three paces of land to build a hut.","Baly ridiculed the {165} apparent imbecility of the dwarf, in telling him, that he ought not to limit his demand to a bequest so trifling; that his generosity could bestow a much larger donation of land.","Vamen answered, That, being of so small a stature, what he asked was more than sufficient.","The prince immediately granted his request, and, to ratify his donation, poured water into his right hand; which was no sooner done than the dwarf grew so prodigiously, that his body filled the universe!","He measured the earth with one pace, and the heavens with another, and then summoned Baly to give him his word for the third.","The prince then recognised Vichenou, adored him, and presented his head to him; but the god, satisfied with his submission, sent him to govern the Padalon, and permitted him to return every year to the earth, the day of the full moon, in the month of November.--SONNERAT's _Voyages_, vol.",i. p. 24.,_The sacred cord._--XV.,p. 30.,"The Brahmans who officiate at the temples generally go with their heads uncovered, and the upper part of the body naked.","The _Zennar_, or sacred string, is hung round the body from the left shoulder;

but those of the Sodra cast are excluded from this distinction, none of them being permitted to wear it.--CRAUFURD.",_The City of Baly._--XV.,p. 31.,"Ruins of Malâbalipûr, the City of the great Baly.","A rock, or rather hill of stone, is that which first engrosses the attention on approaching the place; for as it rises abruptly out of a level plain of great extent, consists chiefly of one single stone, and is situated very near to the sea-beach, it is such a kind of object as an inquisitive traveller would naturally turn aside to examine.","Its shape is also singular and romantic, and, from a distant view, has an appearance like some antique and lofty edifice.","On coming near to the foot of the rock from the north, works of imagery and sculpture crowd so thick upon the eye, as might seem to favour the idea of {167} a petrified town, like those that have been fabled in different parts of the world, by too credulous travellers.","Proceeding on by the foot of the hill, on the side facing the sea, there is a pagoda rising out of the ground, of one solid stone, about sixteen or eighteen feet high, which seems to have been cut upon the spot, out of a detached rock, that has been found of a proper size for that purpose.","The top is arched, and the style of architecture according to which it is formed different from any now used in those parts.","A little further on, there appears, upon a huge surface of stone, that juts out a little from the side of the hill, a numerous group of human figures, in bass-relief, considerably larger than life, representing the most remarkable persons whose actions are celebrated in the Nahâbharit, each of them in an attitude, or with weapons, or other insignia, expressive of his character, or of some one of his most famous exploits.","All these figures are doubtless much less distinct than they were at first; for upon comparing these and the rest of the sculptures that are exposed to the sea-air, with others at the same place, whose situation has afforded them protection from that element, the difference is striking; the former being every where much defaced, while the others are fresh as recently finished.","An excavation in another part of the east side of the great rock appears {168} to have been made on the same plan, and for the same purpose, that Chowltries are usually built in that country, that is to say, for the accommodation of travellers.","The rock is hollowed out to the size of a spacious room, and two or three rows of pillars are left, as a seeming support to the mountainous mass of stone which forms the roof.","The ascent of the hill on the north is, from its natural shape, gradual and easy at first, and is in other parts rendered more so, by very excellent steps, cut out in several places where the communication would be difficult or impracticable without them.","A winding stair of this sort leads to a kind of temple cut out of the solid rock, with some figures of idols in high relief upon the walls, very well finished.","From this temple there are flights of steps, that seem to have led to some edifice formerly standing upon the hill; nor does it seem absurd to suppose that this may have been a palace, to which this temple may have appertained; for, besides the small detached range of stairs that are here and there cut in the rock, and seem as if they had once led to different parts of one great building, there appear in many places small water channels cut also in the rock, as if for drains to an house; and the whole top of the hill is strewed with small round pieces of brick, which may be supposed, {169} from their appearance, to have been worn down to their present form during the lapse of many ages.","On a plain surface of the rock, which may once have served as the floor of some apartment, there is a platform of stone, about 8 or 9 feet long, by 3 or 4 wide, in a situation rather elevated, with two or three steps leading up to it, perfectly resembling a couch or bed, and a lion very well executed at the upper end of it, by way of pillow; the whole of one piece, being part of the hill itself.","This the Bramins, inhabitants of the place, call the bed of Dhermarâjah, or Judishter, the eldest of the five brothers, whose exploits are the leading subject in the Mahabhârit.","And at a considerable distance from this, at such a distance, indeed, as the apartments of the women might be supposed to be from that of the men, is a bath, excavated also from the rock, with steps in the inside, which the Bramins call the Bath of Dropedy, the wife of Judishter and his brothers.","How much credit is due to this tradition, and whether this stone couch may not have been anciently used as a kind of throne, rather than a bed, is matter for future enquiry.","A circumstance, however, which may seem to favour this idea is, that a throne, in the Shanscrit and other Hindoo languages, is called _Singhâsen_, which is compounded of _Sing_, a lion, and _ásen_, a seat.","{170} But though these works may be deemed stupendous, they are surpassed by others that are to be seen at the distance of about a mile, or mile and half, to the south of the hill.","They consist of two pagodas, of about 30 feet long, by 20 feet wide, and about as many in height, cut out of the solid rock, and each consisting originally of one single stone.",Their form is different from the style of architecture according to which idol temples are now built in that country.,"These sculptures approach nearer to the Gothic taste, being surmounted by arched roofs, or domes, not semicircular, but composed of two segments of circles meeting in a point at top.","Near these also stand an elephant full as big as life, and a lion much larger than the natural size, both hewn also out of one stone.","The great rock is about 50 or 100 yards from the sea; but close to the sea are the remains of a pagoda built of brick, and dedicated to Sîb, the greatest part of which has evidently been swallowed up by that element; for the door of the innermost apartment, in which the idol is placed, and before which there are always two or three spacious courts surrounded with walls, is now washed by the waves, and the pillar used to discover the meridian at the time of founding the pagoda is seen standing at some distance in the sea.","In the neighbourhood of {171} this building there are some detached rocks, washed also by the waves, on which there appear sculptures, though now much worn and defaced: And the natives of the place declared to the writer of this account, that the more aged people among them remembered to have seen the tops of several pagodas far out in the sea, which, being covered with copper, (probably gilt,) were particularly visible at sun-rise, as their shining surface used then to reflect the sun's rays, but that now that effect was no longer produced, as the copper had since become incrusted with mould and verdigrease.--CHAMBERS.",_Asiatic Researches_.,"_Thou hast been called, O Sleep!","the friend of Woe,_   _But 'tis the happy who have call'd thee so._--XV.",p. 36.,"Daniel has a beautiful passage concerning Richard II.--sufficiently resembling this part of the poem to be inserted here:    To _Flint_, from thence, unto a restless bed,   That miserable night he comes convey'd;

and she and her sister nymph used thenceforward to have frequent interviews with him in that garden.","On one of those occasions they brought with them a male inhabitant of the heavenly regions, to whom they introduced the Rajah; and between him and Malecheren a strict friendship ensued; in consequence of which he agreed, at the Rajah's earnest request, to carry him in disguise to see the court of the divine Inder,--a favour never before granted to any mortal.","The Rajah returned from thence with new ideas of splendour and magnificence, which he immediately adopted in regulating his court and his retinue, and in beautifying his seat of government.","By this means Mahâbalipoor became soon celebrated beyond all the cities of the earth; and on account of its magnificence having been brought to the gods assembled at the court of Inder, their jealousy was so much excited at it, that they sent orders to the God of the Sea to let loose his billows, and overflow a place which impiously pretended to vie in splendour with their celestial mansions.","This {174} command he obeyed, and the city was at once overflowed by that furious element, nor has it ever since been able to rear its head.--CHAMBERS.",_Asiat.,Res._   _Round those strange waters they repair._--XVI.,p. 44.,"In the Bahia dos Artifices, which is between the river Jagoarive and S.

on, which the sage, greatly incensed at the designed affront, {177} scooped up some of the water in the hollow of his hand, and drank it off: he again and again repeated the draught, nor desisted till he had drained the bed of the ocean of the entire volume of its waters.","Alarmed at this effect of his holy indignation, and dreading an universal drought, the Devatas made intercession with Agastya to relent from his anger, and again restore an element so necessary to the existence of nature, both animate and inanimate.","Agastya, pacified, granted their request, and discharged the imbibed fluid in a way becoming the histories of a gross physical people to relate, but by no means proper for this page; away, however, that evinced his sovereign power, while it marked his ineffable contempt for the vain fury of an element, contending with a being armed with the delegated power of the Creator of all things.","After this miracle, the earth being, by the same power, restored to its just balance, Agastya and Veeshnu separated: when the latter, to prevent any similar accident occurring, commanded the _great serpent_ (that is, of the sphere) to wind its enormous folds round the seven continents, of which, according to Sanscreet geography, the earth consists, and appointed, as perpetual guardians, to watch over and protect it, the eight powerful genii, so renowned in the Hindoo system of mythology, as presiding over the eight points of the world.""--MAURICE.","{178} The Pauranics (said Ramachandra to Sir William Jones) will tell you that our earth is a plane figure studded with eight mountains, and surrounded by seven seas of milk, nectar, and other fluids;

but the spreading out of her wings and tail has no less compass than an eagle's.","She lives and breeds in the air, comes not near the earth but for her burial, for the largeness and lightness of her wings and tail sustain her without lassitude.","And the laying of her eggs, and breeding of her young, is upon the back of the male, which is made hollow, as also the breast of the female, for the more easy incubation.","Also two strings, like two shoemaker's ends, come from the hinder parts of the male, wherewith it is conceived that he is fastened closer to the female, while she hatches her eggs on the hollow of {184} his back.","The dew of heaven is appointed her for food, her region being too far removed from the approach of flies and such like insects.","This is the entire story and philosophy of this miraculous bird in _Cardan_, who professes himself to have seen it no less than thrice, and to have described it accordingly.","The contrivances whereof, if the matter were certainly true, are as evident arguments of a Divine Providence, as that copper-ring, with the Greek[36] inscription upon it, was an undeniable monument of the artifice and finger of man.","But that the reproach of over-much credulity may not lie upon _Cardan_ alone, Scaliger, who lay at catch with him to take him tripping wherever he could, cavils not with any thing in the whole narration but the bigness of wings and the littleness of the body; which he undertakes to correct from one of his own which was sent him by _Orvesanus_ from Java.","Nay, he confirms what his antagonist has wrote, partly by history and partly by reason; affirming, that himself, in his own garden, found two {185} little birds with membranaceous wings utterly devoid of legs, their form was near to that of a bat's.","Nor is he deterred from the belief of the perpetual flying of the _Manucodiata_, by the gaping of the feathers of her wings, which seem thereby less fit to sustain her body, but further makes the narration probable by what he has observed in kites hovering in the air, as he saith, for a whole hour together without flapping of her wings, or changing place.","And he has found also how she may sleep in the air, from the example of fishes, which he has seen sleeping in the water without sinking themselves to the bottom, and without changing place, but lying stock still, _pinnulis tantum nescia quid motiuncule meditantes_, only wagging a little their fins, as heedlessly and unconcernedly as horses while they are asleep wag their ears to displace the flies that sit upon them.","Wherever Scaliger admitting that the Menucodiata is perpetually on the wing in the air, he must of necessity admit also that manner of incubation that Cardan describes, else how could their generations continue?","Franciscus Hernandeo affirms the same with Cardan expressly in every thing: As also Eusebius Nierembergius, who is so taken with the story of this bird, that he could not abstain from celebrating her miraculous properties in a short but elegant copy of verses; and does {186} after, though confidently opposed, assert the main matter again in prose.","Such are the sufferages of Cardan, Scaliger, Hernandeo, Nierembergius.","But Aldrovandus rejects that fable of her feeding on the dew of heaven, and of her incubiture on the back of the male, with much scorn and indignation.","And as for the former, his reasons are no ways contemptible, he alledging that dew is a body not perfectly enough mixed, or heterogenial enough for food, nor the hard bill of the bird made for such easie uses as sipping this soft moisture.","To which I know not what Cardan and the rest would answer, unless this, that they mean by dew the more unctuous moisture of the air, which as it may not be alike every where, so these birds may be fitted with a natural sagacity to find it out where it is.","That there is dew in this sense day and night, (as well as in the morning,) and in all seasons of the year; and therefore a constant supply of moisture and spirits to their perpetual flying, which they more copiously imbibe by reason of their exercise: That the thicker parts of this moisture stick and convert into flesh, and that the lightness of their feathers is so great, that their pains in sustaining themselves are not over-much.","That what is homogeneal and simple to our sight is fit enough to be the rudiments of generation, {187} all animals being generated of a kind of clear crystalline liquor; and that, therefore, it may be also of nutrition; that orpine and sea-house-leek are nourished and grow, being hung in the air, and that dock-weed has its root no deeper than near the upper parts of the water; and, lastly, that the bills of these birds are for their better flying, by cutting the way, and for better ornament; for the rectifying also and composing of their feathers, while they swim in the air with as much ease as swans do in river.","To his great impatiency against their manner of incubation, they would happily return this answer: That the way is not ridiculous; but it may be rather necessary from what Aldrovandus himself not only acknowledges but contends for, namely, that they have no feet at all.","For hence it is manifest, that they cannot light upon the ground, nor any where rest on their bellies, and be able to get on wing again, because they cannot creep out of holes of rocks, as swifts and such like short-footed birds can, they having no feet at all to creep with.","Besides, as Aristotle well argues concerning the long legs of certain water-fowl, that they were made so long, because they were to wade in the water and catch fish, adding that excellent aphorism, τὰ γαρ ὄργανα πρὸς τὸ ἔργον ἡ φύσις ποιεῖ ἀλλ᾽ ὐ τὸ ἔργον πρὸς τὰ ὄργανα, so may we rationally conclude, will they say, that as the long legs of these water-fowl {188} imply a design of their haunting the water, so want of legs in these Manucodiatas argue they are never to come down to the earth, because they can neither stand there nor get off again.","And if they never come on the earth, or any other resting-place, where can their eggs be laid or hatched but on the back of the male?","Besides that Cardan pleases himself with that Antiphonie in nature, that as the Ostrich being a bird, yet never flies in the air, and never rests upon the earth.","And as for Aldrovandus, his presumption from the five several Manucodiatas that he had seen, and in which he could observe no such figuration of parts as implied a fitness for such a manner of incubation, Cardan will answer, Myself has seen three, and Scaliger one, who both agree against you.","However, you see that both Cardan, Aldrovandus, and the rest do jointly agree in allowing the Manucodiata no feet, as also in furnishing her with two strings, hanging at the hinder parts of her body, which Aldrovandus will have to be in the female as well as in the male, though Cardan's experience reacheth not so far.","But Pighafetta and Clusius will easily end this grand controversy betwixt Cardan and Aldrovandus, if it be true which they report, and if they speak of the same kind of Birds of Paradise.","For they both affirm that they {189} have feet a palm long, and that with all confidence imaginable; but Nierembergius on the contrary affirms, that one that was an eye witness, and that had taken up one of these birds newly dead, told him that it had no feet at all.","Johnston also gives his suffrage with Nierembergius in this, though with Aldrovandus he rejects the manner of their incubation.","But unless they can raise themselves from the ground by the stiffness of some of the feathers of their wings, or rather by virtue of those nervous strings which they may have a power to stiffen when they are alive, by transfusing spirits into them, and making them serve as well instead of legs to raise them from the ground as to hang upon the boughs of trees, by a slight thing being able to raise or hold up their light-feathered bodies in the air, as a small twig will us in the water, I should rather incline to the testimony of Pighafetta and Clusius than to the judgment of the rest, and believe those mariners that told him that the legs are pulled off by them that take them, and extenterate them and dry them in the sun for either their private use or sale.","Which conclusion would the best solve the credit of Aristotle, who long since has so peremptorily pronounced ὄτι πτηνὸν μόνον ὐδὲν ἐσιν ὥσπερ νευσικὸν μόνον ἐσιν ὶχθὸς.",That there is not any bird that only flies as the fish only swims.,{190} But thus our Bird of Paradise is quite flown and vanished into a figment or fable.,"But if any one will condole the loss of so convincing an argument for a Providence that fits one thing to another, I must take the freedom to tell him, that, unless he be a greater admirer of novelty than a searcher into the indissoluble consequences of things, I shall supply his meditation with what of this nature is as strongly conclusive, and remind, that it will be his own reproach if he cannot spy as clear an inference from an ordinary truth as from either an uncertainty or a fiction.","And in this regard, the bringing this doubtful narration into play may not justly seem to no purpose, it carrying so serious and castigatory a piece of pleasantry with it.","The manucodiata's living on the dew is no part of the convictiveness of a Providence in this story: But the being excellently well provided of wings and feathers, _tanta levitatis supellectile exornata_, as Nierembergius speaks, being so well furnished with all advantages for lightness, that it seems harder for her to sink down, as he conceits, than to be borne up in the air; that a bird thus fitted for that region should have no legs to stand on the earth, this would be a considerable indication of a discriminating Providence, that on purpose avoids all uselessness and superfluities.","{191} The other remarkable, and it is a notorious one, is the cavity on the back of the male and in the breast of the female, for incubation; and the third and last, the use of those strings, as Cardan supposes, for the better keeping them together in incubiture.","If these considerations of this strange story strike so strongly upon thee as to convince thee of a Providence, think it humour and not judgment, if what I put in lieu of them, and is but ordinary, have not the same force with thee.","For is not the fish's wanting feet, (as we observed before,) she being sufficiently supplied with fins in so thick an element as the water, as great an argument for a Providence as so light a bird's wanting feet in that thinner element of the air, the extream lightness of her furniture being appropriated to the thinness of that element?","And is not the same Providence seen, and that as conspicuously, in allotting but very short legs to those birds that are called Apodeo both in Plinie and Aristotle, upon whom she has bestowed such large and strong wings, and a power of flying so long and swift, as in giving no legs at all to the manucodiata, who has still a greater power of wing and lightness of body?","And as for the cavities on the back of the male and in the breast of the female, is that design of nature any more {192} certain and plain than in the genital parts of the male and female in all kinds of animals?",What greater argument of counsel and purpose of fitting one thing for another can there be than that?
