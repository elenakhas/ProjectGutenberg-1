and, with one thing and another, the problem of how to satisfy champagne tastes on a beer income had never been really satisfactorily solved by Stan, poor old boy.","And he never, never grumbled at home, not even when the cold beef came on three evenings together, which was harder on him than it was on most people.","He did what he could to earn, too.","It wasn't his fault that the standard of efficiency in the Army was so impracticably high, nor that he had been packed off to try his luck in Canada with the disadvantage of being a remittance-man, nor that, at the age of twenty-seven, when his father had died, he had had to turn to and compete for this job or that with a horde of capable youngsters years his juniors and with fewer hampering decencies.","It was his father's fault and Aunt Susan's really, for having sent him to Marlborough and Sandhurst without being able to set him properly on his feet afterwards.","Such victims of circumstances, on a rather different level, made husbands who stopped at home and cleaned the knives and took the babies out in the perambulator.",In Stan's case the natural result had been to make a young man fit only to join as a ranker or to stand with his back to a mirror in a suspect card-room.,"""Shall I take him away, m'm?""","Mrs. Mossop asked--(""And prepare his winding-sheet,"" her tone seemed to add).","""Yes, do,"" Dorothy replied, with a glance at Ruth's blackened hands.","""And please make yourself fit to be seen, Ruth.","You know you oughtn't to be doing all that on the very day I let Norah out.""","She knew that her rebuke had set Ruth up in the melancholy enjoyment of resentment for half a week, but she was past caring.",Ruth rose an inch in height at being chidden for the faithful performance of her most disagreeable duties;

she must do something.,"She crossed to her writing-desk and took from one of its drawers a fat file, concertina-ed like her own accordion-pleated skirts; and she sat down and opened it fan-wise on her knee.","It was full of newspaper-cuttings, draft ""ideas"" for advertisements, and similar dreary things.",She sighed again as her listless fingers began to draw them out.,She had not thought at one time that she would ever come to this.,By a remarkable piece of luck and light-heartedness and ingenuity she had started at Hallowell and Smith's at the top of the tree; the brains of underlings had been good enough to cudgel for such scrap-stuff as filled her concertina-file; but that was all changed now.,"Light come, light go; and since the lapse of her contracts she had been glad not only to devise these ignoble lures for the public, but to draw them also.",They formed the pennies-three-farthings that came in while Stan carved the twopences from the joint.,She had thought the good times were going to last for ever.,They hadn't.,She now looked enviously up to those who had been her own subordinates.,"With no heart in her task at all, Dorothy set about the drafting of an advertisement.","She was just beginning to forget about swallowed safety-pins, and poor luckless Stan, and guineas for her Nursing Home, and the prospect of presently having seven mouths, big and little, to feed--she was even beginning to cease to hear the clamour of the Bits in the room along the passage--when there came a ring at the bell.","Her fair head did not move, but her blue eyes stole abstractedly sideways as Ruth passed the pond-room door.","Then a man's voice sounded, and Dorothy dropped her pen.... ""Mrs. Tasker,"" she had heard, with the ""a"" cut very short and two ""s's"" in her name....","The next moment Ruth had opened the pond-room door, and, in tones that plainly said ""You needn't think that I've forgotten about just now, because I haven't,"" announced: ""Mr.","Miller.""",Now it was curious that Dorothy had just been thinking about Mr. Miller.,"Mr. Miller was Hallowells' Publicity Manager, and the time had been when Dorothy had had Mr. Miller completely in her pocket.","She had obtained that comfortable contract of hers from Mr. Miller, and if during the latter part of its continuance she had taken her duties somewhat lightly and her pleasures with enormous gusto, she was not sure that Mr. Miller had not done something of the same kind.","But the firm, which could excuse itself from a renewal of her own contract, for some reason or other could not get rid of Mr. Miller; and now here was Mr. Miller unexpectedly in Dorothy's flat--seeking her, which is far better for you than when you have to do the seeking.",He stood there with his grey Trilby in his hand and his tailor-made deltoids almost filling the aperture of the doorway.,"""There, now, if I wasn't right!""","said Mr. Miller with great satisfaction, advancing with one hand outstretched.","""I fixed it all up with myself coming along that you'd be around the house.","I've had no luck all the week, and I said to myself as I got out of the el'vator at Belsize Park, 'It's doo to change.'","And here I find you, right on the spot.",I hope this is not an introosion.,How are you?,And how's Mr.,"Stan?""","He shook hands heartily with Dorothy, and looked round for a place in which to put his hat and stick.","""Why, now, this is comfortable,"" he went on, drawing up the chair to which Dorothy pointed.","""I like your English fires.","They may not have all the advantages of steam-heat, but they got a look about 'em--the Home-Idee.","And you're looking just about right in health, Mrs. Tasker, if I may say so.","You English women have our N'York ladies whipped when it comes to complexion, you have for sure.","And how's the family----?""",But here Mr. Miller suddenly stopped and looked at Dorothy again.,"If the look that came into his eyes had come into those of a young unmarried woman, Dorothy would have fled there and then.",He dropped his head for a moment as people do who enter a church; then he raised it again.,"""If you'll pardon an old married man and the father of three little goils,"" Mr. Miller said, his eyes reverently lifted and his voice suddenly altered, ""--but am I right in supposing that ... another little gift from the storks, as my dear old Mamie--that was my dear old negro nurse--used to say?""","Then, without waiting for the unrequired answer, he straightened his back and squared his deltoids in a way that would have made any of Holbein's portraits of Henry the Eighth look like that of a slender young man.","His voice dropped three whole tones, and again he showed Dorothy the little bald spot on the crown of his head.","""I'm glad.",I say I'm glad.,I'm vurry glad.,I rejoice.,And I should like to shake Mr. Stan by the hand.,"I should like to shake you by the hand too, Mrs.","Tasker.""","Then, when he had done so: ""It's the Mother-Idee.","The same, old-fashioned Idee, like our own mothers.",It makes one feel good.,Reverent.,I got no use for a young man but what he shows lats of reverence for his mother.,"The old Anglo-Saxon-Idee--reverence for motherhood....

And that was how it came about that the Indian policy of the ""Novum"" was left in the hands of Mr. Suwarree Prang.","Part II I THE PIGEON PAIR Amory had been at a great deal of trouble to gather all the opinions she could get about the education of her twins, Corin and Bonniebell; but it was not true, as an unkind visitor who had been once only to The Witan had said, that they were everybody's children.","Just because Amory had taken Katie Deedes' advice and had had their hair chopped off short at the nape like a Boutet de Monvel drawing--and had not disdained to accept the spelling-books which Dickie Lemesurier had given them (books in which the difficult abstraction of the letter ""A"" was visualized for their young eyes as ""Little Brown Brother,"" ""B"" as ""Tabby Cat,"" and so on)--and had listened to Mr. Brimby when he had said what a good thing it would be to devote an hour on Friday afternoons to the study of Altruism and Camaraderie--and, in a word, had not been too proud and egotistical to make use of a good suggestion wherever she found it--because she had done these things, it did not at all follow that she had shirked her duties.","If she did not influence them directly, having other things to do, she influenced those who did influence them, which came to the same thing.","She influenced the Wyrons, for example, and nobody could say that the Wyrons had not made a particularly careful study of children.","They had, and Walter had founded at least two Lectures directly on the twins and their education.","But the Wyrons, who had submitted to the indignity of marriage for the sake of the race, laboured and lectured under an obvious disadvantage; they had no children of their own.",And so Amory had to fill up the gaps in their experience for herself.,"Still, it was wonderful how frequently the Wyrons' excogitations and the things Amory had found out for herself coincided.","They were in absolute accord, for example, about the promise of the immediate future and the hope that lay in the generation to come.",The Past was dead and damned; the Present at best was an ignoble compromise; but the Morrow was to be bright and shining.,"""Walter and I,"" Laura sometimes said sadly, ""aren't anything to brag about.",There is much of the base in us.,Our lives aren't what they should be.,We're in the grip of inherited instincts too.,"We strive for the best, but the worst's sometimes too much for us.",It's like Moses seeing the Promised Land from afar.,We're just in the position of Moses.,"But these young Aarons----"" Amory thought that very modest and dignified of poor old Laura.","She frequently thought of her as 'poor old Laura,' but of course she didn't mean her actual age, which was only two years more than Amory's own.","And that was very good, if a little sad, about Moses.",The Wyrons did look forth over a Canaan they weren't very likely ever to tread.,"Lately--that is to say since that secret and tremendous moment between herself and Edgar Strong in the studio--Amory had fallen into the habit of musing long over the sight of the twins at lessons, at play, or at that more enlightened combination that makes lessons play and play lessons.","Sometimes Mr. Brimby, the novelist, had come up to her as she had mused and had asked her what she was thinking about.","""Your little Pigeon Pair, eh?""",he had said.,"""Ah, the sweetness; ah, lucky mother!","Grey books have to be the children of some of us; ah, me; yours is a pleasanter path!""",Then he would fondle the little round topiary trees of their heads.,Amory was almost as sorry for Mr. Brimby as she was for Laura.,"His books sold only moderately well, and she had more than once thought she would like the ""Novum"" to serialize one of them--the one with the little boy rather like Corin and the little girl rather like Bonniebell in it--if Mr. Brimby didn't want too much money for it.","Edgar Strong, on the other hand, never fondled the children, and Amory's heart told her why.",How could he be expected to do anything but hate those poor innocents who had come between him and his desire?,He must have realized that only the twins had frustrated that flight to Paris.,Of course he was polite about it; he said that he was not very fond of children at all; but Amory was not deceived.,"She was, in a way, flattered that he did not fondle them.",It was such an eloquent abstention.,But it would have been more eloquent still had he come to The Witan and not-fondled them oftener.,"Therefore it was that Amory looked on Corin and Bonniebell as the precious repositories of her own relinquished joys, and heirs to a happier life than she herself had known.",She dreamed over them and their future.,Laura Wyron was quite right: by the time they had grown up the fogs of cowardice and prejudice and self-seeking would have disappeared for ever.,"Perhaps even by that time, as in Heaven, there would be no more marrying nor giving in marriage.",Things would have adjusted themselves out of the rarer and sweeter and more liberal atmosphere.,"Corin, grown to be twenty, would one day meet with some mite who was still in her cradle or not yet born, and the two would look at one another with amazement and delight, and the Ideal Love would be born in their eyes, and Corin would recite a few of those brave and pure and unashamed things out of ""Leaves of Grass"" to her, and--well, and there they would be.... And Bonniebell, too, would do the same, on a Spring morning very likely, simply clad, cool and without immodest blushes--yes, she too would see somebody, and she would say, gladly and simply, ""I am here"" (for there would be no reason, then, why she should wait for the youth to speak first), and--well, and there they would be too.","And it would be Exogamy, or whatever the word was that Walter used.","Either would go forth from the family on the appointed day--or perhaps only Corin would go, and Bonniebell remain behind--but anyway, one, if not both of them would go forth, and rove the morning-flushed hills, alone and free and singing and on the look-out for somebody, and they would look just like pictures of young Greeks, and nobody would laugh, as they did at the poor lady who walked in Greek robes down the Strand.... And Amory herself?",Alas!,She would be left with the tribe.,She would be old then--say fifty-something on the eleventh of October.,And Edgar would be old too.,They would have to recognize that _their_ youth had been spent in the night-time of ignorance and suspicion.,"_They_ would only be able to think of those spirited young things quoting ""Leaves of Grass"" to one another and wondering what had happened to them.... No wonder Amory was sometimes pensive.... Mr. Wilkinson, the Labour Member, had been to all intents and purposes asked not to fondle the twins.","He was a tall spare man with a great bush of pepper-and-salt hair, a Yorkshire accent, and an eye that hardly rested on any single object long enough to get more than a fleeting visual impression of it.","He wrote on the first and third weeks of the month the ""Novum's"" column of ""Military Notes,"" and on the alternate weeks filled the same column with officially inspired ""Trade Union Echoes.""",Between these two activities of Mr. Wilkinson's there was a connexion.,"He, in common with everybody else at The Witan, was loud in decrying the jobberies and vested interests of Departments, with the War Office placed foremost in the shock of his wrath.","But the Trade Unions were another matter, and never a billet-creating measure came before Parliament but he strove vehemently to have its wheels cogged in with those of the existing Trade Union machine.","That is to say, that while in theory he was for democratic competitive examination, in practice he found something to be said for jobbery, could the fitting Trade Unionist but be found.","He was, moreover, a firebrand by temperament, and this is where the connexion between the ""Military Matters"" and the ""Echoes"" appears.","Trade Unionists he declared, ought to learn to shoot.","The other side, with their cant about ""Law and Order,"" never hesitated to call out the regular troops; therefore, until the Army itself should have been won over by means of the leaflets that were disseminated for the purpose, they ought in the event of a strike to be prepared to throw up barricades, to shoot from cellar-windows, and to throw down chimney-stacks from the housetops.","Capitalist-employed troops would not destroy more property than they need; in a crooked-streeted town the advantage of long-range fire would be gone; and Mr. Wilkinson was prepared to demonstrate that a town defended on his lines could hold out, in the event of Industrial War pushed to an extreme, until it was starved into surrender.--These arguments, by the way, had impressed Mr. Prang profoundly.","Now (to come back to the twins) on Corin's fourth birthday Mr. Wilkinson, moved by these considerations, had given him a wooden gun, and in doing so had committed a double error in Amory's eyes.","His first mistake had been to suppose that even if, under the present lamentable (but nevertheless existing) conditions of militarism, Corin should ever become a soldier at all, he would be the uncommissioned bearer of a gun and not the commissioned bearer of a sword.","And his second mistake had been like unto it, namely, to think that, in the case of a proletariat uprising say in Cardiff or York, Corin would not similarly have held some post of weight and responsibility on the other side.",Corin shoot up through the street-trap of a coal-hole or pot somebody from behind a chimney-stack!...,But Amory admitted that it must be difficult for Mr. Wilkinson to shake off the effects of his upbringing.,"That upbringing had been very different from, say, Mr. Brimby's.","Mr. Brimby had been at Oxford, and in nobly stooping to help the oppressed brought as it were a fragrant whiff of graciousness and culture with him.",Mr. Wilkinson was a nobody.,"He came from the stratum of need, and, when it came to fondling the twins, must not think himself a Brimby....","Therefore, Amory had had to ask him to take the gun back (a deprivation which had provoked a mighty outcry from Corin), and to give him, if he must give him something, a Nature book instead.","Katie Deedes and Dickie Lemesurier were both permitted to fondle the twins, though in somewhat different measure.",This difference of measure did not mean that either Katie or Dickie suffered from a chronic cold that the twins might have contracted.,Here again the case was almost as complicated as the case of Mr. Wilkinson.,Cases had a way of being complicated at The Witan.,"It was this:-- Both of these ladies, as Amory had assured Mr. Brimby, were ""quite all right.""",She meant socially.,No such difference was to be found between them in this respect as that which yawned between Mr. Brimby and Mr. Wilkinson.,"Indeed as far as Dickie was concerned, Amory had given a little apologetic laugh at the idea of her having to place and appraise a Lemesurier of Bath at all.","The two girls had equally to work for their living, and--but perhaps it was here that the difference came in.",There are jobs and jobs.,It was a question of tone.,"Dickie, running the Suffrage Book Shop, enjoyed something of the glamour of Letters; but Katie, as manageress of the Eden Restaurant, was, after all, only a caterer.",It was not Amory's fault that Romance had pronounced arbitrarily and a little harshly on the relative dignity of these occupations.,"She could not help it that books are books and superior, while baked beans are only baked beans, necessary, but not to be talked about.","If Dickie had, by her calling, a shade more consideration than was strictly her due, while Katie, by hers, was slightly shorn of something to which she would otherwise have been entitled, well, it was not Amory who had arranged it so.",But between books and baked beans the twins did not hesitate for an instant.,They saw from no point of view but their unromantic own.,"Dickie, overhauling the remainder stock at the Suffrage Shop, was able to bring them a book from time to time; but Katie, whose days were spent in a really interesting place full of things to eat, brought them sweetened Proteids, and cold roasted chestnuts, and sugared Filbertine, and sometimes a pot of the Eden Non-Neuritic Honey for tea.","And because the flesh was stronger in them than Amory thought it ought to be (at any rate until the day should come when they must leave the tribe with a copy of ""Leaves of Grass"" in their hands), they adored Katie and thought very much less of Dickie.","Now this belly-guided preference was a thing to be checked in them; and one day Amory had asked Katie (quite nicely and gently) whether she would mind _not_ bringing the children things that spoiled their appetites, not to speak of their tempers when they clamoured for these comestibles at times when they were not to be had.","Then, one afternoon in the nursery, Amory actually had to repeat her request.","Half an hour later, when the children had been brought down into the studio for their after-tea hour, she learned that Katie had left the house.",It was Corin himself who informed her of this.,"""Auntie Katie was crying,"" he said.","""About the vertisements,"" he added.","""_Ad_-vertisements, dear,"" Amory corrected him.","""Say _ad_-vertisements, not vertisements.""","""_Ad_-vertisements,"" said Corin sulkily.","""But--"" and he cheered up again, ""--she _was_, mother.""","""Nonsense,"" said Amory.","""And you're not to say 'Auntie' to Katie.",It isn't true.,"Your Auntie is your father's or your mother's sister, and we haven't any.... And now you've played enough.","Say good-night, both of you, and take Auntie Dickie's book, and ask Miss Belchamber to read you the story of the Robin and her Darling Eggs, and then you must have your baths and go to bed.""","""I want the tale about Robin Hood, that Mr. Strong once told me,"" Corin demurred.","""No, you must have the one about the dear Dickie Bird, who had a wing shot off by a cruel man one day, and had to hide her head under the other one, so that when her Darling Eggs were hatched out the poor little birds were all born with crooked necks--you remember what I told you about the fortress in a horrible War, when the poor mothers were all so frightened that all the little boys and girls were born lame--it's the same thing--"" ""Were there guns, that went bang?""",Corin demanded.,He had forgotten that the story contained this really interesting detail.,"""Yes.""","""Great big ones?""",Corin's eyes were wide open.,"""Very big.","It was very cruel and anti-social.""","But Corin's momentary interest waned again.--""I want Robin Hood,"" he said sullenly.","""Now you're being naughty, and I shall have to send you to bed without any nice reading at all.""","""I want Robin Hood.""","The tone was ominous.... ""And I want some chestnuts,"" Bonniebell chimed in, her face also puckering.... And so Amory, who had threatened to send them bookless to bed, must keep her word.",It is very wrong to tell falsehoods to children.,"She dismissed them, and they went draggingly out, their Boutet de Monvel hair and fringed _eponge_ costumes giving them the appearance of two luckless pawns that had been pushed off the board in some game of chess they did not understand.",Amory thought it very foolish of Katie to take on in this way.,She might have known that her advertisements had not been refused without good reason.,"Amory had fully intended to explain all about it to Katie, but she really had had so many things to do.",Nor ought it to have needed explaining.,"Surely Katie could have seen for herself that Dickie's Bookshop List, with its names of Finot and Forel and Mill and the rest, was a distinction and an embellishment to the paper, while her own Filbertines and Protolaxatives were a positive disfigurement.","The proper place for these was, not in the columns of the ""Novum,"" but in the ""Please take One"" box at the Eden's door....","But if Katie intended to sulk and cry about it, well, so much the worse.... (To jump forward a little: Katie did elect to sulk.","Or rather, she did worse.",She was so ill-advised as to go behind Amory's back and to speak to Cosimo himself about the advertisements.,With that Katie's goose--or perhaps one should say her Anserine--was cooked.,Amory did not allow that kind of thing.,She certainly did not intend to explain anything after that.,It was plain as a pikestaff that Katie was jealous of Dickie.,Amory was bitterly disappointed in Katie.,Of course she would not forbid her the house; she was still free to come to The Witan whenever she liked; but--somehow Katie only came once more.,"She found herself treated so very, very kindly....","So she gulped down a sob, fondled the twins once more, and left).",Miss Britomart Belchamber saw enough of the twins not to wish to fondle them very much.,"Amory was not yet absolutely sure that she fondled Cosimo instead, but she was welcome to do so if she could find any satisfaction in it.",Cosimo fondled the twins to a foolish extreme.,Mr. Prang could never get near enough to them to fondle them.,"Both Corin and Bonniebell displayed a most powerful interest in Mr. Prang, and would have stood stock-still gazing at him for an hour had they been permitted; but the moment he approached them they fled bellowing.","And in addition to these various fondlings there were casual fondlings from time to time whenever the more favoured of the ""Novum's"" contributors were asked to tea.","But the Wyrons remained, so to speak, the _ex-officio_ fondlers, and perhaps childless Laura felt a real need to fondle at her heart.","It was she who first asked Amory whether she hadn't noticed that, while Mr. Brimby and Dickie frequently fondled the twins separately, more frequently still they did so together.","""No!""",Amory exclaimed.,"""I hadn't noticed!""","""Walter thinks they would be a perfect pair,"" Laura mused.... II THE 'VERT Stan saw very little in the scheme that Dorothy darkly meditated against her aunt.",He seldom saw much in Dorothy's schemes.,"Perhaps she did not make quite enough fuss about them, but went on so quietly maturing them that her income seemed to be merely something that happened in some not fully explained but quite natural order of events.","Stan thought it rather a lucky chance that the money usually had come in when it was wanted, that was all.",But of his own job he had quite a different conception.,_That_ took thought.,This appeared plainly now that he was able to dismiss his own past failures with a light and almost derisive laugh.,"""I don't know whatever made me think there was anything in them,"" he said complacently one night within about ten days of Christmas.","He had put on his slippers and his pipe, and was drowsily stretching himself after a particularly hard ""comic film"" day, in the course of which he had been required to fall through a number of ceilings, bringing the furniture with him in his downward flight.","He had come home, had had a shampoo and a hot bath, and the last traces of the bags of flour and the sacks of soot had disappeared.","""I don't think now they'd ever have come to very much.""","""Hush a moment,"" said Dorothy, listening, her needle arrested half-way through the heel of one of his socks.... ""All right.","I thought I heard him--Yes?""",She could face young girls now.,The third Bit had turned out to be yet another boy.,"""I mean,"" Stan burbled comfortably, ""there wouldn't have been the money in them I thought there would.","Now take those salmon-flies, Dot.",Of course I can tie 'em in a way.,"But what I mean is, it's a limited market.","Not like the boot-trade, I mean, or soap, or films.",Everybody wears boots and sees films.,"There's more scope, more demand.",But everybody doesn't carry a salmon-rod.,Comparatively few people do.,And the same with big-game shooting.,Or deerstalking.,"Everybody can't afford 'em.""","""No, dear,"" said Dorothy, her eyes downcast.","""Then there was Fortune and Brooks,"" Stan continued with a great air of discovery.","""_I_ see their game now.","You see it too, don't you?--They just wanted orders.",New accounts.,That's what they wanted.,"If I could have put 'em on to a chap who'd have spent say five hundred a year on Chutney and things--well, what I mean is, where would they be without customers like that?""","""Nowhere, dear,"" said the dutiful Dorothy.","""Exactly.",Nowhere.,That's what I was leading up to.,They wouldn't be anywhere.,They just wanted to be put on to these things.,"And it's just struck me how _I_ should have looked, going out to dinner somewhere, strange house very likely, and I'd said to somebody I'd perhaps met for the first time, 'Don't think much of these salted almonds; our hostess ought to try the F. and B.","Brand, a Hundred Gold Medals, and see that the blessed coupon isn't broken.'--Eh?","See what I mean?""","""I was never very keen on the idea,"" Dorothy admitted gravely.","""No, and I'm blessed if I see why I was, now,"" Stan conceded cheerfully.... She loved this change in him which a real job with real money had brought about.","Poor old darling, she thought, it must have been pretty rotten for him before, borrowing half-crowns from her in the morning, which he would spend with an affected indifference on drinks and cab fares in the evening.",And he _should_ speak with a new authority if he wished.,Not for worlds would she have smiled at His Impudence's new air of being master in his own house.,He _should_ be a Sultan if he liked--provided he didn't want more than one wife.,"Moreover, his bringing in of money had been a relief so great that even yet she had hardly got out of the habit of reckoning on her own earnings only.","It had taken her weeks to realize that now the twopences came in just a little more quickly than they went out, and that she could actually afford herself the luxury of keeping Mr. Miller waiting for his Idea, or even of not giving it to him at all.",She really had no Idea to give him.,She was entirely wrapped up now in her plot against Lady Tasker.,"That plot, summarized from several conversations with Stan, was as follows:-- ""You see, there's the Brear, with all that land, Aunt Grace's very own.","The Cromwell Gardens lease is up in June, and it's all very well for auntie to say she doesn't hate London, but she does.","She spends half a rent, with one and another of them, in travelling backwards and forwards, and she's getting old, too.--Then there's us.","We can't go on living here, and the Tonys will be home just as Tim's leave's up, and they're sure to leave their Bits behind.",Very well.,"Now the Tims and the Tonys can't afford to pay much, but they can afford something, and I think they ought to pay.","They're sure to want those boys to go into the Army, and they'd _have_ to pay for that anyway.--So there ought to be a properly-managed Hostel sort of place, paying its way, and a fund accumulating, and Aunt Gracie at the head of it, poor old dear, but somebody to do the work for her.--I don't see why we shouldn't clear out that old billiard-table that nobody ever uses, and throw that and the gun-room into one, and make that the schoolroom, and have a proper person down--a sort of private preparatory school for Sandhurst and Woolwich, and the money put by to help with the fees afterwards.",It would be much easier if we all clubbed together.,"And I should jolly well make Aunt Eliza give us at least a thousand pounds--selfish old thing.""","""Frightful rows there'd be,"" Stan usually commented, thinking less of Dorothy's plan than of his own last trick-tumble.","""Like putting brothers into the same regiment; always a mistake.","And we're all rather good at rows you know.""","""Well, they're our _own_ rows anyway.",We keep 'em to ourselves.,And we _do_ all mean pretty much the same thing when all's said.,"I'm going to work it all out anyway, and then tackle Aunt Grace.... _I_ shall manage it, of course.""",She did not add that her Lennards and Taskers and Woodgates would sink their private squabbles precisely in proportion as the outside attacks on their common belief rendered a closing-up of the ranks necessary.,"But she _had_ been to The Witan and had kept her eyes open there, and knew that there were plenty of other Witans about.","If stupid Parliament, with its votes and what not, couldn't think of anything to do about it, that was no reason why she should not do something, and make stingy old Aunt Eliza pay for the training of her Bits into the bargain.","She had not seen Amory since that day when the episode of the winter woollies had made her angry, for, though Amory had called once at the Nursing Home soon after the birth of the third Bit, Dorothy had really not felt equal to the hair-raising tale of the twins all over again, and had sent a message down to her by the nurse.","There was this difference between this tragic recital of Amory's and the fervour with which Ruth Mossop always hugged to her breast the thought of the worst that could happen--that Ruth _had_ known brutality, and so might be forgiven for getting ""a little of her own back""; but Amory had known one hardish twelvemonths perhaps, a good many years ago and when she had been quite able to bear it, and had since magnified that period of discomfort by a good many diameters.","Amory, Dorothy considered, didn't really know she was born.",She was unfeignedly sorry for that.,Whatever measure of contempt was in her she kept for Cosimo.,For she considered that Cosimo was at the bottom of all the trouble.,"If Stan, at his most impecunious and happy-go-lucky, could still stalk about the house saying ""Dot, I won't have this,"" or ""Look here, Dorothy, that has got to stop,"" it seemed to her that Cosimo, with never a care on his mind that was not his own manufacture, might several times have prevented Amory from making rather a fool of herself.",But it seemed to Dorothy that kind of man was springing up all over the place nowadays.,Mr. Brimby was another of them.,"Dorothy had read one of Mr. Brimby's books--""_The Source_,"" and hadn't liked it.",She had thought it terribly dismal.,"In it a pretty and rich young widow, who might almost have been Amory herself, went slumming, and spent a lot of money in starting a sort of Model Pawn Shop, and by and by there came a mysterious falling-off in her income, and she went to see her lawyer about it, and learned, of course, that her source of income was that very slum in which she had stooped to labour so angelically.... Dorothy didn't know very much about pawnshops, but then she didn't believe that Mr. Brimby did either; and if her interest in them ever should become really keen, she didn't think she should go to Oxford for information about them.","And Mr. Brimby himself seemed to feel this ""crab,"" as Stan would have called it, for after ""_The Source_"" he had written a Preface for a book by a real and genuine tramp....

And so she walked, feeling herself special and strange and frightened and half-resolved; and thrice in as many weeks Lady Tasker, sitting with her crochet at her window, had seen her pass, but had not been able to believe that this was the woman, with a husband and children, on whom she had once called at that house with the secretive privet hedge away in Hampstead.","*       *       *       *       * ""It _is_ Amory!""",Dorothy exclaimed.,"""Is she coming here?""","Lady Tasker spoke reflectively.--""I don't know.",I don't think so.,But--will you fetch her in?,"I should like to see her.""","""If you like, auntie,"" said Dorothy, though a little reluctantly.",But Lady Tasker seemed to change her mind.,She laid down her crochet and rose.,"""No, never mind,"" she said.","""I'll fetch her myself.""","And the old lady of seventy passed slowly out of the room, and Katie and Dorothy moved away from the window.","Lady Tasker was back again in five minutes, but no Amory came with her.","She walked back to her chair, moved it, and took up her work again.--""Switch the table light on,"" she said.","""Was it Amory?""",Dorothy ventured to ask after a silence.,"""Yes,"" Lady Tasker replied.","""And wouldn't she come in?""","""She said she was hurrying back home.""",That raised a question so plain that Dorothy thought it tactful to make rather a fuss about finding some album or other that should convince Katie that she really had met the Mollie who had written the letter about the window-curtains.,Lady Tasker's needle was dancing rather more quickly than usual.,"Dorothy found her album, switched on another light, and told Katie to make room for her on her chair.","Amory, dawdling like that, and then, when spoken to, to have the face to say that she was hurrying back home!---- It was some minutes later that Lady Tasker said off-handedly, ""Has she any children besides those twins?""","""Amory?""","Dorothy replied, looking up from the album.","""No.""","""How old is she?""",Lady Tasker asked.,"""Thirty-two, isn't she, Katie?""","""About that.""","""Is she very--athletic?""",Lady Tasker next wanted to know.,"""Not at all, I should say.""","""I mean she doesn't go in for marathon races or Channel swimming or anything of that kind?""","""Amory?","No,"" said Dorothy, puzzled.","""And you're sure of her age?""",the old lady persisted.,"""Well--she may only be thirty-one.""","""I don't mean is she younger.","Is she _older_ than that?""","""No--I know by my own age.""","""H'm!""","said Lady Tasker; and again her needle danced.... Dorothy was explaining to Katie that Mollie was fair, about her own colour, but of course the hair never came out right in a photograph, when Lady Tasker suddenly began a further series of questions.","""Dorothy----"" ""Yes?""","""Did she--develop--early?""","""Who--Amory?",I don't know.,"Did she, Katie?","Of course she was quite the cleverest girl at the McGrath.""","""Ah!...","What did she do at the McGrath?""","""Why, painted.","You're awfully mysterious, auntie!","It was soon after she left the McGrath that she painted 'Barrage'--you've heard of her feminist picture that made such a stir!""","""Ah, yes.",Yes.,"I didn't see it, but I did hear about it.","I don't know anything about art.--Had she any affair before she married young Pratt?""","""No.",I'm sure of that.,"I knew her so well.""","Dorothy was quite confident on that point, and Katie agreed.",Lady Tasker's questions continued.,"And then, suddenly, into this apparently aimless catechism the word ""doctor"" came.",Dorothy gave a start.,"""Aunt Grace!...","Do you mean Amory's ill?""",she cried.,"Lady Tasker did not look up from her crochet.--""Ill?""",she said.,"""I've no reason to suppose so.",I didn't say she was ill.,"There's no illness about it.... By the way, I don't think I've asked how Stan is.""","But for the curiously persistent questions, Dorothy might have seized the opportunity to hint that Stan was made for something more nationally useful than getting himself black and blue by stopping runaway horses for the film or running the risk of double pneumonia by being fished out of the sea on a January day--which was the form his bread-winning was taking on that particular week-end.",But the Ludlow design was for the moment forgotten.,"She would have liked to ask her aunt straight out what she really meant, but feared to be rude.","So she turned to the album again, and again Katie, turning from turban to staff-cap and from staff-cap to pith helmet, urged that _those_ were the people who really knew what they were talking about--surely Dorothy saw _that_!---- Then, in the middle of Dorothy's bewilderment, once more the questions.... About that painting of her friend's, Lady Tasker wanted to know: did Mrs. Pratt get any real satisfaction out of it?--Any emotional satisfaction?--Was she entirely wrapped up in it?--Or was it just a sort of hitting at the air?--Did it exhaust her to no purpose, or was it really worth something when it was done?---- ""If Dorothy doesn't know, surely you do, Katie.""","Katie coloured a little.--""I liked 'Barrage' awfully at the time,"" she confessed, ""but--,"" and she cheered up again, ""--I _hate_ it now.""","""But did her work--what's the expression?--fill her life?""","Here Dorothy answered for Katie.--""I think she rather liked the fame part of it,"" she said slowly.","""Does she paint now?""","""Very little, I think, Lady Tasker.""","""Has her children to look after, I suppose?""","""Well--she has both a nurse and a governess----"" ""They're quite well off, aren't they?","I seem to remember that Pratt came into quite a lot.""","""They seem to spend a great deal.""","""But that's only a small house of theirs?""","""Oh, yes, they're rather proud of that.",They don't spend their money selfishly.,"It goes to the Cause, you see.""","""What Cause?""",Lady Tasker asked abruptly.,"This was Katie's cue.... She ceased, and Lady Tasker muttered something.","It sounded rather like ""H'm!","Too much money and not enough to do!""",but neither of her companions was near enough to be quite sure.,And thereupon the questions stopped.,But a surmise of their drift had begun to dawn glimmeringly upon Dorothy.,"She ceased to hear the exposition of Imperialism's real needs into which Katie presently launched, and fell into a meditation.","And of that meditation this was about the length and breadth:-- Until the law should allow a man to have more wives than one (if then), of course only one woman in the world could be perfectly happy--the woman who had Stan.","That conviction came first, and last, and ran throughout her meditation.",And of what Dorothy might compassionately have called secondary happinesses she had hitherto not thought very much.,"She had merely thanked her stars that she had not married a man like Cosimo, had once or twice rather resented Amory's well-meant but left-handed kindnesses, and that had been the extent of her concern about the Pratt household.","But first Katie, and now her aunt, had set her wondering hard enough about that household now.","What, she asked herself, had the Pratts married on?","What discoveries had they made in one another, what resources found within themselves?","Apart from their talks and books and meetings and ""interests"" and that full pack of their theories, what was their marriage?","Thrown alone together for an hour, did they fret?",Did their yawning cease when the bell rang and a caller was admitted?,"Did even the same succession of callers become stale and a bore, so that strangers had to be sought to provide a stimulus?","And did they call these and half a hundred other forms of mutual boredom by the rather resounding names that blabbing Katie had repeated to her--""wider interests,"" ""the broad outlook,"" ""the breaking down of personal insularity,"" and the rest?",And for once Dorothy dropped her excusatory attitude towards her friend.,She dropped it so completely that by and by she found herself wondering whether Amory would have married Cosimo had he been a poor man.,"She was aware that, stated in that way, it sounded hideous; nor did she quite mean that perhaps Amory had married Cosimo simply and solely because he had _not_ been poor; no doubt Amory had assumed other things to be equal that as a matter of fact had unfortunately proved to be not equal at all; but she _did_ doubt now whether Amory had not missed that something, that something made of so many things, that caused her own heart suddenly to gush out to the absent Stan.",The thought frightened her a little.,"Had Amory married and had babies--all, as it were, beside the mark?...",Dorothy did not know.,But an obscurer hint still had seemed to lie behind her aunt's persistent questions.,"""Was Amory ill?""","she herself had asked in alarm when that unexpected word ""doctor"" had been quietly dropped; and ""Ill?","I didn't say she was ill; there's no illness about it,"" Lady Tasker had replied.",No illness about what?,"Apparently about something Lady Tasker saw, or thought she saw, in Amory.... An old lady whose years had earned her the right to sit comfortably in her chair had gone so far as to descend the stairs and go out into the street to have a closer look at a young one: why?","Why ask ""Is she a Channel swimmer?""","and ""Is her painting a mere hitting of the air?""","Why this insistence on some satisfaction for labour, as if without that satisfaction the labour wreaked on the labourer some sort of revenge?",What sort of a revenge?,And why on Amory?,"Yes, Dorothy would have liked to ask her aunt a good many questions.... She did not know that Lady Tasker could not have answered them.",She did not know that the whole world is waiting for precisely those replies.,She did not know that the data of a great experiment have not yet begun to be gathered together.,"She did not know that, while she and Stan would never see the results of that experiment, little Noel and the other Bits, and Corin and Bonniebell might.","She only knew that her aunt was a wise and experienced woman, with an appetite for life and all belonging to it that only grew the stronger as her remaining years drew in, and that apparently Lady Tasker found something to question, if not to fear.","""Is she a Channel swimmer?","Does she get any emotional satisfaction out of what she does?""","They were oddly precise questions.... Much less odd was that homely summing-up of Lady Tasker's: ""Too much money, and not enough to do.""...",Dorothy had often thought that herself.,"V ""HOUSE FULL"" The gate in the privet hedge of The Witan had had little rest all the afternoon.","It was a Sunday, the one following that on which Lady Tasker had issued bareheaded from her door, had crossed the road, and had caused Amory to start half out of her skin by suddenly speaking to her.","The Wyrons had come in the morning; they had been expressly asked to lunch; but it was known that Dickie Lemesurier was coming in afterwards to discuss an advertisement, and if Dickie came the chances were that Mr. Brimby would not be very long after her.","As a matter of fact Dickie and Mr. Brimby had encountered one another outside and had arrived together at a little after three, bringing three young men, friends of Mr. Brimby's still at Oxford, with them.","These young men wore Norfolk jackets, gold-pinned polo-collars, black brogues and turned-up trousers; and apparently they had hesitated to take Cosimo at his word about ""spreading themselves about anywhere,"" for they stood shoulder to shoulder in the studio, and when one turned to look at a picture or other object on the wall, all did so.","Then, not many minutes later, Mr. Wilkinson had entered, in his double-breasted blue reefer, bringing with him a stunted, bowlegged man who did not carry, but looked as if he ought to have carried, a miner's lamp; and by half-past four, of The Witan's habitues, only Mr. Prang and Edgar Strong were lacking.",But Edgar was coming.,"It had been found impossible, or at any rate Amory had decided that it was impossible, to discuss the question of Dickie's advertisement without him.",But he was very late.,"When Britomart Belchamber came in simultaneously with the tea and the twins at a little before five, the studio was full.","The asbestos log purred softly, and Mr. Brimby's three Oxford friends, glad perhaps of something to do, walked here and there, each of them with a plate of bread and butter in either hand, not realizing that at The Witan the beautiful Chinese rule of politeness was always observed--""When the stranger is in your melon-patch, be a little inattentive.""","Had Dickie Lemesurier and Laura Wyron eaten half the white and brown that was presented to them, they must have been seriously unwell.","It was Cosimo, grey-collared and with a claret-coloured velvet waistcoat showing under his slackly-buttoned tweed jacket, who gave the young men the friendly hint, ""Everybody helps themselves here, my dear fellows.""","Then the Norfolk jackets came together again, and presently their owners turned with one accord to examine the hock and the top-side that hung on the wall over the sofa.",Not so much a blending of voices as an incessant racket of emphatic and independent pronouncements filled the studio.,"Walter Wyron had fastened upon the man who looked as if he ought to have carried a miner's lamp, and his forefinger was wagging like a gauge-needle as he explained that one of his Lectures had been misrepresented, and that he had _never_ taken up the position that a kind of Saturnalia should be definitely state-established.","He admitted, nevertheless, that the question of such an establishment ought to be considered, like any other question, on its merits, and that after that the argument should be followed whithersoever it led.--Dickie Lemesurier, excessively animated, and with the whites showing dancingly all round her pupils, was talking Cesanne and Van Gogh to Laura, and declaring that something was ""quite the"" something or other.--Mr.",Brimby's hand was fondling Bonniebell's head while he deprecated the high degree of precision of the modern rifle to Mr. Wilkinson.,"""If only it wasn't so ruthlessly logical!""",he was sighing.,"""If only it was subject to the slight organic accident, to those beautiful adaptations of give-and-take that make judgment harsh, and teach us that we ought never to condemn!""","--Corin, drawn by the word ""gun,"" was demanding to be told whether that was the gun that had been taken away from him.--And Britomart Belchamber, indifferent alike to the glances of the Oxford men and their trepidation in her presence, stood like a caryatid under a wall-bracket with an ivy-green replica of Bastianini's Dante upon it.","""No, no, not for a moment, my dear sir!""",Walter shouted to the man who looked like (and was) a miner.,"""That is to ignore the context.",I admit I used the less-known Pompeian friezes as a rough illustration of what I meant--but I did _not_ suggest that Waring & Gillow's should put them on the market!,What I did say was that we moderns must work out our damnation on the same lines that the ancients did.,"Read your Nietzsche, my good fellow, and see what _he_ says about the practical serviceability of Excess!","I contend that a kind of general _oubliance_, say for three weeks in the year, to which everybody without exception would have to conform (so that we shouldn't have the superior person bringing things up against us afterwards)----"" ""Ah doan't see how ye could mak' fowk----,"" the miner began, in an accent that for a moment seemed to blast a hole clean through the racket.",But the hole closed up again.,"""Ah, at present you don't,"" Walter cried.","""The spade-work isn't done yet.",We need more education.,"But every new and great idea----"" But here an outburst from Mr. Wilkinson to Mr. Brimby drowned Walter's voice.","Mr. Wilkinson raised his clenched fist, but only for emphasis, and not in order to strike Mr. Brimby.","""Stuff and nonsense!","There you go, Brimby, trimming again!","We've heard all that: 'A great deal to be said on both sides,'""--(Mr. Wilkinson all but mimicked Mr. Brimby).","""There isn't--not if you're going to do anything!",There's only one side.,You've got to shoot or be shot.,I'm a shooter.,"Give me five hundred real men and plenty of barricade stuff----"" ""Oh, oh, oh, my dear friend!""",Mr. Brimby protested.,"""Why, if your principles were universally applied----"" ""Who said anything about applying 'em universally?",Hang your universal applications!,I'm talking about the Industrial Revolution.,"I'll tell you what's the matter with you, Brimby: you don't like the sight of blood.",I'm not blaming you.,Some men are like that.,But it's in every page of your writing.,You've got a bloodless style.,"I don't mind admitting that I liked some of your earlier work, while there still seemed a chance of your making up your mind some day----"" But here Mr. Wilkinson in his turn was drowned, this time by an incredulous laugh from Cosimo, who had joined Dickie and Laura.","""Van Gogh says _that_?""",his voice mounted high.,"""Really?",You're sure he wasn't joking?,Ha ha ha ha!...,But it's rather pathetic really.,"One would think Amory'd never painted 'Barrage,' nor the 'White Slave,' nor that--,"" he pointed to the unfinished canvas of ""The Triumph of Humane Government"" on the wall.","""By Jove, I must make an Appendix of that!...","Here--Walter!--Have you told him, Dickie?--Walter!----"" But Walter was now at deadly grips with the man who had forgotten his miner's lamp.","""I tell you I never used Saturnalia in that sense at all!----"" But the miner stood his ground.","""Happen ye didn't, but I'll ask ye one question: Have ye ever been to Blackpool of a August Bank Holiday?----"" ""My good man, you talk as if I proposed to do something with the stroke of a pen, to-morrow, before the world's ready for it----"" ""Have ye ever been to Blackpool of a Bank Holiday?""","""What on earth has Blackpool to do with it?----"" ""Well, we'll say Owdham Wakes week at t' Isle o' Man--Douglas----"" ""Pooh!",You've got hold of the wrong idea altogether!,"Do you know what Saturnalia _means_?----"" ""I know there's a man on Douglas Head, at twelve o'clock i' t' day, wi' t' sun shining, going round wi' a stick an' prodding 'em up an' telling 'em to break away----"" ""I shouldn't have thought anybody could have been so _incredibly_ slow to grasp an idea--!""","cried Walter, his hands aloft.","""Have--you--ever--been--to--Blackpool--when--t' Wakes--is on?""","Then Cosimo called again-- ""Walter!",I say!,Come here!...,"Dickie's just told me something that makes the '_Life and Work_' _rather_ necessary, I think!----"" And Walter turned his back on the miner and joined his wife and Dickie and Cosimo.","Anybody who wasn't anybody might have supposed the noise to be a series of wrangles, but of course it wasn't so at all really.",Issues far too weighty hung in the balance.,"It is all very well for people whose mental range is limited by _matinees_ and Brooklands and the newest car to talk in pleasant and unimpassioned voices, but what was going to happen to Art unless Cosimo hurled himself and the '_Life and Work_' against this heretic Van Gogh, and what was to become of England if Walter allowed a pig-headed man who could say nothing but ""Blackpool Pier, Blackpool Pier,"" to shout him down, and what would happen to Civilization if Mr. Wilkinson did not, figuratively speaking, take hold of the dilettante Brimby and shake him as a terrier shakes a rat?",No: there would be time enough for empty politenesses when the battle was won.,"In the meantime, a mere nobody might have thought they were merely excessively rude to one another.",Then began fresh combinations and permutations of the talk.,"Mr. Wilkinson, whose square-cut pilot jacket somehow added to the truculence of his appearance, planted himself firmly for conversation before Dickie Lemesurier; the miner, whose head at a little distance appeared bald, but on a closer view was seen to be covered with football-cropped and plush-like bristles, nudged Cosimo's hip, to attract his attention: and Walter Wyron sprang forward with a welcoming ""Hallo, Raffinger!""",as the door opened and two young McGrath students were added to the crowd.,"For a minute no one voice preponderated in the racket; it was-- ""Hallo, Raff!","Thought you weren't coming!""","""I want a gun!""",(This from Corin.),"""My dear Corin"" (this from Bonniebell), ""Miss Belchamber's told you over and over again guns are anti-social----"" ""Anybody smoking?","Well, I know they don't mind----"" ""But, Miss Lemesurier, where a speaker reaches only a hundred or two, the written word----"" ""Ah, but the personal, magnetic thrill----"" (This was in Dickie's rather deep voice.)","Then Walter, to somebody else, not the miner-- ""I should have thought _anybody_ would have known that when I said Saturnalia I meant----"" ""Where's Amory?""","""Sweet, in those little tunics!----"" ""A subsidy from the State, of course----"" Then the miner, but not to Walter-- ""I' t' daylight, proddin' 'em up wi' a stick--to say nowt o' Port Skillian bathin'-place of a fine Sunda'----"" ""That hoary old lie, that Socialism means sharing----"" ""Oh, at any artists' colourman's----"" ""No; it will probably be published privately----"" ""Van Gogh----"" ""Oh, you're _entirely_ wrong!----"" And then, in the middle of a sudden and mysterious lull, the man who had come without his safety-lamp was heard addressing Cosimo again:-- ""Well, what about t' new paaper?",Owt settled yet?...,"Nay, ye needn't look; Wilkinson telled me; it's all right; nowt 'at's said 'll go beyond these fower walls.","Wilkinson's gotten a rare list together, names an' right, I can tell ye!","But t' way I look at it is this----"" Cosimo looked blank.","""But, my dear--I'm afraid I didn't catch your name----,"" he said.","""Crabtree--Eli Crabtree.","This is t' point I want to mak', mister.","Ye see, I can't put things grammar; but there's lots about 'at can; so I thowt we'd get a sec'etary, an' I'd sit an' smoke whol' my thowts come, and then I'd tell him t' tale.","Ye

to put it grammar for me----"" ""My dear Crabtree, I'm afraid, don't you know, that there's been some mistake----"" And at this point, everybody becoming conscious at the same moment that they were listening, a fresh wave of sound flowed over the assembly; and presently Mr. Wilkinson was seen to take Cosimo aside and to be making the gestures of a man who is explaining some ridiculous mistake.","Then once more:-- ""I beg your pardon--I thought you were Mrs. Pratt----"" ""Put grammar--straight to fowk's hearts--sinks and slopstones an' all t' lot----"" ""No, Balliol----"" ""But listen, Pratt, the way the mistake arose----"" ""Ellen Key, of course----"" ""The 'Times!'","--As if the 'Times' wasn't _always_ wrong!----"" ""There's a raucousness about her paint----"" ""The Caxton Hall, at eight--do come!----"" ""But we authors are so afraid of sentiment nowadays!----"" ""Bombay, I think--or else Hyderabad----"" ""Oh, he talks like a fool!----"" ""Raff!","Come here and recite '_The King is Duller_'----"" ""But Love _is_ Law!----"" ""Suspend our judgments until we've heard the other side----"" ""Only water--but they couldn't break her spirit--she was out again in three days----"" And again there came an unexpected lull.","This time it was broken by, perhaps not the loudest, but certainly the most travelling voice yet--the voice of the caryatid beneath the bracket with the bust upon it.",Miss Belchamber was dressed in a sleeveless surcoat chess-boarded with large black and white squares; the skirt beneath it was of dark blue linen; and there were beards of leather on her large brown brogues.,"One of the young Oxford men, greatly daring, had approached her and asked her a question.",She turned slowly; she gave the young man the equal-soul-to-equal-soul look; and then the apparatus of perfect voice-production was set in motion.,"Easily and powerfully the air came from her magnificent chest, up the splendid six-inch main of her throat, rang upon the hard anterior portion of her palate, and was cut, as it were, to its proper length and shaped into perfect enunciation by her red tongue and beautiful white teeth.","""What?""",she said.,The undergraduate fell a little back.,"""Only--I only asked if you'd been to many theatres lately.""","""Not any.""","""Oh!...","I--I suppose you know everybody here?""","""Yes.""","""Do point them out to me!""","""That's Walter Wyron.",That's Mrs. Wyron.,That's Miss Lemesurier.,I don't know who the little man is.,That's Mr. Wilkinson.,"My name's Belchamber.""","""Oh--I say--I mean, thanks awfully.","We've heard of them all, of course,"" the unhappy young man faltered.","""What?""","""All distinguished names, I mean.""","""Of course.""","""Rather!----"" And again everybody listened, became conscious of the fact, and broke out anew.",But where all this time was Amory?,"Demonstrably, exactly where she ought to have been--in her bedroom.","She was too dispirited to be accessible to the rational talk of others; she did not feel that she had energy enough to be a source of illumination herself; surely, then, merely because a lot of people, invited and uninvited, chose to come to The Witan, she need not put herself out to go and look after them.","They might call themselves her ""guests"" if they liked; Amory didn't care what form of words they employed; the underlying reality remained--that she was intensely bored, and too fundamentally polite to bore others by going down.",Perhaps she would go down when Edgar came.,She had left word that she was to be informed of his arrival.,But he was very late.,"Nevertheless, she knew that he would come.",Lately she had grown a little more perspicacious about that.,"It had dawned on her that, everything else apart, she had some sort of hold on him through the ""Novum,"" and there had been a trace of command in her summons that he was pretty sure not to disregard.","No doubt he would try to get away again almost directly, but she had arranged about that.",She intended to keep him to supper.,Also the Wyrons.,And Britomart Belchamber too would be there.,And of course Cosimo.,"She moved restlessly between her narrow bed and the window, now polishing her nails, now glancing at her hair in the glass.","From the window she could see over the privet hedge and down the road, but there was no sign of Edgar yet.","She looked at herself again in the glass, without favour, and then sat down on the edge of her bed again.",Her meeting with Lady Tasker the week before had greatly unsettled her.,"Very stupidly, she had quite forgotten that Lady Tasker lived in Cromwell Gardens.","She would have thought nothing at all of the meeting had Lady Tasker had a hat on her head and gloves on her hands; she would have set that down as an ordinary street-encounter; but Dorothy's aunt had evidently seen her from some window, perhaps not for the first time, and, if not for the first, very likely for the third or fourth or fifth.","In a word, Amory felt that she had been caught.","And, as she had been thinking of Edgar Strong at the moment when the old lady's voice had startled her so, it was not beyond the bounds of possibility that her start had seemed remarkable.",Lady Tasker was so very sharp.,"At all events, even Edgar was not going to have everything all his own way.","For she was sure now that she had the hold of the ""Novum"" on him, and that that hold was not altogether the single-minded devotion to his duty he had made it out to be on that day when she had last gone to the office.",Not that she thought too unkindly of him on that account.,"The labourer, even in the field of Imperial Politics, is still worthy of his hire, and poor Edgar, like the rest of the world, had to make the best compromise he could between what he would have liked to do and what circumstances actually permitted him to do.",Of course he would be anxious to keep his job.,"If he didn't keep it a worse man would get it, and India would be no better off, but probably worse.",She sighed that all work should be subject to compromises of this kind.,"Edgar, in a word, was no longer a hero to her, but, by his very weakness, something a little nearer and dearer still.","But for all that she had not hesitated to use her ""pull"" in order to get him to The Witan that day.",She saw him as she advanced to the glass again.,He was nearly a quarter of a mile down the road.,She found a little secret delight in watching his approach when he was unconscious of her watching.,"His figure was still very small, and she indulged herself with a fancy, closing her eyes for a moment in order to do so.","Suppose he had been, not approaching, but going away--then when she opened her eyes again he would look smaller still....

the subject of them was, of course, Mr. Crabtree.","To his general harangue Mr. Crabtree had added, before leaving, more particular words of advice, making a second tour of the studio for the purpose; and he had distinguished Walter above all the rest by inviting him, not merely to the house four doors from the ""Arabian Horse,"" but to spend a warm afternoon with him on Douglas Head also.",But the Wyrons had these raptures pretty much to themselves.,"Perhaps Cosimo was thinking of Mr. Wilkinson, of some new paper of which he had never heard, and of the assumption that he, apparently, was to find the money for it.","Miss Belchamber was rarely rapturous, so that her silence was nothing out of the way.","Edgar Strong could be rapturous when he chose, but he evidently didn't choose now.",And Amory had far too much on her mind.,"Her original idea in asking the Wyrons to stay to supper had been that they, as acknowledged experts in the subject that perplexed her, would be the proper people to keep the ring while the four persons immediately concerned talked the whole situation quietly and reasonably and thoroughly out.",But she was rather inclined now to think again before submitting her case to them.,"It would be so much better, if the case must be submitted to anybody, that Cosimo should do it.",Then she herself would be able to shape her course in the light of anything that might turn up.,"Nothing, she had to admit, had turned up yet, and Amory was not sure that in that very fact there did not lie a sufficient cause for resentment.",Had Cosimo pleaded a passion for Britomart Belchamber he would have had Passion's excuse.,"Lacking Passion, it could only be concluded that he was bored with Amory herself.",And that amounted to an insult....,"The booming of the gong, however, cut short her brooding.",They passed to the dining-room.,Britomart and Walter sat with their backs to the tall black dresser with the willow pattern stretching up almost to the ceiling; Laura and Edgar took the German chairs that had their backs to the copper-hooded fireplace; and Cosimo and Amory occupied either end of the highly-polished clothless table.,"This absence of cloth, by the way, gave a church-like appearance to the flames of the candles in the spidery brass sticks that had each of them a ring at the top to lift it up by; the preponderance of black oak and dull black frames on the walls further added to the effect of gloom; and the putting down of the little green pipkins of soup and the moving of the green-handled knives and round-bowled spoons made little knockings from time to time.","Again Walter and Laura, with not too much help from Cosimo, sustained the weight of the conversation; and it was not until Amory asked a question in a tone from which rapture was markedly absent that they sponged, as it were, the priceless memory of Mr. Crabtree from their minds.","Amory's question had been about Walter's new Lecture, still in course of preparation, on ""_Post-Dated Passion_""; and Walter cursorily ran over its heads for the general benefit.","""I admit I got the idea from Balzac,"" he said between mouthfuls (whenever they came to The Witan the Wyrons supped almost as heartily as did Edgar Strong himself).","""'Comment l'amour revient aux vieillards,' you know.",But of course that hasn't any earthly interest for anybody.,'Aux vieilles' it ought to be.,"Then--well, then you've simply got 'em.""","""Why not 'vieillards?'""","Amory asked, not very genially.","""I say, Cosimo, I'll have another cutlet if I may.--Why not 'vieillards?'",Quite obvious.,Men aren't the interest.,"I've tried men, and you can ask Laura how the bookings went.--But 'vieilles' and I've got 'em.","Really, Amory, you're getting quite dull if you don't see that!",I'll explain.,"You see, I've already got the younger ones, like Brit here--shove the claret along, Brit--but the others, of forty or fifty say, well, they've all had their affairs--or if they haven't better still--and it's merely a question of touching the right chord.","Regrets, time they've lost, fatal words 'Too late' and so on--it's simply _made_ for me!",Touch the chord and they do the rest for themselves.,"They probably won't hear half of it for sobbing.--Of course I shall probably have to modify my style a bit--not quite so--what shall I say----"" ""Jaunty,"" his wife suggested, ""--in the best sense, I mean----"" ""Hm--that's not quite the word--but never mind.",It's a great field.,"Certainly women, not men, are the draw.""","Amory made a rather petulant objection, and the argument lasted some minutes.","In the end Walter triumphantly gained his first point, that women and not men were the ""draw"" in the box-office sense, and also his second one, namely, that not the Britomarts, but the older women, who would put their hearts into his hands and pay him for exploiting their helplessness and ache and tenderness and regret, and never suspect that they were being practised upon, were ""simply made for him...."" ""What do you think of my title?""",he asked.,And the title was discussed.,Amory was beginning to find Walter just a little grasping.,She wished that after all she had not asked the Wyrons to stay to supper.,"Formerly she had thought that marriage-escapade of theirs big and heroic (that too, by the way, had been in the Latin Quarter, and probably on seven francs a day); but now she was less sure about that.","Quite apart from the inapplicability of the Wyrons' experience to her own case, she now wondered whether theirs had in fact been experience at all.","Now that she came to think of it, they had taken no risks.","They _had_ been married, and in the last event could always turn round on their critics and silence them with that fact....",Nor was she quite so ready now to lay even the souls of Britomart and Cosimo on the dissecting-table for the sake of seeing Walter exercise his professional skill upon them.,This was not so much that she wanted to spare Cosimo and Britomart as that she did not want to give Walter a gratification.,"She was inclined to think that if Walter couldn't be a little more careful about contradicting her he might find his advertisement omitted from the ""Novum"" one week, as Katie Deedes' had been omitted, and where would he be then?","The way in which he had just said that she was ""getting quite dull"" had been next door to a rudeness....",But she had to admit that she felt dull.,"Edgar, who sat next to her, did not speak, and Cosimo, who faced her, was apparently still brooding on people who planned the spending of his money without thinking it necessary to consult him first.",She was tired of the whole of the circumstances of her life.,Paris on seven francs a day could hardly be much worse.,"Nor, if she could but shake off her lethargy, need that sum be fixed as low as seven francs.",For she had lately remembered an arrangement made between herself and Cosimo before she had ever consented to become engaged to him.,"It was a long time since either of them had spoken of this arrangement--so long that Cosimo would have been almost within his rights had he maintained that the circumstances had so altered as to make it no longer binding; but there it was, or had been, and it had never been expressly revoked.","It was the arrangement by which they had set apart a fund to insure themselves, either or both of them, against any evils that might arise from incompatibility.",Amory had no idea how the matter now stood.,"She didn't suppose for a moment that Cosimo had actually set a sum by each week or month; but, hard and fast or loose and fluid, he must have made, or be still ready to make, some provision.","It was an inherent part of the contract that a solemn affirmation, with reason shown (spiritual, not mere legal reason) by either one or the other, should constitute a sufficient claim on this fund.",Therefore Paris need not necessarily be the worst penury.,"But, for all her new inclination to leave the Wyrons out of it, she still thought it a prudent idea to carry the fight (not that there would be any fight--that was only a low way of expressing the high reasonableness that always prevailed at The Witan) to Cosimo and Britomart, rather than to have it centre about Edgar and herself.",Walter's eyes were mainly on the box-office nowadays.,The original virtue of that fine protest of theirs was--there was no use in denying it--gone.,He spread his Lectures frankly now as a net.,"Well, that was only one net more among the many nets of which she was becoming conscious.","Edgar too, poor boy, was compelled to regard even the ""Novum"" as in some manner a net.","Mr. Brimby, Amory more than guessed, had nets to spread.","Mr. Wilkinson, in his own way, was out for a catch; and Dickie fished at the Suffrage Shop; and Katie had fished at the Eden; and the only one who didn't fish was Mr. Prang, who wrote his articles about India for nothing, just to be practising his English.",And all these nets were spread for somebody's money--a good deal of it Cosimo's.,"It had been the same, though perhaps not quite so bad, at Ludlow.",That experiment on the country-side had been alarmingly costly.,And all this did not include the dozens and dozens of nets of narrower mesh.,"The ""Novum"" might gulp down money by the hundred, but the lesser things were hardly less formidable in the sum of them--subscriptions, contributions, gifts, loans, investments, shares in the Eden and the Book Shop, mortgages, second mortgages, subsidies, sums to ""tide over,"" backings, guarantees, losses cut, more good money sent to bring back the bad, fresh means of spending devised by somebody or other almost every day.",It had begun to weary even Amory.,The people who came to The Witan became rather curiously better-dressed the longer their visiting continued; but the things they professed to hold dear appeared very little further advanced.,All that first brightness and promise had gone.,Amory's interest had gone.,"She wanted to escape from it all, and to go away with Edgar appeared once more to be the readiest way out.","But, though she might now wish to keep Walter Wyron out of it all, that did not necessarily mean that Walter would be kept out.","This _ex-officio_ specialist on the (preferably female) heart, this professional rectifier of unfortunate marriages, had not done a number of years' platform-work without having discovered the peculiar beauties of the _argumentum ad hominem_, and it was one of his practices to enforce his arguments with ""Take the case of Brit here""--or ""Let's get down to the concrete: suppose Amory--"" And these descents to the particular had always a curiously accusatory effect.","Walter, interrupting Amory's meditation, broke into one of them now.","""But my dear chap,""--this was to Cosimo,""--I can't imagine what's come over all of you to-night!","First Amory, now you!",You're usually quicker than this!,"Let's take a case.--Brit here----"" One sterno-mastoid majestically turned the caryatid's head.",Again Miss Belchamber's grand thorax worked as if somebody had put a penny into the slot.,"""What?""",she said.,"""Quiet, Brit; I'm only using you as an illustration.--Suppose Brit here was to develop a passion for somebody--Cosimo, say; yes, Cosimo'll do capitally; awfully good instance of the cant that's commonly talked about 'treachery' and 'under his own roof' and all the rest of it--as if a roof wasn't a roof and it hadn't got to be under somebody's--unless they went out on the Heath!--Well, suppose it was to happen to Cosimo and Brit; what then?","We're civilized, I hope.","We're a little above the animals, I venture to think.","Amory wouldn't fly at Brit's eyes, and Brit's father wouldn't come round with a razor to cut Cosimo's throat.","In fact----"" ""My fa-ther al-ways uses a safety-razor,"" said Miss Belchamber with a reminiscent air.","""Don't interrupt, Brit.--I was going to say that the world's got past all that.","Nor Brit wouldn't fly at Amory, nor Cosimo kick the old josser out of the house--though we should be much more ready to condone that part of it if they did--if it was only to get quits with the past a bit----"" ""My fa-ther's forty-five,"" Miss Belchamber announced, as the interesting result of an interesting mental process of computation.","""Next June,"" she added.","""More interruptions from the back of the hall.--In fact, I'm not sure that _wouldn't_ be entirely defensible--Brit going for Amory and Cosimo kicking the old dodderer out, I mean.",That's the justification of the _crime passionel_.,It's the Will to Live.,And by Live I mean Love.,"It's the old saying, that kissing lips have no conscience.",Or Jove laughs at lovers' oaths.,Quite right.,It's the New Greek Spirit.,But for all that we're modern and rational about these things.,"If Strong here wanted to take Laura from me I should simply say, 'All you've got to do, my dear chap, is to table your reasons, and if they're stronger than mine you take her.'","See?""","At that Edgar Strong, like Britomart, looked up.","He spoke for the first time.--""What's that you're saying?""",he asked.,"""I don't suppose you'd want her, but suppose you did...."" Mr. Strong dropped his eyes to his plate again.--""Ah, yes,"" he said.","""Ellen Key's got something about that.""",And he relapsed into silence again.,It sounded to Amory idiotic.,"Walter was so evidently ""trying"" it on them in order to see how it would go down with an audience afterwards.","She wouldn't have scratched Britomart's eyes out for Cosimo,--but she coloured a little, and bit her lip, at the thought that somebody might want to come between herself and Edgar....","But perhaps that was what Walter meant--real affinities, as distinct from the ordinary vapid assumptions about marriages being made in Heaven.","If so, she agreed with him--not that she was much fonder of him on that account.","She wished he would keep his personalities for Cosimo and Britomart, and leave herself and Edgar alone.--Walter went on.","""And then, when you've got your New Greek Certificate, so to speak, it's plainly the duty of everybody else, not to put obstacles in your way and to threaten you with razors and cutting off supplies, but to sink their personal feelings and to do everything they can to help you.",And without snivelling either.,"I shouldn't snivel, I hope, if anybody took Laura, and she wouldn't if anybody took me----"" Here Laura interposed softly.--""I don't want any one to take you, dear,"" she said.",Walter turned sharply.,"""Eh?...",Now you've put me off my argument.... What was I saying?...,"Haven't I told you you must _never_ do that, Laura?...","No, it's quite gone.... You see ..."" Laura murmured that she was very sorry.... ""No, it's gone,"" said Walter, almost cheerfully, as if not sorry that for once the worth of what he had been about to say should be measured by the sense of loss.","""So since Laura wishes it I'll shut up.""",He passed up his plate for a second helping of trifle.,By this time Amory was perhaps rather glad that she had had the Wyrons after all.,That about people not putting obstacles in the way was quite neat.,"""A plain duty,"" he had said.","She hoped Cosimo'd heard that, and would remember it when she raised the subject of the fund.","And so far was she herself from putting obstacles in _his_ way that, although she could have sent Britomart Belchamber packing with her wages at any moment, she had not done so.","That, as Walter had said, would only have been another way of flying at her eyes....","Besides, Amory had been far too deeply occupied to formulate definitely her charges against Cosimo and Britomart.","For all she knew it might have gone much, much further than she had thought.","Sometimes, when Amory took breakfast in her own room, she did not see Cosimo until the evening, and Britomart too had heaps of time on her hands when she had finished with Corin and Bonniebell.","Cosimo must not tell her that the ""_Life and Work_"" occupied him during every minute of his time.... Then, presently, she was sorry again that the Wyrons had been asked, for Walter had suddenly remembered the thread of his discourse, and, in continuing it, had been almost rude to Laura.","She wondered whether he would have turned with a half angry ""Why, what's the matter?""",had Laura cried.,"Perhaps it was really a good thing the Wyrons hadn't any children, for this kind of thing would certainly have been a bad example for them.",She herself was never rude to Cosimo before Corin and Bonniebell.,She was always markedly polite.,"There were excuses to be made for Passion, but none for rudeness.",By this time Edgar Strong had finished his last piece of cheese and was wiping his lips with his napkin.,"Then he looked at his watch, and for the second time during the course of the meal spoke.","""Look here, Cosimo, I've got to be off presently, and we haven't settled about those advertisements yet.",And there's something else I want to say to you too.,Could we hurry coffee up?,Where do we have it?,"In the studio, I suppose?","Or do the others go into the studio and you and Walter and I have ours here?""","""We might as well all go into the studio,"" said Cosimo, rising;

but we do not particularly want the others--those who feel that in a better and brighter world they would have been students of the McGrath, but, as matters stand, are merely young clerks who can draw a little, young salesmen who can write a little, young auctioneers with an instinct for the best in sculpture, young foremen who yearn to express themselves in music, young governesses (or a few of them) who have heard of the enormous sums of money to be made by playwriting, New Imperialists, amateur regenerators, social prophets after working-hours, and, in a word, all the people who have just heard that it is not true that Satan is yet bound up for his promised stretch of a thousand years.","A terrible number of them will get in whether we wish it or not; but let the rest be our own little party; and you shall sit next to Britomart Belchamber, and I will stand by to open the windows in case we feel the need of a little fresh air.",So Mr. Brimby will open the proceedings.,"He will say the things above-mentioned, and presently, with emotion and his sense of the world's sorrow gaining on him, will come to the case of their dear friend Amory Pratt.","Here, he will say, is a young woman, one of themselves, who does not know what is the matter with her--who does not know what has become of her joy--who cannot understand (if Mr. Brimby may be allowed to express himself a little poetically) why the bloom of her life has turned to an early rime.","And so (Mr. Brimby will continue), knowing that if two heads are better than one, two hundred heads must be just one hundred times better still, their friend has submitted her case to the Meeting.",He will beg them to approach that case sympathetically.,"Let the extremists of the one part (if there be any) balance the extremists of the other, leaving as an ideal and beautiful middle nullity those words he had used before, but did not apologize for using again--to know all is to forgive all.","And with these few remarks (if we are lucky), Mr. Brimby will say no more, but will call upon their friend Mr. Walter Wyron to state his view of their friend's case.","Then Walter will get up, with his hands in the pockets of his knickers, and it will not be his fault if he does not get off an epigram or two of the ""Love is Law"" kind.",But you will not fail to notice that Walter is not his ordinary jaunty self.,"The withdrawal of Cosimo's support is going to hit him rather hard, and glances will be exchanged, and one or two will whisper behind their hands, ""Isn't Walter beginning to live a little on his reputation?""","Still, Walter will contribute his quotum.","We shall hear that, in his opinion, the Cause of Synthetic Protoplasm is making such vast strides to-day that we must revise every one of our estimates in the light of the most recent knowledge, having done which we shall probably find that what is really the matter with Amory is that, by comparison with the mechanical appliances of Loeb and Delage--appliances which he will take leave to call the Womb of the Workshop--their friend Amory is over-vitalized.",Then Mr. Wilkinson will spring to his feet.,And Mr. Wilkinson also will be more than a little sore about Cosimo's cowardly backsliding.,"He will say first of all that their Chairman, as usual, is talking out of his hat, and that anybody with a grain of sense knew that to know all was to have a contempt for all; and then he will point out that all the trouble had come of shillyshallying with the wrong policy.","Under Strong's direction of the ""Novum,"" he will say, Amory had been hitting the air to no purpose;

but she is not happy, and never will be again, because she has turned her back on her art; and Britomart Belchamber (who will be hoisted to her feet because she has lived in the same house with Amory, and may have something interesting and intimate to say) will doubt whether Amory has always quite closed the sweat-ducts with a cold sponge; and then the crowd will rush in--the governess playwrights will say what they think, the clerk sculptors what they think, and everybody else what he or she thinks--and presently they will have strayed a little from the business in hand, and will be discussing Cubism, or Matriarchy, or Toe-posts, or the Revival of the Ballad, or Rufty Tufty, quite beyond Mr. Brimby's power to hale them back to the proper subject.","And so the Meeting will have to be adjourned, and we shall all go again to-morrow night, when Mr. Wilkinson will be in the Chair, and there ought to be some fun---- But Edgar Strong will not be there, because he will be on the water, and Cosimo will not be there, because he will be anxiously counting what money remains to him, and Mr. Prang will not be there, because he will be under arrest in Bombay.","But, except for these absences, it will be a perfectly ripping Meeting----        *       *       *       *       * But none of these things were Dorothy's business.","Instead, by the time she had finished her questioning of Amory, there was no thought at all in her breast, save only the pitiful desire to help.","She saw before her an old young woman, more drained and disillusioned and with less to look forward to at thirty-odd than her aunt had at seventy.",Her very presence in Dorothy's house that night was a confession of it.,"It was the last house she would willingly have gone to, and yet there she was, begging Dorothy to tell her what had happened to her.","And there was nothing for Dorothy to say in reply....

Tasker had missed her way in the Tube.","She had been on, or rather under known ground on the Piccadilly Railway as far as Leicester Square, but after that she had not heard, or else had forgotten, that in order to get to Hampstead by the train into which she had stepped she must change at Camden Town.",Or perhaps she had merely wondered what Camden Town supposed itself to be that she should put herself to the trouble of changing there.,"With the newspaper held at arm's length, and a little figure-8-shaped gold glass moving slightly between her puckered old eyes and the page, she was reading the ""_By the Way_"" column of the ""Globe.""","--""All change,"" called the man at Highgate; and, still unconscious of her mistake, Lady Tasker left the train.",She was the last to enter the lift.,But for an unhurried raising of the little locket-shaped glass as the attendant fidgeted at the half-closed gate she might have been the first to enter the next lift.,Only from the policeman outside Highgate Station did she learn that she must either take the Tube back again to Camden Town or else walk across the Heath.,"Now Lady Tasker was seventy, and, with the exception of the Zoo, a place she visited from time to time with troops of turbulent great-nephews, the whole of North London was a sort of Camden Town to her, that is to say, she had no objection to its existence so long as it wasn't troublesome.","It was half-past three when she said as much to the Highgate policeman, who up to that time had been an ordinary easy-going Conservative; by five-and-twenty minutes to four she had made of him a fuming Radical.",He was saying something about South Square and Merton Lane.,"Lady Tasker addressed the bracing Highgate air in one of those expressionless and semi-ventriloquial asides that, especially in a mixed company, always made her ladyship very well worth sitting next to.","""Merton Lane!",Does the man suppose that conveys anything to me?....,"I want to know how to get to Hampstead, not the names of the objects of interest on the way!""","The newly-made Radical told her that there might be a taxi on the rank, and turned away to cuff the ears of an urchin who was tampering with an automatic machine.","It was a wonder that Lady Tasker's glare, focussed through the gold-rimmed glass on a point between his shoulder-blades, did not burn a hole in his tunic.","Taxis at eightpence a mile, indeed, with the house at Ludlow already full of those children of Churchill's, and three of Tony's little girls eating their way through the larder in Cromwell Gardens, and young Tommy, Emily's boy, who had just ""pulled"" his captaincy, arriving at Southampton in the ""Seringapatam"" on Saturday with another batch for her to take under her wing!",Did people suppose she was made of money?...,"The policeman's tunic was just beginning to scorch when Lady Tasker, dropping the glass, turned away and set out for Hampstead on foot.",She might very well have been excused had she omitted to return Mrs. Cosimo Pratt's call.,Indeed she had vowed that very morning that nothing should drag her up to Hampstead that day.,"But for twenty times that Lady Tasker said ""I will not,"" nineteen she repented and went, taking out the small change of her magnanimity when she got there.","And after all, she would be killing two birds with one stone, for her niece Dorothy also lived somewhere in this northern Great Karroo, and unless she got these things over before the ""Seringapatam"" dropped anchor on Saturday there was no knowing when next she would have an hour to call her own.","As she turned (after a brush with a second policeman, who summed her up quite wrongly on the strength of her antiquated pelisse and trailing old Victorian hat) down Merton Lane to the ponds, she told herself again that she was a foolish old woman to have come at all.",For the Cosimo Pratts were not bosom friends of hers.,"True, they had been, until six months ago, her neighbours at Ludlow, and for that matter she had known young Cosimo's people for the greater part of her life: but she had not forgotten the hearty blackguarding the young couple had got, any time this last two years, from the rest of the country-side.",Small wonder.,"What else did they expect, after the way in which they had made farm-labour too big for its jacket and beaters hardly to be had for love or money?",Not that Lady Tasker herself had seen very much of their antics.,"Great-nieces and nephews had kept her too busy for that, and she was moreover wise enough not to believe all she heard.","And even were it true, that, she now told herself, had been in the country.",They would have to behave differently now that they had let the Shropshire house and had come to live in town.,"They could hardly dance barefoot round a maypole in Hampstead, or stage-manage the yearly Hiring-Fair for the sake of the ""Daily Speculum"" photographer (as they had done in Ludlow), or group themselves picturesquely about the feet of the oldest inhabitant while that shocking old reprobate with the splendid head recited (at five shillings an hour) the stories of old, unhappy, far-off things he had learned by heart from the booklets they had printed at the Village Press.","No: in London they would almost certainly have to do as other people did, and Shropshire, after its three years of social and artistic awakening, would no doubt forget all about the æsthetic revival and would sink back into a well-earned rest.","It was a Thursday afternoon in September, warm for the time of the year, and a half-day closing for the shops.",Had Lady Tasker remembered the half-holiday she certainly would not have come.,"She hated crowds, and, if you would believe her, had no illusions whatever about the sanctity of our common nature and the brotherhood of man.","She would tell you roundly that there was far too much aimless good-nature in the world, and that every sob wasted over a sinner was something taken away from the man who, if he was a sinner too, had at least the decency to keep up appearances.",And so much for brotherhood.,"Great-nephewship, of course, was another matter.","Somebody had to look after all those youngsters, and if her sister Eliza, the one at Spurrs, went into a tantrum about every bud that was picked in the gardens and every chair-leg that was an inch out of its place in the house, so much the worse for Lady Tasker, who must walk because she had something else to do with her money than to waste it on taxis.","She had been told by her niece Dorothy to look out for a clump of tall willows and an ivied chimney; that was where the Pratts lived; but Dorothy had spoken of the approach from the Hampstead side, not from Highgate way.",Lady Tasker got lost.,"She was almost dropping for want of a cup of tea, and the Heath seemed all willows, and all the wrong ones.","No policeman, Radical or Conservative, was to be seen.","Walking across an apparently empty space, well away (as she thought) from a horde of shouting boys, the old lady suddenly found herself enveloped in a game of football.",This completed her exhaustion.,"Near by, one of Messrs. Libertys' carts was ascending a steep road at a slow walk; somehow or other Lady Tasker managed to get her hand on the tail of it; and the car gave her a tow.",She was seventy after all.,"As it happened, that was her first piece of luck in a luckless afternoon.",The cart drew on to the left; Lady Tasker trailed after it; and suddenly it stopped before a high privet hedge with a closed green door in the middle of it.,Lady Tasker did not look for the ivied chimney.,"On the door was painted in white letters ""The Witan.""",She was where she wanted to be.,"Ordinarily Lady Tasker would have approved of the height of the privet hedge, which was seven or eight feet; that was a nice, reassuring, anti-social height for a hedge; but as it was she could not even put up her hand to the bell.",The carter rang it for the pair of them.,"Over the hedge came the low murmur of voices and the clink of cups and saucers, and then the door was opened.",It was opened by the mistress of the house.,"No doubt Mrs. Pratt had expected the cart, had heard its drawing up, and had not waited for a maid to come.","Her eyes sought the carman, who had stepped aside.",She spoke with some asperity.,"""It's Libertys', isn't it?""",she said.,"""Well, I've a very good mind to make you take it back.","It was promised for yesterday.""","""Can't say, I'm sure, m'm.""","""It's always the same.","Every time I----"" Then she saw her visitor, and gave a little start.","""Why, it's Lady Tasker!",How delightful!,Do come in!,And do just excuse me--I shan't be a minute....

and either the studio ""properties"" were gradually thrusting the hatstand and hall table out of the fan-lighted front door, or else these latter ordinary and necessary objects were fighting as it were for admission.","Thus, the chair on which Lady Tasker sat was of oak, but it had a Faust-like look; beyond it stood a glass-fronted cupboard of bric-à-brac, with a trophy of Abyssinian armour hanging over it; and the whole of the wall facing Lady Tasker was hung with a tapestry which, if it had been the only one of its kind in existence, would no doubt have been very valuable.",And two other objects not commonly to be seen in ordinary halls were there.,One of these stood on the narrow gilt console table next to Lady Tasker's cup of tea.,"It was a plaster cast, taken from the life, of a female foot.",The other hung on the wall above it.,"This also was a plaster cast, of the whole of a female arm and shoulder, ending with a portion of the side of the neck and the entire breast--of its kind an exquisite specimen.","Many artists make or buy such things, but Brucciani has nothing half so beautiful.",It was as Lady Tasker finished her tea that her gaze fell on the two casts.,"Half negligently she raised her glass and inspected, first the foot, and then the other piece.","It is probable that her first remark, uttered in a casual undertone to the air about her, was prompted by mere association of ideas; it was ""Hm!","I wonder if Mrs. Pratt nursed those twins herself!""",Any other reflection that might have followed it was cut short by a sudden darkening of the doorway by which she had entered.,Mrs. Pratt stood there.,Lady Tasker had been wrong.,She _had_ come to ask if she felt better.,"She did ask her, gathering up long swathes of some newly unpacked white material she carried over her arm as she did so.","""Sorry you were done up,"" she remarked.","""Won't you have some more tea?""","Already Lady Tasker was rising.--""No more, thank you.--I was just looking at these.","What are they?""",She indicated the casts.,The gesture that Mrs. Pratt gave she could probably no more have helped giving than an eye can help winking when it is threatened with a blow.,Within one mistletoe-white sleeve an arm moved ever so slightly; very likely a foot also moved within a curiously-toed Saxon-looking white slipper; and she gave a confused and conscious and apologetic little laugh.,"""Oh, those silly things!""",she said deprecatingly.,"""I really must move them.","But the studio is so full.... Do you know, it's a most horrid feeling having them done--first the cold plaster poured on, and then, when they take it off again--the mould--you know----"" Lady Tasker plainly did not understand.","Perhaps she did not yet even apprehend.--""But--but--,"" she said, ""they're from a statue, aren't they?""",Again Mrs. Pratt gave the pleased bashful little laugh.,It was almost as if she said it was very good of Lady Tasker to say so.,"""No, they're from life,"" she said.","""As a matter of fact they're me, but I really must move them; they aren't so remarkable as all that.... Oh, you're not going, are you?----"" For Lady Tasker had given a jump, and a movement as sudden and sprightly as if she had only that moment got freshly out of her bed.","Nervously she put out her hand, while her hostess looked politely disappointed.","""Oh, and I was hoping you'd come and join us in the garden!","We've Brimby there, the novelist, you know--and Wilkinson, the young Member--and Mr. Strong, of the 'Novum'--and I should so much like to introduce Mr. Suwarree Prang to you----"" ""Oh, thank you so much--,"" sprang as effusively from Lady Tasker's lips as if she had been a schoolgirl allowed for the first time to come down to dinner, ""--it's so good of you, but really I half hoped you'd be out when I called--I only meant to leave cards--I'm going on to see my niece, and really haven't a moment----"" ""Oh, I'm sure Dorothy'd excuse you for once!----,"" Mrs. Pratt pressed her.","""Oh, she wouldn't--I'm quite sure she wouldn't--she'd never forgive me if she knew I'd been so near and hadn't called,"" said Lady Tasker feverishly.... ""How do I get to Dorothy's from here?""","""Oh, Mr. Wilkinson will take you, or Mr. Prang; but are you sure you won't stay?""",Lady Tasker was so far from staying that she was already out of the hall and walking quickly towards the green door in the eight-foot hedge.,"""Thank you, thank you so much,"" she was murmuring hurriedly.","""I don't see your husband anywhere about--never mind--so good of you--good-bye----"" ""Come again soon, won't you?""","""Yes, yes--oh, yes!...","No, no, please don't!""",(Mrs. Pratt had made a half-turn towards the hammock and the copper beech).,"""Straight across the Heath you said, didn't you?",I shall find it quite easily!,"Don't come any further--good-bye----"" And, touching Mrs. Cosimo Pratt's extended fingers as timorously as she might have touched those of the cast itself, she fairly broke into a run.",The door of The Witan closed behind her.,II THE POND-ROOM The truth was not very far to seek: Lady Tasker was too old for these things.,"Nobody could have expressed this more effectively than Mrs. Cosimo Pratt herself, had it entered the mind of Mrs. Pratt to conceive that any human soul could be so benighted as the soul of Lady Tasker was.","""Those casts!""","Mrs. Pratt might have cried in amazement--or rather Miss Amory Towers might have cried, for there is nothing in the Wedding Service about making over to your husband, along with your love and obedience, the valuable goodwill of a professional name.","""Those poor casts!...","Of course they may not be _very_ beautiful--,"" here the original of the casts might have modestly dropped her eyes, ""--but such as they are--goodness me!","How _can_ people be so prurient, Cosimo?","Don't they see that what they really prove has nothing at all to do with the casts, but--ahem!--a good deal to do with their own imaginations?","I don't want to use the word 'morbid,' but really!...","Well, thank goodness Corin and Bonniebell won't grow up like that!","Afraid of the beautiful, innocent human form!...","Now that's what I've always claimed, Cosimo--that that's the type of mind that's made all the mischief we've got to set right to-day.""",But for all that Lady Tasker was too old.,"Invisible Men in the garden (or, if not actually invisible, at any rate as hard to be seen against the leaves of the copper beech as a new penny would have been)--and in the hall those extraordinary replicas!",In the hall--the very forefront of the house!,"It was to be presumed that Mrs. Pratt's foreign friends, who were permitted to lean over her hammock, would not be denied The Witan itself, and, for all Lady Tasker knew, the rest of Mrs. Pratt might be reduplicated in plaster in the dining-room, the drawing-room, and elsewhere.... Had she not said it herself, Lady Tasker would never have believed it.... What a--what a--what an extraordinary thing!---- Lady Tasker had fled from The Witan still under the influence of that access of effusive schoolgirlishness in which she had told Mrs. Pratt that she really must go; nor did she grow up again all at once.","But little by little, as she walked, she began to resume the burden of her years.","She became eighteen, twenty-five, thirty again.","By the time she reached the lower pond Arthur had just got that billet in the India Office, and her brother Dick, of the Department of Woods and Forests, had married Ada Polperro, daughter of old Polperro of Delhi fame, and her sister Emily had got engaged to Tony Woodgate, of the Piffers.",(But those casts!)...,"Then as she took the path between the ponds she remembered the children at Ludlow, the three little girls at Cromwell Gardens, and the arrival on Saturday of the ""Seringapatam.""",(But those natives!)...,The thought of the children settled it.,Her curious lapse into juvenescence was over.,By the time she rang Dorothy's bell she was the same Lady Tasker who changed the political opinions of policemen and deprecated the wanderings of Saint Paul.,"Dorothy's flat was as different as it could well be from that other house which (Lady Tasker had already decided) had something odd and furtive about it--stagnant yet busy, segregated yet too wide open.",The flat had one really brilliant room.,This room did not merely overlook the pond in front of it; it seemed actually to have asked the pond to come inside.,"A large triple window occupied the whole of one end of it; this window faced west; and not only did the September sun shine brightly in, but the inverted sun in the water shone in also, doubling (yet also halving) all shadows, illumining the ceiling, and setting the cream walls a-ripple with the dancing of the wavelets outside.","Sprightly chintzes looked as if they also might begin to dance at any moment; the china in Dorothy's cupboards surprised the eye that had not expected this altered light; and presently, to complete the complexity, the shadow of the sycamore in the little garden below would move round, so that you would hardly be able to tell whether the ceaseless creeping on the cream walls was glitter of ripples, pattern of leaves, or both.","Dorothy sat in her accordion-pleats by the window, surrounded by letters.",And pray do not think it mere coincidence in this story that her letters were Indian letters.,"Some interests that the home-amateur takes up as he might take up poker-work or the diversion of jig-saw hold a large part of the hearts and lives of others, and so Dorothy, as she did more or less every week, had been reading her cousin Churchill's letter, and that of her little niece and namesake Dot, up in Murree, and Eva Woodgate's, who had sent her a parcel from Kohat, and others.","She rose slowly as her aunt was announced, and put her finger on the bell as she passed.","""How are you, auntie?""","she said, kissing Lady Tasker on both cheeks.","""Give me your things.","Somehow I thought you might come to-day, but I'd almost given you up.",Do look what Eva's sent me!,"Really, with her own to look after, I don't know how she finds the time!","Aren't they sweet!----"" And she held them up.",Now Lady Tasker knew perfectly well the meaning of her niece's accordion-pleating; but she was seventy and worldly-wise again now.,"Therefore as she looked at the things she remarked off-handedly, ""But they're far too small.""","""Too small!""",Dorothy exclaimed.,"""Of course they aren't.","Why, Noel was only nine, and that's pretty big, and Jackie only just over eight-and-a-half, though he put on weight while you watched him.","They're just right.""",Lady Tasker reached for a chair.,"""But they _are_ for Jackie, aren't they?""","Dorothy's blue eyes were as big as the plates in her cupboards.--""Jackie!","Good gracious, auntie!----"" ""Eh?""","said Lady Tasker, sitting down.","""Not Jackie?",Dear me.,How stupid of me.,"Of course, I did hear, but I've so many other things to think of, and nobody'd suppose, to look at you----"" Dorothy ran to her aunt and gave her a kiss and a hug, a loud kiss and a hug like two.","""You dear old thing!--Really, I'd begun to _hate_ all the horrid kind people who asked me how I felt to-day and whether I shouldn't be glad when it was over!",What business is it of theirs?,"I nearly made Stan sack Ruth last week, she looked so, and I positively refuse to have a young girl anywhere near me!...",But wasn't it sweet of Eva?,I'll give you some tea and then read you her letter.,"Indian or China?""","""China,"" Lady Tasker remarked.","""China, Ruth, and I'll have some more too.","I don't know whether His Impudence is coming in or not; he's gadding off somewhere, I expect....","But you weren't only _pretending_ just now, were you, auntie?----"" She put the plug of the spirit-kettle into the wall.","""Well, how are the Bits?""","Lady Tasker asked....

and whatever Mr. Strong's other failings might have been, nobody had ever said of him that he did not recognize a good thing when he saw it.",The Cause itself had served as an introduction between him and Cosimo; it had also been a sufficient reason for his inviting himself to Cosimo's house for a couple of days and remaining there for three weeks; and then he had got rid of the Van and had come again.,"He was a rapturous talker, when there was an end to be gained, and he had expressed himself as strongly of the opinion that, magnificent a field for the sowing of the good seed as the country-side was, there was simply stupendous propaganda to be done in London.","He knew (he had gone on) that Mrs. Pratt would forgive him (he had a searching blue eye and an actor's smile) if he appeared for a moment to speak disparagingly of what he might call the mere graces of the Movement, (alluring as these were in Mrs. Pratt's capable and very pretty hands); it was not disparagement really; he only meant that these garlands would burgeon a hundred-fold if the stern and thankless work was got out of the way first.","Mr. Strong had a valuable trick of suddenly making those searching blue eyes of his more searching, and of switching off the actor's smile altogether; both of these things had happened as he had gone on to point out that what the Cause was really languishing for was a serious and responsible organ; and then, and only then, when they had got (so to speak) the diapason, there would be time enough for the trills and appoggiaturas of the Hurdy-gurdy Band.","Before the end of Mr. Strong's second visit Cosimo had put up the greater part of the money for the ""Novum.""",So you see just where the feather-pated Stan was wrong.,The Cosimo Pratts were not outfaced from anything; they had merely seen a new and heralding light.,"They did not so much recede from the Rural Experiment, and discussions of the Suffrage, and eating buns on the floor at assemblies of the Poets' Club, and a hundred and twenty other such things, as become as it were translated.","They still shed over these activities the benignity of their approval, but from on high now.","Amory could no longer be expected actually to ""run"" the Suffrage Shop herself--Dickie Lemesurier did that; nor the ""Eden"" (the new offshoot off the Lettuce Grill)--that she left to Katie Deedes; nor the ""Lectures on Love"" Agency--that was quite safe in the hands of her friends, Walter Wyron and Laura Beamish.",Amory merely shed approval down.,She was _hors concours_.,She ... but you really must read Cosimo's book.,You will find it all there (or at any rate a good deal of it).,"For Amory Pratt, in so far as Cosimo was the proprietor of the ""Novum,"" was the proprietor of the proprietor of a high-class weekly review that was presently going to put the two older parties out of business entirely.",She had more than a Programme now; she had a Policy.,She had crossed the line into the _haute politique_.,"Her At Homes were already taking on the character of the political salon, and between herself and the wives of ministers and ambassadors were differences, in degree perhaps, but not in kind.","And that even these differences should become diminished she had taken on, ever since her settling-down at The Witan, slight, but significant, new attitudes and condescensions.",She was kinder and more gracious to her sometime equals than before.,"She gave them encouraging looks, as much as to say that they need not be afraid of her.","But it was quite definitely understood that when she took Mr. Strong apart under the copper beech or retired with him into the studio at the back of the house, she must on no account be disturbed.--Mr.","Strong, by the way, always dressed in the same Norfolk jacket, red tie and soft felt hat, and his first caution to Cosimo and Amory had been that Brimby, the novelist, was an excellent chap, but not always to be taken very seriously.","Amory did not often put in an appearance at the ""Novum's"" offices.","This was not that she thought it more befitting that Mr. Strong should wait on her, for she went about a good deal with Mr. Strong, and did not always trouble him to come up to The Witan to fetch her.","It was, rather, if the truth must be told, that she found the offices rather dingy.","Her senses loved the newly-machined smell of each new issue of the paper, but not the mingled odour of dust and stale gum and Virginia cigarettes of the place whence it came.","Moreover, the premises were rather difficult to find.",They lay at the back of Charing Cross Road.,"You dodged into an alley between a second-hand bookseller's and a shop where electric-light fittings were sold, entered a narrow yard, and, turning to the right into a gas-lighted cavern where were stacked hundreds and hundreds of sandwich-boards, some back-and-fronts, some with the iron forks for the bearer's shoulders, you ascended by means of a dark staircase to the second floor.","There, at the end of a passage which some poster-artist had half papered with the specimens of his art, you came upon the three rooms.","The first of these was the general office; the second was Mr. Strong's private office; and the third was a room which, the ""Novum"" having no need of it, Mr. Strong had thought he might as well use as a rent-free bedroom as not.",The door of this room Mr. Strong always kept locked.,It was more prudent.,"He was supposed to live somewhere in South Kentish Town, and gave this address to certain of his correspondents.","The letters of these reached him sooner or later, through the agency of a barber, in whose window was a placard, ""Letters may be addressed here.""","Perhaps, too, the extraordinary people who visited Mr. Strong in the way of business helped to keep Amory away.","For an endless succession of the queerest people came--contributors, and would-be contributors, and friends of the Cause who ""were just passing and thought they'd look in,"" and artists seeking a paper with the courage to print really stinging caricatures, and article-writers who were out of a job only because they dared to tell the truth about things, and Russian political exiles, and Armenians who wanted passages to America, and Eurasians who wanted rifles, and tramps, and poets, and the boy from the milkshop who brought in the bread and butter and eggs for Mr. Strong's breakfast.",And out of these strange elements had grown up the paper's literary style.,"This was unique in London journalism: philosophical, yet homely; horizon-wide of outlook, yet never without hope that the shining thing in the gutter might prove to be a jewel; and, despite its habitual omissions of the prefix ""Mr."" from the names of statesmen, and its playful allusions to this personage's nose or the waist-measurement of the other, with more than a little of the Revelation of Saint John the Divine about it.","""Damn"" and ""Hell"" were words the ""Novum"" commonly used.",Once Amory had demurred at the use of a word stronger still.,"But Mr. Strong had merely replied, ""If I can say it to you I think I can say it to them.""","He was no truckler to his proprietors, and anyhow, the man whom the word had encarnadined was only a colliery-owner.","The ""Novum"" had hardly been six weeks old when a certain desire on Amory's part to make experiment of her power had, putatively at any rate, lost it money.","The little collision of wills had come about over the question of whether the ""Novum"" should admit advertisements to its columns or not.","Now as most people know, that is a question that seldom arises in journalism.",A question far more likely to arise is whether the advertisements can be got.,"But when a journal sets out to do something that hitherto has not only not been done, but has not even been attempted, you will admit that the case is special.",The experience of other papers is useless; their economics do not apply.,"What did apply was the fact that Mrs. Pratt had been an artist, looked on sheets of paper from another angle than that of the mere journalist and literary man, and loved symmetry and could not endure unsightliness.","Besides, ""No Compromise"" was the ""Novum's"" motto, and what was the good of having a motto like that if you compromised in the very form of your expression?...","A ""shoulder-piece,"" ""_The Little Mary Emollient_,"" had brought out all Mrs. Pratt's finer artistic instincts.","Here was a journal consecrated to a great and revolutionary cause, and the very first thing to catch a reader's eye was, not only an advertisement, but a facetious advertisement at that--a Pill, without a Pill's robust familiarity--a commercial cackle issuing from the ""Novum's"" august and oracular mouth.... For the first time in her life Mrs. Pratt had wielded the blue pencil, tearing the rubbishy proof-paper in the energy with which she did so.","Mr. Strong's blue eyes, bluer for the contrast with his red knot of a tie, had watched her face, but he had said nothing.",He was willing to humour her....,"But when all was said and done he was an editor, and no sooner was Amory's back turned than he had restored the announcement.","The paper had appeared, and there had been a row....

none the less, Amory had conceived her friend to be of the number of those who play at hardship and independence with a fully spread table at home for them to return to when they are tired of the game.",But the case was entirely changed now.,"Amory frankly admitted that she had been mistaken in one thing, namely, that if those people of Dorothy's had more money, they had also more claims upon it, and so were relatively poor.",Amory herself was now very comfortably off indeed.,"By that virtue and good management which the envious call luck, she had now money, Cosimo's money, to devote to the regeneration of the world.","Dorothy, married to the good-tempered and shiftless Stan, sometimes did not know which way to turn for the overdue quarter's rent.","Now among her other ways of making ends meet Dorothy had for some years done rather well out of precisely that kind of work which Amory refused to allow the ""Novum"" to touch--advertisements.",She had wormed herself into the services of this firm and that as an advertisement-adviser.,"But her contracts had begun in course of time to lapse, one or two fluky successes had not been followed up, and two children had further tightened things.",Nor had Stan been of very much help.,Amory despised Stan.,"She thought him, not a man, but a mere mouth to be fed.","Real men, like Cosimo, always had money, and Amory was quite sure that, even if Cosimo had not inherited a fortune from his uncle, he would still have contrived to make himself the possessor of money in some other way.","Therefore Amory was even kinder to Dorothy than she was to Dickie Lemesurier of the Suffrage Shop, to Katie Deedes of the ""Eden,"" and to Laura Beamish and Walter Wyron, who ran the ""Lectures on Love.""","But somehow--it was a little difficult to say exactly how, but there it undoubtedly was--Dorothy did not accept her kindnesses in quite the proper spirit.","One or two she had even rejected--gently, Amory was bound to admit, but still a rejection.","For example, there had been that little rebuff (to call it by its worst name for a moment) about the governess.","Amory had, in Miss Britomart Belchamber, the most highly-qualified governess for Corin and Bonniebell that money and careful search had been able to obtain; Dorothy lived less than a quarter of an hour's walk away; it would have been just as easy for Britomart to teach four children as to teach two; but Dorothy had twisted and turned and had finally said that she had decided that she couldn't put Amory to the trouble.","And again, when the twins had had their party, Amory would positively have _liked_ Noel and Jackie to come and dance ""Twickenham Ferry"" in those spare costumes and to join in those songs from the Book of Caroline Ditties; but again an excuse had been made.","And half a dozen similar things had driven Amory to the conclusion, sadly against her will, that the Taskers were taking up that ridiculous, if not actually hostile attitude, of the poor who hug their pride.",It was not nice between old friends.,Amory could say with a clear conscience that she had not refused Dorothy's help in the days when the boot had been on the other leg.,"She was not resentful, but really it did look very much like putting on airs.",But of course that stupid Stanhope Tasker was at the bottom of it all.,Amory did not so much mind his not having liked her from the first; she would have been sorry to let a trifle like that ruffle her equanimity; but it was evident that he did not in the least realize his position.,"She was quite sure, in the first place, that he couldn't afford (or rather Dorothy couldn't afford) to pay eighty pounds for that flat, plus another twenty for the little office they had annexed and used as a nursery.",And in the next place he dressed absurdly above his position.,"Cosimo dressed for hygiene and comfort, in cellular things and things made of non-irritant vegetable fibre; but those absurdly modish jackets and morning-coats of Stan's had, unless Amory was very much mistaken, to be bought at the expense of real necessaries.",And so with their hospitality.,"In that too, they tried to cut a dash and came very near to making themselves ridiculous.","Amory didn't want to interfere; she couldn't plan and be wise for everybody; she had her own affairs to attend to; but she was quite sure that the Taskers would have done better to regulate their hospitality as hospitality was regulated at The Witan--that was, to make no special preparation, but to have the door always open to their friends.",But no; the Taskers must make a splash.,"They must needs ""invite"" people and be a little stand-offish about people coming uninvited.","They were ""At home"" and ""Not at home"" for all the world as if they had been important people.",But Amory would have thought herself very stupid to be taken in by all this ceremony.,"For example, the last time she and Cosimo had been asked to the flat to dinner she knew that they had been ""worked off"" only because the Taskers had had the pheasants given by somebody, and very likely the fish too.","And it would have been just like Stan Tasker's insolence had he asked them because he _knew_ that the Pratts did not eat poor beasties that should have been allowed to live because of their lovely plumes, nor the pretty speckled creatures that had done no harm to the destroyer who had taken them with a hook out of their pretty stream.","But, kind to her old friend as Amory was always ready to be, she did not feel herself called upon to go out of her way to be very nice to her friend's husband.","He had no right to expect it after his rudeness to Edgar Strong about the ""Novum.""","For it had been about the ""Novum"" that Stan had given Strong that talking-to.",Much right (Amory thought hotly) he had to talk!,"Just because he consorted with men who counted their money in rupees and thought nothing of shouldering their darker-skinned brothers off the pavement, he thought he was entitled to put an editor into his place!","But the truth, of course, was, that that very familiarity prevented him from really knowing anything about these questions at all.","Because an order was established, he had not imagination enough to see how it could have been anything different.","His mind (to give it that name) was of the hidebound, official type, and too many limited intelligences of that kind stopped the cause of Imperial progress to-day.","Or rather, they tried to stop it, and perhaps thought they were stopping it; but really, little as they suspected it, they were helping more than they knew.","A pig-headed administration does unconsciously help when, out of its own excesses, a divine discontent is bred.",Mr. Suwarree Prang had been eloquent on that very subject one afternoon not very long ago.,A charming man!,"Amory had listened from her hammock, rapt.","Mr. Prang did the ""Indian Review"" for the ""Novum,"" in flowery but earnest prose; and as he actually was Indian, and did not merely hobnob with a few captains and subalterns home on leave, it was to be supposed that he would know rather more of the subject than Mr. Stanhope Tasker!---- And Mr. Stanhope Tasker had had the cheek to tell Mr. Strong that he didn't know what he was talking about!",Amory felt that she could never be sufficiently thankful for the chance that had thrown Mr. Strong in her way.,"She had always secretly felt that her gifts were being wasted on such minor (but still useful) tasks as the ""Eden"" Restaurant and the ""Love Lectures"" Agency.",But her personal exaltation over Katie Deedes and the others had caused her no joy.,"What had given her joy had been the immensely enlarged sphere of her usefulness; that was it, not the odious vanity of leadership, but the calm and responsible envisaging of a task for which not one in ten thousand had the vision and courage and strength.",And Edgar Strong had shown her these things.,"Of course, if he had put them in these words she might have suspected him of trying to flatter her; but as a matter of fact he had not said a single word about it.",He had merely allowed her to see for herself.,That was his way: to all-but-prove a thing--to take it up to the very threshold of demonstration--and then apparently suddenly to lose interest in it.,And that in a way was his weakness as an editor.,"Amory, whom three or four wieldings of the blue pencil had sufficed to convince that there was nothing in journalism that an ordinary intelligence could not master in a month, realized this.","She herself, it went without saying, always saw at once exactly what Mr. Strong meant; she personally liked those abrupt and smiling stops that left Mr. Strong's meaning as it were hung up in the air; but it was a mistake to suppose that everybody was as clever as she and Mr. Strong.","""I's"" had to be dotted and ""t's"" crossed for the multitude.",But it was at that point that Mr. Strong always became almost languid.,"It was inevitable that the man who had thus revealed to her, after a single glance at her, such splendid and unsuspected capacities within herself, should exercise a powerful fascination over Amory.","If he had seen all this in her straight away (as he assured her he had), then he was a man not lightly to be let go.",He might be the man to show her even greater things yet.,"He puzzled her; but he appeared to understand her; and as both of them understood everybody else, she was aware of a challenge in his society that none other of her set afforded her.",He could even contradict her and go unsacked.,"Prudent people, when they sack, want to know what they are sacking, and Amory did not know.",Therefore Mr. Strong was quite sure of his job until she should find out.,"Another thing that gave Mr. Strong this apparently off-hand hold over her was the confidential manner in which he had warned her not to take Mr. Brimby, the novelist, too seriously.","For without the warning Amory, like a good many other people, might have committed precisely that error....","But when Mr. Brimby, taking Amory apart one day, had expressed in her ear a gentle doubt whether Mr. Strong was quite ""sound"" on certain important questions, Amory had suddenly seen.","Mr. Strong had ""cut"" one of Mr. Brimby's poignantly sorrowful sketches of the East End--seen through Balliol eyes--and Mr. Brimby was resentful.",She did not conceal from herself that he might even be a little envious of Mr. Strong's position.,"He might have been wiser to keep his envy to himself, for, while mere details of routine could hardly expect to get Amory's personal attention, there was one point on which Mr. Strong was quite ""sound"" enough for Amory--his sense of her own worth and of how that worth had hitherto been wasted.",And Mr. Strong had not been ill-natured about Mr. Brimby either.,He had merely twinkled and put Amory on her guard.,"And because he appeared to have been right in this instance, Amory was all the more disposed to believe in his rightness when he gave her a second warning.","This was about Wilkinson, the Labour Member.","He was awfully fond of dear old Wilkie, he said; he didn't know a man more capable in some things than Wilkie was; but it would be foolish to deny that he had his limitations.","He wasn't fluid enough; wanted things too much cut-and-dried; was a little inclined to mistake violence for strength; and of course the whole point about the ""Novum"" was that it was fluid.... ""In fact,"" Mr. Strong concluded, his wary blue eyes ceasing suddenly to hold Amory's brook-brown ones and taking a reflective flight past her head instead, ""for a paper like ours--I'm hazarding this, you understand, and keep my right to reconsider it--I'm not sure that a certain amount of fluidity isn't a Law...."" Amory nodded.",She thought it excellently put.,"IV THE STONE WALL Amory sometimes thought, when she took her bird's-eye-view of the numerous activities that found each its voice in its proper place in the columns of the ""Novum,"" that she would have allowed almost any of them to perish for lack of support rather than the Wyron's ""Lectures on Love.""","She admitted this to be a weakness in herself, a sneaking fondness, no more; but there it was--just that one blind spot that mars even the clearest and most piercing vision.",And she always smiled when Mr. Strong tried to show this weakness of hers in the light of a merit.,"""No, no,"" she always said, ""I don't defend it.","Twenty things are more important really, but I can't help it.","I suppose it's because we know all about Laura and Walter themselves.""","""Perhaps so,"" Mr. Strong would musingly concede.",Anybody who was anybody knew all about Laura Beamish and Walter Wyron and a certain noble defeat in their lives that was to be accounted as more than a hundred ordinary victories.,That almost historic episode had just shown everybody who was anybody what the world's standards were really worth.,"Hitherto the Wyrons have been spoken of both as a married couple and as ""Walter Wyron"" and ""Laura Beamish"" separately; let the slight ambiguity now be cleared up.","Mrs. Cosimo Pratt became on occasion Miss Amory Towers for reasons that began and ended in her profession as a painter; and everybody who was anybody was as well aware that Miss Amory Towers, the painter of the famous feminist picture ""Barrage,"" was in reality Mrs. Cosimo Pratt, as the great mass of people who were nobody knew that Miss Elizabeth Thompson, the painter of ""The Roll Call,"" was actually Lady Butler.",But not so with the Wyrons.,"Reasons, not of business, nor yet of fame, but of a burning and inextinguishable faith, had led to their noble equivocation.",Deeply seated in the hearts both of Walter and of Laura had lain a passionate non-acceptance of the merely parroted formula of the Wedding Service.,So searching and fundamental had this been that by the time their various objections had been disposed of little had remained that had seemed worth bothering about; and in one sense they had not bothered about it.,"True, in another sense they had bothered, and that was precisely where the defeat came in; but that did not dim the splendour of the attempt.","To come without further delay to the point, the Wyrons had married, under strong protest, in the ordinary everyday way, Laura submitting to the momentary indignity of a ring; but thereafter they had magnificently vindicated the New Movement (in that one aspect of it) by not saying a word about the ceremony of their marriage to anybody--no, not even to the people who were somebody.",Then they had flown off to the Latin Quarter.,"It had not been in the Latin Quarter, however, that the true character of their revolt had first shown.",Perhaps--nobody knows--their relation had not been singular enough there.,"Perhaps--there were people base enough to whisper this--they had feared the singularity of ""letting on.""",It is easy to do in the Boul' Mich' as the Boul' Mich' does.,The real difficulties begin when you try to do in London what London permits only as long as you do it covertly.,"And if there had been a certain covertness about their behaviour when, after a month, they had returned, what a venial and pardonable subterfuge, to what a tremendous end!","Amory herself, up to then, had not had a larger conception.","For while the Wyrons had secretly married simply and solely in order that their offspring should not lie under a stigma, their overt lives had been one impassioned and beautiful protest against any assumption whatever on the part of the world of a right to make rules for the generation that was to follow.","No less a gospel than this formed the substance of those Lectures of Walter's; great as the number of the born was, his mission was the protection of a greater number still.",The best aspects both of legitimacy and of illegitimacy were to be stereoscoped in the perfect birth.,"And he now had, in quite the strict sense of the word, a following.","The same devoted faces followed him from the Lecture at the Putney Baths on the Monday to that at the Caxton Hall on the Thursday, from his ascending the platform at the Hampstead Town Hall on the Tuesday to his addressing of a garden-party from under the copper-beech at The Witan on the Sunday afternoon.",And in course of time the faithfulness of the followers was rewarded.,"They graduated, so to speak, from the seats in the body of the building to the platform itself.","There they supported Laura, and gave her a countenance that she no longer needed (for she had earned her right to wear her wedding-ring openly now), and flocked about the lecturer afterwards, not as about a mere man, but rather as seeing in him the physician, the psychologist, the expert, the helper, and the setter of crooked things straight that he was.",As a lecturer--may we say as a prophet?--Walter had a manner original and taking in the extreme.,"Anybody less sustained by his vision and less upheld by his faith might have been a little tempted to put on ""side,"" but not so Walter.","Perhaps his familiarity with the stage--everybody knew his father, Herman Wyron, of the New Greek Theatre--had taught him the value of the large and simple statement of large and simple things; anyhow, he did not so much lecture to his audiences as accompany them, chattily and companionably, through the various windings of his subject.","With his hands thrust unaffectedly into the pockets of his knickers, and a sort of sublimated ""Well, here we are again"" expression on his face, he allayed his hearers' natural timidity before the magnitude of his mission, and gave them a direct and human confab.",on a subject that returned as it were from its cycle of vastness to simple personal experience again.,"His every sentence seemed to say, ""Don't be afraid; it's nothing really; soon you'll be as much at your ease in dealing with these things as I am; just let me tell you an anecdote.""",No wonder Laura held her long and muscular neck very straight above her hand-embroidered yoke.,"Everybody understood that unless she adopted some sort of an attitude her proper pride in such a married lover must show, which would have been rather rubbing it in to the rest of her sex.","So she booked dates for new lectures almost nonchalantly, and, when the platform was invaded at the end of the Lecture, or Walter stepped down to the level of those below, she was there in person as the final demonstration of how well these things actually would work as soon as Society had decided upon some concerted action.","Corin and Bonniebell, Amory's twins, did not attend Walter's Lectures.",It was not deemed advisable to keep them out of bed so late at night.,"But Miss Britomart Belchamber, the governess, could have passed--had in fact passed--an examination in them.","It had been Amory who, so to speak, had set the paper.","For it had been at one of the Lectures--the one on ""_The Future Race: Are We Making Manacles?_""--that Miss Belchamber had first impressed Amory favourably.","Amory had singled her out, first because she wore the guarantee of Prince Eadmond's Collegiate Institution--the leather-belted brown sleeveless djibbah with the garment of fine buff fabric showing beneath it as the fruit of a roasted chestnut shows when the rind splits--and secondly because of her admirable physique.","She was splendidly fair, straight as an athlete, and could shut up her long and massive limbs in a wicker chair like a clasp-knife; and for her movements alone it was almost a sin that Walter's father could not secure her for the New Greek Society's revival of ""Europa"" at the Choragus Theatre.",And she was not too quick mentally.,That is not to say that she was a fool.,"What made Amory sure that she was not a fool was that she herself was not instinctively attracted by fools, and it was better that Miss Belchamber should be ductile under the influence of Walter's ideas than that she should have just wit enough to ask those stupid and conventional and so-called ""practical"" questions that Walter always answered at the close of the evening as patiently as if he had never heard them before.","And Miss Belchamber told the twins stories, and danced ""Rufty Tufty,"" with them, and ""Catching of Quails,"" and was really cheap at her rather stiff salary.","Cosimo loved to watch her at ""Catching of Quails.""","If the children did not grow up with a love of beauty after that, he said, he gave it up.","(The twins, by the way, unconsciously served Amory as another example of Dorothy Tasker's unreasonableness.","As the mother of Noel and Jackie, Dorothy seemed rather to fancy herself as an experienced woman.",But Amory could afford to smile at this pretension.,There was a difference in age of a year and more between Noel and Jackie.,"No doubt Dorothy knew a little, but she, Amory, could have told her a thing or two).","On a Wednesday afternoon about a fortnight after Lady Tasker's visit to The Witan, Amory walked the garden thoughtfully.","The weather was growing chilly, the hammock had been taken in, and her feet in the fallen leaves made a melancholy sound.","Cosimo had left her half an hour before; certain points had struck him in the course of conversation which he thought ought to be incorporated in the ""_Life and Work_""; and it was a rule at The Witan that nothing must ever be allowed to interfere with the impulse of artistic creation.","For the matter of that, Amory herself was creating now, or at any rate was at the last preparatory stage that immediately precedes creation.","Presently she would have taken the plunge and would be deep in the new number of the ""Novum.""",For the moment she was thinking of Mr. Strong.,As she tried to clear up exactly what place Mr. Strong had in her thoughts she was struck by the dreadful tendency words and names and definitions have to attach themselves to vulgar and ready-made meanings--a tendency so strong that she had even caught herself more than once jumping to a common conclusion.,"To take an example, though a rather preposterous one.","Had Dorothy, with one of her ridiculous advertisements waiting to be done, confessed to her that instead of setting about it she was thinking of a male person with a pair of alert blue eyes and a curiously mobile and clean-cut mouth (not that it was likely that Dorothy would have had the candour to make such a confession)--well, Amory might have smiled just like anybody else.",She was not trying to make herself out any better than others.,"She was candid about it, however, which they were often not.","Still, the trouble about her feeling for Mr. Strong was to find a word for it that had not been vulgarized.","She was, of course, exceedingly interested in him, but that was not saying very much.","She ""liked"" him, too, but that again might mean anything.","Her difficulty was that she herself was so special; and so on second thoughts she might have been right in giving an interpretation to Dorothy's actions, and Dorothy quite wrong in giving the same interpretation to hers merely because the data were the same.","Nor had Mr. Strong himself been able to help her very much when, a couple of days before, she had put the question to him, earnestly and without hateful false shame.","""What _is_ this relation of ours?""","she had asked him, point-blank and fearlessly.","""Eh?""","Mr. Strong had replied, a little startled.","""There _must_ be a relation of some sort between every two people who come into contact.","I'm just wondering exactly what ours _is_.""","Then Mr. Strong had knitted his brows and had said, presently, ""I see.... Have you read '_The Tragic Comedians_?'""","--Amory had not, and the copy of the book which she had immediately ordered had not come yet.",And then she too had knitted her brows.,She had caught the trick from him.,"""I suppose that what it really comes to is knowing _yourself_,"" she had mused; and at that Mr. Strong had given her a quick approving look, almost as if he said that if she put in her thumb in the same place again she might pull out a plum very well worth having.","""And not,"" Amory had continued, curiously heartened, ""anything about the other person at all.""","""Good, good,"" Mr. Strong had applauded under his breath; ""have you Edward Carpenter's book in the house, by the way?...","Never mind: I'll send you my copy.""",He had sent it.,It was in Amory's hand now.,"She had discovered that it had a catching and not easily identifiable smell of its own, of Virginia cigarettes and damp and she knew not what else, all mingled; and somehow the smell seemed quite as much an answer to the question she had asked as anything in the book itself.","Nor, despite Walter's special knowledge of these indications, could she go to the Wyrons for diagnosis and advice.","For one thing, there was her own position of high patronage to be considered; for another, splendidly daring as the Wyrons' original protest had been, the Lectures had lately begun to have a little the air of a shop, over the counter of which admittedly valuable specifics were handed, but with a kind of ""_And_ the next article, please?""",suspicion about it.,"Besides, the Wyrons, having no children, had of necessity to ""chic"" a little in cases where children formed a complicating element.","Besides ... but anyway, Amory wasn't going either to Laura Beamish or to Walter Wyron.",She made a charming picture as she walked slowly the length of the privet hedge and then turned towards the copper beech again.,"Mr. Strong had said that he liked her in that dress--an aluminium-grey one, very simple and very expensive, worn with a handsome Indian shawl, a gift of Mr. Prang's, the mellow colour of which ""led up"" to the glowing casque of her hair; and she had smiled when Mr. Strong had added that Britomart Belchamber's rough tabards and the half-gym costume in which she danced ""Rufty Tufty"" would not have suited her, Amory, at all.",Probably they wouldn't--not as a regular thing.,"Cosimo liked those, especially when the wearer was largish; indeed, it was one of Cosimo's humours to pose as Britomart's admirer.","But Amory was small, and never shut her limbs up like a multiple-lever in a basket chair, but drew her skirt down a foot or so below her toes instead whenever she sat down.","She fancied, though Mr. Strong had never used the word, that the ""Novum's"" editor found Miss Belchamber just a little hoydenish.",Amory wished that something would bring Mr. Strong up that afternoon.,"It was one of the days on which the editing of the ""Novum"" could take care of itself, and besides, they would actually be editing it together.",For the next number but one--the forthcoming one was already passed--was to be their most important utterance yet.,"It was to indicate clearly, firmly and once for all, their Indian policy.","The threatened failure of the monsoon made the occasion urgent, and Mr. Suwarree Prang himself had explained to Amory only the night before precisely what the monsoon was, and how its failure would provide, from the point of view of those who held that the present wicked regime of administration by the strong hand was at last tottering to its fall, a providential opportunity.","It had struck Amory as wondrously romantic and strange that a meteorological condition half-way round the world, in a place she had never seen, should thus change the course of her quiet life in Hampstead; but, properly considered, no one thing in this wonderful world was more wonderful than another.","It was Life, and Life, as she remembered to have read somewhere or other, is for the Masters of it.",And she was beginning to find that after all these things only required a little confidence.,"It was as easy to swim in six miles deep of water, like that place in Cosimo's atlas of which the name escaped her for the moment, as it was in six feet.",And Mr. Prang had talked to her so long and so vividly about India that she sometimes found it quite difficult to realize that she had never been there.,"Still wishing that Mr. Strong would come, she slowly left the garden and entered the house.","In the hall she paused for a moment, and a tender little smile softened her face.",She had stopped before the exquisite casts of the foot and the arm.,"Pensively she took the foot up from the console table, and then, coming to a resolution, she took the arm down from its hook on the wall.","After all, beautiful as she had to admit them to be, the studio, and not the hall, was the proper place for them.","With the foot and Edward Carpenter in her left hand, and the plaster arm hugged to her right breast, she walked along the passage and sought the studio.","It was called the studio, and there certainly were canvases and easels and other artists' paraphernalia there, but it was less used for painting than as a room for sitting and smoking and tea and discussion.",It was a comfortable apartment.,"Rugs made islands on the thick cork floor-covering, and among the rugs were saddlebag chairs, a long adjustable chair, and a wide couch covered with faded tapestry.","The room was an annex of corrugated iron lined with matchboarding, but electric-light fittings depended from the iron ties overhead, and in place of an ordinary hearth was a sort of stage one, with an imitation log of asbestos, which, when you put a match to it, broke into a licking of blue and yellow gas-jets.","The north window occupied the whole of the garden end, and, facing it, was the large cartoon for Amory's unfinished allegorical picture, ""_The Triumph of Humane Government_.""",High up and just within the door was the bell that answered to the button outside.,Amory was putting down the casts on a Benares tray when the ringing of this bell startled her.,"But as it rang in the kitchen also, she did not move to answer it.","She stood listening, the fingers of one hand to her lips, those of the other still resting on the plaster shoulder.","Then she heard a voice, and a moment later there came a tap at the door.",It was Mr. Strong.,"He advanced, and did a thing he had not done before--lifted the hand she extended to his lips and then let it drop again.",But Amory was not surprised.,"It was merely a new and natural expression of the homage he had never concealed, and even had Amory been vain enough to suppose that it meant anything more, the briskness of the ""Good afternoon"" that followed it would have disabused her.","""Glad I found you,"" Mr. Strong said.","""I wanted to see you.","Cosimo in?""","Her husband was always Cosimo to him, but in speaking to herself he used no name at all.","It was as if he hesitated to call her Amory, and refused to call her Mrs. Pratt.","Even ""Miss Towers"" he had only used once, and that was some time ago.","Amory's fingers left the cast, and Mr. Strong walked towards the asbestos log.--""May I?""","he said, drawing forth a packet of Virginia cigarettes;

but it was not true, as an unkind visitor who had been once only to The Witan had said, that they were everybody's children.","Just because Amory had taken Katie Deedes' advice and had had their hair chopped off short at the nape like a Boutet de Monvel drawing--and had not disdained to accept the spelling-books which Dickie Lemesurier had given them (books in which the difficult abstraction of the letter ""A"" was visualized for their young eyes as ""Little Brown Brother,"" ""B"" as ""Tabby Cat,"" and so on)--and had listened to Mr. Brimby when he had said what a good thing it would be to devote an hour on Friday afternoons to the study of Altruism and Camaraderie--and, in a word, had not been too proud and egotistical to make use of a good suggestion wherever she found it--because she had done these things, it did not at all follow that she had shirked her duties.","If she did not influence them directly, having other things to do, she influenced those who did influence them, which came to the same thing.","She influenced the Wyrons, for example, and nobody could say that the Wyrons had not made a particularly careful study of children.","They had, and Walter had founded at least two Lectures directly on the twins and their education.","But the Wyrons, who had submitted to the indignity of marriage for the sake of the race, laboured and lectured under an obvious disadvantage; they had no children of their own.",And so Amory had to fill up the gaps in their experience for herself.,"Still, it was wonderful how frequently the Wyrons' excogitations and the things Amory had found out for herself coincided.","They were in absolute accord, for example, about the promise of the immediate future and the hope that lay in the generation to come.",The Past was dead and damned; the Present at best was an ignoble compromise; but the Morrow was to be bright and shining.,"""Walter and I,"" Laura sometimes said sadly, ""aren't anything to brag about.",There is much of the base in us.,Our lives aren't what they should be.,We're in the grip of inherited instincts too.,"We strive for the best, but the worst's sometimes too much for us.",It's like Moses seeing the Promised Land from afar.,We're just in the position of Moses.,"But these young Aarons----"" Amory thought that very modest and dignified of poor old Laura.","She frequently thought of her as 'poor old Laura,' but of course she didn't mean her actual age, which was only two years more than Amory's own.","And that was very good, if a little sad, about Moses.",The Wyrons did look forth over a Canaan they weren't very likely ever to tread.,"Lately--that is to say since that secret and tremendous moment between herself and Edgar Strong in the studio--Amory had fallen into the habit of musing long over the sight of the twins at lessons, at play, or at that more enlightened combination that makes lessons play and play lessons.","Sometimes Mr. Brimby, the novelist, had come up to her as she had mused and had asked her what she was thinking about.","""Your little Pigeon Pair, eh?""",he had said.,"""Ah, the sweetness; ah, lucky mother!","Grey books have to be the children of some of us; ah, me; yours is a pleasanter path!""",Then he would fondle the little round topiary trees of their heads.,Amory was almost as sorry for Mr. Brimby as she was for Laura.,"His books sold only moderately well, and she had more than once thought she would like the ""Novum"" to serialize one of them--the one with the little boy rather like Corin and the little girl rather like Bonniebell in it--if Mr. Brimby didn't want too much money for it.","Edgar Strong, on the other hand, never fondled the children, and Amory's heart told her why.",How could he be expected to do anything but hate those poor innocents who had come between him and his desire?,He must have realized that only the twins had frustrated that flight to Paris.,Of course he was polite about it; he said that he was not very fond of children at all; but Amory was not deceived.,"She was, in a way, flattered that he did not fondle them.",It was such an eloquent abstention.,But it would have been more eloquent still had he come to The Witan and not-fondled them oftener.,"Therefore it was that Amory looked on Corin and Bonniebell as the precious repositories of her own relinquished joys, and heirs to a happier life than she herself had known.",She dreamed over them and their future.,Laura Wyron was quite right: by the time they had grown up the fogs of cowardice and prejudice and self-seeking would have disappeared for ever.,"Perhaps even by that time, as in Heaven, there would be no more marrying nor giving in marriage.",Things would have adjusted themselves out of the rarer and sweeter and more liberal atmosphere.,"Corin, grown to be twenty, would one day meet with some mite who was still in her cradle or not yet born, and the two would look at one another with amazement and delight, and the Ideal Love would be born in their eyes, and Corin would recite a few of those brave and pure and unashamed things out of ""Leaves of Grass"" to her, and--well, and there they would be.... And Bonniebell, too, would do the same, on a Spring morning very likely, simply clad, cool and without immodest blushes--yes, she too would see somebody, and she would say, gladly and simply, ""I am here"" (for there would be no reason, then, why she should wait for the youth to speak first), and--well, and there they would be too.","And it would be Exogamy, or whatever the word was that Walter used.","Either would go forth from the family on the appointed day--or perhaps only Corin would go, and Bonniebell remain behind--but anyway, one, if not both of them would go forth, and rove the morning-flushed hills, alone and free and singing and on the look-out for somebody, and they would look just like pictures of young Greeks, and nobody would laugh, as they did at the poor lady who walked in Greek robes down the Strand.... And Amory herself?",Alas!,She would be left with the tribe.,She would be old then--say fifty-something on the eleventh of October.,And Edgar would be old too.,They would have to recognize that _their_ youth had been spent in the night-time of ignorance and suspicion.,"_They_ would only be able to think of those spirited young things quoting ""Leaves of Grass"" to one another and wondering what had happened to them.... No wonder Amory was sometimes pensive.... Mr. Wilkinson, the Labour Member, had been to all intents and purposes asked not to fondle the twins.","He was a tall spare man with a great bush of pepper-and-salt hair, a Yorkshire accent, and an eye that hardly rested on any single object long enough to get more than a fleeting visual impression of it.","He wrote on the first and third weeks of the month the ""Novum's"" column of ""Military Notes,"" and on the alternate weeks filled the same column with officially inspired ""Trade Union Echoes.""",Between these two activities of Mr. Wilkinson's there was a connexion.,"He, in common with everybody else at The Witan, was loud in decrying the jobberies and vested interests of Departments, with the War Office placed foremost in the shock of his wrath.","But the Trade Unions were another matter, and never a billet-creating measure came before Parliament but he strove vehemently to have its wheels cogged in with those of the existing Trade Union machine.","That is to say, that while in theory he was for democratic competitive examination, in practice he found something to be said for jobbery, could the fitting Trade Unionist but be found.","He was, moreover, a firebrand by temperament, and this is where the connexion between the ""Military Matters"" and the ""Echoes"" appears.","Trade Unionists he declared, ought to learn to shoot.","The other side, with their cant about ""Law and Order,"" never hesitated to call out the regular troops; therefore, until the Army itself should have been won over by means of the leaflets that were disseminated for the purpose, they ought in the event of a strike to be prepared to throw up barricades, to shoot from cellar-windows, and to throw down chimney-stacks from the housetops.","Capitalist-employed troops would not destroy more property than they need; in a crooked-streeted town the advantage of long-range fire would be gone; and Mr. Wilkinson was prepared to demonstrate that a town defended on his lines could hold out, in the event of Industrial War pushed to an extreme, until it was starved into surrender.--These arguments, by the way, had impressed Mr. Prang profoundly.","Now (to come back to the twins) on Corin's fourth birthday Mr. Wilkinson, moved by these considerations, had given him a wooden gun, and in doing so had committed a double error in Amory's eyes.","His first mistake had been to suppose that even if, under the present lamentable (but nevertheless existing) conditions of militarism, Corin should ever become a soldier at all, he would be the uncommissioned bearer of a gun and not the commissioned bearer of a sword.","And his second mistake had been like unto it, namely, to think that, in the case of a proletariat uprising say in Cardiff or York, Corin would not similarly have held some post of weight and responsibility on the other side.",Corin shoot up through the street-trap of a coal-hole or pot somebody from behind a chimney-stack!...,But Amory admitted that it must be difficult for Mr. Wilkinson to shake off the effects of his upbringing.,"That upbringing had been very different from, say, Mr. Brimby's.","Mr. Brimby had been at Oxford, and in nobly stooping to help the oppressed brought as it were a fragrant whiff of graciousness and culture with him.",Mr. Wilkinson was a nobody.,"He came from the stratum of need, and, when it came to fondling the twins, must not think himself a Brimby....","Therefore, Amory had had to ask him to take the gun back (a deprivation which had provoked a mighty outcry from Corin), and to give him, if he must give him something, a Nature book instead.","Katie Deedes and Dickie Lemesurier were both permitted to fondle the twins, though in somewhat different measure.",This difference of measure did not mean that either Katie or Dickie suffered from a chronic cold that the twins might have contracted.,Here again the case was almost as complicated as the case of Mr. Wilkinson.,Cases had a way of being complicated at The Witan.,"It was this:-- Both of these ladies, as Amory had assured Mr. Brimby, were ""quite all right.""",She meant socially.,No such difference was to be found between them in this respect as that which yawned between Mr. Brimby and Mr. Wilkinson.,"Indeed as far as Dickie was concerned, Amory had given a little apologetic laugh at the idea of her having to place and appraise a Lemesurier of Bath at all.","The two girls had equally to work for their living, and--but perhaps it was here that the difference came in.",There are jobs and jobs.,It was a question of tone.,"Dickie, running the Suffrage Book Shop, enjoyed something of the glamour of Letters; but Katie, as manageress of the Eden Restaurant, was, after all, only a caterer.",It was not Amory's fault that Romance had pronounced arbitrarily and a little harshly on the relative dignity of these occupations.,"She could not help it that books are books and superior, while baked beans are only baked beans, necessary, but not to be talked about.","If Dickie had, by her calling, a shade more consideration than was strictly her due, while Katie, by hers, was slightly shorn of something to which she would otherwise have been entitled, well, it was not Amory who had arranged it so.",But between books and baked beans the twins did not hesitate for an instant.,They saw from no point of view but their unromantic own.,"Dickie, overhauling the remainder stock at the Suffrage Shop, was able to bring them a book from time to time; but Katie, whose days were spent in a really interesting place full of things to eat, brought them sweetened Proteids, and cold roasted chestnuts, and sugared Filbertine, and sometimes a pot of the Eden Non-Neuritic Honey for tea.","And because the flesh was stronger in them than Amory thought it ought to be (at any rate until the day should come when they must leave the tribe with a copy of ""Leaves of Grass"" in their hands), they adored Katie and thought very much less of Dickie.","Now this belly-guided preference was a thing to be checked in them; and one day Amory had asked Katie (quite nicely and gently) whether she would mind _not_ bringing the children things that spoiled their appetites, not to speak of their tempers when they clamoured for these comestibles at times when they were not to be had.","Then, one afternoon in the nursery, Amory actually had to repeat her request.","Half an hour later, when the children had been brought down into the studio for their after-tea hour, she learned that Katie had left the house.",It was Corin himself who informed her of this.,"""Auntie Katie was crying,"" he said.","""About the vertisements,"" he added.","""_Ad_-vertisements, dear,"" Amory corrected him.","""Say _ad_-vertisements, not vertisements.""","""_Ad_-vertisements,"" said Corin sulkily.","""But--"" and he cheered up again, ""--she _was_, mother.""","""Nonsense,"" said Amory.","""And you're not to say 'Auntie' to Katie.",It isn't true.,"Your Auntie is your father's or your mother's sister, and we haven't any....

(To jump forward a little: Katie did elect to sulk.","Or rather, she did worse.",She was so ill-advised as to go behind Amory's back and to speak to Cosimo himself about the advertisements.,With that Katie's goose--or perhaps one should say her Anserine--was cooked.,Amory did not allow that kind of thing.,She certainly did not intend to explain anything after that.,It was plain as a pikestaff that Katie was jealous of Dickie.,Amory was bitterly disappointed in Katie.,Of course she would not forbid her the house; she was still free to come to The Witan whenever she liked; but--somehow Katie only came once more.,"She found herself treated so very, very kindly....","So she gulped down a sob, fondled the twins once more, and left).",Miss Britomart Belchamber saw enough of the twins not to wish to fondle them very much.,"Amory was not yet absolutely sure that she fondled Cosimo instead, but she was welcome to do so if she could find any satisfaction in it.",Cosimo fondled the twins to a foolish extreme.,Mr. Prang could never get near enough to them to fondle them.,"Both Corin and Bonniebell displayed a most powerful interest in Mr. Prang, and would have stood stock-still gazing at him for an hour had they been permitted; but the moment he approached them they fled bellowing.","And in addition to these various fondlings there were casual fondlings from time to time whenever the more favoured of the ""Novum's"" contributors were asked to tea.","But the Wyrons remained, so to speak, the _ex-officio_ fondlers, and perhaps childless Laura felt a real need to fondle at her heart.","It was she who first asked Amory whether she hadn't noticed that, while Mr. Brimby and Dickie frequently fondled the twins separately, more frequently still they did so together.","""No!""",Amory exclaimed.,"""I hadn't noticed!""","""Walter thinks they would be a perfect pair,"" Laura mused.... II THE 'VERT Stan saw very little in the scheme that Dorothy darkly meditated against her aunt.",He seldom saw much in Dorothy's schemes.,"Perhaps she did not make quite enough fuss about them, but went on so quietly maturing them that her income seemed to be merely something that happened in some not fully explained but quite natural order of events.","Stan thought it rather a lucky chance that the money usually had come in when it was wanted, that was all.",But of his own job he had quite a different conception.,_That_ took thought.,This appeared plainly now that he was able to dismiss his own past failures with a light and almost derisive laugh.,"""I don't know whatever made me think there was anything in them,"" he said complacently one night within about ten days of Christmas.","He had put on his slippers and his pipe, and was drowsily stretching himself after a particularly hard ""comic film"" day, in the course of which he had been required to fall through a number of ceilings, bringing the furniture with him in his downward flight.","He had come home, had had a shampoo and a hot bath, and the last traces of the bags of flour and the sacks of soot had disappeared.","""I don't think now they'd ever have come to very much.""","""Hush a moment,"" said Dorothy, listening, her needle arrested half-way through the heel of one of his socks....

She loved this change in him which a real job with real money had brought about.","Poor old darling, she thought, it must have been pretty rotten for him before, borrowing half-crowns from her in the morning, which he would spend with an affected indifference on drinks and cab fares in the evening.",And he _should_ speak with a new authority if he wished.,Not for worlds would she have smiled at His Impudence's new air of being master in his own house.,He _should_ be a Sultan if he liked--provided he didn't want more than one wife.,"Moreover, his bringing in of money had been a relief so great that even yet she had hardly got out of the habit of reckoning on her own earnings only.","It had taken her weeks to realize that now the twopences came in just a little more quickly than they went out, and that she could actually afford herself the luxury of keeping Mr. Miller waiting for his Idea, or even of not giving it to him at all.",She really had no Idea to give him.,She was entirely wrapped up now in her plot against Lady Tasker.,"That plot, summarized from several conversations with Stan, was as follows:-- ""You see, there's the Brear, with all that land, Aunt Grace's very own.","The Cromwell Gardens lease is up in June, and it's all very well for auntie to say she doesn't hate London, but she does.","She spends half a rent, with one and another of them, in travelling backwards and forwards, and she's getting old, too.--Then there's us.","We can't go on living here, and the Tonys will be home just as Tim's leave's up, and they're sure to leave their Bits behind.",Very well.,"Now the Tims and the Tonys can't afford to pay much, but they can afford something, and I think they ought to pay.","They're sure to want those boys to go into the Army, and they'd _have_ to pay for that anyway.--So there ought to be a properly-managed Hostel sort of place, paying its way, and a fund accumulating, and Aunt Gracie at the head of it, poor old dear, but somebody to do the work for her.--I don't see why we shouldn't clear out that old billiard-table that nobody ever uses, and throw that and the gun-room into one, and make that the schoolroom, and have a proper person down--a sort of private preparatory school for Sandhurst and Woolwich, and the money put by to help with the fees afterwards.",It would be much easier if we all clubbed together.,"And I should jolly well make Aunt Eliza give us at least a thousand pounds--selfish old thing.""","""Frightful rows there'd be,"" Stan usually commented, thinking less of Dorothy's plan than of his own last trick-tumble.","""Like putting brothers into the same regiment; always a mistake.","And we're all rather good at rows you know.""","""Well, they're our _own_ rows anyway.",We keep 'em to ourselves.,And we _do_ all mean pretty much the same thing when all's said.,"I'm going to work it all out anyway, and then tackle Aunt Grace.... _I_ shall manage it, of course.""",She did not add that her Lennards and Taskers and Woodgates would sink their private squabbles precisely in proportion as the outside attacks on their common belief rendered a closing-up of the ranks necessary.,"But she _had_ been to The Witan and had kept her eyes open there, and knew that there were plenty of other Witans about.","If stupid Parliament, with its votes and what not, couldn't think of anything to do about it, that was no reason why she should not do something, and make stingy old Aunt Eliza pay for the training of her Bits into the bargain.","She had not seen Amory since that day when the episode of the winter woollies had made her angry, for, though Amory had called once at the Nursing Home soon after the birth of the third Bit, Dorothy had really not felt equal to the hair-raising tale of the twins all over again, and had sent a message down to her by the nurse.","There was this difference between this tragic recital of Amory's and the fervour with which Ruth Mossop always hugged to her breast the thought of the worst that could happen--that Ruth _had_ known brutality, and so might be forgiven for getting ""a little of her own back""; but Amory had known one hardish twelvemonths perhaps, a good many years ago and when she had been quite able to bear it, and had since magnified that period of discomfort by a good many diameters.","Amory, Dorothy considered, didn't really know she was born.",She was unfeignedly sorry for that.,Whatever measure of contempt was in her she kept for Cosimo.,For she considered that Cosimo was at the bottom of all the trouble.,"If Stan, at his most impecunious and happy-go-lucky, could still stalk about the house saying ""Dot, I won't have this,"" or ""Look here, Dorothy, that has got to stop,"" it seemed to her that Cosimo, with never a care on his mind that was not his own manufacture, might several times have prevented Amory from making rather a fool of herself.",But it seemed to Dorothy that kind of man was springing up all over the place nowadays.,Mr. Brimby was another of them.,"Dorothy had read one of Mr. Brimby's books--""_The Source_,"" and hadn't liked it.",She had thought it terribly dismal.,"In it a pretty and rich young widow, who might almost have been Amory herself, went slumming, and spent a lot of money in starting a sort of Model Pawn Shop, and by and by there came a mysterious falling-off in her income, and she went to see her lawyer about it, and learned, of course, that her source of income was that very slum in which she had stooped to labour so angelically.... Dorothy didn't know very much about pawnshops, but then she didn't believe that Mr. Brimby did either; and if her interest in them ever should become really keen, she didn't think she should go to Oxford for information about them.","And Mr. Brimby himself seemed to feel this ""crab,"" as Stan would have called it, for after ""_The Source_"" he had written a Preface for a book by a real and genuine tramp.... And it had been Amory who had recommended ""_The Source_"" to Dorothy.","She had said that it just showed, that with vision and thought and heart and no previous experience (""no prejudice"" had been her exact words), there need be none of these dreadful grimy establishments, with their horrible underbred assistants who refused a poor woman half a crown on her mattress and made a joke about it, but airy and hygienic rooms instead, with rounded corners so that the dust could be swept away in two minutes (leaving a balance of at least twenty-eight minutes in which the sweeper might improve himself), and really courtly-mannered attendants, full of half crowns and pity and Oxford voice, who would give everybody twice as much as they asked for and a tear into the bargain.",And Amory knew just as much about real pawnshops as did Dorothy and Mr. Brimby.,For the life of her Dorothy could not make out what all these people were up to.,And--though this was better now that Stan was earning--the thought of the money that was being squandered at The Witan had sometimes made her ready to cry.,"For at the Nursing Home she had had one other visitor, and this visitor had opened her eyes to the appalling rate at which Cosimo's inheritance must be going.",This visitor had been Katie Deedes.,"Katie too, was an old fellow-student of Dorothy's; it had not taken Dorothy long to see that Katie was full of a grievance; and then it had all come out.",There had been some sort of a row.,It had been simply and solely because Katie ran a Food Shop.,Amory thought that _infra dig_.,And just because Katie had given the children a few chestnuts Amory had practically said so.,"""_I_ shan't go there again,"" Katie had said, trying on Dorothy's account to keep down her tears.","""_I_ didn't marry a man with lots of money, and turn him round my finger, and make him write my _Life and Works_, and then snub my old friends!",And none of the people who go there are really what she thinks they are.,"_She_ thinks they go to see _her_, but Mr. Brimby only goes because Dickie does, and because he wants to sell the 'Novum' something or other, and Mr. Strong of course has to go, and Mr. Wilkinson goes because he wants Cosimo to stop the 'Novum' and start something else with him as editor, and Laura goes because they get things printed about Walter's Lectures, and I don't know what those Indians are doing there at all, and anyway _I've_ been for the last time!","I'm just as good as she is, and I should like to come and see you instead, Dorothy, and of course I won't bring your babies chestnuts if you don't want....","But I'm frightfully selfish; I'm tiring you out....

another had been that suspended state of affairs between herself and Mr. Strong.,"The first of these curtailed a good deal of the philosophy in which Mr. Strong always seemed anxious to enwrap the subject (in order, as far as Amory could see, to avoid action).","It also made a little more of the position of women, white, black or brown, and especially when rolled up in carpets, in Imperial affairs.","And the second, that hung-up relation between Edgar Strong and herself, had left her constantly wondering what would have happened had she taken Mr. Strong at his word and fled to Paris with him, and exactly where they stood since she had not done so.","For naturally, things could hardly have been expected to be the same after that.","Since Edgar had ceased to come quite so frequently to The Witan, Amory had thought the whole situation carefully over and had come to her conclusion.","Perhaps the histories of _les grandes maitresses_ and the writings of Key had helped her; or, more likely, Key in Sweden (or wherever it was) and herself in England had arrived at the same conclusion by independent paths.","That conclusion, stated in three words, was the Genius of Love.",It was perfectly simple.,"Why had Amory Towers, the painter of that picture (""Barrage"") so enthusiastically acclaimed by the whole of Feminist England, now for so long ceased to paint?",What had become of the Genius that had brought that picture into being?,It is certain that Genius cannot be stifled.,"Deny it one opportunity and it will break out somewhere else--in another art, in politics, in leadership in one form or another, or it may be even in crime.","Even so, Amory was conscious, her own Genius had refused to be suppressed.","It had found another outlet in politics, directed in a recumbent attitude from a sofa.","Yet that had landed her straightway in a dilemma--the dilemma of Edgar and the twins, of Paris on seven francs a day and the comforts Cosimo allowed her, of a deed that was to have put even that of the Wyrons into the shade and a mere settling down to the prospect of seeing Edgar when it pleased him to put in an appearance.",She had not seen this protean property of Genius just at first.,That could only have been because she had not examined herself sufficiently.,"She had been introspective, but not introspective enough.","And lest she should be mistaken in the mighty changes that were going on within herself, at first she had tried the painting again.","Her tubes were dry and her brushes hard, but she had got new ones, and one after another she had taken up her old half-finished canvases again.","A single glance at them had filled her with astonishment at the leagues of progress, mental and emotional, that she had made since then.",She had laughed almost insultingly at those former attempts.,"That large canvas on the ""_Triumph of Humane Government_"" was positively frigid!",And Edgar had liked it!...,"Well, that only showed what a power she now had over Edgar if she only cared to use it.","If he had liked that chilly piece of classicism, he would stand dumb before the canvas that every faculty in her was now straining to paint.",She began to think that canvas out....,"It must be Eastern, of course;

And above all, she must get _herself_ into it--the whole of herself--all that tremendous continent that Cosimo had not had, that her children had not had, that her former painting had left unexpressed, that politics had not brought out of her....",The result of that experiment was remarkable.,Two days later she had thrown the painting aside again.,It was a ghastly failure.,But only for a moment did that depress her; the next moment she had seen further.,She was a Genius; she knew it--felt it; she was so sure about it that she would never have dreamed of arguing about it; she had such thoughts sometimes....

she was looking, and yet not looking, for Edgar Strong now.",Had she met him she had nothing new to say to him; she only knew that he had taken weak possession of her mind.,"She was looking for him in South Kensington because he had once told her, when asked suddenly, that he lived in Sydney Street, S.W., and frequently walked to the Indian section of the Imperial Institute in order to penetrate into the real soul of a people through its art; and she was not looking for him, because one day she had remembered that he had said before that he lived in South Kentish Town--which was rather like South Kensington, but not the same--and something deep down within her told her that the other was a lie.","But yet her feet dragged her to the quarter, as to other quarters, and she talked to herself as she walked.","She told herself that her husband did not understand her, and that it would be romantic and silencing did she take a lover to her arms; and she could have wept that, of all the flagrant splendours of which she dreamed, London's grey should remain her only share.",And she knew that the attendants at the Imperial Institute had begun to look at her.,"Once she had spoken to one of them, but when she had thought of asking him whether he knew a Mr. Strong who came there to study Indian Art, her heart had suddenly failed her, and the question had stayed unspoken.","Nevertheless she had feared that the man had guessed her thought, and must be taking stock of her face against some contingency (to visualize which passed the heavy time on) that had a Divorce Court in it, and hotel porters and chambermaids who gave evidence, and the Channel boat, and two forsaken children, and grimy raptures in the Latin Quarter, and its hectic cafés at night.... And so she walked, feeling herself special and strange and frightened and half-resolved; and thrice in as many weeks Lady Tasker, sitting with her crochet at her window, had seen her pass, but had not been able to believe that this was the woman, with a husband and children, on whom she had once called at that house with the secretive privet hedge away in Hampstead.","*       *       *       *       * ""It _is_ Amory!""",Dorothy exclaimed.,"""Is she coming here?""","Lady Tasker spoke reflectively.--""I don't know.",I don't think so.,But--will you fetch her in?,"I should like to see her.""","""If you like, auntie,"" said Dorothy, though a little reluctantly.",But Lady Tasker seemed to change her mind.,She laid down her crochet and rose.,"""No, never mind,"" she said.","""I'll fetch her myself.""","And the old lady of seventy passed slowly out of the room, and Katie and Dorothy moved away from the window.","Lady Tasker was back again in five minutes, but no Amory came with her.","She walked back to her chair, moved it, and took up her work again.--""Switch the table light on,"" she said.","""Was it Amory?""",Dorothy ventured to ask after a silence.,"""Yes,"" Lady Tasker replied.","""And wouldn't she come in?""","""She said she was hurrying back home.""",That raised a question so plain that Dorothy thought it tactful to make rather a fuss about finding some album or other that should convince Katie that she really had met the Mollie who had written the letter about the window-curtains.,Lady Tasker's needle was dancing rather more quickly than usual.,"Dorothy found her album, switched on another light, and told Katie to make room for her on her chair.","Amory, dawdling like that, and then, when spoken to, to have the face to say that she was hurrying back home!---- It was some minutes later that Lady Tasker said off-handedly, ""Has she any children besides those twins?""","""Amory?""","Dorothy replied, looking up from the album.","""No.""","""How old is she?""",Lady Tasker asked.,"""Thirty-two, isn't she, Katie?""","""About that.""","""Is she very--athletic?""",Lady Tasker next wanted to know.,"""Not at all, I should say.""","""I mean she doesn't go in for marathon races or Channel swimming or anything of that kind?""","""Amory?","No,"" said Dorothy, puzzled.","""And you're sure of her age?""",the old lady persisted.,"""Well--she may only be thirty-one.""","""I don't mean is she younger.","Is she _older_ than that?""","""No--I know by my own age.""","""H'm!""","said Lady Tasker; and again her needle danced....

About that painting of her friend's, Lady Tasker wanted to know: did Mrs. Pratt get any real satisfaction out of it?--Any emotional satisfaction?--Was she entirely wrapped up in it?--Or was it just a sort of hitting at the air?--Did it exhaust her to no purpose, or was it really worth something when it was done?---- ""If Dorothy doesn't know, surely you do, Katie.""","Katie coloured a little.--""I liked 'Barrage' awfully at the time,"" she confessed, ""but--,"" and she cheered up again, ""--I _hate_ it now.""","""But did her work--what's the expression?--fill her life?""","Here Dorothy answered for Katie.--""I think she rather liked the fame part of it,"" she said slowly.","""Does she paint now?""","""Very little, I think, Lady Tasker.""","""Has her children to look after, I suppose?""","""Well--she has both a nurse and a governess----"" ""They're quite well off, aren't they?","I seem to remember that Pratt came into quite a lot.""","""They seem to spend a great deal.""","""But that's only a small house of theirs?""","""Oh, yes, they're rather proud of that.",They don't spend their money selfishly.,"It goes to the Cause, you see.""","""What Cause?""",Lady Tasker asked abruptly.,"This was Katie's cue.... She ceased, and Lady Tasker muttered something.","It sounded rather like ""H'm!","Too much money and not enough to do!""",but neither of her companions was near enough to be quite sure.,And thereupon the questions stopped.,But a surmise of their drift had begun to dawn glimmeringly upon Dorothy.,"She ceased to hear the exposition of Imperialism's real needs into which Katie presently launched, and fell into a meditation.","And of that meditation this was about the length and breadth:-- Until the law should allow a man to have more wives than one (if then), of course only one woman in the world could be perfectly happy--the woman who had Stan.","That conviction came first, and last, and ran throughout her meditation.",And of what Dorothy might compassionately have called secondary happinesses she had hitherto not thought very much.,"She had merely thanked her stars that she had not married a man like Cosimo, had once or twice rather resented Amory's well-meant but left-handed kindnesses, and that had been the extent of her concern about the Pratt household.","But first Katie, and now her aunt, had set her wondering hard enough about that household now.","What, she asked herself, had the Pratts married on?","What discoveries had they made in one another, what resources found within themselves?","Apart from their talks and books and meetings and ""interests"" and that full pack of their theories, what was their marriage?","Thrown alone together for an hour, did they fret?",Did their yawning cease when the bell rang and a caller was admitted?,"Did even the same succession of callers become stale and a bore, so that strangers had to be sought to provide a stimulus?","And did they call these and half a hundred other forms of mutual boredom by the rather resounding names that blabbing Katie had repeated to her--""wider interests,"" ""the broad outlook,"" ""the breaking down of personal insularity,"" and the rest?",And for once Dorothy dropped her excusatory attitude towards her friend.,She dropped it so completely that by and by she found herself wondering whether Amory would have married Cosimo had he been a poor man.,"She was aware that, stated in that way, it sounded hideous; nor did she quite mean that perhaps Amory had married Cosimo simply and solely because he had _not_ been poor; no doubt Amory had assumed other things to be equal that as a matter of fact had unfortunately proved to be not equal at all; but she _did_ doubt now whether Amory had not missed that something, that something made of so many things, that caused her own heart suddenly to gush out to the absent Stan.",The thought frightened her a little.,"Had Amory married and had babies--all, as it were, beside the mark?...",Dorothy did not know.,But an obscurer hint still had seemed to lie behind her aunt's persistent questions.,"""Was Amory ill?""","she herself had asked in alarm when that unexpected word ""doctor"" had been quietly dropped; and ""Ill?","I didn't say she was ill; there's no illness about it,"" Lady Tasker had replied.",No illness about what?,"Apparently about something Lady Tasker saw, or thought she saw, in Amory.... An old lady whose years had earned her the right to sit comfortably in her chair had gone so far as to descend the stairs and go out into the street to have a closer look at a young one: why?","Why ask ""Is she a Channel swimmer?""","and ""Is her painting a mere hitting of the air?""","Why this insistence on some satisfaction for labour, as if without that satisfaction the labour wreaked on the labourer some sort of revenge?",What sort of a revenge?,And why on Amory?,"Yes, Dorothy would have liked to ask her aunt a good many questions....

Much less odd was that homely summing-up of Lady Tasker's: ""Too much money, and not enough to do.""...",Dorothy had often thought that herself.,"V ""HOUSE FULL"" The gate in the privet hedge of The Witan had had little rest all the afternoon.","It was a Sunday, the one following that on which Lady Tasker had issued bareheaded from her door, had crossed the road, and had caused Amory to start half out of her skin by suddenly speaking to her.","The Wyrons had come in the morning; they had been expressly asked to lunch; but it was known that Dickie Lemesurier was coming in afterwards to discuss an advertisement, and if Dickie came the chances were that Mr. Brimby would not be very long after her.","As a matter of fact Dickie and Mr. Brimby had encountered one another outside and had arrived together at a little after three, bringing three young men, friends of Mr. Brimby's still at Oxford, with them.","These young men wore Norfolk jackets, gold-pinned polo-collars, black brogues and turned-up trousers; and apparently they had hesitated to take Cosimo at his word about ""spreading themselves about anywhere,"" for they stood shoulder to shoulder in the studio, and when one turned to look at a picture or other object on the wall, all did so.","Then, not many minutes later, Mr. Wilkinson had entered, in his double-breasted blue reefer, bringing with him a stunted, bowlegged man who did not carry, but looked as if he ought to have carried, a miner's lamp; and by half-past four, of The Witan's habitués, only Mr. Prang and Edgar Strong were lacking.",But Edgar was coming.,"It had been found impossible, or at any rate Amory had decided that it was impossible, to discuss the question of Dickie's advertisement without him.",But he was very late.,"When Britomart Belchamber came in simultaneously with the tea and the twins at a little before five, the studio was full.","The asbestos log purred softly, and Mr. Brimby's three Oxford friends, glad perhaps of something to do, walked here and there, each of them with a plate of bread and butter in either hand, not realizing that at The Witan the beautiful Chinese rule of politeness was always observed--""When the stranger is in your melon-patch, be a little inattentive.""","Had Dickie Lemesurier and Laura Wyron eaten half the white and brown that was presented to them, they must have been seriously unwell.","It was Cosimo, grey-collared and with a claret-coloured velvet waistcoat showing under his slackly-buttoned tweed jacket, who gave the young men the friendly hint, ""Everybody helps themselves here, my dear fellows.""","Then the Norfolk jackets came together again, and presently their owners turned with one accord to examine the hock and the top-side that hung on the wall over the sofa.",Not so much a blending of voices as an incessant racket of emphatic and independent pronouncements filled the studio.,"Walter Wyron had fastened upon the man who looked as if he ought to have carried a miner's lamp, and his forefinger was wagging like a gauge-needle as he explained that one of his Lectures had been misrepresented, and that he had _never_ taken up the position that a kind of Saturnalia should be definitely state-established.","He admitted, nevertheless, that the question of such an establishment ought to be considered, like any other question, on its merits, and that after that the argument should be followed whithersoever it led.--Dickie Lemesurier, excessively animated, and with the whites showing dancingly all round her pupils, was talking Césanne and Van Gogh to Laura, and declaring that something was ""quite the"" something or other.--Mr.",Brimby's hand was fondling Bonniebell's head while he deprecated the high degree of precision of the modern rifle to Mr. Wilkinson.,"""If only it wasn't so ruthlessly logical!""",he was sighing.,"""If only it was subject to the slight organic accident, to those beautiful adaptations of give-and-take that make judgment harsh, and teach us that we ought never to condemn!""","--Corin, drawn by the word ""gun,"" was demanding to be told whether that was the gun that had been taken away from him.--And Britomart Belchamber, indifferent alike to the glances of the Oxford men and their trepidation in her presence, stood like a caryatid under a wall-bracket with an ivy-green replica of Bastianini's Dante upon it.","""No, no, not for a moment, my dear sir!""",Walter shouted to the man who looked like (and was) a miner.,"""That is to ignore the context.",I admit I used the less-known Pompeian friezes as a rough illustration of what I meant--but I did _not_ suggest that Waring & Gillow's should put them on the market!,What I did say was that we moderns must work out our damnation on the same lines that the ancients did.,"Read your Nietzsche, my good fellow, and see what _he_ says about the practical serviceability of Excess!","I contend that a kind of general _oubliance_, say for three weeks in the year, to which everybody without exception would have to conform (so that we shouldn't have the superior person bringing things up against us afterwards)----"" ""Ah doan't see how ye could mak' fowk----,"" the miner began, in an accent that for a moment seemed to blast a hole clean through the racket.",But the hole closed up again.,"""Ah, at present you don't,"" Walter cried.","""The spade-work isn't done yet.",We need more education.,"But every new and great idea----"" But here an outburst from Mr. Wilkinson to Mr. Brimby drowned Walter's voice.","Mr. Wilkinson raised his clenched fist, but only for emphasis, and not in order to strike Mr. Brimby.","""Stuff and nonsense!","There you go, Brimby, trimming again!","We've heard all that: 'A great deal to be said on both sides,'""--(Mr. Wilkinson all but mimicked Mr. Brimby).","""There isn't--not if you're going to do anything!",There's only one side.,You've got to shoot or be shot.,I'm a shooter.,"Give me five hundred real men and plenty of barricade stuff----"" ""Oh, oh, oh, my dear friend!""",Mr. Brimby protested.,"""Why, if your principles were universally applied----"" ""Who said anything about applying 'em universally?",Hang your universal applications!,I'm talking about the Industrial Revolution.,"I'll tell you what's the matter with you, Brimby: you don't like the sight of blood.",I'm not blaming you.,Some men are like that.,But it's in every page of your writing.,You've got a bloodless style.,"I don't mind admitting that I liked some of your earlier work, while there still seemed a chance of your making up your mind some day----"" But here Mr. Wilkinson in his turn was drowned, this time by an incredulous laugh from Cosimo, who had joined Dickie and Laura.","""Van Gogh says _that_?""",his voice mounted high.,"""Really?",You're sure he wasn't joking?,Ha ha ha ha!...,But it's rather pathetic really.,"One would think Amory'd never painted 'Barrage,' nor the 'White Slave,' nor that--,"" he pointed to the unfinished canvas of ""The Triumph of Humane Government"" on the wall.","""By Jove, I must make an Appendix of that!...","Here--Walter!--Have you told him, Dickie?--Walter!----"" But Walter was now at deadly grips with the man who had forgotten his miner's lamp.","""I tell you I never used Saturnalia in that sense at all!----"" But the miner stood his ground.","""Happen ye didn't, but I'll ask ye one question: Have ye ever been to Blackpool of a August Bank Holiday?----"" ""My good man, you talk as if I proposed to do something with the stroke of a pen, to-morrow, before the world's ready for it----"" ""Have ye ever been to Blackpool of a Bank Holiday?""","""What on earth has Blackpool to do with it?----"" ""Well, we'll say Owdham Wakes week at t' Isle o' Man--Douglas----"" ""Pooh!",You've got hold of the wrong idea altogether!,"Do you know what Saturnalia _means_?----"" ""I know there's a man on Douglas Head, at twelve o'clock i' t' day, wi' t' sun shining, going round wi' a stick an' prodding 'em up an' telling 'em to break away----"" ""I shouldn't have thought anybody could have been so _incredibly_ slow to grasp an idea--!""","cried Walter, his hands aloft.","""Have--you--ever--been--to--Blackpool--when--t' Wakes--is on?""","Then Cosimo called again-- ""Walter!",I say!,Come here!...,"Dickie's just told me something that makes the '_Life and Work_' _rather_ necessary, I think!----"" And Walter turned his back on the miner and joined his wife and Dickie and Cosimo.","Anybody who wasn't anybody might have supposed the noise to be a series of wrangles, but of course it wasn't so at all really.",Issues far too weighty hung in the balance.,"It is all very well for people whose mental range is limited by _matinées_ and Brooklands and the newest car to talk in pleasant and unimpassioned voices, but what was going to happen to Art unless Cosimo hurled himself and the '_Life and Work_' against this heretic Van Gogh, and what was to become of England if Walter allowed a pig-headed man who could say nothing but ""Blackpool Pier, Blackpool Pier,"" to shout him down, and what would happen to Civilization if Mr. Wilkinson did not, figuratively speaking, take hold of the dilettante Brimby and shake him as a terrier shakes a rat?",No: there would be time enough for empty politenesses when the battle was won.,"In the meantime, a mere nobody might have thought they were merely excessively rude to one another.",Then began fresh combinations and permutations of the talk.,"Mr. Wilkinson, whose square-cut pilot jacket somehow added to the truculence of his appearance, planted himself firmly for conversation before Dickie Lemesurier; the miner, whose head at a little distance appeared bald, but on a closer view was seen to be covered with football-cropped and plush-like bristles, nudged Cosimo's hip, to attract his attention: and Walter Wyron sprang forward with a welcoming ""Hallo, Raffinger!""",as the door opened and two young McGrath students were added to the crowd.,"For a minute no one voice preponderated in the racket; it was-- ""Hallo, Raff!","Thought you weren't coming!""","""I want a gun!""",(This from Corin.),"""My dear Corin"" (this from Bonniebell), ""Miss Belchamber's told you over and over again guns are anti-social----"" ""Anybody smoking?","Well, I know they don't mind----"" ""But, Miss Lemesurier, where a speaker reaches only a hundred or two, the written word----"" ""Ah, but the personal, magnetic thrill----"" (This was in Dickie's rather deep voice.)","Then Walter, to somebody else, not the miner-- ""I should have thought _anybody_ would have known that when I said Saturnalia I meant----"" ""Where's Amory?""","""Sweet, in those little tunics!----"" ""A subsidy from the State, of course----"" Then the miner, but not to Walter-- ""I' t' daylight, proddin' 'em up wi' a stick--to say nowt o' Port Skillian bathin'-place of a fine Sunda'----"" ""That hoary old lie, that Socialism means sharing----"" ""Oh, at any artists' colourman's----"" ""No; it will probably be published privately----"" ""Van Gogh----"" ""Oh, you're _entirely_ wrong!----"" And then, in the middle of a sudden and mysterious lull, the man who had come without his safety-lamp was heard addressing Cosimo again:-- ""Well, what about t' new paaper?",Owt settled yet?...,"Nay, ye needn't look; Wilkinson telled me; it's all right; nowt 'at's said 'll go beyond these fower walls.","Wilkinson's gotten a rare list together, names an' right, I can tell ye!","But t' way I look at it is this----"" Cosimo looked blank.","""But, my dear--I'm afraid I didn't catch your name----,"" he said.","""Crabtree--Eli Crabtree.","This is t' point I want to mak', mister.","Ye see, I can't put things grammar; but there's lots about 'at can; so I thowt we'd get a sec'etary, an' I'd sit an' smoke whol' my thowts come, and then I'd tell him t' tale.","Ye see, ye want to go slap into t' middle o' t' lives o' t' people.",Now comin' up o' t' tram-top I bethowt me of a champion series: '_Back to Back Houses I've Known_.',"I'll bet a crahn that wi' somb'dy to put it grammar for me----"" ""My dear Crabtree, I'm afraid, don't you know, that there's been some mistake----"" And at this point, everybody becoming conscious at the same moment that they were listening, a fresh wave of sound flowed over the assembly; and presently Mr. Wilkinson was seen to take Cosimo aside and to be making the gestures of a man who is explaining some ridiculous mistake.","Then once more:-- ""I beg your pardon--I thought you were Mrs. Pratt----"" ""Put grammar--straight to fowk's hearts--sinks and slopstones an' all t' lot----"" ""No, Balliol----"" ""But listen, Pratt, the way the mistake arose----"" ""Ellen Key, of course----"" ""The 'Times!'","--As if the 'Times' wasn't _always_ wrong!----"" ""There's a raucousness about her paint----"" ""The Caxton Hall, at eight--do come!----"" ""But we authors are so afraid of sentiment nowadays!----"" ""Bombay, I think--or else Hyderabad----"" ""Oh, he talks like a fool!----"" ""Raff!","Come here and recite '_The King is Duller_'----"" ""But Love _is_ Law!----"" ""Suspend our judgments until we've heard the other side----"" ""Only water--but they couldn't break her spirit--she was out again in three days----"" And again there came an unexpected lull.","This time it was broken by, perhaps not the loudest, but certainly the most travelling voice yet--the voice of the caryatid beneath the bracket with the bust upon it.",Miss Belchamber was dressed in a sleeveless surcoat chess-boarded with large black and white squares; the skirt beneath it was of dark blue linen; and there were beards of leather on her large brown brogues.,"One of the young Oxford men, greatly daring, had approached her and asked her a question.",She turned slowly; she gave the young man the equal-soul-to-equal-soul look; and then the apparatus of perfect voice-production was set in motion.,"Easily and powerfully the air came from her magnificent chest, up the splendid six-inch main of her throat, rang upon the hard anterior portion of her palate, and was cut, as it were, to its proper length and shaped into perfect enunciation by her red tongue and beautiful white teeth.","""What?""",she said.,The undergraduate fell a little back.,"""Only--I only asked if you'd been to many theatres lately.""","""Not any.""","""Oh!...","I--I suppose you know everybody here?""","""Yes.""","""Do point them out to me!""","""That's Walter Wyron.",That's Mrs. Wyron.,That's Miss Lemesurier.,I don't know who the little man is.,That's Mr. Wilkinson.,"My name's Belchamber.""","""Oh--I say--I mean, thanks awfully.","We've heard of them all, of course,"" the unhappy young man faltered.","""What?""","""All distinguished names, I mean.""","""Of course.""","""Rather!----"" And again everybody listened, became conscious of the fact, and broke out anew.",But where all this time was Amory?,"Demonstrably, exactly where she ought to have been--in her bedroom.","She was too dispirited to be accessible to the rational talk of others; she did not feel that she had energy enough to be a source of illumination herself; surely, then, merely because a lot of people, invited and uninvited, chose to come to The Witan, she need not put herself out to go and look after them.","They might call themselves her ""guests"" if they liked; Amory didn't care what form of words they employed; the underlying reality remained--that she was intensely bored, and too fundamentally polite to bore others by going down.",Perhaps she would go down when Edgar came.,She had left word that she was to be informed of his arrival.,But he was very late.,"Nevertheless, she knew that he would come.",Lately she had grown a little more perspicacious about that.,"It had dawned on her that, everything else apart, she had some sort of hold on him through the ""Novum,"" and there had been a trace of command in her summons that he was pretty sure not to disregard.","No doubt he would try to get away again almost directly, but she had arranged about that.",She intended to keep him to supper.,Also the Wyrons.,And Britomart Belchamber too would be there.,And of course Cosimo.,"She moved restlessly between her narrow bed and the window, now polishing her nails, now glancing at her hair in the glass.","From the window she could see over the privet hedge and down the road, but there was no sign of Edgar yet.","She looked at herself again in the glass, without favour, and then sat down on the edge of her bed again.",Her meeting with Lady Tasker the week before had greatly unsettled her.,"Very stupidly, she had quite forgotten that Lady Tasker lived in Cromwell Gardens.","She would have thought nothing at all of the meeting had Lady Tasker had a hat on her head and gloves on her hands; she would have set that down as an ordinary street-encounter; but Dorothy's aunt had evidently seen her from some window, perhaps not for the first time, and, if not for the first, very likely for the third or fourth or fifth.","In a word, Amory felt that she had been caught.","And, as she had been thinking of Edgar Strong at the moment when the old lady's voice had startled her so, it was not beyond the bounds of possibility that her start had seemed remarkable.",Lady Tasker was so very sharp.,"At all events, even Edgar was not going to have everything all his own way.","For she was sure now that she had the hold of the ""Novum"" on him, and that that hold was not altogether the single-minded devotion to his duty he had made it out to be on that day when she had last gone to the office.",Not that she thought too unkindly of him on that account.,"The labourer, even in the field of Imperial Politics, is still worthy of his hire, and poor Edgar, like the rest of the world, had to make the best compromise he could between what he would have liked to do and what circumstances actually permitted him to do.",Of course he would be anxious to keep his job.,"If he didn't keep it a worse man would get it, and India would be no better off, but probably worse.",She sighed that all work should be subject to compromises of this kind.,"Edgar, in a word, was no longer a hero to her, but, by his very weakness, something a little nearer and dearer still.","But for all that she had not hesitated to use her ""pull"" in order to get him to The Witan that day.",She saw him as she advanced to the glass again.,He was nearly a quarter of a mile down the road.,She found a little secret delight in watching his approach when he was unconscious of her watching.,"His figure was still very small, and she indulged herself with a fancy, closing her eyes for a moment in order to do so.","Suppose he had been, not approaching, but going away--then when she opened her eyes again he would look smaller still.... She opened them, and experienced a little thrill at seeing him nearer and plainer.",She could distinguish the red spot of his tie.,Now he turned his head to look at some people who passed.,Now he stepped off the pavement to make room for somebody.,"Now he was on the pavement again--now hidden by a tree--now once more disclosed, and quite near---- She straightened herself, gave a last look into the glass, and descended.",She met him in the hall.,"They shook hands, but did not speak.",There was no need for him to ask whether anybody had come; the babble of noise could be plainly heard through the closed studio door.,"They walked along the passage, descended the two steps into the garden, and reached the studio.","Strong opened the door, and-- ""_Ha, ha, ha!_ I shall tell them that at the Nursery!----"" ""No--just living together----"" ""Corin!--Corin!----"" ""The eighteenth, at the Little Theatre----"" Then the voice of Mr. Crabtree vociferating to his friend Mr. Wilkinson.","""I thowt ye telled me 'at Pratt knew all about it----"" ""One day in the High, just opposite Queens----"" ""Not know the '_Internationale_'!--Debout, les damnés de la terre----!""","Next, sonorously, Miss Belchamber.","""Yes, I dance 'Rufty Tufty' and 'Catching of Quails'----"" ""But my good chap, don't you see that the Referendum----"" ""Oh, throw it down anywhere--on the hearth----"" ""Really, the bosh he talks----"" ""The Minority Report----"" ""Corin!----"" ""Plato----"" ""Prang----"" Then, before anybody had had time to notice the entry of Amory and Edgar Strong, an extraordinary, not to say a regrettable thing occurred.","Mr. Eli Crabtree had spent the last twenty minutes in going deliberately from one person to another, often thrusting himself unceremoniously between two people already engaged in conversation, and in subjecting them to questionings that had become less and less reticent the further he had passed round the room.","And it appeared that this collier who had forgotten his Davy had yet another lamp with him--the lamp of his own narrow intelligence and inalienable, if worthless, experience.","By the help of that darkness within him that he mistook for light, he had added inference to inference and conclusion to conclusion.",Cosimo--Wilkinson--Walter Wyron--Brimby--the Balliol men--the young students of the McGrath--he had missed not one of them; but none knew the portent of his tour of the studio until he had reached the hearth again.,"Then he was seen to be standing with his hands behind him, as if calmly summing them up.","""By--Gow!""","he said half to himself, his football-cropped head moving this way and that and his eyes blinking rapidly as he sought somebody to address.","Then, all in a moment, he ceased his attempt to single out one more than another, and was addressing them in the lump, for all the world as if he had been allowed the entrée of the house, not as a high and memorable privilege and in order that he might learn something he had never suspected before, but as if, finding himself there, _he_ might as well tell _them_ a thing or two while he was about it.","And though his astonishment at what he had seen might well have rendered him dumb, his good temper did not for an instant forsake him.","""By--Gow!""",he said again.,"""But this _is_ a menagerie, an' reight!""","The instantaneous dead silence and turn of every head might have disconcerted a prophet, but they made not the slightest impression on Mr. Crabtree.","""It _is_ a menagerie!""",he continued superbly.,"""Ding, if onnybody'd told me I wadn't ha' believed 'em!--Let's see how monny of ye there is----"" And calmly he began to count them.","""Fowerteen--fifteen--sixteen countin' them two 'at's just come in an' leavin' out t' barns.","Sixteen of ye, grown men an' women, an' not a single one of ye knows ye're born!","Nay, it's cappin'!--Him wi' his Salmagundys or whativver he calls 'em, an' niver been on Douglas Head!--T' maister here, 'at doesn't know what a back-to-back is, I'se warrant!--An' yon chap--,"" Mr. Crabtree's forefinger was straight as a pistol between Mr. Brimby's eyes, ""--'at says there's a deeal to be said o' both sides an'll be having his pocket'ankercher out in a minute!--An' these young men thro' t' Collidge!--Nay, if it doesn't beat all!","I ne'er thowt to live to see t' day!----"" And he made a T-t-t-ing with his tongue on his palate, while his sharp little eyes looked on them all with amusement and pity.",Out of the silence of consternation that had fallen on the studio Walter Wyron was the first to come.,"He nudged Cosimo, as if to warn him not to spoil everything, and then, with his hands deep in the pockets of his knickers and an anticipatory relish on his face, said ""I say, old chap--make us a speech, won't you?""","But if Walter thought to take a rise out of Mr. Crabtree he was quite, quite mistaken.",With good-natured truculence the collier turned on him also.,"""A speech?""",he said.,"""Well, I wasn't at t' back o' t' door when t' speechifyin'-powers was given out; it wadn't be t' first time I'd made a speech, nut by a mugfull.",Mony's t' time they've put Eeali Crabtree o' t' table i' t' 'Arabian Horse' at Aberford an' called on him for a speech.,"I'd sooner mak' a speech nor have a quart o' ale teamed down my collar, an' that's all t' choice there is when t' lads begins to get lively!...",I don't suppose onny o' ye's ever been i' t' 'Arabian Horse'?,"Ye owt to come, of a oppenin'-time of a Sunda' morning.",Ye'd see a bit o' life.,"Happen ye might ha' to get at t' back o' t' door--if they started slinging pints about, that is--but it's all love, and ye've got to do summat wi' it when ye can't sup onny more.",I should like to have him 'at talks about t' Paraphernalia there;

""Perseverance Row, fower doors from t' 'Arabian Horse'----,"" Mr. Crabtree bawled hospitably through the hubbub....

the subject of them was, of course, Mr. Crabtree.","To his general harangue Mr. Crabtree had added, before leaving, more particular words of advice, making a second tour of the studio for the purpose; and he had distinguished Walter above all the rest by inviting him, not merely to the house four doors from the ""Arabian Horse,"" but to spend a warm afternoon with him on Douglas Head also.",But the Wyrons had these raptures pretty much to themselves.,"Perhaps Cosimo was thinking of Mr. Wilkinson, of some new paper of which he had never heard, and of the assumption that he, apparently, was to find the money for it.","Miss Belchamber was rarely rapturous, so that her silence was nothing out of the way.","Edgar Strong could be rapturous when he chose, but he evidently didn't choose now.",And Amory had far too much on her mind.,"Her original idea in asking the Wyrons to stay to supper had been that they, as acknowledged experts in the subject that perplexed her, would be the proper people to keep the ring while the four persons immediately concerned talked the whole situation quietly and reasonably and thoroughly out.",But she was rather inclined now to think again before submitting her case to them.,"It would be so much better, if the case must be submitted to anybody, that Cosimo should do it.",Then she herself would be able to shape her course in the light of anything that might turn up.,"Nothing, she had to admit, had turned up yet, and Amory was not sure that in that very fact there did not lie a sufficient cause for resentment.",Had Cosimo pleaded a passion for Britomart Belchamber he would have had Passion's excuse.,"Lacking Passion, it could only be concluded that he was bored with Amory herself.",And that amounted to an insult....,"The booming of the gong, however, cut short her brooding.",They passed to the dining-room.,Britomart and Walter sat with their backs to the tall black dresser with the willow pattern stretching up almost to the ceiling; Laura and Edgar took the German chairs that had their backs to the copper-hooded fireplace; and Cosimo and Amory occupied either end of the highly-polished clothless table.,"This absence of cloth, by the way, gave a church-like appearance to the flames of the candles in the spidery brass sticks that had each of them a ring at the top to lift it up by; the preponderance of black oak and dull black frames on the walls further added to the effect of gloom; and the putting down of the little green pipkins of soup and the moving of the green-handled knives and round-bowled spoons made little knockings from time to time.","Again Walter and Laura, with not too much help from Cosimo, sustained the weight of the conversation; and it was not until Amory asked a question in a tone from which rapture was markedly absent that they sponged, as it were, the priceless memory of Mr. Crabtree from their minds.","Amory's question had been about Walter's new Lecture, still in course of preparation, on ""_Post-Dated Passion_""; and Walter cursorily ran over its heads for the general benefit.","""I admit I got the idea from Balzac,"" he said between mouthfuls (whenever they came to The Witan the Wyrons supped almost as heartily as did Edgar Strong himself).","""'Comment l'amour revient aux vieillards,' you know.",But of course that hasn't any earthly interest for anybody.,'Aux vieilles' it ought to be.,"Then--well, then you've simply got 'em.""","""Why not 'vieillards?'""","Amory asked, not very genially.","""I say, Cosimo, I'll have another cutlet if I may.--Why not 'vieillards?'",Quite obvious.,Men aren't the interest.,"I've tried men, and you can ask Laura how the bookings went.--But 'vieilles' and I've got 'em.","Really, Amory, you're getting quite dull if you don't see that!",I'll explain.,"You see, I've already got the younger ones, like Brit here--shove the claret along, Brit--but the others, of forty or fifty say, well, they've all had their affairs--or if they haven't better still--and it's merely a question of touching the right chord.","Regrets, time they've lost, fatal words 'Too late' and so on--it's simply _made_ for me!",Touch the chord and they do the rest for themselves.,"They probably won't hear half of it for sobbing.--Of course I shall probably have to modify my style a bit--not quite so--what shall I say----"" ""Jaunty,"" his wife suggested, ""--in the best sense, I mean----"" ""Hm--that's not quite the word--but never mind.",It's a great field.,"Certainly women, not men, are the draw.""","Amory made a rather petulant objection, and the argument lasted some minutes.","In the end Walter triumphantly gained his first point, that women and not men were the ""draw"" in the box-office sense, and also his second one, namely, that not the Britomarts, but the older women, who would put their hearts into his hands and pay him for exploiting their helplessness and ache and tenderness and regret, and never suspect that they were being practised upon, were ""simply made for him...."" ""What do you think of my title?""",he asked.,And the title was discussed.,Amory was beginning to find Walter just a little grasping.,She wished that after all she had not asked the Wyrons to stay to supper.,"Formerly she had thought that marriage-escapade of theirs big and heroic (that too, by the way, had been in the Latin Quarter, and probably on seven francs a day); but now she was less sure about that.","Quite apart from the inapplicability of the Wyrons' experience to her own case, she now wondered whether theirs had in fact been experience at all.","Now that she came to think of it, they had taken no risks.","They _had_ been married, and in the last event could always turn round on their critics and silence them with that fact....",Nor was she quite so ready now to lay even the souls of Britomart and Cosimo on the dissecting-table for the sake of seeing Walter exercise his professional skill upon them.,This was not so much that she wanted to spare Cosimo and Britomart as that she did not want to give Walter a gratification.,"She was inclined to think that if Walter couldn't be a little more careful about contradicting her he might find his advertisement omitted from the ""Novum"" one week, as Katie Deedes' had been omitted, and where would he be then?","The way in which he had just said that she was ""getting quite dull"" had been next door to a rudeness....",But she had to admit that she felt dull.,"Edgar, who sat next to her, did not speak, and Cosimo, who faced her, was apparently still brooding on people who planned the spending of his money without thinking it necessary to consult him first.",She was tired of the whole of the circumstances of her life.,Paris on seven francs a day could hardly be much worse.,"Nor, if she could but shake off her lethargy, need that sum be fixed as low as seven francs.",For she had lately remembered an arrangement made between herself and Cosimo before she had ever consented to become engaged to him.,"It was a long time since either of them had spoken of this arrangement--so long that Cosimo would have been almost within his rights had he maintained that the circumstances had so altered as to make it no longer binding; but there it was, or had been, and it had never been expressly revoked.","It was the arrangement by which they had set apart a fund to insure themselves, either or both of them, against any evils that might arise from incompatibility.",Amory had no idea how the matter now stood.,"She didn't suppose for a moment that Cosimo had actually set a sum by each week or month; but, hard and fast or loose and fluid, he must have made, or be still ready to make, some provision.","It was an inherent part of the contract that a solemn affirmation, with reason shown (spiritual, not mere legal reason) by either one or the other, should constitute a sufficient claim on this fund.",Therefore Paris need not necessarily be the worst penury.,"But, for all her new inclination to leave the Wyrons out of it, she still thought it a prudent idea to carry the fight (not that there would be any fight--that was only a low way of expressing the high reasonableness that always prevailed at The Witan) to Cosimo and Britomart, rather than to have it centre about Edgar and herself.",Walter's eyes were mainly on the box-office nowadays.,The original virtue of that fine protest of theirs was--there was no use in denying it--gone.,He spread his Lectures frankly now as a net.,"Well, that was only one net more among the many nets of which she was becoming conscious.","Edgar too, poor boy, was compelled to regard even the ""Novum"" as in some manner a net.","Mr. Brimby, Amory more than guessed, had nets to spread.","Mr. Wilkinson, in his own way, was out for a catch; and Dickie fished at the Suffrage Shop; and Katie had fished at the Eden; and the only one who didn't fish was Mr. Prang, who wrote his articles about India for nothing, just to be practising his English.",And all these nets were spread for somebody's money--a good deal of it Cosimo's.,"It had been the same, though perhaps not quite so bad, at Ludlow.",That experiment on the country-side had been alarmingly costly.,And all this did not include the dozens and dozens of nets of narrower mesh.,"The ""Novum"" might gulp down money by the hundred, but the lesser things were hardly less formidable in the sum of them--subscriptions, contributions, gifts, loans, investments, shares in the Eden and the Book Shop, mortgages, second mortgages, subsidies, sums to ""tide over,"" backings, guarantees, losses cut, more good money sent to bring back the bad, fresh means of spending devised by somebody or other almost every day.",It had begun to weary even Amory.,The people who came to The Witan became rather curiously better-dressed the longer their visiting continued; but the things they professed to hold dear appeared very little further advanced.,All that first brightness and promise had gone.,Amory's interest had gone.,"She wanted to escape from it all, and to go away with Edgar appeared once more to be the readiest way out.","But, though she might now wish to keep Walter Wyron out of it all, that did not necessarily mean that Walter would be kept out.","This _ex-officio_ specialist on the (preferably female) heart, this professional rectifier of unfortunate marriages, had not done a number of years' platform-work without having discovered the peculiar beauties of the _argumentum ad hominem_, and it was one of his practices to enforce his arguments with ""Take the case of Brit here""--or ""Let's get down to the concrete: suppose Amory--"" And these descents to the particular had always a curiously accusatory effect.","Walter, interrupting Amory's meditation, broke into one of them now.","""But my dear chap,""--this was to Cosimo,""--I can't imagine what's come over all of you to-night!","First Amory, now you!",You're usually quicker than this!,"Let's take a case.--Brit here----"" One sterno-mastoid majestically turned the caryatid's head.",Again Miss Belchamber's grand thorax worked as if somebody had put a penny into the slot.,"""What?""",she said.,"""Quiet, Brit;

All this fuss about a single Governor, of whom Mr. Prang himself had said (and there was no gentler soul living than Mr. Prang) that his extortions had been a byword and his obstinacy proof positive of his innate weakness!---- But Amory was not in the pond-room that day, and so Dorothy's sickly display of emotion went unchecked.","The nurse herded the Bits together, but they were not admitted for their usual tea-time romp.","Indeed, Dorothy said presently, ""Do you mind if I leave you for a few minutes with Katie, auntie?""",She went into her bedroom and did not return.,"Of all his ""nieces"" she had been his favourite; her foot caught in one of his Kabuli mats as she entered the bedroom.",She lay down on her bed.,She longed for Stan to come and put his arms about her.,He came in before Lady Tasker had finished her prolonged questioning of Katie.,Aunt Grace told him where Dorothy was.,Then she and Katie left together.,The newspapers showed an excellent sense of proportion about the incident.,In the earlier evening editions the death of Sir Benjamin was nicely balanced by the 4.30 winners; and then a popular actor's amusing replies in the witness-box naturally overshadowed everything else.,"And, to anticipate a little, on the following day the ""Times"" showed itself to be, as usual, hopelessly in the wrong.",Indeed there were those who considered that this journal made a deplorable exhibition of itself.,"For it had no more modesty nor restraint than to use the harsh word ""murder,"" without any ""alleged"" about it, which was, of course, a flagrant pre-judging of the case.","Nobody denied that at a first glance appearances _were_ a little against the gentle and dusky brother, who had been seized with the revolver still in his hand; but that was no reason why a bloated capitalist rag should thus undermine the principles of elementary justice.",It ought to have made it all the more circumspect....,But anybody who was anybody knew exactly what was at the bottom of it all.,"The ""Times"" was seeking a weapon against the Government.","The staff was no doubt secretly glad that it had happened, and was gloating, and already calculating its effect on an impending by-election....","Besides, there was the whole ethical question of capital punishment.","It would not bring Sir Benjamin back to life to try this man, find him guilty, and do him barbarously to death in the name of the Law.",That would only be two dead instead of one.,"The proper way would be to hold an inquiry, with the dusky instrument of justice (whose faith in his mission must have been very great since he had taken such risks for it) not presiding, perhaps, but certainly called as an important witness to testify to the Wrongness of the Conditions....","Besides, an assassination is a sort of half-negligible outbreak, regrettable certainly, for which excuse can sometimes be found: but this other would be deliberate, calculated, measured, and in flat violation of the most cardinal of all the principles on which a great Empire should be based--the principle of Mercy stiffened with exactly the right modicum of Justice....
