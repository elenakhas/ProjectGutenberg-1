"While he was telling me all his plans and schemes of defence, I heard in the distance, through the open window, the usual sounds of twilight; the wheels creaking in the ruts, the rumbling of the train, the rustling of the leaves in the thickets; and at moments another sound, as of all these blended together and increasing in volume, seemed to rise from the ground, following the course of the river and little hills on the horizon, to grow gradually louder and louder.","It was like the tramp of an army on the march, hurrying on in the fading light to find their halting-place, while the first rays of moonlight fall on the barrels of the guns and the gilded spikes of the helmets .",.,.,Suddenly a dull report on a level with the earth made us start.,"Mother Guillard, who was clearing away my modest repast, felt the pile of plates she was carrying shake in her hands.",—They have blown up the bridge at Corbeil!,.,.,.,said the keeper.,"The pretty country village, where I had so often breakfasted before a day’s shooting, seemed to be sixty miles farther away .",.,.,For a moment we all three looked blankly at each other.,"At last old Guillard rose from his seat, took up his gun and his lantern, muttering between his teeth: —I am going to close the Pacôme gate, he said, with an heroic gesture.",Close the Pacôme gate!,It seemed easy to say; and yet I fancy the good fellow will find some difficulty in doing it.,"For the last century the old door of the cloister has been ajar; the forest has taken advantage of the aperture to slip through, and the indiscreet brambles have climbed in by all the cracks of its disjointed planks.","If we have to undergo a siege, I do not rely much on that gate.",[Picture: The Corbeil bridge]                                 * * * * *

not much frequented by Parisians.","One day, while crossing the forest of Sénart, I discovered the Hermitage, and for the last ten years I have spent all my summers there.","It was a monastery of “Cordeliers,” burnt down in ‘93.","The four principal walls remain standing, but mouldering and crumbling at intervals, making on the turf, heaps of red stone quickly re-clothed by a rich and luxuriant vegetation: poppies, barley, stiff-growing plants with regular and pointed leaves, are divided by the stones like inlaid metal-work.","One gateway looks on the road; the other, that famous Pacôme gate, opens on to the wooded thickets and the little hidden paths, full of balsam and wild mint, where, on a misty morning, I have often fancied I saw disappear, the hood of some old monk gathering wild herbs.","Here and there along the wall, low postern gates, disused for many a century, send through the darkness of the forest long rays of light, as if the cloister contained all the sunlight of the woods.","[Picture: Gateway to the Hermitage] Inside is waste land, with burnt-up grass, little gardens belonging to the peasants, some orchards divided by trellis-work, and two or three houses built of that red stone that is found in the quarries of the wood.","[Picture: Robert’s workroom in the Hermitage] The forester lives in one of these houses, the other is never let.","Mine, a kind of irregular and curious turret, is chiefly remarkable for the Virginian creeper that completely covers it.",I have cut away just enough of it to be able to open my windows.,"Leaving untouched the great worm-eaten beams in the kitchen and the worn step on the threshold, I contented myself with heightening a hayloft under the roof, replacing the walls by glass, and thus making a beautiful studio, where my only neighbours are the nests of the wood-pigeon and magpie swaying to and fro on the top of the trees.","When I am there, the forest surrounds me like an ocean, with the swell of the foliage, the ebb and flow of the breezes, the murmuring softness of a calm.","On a summer’s afternoon, at the hour of silent and slumbering heat, a bumble-bee comes by regularly, dashes against my half-open window-pane, whose brightness attracts him, then like a rebounding ball goes off, shaking the golden dust from his big wings, and disappears amongst the honey-scented bushes of privet.",This bee is my clock.,"When he passes by I say: “Ah, it is two o’clock.”  And I am right .",.,.,"It is, in fact, a wonderful nook for work, and where my best pictures have been painted.","And how I love it, this old Hermitage!",For the last ten years I have been adorning it to the best of my ability.,"I have brought there what I call my treasures—my books, my sketches, my etchings, and some old armour .",.,.,"And now I should have to leave all this, abandon my home, to these robbers.",And what for?,To go and shut myself up in Paris .,.,.,"But as I cannot walk, of what use should I be to them there?",They have too many useless mouths to feed already .,.,.,"Well, no!",Decidedly the fellow is right.,"We must not go away from here, .",.,.,_Pro aris et

hunting-knife, and he had an air of importance befitting the solemnity of his appearance.","—There is bad news, he said, taking up a position by the side of my bed .",.,.,All the wood-rangers are recalled to Paris in order to be enrolled with the customs officers.,We are starting almost immediately.,Honest old Guillard!,"He appeared somewhat agitated while talking to me, and I was myself rather disturbed by the sudden announcement of this departure.","I hurriedly dressed, and we went downstairs.","On the road below was the head-keeper, with about twenty foresters and keepers—the whole of the staff on duty in the forest.","Then came the women, children, and pointers, and two large carts laden with furniture, rabbit-hutches, and chickens tied up by the legs.","The door of the house was wide open, and Mother Guillard moved to and fro inside, seeking what she must leave or take, as the conveyances were full, and the first-comers had taken up all the available space.","The perplexity of the poor housewife was a sight to see, as she ran from one piece of furniture to another, dragging a heavy cupboard to the door, then leaving it there, forgetting the most useful things, but lading herself with those of no value, except that they were souvenirs: the old clock with its glass shade, some marvellous portraits, a hunting-horn, a distaff, all of them covered with dust—that excellent dust that clings to family relics, and of which each particle speaks of youth and the happy days gone by.","—I trust you are not going to remain here, Mr. Robert, the good woman called out as she crossed the orchard .",.,.,You shall be put on a cart.,"And in order to convince me more thoroughly: —In the first place, if you remain here, who will cook for you?",In reality the good creatures were rather ashamed of leaving me behind.,"Their departure, although involuntary, seemed to them somewhat of a betrayal on their part.","I tried to reassure them on my account, and to reassure myself at the same time.","After all, who knows?",The Prussians may not come so far.,"Moreover, the Hermitage is in the heart of the forest, and out of the line of march.",There was therefore not the slightest danger to be apprehended.,"At most a few days of solitude, and that did not alarm me.","Seeing me so thoroughly determined, the keeper pressed my hand.","—Good luck, Mr. Robert .",.,.,My wife will leave you our keys.,You will find wine and potatoes in the cellar.,Take what you choose.,We will settle on our return home .,.,.,"And now, good mother, let us start; and above all, you know what I said to you; try not to cry.","She, however, nearly broke down.","On turning the key for the last time in the lock, her hand shook.",She compressed her lips .,.,.,At that moment a formidable _hee-haw_!,echoed through the Hermitage.,The keeper and his wife looked at each other in consternation.,—It is Colaquet!,.,.,.,What is to become of him?,"[Picture: Colaquet, the donkey] The unfortunate Colaquet, whom they had forgotten in the hurry of departure, was their donkey, a pretty little grey donkey, with a bright and artless look.","A few days before, it had been bitten on the muzzle by a viper, and it had been turned out to graze in a little field of after-grass; and there he was, looking at his masters going away, leaning his swollen head, which gave him the appearance of one of the beasts of the Apocalypse, over the hedge.",How could they take him?,"He would die on the road, and yet the veterinary surgeon had promised to cure him.","The fate of the poor animal, rather resembling my own, touched my heart.",[Picture: .,.,the keeper pressed my hand.],"I promised to take care of Colaquet, and to put him into the stable every night.","The good people thanked me, and we parted.",[Picture: Mother Guillard leaving her home] A sad parting!,"The carts, heavy and overloaded, slowly followed the wide forest road, grinding on the pebbles as they went along.","The children were running on each side, excited by the unexpected journey.","The men, in single file, skirted the edge of the wood, their guns on their shoulders, all of them old soldiers, well trained and disciplined.","Behind them the dogs followed, hanging their heads uneasily, hardly straying even to listen to the flight of a hen-pheasant, or to sniff the trace of a rabbit.","Domestic animals do not like changing their quarters, and these were following in the track of the carts, now become their wandering homes.","Mother Guillard came last, holding in her hand her magpie’s large cage, and from time to time looking back.","Seated on the curbstone near the principal entrance, I watched them till the whole party disappeared from my sight in the narrowing perspective of the road.","I saw the last glance on the gun-barrels, I heard the grinding of the last wheel, and the dust of the highway swallowed them up in a cloud .",.,.,It was all over.,I was alone.,This thought has given me an unaccountable sensation of uneasiness.,"[Picture: Looking along the empty road]                                 * * * * *              [Picture: Robert alone in the Hermitage garden]

expectation, suspending all thought, and rendering all artistic work an impossibility.","I can only undertake those trivial occupations, those necessary details of everyday life, of which I have always had such a horror, and to which I must resign myself now that I am my own servant.",Shall I confess it?,"These trifles do not really weary me very much, and I understand recluses amusing themselves by carving roots or weaving baskets.",Manual labour is a good means of regulating life for those who have too much leisure and liberty.,"Therefore every morning I begin by paying a visit to the poultry-yard, and when I feel the warmth of an egg in the straw, I am happy.","Then, walking slowly, and leaning on a stick, I go round the garden, picking the ripe fruit; and from the long, dry, sunburnt stalks I gather the beans, whose pods burst open and shed their contents through my fingers.","It is laughable to see me seated in front of my door, cutting up the bread for my soup, or washing my salad in a bucket.",All these things give me rather a childish comfort; but is not convalescence itself like childhood?—a fresh beginning of life.,"In order to avoid going up and down the broken and irregular steps of the staircase, I have placed my bed in the large room on the ground floor, which therefore answers the purpose of drawing-room, bed-room, and kitchen.","In this very mild weather, the door leading into the garden remains wide open all day.","I hear the noise of the hens, always busy and cackling, their little claws pattering on the sand and scratching up the straw.","Next door, in the keeper’s small field, I see poor Colaquet stretched out, shaking off the flies, and, with the idleness of an invalid, lolling out his tongue in front of him on the meadow, all purple with the thousand clusters of lucern.","When evening comes on, with some difficulty he approaches the fence that divides us.",I also drag myself there.,"I bathe his wound, renew the water, throw a rug over his back for the night, and he thanks me by shaking his long ears.","What really distresses me in my present state of suffering is having to fetch water from the old convent well, just at the end of the enclosure.","When I reach it, I am obliged to sit down for a moment on the edge of the cracked stonework, overgrown by rank weeds.","The ornamental wrought ironwork, of an elegant and ancient style, appears, under the rust that tarnishes it, like climbing tendrils laid bare by the autumn.","This melancholy is in complete harmony with the deep silence of the Hermitage, and the atmosphere of loneliness that surrounds me .",.,.,The bucket is heavy.,On returning I stop two or three times.,"Over there, at the far end, there is an old door that the wind keeps slamming.","The noise of my footsteps echoes, and troubles me .",.,.,"Oh, solitude!",.,.,.,[Picture: Robert plodding back with the bucket]                                 * * * * *

breakfast too!—fresh eggs, and grapes gathered from my beautiful purple vine.","I was sitting there, idly dreaming, basking in the light, warmth, and silence, very busy looking at the smoke of my pipe and at my painted plates, on which a stray wasp was furiously attacking the emptied stalks.","Around me on that clear autumn day, under a deep and pure blue sky, even more beautiful than the summer skies so often veiled and dimmed by hot mists, I felt the same hush of Nature, the same all-pervading sense of peace .",.,.,"When suddenly a formidable explosion in my immediate vicinity shook the house, rattled the windows, and stirred the leaves, sending forth on all sides the sound of wild flutterings, screams, alarms, and galloping .",.,.,"This time it was not the bridge at Corbeil that was blown up, but our own, our little bridge at Champrosay.","It meant: “The Prussians are here!”  Immediately my heart stood still, and a veil seemed to pass over the sunlight.","Then the thought crossed my mind that to-morrow, this evening maybe, the forest roads would be invaded, darkened by these wretches; that I should be compelled to bury myself alive, and never stir out again.","And I longed to see once more my beloved forest, of which I had been deprived for the last two months.","The lanes in the woods were lovely, widened by freedom from the long summer weeds, and showing at the top, through the young branches, a long ray of light.","At the cross-roads, bathed in sunlight, the faded pink heather was flowering in tufts; and in the thickets, among the black stems, like a small forest beneath a large one, the ferns displayed their microscopic trees with their peculiar foliage.",What a silence!,"Generally a thousand vague sounds greeted me from afar: the trains passing by and marking the distant horizon, the digging of the quarrymen, the cart-wheels slowly turning in the ruts, the strident call-whistle of the gang.","And to-day, not a sound—not even that perpetual murmur which seems like the breathing of a slumbering forest—that stir of the leaves, that humming of the insects, that pretty “_frrrt_!” like the unfolding of a fan, made by birds among the foliage.",It seemed as if the loud report just now had stupefied all Nature.,"Slightly weary, I had seated myself under a thick oak-tree, when I heard a rustling in the branches.",At last!,.,.,.,"I expected to see a hare or a roedeer scamper across the path; but through the parted bushes, about ten paces from me on the road, jumped a big fellow, dressed all in black, with his gun on his shoulder, a revolver in his belt, and his head covered by a large Tyrolese hat.",I was startled.,I thought it was some Bavarian or Saxon rifleman.,"It was, however, a Parisian _franc-tireur_.","At that time there were some twenty of them in the forest, retreating day by day before the Prussians, lying in ambush to watch their line of march, and to knock over from time to time an Uhlan of the advance-guard.","While the man was talking to me, his comrades, coming out of the coppice, joined us.","They were nearly all old soldiers, working-men from the faubourgs of Paris.","I took them back to the Hermitage, and made them drink a few bottles of wine.","[Picture: The blown bridge of Champrosay] They told me the Prince of Saxony’s division had reached Montereau, one stage distant from here.","I learnt also from them about the defensive operations begun round Paris—the organisation of the troops; and to hear them speak with such calm, such confidence, and especially hearing their Parisian accent, warmed my heart.","Ah, brave fellows!","if I could only have gone off with them, stuck on my head their ridiculous headgear, and fought in their ranks, under the walls of the good city!",.,.,.,"But, alas!","to have walked merely twenty steps in the woods had swollen my leg, and I was in pain.","Ah, well!",I was grieved when they left me.,They are probably the last Frenchmen that I shall see for some time

morning, on opening the chest where Mother Guillard placed my week’s provisions—six large floury and golden loaves, that she baked for me every Sunday.",What shall I do?,"I have, it is true, an oven and a kneading-trough, but not an atom of flour.","Perhaps I should find some at the farm at Champrosay, if Goudeloup has remained there as he intended.",But how can I get so far in my present weak condition?,"Seated on my garden bench in front of my door, I was absorbed in these melancholy thoughts, when I heard the sound of an animal galloping in the keeper’s field.",It was Colaquet.,"Colaquet, generally so lazy, was gambolling round the orchard, kicking up little tufts of grass with his hoofs and rolling over on his back, with a feeling of satisfaction and pleasure in living.","In two bounds he came at my call, and leant his head, no longer swollen, but now of normal size, on the wooden trellis; the rapid motion of his long ears, whose language I am beginning to understand, telling me of his happiness at being free and delivered from his pain and infirmity.",Lucky Colaquet!,"he is cured before I am; and while I looked at him with an envious eye, I remembered that there—over there, under the shed—was an old conveyance that Guillard formerly used on fête-days to drive parties of Parisians through the forest.","If I harnessed Colaquet, we might go and fetch some flour .",.,.,So I set to work rummaging under the shed.,"Amongst the rusty pickaxes, hay-rakes, and dilapidated harrows I finally discovered a worm-eaten spring-cart, forgotten and unused, its two shafts lying on the ground.",By means of some pieces of rope and a few nails I put it into a tolerable state of repair.,It occupied me till the evening; but what an interesting piece of work!,"I was amused in turning over those old nails, those worn-out pegs.",Once or twice I surprised myself by whistling over my work.,"Pretty cool, considering I was expecting the Prussians .",.,.,"Now everything is ready, the cart and the team.","To-morrow morning, if in the meanwhile nothing happens, we shall start for Champrosay!",[Picture: The old spring-cart]                                 * *

I shall never be able to live through them.","My hand shakes, my brain is on fire.","However, I must make the attempt .",.,.,At first starting all went well.,The weather was beautiful.,"I had placed a bundle of hay in the cart, and although Colaquet’s eyelids were still swollen from the bite, he managed to take us tolerably straight—he had so often made this journey, carrying bundles of linen to the riverside.","In spite of the slight jolting, I found the drive delightful.",Not the point of a helmet nor the glitter of a gun-barrel to be seen.,"Only, on arriving at Champrosay, the deep silence that had so impressed me in the woods appeared still more striking.","The peasants’ cottages hardly seemed to me the same: no pigeons on the roofs, the doors closed, and the courtyards deserted.","The silent belfry of the little church, with its defaced dial, stood above like a faithful guardian.","Farther on, all the villas along the road, their grounds extending to the forest, were also carefully shut up.","Their summer wealth of flowers continued to bloom, and, under the shade of the clipped trees, the yellow sandy paths were but lightly strewn with a few dead leaves.","Nothing could give a more vivid idea of sudden departure and flight than the sight of these deserted houses, decked out as usual behind their high iron gates.","There seemed still a kind of quiver and warmth of life; and at times, at the turn of the path, visions rose up in my mind of straw hats, upraised parasols, and of goats tethered on the grass-plots in their accustomed place.","[Picture: Colaquet managed to take us tolerably straight] What, however, really seemed deathlike was the road, the highroad to Corbeil, that I had left so full of life, with a continual flow of vans, mail-coaches, market-gardeners’ carts, perambulating poultry-yards full of cackle and prattle; carriages borne along through the whirlwind of their own speed, on which float, even in the calmest weather, the veils and ribbons of the occupants; and the tall waggons laden with fresh hay and scythes and pitchforks, casting long shadows across the road.",And now nothing and no one.,"In the filled-up ruts the dust has the still look of fallen snow, and the two wheels of my spring-cart glide on noiselessly.","At the end of the village the farm appears in the distance, closed, and silent from the foot of its walls to the highest tile of its tall dark roof.",Has Goudeloup also taken flight?,.,.,.,Here I am before the gateway.,I knock—I call.,"A window above the dairy opens cautiously, and I see the cunning, somewhat unkempt head of the farmer appear, with his untrimmed beard, and his small round, suspicious eyes hidden under bushy eyebrows.",—Ah!,"it is you, Mr. Robert .",.,.,Wait a moment.,I am coming down.,"[Picture: Goudeloup appears at a window] Together we enter the little, low room where the carters, harvesters, and threshers usually come in the evening to receive their day’s pay.",In a corner I perceive two loaded guns.,"—You see, says Goudeloup, I am ready for them .",.,.,"If they leave me alone, I shall not stir .",.,.,But if they are imprudent enough to meddle with the farm .,.,.,Let them beware!,"[Picture: The shattered Champrosay bridge] We were talking in low tones, as if in an enemy’s country.","He let me have a few loaves and a sack of flour; then having loaded my cart, we parted, promising each other soon to meet again, .",.,.,Poor man!,"Before returning home, no traces of Prussians being visible, I was tempted to go down the lane which passes under the walls of the farm and leads to the Seine.",It was the whim of an artist.,A river is the soul of a landscape.,"Animating the scene with its ceaseless movement, it gives life to all the changes of the day, and imparts grandeur to Nature by the reflection of its mirrored banks, and of glowing sunsets sinking into tranquil depths of liquid fire.",Now its water faithfully reflects the surrounding melancholy.,"The shattered bridge, the crumbling piers piled up on either side in white heaps of stone, the iron chains dangling in the river, all this seems like a great rent in the landscape, the cruel work of the invader.","No boats, no rafts—the river has returned to its wild, natural state, its surface furrowed by unfettered currents and swirling pools eddying round the ruins of the broken bridge, and bearing on its way nothing but drifting tufts of grass and roots, on which the water-wagtail, wearied out with its long flight, abandons itself to the course of the stream.","On the slopes of each bank the corn and vines still stand, and the newly-mown fields are yet overshadowed by the high haycocks; a whole harvest lost and left to its fate .",.,.,"I had stood there for a moment looking at this scene of disaster, when I heard two shots, followed by shrieks and groans, which seemed to come from the direction of the farm.","I hastened to see what was the matter, and as I approached the cries of “Help—Help” were redoubled.","I recognised the voice of the farmer amongst others raised in anger, a hideous jargon of sound.","I whip up Colaquet, but the hill is steep and Colaquet moves not.",One would almost say he was afraid.,"He lays back his ears and runs up against the wall; besides this, the road takes a turn, and I cannot see what is taking place on the highroad above.","Suddenly, through a breach in the wall that the fall of the neighbouring bridge has made, as if expressly for me, the whole interior of the farm comes into view: the yard, the sheds, men, horses, helmets, long lances, flour sacks burst open, an unhorsed cavalry soldier lying before the well at full length in a pool of blood, and the unfortunate Goudeloup, pale, scared, a hideous object, howling and struggling between two gigantic Uhlans, who have tied a rope round his neck, and are about to swing him up by the pulley outside his hayloft.",It is impossible to describe my sensations.,"I am filled with feelings of indignation, pity, horror, and anger .",.,.,I forget that I am wounded and unarmed.,I prepare to spring over the breach and throw myself on these wretches

great pain, and it really required some courage to step out of the cart, unharness the donkey, and go into the house.",I thought I had for the second time broken my leg.,"However, after an hour’s rest, I was able to rise, take a little food, and write these few pages.","The pain is already less sharp, and nothing remains but a great weariness .",.,.,"Nevertheless, I do not think I shall sleep

rumbling, a noise as of the heavy and monotonous sound of waves, which, enveloping the whole forest, slowly flows on towards Paris, to die away at the point where the wide roads are lost in the immense encompassing zone.","Till now the inundating masses have spared me, and here I remain cowering in the Hermitage, listening to the advancing tide, like a shipwrecked man on a rock surrounded by the sea.","[Picture: Cavalry patrols close by] Luckily for me, if the country is invaded, it is not yet regularly occupied by the troops.",They pass through and do not make any stay.,"Nevertheless, two or three times I have heard at night the cavalry patrols skirt the walls of the Hermitage.","Often, when the shooting season was near, the forest rangers would thus pass by, pausing for an instant under the gateway to call out a loud “Good-night” to the keeper’s little home.","The dogs would bark and sniff at the kennel railings, then a door opened, and old Guillard brought out a large jug of sparkling wine, in which a ray of moonlight danced, and without dismounting they drank it down.","How different from these ghostly patrols, whose very approach makes my heart beat!",They pass by in silence.,"Only from time to time the clink of a sword, the neigh of a horse, a few low-spoken words in a harsh and barbarous language, jar on the stillness of the air.",This effectually drives away sleep for the rest of the night.,"[Picture: “Old Guillard brought out a large jug of sparkling wine.”] In the daytime the clear, shrill notes of the bugles come in gusts to the little garden, with the beating of dull and discordant drums, marking the tune in a jerky, singular rhythm, which seems to accompany a cannibal’s war-dance.","It is to the sound of these barbarous drums that all the northern races, the Goths, Visigoths, Ostrogoths, are advancing over our magnificent roads of the _Ile-de-France_, the glorious autumn weather dazzling them by the unaccustomed brilliancy of its sun and

always mingling in my thoughts.","I think the Prussians must have their hands full over there, for my marauders have not reappeared.","I no longer even hear the long, slow rumbling of the ammunition waggons, nor the rolling of drums, which used to resound on the roads outside the forest.","So I have again lighted the fire in the large room, and I walk openly about in the orchard.",From day to day the difficulties of life increase.,"I have nothing left, neither bread, wine, nor lamp-oil.","A month ago, with the sunshine, the house well aired, and the comfort of warmth, these privations were bearable, but now they seem very hard.",In the poultry-yard there are only two hens left; always hiding under the rafters to escape the continual driving rain.,"I make faggots with the branches of the fruit-trees, which, brittle and no longer protected by their leaves, snap off and fall to the ground.","The apple-trees have golden moss, the plum-trees long streaks of light-coloured gum under their resinous bark, and they make large, bright fires, throwing a sunshine into their warmth.","I have also gathered the last apples, all reddened by the breath of the first frost, and I have made a poor kind of cider, which I drink instead of wine.",With my bread I have been less successful.,"I tried, with the unfortunate Goudeloup’s flour, to knead some dough in the bottom of a cupboard drawer which I used as a trough; and then, under the ashes on the bricks, I made as well as I could, thick cakes, of which the outsides were burnt, and the insides hardly done enough.","They reminded me of those little round bits of dough that, as a child, I held in the tongs, and made into rolls about the size of a lozenge.",From time to time I get a windfall.,"For instance, the other day, as I was rummaging in the keeper’s house, I found on a damp and mouldy cupboard shelf a few bottles of walnut-spirit that had been overlooked by the plunderers; and another time I found a large sack, which I opened with a beating heart, thinking it contained potatoes.","I was quite startled on pulling out from it magpies’ beaks, vipers’ heads, dry and dust-coloured, squirrels’ tails, with their bushy red fur, and field-mice’s tails, as delicate as silken twist.","These are the keeper’s perquisites, as they are given so much for the head and tail of destructive animals.","They therefore keep these trophies of the chase very carefully, as they are paid for them by Government once a month.","—It always buys tobacco, as good old Guillard used to say.",[Picture: Robert exploring cupboards] I must confess that

gaze on roads and houses.","[Picture: Damaged door in house] I found the country as deserted and silent, and far more dreary than before.","The Prussians have only passed through, but they have left their mark everywhere.","It seemed the very picture of an Algerian village after a swarm of locusts, a bare, devastated, devoured, and riddled scene; the houses with doors and windows all wide open, even to the little iron gates of the kennels and the latticed shutters of the rabbit-hutches.",I went into some of the houses .,.,.,Our peasants are rather like the Arabs.,"They are seen in the fields, in the courtyards, on their thresholds, but they do not often admit a Parisian inside their doors.","Now I could thoroughly search into these unknown lives, these forsaken homes.","Their habits still clung to them, and could be traced in the mantelpieces dark with soot, the hanging ropes in the courtyards where the washing is dried, the now empty nails driven into the walls, and on the walnut table, by the marks idly cut with a knife, and the notches made between each mouthful.","All those village households were alike—I came upon one, however, that possessed one luxury more than the others—a parlour, or at least what was intended for a parlour.","In a small brick-floored room behind the kitchen, a green paper had been put up, coloured glass had been let into the window, and a pair of gilt fire-dogs, a round tea-table, and a large arm-chair covered with worn chintz, had been placed in it.",The ambition of a peasant’s lifetime could be felt there.,"Certainly that man had said to himself, “When I shall be old, when I shall have slaved and laboured hard, I will become a _bourgeois_.","I will have a parlour like the mayor, and a comfortable arm-chair to sit in.”  Poor devil!",They have made a fine mess of his parlour!,[Picture: A parlour in an abandoned house] I left Champrosay sad at heart.,The desolation of those abandoned houses had struck and chilled me like the cold damp falling from the walls of a cellar.,"Instead of going straight hack to the Hermitage, I went a long way round by the woods.",I felt a craving for air and Nature.,"Unluckily all this side of the forest bears an aspect of wildness and neglect, which is not very inspiriting.","Old and now unused quarries have left there piles of rocks, and a scattering of pebbles, which make the soil both dry and barren.",Not a single blade of grass is to be seen on the paths.,"Wild stocks, brambles, and ivy alone spring up from out of these large gaping holes, clinging by all their roots to the uneven edges of the stones, and through the bare and interwoven branches, the quarries appear still deeper.",For a short time we had been winding our way among the rocks.,"Suddenly Colaquet stopped short, and his ears began to tremble with fear.",What is the matter with him?,I lean forward and look .,.,.,It is the body of a Prussian soldier that has been pitched down head-foremost into the quarry.,I must confess it gave me a shudder.,"Had it been on the highway or in the plain, this corpse would not have horrified me so much.","Where there are so many soldiers and so many guns, the probability of death seems ever present; but here in this hollow, in this out-of-the-way part of the wood, it bore an appearance of murder and mystery .",.,.,"Looking more attentively, I thought I recognised my robber of the other day, he who was singing so lustily about the month of May.",Has he been killed by a peasant?,But where could the peasant have come from?,"There is nobody left at Champrosay, Minville, or the Meillottes.","More probably it is the result of some drunken quarrel between comrades, like the one I saw from the windows of the Hermitage .",.,.,"I went home very quickly; and all through the evening I was haunted by the idea that my only guest, my only companion in the whole of the dreary forest, was that dead body stretched out on the red sand of the quarries

earth even more than the air.","With my prison labour, my selfish and silent life in the midst of such a terrible drama, I compare myself to an ant, busily groping about on the surface of the soil, deaf to the sounds of humanity around it, all too great for its insignificance, and which surround without troubling it.","From time to time, to divert my thoughts, I take a journey to Champrosay without any fear of meeting the Prussians, who have decidedly abandoned the Corbeil road, and are making their descent on Paris by way of Melun and Villeneuve-Saint-Georges.","Once or twice, however, a horse’s gallop obliged me to take refuge in some shed, and I saw a rapid and hurried bearer of despatches riding across the country as if merely to unite it to headquarters, to take possession of the road, and mark it with the hoofs of the Prussian horses.","This deserted village, with its wide-open houses, interests and charms me like a sort of Pompeii.",I wander through and examine it.,I

ledge.","Moreover, he was well hidden away, thrust into oblivion in this small pond surrounded by brushwood, as securely as that other one over there, in the quarry in the wood.",I had by chance taken Colaquet to drink there.,"The sight of that long, motionless body startled me.","Were it not for the pool of blood which stained the stones round his head, and mingled with the reflection of the purple sunset in the water, it might have been supposed that he was asleep, so quiet and peaceful were his features.",I have often noticed that expression on the face of the dead.,"For the space of a brief moment there is something about them more beautiful than life: a solemn peace, a breathless slumber, a renewal of youth in the whole being, which seems like a pause between the agitations of life and the surprises of the unknown world opening before them.","[Picture: Colaquet about to drink] While I was contemplating the unfortunate creature, night began to close in.",In the clear and mellow twilight a great softness reigned over everything.,"The roads, already lighter than the sky, stretched out straight and regular.","The forest spread out in dark masses, and beneath me a small vineyard path was faintly lighted up by a ray of moonlight.","Over all Nature, reposing after the day’s labour—on the silent fields, the hushed river, the peaceful landscape gently fading into night—there was the same calm, the same grand peace that rested on the face of the dead soldier.",[Picture: Saxon corpse in the pond]                                 * * * * *

summer-time, at the end of the arch of green foliage, a mirror of blue water blended with a blue sky.",All the darkness of the old avenues seems to escape through these two vistas of light.,"At the entrance near the gates, a wide moat surrounding the lawns, a circle of moss-covered lime-trees and curbstones grazed by carriage-wheels, all combine to show the antiquity of this quiet old place.","A fancy took me, and the other day I went in there.",By a winding path I reached the front of the steps.,"The doors were open, the shutters broken.","On the ground-floor, in the large drawing-rooms, where the walls were all covered with white carved panels, not a single piece of furniture was left.","Nothing but straw, and on the façade, between the stone carving of the balconies, were fresh marks and scratches, showing how the furniture had been thrown out through the windows.",The billiard-room only was untouched.,"The Prussian officers are like our own, they are very fond of playing billiards.","Only these gentlemen had amused themselves by making a target of a large mirror, and with its scratches, its chipped fragments, its small round holes looking black in the light, the

dead leaves on to the floors.","Outside, it dashed under the green-leafed aisle, rocking a forgotten boat on the pond, full of broken twigs and golden-coloured willow-leaves.",I walked to the end of the avenues.,"There, at the end of the terrace, is a summer-house of red bricks overlooking the river; it is buried in the trees, and the Prussians have probably not seen it.","The door, however, is ajar.","I found a little sitting-room inside, hung with a flowery chintz, which seemed the continuation of the Virginian jasmine climbing through the latticed shutters; a piano, some scattered music, a book forgotten on a bamboo stool in front of the view over the Seine, and in the mysterious light of the closed shutters, the elegant and refined portrait of a woman looked out of a golden frame.","Wife or maiden, who can tell?","Dark, tall, with an ingenuous look, an enigmatic smile, and eyes the colour of thought—those Parisian eyes that change with each passing emotion.","It is the

attentively, ready to extinguish my fire and put out the little glimmer which might betray me.","Almost immediately, hurried footsteps sounding heavy on the gravelled road, approached the Hermitage,

wiped the blood off his hands.","—You are wounded, Goudeloup?",He laughed significantly.,—No—no .,.,.,I have just been bleeding one of them on the road.,Only this time I had not a fair chance.,"While I was at work, some others came up.",Never mind!,He will never get up again.,"And he added, with a short, fierce laugh which showed his wolfish-looking teeth: —That makes the fifteenth that I have

had me taken down only on account of my sign.,"[Picture: Robert meeting Goudeloup] “—You are a Freemason,” said he, in a low tone, and in excellent French.",“I am also one .,.,.,and I would not refuse to help a brother who appealed to me .,.,.,"Be off, and let me see you no more!",.,.,.” I left my own home hanging my head like a beggar.,"Only I did not go far, you may believe.","Hidden among the ruins of the bridge, living on raw turnips and sloes, I was present at the pillage of my goods; the emptied granaries, the pulley creaking all day long to lower the sacks, the wood burning in the open yard in large fires, round which they drank my wine, and my furniture and my flocks going of by degrees in every direction!","And when at last nothing remained, after setting fire to the house, they went off, driving and whipping my last cow before them.","That evening, when I had been round my ruins, when, thinking of my children, I realised that in my whole life long I should never make enough to restore my property, even if I killed myself with work, I became mad with rage.",The very first Prussian I met on the road I sprang upon like a wild beast and cut his throat with this .,.,.,From that moment I had but one idea—to hunt down the Prussians.,"I remained in ambush night and day, attacking the stragglers, the marauders, the despatch-bearers, the sentinels.",All those I kill I carry

spent a most dreadful week.,"During eight days, the Prussian patrols have unceasingly passed backwards and forwards through the forest.","They skirted the walls of the Hermitage, and even entered the enclosure, but the state of the keeper’s little house, left wide open and abandoned; the ivy and brambles giving such a dilapidated appearance to my own, protected us.","My companion and myself carefully remained inside the whole time, deadening our steps across the room, lowering our voices by the hearth, and only making a small fire at night.","[Picture: Jug] This time, had we been discovered, it meant death, and I felt rather annoyed with Goudeloup for having made me his accomplice by coming to take refuge here.","He understood my feelings, and offered several times to go and seek another shelter; but I would not consent to this.","To show his gratitude for my hospitality, he renders me a lot of little services.","Very obliging, very clever in all the practical details of life, about which I am so ignorant, he has taught me to make bread that is eatable, real cider, and candles.","It is a pleasure to see him busy all day long, restricting his faculty for work and order, which he formerly exercised on a wider scale in the management of his large farmstead and seventy-five acres of land, and adapting himself to the confined space of our only room.","Gloomy and silent, moreover, and sitting motionless for hours in the evening, his head buried in his hands, like all inveterate workers with whom overwrought physical life absorbs the moral being, I could not help sometimes smiling when I noticed that, notwithstanding the tragical circumstances surrounding us, he kept up his habit of prolonged meals and pauses between each mouthful.","Such as he is, the fellow interests me.",He is the true peasant in all his native brutality.,"His land, his goods, are far more precious to him than his country or his family.",He unconsciously utters the most monstrous sentiments.,"If he is so bent on revenge, it is only because the Prussians have burnt down his farm, and the horrors of the invasion only rouse him when he thinks of his lost harvest, and his fields

blue cloth of which the Prussian uniforms are made.","As he caught me sniffing the delightful fragrance of tobacco, which tantalised me, he said, with that cunning smile of the peasant which puckers

plain.",I found my boat in a little creek hidden between the banks.,It was a very lightly-built Norwegian boat.,"Having wrapped some rags round the oars, we pushed off noiselessly on the lonely river, knocking now and then against the icicles which float on the surface of the water like blocks of crystal.","Many a time, in preceding years, I had embarked on nights as dark and cold to set or visit my night-lines.",But what life there was on the river around me!,"A somewhat mysterious, dreamy sort of life, full of the silence of universal slumber.","Long wood rafts, with their fires lighted fore and aft, and shadows standing near the helm, slowly go down towards Paris, gliding by through all the forest shade, and entering Bercy at break of day, in the full glare of a noisy and crowded thoroughfare.","On the banks, waggons passed along, the night express train gliding along through the windings of the railway track, like a serpent with eyes of fire.",And I pondered over all the sad or joyful motives that set all these people in motion .,.,.,"At intervals, by the side of the river, which nearly bathed their walls, the lock-keeper’s house, the ferrymen’s hut, the boatmen’s public-houses, threw the glimmer from their dimmed windows over the still water.",[Picture: Wood rafts of former times] To-day there is nothing of all this.,"We have a new river before us, black and solitary, disturbed by all those broken bridges, which change the currents.","However, by a few strokes of the oar I was able to direct our little bark, and keep it near enough to the middle of the stream to avoid the submerged islands marked out by the dipping willows .",.,.,[Picture: “We crossed a heavy punt.”] —All goes well .,.,.,said Goudeloup in a low voice.,"At that moment the noise of an oar thrown into a boat, came from the bank, and a powerful southern voice called through the night: —Come, ferryman, make haste!",.,.,.,"—It is the Draveil doctor, whispered my companion.","I too had recognised the kindly voice, that is heard day and night on highroads and byeways, always encouraging and always hurried.",How did he come there?,Had he therefore stayed at Draveil?,.,.,.,"I should have liked to have called out to him: “Good-night, Doctor!”  But a moment’s reflection stopped me.","A lucky thought, in truth; for directly after we crossed a heavy punt, with a lantern in the bow, passing over from one side of the river to the other; and I saw by the side of dear Doctor R— in his old felt hat, weather-beaten by all the storms of Seine and Oise, some shining helmets.","[Picture: Approaching the railway bridge] By rare good fortune we were beyond the rays of their lantern, which deepened the shadow through which our boat was gliding, and we passed by unseen.","No less danger awaited us a little farther on—the railway bridge, of which three arches were blown up, blocking the river with its gigantic remains.","I really hardly know how we were able to get through this fearful barrier in the dark, without being swamped or dashed to pieces.",At Port-Courcelles we had the same fear.,"The enormous gnarled willows of the two islets became in the night so many shoals, that we narrowly escaped.",At last we reach Ablon and its lock.,"Here the cannon round Paris resounds clear and terrible, sending forth at each instant the red flash of its thunder .",.,.,We ought to have expected it: the lock is closed.,"Fortunately our boat is light, and together we shall be able, as I have so often done, to hoist it on to the bank, and carry it over to the other side of the barrier.","We land at the little steps where the innkeeper of Ablon skins his eels on summer days, and where the fishermen sit patiently with their rods, bathed in sunshine from the top of their boating-hats down to their shoes of untanned leather.",It is astonishing how a feeling of danger changes the whole aspect of things!,.,.,.,"When nearly at the top of the steps, I perceived against the darkness, ten paces from me, a sentry on his beat, pacing up and down the quay.","Lower down, the lock-keeper’s house, turned into a Prussian outpost, has all its windows lighted up.","I wish to go down quickly, re-embark, and gain the other bank; but Goudeloup will not listen to me.","His eyes remain obstinately fixed on that shadow which looms through the fog, and whistles while trampling above us.",I try to drag him away.,"He escapes, makes one bound .",.,.,"I hear a dull sound, a smothered cry, the rattle of arms, and the heavy fall of a man.",[Picture: The wrecked railway bridge] —Twenty-two!,.,.,.,"says Goudeloup, slipping, quite out of breath, down the slope.","But the unfortunate soldier, that he has left stretched out by the river-side, has found strength before dying to fire his gun.",The sharp report rouses both banks of the river.,Impossible to land.,"We quickly push out into the middle of the stream, and row hard up the river.",It is all like a bad dream.,"The wind and current, everything is against us.","A boat pushes off from the lock, coming straight at us, lighted by a torch which dips up and down as it watches for us, while another boat approaches us in a contrary direction.",—To the dredger .,.,.,whispers Goudeloup in my ear.,"[Picture: On the steps by the lock] Near us, moored some fifty or sixty feet from the shore, a dredging-boat reared its black mass above the water, with its barrels and bucket-chain to clear away the sand.","The Seine was very high, and the water half covered it, dashing against its bows with vehemence.","We board her, but in our haste to take refuge on this wreck we forget to fasten our boat, which floats off with the rugs and provision it contains.",This saves us.,Five minutes later a formidable “hurrah” tells us the Prussians have just found our boat.,"Seeing it empty, they must have thought we were drowned, engulfed; for a few moments after, the torches returned to the shore, and the whole river resumed its silence and darkness .",.,.,"[Picture: Swimming to the dredger] The dredger on which we found ourselves was a complete wreck—a curious shelter, crackling and creaking all over, and furiously lashed by the waters.","On the deck, covered with splinters of wood and pieces of cast iron, the cold was intolerable.","We were obliged to take refuge in the engine-room, to which the water happily had not yet penetrated.","It would soon, however, reach it, for in several places the sides of the room were cracked almost down to the level of the waves, and we found ourselves lighted by the leaden reflection of the darkness on the water.",What gloomy hours we spent there!,"Hunger, fear, and the terrible cold numbing our limbs with a feeling of drowsiness against which we were obliged to struggle .",.,.,"All around, the water seethed, the wood groaned, the bucket-chain creaked in its rustiness, and aloft, above our heads, something like the rag of a drenched flag flapped in the wind.","We impatiently waited for daybreak, not knowing exactly what distance separated us from the land, nor how we should be able to reach it.","In our fitful slumbers, broken as they were by anxious thoughts of escape, the shaking of the dredging-boat and the sound of the water surrounding us, gave me at times the impression of a long voyage and a stormy night at sea .",.,.,"When through the holes in the room, which were blackened and torn as if by a bombardment, we saw the river catch the first light of a sullen winter’s morning, we tried to make out our position.","The slopes of Juvisy commanded the farther bank, rising above the fog, which its tall trees pierced with their bare tops.","On the opposite shore, eighty or a hundred feet beyond the dredger, lay the flat, bare plains of Draveil, stretching away into the far distance, without trace of a soldier on them.",Evidently that was the side we could escape by.,"The anticipation of a cold bath, in the month of December, in that deep, foaming, and swift-running water, was rather terrifying.","However, the iron chain that moored the dredger to the bank was happily still fastened to its ring, and we had the resource left of clinging to it and being guided by it.","While we were discussing this, a cannon was fired off rather close at hand, from the heights of Juvisy, followed up immediately by the whistle of a shell and its splash in the water near us.","A few seconds later, before we had recovered from our astonishment, a second shell fell near the dredger.","Then I understood the flag, the splinters of wood, the pieces of cast iron, and the smell of burnt powder we had noticed in the cabin.",The Prussians were using the old dredger as a target for their cannons.,It was absolutely necessary to quit at once.,The cold and the dangers of the river sank into insignificance.,Forward we must go.,"I seized hold of the chain with both hands and lowered myself rapidly into the river, Goudeloup following me.","Our fingers were skinned by the chafing iron: we advanced but slowly, numbed by the current and the icy water.",A fresh cannon-shot redoubles our energy.,Look out!,Here comes the shell.,"This time it falls full on the iron-plated front of the dredger, bursts, and covers us with the wreckage.",I hear behind me a deep sigh .,.,.,"No, never shall I forget the last agonising motion of that chain, which I felt move, struggle for a second, and then rise up quickly in the water, loose, free, and light in my hands .",.,.,[Picture: They get into the river again] I turned round; no one to be seen.,Nothing but a mass of blood floating away on the stream.,The unfortunate fellow must have been struck on the head and killed on the spot .,.,.,A feeling of intense despair overcame me.,"My companion slaughtered beside me, and I helpless to succour him .",.,.,"A little more and I too must have let go the chain; but the instinct of life won the day, and a few minutes later I landed on the bank, but to get no farther.","After a dozen steps, overcome by the anxiety, fatigue, and terrible cold which penetrated through all my wet clothes, I dropped down by the roadside on the dry grass of a ditch.","The well-known trot of a horse, the roll of an old cabriolet, and the kind voice of Doctor R— drew me from my lethargy.",—What!,it is you?,.,.,.,What are you doing there?,"Quick as lightning, he wrapped me up in his cloak, hid me in the straw under the apron of the carriage, and set off in the direction of Draveil, where the excellent man has turned his house into a hospital.",From the cabriolet I passed into the coach-house.,"There, dry clothes and a few glasses of hot grog soon revived me.","I remained there till nightfall, without daring to move, understanding very well, although the Doctor had never told me, the risk he was incurring by receiving me.",The house was full of soldiers and hospital attendants.,Military boots resounded on the pavement of the small courtyard.,"And all around, the loud laughter, the swords clashing, and the harsh German speech, still more accentuated by its insolent tone.","I heard all this with my eyes shut, stupefied by the sensation of comfort, with a vague recollection of past danger and of the cold river, and poor Goudeloup’s heart-rending groan ringing in my ears.","At night the Doctor came to set me free, and took me to the room generally occupied by his grandchildren, whom he had sent away on the approach of the Prussians.",It was there that I awoke the next morning.,"After the horrible scenes of the previous day, those three little cribs, with white muslin curtains round them, the children’s toys lying scattered on the floor with their lesson-books, even the faint medicinal smell that came from a cupboard in which the Doctor kept some drugs, everything calmed and soothed my over-excited nerves.",In a neighbouring yard a cock crowed and a donkey began braying.,The village seemed to awaken.,"Suddenly a bugle-call, rudely jarring on these peaceful sounds, recalled the sad reality.",Then there was coming and going to and fro; doors banged .,.,.,I drew near the window.,"The Doctor’s house looked into the street, over the flower-beds of a narrow strip of garden in front of it.","Every one knew his house, with its round brass bell-knob standing out brightly on the freshly white-washed wall; and the furniture in the little parlour, which could be seen on the ground-floor, gave it an appearance of homely comfort.","Hidden behind the closed blinds, I saw the street full of men in forage-caps falling into line, calling, numbering each other, ready to start.","Among the caps, several Bavarian helmets appeared.","These were quartermasters running from house to house, chalking down the numbers on the doors, preparing quarters for the advancing forces.","Soon the departing regiment moved off to the sound of their drums, while opposite, at the entrance to the village, the Bavarian buglers noisily entered.",During the last three months the unhappy village had been in this condition.
