that is, an ever-burning fire.","(8) _""__The place was Witold's.__""_ [Witold, the son of Kiejstut, after rising over the heads of the other Lithuanian princes to the sovereignty of the whole country, was ultimately dispossessed by his cousin Jagellon, founder of the Jagellon dynasty, which reigned over Poland and Lithuania from 1386 to 1572.]","(9) _Song of the Wajdelote._ The Wajdelotes, Sigonoci, Lingustoni were priests whose office was to relate or sing to the people the acts of their forefathers at all festivals.","That the old Lithuanians and Prussians loved and cultivated poetry is proved by the enormous number of ancient songs, still remaining among the common people, and by the testimony of chroniclers.","We read that during a grand festival on the occasion of the election of the Grand-Master Winrych von Kniprode, a German Minnesinger, being honoured with applause and a gold cup, a Prussian named Rizelus, was so encouraged by this good reception of a poet, that he entreated for permission to sing in his native Lithuanian tongue, and celebrated the deeds of the first king of the Litwini, Wajdewut.","The Grand-Master and the knights, not understanding and disliking the Lithuanian speech, ridiculed the poet, and gave him a present of a plate of empty nutshells.","In Prussia the Crusaders forbade officials and all who approached the court to use the Lithuanian tongue, under penalty of death; they banished from the country, together with the Jews and gipsies, the Wajdelotes, or Lithuanian bards, who alone knew and could relate the national annals.","Again in Lithuania, after the introduction of the Christian faith and the Polish language, the ancient priests and the native speech fell into disrepute, and were forgotten; thence the common people, changed to serfs, and attached to the soil, having abandoned the sword, also forgot those chivalric songs.","Still something has remained of their ancient annals and heroic verse, long joined with superstition, communicated in secret to the people.","Simon Grunau, in the sixteenth century, came by accident on the Prussians at a solemnity, and with difficulty saved his life, on promising the peasants, that he never would reveal to any one what he should see or hear; then, after performing sacrifice, an old Wajdelote began to sing the deeds of the ancient Lithuanian heroes, mingling therewith prayers and moral instructions.","Grunau, who well understood Lithuanian, confesses that he never expected to hear anything similar from the lips of a Lithuanian, such was the beauty of the theme and the phraseology.","(10) _""__Stands visibly the pestilential maid.__""_ The common people in Lithuania figure pestilential air under the form of a maiden, whose appearance, here described according to the popular song, precedes a terrible sickness.","I quote, in substance at least, a ballad I once heard in Lithuania: --""In a village appeared the maiden of the pestilence; and, after her custom, thrusting her hand through door or window, and waving a red cloth, scattered death through the houses.","The inhabitants shut themselves up in a state of siege, but hunger and other necessities soon obliged them to neglect such means of safety; all therefore awaited death.","A certain gentleman, although well provided with victuals, and able to maintain a long while this strange siege, yet resolved to sacrifice himself for the good of his neighbours, took a sabre of the time of the Sigismonds, on which was the name of Jesus and the name of Mary, and thus armed, opened the window of the house.","The gentleman, with one stroke, cut off the spectre's hand, and got possession of the handkerchief.","It is true he died, and all his family died; but from that time the disease was never known in the village.""","This handkerchief was said to be preserved in the church, I do not recollect of what village.","In the East, before the appearance of the plague, a phantom with bats' wings is said to appear, and to point with its fingers at those condemned to die.","It appears as though popular imagination wished to present, by such images, that mysterious foreboding and strange anxiety which usually precedes great misfortune or destruction, and which often is shared, not by individuals only, but by whole nations.",Thus in Greece were forebodings of the long duration and terrible results of the Peloponnesian war; in the Roman Empire of the fall of monarchy; in America of the coming of the Spaniards.,"(11) _""__The trees of Bialowiez.__""_ [The trees here referred to are of an immense age and extra-ordinary height, challenging comparison with the giant trees of California.","Many of them were venerated as divinities by the pagans of Lithuania, in whose religion tree and serpent worship formed a prominent feature.","Oracles were supposed to be given from a peculiar species of oak, called Baublis, ever green both summer and winter.","In the trunk of one of these, cut down about the year 1845, there were counted 1417 rings.]","(12) _""__Do burn the German knights in sacrifice.__""_ The Lithuanians used to burn prisoners of war, especially Germans, as offerings to the gods.","For this purpose was set aside the leader, or the most distinguished of the knights for high descent and bravery; if several had become prisoners, the unfortunate victim was chosen by lot.","For example, after the victory of the Lithuanians over the Crusaders, in the year 1315, Stryjkowski says: ""And Litwa and Zmudz (Samogitia) after this victory, and after taking abundant spoil from their conquered and thunder-stricken foes, when they had paid to their gods sacrifices and the accustomed prayers, burnt alive a distinguished Crusader of the name of Gerard Rudde, the chief of the prisoners, with the horse on which he made war, and with the armour which he had worn, on a lofty pile of wood; and with the smoke they sent his soul to heaven, and scattered his body to the winds with the ashes.""","(13) _""__They gave me the name of Walter.__""_ Walter von Stadion, a German knight, taken prisoner by the Lithuanians, married the daughter of Kiejstut, and with her secretly departed from Lithuania.","It frequently occurred that Prussians and Lithuanians, carried off as children, and educated in Germany, returned to their country, and became the bitterest foes of the Germans.",Thus the Prussian Herkus Monte was remarkable in the annals of the Order.,(14) _War._ The picture of this war is drawn from history.,"[The circumstances of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow, no doubt largely furnished the painful and realistic details in the text.]","(15) _""__The secret tribunal descends to council.__""_ In the Middle Ages, when powerful dukes and barons frequently permitted themselves great crimes, when the power of ordinary tribunals was too weak to humble them, secret brotherhoods were formed, whose members, unknown to one another, bound themselves by oath to punish the guilty, not pardoning even their own friends or relatives.","As soon as the secret judges had pronounced the decree of death, the condemned man was made aware of it, by a voice calling under his windows, or somewhere in his presence, the word--_Weh!_ (woe!)","This word, three times repeated, was a warning that he who heard it should prepare for death, which he must infallibly and unexpectedly receive from an unknown hand.",The secret court was called the _fehm_ tribunal (Vehmgericht) or Westphalian.,It is difficult to determine its origin; according to some writers it was instituted by Charlemagne.,"At first necessary, it gave opportunity for many abuses later on, and governments were forced to exercise severity occasionally against the judges themselves, before this institution was completely overthrown.","[Scott's graphic description in ""Anne of Geierstein"" of the court and procedure of the Vehmgericht will be instantly suggested.]","(16) _""__A sudden cry.__""_     _--__""__What cleaves the silent air,_ _So madly shrill, so passing wild?_ _It was a woman's shriek, and ne'er_ _In madlier ascents rose despair;_ _And they who heard it as it passed,_ _In mercy wished it were the last.__""_--PARISINA.","[The coincidence, or borrowing of ideas, is manifest, but the image has been amplified and beautified in the Polish poem.]","_N.B._--In all the Polish words retained in the text, _j_ is pronounced like _y_, and _w_ like _v_.","PRINTED BY BALLANTYNE, HANSON AND CO.

War.,VI.,The Parting.,NOTES.,"Printed by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & Co.                           _Edinburgh and London_ AUTHOR’S PREFACE THE Lithuanian nation, formed out of the tribes of the Litwini, Prussians and Leti, not very numerous, settled in an inextensive country, not very fertile, long unknown to Europe, was called, about the thirteenth century, by the incursions of its neighbours, to a more active part.","When the Prussians submitted to the swords of the Teutonic knights, the Lithuanians, issuing from their forests and marshes, annihilated with sword and fire the neighbouring empires, and soon became terrible in the north.","History has not as yet satisfactorily explained by what means a nation so weak, and so long tributary to foreigners, was able all at once to oppose and threaten all its enemies—on one side, carrying on a constant and murderous war with the Teutonic Order; on the other, plundering Poland, exacting tribute from Great Novgorod, and pushing itself as far as the borders of the Wolga and the Crimean peninsula.","The brightest period of Lithuanian history occurs in the time of Olgierd and Witold, whose rule extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea.","But this monstrous empire, having sprung up too quickly, could not create in itself internal strength, to unite and invigorate its differing portions.","The Lithuanian nationality, spread over too large a surface of territory, lost its proper character.","The Litwini subjugated many Russian tribes, and entered into political relations with Poland.","The Slavs, long since Christians, stood in a higher degree of civilisation, and although conquered, or threatened by Lithuania, gained by gradual influence a moral preponderance over their strong, but barbarous tyrants, and absorbed them, as the Chinese their Tartar invaders.","The Jagellons, and their more powerful vassals, became Poles; many Lithuanian princes adopted the Russian religion, language, and nationality.","By these means the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ceased to be Lithuanian; the nation proper found itself within its former boundaries, its speech ceased to be the language of the court and nobility, and was only preserved among the common people.","Litwa presents the singular spectacle of a people which disappeared in the immensity of its conquests, as a brook sinks after an excessive overflow, and flows in a narrower bed than before.",The circumstances here mentioned are covered by some centuries.,"Both Lithuania, and her cruellest enemy, the Teutonic Order, have disappeared from the scene of political life; the relations between neighbouring nations are entirely changed; the interests and passions which kindled the wars of that time are now expired; even popular song has not preserved their memory.","Litwa is now entirely in the past: her history presents from this circumstance a happy theme for poetry; so that a poet, in singing of the events of that time, objects only of historic interest, must occupy himself with searching into, and with artfully rendering the subject, without summoning to his aid the interests, passions, or fashions of his readers.",For such subjects Schiller recommended poets to seek.,"“Was unsterblich im Gesang will leben, Muss im Leben untergehen.” TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE THE Teutonic Order, originally, like the Knights Hospitallers, established in the Holy Land about 1199, settled, after the cessation of the Crusades, in the country bordering upon the Baltic Sea, at the mouth of the Vistula, in the year 1225.","The possession of the Baltic shores, and of such lands as the Order should conquer from the pagan Prussians and Litwini, was assured to them by Konrad, Duke of Masowsze, brother to Leszek the White of Poland.","The fatal error thus committed, in abandoning a hold on the sea-coast, had afterwards a disastrous effect on the history of Poland.","The Order speedily made themselves masters of the whole country of Prussia, and were engaged in ceaseless war with the pagans of Lithuania, under pretext of their conversion; more frequently, it is however to be feared, for purposes of raid and plunder.","It is, in fact, upon record that a certain Lithuanian prince, who had offered to embrace Christianity for the purpose of recovering part of his territory conquered by the Order, upon finding that his conversion would produce no better disposition in them towards himself, declared his intention of abiding in paganism, with the remark that he saw it was no question of his faith, but of his possessions.","The plundering expeditions of the Teutonic knights up country, in which many of the chivalry of all Europe frequently bore a part, were termed _reyses_.",The English reader will remember how Chaucer’s knight had fought “aboven alle nations in Pruce.”                  “In _Lettow had he reysed_ and in Ruce.” Henry IV.,"also, during his banishment, fought in the ranks of the Order.","After the conversion of Lithuania, and the union of that country with Poland, the Teutonic knights were frequently engaged in hostilities with both powers combined, sustaining in the year 1410 a terrible defeat at Tannenberg in E. Prussia, from the forces of Jagellon.",In this battle it is worthy of note that the famous John Ziska was engaged.,In 1466 Casimir Jagellon inflicted heavy losses on the Order.,"After its secularisation in 1521, when the Grand-Master Albert embraced the reformed faith, the domains of E. Prussia were held as a fief from Poland.","In 1657 Prussia became an independent state under Frederick William, the great Elector.","It is curious to observe how the name of Prussia, originally that of a conquered, non-Germanic people, has become in our time that of the first German power in the world.","The historical circumstances on which the poem of “Konrad Wallenrod” is founded are thus detailed at length by the author himself, in the following postscript to the work:— “We have called our story historical, for the characters of the actors, and all the more important circumstances mentioned therein, are sketched according to history.","The contemporary chronicles, in fragmentary and broken portions, must be filled out sometimes only by guesses and conjectures, in order to create some historic entirety from them.","Although I have permitted myself conjectures in the history of Wallenrod, I hope to justify them by their likeness to truth.","According to the chronicle, Konrad Wallenrod was not descended from the family of Wallenrod renowned in Germany, though he gave himself out as a member of it.",He was said to have been born of some illicit connection.,"The royal chronicle says, ‘Er war ein Pfaffenkind.’ Concerning the character of this singular man, we read many and contradictory traditions.","The greater number of the chroniclers reproach him with pride, cruelty, drunkenness, severity towards his subordinates, little zeal for religion, and even with hatred for ecclesiastics.",‘Er war ein rechter Leuteschinder (library of Wallenrod).,"Nach Krieg, Zank, und Hader hat sein Herz immer gestanden; und ob er gleich ein Gott ergebener Mensch von wegen seines Ordens sein wollte, doch ist er allen frommen geistlichen Menschen Graüel gewesen.",(David Lucas).,"Er regierte nicht lange, denn Gott plagte ihn inwendig mit dem laufenden Feuer.’ On the other hand, contemporary writers ascribe to him greatness of intellect, courage, nobility, and force of character; since without rare qualities he could not have maintained his empire amid universal hatred and the disasters which he brought upon the Order.",Let us now consider the proceedings of Wallenrod.,"When he assumed the rule of the Order, the season appeared favourable for war with Lithuania, for Witold had promised himself to lead the Germans to Wilna, and liberally repay them for their assistance.","Wallenrod, however, delayed to go to war; and, what was worse, offended Witold, and reposed such careless confidence in him, that this prince, having secretly become reconciled to Jagellon, not only departed from Prussia, but on the road, entering the German castles, burnt them as an enemy, and slaughtered the garrisons.","In such an unimagined change of circumstances, it was needful to neglect the war, or undertake it with great prudence.","The Grand-Master proclaimed a crusade, wasted the treasures of the Order in preparation—5,000,000 marks—a sum at that time immeasurable, and marched towards Lithuania.","He could have captured Wilna, if he had not wasted time in banquets and waiting for auxiliaries.","Autumn came; Wallenrod, leaving the camp without provisions, retired in the greatest disorder to Prussia.","The chroniclers and later historians were not able to imagine the cause of this sudden departure, not finding in contemporary circumstances any cause therefor.",Some have assigned the flight of Wallenrod to derangement of intellect.,"All the contradictions mentioned in the character and conduct of our hero may be reconciled with each other, if we suppose that he was a Lithuanian, and that he had entered the Order to take vengeance on it; especially since his rule gave the severest shock to the power of the Order.","We suppose that Wallenrod was Walter Stadion (see note), shortening only by some years the time which passed between the departure of Walter from Lithuania, and the appearance of Konrad in Marienbourg.",Wallenrod died suddenly in the year 1394; strange events were said to have accompanied his death.,"‘Er starb,’ says the chronicle; ‘in Raserei ohne letzte Oehlung, ohne Priestersegen, kurz vor seinem Tode wütheten Stürme, Regensgüsse, Wasserfluthen; die Weichsel und die Nogat durchwühlten ihre Dämme; hingegen wühlten die gewässer sich eine neue Tiefe da, wo jetzt Pilau steht!’ Halban, or, as the chroniclers call him, Doctor Leander von Albanus, a monk, the solitary and inseparable companion of Wallenrod, though he assumed the appearance of piety, was according to the chroniclers a heretic, a pagan, and perhaps a wizard.","Concerning Halban’s death, there are no certain accounts.","Some write that he was drowned, others that he disappeared secretly, or was carried away by demons.","I have drawn the chronicles chiefly from the works of Kotzebue, ‘Preussens Geschichte, Belege und Erläuterungen.’ Hartknoch, in calling Wallenrod ‘unsinnig,’ gives a very short account of him.” As to the conditions under which the poem was written, it is perhaps needful to state that it was composed by Mickiewicz, during the term of his banishment into Russia, and was first published at St. Petersburg in the year 1828.","In the character of the hero of the story, and in various circumstances of the poem, it is impossible not to recognise the influence of Lord Byron’s poetry, which obtained so powerful an ascendency over the works and imaginations of the Continental romanticists, and had thus an influence over foreign literature not conceded in the poet’s own country.","The Byronic character, however, presents a far nobler aspect in the hands of the present author than in those of its original creator; for, instead of being the outcome of a mere morbid self-concentration, and brooding over personal wrongs, it is the result of a noble indignation for the sufferings of others, and is conjoined with a high purpose for good, even though such good be worked out by means in themselves doubtful or questionable.","We cannot pass by the subject without saying a word as to the undercurrent of political meaning in “Konrad Wallenrod,” which fortunately escaped the rigid censorship of the Russian press.","Lithuania, conquered and oppressed by the Teutonic Order, is Poland, subjugated by Russia; and the numerous expressions of hatred for oppressors and love of an unhappy country woven into the substance of the narrative must be read as the utterances of a Pole against Russian tyranny.","The underhand machinations of the concealed enemy against the state in which he is a powerful leader, may be held to figure that intricate web of intrigue and conspiracy which Russian liberalism is gradually weaving throughout the whole political system, and which is daily gaining influence and power.","The character of Wallenrod is essentially the same as that of Cooper’s “Spy;” but we cannot suppose that the author intended to hold up trickery and deceit as praiseworthy and honourable, even though it is the sad necessity of slaves to use treachery as their only weapon; or that the Macchiavellian precept with which the story is headed is at all intended as one to be generally followed by seekers of political liberty against despotism.","The end and aim of this, as of all the works of Mickiewicz, is to show us a great and noble soul, noble in spite of many errors and vices, striving to work out a high ideal, and the fulfilment of a noble purpose; and to exhibit the heroism of renunciation of personal ease and enjoyment for the sake of the world’s or a nation’s good.","In regard to the method used in the English version, it is only necessary to add that as far as possible verbal accuracy in rendering has been endeavoured after; and an attempt, at least conscientious—whether or not partially successful must be left to the sentence of those qualified to form an opinion—has been made to reproduce as nearly as may be something of the original spirit In translating the main body of the narrative blank verse has been the medium employed, not as at all representing the beautiful and harmonious interchange of rhymes and play of rhythm so conspicuous in the Polish lines; but as securing, by reason of freedom from the necessity for rhymes, a truer verbal rendering, and as being the measure par excellence best suited to English narrative verse.","The “Wajdelote’s Tale” has for similar reasons been rendered into the same form, instead of being reproduced in the original hexameter stanza, as strange to the Polish as to the English tongue, wherein, despite the works of Longfellow and Clough, it can hardly be said to have yet become thoroughly naturalised.","Most of the lyrics are translated into the same metres as the originals, with the sole exception of the ballad of Alpujara.","This, as being upon a Spanish or Moorish subject, it was judged best to render into a form nearly resembling that of the ancient Spanish ballad, and employed by Bishop Percy in translation of the “Rio Verde,” and other poems from a like source.","Moreover, the original “Alpujara” is couched in a metre which, though extremely well suited to the Polish tongue, is difficult of imitation in English; or only to be imitated by great loss of accuracy in rendering.","In concluding, the translator begs to express a hope that this humble effort to present, however feebly, to the reading public of Great Britain an image of the work of the greatest of Polish poets, may, not be wholly unacceptable.","Any defects which the critical eye may note, must undoubtedly be laid rather to the charge of the copyist, than to the original of the great master.","I dare, however, to trust, that the shadow of so great a name, and the sincere wish to contribute this slender homage to the memory of one of Europe’s most illustrious writers, may serve as an excuse for over-presumption.","LONDON, _March_ 1882.",KONRAD WALLENROD                           _AN HISTORICAL TALE._                (FROM THE ANNALS OF LITHUANIA AND PRUSSIA.),"“Dovete adunque sapere come sono due generazioni da combattere... bisogna essere volpe e leone.”                                               MACCHIAVELLI, _Il Principe_.",INTRODUCTION.,"A HUNDRED years have passed since first the Order Waded in blood of Northern heathenesse;

many heroes there contend.","And all alike of noble race, and all Alike deserving in the Order’s cause.","But hitherto the brethren’s general voice Placed Wallenrod the highest over all A stranger he, in Prussia all unknown, But foreign houses of his fame were full2 Following the Moors upon Castilian sierras, The Ottoman through ocean’s troubled waves, In battle at the front, first on the wall, To grapple vessels of the infidel The first; and in the tourney, soon as he Entered the lists and deigned his visor raise, None dared with him the strife of keen-edged swords,3 By one accord the victor’s garland yielding.","But not alone amid Crusading hosts He with the sword had glorified his youth; For many Christian graces him adorn, Poverty, humbleness, of earth disdain.","But Konrad shone not in the courtly crowd By polished speech, by well-turned reverence; Nor e’er his sword for vile advantage sold To service of disputing barons.","He Had consecrated to the cloister walls His youthful years; all plaudits he disdained, And ruler’s place, even higher, sweeter meeds.","Nor minstrel’s hymn, nor beauty’s fair regard Could speak to his cold spirit.","Wallenrod Listens unmoved to praise, and looks afar On lovely cheeks, enchanting discourse flies.","Had Nature made him thus unfeeling, proud?",Or age?,"For albeit young in years, his locks Were grey already, withered were his looks, And sufferings sealed by age.—Twere hard to guess.","He would at times divide the sports of youth, Or listen, pleased, to sound of female tongues, To courtiers’ jests reply with other jests; Or scatter unto ladies courteous words With chilly smile, as dainties cast to children— These were rare moments of forgetfulness;— And speedily some light, unmeaning word, That had no sense for others, woke in him Passionate stirrings.","These words: Fatherland, Duty, Beloved,—the mention of Crusades, And Litwa, all the mirth of Wallenrod Instantly poisoned.","Hearing them, again He turned away his countenance, again Became to all around insensible, And buried him in thoughts mysterious.","Maybe, remembering his holy call, He would forbid himself the sweets of earth; The sweets of friendship only did he know, One only friend had chosen to himself, A saint by virtue and by holy state.",This was a hoary monk; men called him Halban.,"He shared the loneliness of Wallenrod;

And then he seemed a new form to indue, And then his visage pallid and severe A sickly red adorned, and his large eyes, Erst heavenly blue, but somewhat now by time Dulled and extinguished, shot the lightnings forth Of ancient fires, while sighs of grief escape From forth his breast, and with the pearly tear The laden eyelid swells; the hand the lute Seeks, the lips pour forth songs; the songs are sung In speech of a strange land, but yet the hearts Of the hearers understand them.","’Tis enough To list that grave-like music, ’tis enough The singer’s form to contemplate, to see Memory’s inspiration on that face, To view the lifted brows and sideward looks, Striving to snatch some object from deep darkness.",What may the hidden thread be of the songs?,"He tracketh surely, in this wandering chase, In thought his youth through deep gulfs of the past.",Where is his soul?—In the land of memories!,"But never did that hand in music’s impulse Mere joyful tones from out the lute evoke; And still it seemed his countenance did fear Innocent smiles, even as deadly sins.","All strings he strikes in turn, one string except— Except the string of mirth;—the hearer shares All feelings with him,—one excepted—hope!","Not seldom him the brethren have surprised, And marvelled at his unaccustomed change.","Konrad, aroused, did writhe himself and rage, Had cast away the lute and ceased to sing.","He spoke out loudly impious words; to Halban Whispered some secret things; called to the host, Gave forth commands, and uttered dreadful threats, On whom they knew not.",All their hearts were troubled.,"Old Halban tranquil sits, and on the face Of Konrad drowns his glance,—a piercing glance, Cold and severe, full of some secret speech.","Something he may recall, some counsel give, Or waken grief in heart of Wallenrod, Whose cloudy brow at once is calm again, His eyes forego their fires, his rage is cool.","Thus when, in public sport, the lionward, Before assembled lords, and dames, and knights, Unbars the grating of the iron cage.","The trumpet signal given, the royal beast Growls from his deep breast, horror falls on all.","Alone his keeper moveth not a step, Folds tranquilly upon his breast his hands, And smites with power the lion,—by the eye.",With talisman of an undying soul Unreasoning strength in bonds he doth control.,II.,"In towers of Marienbourg the bells are ringing;

that is, an ever-burning fire.","(8) _“__The place was Witold’s.__”_ [Witold, the son of Kiejstut, after rising over the heads of the other Lithuanian princes to the sovereignty of the whole country, was ultimately dispossessed by his cousin Jagellon, founder of the Jagellon dynasty, which reigned over Poland and Lithuania from 1386 to 1572.]","(9) _Song of the Wajdelote._ The Wajdelotes, Sigonoci, Lingustoni were priests whose office was to relate or sing to the people the acts of their forefathers at all festivals.","That the old Lithuanians and Prussians loved and cultivated poetry is proved by the enormous number of ancient songs, still remaining among the common people, and by the testimony of chroniclers.","We read that during a grand festival on the occasion of the election of the Grand-Master Winrych von Kniprode, a German Minnesinger, being honoured with applause and a gold cup, a Prussian named Rizelus, was so encouraged by this good reception of a poet, that he entreated for permission to sing in his native Lithuanian tongue, and celebrated the deeds of the first king of the Litwini, Wajdewut.","The Grand-Master and the knights, not understanding and disliking the Lithuanian speech, ridiculed the poet, and gave him a present of a plate of empty nutshells.","In Prussia the Crusaders forbade officials and all who approached the court to use the Lithuanian tongue, under penalty of death; they banished from the country, together with the Jews and gipsies, the Wajdelotes, or Lithuanian bards, who alone knew and could relate the national annals.","Again in Lithuania, after the introduction of the Christian faith and the Polish language, the ancient priests and the native speech fell into disrepute, and were forgotten; thence the common people, changed to serfs, and attached to the soil, having abandoned the sword, also forgot those chivalric songs.","Still something has remained of their ancient annals and heroic verse, long joined with superstition, communicated in secret to the people.","Simon Grunau, in the sixteenth century, came by accident on the Prussians at a solemnity, and with difficulty saved his life, on promising the peasants, that he never would reveal to any one what he should see or hear; then, after performing sacrifice, an old Wajdelote began to sing the deeds of the ancient Lithuanian heroes, mingling therewith prayers and moral instructions.","Grunau, who well understood Lithuanian, confesses that he never expected to hear anything similar from the lips of a Lithuanian, such was the beauty of the theme and the phraseology.","(10) _“__Stands visibly the pestilential maid.__”_ The common people in Lithuania figure pestilential air under the form of a maiden, whose appearance, here described according to the popular song, precedes a terrible sickness.","I quote, in substance at least, a ballad I once heard in Lithuania: —“In a village appeared the maiden of the pestilence; and, after her custom, thrusting her hand through door or window, and waving a red cloth, scattered death through the houses.","The inhabitants shut themselves up in a state of siege, but hunger and other necessities soon obliged them to neglect such means of safety; all therefore awaited death.","A certain gentleman, although well provided with victuals, and able to maintain a long while this strange siege, yet resolved to sacrifice himself for the good of his neighbours, took a sabre of the time of the Sigismonds, on which was the name of Jesus and the name of Mary, and thus armed, opened the window of the house.","The gentleman, with one stroke, cut off the spectre’s hand, and got possession of the handkerchief.","It is true he died, and all his family died; but from that time the disease was never known in the village.” This handkerchief was said to be preserved in the church, I do not recollect of what village.","In the East, before the appearance of the plague, a phantom with bats’ wings is said to appear, and to point with its fingers at those condemned to die.","It appears as though popular imagination wished to present, by such images, that mysterious foreboding and strange anxiety which usually precedes great misfortune or destruction, and which often is shared, not by individuals only, but by whole nations.",Thus in Greece were forebodings of the long duration and terrible results of the Peloponnesian war; in the Roman Empire of the fall of monarchy; in America of the coming of the Spaniards.,"(11) _“__The trees of Bialowiez.__”_ [The trees here referred to are of an immense age and extra-ordinary height, challenging comparison with the giant trees of California.","Many of them were venerated as divinities by the pagans of Lithuania, in whose religion tree and serpent worship formed a prominent feature.","Oracles were supposed to be given from a peculiar species of oak, called Baublis, ever green both summer and winter.","In the trunk of one of these, cut down about the year 1845, there were counted 1417 rings.]","(12) _“__Do burn the German knights in sacrifice.__”_ The Lithuanians used to burn prisoners of war, especially Germans, as offerings to the gods.","For this purpose was set aside the leader, or the most distinguished of the knights for high descent and bravery; if several had become prisoners, the unfortunate victim was chosen by lot.","For example, after the victory of the Lithuanians over the Crusaders, in the year 1315, Stryjkowski says: “And Litwa and Zmudz (Samogitia) after this victory, and after taking abundant spoil from their conquered and thunder-stricken foes, when they had paid to their gods sacrifices and the accustomed prayers, burnt alive a distinguished Crusader of the name of Gerard Rudde, the chief of the prisoners, with the horse on which he made war, and with the armour which he had worn, on a lofty pile of wood; and with the smoke they sent his soul to heaven, and scattered his body to the winds with the ashes.” (13) _“__They gave me the name of Walter.__”_ Walter von Stadion, a German knight, taken prisoner by the Lithuanians, married the daughter of Kiejstut, and with her secretly departed from Lithuania.","It frequently occurred that Prussians and Lithuanians, carried off as children, and educated in Germany, returned to their country, and became the bitterest foes of the Germans.",Thus the Prussian Herkus Monte was remarkable in the annals of the Order.,(14) _War._ The picture of this war is drawn from history.,"[The circumstances of Napoleon’s retreat from Moscow, no doubt largely furnished the painful and realistic details in the text.]","(15) _“__The secret tribunal descends to council.__”_ In the Middle Ages, when powerful dukes and barons frequently permitted themselves great crimes, when the power of ordinary tribunals was too weak to humble them, secret brotherhoods were formed, whose members, unknown to one another, bound themselves by oath to punish the guilty, not pardoning even their own friends or relatives.","As soon as the secret judges had pronounced the decree of death, the condemned man was made aware of it, by a voice calling under his windows, or somewhere in his presence, the word—_Weh!_ (woe!)","This word, three times repeated, was a warning that he who heard it should prepare for death, which he must infallibly and unexpectedly receive from an unknown hand.",The secret court was called the _fehm_ tribunal (Vehmgericht) or Westphalian.,It is difficult to determine its origin; according to some writers it was instituted by Charlemagne.,"At first necessary, it gave opportunity for many abuses later on, and governments were forced to exercise severity occasionally against the judges themselves, before this institution was completely overthrown.",[Scott’s graphic description in “Anne of Geierstein” of the court and procedure of the Vehmgericht will be instantly suggested.],"(16) _“__A sudden cry.__”_     _—__“__What cleaves the silent air,_ _So madly shrill, so passing wild?_ _It was a woman’s shriek, and ne’er_ _In madlier ascents rose despair;_ _And they who heard it as it passed,_ _In mercy wished it were the last.__”_—PARISINA.","[The coincidence, or borrowing of ideas, is manifest, but the image has been amplified and beautified in the Polish poem.]","_N.B._—In all the Polish words retained in the text, _j_ is pronounced like _y_, and _w_ like _v_.","PRINTED BY BALLANTYNE, HANSON AND CO.

War.,VI.,The Parting.,NOTES.,"Printed by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & Co.                           _Edinburgh and London_ AUTHOR'S PREFACE THE Lithuanian nation, formed out of the tribes of the Litwini, Prussians and Leti, not very numerous, settled in an inextensive country, not very fertile, long unknown to Europe, was called, about the thirteenth century, by the incursions of its neighbours, to a more active part.","When the Prussians submitted to the swords of the Teutonic knights, the Lithuanians, issuing from their forests and marshes, annihilated with sword and fire the neighbouring empires, and soon became terrible in the north.","History has not as yet satisfactorily explained by what means a nation so weak, and so long tributary to foreigners, was able all at once to oppose and threaten all its enemies--on one side, carrying on a constant and murderous war with the Teutonic Order; on the other, plundering Poland, exacting tribute from Great Novgorod, and pushing itself as far as the borders of the Wolga and the Crimean peninsula.","The brightest period of Lithuanian history occurs in the time of Olgierd and Witold, whose rule extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea.","But this monstrous empire, having sprung up too quickly, could not create in itself internal strength, to unite and invigorate its differing portions.","The Lithuanian nationality, spread over too large a surface of territory, lost its proper character.","The Litwini subjugated many Russian tribes, and entered into political relations with Poland.","The Slavs, long since Christians, stood in a higher degree of civilisation, and although conquered, or threatened by Lithuania, gained by gradual influence a moral preponderance over their strong, but barbarous tyrants, and absorbed them, as the Chinese their Tartar invaders.","The Jagellons, and their more powerful vassals, became Poles; many Lithuanian princes adopted the Russian religion, language, and nationality.","By these means the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ceased to be Lithuanian; the nation proper found itself within its former boundaries, its speech ceased to be the language of the court and nobility, and was only preserved among the common people.","Litwa presents the singular spectacle of a people which disappeared in the immensity of its conquests, as a brook sinks after an excessive overflow, and flows in a narrower bed than before.",The circumstances here mentioned are covered by some centuries.,"Both Lithuania, and her cruellest enemy, the Teutonic Order, have disappeared from the scene of political life; the relations between neighbouring nations are entirely changed; the interests and passions which kindled the wars of that time are now expired; even popular song has not preserved their memory.","Litwa is now entirely in the past: her history presents from this circumstance a happy theme for poetry; so that a poet, in singing of the events of that time, objects only of historic interest, must occupy himself with searching into, and with artfully rendering the subject, without summoning to his aid the interests, passions, or fashions of his readers.",For such subjects Schiller recommended poets to seek.,"""Was unsterblich im Gesang will leben, Muss im Leben untergehen.""","TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE THE Teutonic Order, originally, like the Knights Hospitallers, established in the Holy Land about 1199, settled, after the cessation of the Crusades, in the country bordering upon the Baltic Sea, at the mouth of the Vistula, in the year 1225.","The possession of the Baltic shores, and of such lands as the Order should conquer from the pagan Prussians and Litwini, was assured to them by Konrad, Duke of Masowsze, brother to Leszek the White of Poland.","The fatal error thus committed, in abandoning a hold on the sea-coast, had afterwards a disastrous effect on the history of Poland.","The Order speedily made themselves masters of the whole country of Prussia, and were engaged in ceaseless war with the pagans of Lithuania, under pretext of their conversion; more frequently, it is however to be feared, for purposes of raid and plunder.","It is, in fact, upon record that a certain Lithuanian prince, who had offered to embrace Christianity for the purpose of recovering part of his territory conquered by the Order, upon finding that his conversion would produce no better disposition in them towards himself, declared his intention of abiding in paganism, with the remark that he saw it was no question of his faith, but of his possessions.","The plundering expeditions of the Teutonic knights up country, in which many of the chivalry of all Europe frequently bore a part, were termed _reyses_.","The English reader will remember how Chaucer's knight had fought ""aboven alle nations in Pruce.""","""In _Lettow had he reysed_ and in Ruce.""",Henry IV.,"also, during his banishment, fought in the ranks of the Order.","After the conversion of Lithuania, and the union of that country with Poland, the Teutonic knights were frequently engaged in hostilities with both powers combined, sustaining in the year 1410 a terrible defeat at Tannenberg in E. Prussia, from the forces of Jagellon.",In this battle it is worthy of note that the famous John Ziska was engaged.,In 1466 Casimir Jagellon inflicted heavy losses on the Order.,"After its secularisation in 1521, when the Grand-Master Albert embraced the reformed faith, the domains of E. Prussia were held as a fief from Poland.","In 1657 Prussia became an independent state under Frederick William, the great Elector.","It is curious to observe how the name of Prussia, originally that of a conquered, non-Germanic people, has become in our time that of the first German power in the world.","The historical circumstances on which the poem of ""Konrad Wallenrod"" is founded are thus detailed at length by the author himself, in the following postscript to the work:-- ""We have called our story historical, for the characters of the actors, and all the more important circumstances mentioned therein, are sketched according to history.","The contemporary chronicles, in fragmentary and broken portions, must be filled out sometimes only by guesses and conjectures, in order to create some historic entirety from them.","Although I have permitted myself conjectures in the history of Wallenrod, I hope to justify them by their likeness to truth.","According to the chronicle, Konrad Wallenrod was not descended from the family of Wallenrod renowned in Germany, though he gave himself out as a member of it.",He was said to have been born of some illicit connection.,"The royal chronicle says, 'Er war ein Pfaffenkind.'","Concerning the character of this singular man, we read many and contradictory traditions.","The greater number of the chroniclers reproach him with pride, cruelty, drunkenness, severity towards his subordinates, little zeal for religion, and even with hatred for ecclesiastics.",'Er war ein rechter Leuteschinder (library of Wallenrod).,"Nach Krieg, Zank, und Hader hat sein Herz immer gestanden; und ob er gleich ein Gott ergebener Mensch von wegen seines Ordens sein wollte, doch ist er allen frommen geistlichen Menschen Graüel gewesen.",(David Lucas).,"Er regierte nicht lange, denn Gott plagte ihn inwendig mit dem laufenden Feuer.'","On the other hand, contemporary writers ascribe to him greatness of intellect, courage, nobility, and force of character; since without rare qualities he could not have maintained his empire amid universal hatred and the disasters which he brought upon the Order.",Let us now consider the proceedings of Wallenrod.,"When he assumed the rule of the Order, the season appeared favourable for war with Lithuania, for Witold had promised himself to lead the Germans to Wilna, and liberally repay them for their assistance.","Wallenrod, however, delayed to go to war; and, what was worse, offended Witold, and reposed such careless confidence in him, that this prince, having secretly become reconciled to Jagellon, not only departed from Prussia, but on the road, entering the German castles, burnt them as an enemy, and slaughtered the garrisons.","In such an unimagined change of circumstances, it was needful to neglect the war, or undertake it with great prudence.","The Grand-Master proclaimed a crusade, wasted the treasures of the Order in preparation--5,000,000 marks--a sum at that time immeasurable, and marched towards Lithuania.","He could have captured Wilna, if he had not wasted time in banquets and waiting for auxiliaries.","Autumn came; Wallenrod, leaving the camp without provisions, retired in the greatest disorder to Prussia.","The chroniclers and later historians were not able to imagine the cause of this sudden departure, not finding in contemporary circumstances any cause therefor.",Some have assigned the flight of Wallenrod to derangement of intellect.,"All the contradictions mentioned in the character and conduct of our hero may be reconciled with each other, if we suppose that he was a Lithuanian, and that he had entered the Order to take vengeance on it; especially since his rule gave the severest shock to the power of the Order.","We suppose that Wallenrod was Walter Stadion (see note), shortening only by some years the time which passed between the departure of Walter from Lithuania, and the appearance of Konrad in Marienbourg.",Wallenrod died suddenly in the year 1394; strange events were said to have accompanied his death.,"'Er starb,' says the chronicle; 'in Raserei ohne letzte Oehlung, ohne Priestersegen, kurz vor seinem Tode wütheten Stürme, Regensgüsse, Wasserfluthen; die Weichsel und die Nogat durchwühlten ihre Dämme; hingegen wühlten die gewässer sich eine neue Tiefe da, wo jetzt Pilau steht!'","Halban, or, as the chroniclers call him, Doctor Leander von Albanus, a monk, the solitary and inseparable companion of Wallenrod, though he assumed the appearance of piety, was according to the chroniclers a heretic, a pagan, and perhaps a wizard.","Concerning Halban's death, there are no certain accounts.","Some write that he was drowned, others that he disappeared secretly, or was carried away by demons.","I have drawn the chronicles chiefly from the works of Kotzebue, 'Preussens Geschichte, Belege und Erläuterungen.'","Hartknoch, in calling Wallenrod 'unsinnig,' gives a very short account of him.""","As to the conditions under which the poem was written, it is perhaps needful to state that it was composed by Mickiewicz, during the term of his banishment into Russia, and was first published at St. Petersburg in the year 1828.","In the character of the hero of the story, and in various circumstances of the poem, it is impossible not to recognise the influence of Lord Byron's poetry, which obtained so powerful an ascendency over the works and imaginations of the Continental romanticists, and had thus an influence over foreign literature not conceded in the poet's own country.","The Byronic character, however, presents a far nobler aspect in the hands of the present author than in those of its original creator; for, instead of being the outcome of a mere morbid self-concentration, and brooding over personal wrongs, it is the result of a noble indignation for the sufferings of others, and is conjoined with a high purpose for good, even though such good be worked out by means in themselves doubtful or questionable.","We cannot pass by the subject without saying a word as to the undercurrent of political meaning in ""Konrad Wallenrod,"" which fortunately escaped the rigid censorship of the Russian press.","Lithuania, conquered and oppressed by the Teutonic Order, is Poland, subjugated by Russia; and the numerous expressions of hatred for oppressors and love of an unhappy country woven into the substance of the narrative must be read as the utterances of a Pole against Russian tyranny.","The underhand machinations of the concealed enemy against the state in which he is a powerful leader, may be held to figure that intricate web of intrigue and conspiracy which Russian liberalism is gradually weaving throughout the whole political system, and which is daily gaining influence and power.","The character of Wallenrod is essentially the same as that of Cooper's ""Spy;"" but we cannot suppose that the author intended to hold up trickery and deceit as praiseworthy and honourable, even though it is the sad necessity of slaves to use treachery as their only weapon; or that the Macchiavellian precept with which the story is headed is at all intended as one to be generally followed by seekers of political liberty against despotism.","The end and aim of this, as of all the works of Mickiewicz, is to show us a great and noble soul, noble in spite of many errors and vices, striving to work out a high ideal, and the fulfilment of a noble purpose; and to exhibit the heroism of renunciation of personal ease and enjoyment for the sake of the world's or a nation's good.","In regard to the method used in the English version, it is only necessary to add that as far as possible verbal accuracy in rendering has been endeavoured after; and an attempt, at least conscientious--whether or not partially successful must be left to the sentence of those qualified to form an opinion--has been made to reproduce as nearly as may be something of the original spirit In translating the main body of the narrative blank verse has been the medium employed, not as at all representing the beautiful and harmonious interchange of rhymes and play of rhythm so conspicuous in the Polish lines; but as securing, by reason of freedom from the necessity for rhymes, a truer verbal rendering, and as being the measure par excellence best suited to English narrative verse.","The ""Wajdelote's Tale"" has for similar reasons been rendered into the same form, instead of being reproduced in the original hexameter stanza, as strange to the Polish as to the English tongue, wherein, despite the works of Longfellow and Clough, it can hardly be said to have yet become thoroughly naturalised.","Most of the lyrics are translated into the same metres as the originals, with the sole exception of the ballad of Alpujara.","This, as being upon a Spanish or Moorish subject, it was judged best to render into a form nearly resembling that of the ancient Spanish ballad, and employed by Bishop Percy in translation of the ""Rio Verde,"" and other poems from a like source.","Moreover, the original ""Alpujara"" is couched in a metre which, though extremely well suited to the Polish tongue, is difficult of imitation in English; or only to be imitated by great loss of accuracy in rendering.","In concluding, the translator begs to express a hope that this humble effort to present, however feebly, to the reading public of Great Britain an image of the work of the greatest of Polish poets, may, not be wholly unacceptable.","Any defects which the critical eye may note, must undoubtedly be laid rather to the charge of the copyist, than to the original of the great master.","I dare, however, to trust, that the shadow of so great a name, and the sincere wish to contribute this slender homage to the memory of one of Europe's most illustrious writers, may serve as an excuse for over-presumption.","LONDON, _March_ 1882.",KONRAD WALLENROD                           _AN HISTORICAL TALE._                (FROM THE ANNALS OF LITHUANIA AND PRUSSIA.),"""Dovete adunque sapere come sono due generazioni da combattere... bisogna essere volpe e leone.""","MACCHIAVELLI, _Il Principe_.",INTRODUCTION.,"A HUNDRED years have passed since first the Order Waded in blood of Northern heathenesse;

For many Christian graces him adorn, Poverty, humbleness, of earth disdain.","But Konrad shone not in the courtly crowd By polished speech, by well-turned reverence; Nor e'er his sword for vile advantage sold To service of disputing barons.","He Had consecrated to the cloister walls His youthful years;

And then he seemed a new form to indue, And then his visage pallid and severe A sickly red adorned, and his large eyes, Erst heavenly blue, but somewhat now by time Dulled and extinguished, shot the lightnings forth Of ancient fires, while sighs of grief escape From forth his breast, and with the pearly tear The laden eyelid swells;
