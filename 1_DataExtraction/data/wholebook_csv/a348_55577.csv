But what does that signify to young love?,"You all know, signors, how little love requires; I was insistent and got my way.","""'Yes, perhaps you are right,' said Ida at last.","'If the Holy Mother helps you and me now when we live apart, it will be much easier for her to help us when we live together.'","""We decided upon it and went to the priest.","""'This is madness!'",said the priest.,'Aren't there beggars enough in Liguria?,"Unhappy people, playthings of the devil, you must struggle against his snares or you will pay dearly for your weakness.'","""All the youths in the commune jeered at us, and all the old people shook their heads, I can tell you.",But youth is obstinate and will have its way!,The wedding day drew near;

please pay attention; this is the best story of my long life.","Early in the morning of the day before our wedding the old man Giovanni, for whom I worked, said to me like this, his pipe between his teeth, as if he were speaking about trifles: ""'Ugo, you had better go and clean out the old sheep-shed and put some straw in it.","Although it is dry there, and no sheep have been in it for over a year, it ought to be cleaned out properly if you want to live in it with Ida.'","""Thus we had a house!","""As I worked and sang, the carpenter Constanzio stood in the door and asked: ""'Are you going to live here with Ida?",Where is your bed?,You must come to me when you have finished and get one from me--I have one to spare.',"""As I went to his house Mary, the bad-tempered shopkeeper, shouted: ""'The wretched sillies get married and don't possess a sheet, or pillow, or anything else!","You are quite crazy, you one-eyed fellow!",Send your sweetheart to me.',"""And Ettore Viano, tortured by rheumatism and fever, shouted from the threshold of his house: ""'Ask him whether he has saved up much wine for the guests!","Oh, good people, who could be more light-headed than these two?'""","In a deep wrinkle on the old man's cheek glistened a tear of happiness; he threw back his head and laughed noiselessly, pawing his old throat and the flabby skin of his face; his arms were as restless as a child's.","""Oh, signors, signors!""","said he, laughing and catching his breath.","""On our wedding morn we had everything that was wanted for a home--a statue of the Madonna, crockery, linen, furniture--everything, I swear!","Ida wept and laughed, and so did I, and everybody laughed--it is not the thing to weep on one's wedding day, and they all laughed at us!","""Signors, words cannot tell how sweet it is to be able to say 'our' people.","It is better still _to feel_ that they are 'yours,' near and dear to you, your kindred, for whom your life is no joking matter, your happiness no plaything!",And the wedding took place!,It was a great day.,"The whole commune turned out to see us, and everybody came to our shed, which had become a rich house, as in a fairy-tale.","We had everything: wine and fruit, meat and bread, and all ate and were merry.","There is no greater happiness, signors, than to do good to others;

all are intoxicated with the spirit of spring-time, talking, laughing, singing in joyous confusion, as if they were a single body overflowing with the zest of life.","The hats and parasols of the women make a medley of bright colours; red and blue balloons, like wonderful flowers, float from the hands of the children; and children, merry lords of the earth, laughing and rejoicing, are everywhere, like gems on the gorgeous cloak of a fairy prince.","The tender green leaves of the trees have not yet unfolded; they are sheathed in gorgeous buds, greedily drinking in the warm rays of the sun.",Far off the sun smiles gently and seems to beckon us.,"The impression seems to prevail that people have outlived their misfortunes, that yesterday was the last day of the hard shameful life that wearied them to death.","To-day they have all awakened in high spirits, like schoolboys, with a strong, clear faith in themselves, in the invincibility of their will to overcome all obstacles, and now, all together, they march boldly into the future.","It was strange--strange and sad and suddenly depressing--to notice a sorrowful face in this lively crowd: it was that of a tall, strongly built man, not yet over thirty but already grey, who passed arm-in-arm with a young woman.","He carried his hat in his hand, the hair on his shapely head glistened like silver, his thin but healthy face was calm and destined to remain for ever sad.","The eyes, large and dark, and shaded by long lashes, were those of a man who cannot forget--who will never forget--the acute suffering through which he has passed.","""Notice that couple,"" said my companion to me, ""especially the man: he has lived through one of those dramas which are enacted more and more frequently amongst the workers of Northern Italy.""","And my companion went on: That man is a socialist, the editor of a local Labour paper, a workman himself, a painter.","He is one of those characters for whom science becomes a religion, and a religion that still more incites the thirst for knowledge.",A keen and clever Anti-Clerical he was--just note what fierce looks the black priests send after him.,"About five years ago he, a propagandist, met in one of his circles a girl who at once attracted his attention.","Here women have learnt to believe silently and steadfastly; the priests have cultivated this ability in them for many centuries, and have achieved what they wished.",Somebody rightly said that the Catholic Church has been built up on the breast of womankind.,"The cult of the Madonna is not only beautiful, as such heathen practices go, it is first of all a clever cult.","The Madonna is simpler than Christ, she is nearer to one's heart, there are no contradictions in her, she does not threaten with Gehenna--she only loves, pities, forgives--it is easy for her to make a captive of a woman's heart for life.","But there he sees a girl who can speak, can inquire; and in all her questions he perceives, side by side with her naïve wonderment at his ideas, an undisguised lack of belief in him, and sometimes even fear and repulsion.","The Italian propagandist has to speak a great deal about religion, to say incisive things about the Pope and the clergy; every time he spoke on that subject he saw contempt and hate for him in the eyes of the girl; if she asked about anything her words sounded unfriendly and her soft voice breathed poison.","It was evident that she was acquainted with Catholic literature directed against socialism, and that in this circle her word had as much weight as his own.","Until latterly the attitude here towards women was far more vulgar and much coarser than in Russia, and the Italian women were themselves to blame for this; taking no interest in anything except the Church, they were for the most part strangers to the work of social advancement carried on by men and did not understand its meaning.","The man's self-love was wounded, the clever propagandist's fame suffered in the collisions with the girl; he got angry; lost his temper; occasionally he ridiculed her successfully, but she paid him back in his own coin, evoking his involuntary admiration, forcing him carefully to prepare the lectures he had to give to the circle she attended.","In addition to all this he noticed that every time he came to speak about the present shameful state of things, how man was being oppressed, his body and his soul mutilated--whenever he drew pictures of the life of the future when all will be both outwardly and inwardly free--he noticed that she was quite another being: she listened to his speeches, stifling the anger of a strong and clever woman who knows the weight of life's chains; listened to them with the rapt eagerness of a child that is told a fairy tale which is in harmony with its own magically complex soul.","This excited in him the anticipation of victory over a strong foe--a foe who could be a fine comrade, a valiant champion in the cause of a better future.","The rivalry between them lasted nearly a year, without calling forth any desire in them to join issue and fight their battle out; at length he made the first advance.","""Signorina is my constant opponent,"" he said, ""does she not think that in the interests of the cause it would be better if we were to become more closely acquainted?""","She willingly fell in with his suggestion, and almost from the first word they entered upon a spirited contest: the girl fiercely defended the Church as the only place where the souls of the weary find rest, where before the face of the Madonna all are equal and equally pitiable, notwithstanding the differences in worldly seeming.","He replied that it was not rest that people needed but struggle, that civic equality is impossible without equality in material things, and that behind the cloak of the Madonna is concealed a man to whom it is advantageous that people should remain miserable and unenlightened.","Thereafter these discussions filled their whole life, every meeting was a continuation of the one same endless, passionate theme, and every day the stubborn strength of their beliefs became more and more evident.","For him life was a struggle for the widening of knowledge, for the conquest of the forces of Nature, a struggle for the subjugation of mysterious energies to the will of man.","It was meet that everybody should be equally armed for this struggle, which was to issue in Freedom and the triumph of Reason--the most powerful of all forces, and the only force in the world which acts consciously.","For her life was a slow and painful sacrifice of man to the Unknown, the subjugation of Reason to that will the laws and aims of which are known to the priest only.","Nonplussed by this, he inquired: ""Why do you attend my lectures and what do you expect from socialism?""","""Yes, I know that I sin and contradict myself!""",she confessed sorrowfully.,"""But it is pleasant to listen to you and to dream about the possibility of happiness for all!""","Though not specially pretty she was slim and graceful, with an intelligent face, and large eyes, whose glance could be mild or angry, gentle or severe.","She worked in a silk factory, lived with her old mother, her one-legged father and a younger sister who was attending a technical school.","Sometimes she was happy, not boisterously, but quietly happy; she was fond of museums and old churches, grew enthusiastic over pictures and the beauty of which they were the token, and looking at them would say: ""How strange it is to think that these things have been hidden in private houses and that but one person had the right to enjoy them!","Everybody must see the beautiful, for only then does it live!""",She often spoke in so strange a manner that it seemed to him that her words came from some dark crevice in her soul; they reminded him of the groans of a wounded man.,He felt that this girl loved life and mankind with that deep mother love which is full of anxiety and compassion; he waited patiently till his faith should kindle her heart and this quiet love change to passion.,"The girl appeared to him to listen more attentively to his speeches and, in her heart, to be in agreement with him.","And he spoke more passionately of the need for an incessant, active struggle for the emancipation of man, of the nation, of humanity as a whole, from the old chains, the rust of which had eaten into their souls, and was blighting and poisoning them.","Once, while accompanying her home, he told her that he loved her, and that he wanted her to be his wife.","He was startled at the effect his words had on her: she reeled as though she had been struck, stared with wide-open eyes and turned pale; she leaned against the wall, and said, clasping her hands and looking, almost terrified, into his face: ""I was beginning to fear that that might be so; almost I felt it, because I loved you long ago.","But, O God!","what is going to happen now?""","""Days of your happiness and mine will begin, days of mutual work,"" he exclaimed.","""No,"" said the girl, her head drooping.","""No; we should not have talked about love.""","""Why?'","""Will you be married according to the laws of the Church?""",she asked quietly.,"""No!""","""Then, good-bye!""",And she walked quickly away from him.,"He overtook her, tried to persuade her; she heard him out in silence and then said: ""I, my mother and my father are all believers, and will die believers.",Marriage at the registrar's is no marriage for me; if children are born of such a marriage I know they will be unhappy.,"Love is consecrated only by marriage in a church, which alone can give happiness and peace.""","It seemed to him that soon she would yield; he, of course, could not give in.",They parted.,"As she bade him good-bye the girl said: ""Let us not torment each other, don't seek meetings with me.","Oh, if only you would go away from here!","I cannot, I am so poor.""","""I will make no promises,"" he replied.","The struggle between two strong natures began: they met, of course, and even more often than before; they met because they loved each other, sought meetings in the hope that one or other of them would be unable to stand the torments of an ungratified longing which was becoming more and more intense.","Their meetings were full of anguish and despair; after each one he felt quite worn out and exhausted; she, all in tears, went to confess to a priest.","He knew this and it seemed to him that the black wall of people in tonsures became stronger, higher and more insurmountable every day, that it grew and parted them till death.","Once, on a holiday, while walking with her through a field outside the town, he said, not threateningly, but more as if to himself: ""Do you know, it seems to me sometimes that I could kill you.""",She remained silent.,"""Did you hear what I said?""","Looking at him affectionately she answered: ""Yes.""",And he understood that she would rather die than give in to him.,"Before this ""yes"" he had embraced and kissed her sometimes; she struggled with him, but her resistance was becoming feebler, and he cherished the hope that some day she would yield, and that then her woman's instinct would help him to conquer.","But now he understood that that would not be victory, but enslavement, and from that day on he ceased to appeal to the woman in her.","So he wandered with her in the dark circle of her life's horizon, lit all the beacons before her that he could; but she listened to him with the dreamy smile of the blind, saw nothing, believed him not.","Once she said: ""I understand sometimes that all you say is possible, but I think that is because I love you!","I understand, but I do not believe, I cannot believe!","As soon as you go away all that is of you goes away too.""","This drama lasted nearly two years, and then the girl's health broke down: she became seriously ill.","He gave up his employment, ceased to attend to the work of his organisation, got into debt.","Avoiding his comrades, he spent his time wandering round her lodgings; or sat at her bedside, watching her wasting from disease and becoming more transparent every day, noting how the fire of fever glowed more and more brightly in her eyes.","""Speak to me of life, of the future,"" she asked him.","But he spoke of the present, enumerating vindictively everything that crushes us, all those things against which he was vowed to a lifelong struggle; he spoke of things that ought to be cast out of mens lives, as one discards soiled and worn-out rags.","She listened until the pain it gave her became unbearable; then touched his hand, and stopped him with an imploring look.","""I, am I dying?""","she asked him once, many days after the doctor had told him that she was in a galloping consumption and that her condition was hopeless.",He bowed his head but did not answer.,"""I know that I shall die soon,"" she said.","""Give me your hand.""","And, taking his outstretched hand, she pressed it to her burning lips and said: ""Forgive me, I have done you wrong.",It was all a mistake--and I have worn you out.,"Now when I am struck down I see that my faith was only fear before what I could not understand, notwithstanding my desire and my efforts.","It was fear, but it was in my blood, I was born with it.","I have my own mind--or yours--but somebody else's heart; you are right, I understand it now, but my heart could not agree with you.""",A few days later she died; he turned grey during her agony; he was only twenty-seven.,"Not long ago he married the only friend of that girl, his pupil.","It is they who go to the cemetery, to her--they go there every Sunday and place flowers on her grave.","He does not believe in his victory, he is convinced that when she said to him:  ""You are right,"" she lied to him in order to console him.",His wife thinks the same; they both lovingly revere her memory.,"This sad episode of a good woman who perished gives them strength by filling them with a desire to avenge her; it gives their mutual work a strangely fascinating character, and renders them untiring in their efforts.",* The river of gaily dressed people streams on in the sunshine; a merry noise accompanies its flow: children shout and laugh.,"Not everyone is gay and joyful; there are many hearts, no doubt, oppressed by dark sorrow, many minds tormented by contradictions; but we all go steadily forward.","And ""Freedom, Freedom is our goal!""",And the more vigour we put into it the faster we shall advance!,THE TRAITOR'S MOTHER Many are the tales that may be told about mothers.,For several weeks now the town had been surrounded by a close ring of armed foes.,Of nights bonfires were lit and a multitude of fiery red eyes looked out from the darkness upon the walls.,"They glowed ominously, these fires, as if warning the inhabitants of the town.",And the thoughts they conjured up were of a gloomy kind.,From the walls it was apparent that the noose of foes was being drawn tighter and tighter.,Black shadows could be seen moving this way and that about the fires.,"The neighing of well-fed horses could be heard, and the clatter of arms and the loud laughter and merry songs of men confident of victory--and what is more painful to listen to than the laughter and songs of the foe?","The enemy had filled with corpses the streams which supplied the town with water; they had burned down the vineyards around the town, trampled down the fields, and cut down the trees of the neighbourhood, leaving the town exposed on all sides; and almost every day missiles of iron and lead were poured into it by the guns and rifles of the foe.","Detachments of half-starved soldiers, tired out by skirmishes, passed along the narrow streets of the town; from the windows of the houses come the groans of wounded, the raving of men in delirium, the prayers of women and the crying of children.","Everybody spoke quietly, in subdued tones, interrupting one another's speech in the middle of a word to listen intently to detect whether the foe was not commencing to storm the town.","Life became especially unbearable in the evening, when the groans and cries became louder and more noticeable in the stillness, when blue-black shadows crept from the far-off mountain gorges, hiding the enemy's camp and moving towards the half-shattered walls, and, over the black summits of the mountains, the moon appeared, like a lost shield battered by the blows of heavy swords.","Expecting no assistance from without, spent with toil and hunger, and losing hope more and more every day, the people looked fearfully at the moon, at the sharp crests and the black gorges of the mountains, at the noisy camp of the enemy--everything spoke to them of death and no single star twinkled solace to them.","They were afraid to light lamps in the houses; a thick fog enveloped the streets, and in this fog, like a fish at the bottom of a river, a woman flitted silently to and fro, wrapped from head to foot in a black mantle.","People, noticing her, asked one another: ""Is it she?""","""Yes!""","And they drew back into the recesses of the doorways or, lowering their heads, ran past her silently.","The men in charge of the patrols warned her sternly: ""You are in the street again, Monna Marianna?",Have a care!,"They may kill you and no one will trouble to search for the culprit.""","She stood erect and waited, but the patrol passed her by, either hesitating or not wishing to harm her.",Armed men walked round her as if she had been a corpse.,"Yet she lingered on in the darkness, moving slowly from street to street, solitary, silent and black, seeming the personification of the town's misfortunes.","And around her, mournfully pursuing her, surged depressing sounds: groans, sobs, prayers, and the grim talk of soldiers who had lost all hope of victory.","She was a citizen and a mother, and her thoughts were of her son and of the town of her birth.","And her son, a handsome but gay and heartless youth, was at the head of the men who were destroying the town.","Not long ago she had looked at him with pride, as upon her precious gift to the fatherland, as upon a beneficent force created by her for the welfare of the town, her birthplace, and the place also where she had borne and brought up her son.","Hundreds of indissoluble ties bound her heart to the ancient stones, out of which her ancestors had built the houses and the city walls; to the soil in which lay the bones of her kindred; to the legends, songs and hopes of her native people.",And this heart now had lost him whom it had loved most and it was rent in twain; it was like a balance in which her love for her son was being weighed against her love for the town.,And it was not possible yet to decide which love outweighed the other.,"In this state of mind she walked the streets at night, and many, not recognising her, were frightened, thinking that the dark figure was the personification of Death which was so near to them all; those that recognised her stepped hurriedly out of her way to avoid the traitor's mother.","Once, in a deserted corner of the city wall, she came across another woman: she was kneeling by the side of a corpse, and praying with face uplifted to the stars; on the wall, above her head, sentinels were talking quietly; their guns clattered as they knocked against the projecting stones of the wall.","The traitor's mother inquired: ""Your husband?""","""No.""","""Brother?""","""Son.","My husband was killed thirteen days ago; this one to-day.""","And, rising, the mother of the dead man said humbly: ""The Madonna sees everything, she knows everything, and I thank her!""","""What for?""","asked Marianna, and the other replied: ""Now that he has fallen with honour, fighting for his fatherland, I can say that he sometimes caused me anxiety: he was reckless, fond of pleasure, and I feared lest for that reason he might betray the town, as Marianna's son has done, the enemy of God and men, the leader of our foes; accursed be he and accursed be the womb that bore him!""",Covering her face Marianna hurried away.,"The next day she went to the defenders of the town and said: ""Either kill me because my son has become your enemy, or open the gate for me, that I may go to him.""","They replied: ""You are a citizen, and the town should be dear to you; your son is just as much your enemy as he is ours.""","""I am his mother: I love him and deem it to be my fault that he is what he is.""","Then they consulted together as to what should be done and came to this decision: ""We cannot, in honour, kill you for your son's sin; we know you could not have suggested this terrible sin to him; and we can guess how you must be suffering.","You are not wanted by the town, even as a hostage; your son does not trouble himself about you; we think he has forgotten you, the fiend--and therein lies your punishment, if you think you have deserved it!","To us it seems more terrible than death!""","""Yes,"" she said; ""it is more terrible.""","They opened the gate for her, and let her out of the town.","For a long time they watched her from the wall as she made her way over this native soil, sodden now with blood shed by her son.","She walked slowly, dragging her feet painfully through the mire, bowing her head before the corpses of the defenders of the town and repugnantly spurning the pieces of broken weapons that lay in her path--for mothers hate the instruments of destruction, believing only in that which preserves life.","She walked carefully, as though she carried under her cloak a bowl full of some liquid which she was afraid of spilling.","And as she went on, as her figure grew smaller and smaller, it seemed to those who watched her from the wall that their former depression and hopelessness were disappearing with her.","They saw her stop when she had covered half the distance, and, throwing back her hood, gaze long at the town.","Beyond, in the enemy's camp, they had also noticed her advancing alone through the deserted fields; figures, as black as herself, cautiously approached her.","They went up to her, asked her who she was and whither she was going.","""Your leader is my son,"" she said, and none of the soldiers doubted her words.","They walked by her side, speaking in terms of praise of the bravery and cleverness of their leader.","She listened to them, her head raised proudly in the air and showing not the least surprise.",That was just how her son should be!,And now she stands before the man whom she knew nine months before his birth; before him whom she had never put out of her heart.,"And he stands before her, in silk and velvet, and wearing a sword ornamented with precious stones.","In everything fit and seemly, exactly as she had seen him many a time in her dreams--rich, famous and beloved!","""Mother!""","he said, kissing her hands.","""You come to me; it means that you have understood me, and to-morrow I will capture this accursed town!""","""In which you were born,"" she reminded him.","Intoxicated by his exploits, maddened by the desire for still greater glory, he spoke to her with the insolent pride of youth.","""I was born into the world and for the world, in order to strike it with astonishment!",I spared this town for your sake--it is like a splinter in my foot and hinders me from advancing to fame as quickly as I could wish.,"But either to-day or tomorrow I will destroy the nest of these stubborn ones!""","""Where every stone knows you and remembers you as a child,"" she said.","""Stones are dumb; if men cannot make them speak let mountains speak of me--that is what I want!""","""But the people?""",she asked.,"""O yes, I remember them, mother.","I need them also, for only in the memories of people are heroes immortal.""","She replied: ""He is a hero who creates life, spiting death, who conquers death.""","""No,"" he replied.","""He who destroys becomes as famous as he who builds cities.","For instance, we do not know whether Æneas or Romulus built Rome, but we know the name of Alaric and the other heroes who destroyed it.""","""It has outlived all names,"" the mother suggested.",In this strain he spoke to her till sunset.,She interrupted his vain talk less frequently and her proud head gradually drooped.,"A mother creates, she preserves, and to talk about destruction in her presence is to speak against her understanding of life.",But not knowing this the son was denying all that life meant for his mother.,"A mother is always against death, and the hand that introduces death into people's dwellings is hateful and hostile to all mothers.","But the son did not see it, blinded by the cold gleam of glory which kills the heart.","And he did not know that a mother can be just as resourceful, just as pitiless and fearless as an animal, when it concerns life which the mother herself creates and preserves.","She sat limply, with head bowed down.","Through the open mouth of the rich tent of the leader could be seen the town where she had thrilled to the conception and travailed in the birth of this her firstborn child, whose only wish now was to destroy.","The purple rays of the sun bathed in blood the walls and towers of the town, the window-panes glistened ominously; the whole town seemed to be wounded, and from its hundreds of wounds streamed the red blood of life.","Time went on, and the town grew black, like a corpse, and the stars like funeral candles were lit above it.","She saw with her mind's eye the dark houses where they were afraid to light the lamps, for fear of attracting the attention of the enemy; and the dark streets filled with the odour of corpses and the subdued whispers of people awaiting death--she saw everything and all; everything that was native and familiar to her stood out before her, awaiting her decision in silence, and she felt that she was the mother of all the people of her native town.","From the dark mountain-tops clouds descended into the valley, and like winged coursers sped upon the doomed town.","""Perhaps we shall make an attack to-night,"" said her son, ""if the night is dark enough!","It is not easy to kill when the sun looks into one's eyes and the glitter of the weapons blinds one--many blows are wasted then,"" said he, examining his sword.","""Come here,"" said his mother; ""put your head on my breast; rest a while, and recall to your mind how happy and kind you were as a child, and how everybody loved you.""","He obeyed, knelt against her and said, closing his eyes: ""I love only glory and you, because you bore me as I am.""","""But women?""","she asked, bending over him.","""There are many of them, one soon tires of them, as of everything sweet.""","And finally she asked him: ""Do you not wish to have children?""","""Why?",In order that they may be killed?,"Somebody like me would kill them; it would grieve me, and no doubt I should be too old then, and too weak, to avenge them.""","""You are handsome, but as sterile as the lightning,"" she said, sighing.","He answered, smiling: ""Yes, as the lightning.""",And he fell asleep on her breast like a child.,Then she covered him with her black cloak and plunged a knife into his heart.,"He shuddered, and died instantaneously, for she, his mother, knew well where her son's heart beat.","And having pushed the corpse off her knees to the feet of the astonished guards, she said, pointing in the direction of the town: ""As a citizen I have done all I could for my fatherland: as a mother I remain with my son!","It is too late for me to give birth to another, my life is of no use to anyone.""","And the same knife, still warm with his blood--her blood--she plunged into her own bosom, and doubtless struck the heart.",When one's heart aches it is easy to strike it without missing.,"THE FREAK It is a quiet sultry day, and life seems to have come to a standstill in the serene calm; the sky looks affably down at the earth, with a limpid eye of which the sun is the fiery iris.","The sea has been hammered smooth out of some blue metal, the coloured boats of the fishermen are as motionless as if they were soldered into the semicircle of the bay, which is as clear as the sky overhead.","A seagull flies past, lazily flapping its wings; out of the water comes another bird, whiter yet and more beautiful than the one in the air.","In the distant mist floats, as if melting in the sun, a violet isle, a solitary rock in the sea, like a precious stone in the ring formed by the Neapolitan bay.","The rocky isle, with its rugged promontories sloping down to the sea, is covered with gorgeous clusters of the dark foliage of the vine, of orange, lemon and fig trees, and the dull silver of the tiny olive leaves.","Out of this mass of green, which falls abruptly to the sea, red, white and golden flowers smile pleasantly, while the yellow and orange-coloured fruits remind one of the stars on a hot moonlight night, when the sky is dark and the air moist.","There is quiet in the sky, on the sea and in one's soul; one stops and listens to all the living things singing a wordless prayer to their God--the Sun.","Between the gardens winds a narrow path, and along it a tall woman in black descends slowly to the sea, stepping from stone to stone.",Her dress has faded in the sun: brown spots and even patches can be seen on it from afar.,"Her head is bare; her grey hair glistens like silver, framing in crisp curls her high forehead, her temples and the tawny skin of her cheeks; it is of the kind that no combing could render smooth.","Her face is sharp, severe, once seen to be remembered for ever; there is something profoundly ancient in its withered aspect; and when one encounters the direct look of her dark eyes one involuntarily thinks of the burning wilderness of the East, of Deborah and Judith.",Her head is bent over some red garment which she is knitting; the steel of her hook glistens.,"A ball of wool is hidden somewhere in her dress, but the red thread appears to come from her bosom.","The path is steep and treacherous, the pebbles fall and rattle as she steps, but this greyhaired woman descends as confidently as if her feet themselves could find the way.","This tale is told of her in the village: She is a widow; her husband, a fisherman, soon after their wedding went out fishing and never returned, leaving her with a child under her heart.","When the child was born she hid it; she did not take her son out into the street and sunshine to show him off, as mothers are wont to do, but kept him in a dark corner of her hut, swaddling him in rags.","Not one of the neighbours knew how the new-born baby was shaped--they saw only the large head and big, motionless eyes in a yellow face.","Previously she had been healthy, alert and cheerful and able not only to struggle persistently with necessity herself but knowing also how to say a word of encouragement to others.","But now it was noticed that she had become silent, that she was always musing, and knitting her brows, and looked at everything as through a mist of sorrow, with a strange, wistful, searching expression.","Little time was needed for everyone to learn about her misfortune: the child born to her was a freak, that is why she hid it, that is what depressed her.","The neighbours told her, of course, how shameful it is for a woman to be the mother of a freak; no one except the Madonna knows whether this cruel insult is a punishment justly deserved or not; but that the child was guiltless, and she was wrong to deprive it of sunshine.",She listened to them and showed them her son.,"His arms and legs were short, like the fins of a fish, his head, which was puffed out like a huge ball, was weakly supported by a thin, skinny neck, and his face was wrinkled like that of an old man; he had a pair of dull eyes and a large mouth drawn into a set smile.","The women cried when they beheld him, men frowned, expressed loathing and went gloomily away; the freak's mother sat on the ground, now bowing her head, now raising it and looking at the others, as if silently inquiring about something which no one could grasp.","The neighbours made a box like a coffin for the freak, and filled it with rags and combings of wool; they put the little child into this soft warm nest and placed the box out in the yard in the shade, entertaining a secret hope that the sunlight which performs miracles every day might work yet one miracle more.","Time passed, but he remained unchanged, with a large head, a thin body, and four helpless limbs; only his smile assumed a more definite expression of ravenous greed, and his mouth was becoming filled with two rows of sharp, crooked teeth.","The short paws learnt to catch chunks of bread and to carry them, with rarely a mistake, to the large warm mouth.","He was dumb, but when food was being consumed near him and he could smell it he made a mumbling sound, working his jaws and shaking his large head, and the dull whites of his eyes became covered with a red network of bloody veins.","The freak's appetite was enormous, and waxed greater as time went on; his mumbling never ceased.","The mother worked untiringly, but very often her earnings were small and sometimes she earned nothing at all.","She did not complain, and accepted help from the neighbours rather unwillingly, and always without a word.","When she was away from home the neighbours, irritated by the mumbling of the child, ran into the yard and shoved crusts of bread, vegetables, fruit, anything that could be eaten, into the ever-hungry jaws.","""Soon he will devour everything you have,"" they said to her.","""Why don't you send him to some orphanage or hospital?""","She answered gloomily: ""Leave him alone!","I am his mother, I gave him life and I must feed him.""","She was fair to look upon, and more than one man sought her love, but unsuccessfully.","To one whom she liked more than the rest she said: ""I cannot be your wife; I am afraid of giving birth to another freak; you would be ashamed.","No, go away!""","The man tried to persuade her, reminded her of the Madonna, who is just to mothers and looks upon them as her sisters, but the freak's mother replied to him: ""I don't know what I am guilty of, but I have been cruelly punished.""","He implored, wept, raged; and finally she said: ""One cannot do what one does not believe to be right.","Go away!""",He went away to a far-off place and she never saw him again.,"And so for many years she filled the insatiable jaws, which chewed incessantly.","He devoured the fruits of her toil, her blood, her life; his head grew and became more terrible, until it seemed ready to break away from the thin weak neck and to rise in the air like a balloon; one could imagine it in its course knocking against the corners of houses, and swaying lazily from side to side.","All who looked into the yard stopped involuntarily and shuddered, unable to understand what they saw.","Near the vine-covered wall, propped up on stones, as on an altar, was a box, out of which rose a head, showing up clearly against the background of foliage.","The yellow, freckled, wrinkled face, with its high cheekbones, and vacant eyes starting out of their sockets, impressed itself on the memory of all who saw it; the broad flat nostrils quivered, the abnormally developed cheek-bones and jaws worked monotonously, the fleshy lips hung loose, disclosing two rows of ravenous teeth; the large projecting ears, like those of an animal, seemed to lead a separate existence.","And this awful visage was crowned by a mass of black hair growing in small, close curls, like the wool of a negro.","Holding in his little hands, which were short and small like the paws of a lizard, a chunk of something to eat, the freak would bend his head forward like a bird pecking, and, wrenching off bits of food with his teeth, would munch noisily and snuffle.","When he was satisfied he grinned; his eyes shifted towards the bridge of his nose, forming one dull, expressionless spot on the half-dead face, the movements of which recalled to mind the twitchings of a person in agony.","When he was hungry he would crane his neck forward, open his red maw and mumble clamorously, moving a thin, snake-like tongue.","Crossing themselves and muttering a prayer people stepped aside, reminded of everything evil that they had lived through, of all the misfortunes they had experienced in their lives.","The blacksmith, an old man of a gloomy disposition, said more than once: ""When I see the all-devouring mouth of this creature I feel that somebody like him has devoured my strength; it seems to me that we all live and die for the sake of such parasites.""",This dumb head called forth in everyone sombre thoughts and feelings that oppressed the heart.,"The freak's mother listened to what people said, and was silent; but her hair turned quickly grey, wrinkles appeared on her face and she had long since forgotten how to laugh.","It was known that sometimes she would spend the whole night standing in the doorway, and looking up at the sky as if waiting for something.","Shrugging their shoulders they said to one another: ""Whatever is she waiting for?""","""Put him on the square near the old church,"" her neighbours advised her.","""Foreigners pass there; they will be sure to throw him a few coppers.""","The mother shuddered as if in horror, saying: ""It would be terrible if he were seen by strangers, by people from other countries--what would they think of us?""","They replied: ""There is misfortune everywhere, and they all know it.""",Disparagingly she shook her head.,"But foreigners, driven by the desire for change, wander everywhere, and naturally enough as they passed her house looked in.","She was at home, she saw the ugly looks, expressing aversion and loathing, on the repleted faces of these idle people, heard how they spoke about her son, making wry mouths and screwing up their eyes.","Her heart was especially wounded by a few words uttered contemptuously, with animosity, and obvious triumph.","Many times she repeated to herself the stranger's words, committing them to memory; her heart, the heart of an Italian woman and a mother, divined their insulting meaning.",That same day she went to an interpreter whom she knew and asked what the words meant.,"""It depends upon who uttered them!""","he replied, knitting his brows.","""They mean: 'Italy is the first of the Latin races to degenerate.'","... Where did you hear this lie?""",She went away without answering.,The next day her son died in convulsions from over-eating.,"She sat in the yard near the box, her hand on the head of her dead son; still seeming to be calmly waiting, waiting.",She looked questioningly into the eyes of everybody who came to the house to look upon the deceased.,"All were silent, no one spoke to her, though perhaps many wished to congratulate her--she had been freed from slavery--to say a word of consolation to her--she had lost a son--but everyone was mute.",Sometimes people understand that there is a time for silence.,"For some time after this she continued to gaze long into people's faces, as if questioning them about something; then she became as ordinary as everybody else.","THE MIGHT OF MOTHERHOOD Let us praise Woman-Mother, the inexhaustible source of all-conquering life!","Here we shall tell of the Iron Timur-Lenk, the Lame Lynx--of Sahib-Kiran, the lucky conqueror--of Tamerlane, as the Infidels have named him--of the man who sought to destroy the whole world.","For fifty years he scoured the earth, his iron heel crushing towns and states as an elephant's foot crushes ant-hills.",Red rivers of blood flowed in his tracks wherever he went.,"He built high towers of the bones of conquered peoples; he destroyed Life, vying with the might of Death, on whom he took revenge for having robbed him of his son Jihangir.","He was a terrible man, for he wanted to deprive Death of all his victims; to leave Death to die of hunger and ennui!","From the day on which his son Jihangir died and the people of Samarcand, clothed in black and light blue, their heads covered with dust and ashes, met the conqueror of the cruel Getes, from that day until the hour when Death met him in Otrar, and overcame him--for thirty years Timur did not smile.","He lived with lips compressed, bowing his head to no one, and his heart was closed to compassion for thirty years.","Let us praise Woman-Mother, the only power to which Death humbly submits.","Here we shall tell the true tale of a mother, how Iron Tamerlane, the servant and slave of Death, and the bloody scourge of the earth, bowed down before her.",This is how it came to pass.,"Timur-Bek was feasting in the beautiful valley of Canigula which is covered with clouds of roses and jasmine, in the valley called ""Love of Flowers"" by the poets of Samarcand, from which one can see the light blue minarets of the great town, and the blue cupolas of the mosques.","Fifteen hundred round tents were spread out fan-wise in the valley, looking like so many tulips.","Above them hundreds of silk flags were gently swaying, like living flowers.","In their midst, like a queen among her subjects, was the tent of Gurgan-Timur.","The tent had four sides, each measuring one hundred paces, three spears' length in height; its roof rested on twelve golden columns as thick as the body of a man.","The tent was made of silk, striped in black, yellow and light blue; five hundred red cords fastened it to the ground.","There was a silver eagle at each of the four corners, and under the blue cupola, on a dais in the middle of the tent, was seated a fifth eagle--the all-conquering Timur-Gurgan himself, the King of Kings.",He wore a loose robe of light blue silk covered with no fewer than five thousand large pearls.,"On his grey head, which was terrible to look upon, was a white cap with a ruby on the sharp point.",The ruby swayed backwards and forwards; it glistened like a fiery eye surveying the world.,The face of the Lame One was like a broad knife covered with rust from the blood into which it had been plunged thousands of times.,"His eyes were narrow and small but they saw everything; their gleam resembled the cold gleam of ""Tsaramut,"" the favourite stone of the Arabs, which the infidels call emerald, and by means of which epilepsy can be cured.",The king wore earrings of rubies from Ceylon which resembled in colour a pretty girl's lips.,"On the ground, on carpets that could not be matched, were three hundred golden pitchers of wine and everything needed for the royal banquet.",Behind Timur stood the musicians; at his feet were his kindred: kings and princes and the commanders of his troops; by his side was no one.,"Nearest of all to him was the tipsy poet Kermani, he who once to the question of the destroyer of the world, ""Kermani, how much would you give for me if I were to be sold?""","replied to the sower of death and terror: ""Twenty-five askers.""","""But that is the value of my belt alone!""","exclaimed Timur, surprised.","""I was only thinking of the belt,"" replied Kermani, ""only of the belt; because you yourself are not worth a farthing!""","Thus spake the poet Kermani to the King of Kings, to the man of evil and terror.","Let us therefore value the fame of the poet, the friend of truth, always higher than the fame of Timur.","Let us praise poets who have only one God--the beautifully spoken, fearless word of truth--that which is their god for ever!","It was an hour of mirth, carousal and proud reminiscences of battles and victories.","Amid the sounds of music and popular games, warriors were fencing before the tent of the king, and endeavouring to show their prowess in killing.","A number of motley-coloured clowns were tumbling about, strong men were wrestling, acrobats were performing as though they had no bones in their bodies.","A performance of elephants was also in progress; they were painted red and green, which made some of them look ludicrous, others terrible.","At this hour of joy, when Timur's men were intoxicated with fear before him, with pride in his fame, with the fatigue of battles, with wine and koumiss--at this mad hour, suddenly through the noise, like lightning through a cloud, the cry of a woman reached the ears of the conqueror of the Sultan Bayazet, the cry of a proud eagle, a sound familiar and attuned to his afflicted soul--afflicted by Death, and therefore so cruel to mankind and to life.",He gave orders to inquire who had cried out in this voice devoid of joy.,"He was told that a woman had come, all in rags and covered with dust; she seemed crazy, and speaking Arabic demanded--she demanded--to see the master of three parts of the world.","""Lead her in!""",said the king.,"Before him stood a woman, barefooted, in rags faded by the sun.","Her black hair hung loose, covering her naked breast, and her face was of the colour of bronze.","Her eyes expressed command and her tawny hand did not shake as she pointed it at the ""Lame One.""","""Are you he that defeated Sultan Bayazet?""",she asked.,"""Yes, I am he.",I have conquered many and am not yet tired of victories.,"What have you to tell me about yourself, woman?""","""Listen,"" she said.","""Whatever you may have done, you are only a man, but I am a mother.",You serve Death--I serve Life.,You are guilty before me and I am come to demand that you atone for your guilt.,They tell me that your watchword is 'Justice is Power.',"I do not believe it, but you must be just to me because I am a mother.""",The king was wise enough to overlook the insult and felt the force of the words behind it.,"He said: ""Sit down and speak.","I will listen to you.""","She settled herself comfortably on a carpet in the narrow circle of kings and related as follows:-- ""I have come from near Salerno.",It is in far-off Italy--you would not know it.,"My father was a fisherman, my husband also;

but she took his money first.""","""What baseness,"" said the old man.","""He is a man with a dirty imagination, that's all.","I know some Russians who were with me at the University; they are fine fellows.""","""But listen to me.","The strange thing was ..."" ""I have heard it said ..."" The fat Russian, wiping his perspiring face with a handkerchief, said to the ladies in an idle, indifferent tone: ""He is telling a Jewish anecdote.""","""With such animation?""","smiled the young lady; and the other remarked: ""In these people, with their gestures and their noise, there is a lack of variety.""","A town grows on the coast, houses rise from beyond the hills and huddle close together, until they form a solid wall of buildings which reflect the sunlight and look as if they were carved out of ivory.","""It is like Yalta,"" remarked the young lady, rising up.","""I will go to Lisa.""","She ambled her portly body, which was clothed in some bluish material, slowly along the deck.","As she passed the group of Italians the grey-haired man interrupted his speech and said quietly: ""What fine eyes!""","""Yes,"" nodded the old man in spectacles.","""Basilida, I imagine, must have looked like that.""","""Basilida, the Byzantine?""","""I picture her as a Slav woman.""","""They are saying something about Lydia,"" said the fat man.","""What?""",asked the lady.,"""No doubt some low jokes?""","""About her eyes.","They admire----"" The lady made a grimace.","The brasswork on the steamer glistened as, gently and rapidly, she neared the shore.","The black walls of the pier came in sight and, beyond them, rising into the sky, a forest of masts.",Here and there bright coloured flags hung motionless; dark smoke ascended and seemed to melt in the air; there was a smell of oil and coal dust; the noise of work proceeding in the harbour and the complex bourdon note of a large town reached the ear.,The fat man suddenly burst out laughing.,"""What's the matter?""","asked the lady, half-closing her grey, faded eyes.","""The Germans will smash them up, by Jove!","You will see it!""","""Why should you rejoice at that?""","""Just so.""","The man with the side-whiskers, examining the soles of his boots, asked the red-haired man, speaking deliberately and in a loud voice: ""Were you satisfied with this surprise or not?""","The red-haired man twisted his moustache fiercely, and made no reply.",The steamer slowed down.,"The green water splashed against the white sides of the ship, as if in protest.","It gave no reflection of the marble houses, the high towers and the azure terraces.","The black jaws of the harbour opened, disclosing a thick scattering of ships.","RUSSIAN TALES THE PROFESSOR The young man was ugly, and knew it.","But he said to himself: ""I am clever, am I not?",I will become a sage.,"It is an easy matter here in Russia.""","He began to read bulky works, for he was by no means stupid: he understood that the presence of wisdom can most easily be proved by quotations from books.","Having read as many wise books as were necessary to make him short-sighted, he proudly held up his nose, which had become red from the weight of the spectacles, and declared to the world at large: ""Well, you won't deceive me.","I see that life is a trap, put here for me by nature.""","""And love?""",asked the Spirit of Life.,"""No, I thank you.","Praise be to God, I am not a poet.","I will not enter the iron cage of inevitable duties for the sake of a piece of cheese.""","But he was only moderately talented, and so he decided to take up the duties of a professor of philosophy.","He went to the Minister of Popular Education and said to him: ""Your Excellency, I can preach that life is meaningless, and that one should not submit to the dictates of nature.""","The Minister considered a while whether that would do, then asked: ""Should the orders of the authorities be obeyed?""","""Most decidedly,"" said the philosopher, reverently inclining his head, which the study of so many books had rendered bald.","""Since human passions----"" ""Very well, you may have the chair.",Your salary will be sixteen roubles a month.,"But should I require you to take into consideration the laws of nature, take care, have no opinions of your own.","I shall not put up with that.""","After thinking for some moments the Minister added, in a melancholy voice: ""We live at a time when, for the sake of the unity of the state, it will perhaps be necessary to recognise that the laws of nature not only exist, but that they may to a certain extent prove useful.""","""Just think of it!""",exclaimed the philosopher to himself.,"""Even I may live to see it.""",But aloud he said nothing.,"So he settled down to his work: every week he ascended the rostrum and spoke for an hour to curly-headed youths in this strain: ""Gentlemen, man is limited from without, he is limited from within.",Nature is antagonistic to him.,Woman is a blind tool of Nature.,"All our life, therefore, is meaningless.""","He had grown accustomed to think like this himself, and often in his enthusiasm he spoke eloquently and well.",The young students were enthusiastic in their applause.,"He, pleased with himself, nodded his bald head and smiled at them kindly.","His little nose shone, and everything went on smoothly.",Dining at a restaurant disagreed with him--like all pessimists he suffered from indigestion--so he got married and ate his dinners at home for twenty-nine years.,In between his work--he had not noticed how--he brought up four children.,Then he died.,"Behind his coffin solemnly walked his three grief-stricken daughters with their young husbands, and his son, a poet, who was in love with all the beautiful women in the world.","The students sang: ""Eternal Memory.""","They sang loudly and with animation, but badly.","Over his grave his colleagues, the professors, made flowery speeches, referring to the well-ordered metaphysics of the departed; everything was done in correct style; it was solemn, and at times even touching.","""Well, the old man is dead,"" said a student to his comrades as they were leaving the cemetery.","""He was a pessimist,"" chimed in another.","A third one asked: ""Is that so?""","""Yes, a pessimist and a conservative.""","""What, the bald-headed one was?","I had not noticed it.""","The fourth student was a poor man, and he inquired expectantly: ""Shall we be invited to the obituary feast?""","Yes, they had been invited.","During his lifetime the deceased had written a number of excellent books, in which he proved, in glowing and beautiful language, the vanity of life.","Needless to say, the books were bought and read with pleasure.","Whatever may be said to the contrary, man likes what is beautiful.",His family was well provided for--even pessimism can achieve that.,The obituary feast was arranged on a large scale.,"The poor student had a good meal, such as he seldom had, and as he went home he thought, smiling good-humouredly: ""Well, even pessimism is useful at times.""",THE POET There was another case.,"A man, thinking himself a poet, wrote verse.","But for some reason it was poor verse, and the circumstance disconcerted him.","Walking in the street one day, he saw a whip lying in the road, lost by a cabman.","An inspiration came to the poet, and the following image at once formed itself in his mind:--     ""In the road, in the dust, the snake lies,     Like a whip in the dust of the road.","In a swarm, like a cloud, come the flies,     And the ants and their kind in a swarm.","Thro' the skin, like the links of a chain,     Show the ribs--they show white thro' the skin.","O dead snake, thou remind'st me again     Of my love, my dead love, O dead snake.""","Suddenly the whip stood up on end and, swaying, said to him: ""Why are you telling lies?","You are a married man, you know how to read and write, yet you are telling lies.",Your love has not died.,"You love your wife and you are afraid of her.""",The poet became angry.,"""That is no business of yours.""","""And the verses are poor.""","""They are better than you could make.","You can only crack, and even that you cannot do by yourself.""","""But, anyhow, why do you tell lies?","Your love did not die.""","""All kinds of things happen--it was necessary it should.""","""Oh, your wife will whip you.","Take me to her.""","""Oh, you may wait.""","""Well, well, go your own way,"" said the whip, curling itself up like a corkscrew; it lay down in the road and began to think of other people.","The poet went to an inn, ordered a bottle of beer, and began to think about himself.","""Although the whip was decidedly rude, the verse is poor again, that's true enough.",How strange it is!,"One person always writes bad verse, while another sometimes succeeds in writing verse that is good.",How badly everything is arranged in this world!,"What a stupid world it is!""","So he sat and drank, trying to arrive at a clearer conception of the world.",He came to the conclusion at last that it was necessary to speak the truth.,"This world is good for nothing, and it really disgusts a man to live in it.","He thought about an hour and a half in this strain, and then he wrote:     ""For all their pleasant seeming, our desires     A dread scourge are that drives us to our doom;     Blindly we blunder thro' the maze where waits us     Death, the fell serpent, in the murky gloom.",Oh!,let us strangle our insensate longings!,"They do but lure us from the appointed way;     Lead us thro' thorns to our most bitter ruing,     Leave us heartbroken in the twilight grey.","And in the end full surely Death awaits us,     Lives there the man but knows that he must die?""",He wrote more in the same spirit--twenty-eight lines in all.,"""That's good!""",exclaimed the poet; and went home quite satisfied with himself.,At home he read the lines to his wife.,She liked them.,"She merely said: ""There is something wrong with the first four lines.""","""They will swallow it all right.",Pushkin too began rather badly.,But what do you think of the metre?,"It is that of a requiem.""","Then he began to play with his little son: he put him on his knee and, tossing him up, sang in a poor tenor:     ""Tramp, tramp,     On somebody's bridge!","When I grow rich     I will pave my own bridge,     And nobody else     Shall walk over my bridge.""","They spent the evening merrily, and the next morning the poet took his verses to an editor, who spoke in a profound manner (these editors are all profound--that is why their magazines are so dry)?","""H'm!""","said the editor, rubbing his nose.","""You know, this is not altogether bad, and, what is more important, it is quite in the spirit of the times.",Very much so.,You seem to have discovered yourself.,You must continue in the same strain.,Sixteen copecks a line ... four ... forty-eight.,"I congratulate you.""","The verses were printed, and the poet felt as if he had had another birthday.","His wife kissed him fervently, and said dreamily: ""Oh, my poet!""",They had a great time.,"But a youth, a very good youth, who was earnestly seeking the meaning of life, read these verses and shot himself dead.","He was quite convinced, you see, that, before denouncing life, the poet had sought the meaning as long as he himself had done, and that the search had been attended by sorrow, as in his own case.",The youth did not know that these sombre thoughts were sold at the rate of sixteen copecks a line.,He was an earnest youth.,"Let not the reader think I mean that even a whip can, at times, be used on people to their advantage.",THE WRITER There once lived a very ambitious writer.,"When he was abused, it seemed to him that he was abused too much, and unjustly.","When he was praised he thought that they neither praised him enough, nor wisely.","He lived in a state of perpetual discontent, until the time came for him to die.","The writer lay down on his bed and began grumbling: ""That's just how it is.",What do you think of it?,Two novels are not yet finished--and altogether I have enough material for ten years.,"The devil take this law of nature, and every other law.",What nonsense!,The novels might have turned out well.,"Why have they invented this idiotic compulsory service, as if things could not have been arranged differently?","And it always comes at the wrong time: the novels are not finished yet.""","He was angry, but disease was eating into his bones and whispering into his ears: ""You trembled, eh?",Why did you tremble?,"You don't sleep at night, eh?",Why don't you sleep?,"You have drunk of sorrow, eh?--and of joy too?""","He kept knitting his brows, but realised at last that nothing could be done.","With a wave of the arm he dismissed the thought of his novels, and died.","It was very disagreeable, but he died.",So far so good.,"They washed him, dressed him according to custom, combed his hair and placed him on the table, straight and stiff like a soldier, heels together, toes apart.","He lay very still, his nose drooped, and the only feeling he had was surprise.","""How strange it is that I feel nothing at all!",It's the first time in my life.,"Ah, my wife is crying.","Well, now you cry, but before, when anything went wrong, you flew into a rage.",My little son is crying too.,"No doubt he will grow up a good-for-nothing fellow--the sons of writers, I have noticed, always do.",No doubt that also is in accordance with some law of nature.,"What an infernal number of such laws there are.""","So he lay and thought and thought, and wondered at his composure.",He was not accustomed to it.,"They started for the cemetery, but as he was being borne along he suddenly felt there were not enough mourners.","""No matter,"" said he to himself, ""though I may not be a very great writer, literature must be respected.""","He looked out of the coffin and saw that, as a matter of fact, without counting his relations, only nine people accompanied him, among whom were two beggars and a lamplighter with a ladder over his shoulder.",At this discovery he became quite indignant.,"""What swine!""","The slight so incensed him that he immediately became resurrected, and, being a small man, jumped unperceived out of his coffin.","He ran into a barber's, had his moustache and beard shaved off, and borrowed a black coat with a patch under the armpit, leaving his own coat in its stead.","Then he made his face look solemn and aggrieved, and became like a living man.",It was impossible to recognise him.,"With the curiosity natural to his profession he asked the barber: ""Are you not astonished at this strange incident?""","The latter stroked his moustache condescendingly and replied: ""Well, we live in Russia, and we are used to all kinds of things.""","""But then I am a deceased person and suddenly I change my attire?""","""It is the fashion of the times.",And in what way are you a deceased person?,Only externally!,As far as the general run of people goes it would be better if God made them all like you.,"At the present time living people don't look half so natural.""","""Don't I look rather yellowish?""","""Quite in the spirit of the epoch, as you should be.","It is Russia--everyone here suffers from one ill or another.""",It is well known that barbers are flatterers of the first order and the most obliging people on earth.,"He bade him good-bye, and ran to overtake the coffin, moved by a keen desire to show for the last time his reverence for literature.",He caught up with the procession and the number of those who accompanied the coffin became ten.,The respect for the writer increased correspondingly.,"Passers-by exclaimed, astonished: ""Just look!",A writer's funeral!,Oh!,"Oh!""","And people who knew what was taking place thought, with a sort of pride, as they went about their business: ""It is plain that the importance of literature is being understood better and better by the country.""",The writer was now following his own coffin as if he were an admirer of literature and a friend of the deceased.,He addressed the lamplighter.,"""Did you know the deceased person?""","""Certainly; I made use of him in a small way.""","""I am very pleased to hear it.""","""Yes; our work is like that of the sparrow; where something drops we pick it up.""","""How am I to understand that?""","""Take it in a very simple manner, sir.""","""In a simple manner?""","""Yes, certainly.","Of course, it is a sin if one looks at it from a certain point of view.","One cannot, however, get on in this world without using ones wits.""","""H'm!","Are you sure of that?""","""Quite sure, sir.","There was a lamp right against his window, and every night he sat up till sunrise.","Well, I did not light that lamp because enough light streamed from his window.","So this one lamp was a net profit to me: he was a very useful man.""","So, talking quietly to this one and that, the writer reached the cemetery, and it came to pass that he had to make a speech about himself, because all those who accompanied him on that day had toothache.","This happened in Russia, and there people always have an ache of one sort or another.",He made a rather good speech.,"One paper went so far as to praise it in the following terms:-- ""One of the followers, who from his appearance we judged to be an actor, made a warm and touching oration over the grave, albeit from our point of view he no doubt over-estimated and exaggerated the rather modest merits of the deceased.","He was a writer of the old school who made no effort to rid himself of its defects--the naïve didactism, namely, and the over-insistence on the so-called civic duties--which to us nowadays have become so tiresome.","Nevertheless, the speech was delivered with a feeling of unquestionable love for the written word.""","When the speech had been duly made the writer lay down in the coffin and thought, quite satisfied with himself: ""There, we are ready now.","Everything has gone well and with dignity.""",At this point he became quite dead.,"Thus should one's calling be respected, even though it be literature.","THE MAN WITH A NATIONAL FACE Once upon a time there was a gentleman who had lived more than half his life, when he suddenly felt that something was lacking in him.",He was very much alarmed.,"He felt himself; everything seemed to be all right and in its place, his stomach was even protruding.","He examined himself in a looking-glass, and saw that he had eyes, ears, and everything else that a serious man should have.","He counted his fingers: there were ten right enough, and ten toes on his feet; but still he had an uncomfortable feeling that something was missing.",He was sadly puzzled.,"He asked his wife: ""What do you think, Mitrodora?","Is everything about me in order?""","She answered reassuringly: ""Everything.""","""But sometimes it seems to me----"" She was a religious woman and advised him: ""Whenever you begin to imagine anything, recite mentally: 'Let God arise and his enemies will fall.'""","He questioned his friends also, in a roundabout way.","They answered evasively, but looked at him suspiciously, as though he merited strong condemnation.","""What can it be?""","thought the gentleman, feeling downcast.",He tried to recall his past.,Everything seemed to be quite normal.,"He had been a socialist, had incited youths to revolt; but later on he had renounced everything, and for a long time now had strenuously trampled underfoot the ""crops"" himself had sown.","Generally speaking he had lived like everybody else, in accordance with the spirit and inspirations of the times.","He pondered and pondered and suddenly discovered what it was: ""O Lord, I haven't got a national face!""","He rushed to the looking-glass and saw that his face really had an indistinct expression, like that of a blind man.","It suggested a page of a translation from some foreign language, done carelessly by a more or less illiterate person who had omitted all punctuation, so that it was impossible to make out what was on the page.","It might be read as containing either a demand that one's soul should be sacrificed for the liberty of the people, or that it was necessary to recognise the full sway of absolutism.","""H'm, what a mixture, to be sure,"" thought the gentleman; and he decided at once: ""No, it is not the thing to live with a face like that.""","So he began to wash it every day with expensive soaps, but this did not help: the skin shone, but the indistinctness remained.","He began to lick his face with his tongue--his tongue was long and well adjusted, for at one time the gentleman had been engaged in journalism.",But even his tongue was of no avail.,"He applied Japanese massage to his face, and bumps appeared, as they do after a hard fight, but still he could obtain no definiteness of expression.","He tried and tried, but without success; all that he achieved was to lose a pound and a half in weight.","Suddenly to his joy he learned that the head constable of his district, von Judenfresser, was known for his understanding of national problems.","He went to him and said: ""Matters stand so-and-so, your Honour.","Cannot you help me in my trouble?""","The head constable of course was flattered: here was an educated man, not long since suspected of disloyalty to the throne, now asking advice with confidence on how to change the expression of his face.","The constable chuckled, and in his great joy exclaimed: ""There is nothing simpler, my dear friend, my American gem.",Rub your face against members of a subject nationality.,"Your real face will at once be revealed.""","The gentleman was pleased, the weight of a mountain fell from his shoulders.","He sniggered loyally and said to himself in some astonishment: ""Why could I not have guessed it myself?","The whole matter is so simple.""",They parted very good friends.,"The gentleman rushed out into the street, planted himself at a comer and waited.","Presently a Jew came along; he rushed up to him and began: ""If you,"" he said, ""are a Jew, you must become a Russian.","If you do not want to, then----"" The Jew (as is known from all anecdotes) belongs to a nervous and timid people.",But this one was of a capricious character and would not put up with pogroms.,"He raised his arm, gave the gentleman a blow on the left cheek, and went home to his family.","The gentleman leaned against the wall, rubbing his face, and thinking: ""Well, well, the formation of one's national face is connected with sensations not always altogether agreeable, but let it be.","Nekrassoff, although he was a poor poet, said quite truly:     ""Nothing can be got for naught:     Fate demands its victims.""",Suddenly a native of the Caucasus passed by.,As proved by all anecdotes they are an uncivilised and hot-headed people.,"He was singing as he walked along: ""Mitskhales sakles mingrule.","""[1] The gentleman pounced upon him: ""No,"" he said, ""be quiet.","If you are a Georgian you must become a Russian, and you must not love the hut of a Mingrelian, but what you are ordered to love.","You must like prison, even without orders----"" The Georgian left the gentleman in a horizontal position and went and drank Kachetin wine.","The gentleman lay on the ground and pondered: ""Well, well, there are also Tartars, Armenians, Bashkirs, Kirghises, Mordva, Lithuanians.","O Lord, what a number!",And these are not all.,"There are our own people, the Slavs.""","At this juncture a Little Russian came along, and of course he was singing in a very disloyal manner: ""Our ancestors once led A happy life in Ukraina...."" ""No,"" said the gentleman, rising to his feet.","""Will you be kind enough in future to use the letter 'y' instead of 'oo'[2]; otherwise you undermine the unity of the empire.""","He argued the point at some length, and the Little Russian listened, for, as proved most conclusively by all the collections of Little Russian anecdotes, the Little Russians are a very slow people, and like to do their work without hurrying.",Unfortunately this gentleman was somewhat insistent.,"Some kind people picked the gentleman up and asked him: ""Where do you live?""","""In Great Russia.""",Of course they took him to the police station.,"As they were driving along he felt his face, not without pride, though with a certain sense of pain.","It seemed to him that it had grown considerably broader and he thought to himself: ""I believe I have acquired ..."" He was taken before von Judenfresser, and the latter, like the humane person he was, sent for the police doctor.","When the doctor came they began to whisper to each other in surprise, and kept giggling, which seemed a strange thing to do in the circumstances.","""It is the first case in the whole of my practice,"" whispered the doctor.","""I cannot make it out.""","""What may that mean?""","thought the gentleman, and asked: ""Well, how do I look?""","""The old face is quite rubbed off,"" answered von Judenfresser.","""And generally speaking has my face changed?""","""Of course it has, only, you know----"" The doctor said consolingly: ""Your face is such, dear sir, that you may just as well put your trousers on it.""",So it remained for the rest of his life.,There is no moral here.,"[1] ""Love a Mingrelian hut.""","--_Trans._ [2] The Little Russians speak a dialect of the language in which the Russian sound for ""y"" is pronounced ""oo.""",THE LIBERAL There once lived a nobleman who liked to back up his statements by quoting history.,"Whenever he wanted to tell a lie, he went to a likely man and gave him the order: ""Egorka,[1] go and find me facts from history to prove that such-and-such a thing does not repeat itself, and vice versa.""","Egorka was a smart fellow, and readily found what was wanted.",The nobleman armed himself with these facts as occasion required and contrived to prove everything that was necessary.,"In fact, he was invincible.","He was, moreover, a plotter against the Government.",At one time everyone thought it necessary to conspire against the Government.,"They were not afraid even to say to one another: ""The English have habeas corpus, but we have ukases.""",And they made mock at these differences between nations.,"Having done that, they would forget the Government oppression under which they suffered, and sit down and play whist till the cocks crew for the third time.","When the cocks announced the approach of mom the nobleman commanded: ""Egorka, sing something inspiring, and suitable to the hour.""","Egorka stood up and, lifting his finger, reminded them in a manner full of meaning:     ""In Holy Russia the cocks crow,     It will soon be day in Holy Russia.""","""Quite true,"" said the nobleman; ""it will soon be day.""",And they retired to rest.,So far so good; but suddenly the people began to get agitated.,"The nobleman noticed this and asked: ""Egorka, why are the people restless?""","The latter looked pleased as he reported: ""The people want to live like human beings.""","""Well, who taught them that?",I did.,"For fifty years I and my ancestors have fostered in them the idea that it was time for them to live like human beings; haven't we?""",He began to get excited and pressed Egorka eagerly.,"""Find me facts from history about the agrarian movement in Europe.","Texts from the Gospels about equality, and from the history of civilisation about the origin of property.","Be quick about it.""",Egorka was pleased.,He perspired freely as he hurried hither and thither.,"He tore all the leaves out of the books, so that only the bindings were left.","He carried big bundles of all kinds of convincing proofs to the nobleman, who still kept urging him on.","""Stick to it!","When we have a constitution I will make you editor of a large Liberal paper.""",And becoming quite bold at last he began himself to speak to the more moderate of the peasants.,"""Besides,"" said he, ""there were the brothers Gracchus in Rome; then in England, in Germany, in France.... And all this is historically necessary.","Egorka, get me facts.""","Thereupon he proved, by facts, that every nation is bound to desire liberty, even against the wish of the authorities.","The peasants of course were pleased and cried: ""We thank you humbly.""","Everything went very well, harmoniously, in Christian love and mutual confidence, till suddenly the peasants began to ask: ""When are you going to clear out?""","""Clear out?","Where?""","""Away.""","""Where from?""","""Off the land.""","And they laughed, saying: ""What a funny fellow.","He understands everything, but he has ceased to understand what is simplest of all.""","They laughed, but the nobleman became angry.","""But listen to me,"" he said.","""Why should I go if the land is mine?""",But the peasants did not heed him.,"""How can it be yours when you have said yourself that it is the Lord's, and that even before the time of Jesus Christ there were some just men who knew it?""","He did not understand them, and they did not understand him.",So he went again to Egorka.,"""Egorka, look up the ancient histories and find me ..."" But the latter replied in a perfectly independent spirit: ""All the histories were pulled to pieces to prove the contrary.""","""You are lying, you plotter.""",He rushed to the library and saw that it was true.,Only the empty covers of the books remained.,"The surprise was so great that it threw him into a perspiration, and he began to appeal to his ancestors, saying sorrowfully: ""And who taught you to write history in such a one-sided manner?",Look what you have done.,Alas!,what kind of history is it?,"To the devil with it!""","But the peasants kept repeating the same thing: ""You have proved it all to us very clearly,"" they said.","""Get away as quickly as you can, or else we shall drive you away.""",Egorka had gone completely over to the peasants.,"When he met the nobleman he turned up his nose and laughed sneeringly: ""O you Liberal!","Habeas corpus!""",Things went from bad to worse.,The peasants sang songs and were in such high spirits that they carried off to their homes a stack of the nobleman's hay.,Suddenly the nobleman remembered that he had another card to play.,"In the entresol sat his great-grandmother, awaiting an inevitable death.","She was so old that she had forgotten all human words; she could only remember one thing: ""Don't give ..."" Since the year 1861[2] she had not been able to say anything else.","He hastened to her, his feelings greatly agitated.","He fell at her feet affectionately and appealed to her: ""Mother of mothers, you are a living history....""

'No,' we said, 'why should we?","Our people are all right, they are humble and obedient, they are not going to give us any trouble.'","So now, you good fellows, instead of getting excited like this, don't you think you had better go and shake up the Jews a bit?",What do you say to that?,"What else are they for?""","The people pondered and pondered; they saw that they could get no redress, so they decided to act upon the suggestion of the authorities.","""Well, fellows,"" they said, ""with God's blessing we will smash them.""",They ransacked fifty houses and killed a few Jews.,"But they soon tired of their labours, and, their desire for reforms being satisfied, everything went on as before.","Besides the authorities, the native population and the Jews, there lived some kind-hearted people in the state.",Their function was to divert agitation into other channels and to quiet passions.,"After each pogrom their whole number came together, eighteen men in all, and sent forth to the world their written protest, thus: ""Although we know the Jews are Russian subjects, we are nevertheless convinced that they ought not to be utterly exterminated, and, therefore, taking all considerations into account, we hereby express our condemnation of this extreme persecution of living people.","(_Signed_) High-Brow, Narrow-Chin, Long-Hair, Biting-Lip, Yea and Nay, Big Bellows, Joseph Three-Ear, Noisy-One, Know-All, Cyril Just-So, Flow-of-Words, Look-Wise, Quill-Driver, Lieutenant-Colonel (retired) Drink-no-Beer, Narym (solicitor), Busybody, On-All-Fours and Grisha In-the-Future, seven years old, a boy.""","These protests appeared after each pogrom with the only difference that the age of Grisha kept changing and that Quill-Driver signed on behalf of Narym,[1] who was suddenly exiled to a town bearing the same name.","Sometimes the provinces responded to these protests: ""We sympathise and add our signatures,"" Pull-Apart telegraphed from Sleepy-Town, and Featherbrain from Daft Town; Samogryzoff ""and others"" from Okuroff also joined in.","It was clear to everybody that ""the others"" were an invention, to make the message look more formidable, for there were no others in Okuroff.","The Jews were greatly distressed when they read these protests, and on one occasion one of them, who was a very shrewd man, made the following proposal:-- ""Do you know what?",You don't?,"Well, let us hide all the pens and ink and paper before the next pogrom, and see what these eighteen people, including Grisha, will do then.""",These Jews knew how to act together.,"Once decided, they bought up and hid all the paper and pens and poured all the ink into the Black Sea.",Then they quietly awaited the result.,"They had not long to wait: the necessary permission was received from the authorities, a pogrom took place, the hospitals were full of Jews--and the humanitarians were running about St Petersburg looking for pens and paper.",They could find none anywhere except in the offices of the authorities.,And the latter would not give them any.,"""What do you take us for?""",they said.,"""We know what you want it for.","No, you must do without it this time.""","""But how can we?""",Mr Busybody entreated them.,"""Well,"" they answered, ""you ought to realise by now that we have given you plenty of chances to protest.""","Grisha, who was already forty-three years old, cried: ""I want to protest.""",But there was nothing to protest on.,"A happy thought struck Know-All: ""Shall we write something on the fence at least?""","There were no fences in St Petersburg, only iron railings.","But they proceeded to the outskirts of the town, where, near the slaughterhouses, they came upon an old fence.","No sooner, however, had Mr High-Brow made the first letter in chalk than, suddenly, as if dropping from the skies came a policeman and began to expostulate with him: ""What does this mean?","When boys do this sort of thing they are whipped, but you, staid gentlemen, what are you doing?""","Of course he could not understand them, taking them for writers old enough to be writing their thousand and first article.","They were nonplussed, and, scattering literally in all directions, went home.","So that one pogrom was not protested against, and the humanitarians were deprived of a pleasure.","People who understand the psychology of races say rightly: ""The Jews are a shrewd people.""",[1] A well-known place of exile in Siberia.,"HARD TO PLEASE Tired of their struggle with those who had opinions of their own, the authorities, wishing at last to rest on their laurels, once issued the following stringent order:-- ""Hereby you are commanded to drag out into the light of day all those who have opinions of their own, to drag them out unceremoniously from their hiding-places, and to exterminate them by any measures that may seem necessary.""","The execution of this order was entrusted to Oronty Strevenko, who had volunteered to exterminate living human beings of both sexes and of all ages.","He was an ex-captain in the service of his Highness the King of the Fuegians, and an important personage in Terra del Fuego.",For his services Oronty was allowed sixteen thousand roubles.,"Oronty obtained the commission not because others could not be found as base, but because he looked unnaturally fierce, and was covered with an abundant growth of hair, which enabled him to go naked in all climates.","Besides, he had four rows of teeth, sixty-four in all, a circumstance that won for him the special confidence of the authorities.","But in spite of all these advantages even he was confronted by the thought: ""How are they to be unearthed?","They keep so quiet.""",And in truth the inhabitants of this town were remarkably well trained.,"They went in fear of one another, seeing in everyone an agent-provocateur, and never asserted anything.","Even in their talks with their mothers they spoke in a form agreed upon, and in a foreign language: ""N'est ce pas?""","""Maman, it is time to dine, n'est ce pas?'","""Maman, we ought to go to the cinema show to-night, n'est ce pas?""","However, after much thought, Strevenko devised a plan for unearthing secret plots.","He washed his hair with peroxide of hydrogen, shaved himself where necessary, and became a fairhaired individual of gloomy appearance.",Then he put on a sad-coloured suit so that no one could recognise him.,"At night he went out into the street, and walked about as if deep in thought.","Noticing a citizen stealing along, he pounced upon him from the left and whispered in a provocative manner: ""Comrade, are you really satisfied with your existence?""","The citizen slackened his pace, as if considering the question; but as soon as a policeman appeared in the distance he shouted in accordance with his invariable practice: ""Policeman, hold him.""","Strevenko sprang over the fence like a tiger, and as he sat in the stinging nettles thought to himself: ""You cannot get hold of them like this; they act in a perfectly legal manner, the devils.""",In the meantime the money allowed him was disappearing.,"He put on a less dismal-looking suit, and tried another way of trapping people.","Boldly approaching a citizen he would ask him: ""Would you like to become an agent-provocateur, sir?""","And the citizen would reply coolly: ""What is the salary?""","Others declined politely: ""No, thank you, I am already engaged.""","""Well,"" thought Oronty, ""how am I to catch them?""",In the meantime the money allowed him was gradually melting away.,"In the course of his search he looked in at the headquarters of the Society for the Many-Sided Use of Empty Egg-Shells, but discovered that the society enjoys the exalted patronage of three bishops, and of a general of gendarmerie; that it meets once a year and gets a special permit each time from St Petersburg.",Oronty still failed to catch plotters and the money allowed him seemed to him to have galloping consumption.,"Oronty was thoroughly annoyed: ""I'll soon show them!""",And he began to act quite openly.,"He would go up to a citizen and ask him straight out: ""Are you satisfied with your existence?""","""Quite satisfied.""","""Well, but the authorities are dissatisfied.","Please come along.""","And if anyone said that he was not satisfied, the result was, of course, the same: ""Take him along!""",said Strevenko.,"""But, excuse me.""","""What?""","""But I am dissatisfied because their measures are not sufficiently rigorous.""","""Indeed?","Take him.""","Thus, in the course of three weeks, he had gathered together ten thousand men and women of one sort and another.",At first he imprisoned them where he could; then he began to hang them; but for the sake of economy he did it at the expense of the citizens themselves.,"Everything went very well till, one day, a superior official, who chanced to be out beagling in the outskirts of the town, saw unusual animation in the fields; a picture of the peaceful activity of citizens presented itself to him.","They were reviling one another, hanging and burying one another, whilst Strevenko walked amongst them staff in hand, barking out words of encouragement: ""Hurry up, you melancholy owl, and be more cheerful about it!","And you reverend-looking old man, there, why do you look so stupefied?",The noose is ready; get into it; don't keep the others waiting.,"Whoa, lad; why do you get into the noose before your father?","Gentlemen, don't be in such a hurry; your turn will come right enough.","You have been patient for years, awaiting pacification by the Government;

541 persons of both sexes have been hanged; 937 persons of both sexes have been crippled for life; 317 persons of both sexes have died prematurely; 63 persons of both sexes have committed suicide; total number exterminated, 1876.","""Total Cost: Roubles 16,884--_i.e._ at the rate of 7 roubles per person.","""Deficit: Roubles 884.""","The superior official, was staggered.","He muttered in a fury: ""A deficit!",You Fuegian!,"The whole of your Terra Del Fuego, together with the king and you yourself, is not worth eight hundred roubles.",Just think of it!,"If you are going to steal money like that what am I to do?--I, who occupy a rank ten times higher?",If we have such appetites Russia won't last us three years.,There are many others besides you who want to live.,Can't you understand that?,"And besides, you have wrongly included three hundred and eighty persons, for three hundred and seventeen 'died prematurely' and sixty-three committed suicide.","You swindler, you have included them as well.""","""Your Excellency,"" Oronty tried to justify himself, ""but I drove them into such a state of mind that they loathed their life.""","""And seven roubles a head for that?","Besides, no doubt a lot of those included were not concerned in the matter at all.",The total population of the town is only twelve thousand.,"No, my friend, I will bring you before the court.""","A very strict investigation was accordingly made into the activity of the Fuegian, and he was found guilty of having misappropriated nine hundred and sixteen roubles belonging to the Treasury.","The court that tried Oronty was a just one;
