    An’ Nance an’ me believe in our parson’s innovations;     We ain’t much skeered o’ Rome, an’ we reckon he can preach some,     An’ we call that evenin’ sarvice a Providential Dispensation.","_THE SUCCOUR OF GLUSKÂP_ (A MICMAC LEGEND)     The happy valley laughed with sun,       The corn grew firm in stalk,     The lodges clustered safe where run       The streams of Peniawk.",The washing-pools and shallows rang       With shout of lads at play;     At corn-hoeing the women sang;       The warriors were away.,"The splashed white pebbles on the beach,       The idling paddles, gleamed;     Before the lodge doors, spare of speech,       The old men basked and dreamed.","And when the windless noon grew hot,       And the white sun beat like steel,     In shade about the shimmering pot       They gathered to their meal.","Then from the hills, on flying feet,       A desperate runner came,     With cry that smote the peaceful street,       And slew the peace with shame.","‘Trapped in the night, and snared in sleep,       Our warriors wake no more!","Up from Wahloos the Mohawks creep--       Their feet are at the door!’     The grey old sachems rose and mocked       The ruin that drew near;     And down the beach the children flocked,       And women wild with fear.","Launched were the red canoes; when, lo!","Beside them Gluskâp stood,     Appearing with his giant bow       From out his mystic wood.","With quiet voice he called them back,       And comforted their fears;     He swore the lodges should not lack,       He dried the children’s tears;     Till sorrowing mothers almost deemed       The desperate runner lied,     And the tired children slept, and dreamed       Their fathers had not died.","That night behind the mystic wood       The Mohawk warriors crept;     A spell went through the solitude       And stilled them, and they slept.","And when the round moon, rising late,       The Hills of Kawlm had crossed,     She saw the camp of Mohawk hate       Swathed in a great white frost.","At morn, behind the mystic wood       Came Gluskâp, bow in hand,     And marked the ice-bound solitude,       And that unwaking band.","But as he gazed his lips grew mild,       For, safe among the dead,     There played a ruddy, laughing child       By a captive mother’s head;     And child and mother, nestling warm,       Scarce knew their foes had died,     As past their sleep the noiseless storm       Of strange death turned aside.","_HOW THE MOHAWKS SET OUT FOR MEDOCTEC_ [When the invading Mohawks captured the outlying Melicite village of Madawaska, they spared two squaws to guide them down stream to the main Melicite town of Medoctec, below Grand Falls.",The squaws steered themselves and their captors over the Falls.],"I     Grows the great deed, though none     Shout to behold it done!","To the brave deed done by night     Heaven testifies in the light     Stealthy and swift as a dream,     Crowding the breast of the stream,     In their paint and plumes of war     And their war-canoes four score,     They are threading the Oolastook,     Where his cradling hills o’erlook.",The branchy thickets hide them;     The unstartled waters guide them.,"II     Comes night to the quiet hills     Where the Madawaska spills,--     To his slumbering huts no warning,     Nor mirth of another morning!","No more shall the children wake     As the dawns through the hut-door break;     But the dogs, a trembling pack,     With wistful eyes steal back.","And, to pilot the noiseless foe     Through the perilous passes, go     Two women who could not die--     Whom the knife in the dark passed by.","III     Where the shoaling waters froth,     Churned thick like devils’ broth,--     Where the rocky shark-jaw waits,     Never a bark that grates.",And the tearless captives’ skill     Contents them.,Onward still!,"And the low-voiced captives tell     The tidings that cheer them well:     How a clear stream leads them down     Well-nigh to Medoctec town,     Ere to the great Falls’ thunder     The long wall yawns asunder.","IV     The clear stream glimmers before them;     The faint night falters o’er them;     Lashed lightly bark to bark,     They glide the windless dark.",Late grows the night.,No fear     While the skilful captives steer!,"Sleeps the tired warrior, sleeps     The chief; and the river creeps.","V     In the town of the Melicite     The unjarred peace is sweet,     Green grows the corn and great,     And the hunt is fortunate.",This many a heedless year     The Mohawks come not near.,The lodge-gate stands unbarred;     Scarce even a dog keeps guard.,"No mother shrieks from a dream     Of blood on the threshold stream,--     But the thought of those mute guides     Is where the sleeper bides!","VI     Gets forth those caverned walls     No roar from the giant Falls,     Whose mountainous foam treads under     The abyss of awful thunder.",But--the river’s sudden speed!,How the ghost-grey shores recede!,And the tearless pilots hear     A muttering voice creep near.,A tremor!,The blanched waves leap.,The warriors start from sleep.,"Faints in the sudden blare     The cry of their swift despair,     And the captives’ death-chant shrills ...","But afar, remote from ills,     Quiet under the quiet skies     The Melicite village lies.","_THE WOOD FROLIC_     The Morning Star was bitter bright, the morning sky was grey;     And we hitched our teams and started for the woods at break of day.","_Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_     Along the white and winding road the sled-bells jangled keen     Between the buried fences, the billowy drifts between.","_Oh, merry swing the axes, and the bright chips fly!_     So crisp sang the runners, and so swift the horses sped,     That the woods were all about us ere the sky grew red.","_Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_     The bark hung ragged on the birch, the lichen on the fir,     The lungwort fringed the maple, and grey moss the juniper.","_Oh, merry swing the axes, and the bright chips fly!_     So still the air and chill the air the branches seemed asleep,     But we broke their ancient visions as the axe bit deep.","_Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_     With the shouts of the choppers and the barking of their blades,     How rang the startled valleys and the rabbit-haunted glades!","_Oh, merry swing the axes, and the bright chips fly!_     The hard wood and the soft wood, we felled them for our use;     And chiefly, for its scented gum, we loved the scaly spruce;         _Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_     And here and there, with solemn roar, some hoary tree came down,     And we heard the rolling of the years in the thunder of its crown.","_Oh, merry swing the axes, and the bright chips fly!_     So, many a sled was loaded up above the stake-tops soon;     And many a load was at the farm before the horn of noon;         _Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_     And ere we saw the sundown all yellow through the trees,     The farmyard stood as thick with wood as a buckwheat patch with bees;         _Oh, merry swing the axes, and the bright chips fly!_     And with the last-returning teams, and axes burnished bright,     We left the woods to slumber in the frosty shadowed night.","_Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_     And then the wide, warm kitchen, with beams across the ceiling,     Thick hung with red-skinned onions, and homely herbs of healing!","_Oh, merry swing the axes, and the bright chips fly!_     The dishes on the dresser-shelves were shining blue and white,     And o’er the loaded table the lamps beamed bright.","_Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_     Then, how the ham and turkey and the apple-sauce did fly,     The heights of boiled potatoes and the flats of pumpkin-pie!","_Oh, merry swing the axes, and the bright chips fly!_     With bread-and-cheese and doughnuts fit to feed a farm a year!",And we washed them down with tides of tea and oceans of spruce beer.,"_Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_     At last the pipes were lighted and the chairs pushed back,     And Bill struck up a sea-song on a rather risky tack;         _Oh, merry swing the axes, and the bright chips fly!_     And the girls all thought it funny--but they never knew ’twas worse,     For we gagged him with a doughnut at the famous second verse.","_Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_     Then someone fetched a fiddle, and we shoved away the table,     And ’twas jig and reel and polka just as long as we were able,         _Oh, merry swing the axes, and the bright chips fly!_     Till at last the girls grew sleepy, and we got our coats to go.","We started off with racing-teams and moonlight on the snow;         _Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_     And soon again the winter world was voiceless as of old,     Alone with all the wheeling stars, and the great white cold.","_Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_           _CANADIAN STREAMS_     O rivers rolling to the sea     From lands that bear the maple-tree,       How swell your voices with the strain     Of loyalty and liberty!","A holy music, heard in vain     By coward heart and sordid brain,       To whom this strenuous being seems     Naught but a greedy race for gain.",O unsung streams--not splendid themes     Ye lack to fire your patriot dreams!,"Annals of glory gild your waves,     Hope freights your tides, Canadian streams!","St. Lawrence, whose wide water laves     The shores that ne’er have nourished slaves!",Swift Richelieu of lilied fame!,Niagara of glorious graves!,"Thy rapids, Ottawa, proclaim     Where Daulac and his heroes came!","Thy tides, St. John, declare La Tour,     And, later, many a loyal name!","Thou inland stream, whose vales, secure     From storm, Tecumseh’s death made poor!","And thou small water, red with war,     ’Twixt Beaubassin and Beauséjour!","Dread Saguenay, where eagles soar,     What voice shall from the bastioned shore       The tale of Roberval reveal,     Or his mysterious fate deplore?","Annapolis, do thy floods yet feel     Faint memories of Champlain’s keel,       Thy pulses yet the deed repeat     Of Poutrincourt and d’Iberville?","And thou far tide, whose plains now beat     With march of myriad westering feet,       Saskatchewan, whose virgin sod     So late Canadian blood made sweet?","Your bulwark hills, your valleys broad,     Streams where de Salaberry trod,       Where Wolfe achieved, where Brock was slain,--     Their voices are the voice of God!"
