exactly are all these?""",he murmured.,"""Something valuable, I would think.""",He picked up a round drum and opened it.,"A spool fell to the floor, unwinding a black ribbon.","He examined it, holding it up to the light.","""Look at this!""",They came around him.,"""Pictures,"" Nasha said.","""Tiny pictures.""","""Records of some kind.""",Tance closed the spool up in the drum again.,"""Look,
