         London’s despotic rule in things           dramatic.","In its first season it produced nine           plays (three altogether new), including           John Galsworthy’s play, “Strife,” which           had just been produced in London.",The second season commenced on September           5th.,"In it thirteen plays were produced,           including the first production in           English of a play by the Russian           dramatist, Anton Tchekhov, “The           Seagull,” and six entirely new plays.","In the Spring season, 1910, “Justice,”            produced simultaneously in London,           created an unique record in the history           of the British stage, while astonishing           success attended the production of John           Masefield’s masterpiece, “The Tragedy of           Nan.” In all, seven entirely new plays           were produced.","The Summer season of lighter fare added           six more plays to the record, including           two new ones.","In the fifth season ten           plays were produced, four entirely new.","In the sixth season, Spring, 1911,           fifteen plays were produced, seven           entirely new.","In all seventy-three plays           have been produced, of which about           fifty-five would never have been seen           but for the energies of this Theatre.","End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of
