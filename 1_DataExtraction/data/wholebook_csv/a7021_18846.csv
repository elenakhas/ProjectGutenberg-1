Voices took up the thud-thud of the drums, the heads of the squatting men moved in a slow swing from side to side.","Tau's hand closed about Dane's wrist and the younger man looked around, startled, to see that the medic's eyes were alight, that he was watching the assembly with the alertness of Sindbad approaching prey.","""Calculate the stowage space in Number One hold!""","That amazing order, delivered in a whisper, shocked Dane into obeying it.","Number One hold ... there were three divisions now and the stowage was--He became aware that for a small space of time he had escaped the net being woven by the beat of the drum, the drone of voices, the nodding of heads.",He moistened his lips.,So that was how it worked!,"He had heard Tau speak often enough about self-hypnotism under such conditions, but this was the first time the meaning of it had been clear.","Two men were shuffling out of nowhere, wearing nothing on their dark bodies but calf-length kilts of tails, black tails with fluffy white tips, which swayed uniformly in time to their pacing feet.",Their heads and shoulders were masked by beautifully cured and semi-mounted animal heads displaying half-open jaws with double pairs of curved fangs.,"The black-and-white striped fur, the sharply pointed ears, were neither canine nor feline, but a weird combination of the two.",Dane gabbled two trading formulas under his breath and tried to think of the relation of Samantine rock coinage to galactic credits.,Only this time his defenses did not work.,From between the two shuffling dancers padded something on four feet.,"The canine-feline creature was more than just a head; it was a loose-limbed, graceful body fully eight feet in length, and the red eyes in the prick-eared head were those of a confident killer.","It walked without restraint, lazily, with arrogance, its white-tufted tail swinging.","And when it reached the mid-point of the terrace, it flung up its head as if to challenge.","But words issued from between those curved fangs, words which Dane might not understand but which undoubtedly held meaning for the men nodding in time to the hypnotic cadence of that da--da--da....","""Beautiful!""","Tau spoke in honest admiration, his own eyes almost as feral as those of the talking beast as he leaned forward, his fists on his knees.","Now the animal was dancing also, its paws following the pace set by the masked attendants.",It must be a man in an animal skin.,But Dane could hardly believe that.,The illusion was too perfect.,His own hands went to the knife sheath at his belt.,"Out of deference to local custom they had left their stun rods in the palace, but a belt knife was an accepted article of apparel.","Dane slid the blade out surreptitiously, setting its point against the palm of his hand and jabbing painfully.",This was another of Tau's answers for breaking a spell.,But the white and black creature continued to dance; there was no blurring of its body lines into those of a human being.,"It sang on in a high-pitched voice, and Dane noted that those of the audience nearest the stools where Asaki and the captain were seated now watched the Chief Ranger and the space officer.",He felt Tau tense beside him.,"""Trouble coming...."" The warning from Tau was the merest thread of sound.","Dane forced himself to look away from the swaying cat-dog, to watch instead the singers who were now furtively eying their lord and his guest.",The Terran knew that there were feudal bonds between the Ranger and his men.,But suppose this was a showdown between Lumbrilo and Asaki--whose side would these men take?,"He watched Captain Jellico's hand slide across his knee, his fingers drop in touching distance of knife hilt.","And the hand of the Chief Ranger, hanging lax at his side, suddenly balled into a fist.","""So!""",Tau expelled the word as a hiss.,He moved with sure-footed speed.,Now he passed between the stools to confront the dancing cat-dog.,Yet he did not look at that weird creature and its attendants.,"Instead his arms were flung high as if to ward off--or perhaps welcome--something on the mountain side as he shouted: ""_Hodi, eldama!","Hodi!_"" As one, those on the terrace turned, looked up toward the slope.","Dane was on his feet, holding his knife as he might a sword.","Though of what use its puny length would be against that huge bulk moving in slow majesty toward them, he did not try to think.","Gray-dark trunk curled upward between great ivory tusks, ears went wide as ponderous feet crunched volcanic soil.","Tau moved forward, his hands still upraised, clearly in greeting.",That trunk touched skyward as if in salute to the man who could be crushed under one foot.,"""_Hodi, eldama!_"" For the second time Tau hailed the monster elephant and the trunk raised in silent greeting from one lord of an earth to another he recognized as an equal.","Perhaps it had been a thousand years since man and elephant had stood so, and then there had been only war and death between them.",Now there was peace and a current of power flowing from one to the other.,"Dane sensed this, saw the men on the terrace likewise drawing back from the unseen tie between the medic and the bull he had so clearly summoned.",Then Tau's upheld hands came together in a sharp clap and men held their breath in wonder.,Where the great bull had stood there was nothing--except rocks in the sun.,"As Tau swung around to face the cat-dog, that creature had no substance either.","For he fronted no animal but a man, a small, lean man whose lips wrinkled back from his teeth in a snarl.","His attendant priests fell back, leaving the spaceman and the witch doctor alone.","""Lumbrilo's magic is great,"" Tau said evenly.","""I hail Lumbrilo of Khatka.""",His hand made the open-palmed salute of peace.,The snarl faded as the man brought his face under control.,"He stood naked, but he was clothed in inherit dignity.","And there was power with that dignity, power and a pride before which even the more physically impressive Chief Ranger might have to give place.","""You have magic also, outlander,"" he replied.","""Where walks this long-toothed shadow of yours now?""","""Where once the men of Khatka walked, Lumbrilo.","For it was men of your blood who long, long past hunted this shadow of mine and made its body their prey.""","""So that it now might have a blood debt to settle with us, outlander?""","""That you said, not I, man of power.","You have shown us one beast, I have shown another.","Who can say which of them is stronger when it issues forth from the shadows?""","Lumbrilo pattered forward, his bare feet making little sound on the stones of the terrace.",Now he was only an arm's-length away from the medic.,"""You have challenged me, off-world man.""",Was that a question or a statement?,Dane wondered.,"""Why should I challenge you, Lumbrilo?",To each race its own magic.,"I come not to offer battle.""",His eyes held steady with the Khatkan's.,"""You have challenged me.""",Lumbrilo turned away and then looked back over his shoulder.,"""The strength you depend upon may become a broken staff, off-worlder.","Remember my words in the time when shadows become substance, and substance the thinnest of shadows!""","III ""You are truly a man of power!""",Tau shook his head in answer to that outburst from Asaki.,"""Not so, sir.",Your Lumbrilo is a man of power.,"I drew upon his power and you saw the results.""","""Deny it not!","What we saw never walked this world.""",Tau slung the strap of a trail bag over his shoulder.,"""Sir, once men of your blood, men who bred your race, hunted the elephant.","They took his tusks for their treasure, feasted upon his flesh--yes, and died beneath the trampling of his feet when they were unlucky or unwary.","So there is that within you which can even now be awakened to remember _eldama_ in his might when he was king of the herd and need fear nothing save the spears and cunning of small, weak men.","Lumbrilo had already awakened your minds to see what he willed you to see.""","""How does he do this?""",asked the other simply.,"""Is it magic that we see not Lumbrilo but a lion before us?""","""He weaves his spell with the drums, with the chant, by the suggestion his mind imposes upon yours.","And, having woven his spell, he cannot limit it to just the picture he suggests if ancient racial memories raise another.","I merely used the tools of Lumbrilo to show you yet another picture your people once knew well.""","""And in so doing made an enemy.""",Asaki stood before a rack of very modern weapons.,"Now he made his selection, a silver tube with a stock curved to fit a man's shoulder.","""Lumbrilo will not forget.""",Tau laughed shortly.,"""No, but then I have merely done as you wished, have I not, sir?","I have focused on myself the enmity of a dangerous man, and now you hope I shall be forced, in self-defense, to remove him from your path.""","The Khatkan turned slowly, resting the weapon across his forearm.","""I do not deny that, spaceman.""","""Then matters here are indeed serious--"" ""They are so serious,"" Asaki interrupted, speaking not only to Tau but to the other off-worlders as well, ""that what happens now may mean the end of the Khatka that I know.",Lumbrilo is the most dangerous game I have faced in a lifetime as a hunter.,"He goes, or we draw his fangs--or else all that I am, all I have labored here to build, will be swept away.","To preserve this I will use any weapon.""","""And I am now your weapon, which you hope will be as successful as that needler you are carrying.""","Tau laughed again, without much humor.","""Let us hope I shall prove as effective.""",Jellico moved out of the shadows.,"It was just after dawn, and the grayness of the vanishing night still held in the corners of the armory.",Deliberately he took his own stand before the arms racks and chose a short-barreled blaster.,Only when its butt was cupped in his hand did he glance at his host.,"""We came guesting, Asaki.","We have eaten salt and bread under this roof.""","""On my body and my blood it is,"" returned the Khatkan grimly.","""I shall go down to the blackness of Sabra before you do, if the flames of death are against us.""",From his belt he flipped loose his knife and offered the hilt to Jellico.,"""My body for a wall between you and the dark, Captain.","But also understand this: to me, what I do now is greater than the life of any one man.",Lumbrilo and the evil behind him must be rooted out.,"There was no trickery in my invitation!""","They stood eye to eye, equal in height, in authority of person, and that indefinable something which made them both masters in their own different worlds.","Then Jellico's hand went out, his fingertip flicked the hilt of the bared blade.","""There was no trickery,"" he conceded.","""I knew that your need was great when you came to the _Queen_.""","Since both the captain and Tau appeared to accept the situation, Dane, not quite understanding it all, was prepared to follow their lead.",And for the moment they had nothing more in plan than to visit the Zoboru preserve.,"They went by flitter--Asaki, one of his Hunter pilots, and the three from the _Queen_--lifting over the rim of mountains behind the fortress-palace and speeding north with the rising sun a flaming ball to the east.","Below, the country was stark--rocks and peaks, deep purple shadows marking the veins of crevices.","But that was swiftly behind and they were over a sea of greens, many shades of green, with yellow, blue, even red cutting into the general verdant carpet of treetops.","Another chain of heights and then open land, swales of tall grass already burnt yellow by the steady sun.","There was a river here, a crazy, twisted stream coiling nearly back upon itself at times.","Once more broken land, land so ravished by prehistoric volcanic action that it was a grotesque nightmare of erosion-whittled outcrops and mesas.",Asaki pointed to the east.,There was a dark patch widening out into a vast wedge.,"""The swamp of Mygra.","It has not yet been explored.""","""You could air map it,"" Tau began.",The Chief Ranger was frowning.,"""Four flitters have been lost trying that.",Com reports fail when they cross that last mountain ridge eastward.,There is some sort of interference which we do not yet understand.,Mygra is a place of death; later we may be able to travel along its fringe and then you shall see.,"Now--"" He spoke to the pilot in his own tongue and the flitter pointed up-nose at an angle as they climbed over the highest peak they had yet seen in this mountainous land, to reach at last a country of open grass dotted with small forest stands.",Jellico nodded approvingly.,"""Zoboru?""","""Zoboru,"" Asaki assented.","""We shall go up to the northern end of the preserve.",I wish to show you the roosts of the fastals.,This is their nesting season and the sight is one you will long remember.,"But we shall take an eastern course; I have two Ranger stations to check on the way.""","It was after they left the second station that the flitter swung farther out eastward, again climbing over the chain of heights to sight one of the newly discovered wonders the staff at the last station had reported--a crater lake.","And the flitter skimmed down across water which was a rich emerald in hue, filling the crater from one rock wall to the other with no beach at the foot of those precipitant cliffs.","As the machine arose to clear the far wall, Dane tensed.",One of his duties aboard the _Queen_ was flitter pilot for planetwise trips.,"And ever since they had taken off that morning he had unconsciously flown with the Khatkan pilot, anticipating each change or adjustment of the controls.","Now he felt that sluggish response to the other's lift signal, and instinctively his own hand went out to adjust a power feed lever.","They made the rise, were well above the danger of the cliff wall.",But the machine was not responding properly.,Dane did not need to watch the pilot's swiftly moving hands to guess that they were in trouble.,And his slight concern deepened into something else as the flitter began to drop nose again.,"In front of him, Captain Jellico shifted uneasily, and Dane knew that he, too, was alerted.",Now the pilot had plunged the power adjuster to the head against the control board.,But the nose of the flitter acted as if it were overweighted or magnetically attracted by the rocks below.,The best efforts of the man flying it could not keep it level.,"They were being drawn earthward, and all the pilot could do only delayed the inevitable crack-up.","The Khatkan was turning the machine north to avoid what lay below, for here a long arm of the Mygra swamp clasped about the foot of the mountain.",The Chief Ranger spoke into the mike of the com unit while the pilot continued to fight against the pull which was bringing them down.,"Now the small machine was below the level of the volcanic peak which cradled the lake, and the mountain lay between them and the preserve.","Asaki gave a muffled exclamation, slapped the com box, spoke more sharply into the mike.",It was apparent he was not getting the results he wanted.,"Then with a quick glance about he snapped an order: ""Strap in!""",His Terran companions had already buckled the wide webbing belts intended to save them from crash shock.,Dane saw the pilot push the button to release fend cushions.,"In spite of his pounding heart, a small fraction of his brain recognized the other's skill as the Khatkan took a course to bring them down on a relatively level patch of sand and gravel.",Dane raised his head from the shelter of his folded arms.,"The Chief Ranger was busy with the pilot, who lay limply against the controls.",Captain Jellico and Tau were already pulling at the buckles of their protective crash belts.,But one look at the front of the flitter told Dane that it would not take to the air again without extensive repairs.,"Its nose was bent up and back, obscuring the forward view completely.","However, the pilot had made a miraculously safe landing considering the terrain.","Ten minutes later, the pilot restored to consciousness and the gash in his head bandaged, they held a council of war.","""The com was off, too.","I did not have a chance to report before the crash,"" Asaki put the situation straightly.","""And our exploring parties have not yet mapped this side of the range; it has a bad reputation because of the swamp.""",Jellico measured the heights now to their west with resigned eyes.,"""Looks as if we climb.""","""Not here,"" the Chief Ranger corrected him.","""There is no passing through the crater lake region on foot.","We must travel south along the edge of the mountain area until we do find a scalable way into the preserve region.""","""You seem very certain we are not going to be rescued if we stay right here,"" Tau observed.","""Why?""","""Because I'm inclined to believe that any flitter that tries to reach us may run into the same trouble.","Also, they have no com fix on us.","It will be at least a day or more before they will even begin to count us missing, and then they will have the whole northern portion of the preserve to comb; there are not enough men here--I can give you a multitude of reasons, Medic.""","""One of which might be sabotage?""",demanded Jellico.,Asaki shrugged.,"""Perhaps.",I am not loved in some quarters.,But there may also be something fatal to flitters here as there is over Mygra.,"We thought the crater lake district safely beyond the swamp influence, but it may not be so.""","But you took the chance of traveling over it, Dane thought, though he did not comment aloud.",Was this another of the Chief Ranger's attempts to involve them in some private trouble of his own?,Though to deliberately smash up a flitter and set them all afoot in this wilderness was a pretty drastic move.,Asaki had started to unload emergency supplies from the flitter.,They each had a trail bag for a pack.,"But when the pilot staggered over to pull out a set of stass belts and Jellico began to uncoil them, the Chief Ranger shook his head.","""With the feeder beam shut off by the mountains, I fear those will no longer work.""",Jellico tossed one on the crumpled nose of the flitter and punched its button with the tip of the needler barrel.,Then he threw a rock at the dangling belt.,"The stone landed, taking the wide protective band with it to the ground.",That force field which should have warded off the missile was not working.,"""Oh, fine!""",Tau opened his trail bag to pack concentrates.,Then he smiled crookedly.,"""We aren't signed in for killing licenses, sir.","Do you pay our fines if we are forced to shoot a hole through something that disputes the right of way?""","To Dane's surprise, the Chief Ranger laughed.","""You are off preserve now, Medic Tau.",The rules do not cover wild land.,"But I would suggest we now hunt a cave before nightfall.""","""Lions?""",asked Jellico.,"Dane, remembering the black and white beast Lumbrilo had presented, did not enjoy that thought.","They had--his gaze went from man to man checking weapons--the needler Asaki carried, and another the pilot had slung by its carrying strap over his shoulder.","Tau and the captain both were armed with blasters and he had a fire ray and a force blade, both considered small arms but deadly enough perhaps even to dampen a lion's enthusiasm for the chase.","""Lions, graz, rock apes,"" Asaki fastened the mouth of his trail bag.","""All are hunters or killers.","The graz send out scouts, and they are big and formidable enough to have no enemies.",Lions hunt with intelligence and skill.,"Rock apes are dangerous, but luckily they cannot keep silent when they scent their prey and so give one warning.""","As they climbed up-slope from the flitter, Dane, looking back, saw that perhaps Asaki was right in his belief that they had better try to help themselves rather than wait for rescue.","Putting aside the excuse of fearing another crack-up, the wrecked flitter made no outstanding mark on the ground.","The higher they climbed, the less it could be distinguished from the tumble of rocks about it.","He had lagged a little behind and, when he hurried to catch up, found Jellico standing with his distance vision lenses to his eyes, directing them toward that shadow marking the swamp.","As the younger spaceman reached him, the captain lowered the glasses and spoke: ""Take your knife, Thorson, and hold it close to that rock--over there.""",He pointed to a rounded black knob protruding from the soil a little off their path.,"Dane obeyed, only to have the blade jerk in his hand.","And when he loosened his hold in amazement, the steel slapped tight against the stone.","""Magnetic!""","""Yes.",Which might explain our crash.,"Also this.""",Jellico held out a field compass to demonstrate that its needle had gone completely mad.,"""We can use the mountain range itself for a guide,"" Dane said with more confidence than he felt.","""True enough.","But we may have trouble when we head west again.""",Jellico let the lenses swing free on their cord about his neck.,"""If we were wrecked on purpose""--his mouth tightened and the old blaster burn on his cheek stretched as did his jaw set--""then someone is going to answer a lot of questions--and fast!""","""The Chief Ranger, sir?""","""I don't know.","I just don't know!""",The captain grunted as he adjusted his pack and started on.,"If fortune had failed them earlier, she smiled on them now.","Asaki discovered a cave before sundown, located not too far from a mountain stream.","The Ranger sniffed the air before that dark opening as the Hunter pilot shed his equipment and crept forward on his hands and knees, his head up and his nostrils expanding as

wouldn't want to chance it, unless we are left with no other choice.",There is no way of telling how long the drug works.,"Frankly, right now I'm not even sure I could detect a hallucination for very long under these conditions,"" was Tau's discouraging verdict.","If any of them slept that night, they did so only in snatches.","The apprehension which had come with the previous night was back, intensified, and that lurking, indefinable fear rode them hard.",They were shaken out of their private terrors shortly after dawn.,"There were always sounds to be heard in the jungle: the cries of unseen birds, the crash of some tree eaten alive by parasitic sapping.","But what broke now was no bird call, no isolated tree falling.","A trumpeting roar, the crackling smash of vegetation, heralded a real menace.","Asaki spun to face northward, though there was nothing to be seen there except the unshaken wall of the jungle.","""Graz!","Graz on stampede!""",Nymani joined his superior.,Jellico arose swiftly and Dane read on the captain's face the seriousness of this.,The off-worlder turned to his own men with a sharp order.,"""On your feet!",We may have to move on the double.,"Up-mountain?""",he demanded of the Chief Ranger.,"The other was still listening, not only with his ears but with the whole of his tense body.","Three of the deer-like creatures they had hunted for food broke out of the green wall, fled past the men as if the latter was invisible.","And behind them, the hunted now and not the hunter, came a lion, its strikingly marked black-and-white hide dramatic in the light of the morning.",It showed fangs in a snarl and then was gone in one huge bound.,"More deer things, scurrying of other small creatures, moving too fast for clear identification, and behind them the fury of destruction which marked the headlong advance of Khatka's largest mammals slamming through the jungle.",They had started up-slope when Nymani cried out.,"A white bulk, hard to distinguish in that light against the gray of the earth, headed after them.","Dane had a fleeting glimpse of curled tusks, of an open mouth, raw-red and wide enough to engulf his whole head, of shaggy legs driving at an unbelievable pace.",Asaki snapped a beam from the needler.,The white monster roared and came on.,"They dived for the scant cover offered as the graz bull died, not two yards away from the Chief Ranger, its heavy body skidding along the earth with the force of its speed as it went down.","""That did it!""","Jellico sighted coolly with his blaster as a second bull, fighting mad, tore from the jungle and pounded at them.","Behind it a third tusked head thrust out of the brush, large eyes searched for an enemy.","Dane studied the dead bull, but the animal did not come to life this time.",These were not hallucinations.,"And the malignancy of the rock apes, the cunning of the native Khatkan lion, were pallid things compared to a graz herd on the rampage.",The second bull yelped with an almost canine complaint as Jellico's blaster caught it head-on.,"Blinded, the beast blundered ahead, climbing the mountain side.",The third met a ray from Nymani's needler.,But the Chief Ranger leaped from behind his sheltering rock to the one where the captain had taken refuge and pulled him into the open.,"""They must not corner us here!""",Jellico agreed to that.,"""Come on!""",he barked to Tau and Dane.,"They fled along a rough way, trying to gain altitude, but finding a rising cliff wall which could not be easily climbed.","Two more graz went down, one badly wounded, one safely dead.",Behind them more white heads came from the brush.,"What original cause had started the stampede the fugitives could not guess, but now the fear and anger of the animals were centering upon them.","And, in spite of their efforts, the party was being herded into a pocket between the jungle below, where the main body of graz crashed along, and a steep wall.","Given time to find the necessary finger and toe holds, a man might climb that wall, but they could not attempt it now.","The portion of ledge on which they ran, stopped to fire, and then ran on again, angled to the southeast.","And so they came to its end quickly, a drop ending in a plain of yellow-gray mud studded with clumps of bleached vegetation which led, like steppingstones, toward a tangle of matted, sickly looking plants and reeds.","""All right,"" Tau faced around, ""what do we do now?",Space lift?,"And using what for wings or jets?""","As if the graz could sense that they now had their victims safely cornered, what must have been a goodly segment of the herd hooked their way from the jungle and started up.","Puffing, digging in those sturdy legs which had to take the massive weight of their barrel-shaped bodies, they made their way determinedly up-grade.",One might almost believe that they had intelligently planned this end for their drive.,"""We go down!""","Asaki yelled, and used his needler on the leader of that climbing platoon.","""The brush islands,"" Nymani amended.","""I show you!""","He thrust his needler at Jellico and was over the edge of the ledge, hanging by his hands and swinging his weight back and forth like a pendulum.","At the up-swing of his body to the right, he let go and plunged out, landing half across one of the reed islets.","The Khatkan clawed his way to his knees, gained his feet, and leaped for the next bit of solid ground.","""You, Thorson!""","Jellico jerked his head at Dane and the younger spaceman holstered his fire ray, slipped gingerly over the drop and prepared to repeat Nymani's feat as best he could.","He was not quite as successful with his sidewise swing, landing with only his forearms across the islet, the rest of his body being swiftly embedded in what was ooze covered only with a thin crust of dried matter.","The stench of the stuff was sickening, but the fear of being entrapped in it gave him the necessary impetus to push forward, though what was meant to be a swift half-dive was more of a worm's progress.","He grabbed frantically at brittle stems, at coarse grass which cut like knives at his hands.",But some of the material held and he lay face down on a lump which did not give under his weight.,"There was no time to linger; he had to get to the next patch, to free this dubious landing place for the men embattled on the rise above.","Stumbling up, Dane judged the distance with a space-trained eye and jumped to a knob Nymani had already quitted.","The Khatkan was more than halfway along toward that promise of solid ground which the tangled mass of leprous vegetation led to, zigzagging expertly from islet to islet.",There was a crash and a roar behind.,Dane balanced on the third of the minute islands to look back.,"He saw the lash of blaster fire on the top of the cliff, Tau on his knees on the first of their chain of steppingstones, and a graz sprawled head and forequarters in the sucking muck where it had dived past the two defenders above.","Needler and blaster fired together again, and then Jellico swung over the cliff rim.","Tau waved vigorously and Dane took off for the next islet, just making it by lucky chance.","The rest of the journey he took in a rush, trying not to think of anything but the necessity of landing on some spot of firm ground.","His last leap of all was too short, so that he went knee deep in a particularly evil-smelling pool where yellow scum spattered his breeches and he experienced the insidious pull of the bottomless stuff.",A stout branch whipped across his shoulder and he caught it.,"With Nymani's wiry strength on the other end, Dane worked free and sat, white-faced and shivering, on a mat of brush, while the Khatkan hunter turned his attention to the safety of Tau, the next arrival.","More fortunate, or more skillful than Dane, the medic made the hop from the last tuft without mishap.",But he was blowing heavily as he collapsed beside the other spaceman.,Together they watched the progress of their captain.,"Safe on the second tussock from the shore, Jellico halted, edged carefully around and used the needler Nymani had left with him.",A shaggy head tossed and the bull fronting Asaki on the cliff went down.,"The Chief Ranger dodged quickly to the right and a second beast rushed out and over, to join its mired comrade in the swamp below.","As Jellico shot again, the Khatkan slung his needler and went over to gain the first islet.","One more graz was wounded but luckily it hunched about, turning its formidable tusks on those that followed, thus keeping the path clear for its enemies.","Jellico was making the journey, sure-footedly, with the Chief Ranger only one hillock behind.",Tau sighed.,"""Someday maybe this will be just another tall tale and we'll all be thought liars when we spout it,"" he observed.","""That is if we survive to tell it.",So now which way do we go?,"If I had my choice it would be up!""","When Dane pulled himself to his feet and surveyed their small refuge, he was ready to agree to that.","For the space, packed with dead and dying vegetable matter until one sank calf deep, was a triangle with a narrow point running east into the swamp.","""They don't give up easily, do they?""",Jellico looked back to the shore and the cliff.,"Though the wounded graz bull still held the heights against its fellows, there were others breaking from the jungle on the lower level, wandering back and forth to paw the earth, rip up soil with their tusks, and otherwise threaten anyone who would try to return to the strip they patrolled.","""They will not,"" Asaki answered bleakly.","""Arouse a graz and it will trail you for days; kill any of the herd and you have little hope of escaping them on foot.""",It would seem now that the swamp was a deterrent to pursuit.,The two beasts that had fallen in the mire moaned in a pitiful rising note.,"They had ceased to struggle and several of their kind clustered on the shore near them, calling entreatingly.",Asaki took careful aim with the needler and put one animal after another out of its misery.,But the flash of those shots angered those on shore to a higher pitch of rage.,"""No going back,"" he said.","""At least not for several days.""","Tau slapped a black, four-winged insect which had settled on his arm, its jaws wide open for a sampling bite.","""We can't very well perch here until they forget all about us,"" he pointed out.","""Not without water we can trust, and with the local wild life ready to test us for tasty eating.""","Nymani had prowled along the swampward point of their island, and now he made his report.","""There is more high land to the east.","Perhaps it will give us a bridge across.""",At that moment Dane doubted his ability to make any more leaps from island to island.,And it would seem Tau shared his discouragement.,"""I don't suppose you could discourage our friends on shore there with a few more shots?""",Asaki shook his head.,"""We do not have clips enough to settle a whole herd.","These might retreat from sight but they would be waiting for us in the bush, and that would mean certain death.","We shall have to take the swamp road.""","If Dane had considered their earlier march misery, this was sheer torture.","Since footing was never secure, falls were frequent, and within a quarter-hour they were all plastered with evil-smelling slime and mud which hardened to rock consistency when exposed to the air.","Painful as this was, it did protect a portion of their bodies from the insects with which the swamp was well stocked.","And, in spite of their efforts to find a way out, the only possible paths led them deeper into the center of the unexplored morass.",At last Asaki called a halt and a council to consider retreat.,To locate an island from which they could at least watch the shore appealed very strongly indeed.,"""We have to have water.""","Tau's voice was a harsh croak, issuing out of a mask of green mud festooned with trailing weeds.","""This ground is rising.""",Asaki smacked the stock of his needler against the surface on which he crouched.,"""I think perhaps there may be clean land soon to come.""","Jellico hitched his way up a sapling, now bending under his weight.",Through the vision lenses he studied the route ahead.,"""You're right about that,"" he called to the Chief Ranger.","""There's a showing of the right sort of green to the left, about half a mile on.","And,"" he glanced about at the westering sun, ""we have about an hour yet of good light in which to make it.","I wouldn't try such a run after dark.""",That promise of green bolstered their weary spirits for a last exhausting effort.,"Once again they were faced with a series of islet leaps, and now they carried with them brush culled from the bigger tussocks to aid in times of need.","When Dane scrambled up the last pull, staggered, and went down to his knees again, he knew he was done.","He did not even move at an excited cry from Nymani, echoed a moment later by Asaki.","It was not until the latter leaned over him, a canteen open in his hand, that Dane aroused a little.","""Drink!""",the Khatkan urged.,"""We have found a water tree.","This is fresh.""","The liquid might have been fresh, but it also had a peculiar taste, which Dane did not note until he had gulped down a generous swallow.",At that moment he was past caring about anything but the fact that he did have a portion of drinkable stuff in hand.,"Here the stunted, unnatural growth of the swamplands had given away to the more normal vegetation of the jungle-clad lowlands.","Had they come clear across the swamp, Dane wondered dully, or was this only a large island in the midst of the stinking boglands?",He drank again and regained strength enough to crawl to where his shipmates lay.,It was some time before he was interested in much besides the fact that he could drink when he wished.,"Then he watched Jellico waver to his feet, his head turned eastward.","Tau, too, sat up as if alerted by the _Queen's_ alarm buzzer.","The Khatkans were gone, perhaps back to the water tree.","But all three of the spacemen heard that sound, a far off throbbing rhythm which was a vibration as well.",Jellico looked to Tau.,"""Drums?""","""Could be.""",The medic screwed the cap back on his canteen.,"""I'd say we have company--only I'd like to know what kind!""","They might have been mistaken about the drums, but none of them could have been mistaken about the bolt which came out of nowhere to slice through a tree trunk as a knife might slash wet clay.",Blaster--and a particular type of blaster!,"""Patrol issue!""","Tau lay flat, squeezing himself against the earth as if he wished he could ooze into it.","Jellico wriggled toward the bush in answer to a low call from Asaki, and the others made a worm's progress in his wake.",Under cover they found the Chief Ranger readying his needler.,"""Poacher camp here,"" he explained bleakly.","""And they know about us.""","""A perfect end to a stinking day,"" remarked Tau dispassionately.","""We might have guessed something of this sort was waiting.""",He tried to rub away some of the dried clay coating his chin.,"""But do poachers use drums?""",The Chief Ranger scowled.,"""That is what Nymani has gone to find out.""",VII Darkness closed in while they waited for Nymani's return.,There had been no further attack from the blaster wielder; perhaps he was only trying to pin them down where they were.,"Out over the swamp, weird patches of phosphorescence moved in small ghostly clouds, and bright dots of insects with their own built-in lighting systems flashed spark-fashion or sailed serenely on regular flight plans.",At night the wonder of the place was far removed from the squalid reality of the day.,"They chewed on their rations, drank sparingly of the water, and tried to keep alert to any sight or sound.","That monotonous undertone, which might or might not be drums, continued as a basic hum to the noises of the night, drowned out at intervals by a splash, a mutter or cry from some swamp creature.","Beside Dane, Jellico stiffened, moved his blaster, as someone wriggled through the brush, trilling softly.","""Off-worlders,"" Nymani reported in gasps to Asaki, ""and outlaws, too.","They make a hunting sing--tomorrow they march for a killing.""",Asaki rested his chin on his broad forearm.,"""Outlaws?""","""They show no lord's badge.","But each I saw wears a bracelet of three, five, or ten tails.","They are Trackers indeed, and Hunters of the best!""","""They have huts?""","""Not so.","There are no dwellers in the inners courts here.""",Out of habit Nymani used the polite term for the women of his race.,"""I would say they tarry only for the space of a hunt.","And on the boots of one I saw salt crust.""","""Salt crust!""",Asaki snapped and half arose.,"""So that is the type of lure they use.","There must be a saline mire near here to pull game--"" ""How many off-worlders?""",Jellico broke in.,"""Three who are Hunters, one who is different.""","""How different?""",questioned Asaki.,"""He wears upon his body garments which are strange; on his head a round covering such as we see upon the off-worlders of the ships--"" ""A spaceman!""",Asaki laughed harshly.,"""Why not?","They must have some method of transporting their hides.""","""You can't tell me,"" Jellico returned, ""that anyone is able to set a ship down in this muck.","It would simply be buried for all time.""","""But, Captain, what type of a spaceport does a Free Trader need?","Do you not planet your own ship on worlds where there are no waiting cradles, no fitter shops, none of the conveniences such as mark the field Combine maintains on Xecho?""","""Of course I do.","But one does need a reasonably smooth stretch of territory, open enough so the tail flames won't start a forest fire.","You don't ever ride a tail push down in a swamp!""","""Which testifies to a trail out of here, fairly well-traveled, and some kind of a usable landing space not too far away,"" Asaki replied.","""And that could very well serve us.""","""But they know we are here,"" Tau pointed out.",It was Nymani's turn to laugh.,"""Man from the stars, there is no trail so well-hidden that a Ranger of the preserves cannot nose it out, nor any Hunter--be he a two or five bracelet veteran--who can keep pinned down a determined man of the forest service!""",Dane lost interest in the argument at that moment.,"He was at the edge of their line, the nearest to the swamp, and he had been watching patches of ghostly light flitting above the rank water-weeds.",For the past few moments those wisps of faded radiance had been gathering into a growing anthropomorphic blot hanging over the morass several yards away.,And the misty outlines were now assuming more concrete shape.,"He watched, unable to believe in what he was seeing.","At first the general outline, non-defined as it was, made him think of a rock ape.","But there were no pointed ears above the round skull, no snout on the visage turned in profile toward him.",More and more patches of swamp luminescence were drawn to that glowing figure.,"What balanced there now, as if walking the treacherous surface of the swampland, was no animal.","It was a man, or the semblance of one, a small, thin man--a man he had seen once before, on the terrace of Asaki's mountain fortress.","The thing stood almost complete, its head cocked in what was an attitude of listening.","""Lumbrilo!""","Dane identified it, still knowing that the witch doctor could not be standing there listening for them.","But, to shake him still farther, the head turned at his cry.","Only there were no eyes, no features on the white expanse which should have been a face.","And somehow that made the monster more menacing, convincing Dane against sane logic that the thing _was_ spying on them.","""Demon!""","That was Nymani; and over his sudden quaver, robbed of all the confidence which had been there only moments earlier, came Asaki's demand: ""What stands there, Medic?","Tell us that!""","""A whip to drive us out of hiding, sir.",As you know as well as I.,"If Nymani spied upon them, then they have spied upon us in turn.","And this, I think, also answers another question.","If there is a canker of trouble on Khatka, then Lumbrilo is close to its root.""","""Nymani!""",The Chief Ranger's voice was the crack of a lash.,"""Will you forget again that you are a man, and run crying for shelter against a shaft of light?","As this off-world Medic says, Lumbrilo fashions such as that to drive us into our enemies' hands!""","The shadow thing in the swamp moved, putting its foot forward on surface which would not bear the weight of a human body, taking a deliberate step and then another, heading for the concealing brush where the fugitives lay.","""Can you get rid of it, Tau?""",Jellico asked in his usual crisp voice.,He might have been inquiring about some problem aboard the _Queen_.,"""I'd rather get at the source.""",There was a grim note in the Medic's reply.,"""And to do that I want to look at their camp.""","""Well enough!""",Asaki crept back in the brush.,"The ghost of that which was not a man had reached the shore of the island, stood there, its blank head turned toward them.","Weird as it was, now that the first shock of sighting it was over, the spacemen could accept and dismiss it as they had not been so able to dismiss the phantom rock ape.","""If that thing was sent to drive us,"" Dane ventured, ""wouldn't we be playing their game by going inland now?""",The Chief Ranger did not pause in his crawl to the left.,"""I think not.",They do not expect us to arrive with our wits about us.,Panic-stricken men are easy to pull down.,This time Lumbrilo has overreached himself.,"Had he not played that game with the rock ape, he might have been able to stampede us now.""","Though the white thing continued to move inland, it did not change course to fall in behind them on the new route.","Whatever it was, it did not possess a mind.","There was a rustling, faint but distinguishable.",Then Dane caught Nymani's whisper.,"""The one left to watch the inland trail does so no longer.",We need not fear an alarm from _him_.,"Also, here is another blaster for our use.""","Away from the open by the swamp, the gloom was deeper.",Dane was guided only by the noises of the less-experienced Jellico and Tau made in their progress.,"They edged down into a small cut, floored with reeds and mud, where some of the moisture from the soggy land about them gathered into a half pool.",Straight through this swale the Khatkans set course.,The drum beat grew louder.,Now there was a glow against the dark--fire ahead?,Dane squirmed forward and at last gained a vantage point from which to survey the poachers' camp.,"There were shelters erected there, three of them, but they were mainly roofs of leaves and branches.","In two of them were stored bales of hides sewn into plastic cloth, ready to ship.",Before the third hut lounged four off-worlders.,And Nymani was very right; one of them wore ship's uniform.,"To the right of the fire was a ring of natives and another man, slightly apart, who beat the drum.",But of the witch doctor there was no sign.,"And Dane, thinking of that mist-born thing at the swamp's edge, shivered.",He could believe Tau's explanation of the drug which produced hallucinations back on the mountain side.,But how that likeness fashioned of phosphorescence had been sent by an absent man to hunt his enemies was a eerie puzzle.,"""Lumbrilo is not here.""",Nymani's thoughts must have been moving along the same path.,Dane could hear movements in the dark beside him.,"""There's a long-distance com unit in that third hut,"" Tau observed.","""So I see,"" Jellico snapped.","""Could you reach your men over the mountain with that, sir?""","""I do not know.","But if Lumbrilo is not here, how can he make his image walk the night?""",the Chief Ranger demanded impatiently.,"""We shall see.","If Lumbrilo is not here--he shall come.""",And the promise in Tau's tone was sure.,"""Those off-worlders will have to be out of action first.","And with that walking thing sent to drive us in, they must be waiting for us.""","""If they have sentries out, I will silence them!""",promised Nymani.,"""You have a plan?""",Asaki's wide shoulders and upheld head showed for an instant against the light from the camp.,"""You want Lumbrilo,"" Tau replied.","""Very well, sir, I believe I can give him to you, and in the doing discredit him with your Khatkans.","But not with the off-worlders free to move.""","The program was not going to be easy, Dane decided.","Every one of the poachers was armed with a Patrol blaster of the latest type, and a small part of his mind speculated as to what would be the result of that information conveyed to official quarters.",Free Traders and Patrolmen did not always see eye-to-eye over the proper action to be taken on the galactic frontier.,The _Queen's_ crew had had one such brush with authority in the immediate past.,"But each realized that the other had an important role in the general scheme of things, and if it came to a clash between the law and outlaws, Free Traders fought beside the Patrol.","""Why not give them what they expect--with reservations?""",inquired Jellico.,"""They've set us up to be stampeded into camp, flying ahead of that tame ghost of theirs.",Suppose we do stampede--after Nymani has removed any sentries--stampede so well we sweep right over them?,"I want to get at that com unit.""","""You don't think they'll just mow us down as we come in?""","""You delivered a blow to Lumbrilo's pride; he won't be satisfied with just your burning,"" the captain answered Tau, ""not if I'm any judge of character.",And we'd furnish hostages of a sort--especially the Chief Ranger.,"No, if they had wanted to kill us they would have shot us off those islands when we came here.","There would have been no playing around with ghosts and goblins.""","""There is reason in your words.","And it is true they would like to have me, those outlaws down there,"" Asaki commented.","""I am of the Magawaya and we have pressed always for stronger security methods to be used against such as they.","But I do not see how we can take the camp.""","""We won't go in from the front--as they expect us to do.","But a try from the north, getting at the off-worlders first.... Three men causing enough disturbance to cover operations of the other two...."" ""So?""",There was a moment of silence as the Chief Ranger evaluated that.,Then he added a few comments of his own.,"""That off-worlder who wears spaceman's clothing, his weapon is not drawn, though the others are ready.",But I believe that you are right in thinking they expect to be warned by sentries.,Those we can see to.,"Suppose then, Captain, you and I play the fear-crazed men running from demons.","Nymani will cover us from the dark and your two men--"" Tau spoke up, ""Give me leave to flush out our other quarry, sir.",I believe I can keep him occupied.,"Dane, you'll take the drum.""","""Drum?""","With his mind on blasters, it was startling to be offered a noise-maker.","""It's your business to get that drum.",And when you get it I want you to beat out 'Terra Bound.',"You certainly can play that, can't you?""","""I don't understand,"" Dane began and then swallowed the rest of his protest, knowing that Tau was not going to explain why he needed to have the hackneyed popular song of the spaceways played in a Khatkan swamp.","As a Free Trader he had had quite a few odd jobs handed him during the past couple of years, but this was the first time he had been ordered to serve as a musician.",They waited for Nymani through dragging minutes.,Surely those in the camp would expect their arrival soon now?,Dane's fire ray was in his hand as he measured the distance to the drummer's stand.,"""It is done,"" Nymani whispered from the darkness behind them.",Jellico and the Chief Ranger moved to the left; Tau crept to the right and Dane pushed level with the medic.,"""When they move,"" Tau's lips were beside his ear, ""jump for that drum.","I don't care how you get it, but get it and keep it!""","""Yes, sir!""","There was a wailing cry from the north, a howl of witless fear.","The singers stopped in mid-note, the drummer paused, his hand uplifted.",Dane darted forward in a plunge which carried him to that man.,"The Khatkan did not have time to rise from his knees as the barrel of the fire rod struck his head, sending him spinning.","Then the drum was cradled in the spaceman's arm, close to his chest, his weapon aimed across it at the startled natives.","The crackle of blaster fire, the shrill whine of needlers in action, raised a bedlam from the other end of the camp.","Backing up a little, Dane went down on one knee, his weapon ready to sweep over the bewildered natives, the drum resting on the earth against his body.","Keeping the fire rod steady, his left hand went to work, not in the muted cadence the Khatkan drummer had chosen, but in hard and vigorous thumps which rolled across the clamor of the fight.","There was no forgetting the beat of ""Terra Bound"" and he delivered it with force, so that the familiar da-dah-da-da droned loud enough to awaken the whole camp.",Dane's move appeared to completely baffle the Khatkan outlaws.,"They stared at him, the whites of their eyes doubly noticeable in their dark faces, their mouths a little agape.",As usual the unexpected had driven them off guard.,He dared not look away from that gathering to see how the fight at the other end of the camp was progressing.,But he did see Tau's advance.,"The medic came into the light of the fire, not with his ordinary loose-limbed spaceman's stride, but mincingly, with a dancing step, and he was singing to the drum beat of ""Terra Bound.""","Dane could not understand the words, but he knew that they patterned in and out of the drum beats, weaving a net between singer and listeners as Lumbrilo had woven his net on the mountain terrace.",Tau had them!,"Had every one of the native outlaws ensnared, so that Dane rested his weapon across his knee and took up the lower beat with the fingers of his right hand as well.",_Da-dah-da-da_....,"The innocuous repetitive refrain of the original song which had been repeating itself in his mind faded, and somehow he caught the menace in the new words Tau was mouthing.",Twice the medic shuffled about a circle of his own making.,"Then he stooped, took a hunting knife from the belt of the nearest Khatkan and held it point out toward the dark east.","Dane would not have believed the medic knew the drill he now displayed, for with no opponent save the dancing firelight he fought a knife duel, feinting, striking, twisting, retreating, attacking, all in time to the beat of the drum Dane was no longer conscious of playing.",And as he strove it was very easy to picture another fighting against him.,"So that when the knife came up in a vicious thrust which was the finish of his last attack, Dane stared stupidly at the ground, half expecting to see a body lying there.",Once more Tau ceremoniously saluted with his blade to the east.,Then he laid it on the ground and stood astride its gleaming length.,"""Lumbrilo!""",His confident voice arose above the call of the drum.,"""Lumbrilo--I am waiting.""","VIII Vaguely aware that the clamor at the other end of the camp had died away, Dane muted the sound of his drum.",Over its round top he could watch the Khatkan outlaws; their heads bobbed and swayed in time to the beat of his fingers.,"He, too, could feel the pull of Tau's voice.",But what would come in answer?,That shadowy thing which had been loosed to drive them here?,Or the man himself?,"To Dane, the ruddy light of the fire dimmed, yet there was no actual dying of those flames which coiled and thrust around the wood.",And the acrid scent of burning was thick.,"How much of what followed was real, how much the product of his tense nerves, Dane was never afterwards able to tell.","In fact, whether all the witnesses there saw the same sights could be questioned.","Did each man, Khatkan and off-worlder, see only what his particular set of emotions and memories dictated?","Something swept in from the east, something which was not as tangible as the creature born of swamp mist.","Rather it came as an unseen menace to the fire, and all that fire signifies to human kind--security, comradeship, a weapon against the age-old forces of the dangerous night.","Was that threat, too, only in their minds?",Or had Lumbrilo some power to so shape his hatred?,"The unseen was cold; it sapped a man's strength, bit at his brain, weighted his hands and feet, weakened him.",It strove to soften him into clay another could remold.,"Nothingness, darkness, all that was opposed to life and warmth and reality, arose in the night, gathered together against them.","Yet still Tau fronted that invisible wave, his head high.",And between his sturdily planted feet the knife gleamed bright with a radiance of its own.,"""Ahhh--"" Tau's voice curled out, to pierce that creeping menace.","Then he was singing again, the cadence of his unknown words rising a little above the pattern wrought by the drum.","Dane forced his heavy hands to continue the beat, his wrists to rise and fall in defiance of that which crept to eat their strength and make them less then men.","""Lumbrilo!","I, Tau, of another star, another sky, another world, bid you come forth and range your power against mine!""","Now there was a sharper note in that demand, the snap of an order.","He was answered by another wave of the black negation--stronger, rolling up to smash them down, as a wave in the heavy surf of a wild ocean pounds its force against the beach.",This time Dane thought he could see that dark mass.,"He tore his eyes away before it took on substance, concentrating on the movements of his hands against the drum head, refusing to believe that hammer of power was rising to flatten them all.",He had heard Tau describe such things in the past.,"But told in familiar quarters on board the _Queen_, such experiences were only stories.",Here was danger unleashed.,Yet the medic stood unbowed as the wave broke upon him in full.,"And, advancing under the crest of that lick of destruction, came its controller.","This was no ghost drawn from the materials of the swamp; this was a man, walking quietly, his hands as empty as Tau's, yet grasping weapons none of them could see.","In the firelight, as the wave receded sullenly, men moaned, lay face down upon the ground, beat their hands feebly against the earth.","But, as Lumbrilo came on from the shadows, one of them got to his hands and knees, moving with small tortured jerks.","He crawled toward Tau, his head lolling on his shoulders as the head of the dead rock ape had done.","Dane patted the drum with one hand while, with the other, he groped for his fire ray.",He tried to shout in warning and found that he could not utter a sound.,"Tau's arm moved, raised from his side, made a circling motion.","The creeping man, his eyes rolled up in his head until only the whites gleamed blindly in the limited light, followed that gesture.","He drew level with the medic, passed beyond toward Lumbrilo, whining as a hound prevented from obeying his master might lament.","""So be it, Lumbrilo,"" Tau said.","""This is between you and me.",Or do you not dare to risk your power against mine?,"Is Lumbrilo so weak a one that he must send another to do his will?""","Raising both hands again the medic brought them down, curling inward, until he stooped and touched them to the ground."
