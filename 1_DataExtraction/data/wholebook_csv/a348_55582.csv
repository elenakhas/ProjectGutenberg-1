and this made him feel all the more furious.","In the evening Senka Tschischik, the herald of misfortune to the inhabitants of the court, was able to report another battle having been fought at the Orloffs'.","When Grischka had beaten his wife black and blue, he disappeared sometimes for the whole night, not even coming back to the house for Sunday.","Finally he would return, dirty, and with bloodshot eyes, to his home.","Matrona would receive him in silence, wearing a severe expression, but full of secret pity.","She knew that under these circumstances he would like nothing better than a drop of spirits, and already had a bottle of vodka prepared for him.","""Come, pour me out a glass!""","he cried in a hoarse voice, and after swallowing two, he would sit down to work.","The whole of that day he would be troubled with pricks of conscience, which often became so severe and painful that he could not bear himself.","He would throw down his work, and uttering wild words of self-reproach would pace up and down the room, or would throw himself on the bed.","Motrja would give him time to get over this attack of remorse, and then they would make it up again.","At first these reconciliations were full of much that was tender and sweet, but after a time this delight disappeared entirely, and they simply made it up, because it was impossible to remain a whole week--that is to say, till the following Saturday--without speaking to each other.","""Are you going to destroy yourself, then, altogether with that vodka?""",sighed Motrja.,"""It's possible,"" replied Grischka, spitting on one side, with the look of a man to whom it was quite immaterial whether he destroyed himself or not ""And you will end by running away from me?...""","he continued generally, exaggerating the picture of the future, and looking searchingly into her eyes.",For some time past she had cast down her eyes whenever he had spoken in this way; though at first she had never done so.,"Grischka, when he noticed this, frowned threateningly, and ground his teeth ominously.","As a matter of fact Matrona was just now doing her very best to win back his heart She visited the fortune-teller's and wise women, and brought back with her all sorts of charms and spells in order to gain this object When none of these had any effect she paid for a mass in honour of the martyr St Boniface, the patron saint against drunkenness; during the whole mass she knelt in a dark corner of the church crying bitterly, whilst her trembling lips moved in wordless prayer.","But ever more and more often her soul became possessed with a cold feeling of hatred against Grischka, which awoke within her dark thoughts.","She felt ever less and less pity towards this man, who three years ago, with his joyful laugh and his loving words, had given to her whole life such full delight and pleasure....","Thus lived, from one day's end to another, these two children of men, who at heart were neither of them evilly disposed;

""you might empty the slop-pail a little more often, for it is from that this horrible smell comes.","I should like to advise you, my good woman, to wash it out more often, and to place chloride of lime in the corners of the room.","That will purify the air, and it's a very good remedy against the damp.","And you, my fine fellow--why do you look so upset?""","He turned towards Orloff, seized his hand suddenly, and felt his pulse.",The quick assured manner of the medical student impressed the Orloffs to such a degree that they seemed at first to be struck dumb.,"Matrona smiled constrainedly and watched him in silence, whilst Grigori seemed as if refreshed by the sight of the open fair young face.","""Well, and how are your stomachs feeling?""","asked the medical student ""You can speak out openly to me without any fuss--it's a question you see of life and death....","If anything is not quite right we will treat you gratis with some simple citrate medicine or something of that sort, and you will be all right in a few days.""","""We can't complain;

the whiteness of the wall reflected this light, causing it to fall straight across the cellar and sparkle on the glass sugar-basin standing in front of Matrona.",She watched with wrinkled brow this glimmer of light till her eyes grew tired.,"Then she rose, put the tea-things away, and lay down on the bed; she was feeling anxious and heavy-hearted.",When Grigori returned it was already dark.,She could tell by the way he walked that he was in a good temper.,"He did not swear at the darkness of the room, but called Matrona by her name, and then went up to the bed and sat down on it Matrona raised herself and sat by his side.","""Guess what's the latest news!""","began Orloff, smiling.","""Well, what is it?""","""You are going to take a situation also.""","""Where?""",she asked with stammering lips.,"""In the same Infirmary as I shall be in,"" he explained in an impressive tone of voice.","She fell on his neck, pressed him closely to her breast, and kissed his lips.",He did not expect this and pushed her away.,"""She is only pretending,"" he said to himself.","""The cunning creature, she does not really want to be with me!","She thinks me a fool, the little serpent!""","""Well, why are you so pleased about it?""",he asked in a rough voice that was hill of distrust He would have liked to have pushed her off the bed.,"""I am only so pleased,"" she said, smiling happily.","""Don't try and humbug me;

whilst they became confused with all the different impressions that poured in upon them.","And though they had the firm intention of making themselves useful, running hither and thither full of zeal, they succeeded nevertheless in doing very little work, and too often got into the way of other people.","Grigori felt more than once that he had indeed deserved a reproof for his clumsiness, but to his astonishment no one took it upon them to reprove him.","One of the doctors, a tall dark man with a black moustache and a hooked nose, with an enormous wart over his right eyebrow, told Grigori to help one of the patients into the bath-room; the new attendant, eager to be useful, seized hold of the patient with such a show of zeal that he called out and groaned.","""Take care, my man!","Don't break him in two!""",said the doctor quite seriously.,"""We've got to get him into the bath-room whole....",These words confused Orloff.,"The patient, however, a long thin fellow, smiled constrainedly, and said in a hollow voice--"" He doesn't understand yet ... he's a new hand....","The head doctor, an old gentleman with a pointed grey beard and great flashing eyes, had told the Orloffs when they first came into the Infirmary how they should manage the patients, and what they had to do under certain circumstances.","At the end of his instructions he asked them if they had taken a bath lately, and then gave them out white aprons.","The voice of this old gentleman had in it something pleasing and sympathetic, and the Orloffs felt they should like him.",But half-an-hour afterwards they had forgotten all his instructions in the noisy rush of work in the Infirmary.,"People in white clothes ran up against them; commands which were carried out with lightning speed by the attendants, sounded in their ears; the patients groaned, sobbed and sighed; water flowed splashing and hissing from the taps; and this blending of sounds seemed to fill the air, which was already saturated with sharp unpleasant smells that irritated the nose; and it seemed to Orloff that every word of the doctors, every sigh of the patients, was impregnated with the same smell.","At first all this appeared to him like a wild chaos, in which he could never feel at home, but which worked on him increasingly in a depressing, bewildering way.",But after a few hours he was seized by the strong current of energy which flowed through everything.,"He pricked up his ears, and felt a burning desire to get into the swim, and learn how to do all these things that others were doing; joined with the feeling that he would be lighter-hearted and happier if he could be swept away in this whirlpool.","""Corrosive sublimate!""",shouted one of the doctors.,"""Some more hot water in the bath over there!""",a thin little student with red eyes ordered.,"""Look here!","What's your name?""","""Orloff.""","""All right!...","Just rub this patient's feet ... yes, that's right ... so....",I see you understand at once....,So--o ... not so hard!,"or you will rub his skin off!...""","""Oh!","how tired I am!""","exclaimed another student, long-haired and pock-marked, whilst he was giving Orloff the necessary instructions.","""They have brought in another patient!""",some one exclaimed.,"""Orloff, just go and see!...","Help them to bring him in.""","Grigori, full of zeal, followed out all the directions.","He was covered with perspiration, there was a ringing in his ears, and a mist swam before his eyes.",At times the consciousness of himself disappeared entirely under the mass of impressions which crowded in upon him at every moment.,"The dark-green rings round the glassy eyes of the patients, their leaden-coloured faces, their bones, which stood out from their bodies, their clammy, bad-smelling skins, the horrible convulsions of the half-dead bodies, all this oppressed his heart painfully, and produced a nausea which he had never experienced before.","Once or twice he had caught a hurried glimpse of his wife in the corridor of the Infirmary; she seemed in these few hours to have grown thinner, and her white face wore a troubled look.","""Well, how are you getting on?""",he asked during one of these hurried encounters.,"She could only answer with a smile, and disappeared immediately.","A thought struck Grischka, which he however kept to himself; was it really so necessary for him to have brought his wife with him into this hell?",She might catch the infection and die....,"The second time he met her he called out to her in a loud voice-- ""Be sure and keep yourself clean; wash your hands very often, and take every care!""","""Why do you say all that?","What if I don't take care?""","she asked, showing her little white teeth; and it seemed to him as if she were defying him.",Her reply made him angry.,"""There she is,"" he thought, ""joking even in such a place as this!","What a parcel of fools these women-folk are!""",He found however no further opportunity to give her recommendations.,"Matrona, having noticed the angry look on his face, hurried away to the women's side of the building.",A minute later Grigori was helping to carry into the mortuary the body of a policeman who had been well known to him.,"Only two days before he had seen the policeman at his post, and had sworn at him as he had passed by; they had never been on good terms together.","And now he saw this man, such a short time before so strong and healthy, lying dead, and quite disfigured with convulsions.","The corpse swayed backwards and forwards against the bearers, and stared with wide-open glassy eyes.",Orloff realized the whole force and cruelty of the contrast.,"""Why does one ever come into the world?""","he thought to himself, ""if such a horrible complaint as this can knock one over in four-and-twenty hours?""","He glanced at the bier, and felt a movement of pity for the dead policeman.",What would become now of the three children of the dead man?,"Last year he lost his wife, and there had scarcely been time for him to marry again ... now the poor little creatures would be left orphans entirely....",This thought filled him with a feeling of real pain.,"Suddenly the left arm of the corpse began to stretch out and to straighten itself, and at the same time the mouth of the dead man, which till then had stood open, and drawn down on the left side, closed itself.","""Stop a moment,"" said Orloff to the other bearer; and he rested the bier on the ground.","""He is still alive!""",he whispered in a terrified voice.,"The bearer, who had been helping him to carry the stretcher, turned round, looked at the corpse attentively, and then said angrily to Orloff-- ""What nonsense you are talking!",Don't you understand that he is getting himself ready for his coffin?,Don't you see how the cholera has twisted him up?...,He can't lie in the coffin in that position!...,Come!,"Let's get on again!""","""But just look; he is still moving!""","protested Orloff, trembling with horror.","""Hurry up now!","Catch hold, you fool!...","Don't you understand what I say, then?...",He _has_ to move in order to relax his limbs!,Are you then such an ignorant and stupid chap?...,_He_ alive?...,How can any one say that about a corpse?,"That's mutiny, brother!...","All our corpses here move, but I should advise you to be quiet about it Don't tell a soul that he has moved!","Otherwise one will tell his neighbour, and his neighbour will add a little bit on to the story, and we shall soon have a regular row up at the Infirmary, because they will be saying we bury them alive!",The whole mob would come here and pull everything to pieces.... And you would get your share of the knocks!...,Do you understand?,".... We will put him down there to the left.""","The quiet voice of Pronim--that was the name of the other attendant--and his soft way of speaking, calmed and reassured Grigori.","""Just keep a level head, brother!",You will soon get used to it all.,There is no harm going on here....,"The feeding, and the management, and everything are first-class.... We have all to die some day, every one recognizes that But till that time comes, keep, as I have said, a level head!...","Will you have a glass of schnapps?""","""Why not?""",replied Orloff.,"""I have got a drop in the corner there, ready for use on these sort of occasions.","What do you say; shall we have a go at it?""","They went off accordingly towards a quiet corner of the Infirmary, and pulled themselves together with a small glass of spirits.","Then Pronim dropped some essence of peppermint on to a piece of sugar, and handed it to Orloff.","""Take it; otherwise they will smell that we have been drinking.","They are very particular here about vodka; they say it is bad for one.""","""And you?...","have you got accustomed to the life here?""",asked Grigori.,"""I should think so!",I was one of the first to come.,Hundreds have died before my eyes.,"One lives here indeed in a state of uncertainty, but otherwise, to tell the truth, it's not bad ... it is God's work,--just like the Red Cross in war.","Have you heard of the Red Cross ambulance work, and of the nurses and sisters?",I saw them in the Turkish war.... And I was also at Ardahan and at Kars.,"They were indeed a brave lot, those ambulance people I Full of kind-heartedness and courage.",We soldiers had at least our guns and cannons; but they went about among the bullets as if they had been walking about in some pleasant garden.,"And when they found either one of us or a Turk--they brought them all to the place where the doctors were dressing the wounds, and stood near, whilst all around them the bullets were flying ...",sch!...,sch!...,Tju!...,Fit!...,"Often some poor chap would be hit by a ball just at the back of the neck,--ping!...","and there he would lie...."" This conversation, added to the drop of vodka which he held drunk, put Orloff into a more cheerful frame of mind.","""If I were to tell A, then I should also have to tell B,"" he consoled himself with thinking, whilst he rubbed the feet of a patient.","""As the ale is drawn, so it must be drunk.""","Behind him some one was begging in a plaintive voice--""Give me water!...","Give me something to drink ... for the love of...."" Another one called out, his teeth chattering with cold--""Oh!...",Och!...,Hohoho!...,hotter still!...,"It does me good, doctor!",Christ will reward you!...,"Give me some more hot water...."" ""Just pass the wine over here!""",called out Doctor Wasschtschenko.,"Orloff listened, full of interest, whilst he did his own work, to all that went on around him, and it began to dawn upon him that it was not all so meaningless and chaotic as it appeared to him at first This was no chaos reigning here, but powerful, conscious, active strength.","It was only when he thought of the police-officer, that a cold terror took possession of him, and he threw a scared glance out of the window towards the mortuary where the dead man lay.","He really did believe at heart that the police-officer was dead, but at times horrid doubts shot through his mind.",Suppose the dead man were to suddenly jump up and shout!,"And he remembered how some one had told him once that those who had died of the cholera broke out of their coffins, and, so it was said, ran about alter each other.","As he went backwards and forwards at his work, rubbing the limbs of one patient, helping another into a bath, everything seemed to be seething and turning round in his brain.",He thought of Matrona; what was she perhaps doing at this same moment?,"Sometimes he felt a fleeting wish to see her at once, if only for a minute.","But immediately this was succeeded by another thought; ""After all, she's all right here!...",It's good for her to have to move about; the fat little lump....,"It won't hurt her to get a bit thinner ... perhaps then she won't be so stupid...."" He could not get rid of the thought that Matrona was nourishing hidden desires in her breast, which were not flattering to his own manly vanity.","He went to the length of acknowledging to himself that she certainly had every right to be discontented with her past life, and it was possible she might long for some sort of change.","The fact of his acknowledging this much to himself was the cause of his mistaking his doubts as to her loyalty for the truth; and as a result of his jealousy he asked himself the question--""Why did I want to leave my cellar, and get into this kettle of hot water?""",...,"But all these, and other thoughts, stirred and whirled deep down at the bottom of his soul, they had no influence on his work, and they were driven into the background by the ceaseless attention which he bestowed on all that went on in the Infirmary.","He had never in his life seen men work as did these doctors and medical students, and more than once he thought, as he looked into their drawn faces, that they indeed more than earned their salaries.","As soon as Orloff was off duty he went, though he could hardly keep on his legs, into the courtyard of the Infirmary, and lay down close to the wall, under the window of the dispensary.","His thoughts seemed all scattered; near his heart he felt a dull, throbbing pain, and his legs were heavy with fatigue.","He seemed to have no more strength left either for thought or desire, but stretched himself out at once on the turf, and stared up towards the sky, which was filled with the many-coloured cloud-glories of the setting sun.","He dropped asleep at once, half-dead with fatigue.","He dreamt that he and his wife were the guests of Doctor Wasschtschenko--in a great room, around which stood elegant Viennese chairs.",On these chairs sat all the patients from the Infirmary.,"In the middle of the room the doctor began to dance the Russian national dance with Matrona, whilst Grischka himself played on the accordion and laughed light-heartedly, for the doctor's long legs were quite stiff at the joints, and he stepped in a dignified way like a heron on a bog, by the side of Matrona.","And the patients sitting round all laughed also, and swayed uncertainly on their chairs.",Suddenly there appeared at the door the police-officer.,"""Aha!""",he cried out in a gloomy threatening voice.,"""You thought I was dead already, brother Grischka!",Here you are playing on the accordion ... but you sent _me_ into the mortuary....,"So now then, get up with you, and come and follow me!""","Trembling in his whole body, and covered with perspiration, Orloff awoke, and scrambled up from the ground, whilst Doctor Wasschtschenko stood watching him reproachfully, and remarked-- ""Just listen to what I've got to say to you, my friend; if you want to go to sleep you have your own bunk there in the Infirmary!",Haven't they shown you where it is?,"What sort of an attendant do you call yourself, if you go and lie here on the ground with nothing over your body?...","If you get an inward chill, and knock up and die (which God forbid), what's going to happen then?","That's not the way to behave, my friend.... Why you're shivering now ... come along with me, and I will give you something for that....""

He felt pity for her, and would have liked to have prepared an agreeable surprise for her, perhaps to have bought some cakes or something of that sort to eat with their tea.","But whilst he was washing he put these thoughts away.... ""Why should he spoil his wife?...","She could get on very well without it!""","They drank their tea in a small bright room, the two windows of which looked out on to the open fields.",The gilded rays of the morning sun lay on the floor.,Dew still sparkled on the grass under the window.,Along the distant horizon could be just seen through a light opal morning mist the trees that bordered the high-road.,"The sky was cloudless, and a fresh smell of grass and of damp earth was waited in at the open windows.","The table stood just between the two windows, and three people sat down to it; Grigori, Matrona, and a companion of the latter, a tall, thin, middle-aged person, with a pock-marked face and good-tempered grey eyes.","She was called Felizata Jegorovna, and she was a spinster and the daughter of a college superintendent She could not drink the tea provided by the Infirmary, and so used her own samovar.","All this she told Orloff in an excited cracked voice; she invited him hospitably to take a seat near the window, and to refresh himself with the ""magnificent air of Heaven,"" whilst she disappeared somewhere for a time.","""Well, were you very tired yesterday?""",Orloff asked his wife.,"""I should rather think so,"" Matrona replied in a lively tone of voice.","""I could scarcely feel my legs under me, and my head was swimming.","I moved about at last as if I were half dead, and could scarcely hold on till I was released from duty....","I was praying all the time to the Lord that He would be merciful to us.""","""How is it, then?","Don't you feel afraid here?""","""What, of the sick people?""","""Of the sick people ... or of anything else....""

it was only necessary for them to show him by signs what had to be done.,"He was chatty and pleasant, and knew how to divert the attention of the patients, and this pleased increasingly the doctors and students.","All the impressions which in his new occupation pressed in upon him, worked together to elevate his feelings, and to increase his own self-respect.","He felt within himself a lively desire to do something great, so that the attention of all should be directed to him, and that every one should be astonished.","It seemed almost as if he had now for the first time become conscious that he was a human being, and as if he felt the need to prove this to himself and others by some heroic deed.","Filled with this unaccustomed ambition, Orloff undertook various venturesome deeds, in the hopes of distinguishing himself in the eyes of onlookers.","For instance, he would carry alone, without waiting for the help of another attendant, some heavy patient from his bed to the bath-room; he did not shrink from attending to the most filthy among the cholera patients, seeming to despise the possibility of infection, and treating the corpses with cynical indifference.",But even all this did not satisfy him.,"He still longed to do something greater, something more out of the common.","This unappeased longing caused him pain, and brought back his former moodiness, and as he had no one else with whom he could speak, he opened his heart to Matrona.","One evening when they were off duty, and had had their tea, they went out into the fields together.","The Infirmary stood some way out at the back of the town, in the midst of a green far-stretching plain, bounded on one side by the dark edge of the forest, and on the other by the soft outline of the distant town.","Towards the north the field extended into the far distance, and faded into a dim blue horizon; on the south it was bordered by the deep ravine-like banks of the river, which ran through the country roads, shaded on either side by trees planted at regular intervals The sun was just setting, and the golden crosses of the church-towers of the town, rising above the dark green of the gardens, flashed in all their brilliance against the background of the sky, and reflected golden rays.",The windows also of the houses flashed back the red glow of the sunset.,Music could be heard in the distance.,"From the dense ravine, sown thickly with the débris of the fir-trees bordering the river, an aromatic scent arose, whilst the evening wind brought from the forest in caressing waves a mingling of spicy perfumes.","A soft, sweetly melancholy, yet intense feeling, lay over the whole wide expanse.","The Orloffs walked silently through the fields, breathing delightedly the fresh air, which, in contrast with the atmosphere of the Infirmary, seemed to them more than ordinarily pleasant.","""Listen!",there's a band!...,"Is it in the town or up at the barracks?""","Matrona asked in a low voice of her husband, who seemed to be sunk in thought.",She did not like him to brood in this sort of way by himself.,He appeared to her at such moments strange and far away.,"They had seen but little of each other these last few days, so that the moments now when they were together, seemed to her all the more precious.","""A band?""","asked Grigori, as if waking out of a dream, ""the devil take such music!...","You should just listen to the music which is ringing through my soul....

And I would overcome him, even if I myself lost my life in the struggle....","They would erect a cross to me there in the green fields, 'To the Memory of Grigori Andrejeff Orloff ... who freed Russia from the Cholera.'","... That's all I should want!""","His face flushed, and his eyes flashed whilst he was speaking.","""My dear brave one!""","whispered Matrona, and pressed tenderly against him.","""I would throw myself against a hundred sharp knives if I could do any good....

You talk to me, and open your heart to me.... Not once have you scolded me....""

You will scarcely believe me, but I had no notion then how sad and bitter it was....","It is only now that I begin to understand.""",This looking back on her past life roused a new feeling in Matrona's breast against her husband.,"She cared for Grigori as much as ever, and showed him all the tenderness of a loving wife; but it appeared to her at the same time that Grigori was guilty toward her.","Sometimes when talking to him she would adopt almost a protective tone, for his constant restlessness made her feel sorry for him.","Now and then a doubt arose in her mind as to whether it would ever be possible to lead a quiet, peaceful life with him, though she still held steadfastly to the belief that Grigori would, in the end, settle down, and throw off his despondency.","According to the ordinary course of events they ought gradually to have grown accustomed to each other, and reconciled to their every-day life in common.","They were both young, strong and industrious, and many in a similar position would have been contented to go on from day to day, leading the grey, cheerless life of the ordinary worker--the life of poverty, alternating with starvation--their energies completely absorbed in the task of providing their daily bread.","But this ordinary existence was rendered impossible by the unrest which Grigori carried in his heart, and which prevented him from reconciling his inmost soul with the monotony of a daily task.","CHAPTER VIII One dreary September morning the ambulance-van drew up in the courtyard of the Infirmary, and Pronim lifted from it another victim of the epidemic, a yellow-faced, emaciated, half-dead little lad in motley clothes, stained with many colours.","""Another case from Petounukoff's house!""",said the driver of the van in answer to a question as to the quarter from which he had brought the new patient.,"""Tschischik!""",cried Orloff in a tone of pain.,"""Good heavens!",it is Senka.,"Little imp, don't you recognize me?""","""Yes, I do,"" said Tschischik with an effort, as he lay on the stretcher, turning up his eyes to catch a glimpse of Orloff, who was standing behind him.","""Ah!",you merry little bird!,"How did this happen?""",asked Orloff.,"He was quite upset at the sight of the lad, who was completely exhausted with the painful disease.","""Why could it not spare this Innocent child?""","he cried out, shaking his head slowly, and as if concentrating in this cry all his tense horror.","Tschischik was silent, and shivered from head to foot.","""I am so cold!""","he said, as they laid him on the bed and took off his ragged, paint-stained clothes.","""We'll soon pop you into a nice hot bath!""",Orloff promised him.,"""We'll make you well again in a hurry.""",Tschischik shook his head.,"""No, Uncle Grigori....","I shall never be well again,"" he whispered in a dead voice....
