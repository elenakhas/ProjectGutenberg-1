"Several times a day, Petrusha would appear on the steps leading from the court to the bar, take a look with his cunning grey eyes at the old man and ask: ""Now then, how goes it, grandfather?","Better, eh?""","He would swagger about in his pink cotton shirt, his hands in the pockets of his wide linen trousers, whose ends were tucked into brilliantly polished boots.",He was always chinking the money in his pockets.,"His round head was beginning to go bald already above the forehead, but there was still a good thick tuft of fair, curly hair on it, and he loved to throw it back in a foppish way.","Ilya had never taken kindly to him, and now his feeling of aversion grew stronger every day.",He knew that Petrusha did not like Jeremy.,One day he heard the potman giving Terenti instructions concerning the old man.,"""Keep an eye on him, Terenti!",He's an old miser.,He's got a pretty store of cash sewed up in his pillow somewhere.,Keep your eyes open!,"He isn't long for this world, the old mole;

he seemed to have been bleached by his occupation.,"His eyes had got a dull, shy expression, and his body was as though melted in the hot vapours of the bar.",His dirty shirt used to slip up on to his hump and leave his naked loins visible.,"All the time he was speaking with any one he kept both his hands behind his back, trying constantly to draw his shirt into its place, and this habit gave him the air of trying to stuff away his big hump.","When Jeremy sat outside in the courtyard, Terenti would come out frequently on to the steps and look at him, and his eyes twitched as he shaded them with his hand.","The straw-coloured beard quivered on his pointed face as he asked the old man in his weak voice, embarrassed as from a guilty conscience, ""Grandfather!","do you want anything?""","""Many thanks.",No--nothing.,"I don't need anything,"" the old man would answer.",The hunchback turned slowly on his withered legs and went back into the bar.,But the old man felt himself growing weaker every day.,"""It'll soon be all over with me,"" he said one day to Ilya, who was sitting near him.","""It's time for me to die--there's only one thing still----"" He peered round the courtyard mistrustfully and went on in a whisper: ""I'm dying too soon, Ilyushka!",My work is not done.,I haven't had time.,I've stored up money--money.,I've pinched and saved for seventeen years;

the dying man's body lay on the floor at the feet of two dark figures, that in the darkness seemed grown into one enormous mis-shaped creature.","Then Ilya saw how his uncle knelt beside the bed, and held the pillow which he was hurriedly sewing up.",He heard the threads drawn through the stuff quite clearly;

trembling, he put his head out and saw Terenti kneeling on the ground, his head bent, so that his chin touched his breast.","And Ilya heard him praying in a whisper: ""O Lord, our Father in Heaven, O Lord----!""",The whisper reminded him of the death rattle of the old man.,"The darkness in the room began to move, the floor seemed to go round and round, and the wind howled in the chimney: ""Hu--u--u----!""","""Stop that praying!""",called Ilya's clear voice.,"""What?","What is it?""",said the hunchback half aloud.,"""Go to sleep, for Christ's sake.""","""Stop praying,"" repeated the boy, commandingly.","""Yes--yes.","I'll stop.""","The dampness and the darkness in the room weighed more and more heavily on Ilya, his breathing was oppressed and his soul was filled with fear and sorrow for the dead old man, and with a deep ill-will against his uncle.",At last he sat up and groaned aloud.,"""What is the matter?","What is it?""","called out his uncle frightened, and put an arm round him.","But Ilya pushed him back, and spoke in a voice choked with tears, but ringing with bitter pain and horror.","""O God!",If only I could go away and hide from it all.,"O God!""",He could not speak for tears.,"His breathing was laboured in the heavy air of the tap room, and, sobbing, he hid his face on the floor.",VI.,Ilya's character underwent a great change as a result of these experiences.,"Formerly it was only from his school fellows that he had held aloof, as he had never become accustomed to their behaviour towards him or felt the smallest inclination to yield to it.","In the house, on the contrary, he had always been frank and trustful, and had felt a singular joy, if any one of the grown-up people took any notice of him.","Now, however, he kept away from every one, and grew serious beyond his years.","His face wore an unfriendly expression, his lips were compressed, he observed his elders with attention and listened to their conversations with a searching look in his eyes.","The memory of all he saw on the day that old Jeremy died weighed heavy on him, and it seemed to him that not only Petrusha and his uncle, but also he himself was guilty before the old man.","Perhaps Jeremy had thought as he lay there dying and saw his store rifled, that he, Ilya, had betrayed the treasure.","This fear had arisen in Ilya quite suddenly, but had grown in strength and filled his soul with doubt and torturing pain.","He locked his thoughts in his heart and thereby there grew in him a mistrust of all the world, and as often as he noticed anything wicked in any one, his heart was a little easier, as though his own guilt towards the dead were lessened thereby.",And he found so much evil among men and women.,"Every one called Petrusha a hypocrite and a liar, but all flattered him to his face, bowed respectfully to him, and addressed him with humility as Peter Akimytsch.","Every one called big Matiza of the attics by a hateful name; when she was drunk they all pushed or struck her, and once as she sat below the kitchen window, the cook poured a pail of dirty water right over her, and yet they all took from her endless small kindnesses and services, and gave her no thanks but foul names and blows.","Perfishka would call her to watch his ailing wife, Petrusha would get her to wash down the bar room before holidays for nothing, and she was always mending shirts for Terenti.","She went everywhere and did everything without a complaint and very handily, tended the sick devotedly and loved to play with the children.","Ilya saw that the most hard-working man in the whole house, the cobbler Perfishka, was looked upon universally as a ridiculous figure, and that no notice was taken of him except when he sat on the bench in the bar room with his harmonica, half drunk, or reeled about the courtyard singing his jolly little songs.","No one could see how carefully he carried his crippled wife up the stairs, how he put his little daughter to bed, tucked her in, and made all sorts of droll faces to entertain her.","No one noticed him when he taught Masha, with laughter and fun, to cook the dinner and clean the room, then settled to his work, sitting far into the night bent over a dirty shapeless boot.","When the smith was taken off to prison, no one but the cobbler troubled about his boy.","But he took Pashka at once, and the unruly lad waxed the thread, swept the room, fetched water, and went to the shop for bread, kvass and onions.","Every one had seen the cobbler drunk on holidays, but no one heard him next day, when, sober once more, he excused himself to his wife: ""Forgive me, Dunya, I'm not really a drunkard, I only took a mouthful to cheer me up.","I work all the week--it's very weary, and then I just go and have a drink, and----"" ""But do I complain of you?","My God, I'm only so sorry for you,"" answered his wife in her hoarse voice, that sounded like a sob in her throat.","""D'you think I don't see how you slave?",The Lord has put me like a heavy stone round your neck.,If only I could die!,"then you'd be free of me!""","""Don't talk like that!",I won't have you say such things.,"It's I who trouble you, and not you, me, but I don't do it out of wickedness, only I'm so weak.","See now, we'll move into another street.","Everything shall be different, door and windows and everything.","The windows shall look out on the street, and we'll cut out a boot in paper and stick it on them.",That'll be our sign.,"Everybody will come to us in a crowd, and the business will flourish.",Ah!,then!,"work--work--that's the way to fill the cupboard!""",Ilya knew every detail of Perfishka's life.,"He saw how he toiled like a fish that tries to break the ice closing round it, and respected him the more because he jested all the time with every one and had a smile for all occasions, and played so beautifully on the harmonica.","Meanwhile Petrusha sat behind the bar, played cards with an acquaintance now and again, drank tea from morning to night, and scolded the lads who waited on the customers.","Soon after Jeremy's death he installed Terenti as barman, while he amused himself by strolling about the court whistling, observing the house from all sides and tapping the walls with his fists.","Ilya observed many other things, and everything was hateful and depressing, and repelled him from his fellows more and more.",Sometimes all the thoughts and impressions that accumulated in him roused a strong desire to pour out his soul to some one.,But he had no desire to talk to his uncle.,"After the death of Jeremy, there grew up as it were an invisible wall between them, which prevented the boy from approaching Terenti as often and as frankly as before.","Even Jakov could throw little, if any, light for him on the experiences of his soul; for he lived apart from every one in his own special way.","The death of old Jeremy troubled him, he often thought sadly.","""How dull everything is--if only grandfather Jeremy was alive, he used to tell us stories; there's nothing so nice as stories, and he could tell them so well.""","""He could do everything well,"" answered Ilya gloomily.","One day Jakov said to his friend, mysteriously: ""Shall I show you something?","Shall I?""","""Yes--do.""","""But promise you'll never say a word.""","""I promise.""","""Say--may I be damned in Hell, if I do.""","Ilya repeated the formula, whereupon Jakov led him to the old lime-tree in the furthest corner of the courtyard.","There he lifted from the stem a strip of bark, cunningly fastened, and behind it Ilya saw a big hollow in the tree.","It was a space cleverly scooped out with a knife, and adorned with gay rags, scraps of paper, and bits of tin foil.","In the depth of the hollow stood a small figure, cast in bronze, and a wax candle end was fixed upright before it.","""Did you see it?""","asked Jakov, putting the bark again over the opening.","""Yes, I saw.","What is it?""","""It's a chapel,"" explained Jakov.","""At night I can always come out very quietly and light the candle and pray.","Isn't it beautiful?""","Ilya liked his friend's idea, but at once perceived the danger.","""Suppose any one saw the light.","You'd get a fine thrashing!""","""Who's going to see it in the night?","They're all asleep, the world is all quiet.","I'm very little and God can't hear my prayer at the end of the day, but He'll hear it at night when it's quiet, don't you think?""","""I don't know, perhaps He will,"" said Ilya thoughtfully, looking into the pale, big-eyed face of his comrade.","""And you?","Will you come and pray too?""","""What will you pray for?""",asked Ilya.,"""I should ask God to make me very clever, and after that, to give me everything I want.","What will you ask for?""","""I?","I should ask for that too,"" answered Jakov.","After a moment he added: ""I should just pray without asking for anything special, just pray, that's all, and He can give what He likes, but if you think the other way's better, then I'll do the same as you.""","""All right,"" said Ilya.","They decided to start praying the next night at the lime-tree, and both went to bed firmly determined to wake and meet at the corner.","But neither then nor on the following night could they wake, and they overslept on many other occasions; then new impressions came to bear on Ilya and the thought of the chapel fell into the background.","In the twigs of this same lime-tree where Jakov had established his chapel, Pashka set bird snares, to catch finches and siskins.","He had grown clumsy and thin, and his eyes looked this way and that like the eyes of a beast of prey.",He had now no time to loaf about the court.,"He was kept busy with Perfishka all day, and the friends only saw him on holidays, when the cobbler was drunk.","Pashka used to ask them what they were learning at school, and would look gloomy and envious when they gave accounts coloured with a consciousness of their superiority.","""You needn't be so stuck up, anyhow,"" he said once.","""I'll learn something, too, some day.""","""But Perfishka won't let you.""","""Then I'll run away,"" answered Pashka, shortly and decidedly.","And as a matter of fact soon after this speech the cobbler went round the courtyard saying with a laugh: ""My young companion has run away, the young devil!","Couldn't get on with my leather science!""",It was a rainy day.,"Ilya looked at the worried cobbler and then at the dull grey skies, and felt pity for the froward Pashka who might now be wandering God knows where.","He stood by Perfishka under a shed, leant against the wall and looked across at the house.","It seemed to him that day by day it became lower, as though it were sinking into the earth under the burden of the years.","Its old ribs stood out more and more sharply, as though the dirt that had accumulated within them for years could no longer find room, and were pushing them asunder.","Saturated with misery, wild riot and mournful drunken songs its only abundance, pounded and bruised by never-ceasing footsteps, the house could no longer endure its life, and slowly crumbled to decay, while its dim windows stared mournfully upon God's world.","""Heigh-ho!""","began the cobbler, ""the old shop'll soon smash up and strew its spawn over the earth, and we that live in it, we'll scatter to the four winds, we'll seek out new holes somewhere else--we'll soon find 'em, as good as these.","Then we'll begin a new life--new windows and new doors, and new bugs to bite us.","Well, let's have it soon, I've had enough of this pig-sty--only in the end one gets used to it, devil take it!""",But the shoemaker's dream was not to be fulfilled.,"The house did not crumble down, but was bought by Petrusha.","As soon as the sale was complete, Petrusha spent two days creeping into every hole and corner, and feeling and testing the old box of rubbish.","Then came bricks and boards, scaffolding surrounded the whole house, and for three months on end it creaked and quivered under the blows of the workmen's hatchets.","All round there was sawing and chopping, nails were driven in, old beams torn out with loud crackings and whirls of dust, and new ones put in the places, till at last the old shanty had received a new clothing of planks, and its façade was widened by a new outbuilding.","Broad and thickset, the house rose now from the ground straight and sturdy, as though it had driven new roots far into the earth; along its front just below the roof, Petrusha had a big hanging sign put up, which bore the statement in golden letters on a blue ground: ""The Jolly Companions Tavern, P. S.","Filimonov.""","""And inside it's rotten through and through,"" said Perfishka mockingly.","Ilya, to whom he made this comment, smiled in sympathy.","To him, too, this house, after its rebuilding, seemed a gigantic fraud.","He remembered Pashka, who must now be living in another place, and seeing quite different things.","Ilya dreamed, like the cobbler, of other doors and windows and men.",Now life in the house became even more unpleasant than before.,"The old lime-tree fell a victim to the axe, the intimate little corner in its shadow disappeared, and a new outbuilding occupied its place, and all the other favourite places where the children used to sit together and chatter, existed no longer.","Only where once the smithy stood, there was one quiet little corner left, behind a heap of old chips and rotten wood.","But to sit there was to court uncanny feelings, as though beneath the pile of wood lay Savel's wife with a shattered skull.",Petrusha set aside a new place for Terenti--a tiny little room next the big bar room.,"Through the thin partition with green paper penetrated all the noise, the smell of brandy and the reek of tobacco.","It was clean and dry in Terenti's new room, and yet it was more uncomfortable there than in the cellar.","The window looked on the grey wall of the shed, which concealed the sky with the sun and stars, whereas, from the old cellar window, any one kneeling down could see them all quite easily.","Terenti henceforth wore a lilac-coloured shirt, and over it a coat that hung on him as it might have done over a box.",From early morning till late at night he took his place behind the bar.,"He spoke distantly now to every one and held few conversations, and these in a dull, snappy way, as though he were barking, and looked at his acquaintances across the counter with the eyes of a faithful dog that guards his master's property.","He bought Ilya a grey cloth jacket, boots, an overcoat, and a cap.","When the lad put them on for the first time, the memory of the old rag-picker came vividly before him.","He hardly ever spoke to his uncle and his life passed by, monotonous and still; and although the unusual unchildlike feelings and thoughts which had grown in him kept his mind busy, he was burdened with the weight of a suffocating dreariness.",More and more often his thoughts turned back to the village.,"Now it seemed to him quite clear and definite, how much better it had been to live there.","Everything there was quieter, simpler, more intelligible.","He remembered the dense woods of Kerschenez, and his uncle's tales of the hermit Antipa, and the thought of Antipa aroused the memory of another lonely soul--of Pashka.",Where was he now?,"Perhaps he, too, had fled to the woods, and there dug out a cave to live in.","The storm-wind rages through the forest, the wolves howl; it is so terrifying, and yet so good to listen.","And in the winter everything shines in the sun like silver, and all is so still, so quiet, that nothing can be heard but the crunch of the snow under foot, and if you stand a moment motionless, you hear only the beating of your own heart.","But in the town, it is always wild and noisy, and even the night is filled with clamour.","Men sing songs, shout for the police, groan aloud, the carriages pass to and fro, and shake the window-panes with their rattling.","Even in school there is much the same confusion; the boys cry out and do all sorts of mischief, and the grown-up people in the streets roar and insult one another and fight and get drunk.","And all this not only causes unrest, at times it is absolutely horrible.","Mankind here is mad, some are liars, like Petrusha, some evil-tempered and passionate like Savel, others miserably wretched like Perfishka or Uncle Terenti or Matiza.",Ilya was specially surprised and provoked at the hateful conduct which the cobbler had lately displayed.,"One morning, as Ilya was getting ready for school, Perfishka came into the bar, all dishevelled and heavy with want of sleep.",He stood silently at the counter and looked at Terenti.,His left eyelid quivered and blinked constantly and his underlip hung down in a strange manner.,"Terenti looked at him, smiled, and poured him out a small glass, three kopecks worth, Perfishka's usual morning allowance.","Perfishka took it with a shaking hand and tossed it off, but neither smacked his lips after it as usual, nor showed his approval by an oath, and forgot entirely to take his accustomed morsel of food.","With his blinking left eye he looked once more at the new barman searchingly, while his right eye remained dull and motionless and seemed to see nothing.","""What's wrong with your eye?""",asked Terenti.,"Perfishka rubbed his eye with his hand, then looked at his hand and said loudly and emphatically: ""My wife, Avdotya Petrovna is dead.""","""What?","Truly?""","asked Terenti, crossing himself with a glance at the sacred image.","""The Lord have mercy on her soul!""","""Eh?""","said Perfishka sharply, still gazing into Terenti's face.","""I said, 'The Lord have mercy on her soul!'""","""Oh!--yes--yes!","She is dead,"" said the cobbler.",Then he turned suddenly on his heel and went out.,"""A strange man,"" muttered Terenti, shaking his head.","Ilya, too, found the cobbler's behaviour very strange.",On his way to school he went for a moment into the cellar to see the dead woman.,It was all dark and stuffy; the women had come from the attics and were talking half aloud in a group round the death-bed.,"Matiza was dressing the little Masha and asked her: ""Does it catch you under the arm?""","And Masha, standing with her arms stretched out sideways said crossly: ""Yes--ye--es!""","The cobbler sat bent forward at the table and looked at his daughter, his eye blinking all the time.","Ilya gave a glance at the pale, swollen face of the dead; he remembered her dark eyes, now closed for ever, and went out with a painful gnawing feeling at his heart.","When he returned from school and went into the bar room, he heard Perfishka playing the harmonica and singing in a merry tone:     ""Ah, my bride, my only dear,     My heart is gone, I sadly fear,     Why have you stolen it away,     And where on earth is it to-day?""","""Oh yes!","the women have turned me out!--get out, you villain, they screamed--old tippler, they called me.",But I don't mind a bit.,I'm a patient lamb.,"Blackguard me as much as you like, hit me if you like.",Only let me live a little--just a little if you please.,Aha!,"my brothers, every man likes to enjoy his life, eh?","Call it Vaska, call it Jakov, the soul's the same all the time.""","""Tell me who is weeping there?","What does he want, in this affair?","Be still my friend and don't complain,     But stuff your mouth with bread again.""",Perfishka's face wore an expression of idiotic happiness.,Ilya looked at him and felt disgust and fear.,He thought in his heart that without a doubt God would punish the cobbler heavily for such behaviour on the day of his wife's death.,"But Perfishka was drunk the next day too, even behind his wife's coffin he reeled as he walked and winked and laughed.","All held his conduct blameworthy, he was even struck in the face.","""Do you know,"" said Ilya to Jakov the day of the funeral, ""Perfishka is a downright unbeliever!""","""Oh!","bother him!""",answered Jakov indifferently.,Ilya had noticed already that Jakov had altered considerably.,"He hardly ever appeared in the courtyard, but sat indoors all the time and seemed to take pains to avoid Ilya.",At first Ilya thought that Jakov envied him his success at school and was sitting indoors over his school work.,But he soon showed that he learned with even more difficulty than before; constantly his teacher had to reprove him for his inattention and his failure to understand the simplest things.,"Ilya did not wonder at Jakov's indifference over Perfishka, for Jakov took no special interest in the affairs of the house, but he did wish to understand what was passing in his friend's mind and he asked him: ""Why are you so down on me now?","Don't you want to be friends?""","""I?",Not be your friend?,"What on earth are you saying?""","said Jakov taken aback, and then called quickly with an eager expression: ""See now, go into the house.","I'm coming in a moment--I'll show you.""","He jumped up and ran off, while Ilya went to his room in great perplexity.",Jakov soon appeared.,"He closed the door behind him, went to the window, and took a red book from his coat pocket.","""Come here!""","he said, softly, with an important air, sitting down on Terenti's bed and making room for Ilya beside him.","Then he opened the book, laid it on his knee, bent over it and began to read aloud, following the words along the grey paper with his finger: ""And sudden--suddenly the bold knight saw a mountain a long way off, so high that it reached to heaven, and midway up its slope was an iron tower.",There the fire of his courage flamed up in his brave heart.,"He put his lance in rest and charged forward with a mighty shout, and sp--spurring his horse, he rushed with all his-gi--gigantic strength against the door.","There was a--fearful clap of thunder--the iron tower flew into fragments, and at the same time there streamed out of the mountain fire and v--va--vapour, and a voice of thunder was heard, at which the earth trembled and the stones rolled from the mountain down to the horse's feet.",'Ha!,Ha!,"Is it thou, bold madcap.",Death and I have long awaited thee.',"The knight was blinded with the fire and smoke.""","""But who--who is this?""","asked Ilya, amazed at the excitement that quivered in his friend's voice.","""What?""","said Jakov, lifting his pale face from the book.","""Who is this--this knight?""","""He's a man, that rides a horse, with a spear, his name is Raoul the Fearless--a dragon has carried off his bride, the beautiful Louise--but listen,"" Jakov broke off impatiently.","""Hold on a minute--tell me, what's a dragon?""","""Oh!","it's a snake with wings and feet with iron claws, and it has three heads, and breathes fire, and--d'you see?""","""My word!""","cried Ilya, opening his eyes wide, ""that'll be a handful to tackle!""","""Yes, just listen.""","Sitting close together, trembling with curiosity and a strange delightful excitement, the two boys made their entry into a new wonder-world where huge evil monsters met their death beneath the mighty strokes of brave knights, where all was glorious and lovely and wonderful, and nothing resembled the dull monotony of daily life.","There were no drunken, stupid, dwarfed little men, and instead of half-rotten wooden barracks, were gold-gleaming palaces and impregnable mountains of iron soaring to heaven, and while in thought they wandered through this wondrous fantasy realm of romance, at their backs the mad cobbler played his harmonica and sang his rhyming couplets:     ""I'll serve the devil only     While my life is whole,     So when I am done for,     He cannot catch my soul.""","""That's the way, my brothers,"" he went on, ""keep it up every day.","God loves the happy men.""","The harmonica began to whimper again as though it taxed it to overtake the hurrying voice of the cobbler, then he sang a jolly dance tune, his voice as it were running a race with the accompaniment:     ""Never mind if in your youth     Your lot be cold and rough,     Once you make your way to Hell,     You'll find it hot enough.""",Every verse gained laughter and applause from the audience.,"The sounds of the harmonica mingled with the clatter of glasses, the heavy tread of the drinkers, and the noise of the benches dragged here and there, and the whole blended into a wild tumult, not unlike the howling of the winter storm through the forest.","But in the little cabin, shut off from this chaos of noise only by a thin partition of wood, the two boys sat bent over the book, and one read aloud softly, ""The knight caught the monster in his iron embrace, and it bellowed like thunder with wrath and pain.""",VII.,"After the book of the Knight and the dragon came other wonderful works of the same kind--""Guak, or Invincible Loyalty,"" then ""The History of the Brave Prince Franzil of Venice and the Young Queen Renzivena,"" and all impressions of reality in Ilya's mind gave way before the knights and ladies.","The comrades in turn stole twenty kopeck pieces out of the bar till, and so had no lack of books.","They became acquainted with the adventurous journeys of ""Jashka Sinentensky,"" they delighted in ""Japantsha the Tartar Robber-chief,"" and more and more they deserted the harsh pitiless realities of life for a realm where man at all times could tear asunder the bonds of Fate and make a prize of happiness.",They lived long in the thrall of these fairy tales.,Ilya retained the memory of only one event of his daily life during this time.,One day Perfishka was summoned to the police station.,"He went in fear and trembling, but came joyfully back, and with him, Pashka Gratshev, whom he held fast by the hand lest he should run away again.","Pashka's eyes looked as quick and bright as ever, but he had become terribly thin and yellow, and his face had no longer its former froward expression.","The cobbler brought him into the bar, and began to relate, his left eye twitching rapidly.","""Behold, my friends, here we have Mr. Pavlusha Gratshev back again as large as life--just back from the town of Pensa conveyed by favour of the police.",Ah!,what people there are in the world!,No staying happily at home for them!,"When they're hardly able to stand upright they're off into the wide world to seek their fortune.""","Pashka stood by, one hand in the pocket of his tattered trousers, while he strove to detach the other from the cobbler's hold, looking at him sideways, darkly.","Some one advised Perfishka to give him a good sound thrashing, but the cobbler answered seriously, letting the boy go: ""What for?","let him wander a bit, perhaps he'll find his happiness.""","""He'll get jolly hungry, anyway,"" threw in Terenti, then added in a friendly tone, giving Pashka a bit of bread.","""Here, eat it, Pashka.""",Pashka took the bread quietly and went towards the tap-room door.,"""Whew!""","the cobbler whistled after him, ""going off again?","Good-bye then, my friend.""","Ilya, who had witnessed this scene from the door of his room, called Pashka back.","The lad stayed a moment before answering, then went up to Ilya and asked, looking suspiciously round the little room: ""What do you want?""","""Only to say how d'ye do.""","""All right, good day to you.""","""Sit down a minute.""","""Why?""","""Oh, we'll have a chat.""","The short sulky questions, and the hoarse, harsh voice made a painful impression on Ilya.",He wanted to ask Pashka where he had been all the summer and what he had seen.,"But Pashka, who had found a chair and begun to gnaw his bread, started questioning on his own account.","""Finished school?""","""Early next year I'm done.""","""Well, I've done my learning too!""","""Why--how?""","said Ilya, incredulously.","""I've been pretty quick, eh?""","""Where did you learn?""","""In prison, with the prisoners.""","Ilya approached him and asked, looking respectfully into the thin face, ""How long were you in?","Was it bad?""","""Oh, not so bad--four months I had of it in several prisons and different towns.","I got to know some fine people there, my boy, ladies too--real swells!",Spoke different languages and knew everything.,I always swept out their cells.,"Very nice people they were, if they were in gaol.""","""Were they thieves?""","""No, regular villains,"" answered Pashka, proudly.",Ilya blinked and his respect for Pashka increased still more.,"""Russians?""","""A couple of Jews too--fine fellows!","I tell you, my lad, they knew their way about.",Stripped everyone that they got a hand on--properly.,"Got caught in the end, and now going to Siberia!""","""But how did you learn things there?""","""Oh!","I just said 'teach me to read,' and they did.""","""Have you learnt to write too?""","""Writing I'm not so good at, but I'll read as much as you like.","I've read lots of books already.""",Ilya became excited now the conversation turned on books.,"""I read with Jakov, too,"" he said, ""and such books!""","Both began to name all the books they had read, in rivalry.","Pashka had to admit with a sigh: ""I see, you've read the most, you lucky devil, and your books are nicer too.",I've read mostly poetry.,"They had a lot of books there, but nearly all verses.""","Jakov came in at this point, he raised his eyebrows and laughed: ""Now then sheep, what are you laughing at?""",Pashka greeted him.,"""Hullo!","Where have you been?""","""Where you'll never be able to go.""","""Just think,"" put in Ilya, ""he's been reading books, too!""","""Really?""","said Jakov, and came nearer in a more friendly way.","The three boys sat close together, in lively desultory conversation.","""I've seen such things, I couldn't even tell you!""","cried Pashka, proud and excited.","""Once I went two days without eating--not a bite!","I've spent a night in the forest, alone.""","""Was it bad?""",asked Ilya.,"""You go and try it, then you'll know.",And once the dogs nearly killed me.,"That was in Kazan, where they put up a monument to a man, just because he made verses.","A great, big man he was--his legs, I tell you, as thick as that, and his fist as big as your head, Jakov.","I'll make you some poetry, boys--I know how, a bit.""","He suddenly sat straight up, drew his legs in, and, looking steadily at one point, he said, quickly, with a serious, important air:----     ""Men, well fed and richly dressed        Pass through the streets all day,     But if I beg a bit of bread        They answer--go away!""","He stopped, looked at the other two, and hung his head down.","For a minute they all stared in an embarrassed silence, then Ilya asked, hesitatingly:---- ""Is that poetry?""","""Can't you hear?""","replied Pashka, crossly.","""It rhymes--day, away--so of course it's poetry.""","""Of course,"" chimed in Jakov, quickly.","""You're always finding fault, Ilya.""","""I've made more poetry than that!""","Pashka turned to Jakov and went on again:----     ""The earth is wet and the clouds are grey,     The autumn draws nearer, day by day,     And I--have no house for the winter's cold     And my clothes are tattered and worn and old.""","""Ah!""","said Jakov, and looked at Pashka with round eyes.","""That was regular poetry,"" admitted Ilya.",A fleeting blush passed over Pashka's face and he screwed up his eyes as if the smoke had got into the room.,"""I shall make a long poem,"" he boasted.","""It's not so very difficult.","You go out and look about you--stream, dream, tree, free--the rhymes come up by themselves.""","""And what will you do now?""",asked Ilya.,"Pashka let his glance wander round; there was a pause, then he said, slowly and vaguely, ""oh, something or other,"" then added decidedly, ""If I don't like it, I'll run away again.""","For the time being, however, he lived with the cobbler, and every evening the children gathered there.",It was quieter and more cosy in the cellar than in Terenti's room.,Perfishka was seldom at home.,"He had sold for drink all that could be sold, and now worked by the day in various workshops, and if there was no work to be got, he sat in the bar-room.","He went about half-clothed and barefoot, and his beloved old harmonica was always under his arm.","It had come to be almost a part of his body, it had absorbed a portion of his cheerful disposition.","The two were very much alike, out at elbows and worn, but full of jolly songs and tunes.","In all the workshops of the town, Perfishka was known as a tireless singer of gay rollicking rhymes and dance tunes.","Wherever he appeared he was a welcome guest, and all liked him because he could lighten the heavy weary load of existence, with his drolleries tales and anecdotes.","Whenever he earned a couple of kopecks, he gave his daughter the half.",His only care now was for her.,"For the rest, Masha was mistress of her own fate.","She had grown tall, her black hair fell below her shoulders, her big dark eyes looked out on the world seriously, and she played the hostess in the underground room most excellently.","She collected shavings from the places where new building was in progress, and tried to cook the soup with them, and up to midday went about with her skirts tucked up, quite black, and wet, and busy.","But once her meal was prepared, then she cleaned up the room, washed, put on a clean dress, and settled herself at the table before the window to mend her clothes.","While she cobbled away with her needle at the rags, she would sing a gay song, and in her liveliness and activity, she was like a titmouse in a cage.","Matiza would often pay her a visit, and bring her rolls of bread, tea, and sugar, and once even gave her a blue dress.","Masha received the visit quite like a grown-up person, a proper housewife.","She would put the little samovar on the table and serve Matiza with tea, and while they enjoyed the hot stimulating drink, they would chat of the events of the day and Perfishka's conduct.","Matiza used to get quite carried away with anger over the cobbler, while Masha, in her clear little voice, would not dispute, out of politeness to her guest, but still would speak of Perfishka without a trace of resentment.","In everything that she said of her father, a resolute forbearance was always present.","""Quite true,"" she would say, in an old-fashioned way, ""it is not reasonable for a man to drink so.","But he loves gaiety, and only drinks to cheer himself up.","While mother was alive, he did not drink much.""","""Serve him right, if his liver dries up,"" grumbled Matiza, in her deep bass, contracting her eyebrows fiercely.","""Does the soaker forget he has a child sitting at home?",Disgusting brute!,"He'll die like a dog!""","""He knows that I'm grown up, and can look after myself,"" answered Masha.","""My God!","my God!""","Matiza would say, with a big sigh, ""the things that go on in this world of God's!",What'll happen to the girl?,I had a little girl just like you.,"She stayed at home there, in the town of Chorol, and it is so far to Chorol that if I wanted to go, I couldn't find the way.","That's the way with people, they live on the earth, and forget the home where they were born.""","Masha liked to hear the deep voice and see the big face and the brown eyes, like those of a cow.","And, even if Matiza constantly smelt of brandy, none the less Masha would sit on her lap, nestle against her big, swelling bosom, and kiss the full lips of the well-formed mouth.","Matiza used to come in the morning, and in the evening the children gathered in Masha's room.","They sometimes played card games of various sorts, but more often sat over a book.","Masha listened always with great interest while they read aloud, and would give a little scream at any peculiarly terrifying places.",Jakov was more careful of the child than ever.,"He brought her from the house bread and meat, tea and sugar, and oil in beer bottles.",Sometimes even he gave her any money that was left from the purchases of books.,"It had become an established thing for him to do all this, and he managed it all so quietly that no one noticed.","Masha, for her part, took his labours as a matter of course, and made little to do over them.","""Jakov,"" she would say, ""I've no more coals.""","""All right.""","And presently he would either bring some coal or give her a two-kopeck bit and say, ""You'll have to buy some--I couldn't steal any.""",He brought Masha a slate and began to teach her in the evenings.,"They got on slowly, but at the end of two months Masha could read all the letters, and write them on the slate.","Ilya had become accustomed to these relations between the two, and everyone in the house seemed also to overlook them.","Many a time Ilya, commissioned by his friend, would himself steal something from the kitchen or the counter and get it secretly down to the cellar.","He liked the slender brown girl, who was an orphan, like himself, but he liked her specially because she knew how to face the world alone, and conducted all her affairs like a full-grown woman.","He loved to see her laugh, and would always try to amuse her, and if he did not succeed, he grew cross and teased her.","""Dirty blackbird!""","he would cry, scornfully.","She would blink her eyes, and reply jeeringly, ""Skinny devil!""","One word would lead to another, and soon they would be quarrelling in real earnest.","Masha was hot tempered and would fly at Ilya to scratch him, but he readily escaped laughing.","One day, while they were playing cards, he saw her cheat, and in his rage, called at her: ""You--Jashka's darling!""","and followed it with an ugly word, whose significance he understood already.","Jakov, who was present, laughed at first, then seeing his little friend's face contract with pain at the insult, and her eyes shine with tears, he became pale and dumb.","Suddenly he sprang from his chair, flung himself on Ilya, struck him on the nose with his fist, grasped him by the hair and threw him to the ground.","It all happened so quickly that Ilya had no time to defend himself, then he picked himself up and rushed headlong at Jakov, blind with wrath and pain.","""Wait, my boy, I'll teach you,"" he shouted furiously.","But he saw Jakov with his elbow on the table, crying bitterly, and Masha beside him saying to him with a voice choked with tears: ""Let him alone, the beast--the brute--they're a bad lot, his father's a convict, and his uncle's a hunchback--and a hump'll grow on you too, you beast,"" she cried, attacking Ilya quite furiously.","""You beastly dirt-grabber--rag-picker!","Come here--just you come here, and I'll scratch your face for you--you dare touch me!""",Ilya did not stir.,"He was much distressed at the sight of Jakov crying, for he had not meant to hurt him, and he was ashamed to scuffle with a girl--though she was ready enough he could see.","Without a word he left the cellar and paced the courtyard for a long time, his heart tortured with bitter feelings.",At last he went to the window and looked carefully in from above.,"Jakov was playing cards again with his friend, Masha, the lower part of her face concealed with her cards held fanwise, seemed to be laughing, while Jakov looked at his cards and touched first one then the other.",Ilya's heart was heavy.,"He walked up and down a while longer, then boldly and decidedly went back to the cellar.","""Let me come in again,"" he said, going up to the table.","His heart thumped, his face burned and his eyes were downcast.",Jakov and Masha said nothing.,"""I'll never insult you so again, by God, I won't any more,"" he went on, and looked at them.","""Well, sit down then--you!""","said Masha, and Jakov added: ""Silly!","You're big enough now to know what you're saying.""","""No no, we're all little--just children,"" Masha put in, and struck the table with her fist, ""and that's why we don't need any low words.""","""You gave me a jolly good licking, all the same,"" said Ilya to Jakov reproachfully.","""You deserved it, don't complain!""","said Masha, sententiously, and with a darkened face.","""All right--all right I'm not angry, it was my fault,"" and Ilya smiled at Petrusha's son.","""We'll make it up, shall we?""","""All right, take your cards.""","""You wild devil!""",said Masha.,And with that peace was made.,"A moment later, Ilya was deep in the game, thoughtfully wrinkling his brow.","He always arranged to play next to Masha; he disliked her to lose, and thought of little else all through the game.","But the child played quite cleverly, and generally it was Jakov who lost.","""Oh you goggle eyes!""","Masha would say, pityingly, ""You've lost again.""","""Devil take the cards!""","answered Jakov, ""it's jolly dull, nothing but playing cards.","Let's read some more Kamtchadalky.""",They got out a torn and dirty book and read the sorrowful history of the amorous and unfortunate Kamtchadalky.,"When Pashka saw the three children amuse themselves so pleasantly, he used to say in the tone of a world explorer: ""You lead a pleasant life here, you cunning ones.""","Then he would look at Jakov and Masha and smile, then add seriously: ""Go on all the same!","and later on you can marry Masha, eh Jakov?""","""Silly,"" Masha would say, laughing, and then they all four laughed together.",Pashka was generally with them.,"If they had finished a book or if there was a pause in the reading, he would relate his experiences, and his tales were no less interesting than the books.","""When I found, lads, that I couldn't travel easily without a passport, I had to be very cunning.","When I saw a policeman, I used to walk faster, as if some one had sent me on an errand, or I'd get up alongside the nearest grown up person, as if he was my master or my father, or some one; the policeman would look at me and let me go on, he didn't notice anything.","""It was jolly in the villages.","They don't have policemen, only old men, and old women and children, peasants that work on the fields.","If any one asks me who I am, I say a beggar; whom I do belong to?","No one, got no relations.",Where do I come from?,From the town.,That's all.,They'd give me things to eat and drink--good things.,"And then you can go where you like, can run as fast as you like or crawl if you want to.","And the fields and the woods are everywhere, the larks sing, you feel as if you could fly up with them.","When you're full, then you don't want anything else; feel as if you could go to the end of the world.","It's just as if someone was coaxing you on, like a mother with a child.",But lots of times I've been jolly hungry.,Oho!,"and my stomach wasted inside, it was so dried up.","I could have eaten the dirt, my head was giddy; but then if I got a bit of bread and got my teeth in it--ah--aah--that was good--I could have eaten all day and all night.",That was something like!,All the same I was glad when I got into prison.,"At first I was frightened, but soon I was quite pleased.","""I was always so frightened of the police.","I thought when they first got hold of me and began to cuff me, they'd kill me.",But what d'you think it was like really?,He just came softly behind and nipped me by the collar--snap!--I was looking at the watches in a jeweller's window.,"Oh, such a lot.",Gold ones and others.,All at once--snap!,"I began to howl, and he says quite friendly, 'who are you?",Where do you come from?',"So I just told him--they found it out, they know everything.",'Where do you want to go?',they ask you then.,I said 'I'm wandering about'--they laughed.,Then I went to gaol.,"They all laughed there, and then the young gentlemen took me--they were devils if you like--oho!""","Pashka never spoke of the ""gentlemen"" without interjections--evidently they had made a deep impression on him, though their aspect had become vague in his memory like a big, dark spot.","Pashka remained a month with the cobbler, then disappeared again.",Later on Perfishka found out that he had entered a printing works as an apprentice and was living in a distant quarter of the town.,"When Ilya heard it he was filled with envy and said to Jakov with a sigh: ""And we two have got to stay rotting here!""",VIII.,"At first after Pashka's disappearance Ilya felt as though he missed something, but soon he slipped back into his unreal wonderworld.",The book-reading proceeded busily and Ilya's soul fell into a pleasant half-asleep condition.,The awakening was sudden and unexpected.,"Ilya was just starting for school one day when his uncle said to him: ""You'll soon be done with learning now.",You're fourteen years old.,"You'll have to look out for a place for yourself.""","""Of course,"" added Petrusha, ""that won't be difficult among all our acquaintances.",There's a place ready for Jashka--another year and he goes behind the counter.,"And for you, Terenti, I'll open another place close by, you can run it on account, and be your own master.","H'm, yes!",I may well thank the Lord.,"He has cared for me.""",Ilya heard these speeches as though they came from somewhere a great way off.,"They bore no relation to anything that he was busied with then, and left him completely cold.","But one day his uncle waked him early in the morning and said:---- ""Get up and wash yourself--but be quick.""","""Why, what's the matter?""","asked Ilya, sleepily.","""It's a place for you.","Something has turned up, thank God!","You're to go into a fishmonger's.""",Ilya's heart sank with unpleasant anticipation.,"The wish to leave this house, where he knew everything and was used to everything, suddenly disappeared, and Terenti's room, which he had never liked, all at once seemed so clean and bright.",With downcast eyes he sat on his bed and had no inclination to dress.,"Jakov came in, unkempt and grey in the face, his head bent towards his left shoulder.","He gave a fleeting glance at his friend, and said: ""Come on!",Father's waiting.,"You'll come here often?""","""Of course, I'll come.""","""Now, go and say good-bye to Masha!""","""But I'm not going away for altogether,"" cried Ilya, crossly.",Masha came in herself at this point.,"She stood by the door, looked at Ilya, and said sorrowfully:---- ""Good-bye, Ilya"" Ilya tugged at his jacket, got into it somehow, and swore.",Masha and Jakov both sighed deeply.,"""Come and see us soon.""","""All right, all right!""","answered Ilya, crossly.","""See how he begins to stick it on--mister shopman!""",remarked Masha.,"""Oh you silly goose!""","answered Ilya, softly and reproachfully.","Two minutes later he was going along the street beside Petrusha, who was dressed in his best clothes, with a long overcoat and creaking boots.","""I'm taking you to a most worthy man, that all the town respects,"" said Petrusha, in an impressive tone, ""to Kiril Ivanitch Strogany.","He has been decorated and all sorts of things for his goodness and his benevolence; he is on the Town Council, and may be chosen Burgomaster.","Serve him well and properly, and he may do something for you.","You're a serious lad, and not a spoiled darling, and for him to do anyone a good turn's as easy as spitting.""","Ilya listened, and tried to picture the merchant Strogany.","He imagined in an odd way that he must be like Jeremy, as withered up and as good-hearted and sociable.","But when he reached the fish-shop, he saw behind the desk a tall man with a big belly.","There was not a single hair on his head, but from his eyes to his neck, his face was covered with a thick red beard.","His eyebrows too, were red and thick, and from underneath them a pair of little greenish eyes looked angrily round about.","""Bow to him,"" whispered Petrusha to Ilya, indicating the red-bearded man with his eyes.","Disillusioned, Ilya let his head sink on his breast.","""What's his name?""",a deep bass voice boomed through the shop.,"""He's called Ilya,"" answered Petrusha.","""Well, Ilya, open your eyes and listen to me.","From now, there's no one in the world for you but your employer--no relations, no friends, d'you see?","I'm your father and mother--and that's all I've got to say to you.""",Ilya's eyes wandered furtively about the shop.,"Huge sturgeons and shad were in baskets with ice, against the walls; on shelves were piled up dried perch and carp, and everywhere gleamed small tin boxes.","A penetrating reek of brine filled the air, and all was stuffy and close and damp in the shop.","In great tubs on the floor swam the live fish, slowly and noiselessly--sterlet, eel-pout, perch, and tench.","In one a little pike dashed angrily and quickly through the water, hustling the other fish, and splashing water on to the ground with great strokes of its tail.",Ilya felt sorry for the poor thing.,"One of the shopmen, a little fat man, with round eyes and a hooked nose, very like an owl, told Ilya to take the dead fish out of the tubs.",The lad tucked up his sleeve and plunged his arm carefully into the water.,"""Take 'em by the head, stupid,"" said the shopman, in a low voice.",Sometimes by mistake Ilya caught hold of a live fish that was not moving.,"It would slip through his fingers, dart through the water wildly hither and thither, and strike its head against the sides of the barrel.","""Get on!","get on!""","commanded the shopman, but Ilya had got a fin bone stuck in his finger, and put his hand to his mouth and began to suck the place.","""Take your finger out of your mouth,"" resounded the bass voice of his employer.","Next a big heavy hatchet was given to the boy, and he was ordered to go to the cellar and smash up ice into even-sized pieces.","The ice splinters flew in his face and slipped down his neck; it was cold and dark in the cellar, and if he did not handle the axe carefully it struck the ceiling.","At the end of a few minutes, Ilya, wet from head to foot, came up out of the cellar, and said to his employer, ""I've broken one of the bowls somehow.""","His employer looked at him attentively, then said: ""The first time I forgive you, especially as you came and told me, but next time I'll pull your ears off.""","Quite mechanically Ilya adapted himself to his new surroundings, like a little screw fitting into a big noisy machine.","He got up at five o'clock every morning, cleaned the boots of his master and the family and the shopman, then went into the shop, cleaned it out, and washed down the tables and the scales.","As the customers came, he fetched the goods out, and carried them to the different houses, then returned to the mid-day meal.","In the afternoon there was little to do, and unless he were sent anywhere on an errand, he used to stand in the shop door and look at the busy marketing, and marvel what a number of people there were in the world, and what vast quantities of fish and meat and fruit they consumed.","One day he asked the shopman, who was so like an owl:---- ""Michael Ignatish!""","""Well--what is it?""","""What will people eat when they've caught all the fish there are, and killed all the cattle?""","""Stupid!""",answered the shopman.,"Another time he took a sheet of newspaper from the table, and settled himself in the shop door to read.","But the shopman tore it out of his hand, tweaked his nose, and said crossly: ""Who said you could do that, fool!""",This shopman did not please Ilya at all.,"When he spoke to his employer, he said every word through his teeth, with a respectful hissing sound, but behind his back he called him a liar, a hypocrite, and a red-headed devil.","Every Saturday and the eve of every saint's day, when his chief had gone to evening service, the shopman had a visit from his wife or his sister, and used to give them a big parcel of fish and caviare and preserves.","He thought it a great joke to banter the poor beggars, among whom many an old man would remind Ilya very strongly of Grandfather Jeremy.","If such an old man came to the shop door and begged for alms, the shopman would take a little fish by the head and hold it out, and as soon as the beggar took hold of it, the back fin would stick into his palm till the blood came.","The beggar would shrink with the pain, but the shopman would laugh scornfully, and cry out:---- ""Don't want it, eh?",Not enough?,"Get out of this!""",Once an old beggar-woman took a dried perch quietly and hid it among her rags.,The shopman saw.,"He seized the old woman by the neck, took away her stolen prize, then, bending her head back, he struck her in the face with his right hand.","She made no sound of pain nor said a word, but went out silently with bent head, and Ilya saw how the dark blood ran from her nostrils.","""Had enough?""","the shopman called after her, and, turning to Karp, the other shopman, he said:---- ""I hate these beggars, idlers!",Beg?,"Yes, and make a good thing of it!",They know how to get along.,Christ's brothers they call them.,"And I, what am I, then?","A stranger to Christ, I suppose.","I twist and turn all my life, like a worm in the sun, and get no peace and no respect.""","Karp, the other shopman, was a silent, pious fellow.","He talked of nothing but churches, church music, and church worship, and every Saturday was greatly distressed at the thought that he would be late for evening service.","For the rest, he was deeply interested in all sorts of jugglery, and whenever a magician and wonder-worker appeared in the town, off went Karp for certain to see him.",He was tall and thin and very agile.,"When customers thronged the shop, he would wind in and out among them like a snake, with a smile for all and a word for all, and the whole time keeping an eye on the fat face of his employer, as though to show off his quickness before him.","He treated Ilya with little consideration, and the boy accordingly was not at all devoted to him.",But his employer Ilya liked.,"From morning till night he stood behind his desk, opening the till and throwing in money.","Ilya observed that he did it quite indifferently, without covetousness, and it gave him a pleasant feeling to see it.","He liked, too, that his master spoke to him more often and in a more friendly way than to the shopmen.","In the quiet times when there were no customers, he would often talk to Ilya as he stood in the shop-door, sunk in thought.","""Now, Ilya.","Asleep, eh?""","""No.""","""Oh, aren't you?","What are you so solemn about, then?""","""I--I don't know.""","""Find it dull here, eh?""","""Ye--es.""","""Well, never mind, never mind.","There was a time when I found life dull, too, from nineteen to thirty-two.","I found it very tedious working for strangers, and now ever since then, I see what a bore others find it,"" and he nodded his head, as much as to say: ""So it is and it can't be helped.""","After two or three speeches of this kind the question began to busy Ilya, why this rich and respected man should stay all day in a dirty shop and breathe the sharp, unpleasant reek of salt fish, when he owned such a big, clean house.","It was quite a remarkable house; in it all was quiet and austere, and everything was ordered by fixed immutable rules.","And yet in its two stories, there lived no one beyond the owner, his wife and his three daughters, except a cook, who was also housemaid, and a manservant, who acted also as coachman, so there was little life in it.","All who dwelt there spoke in an undertone, and if they had to cross the big, clean courtyard, they would keep to the sides as if they feared to walk across the wide open space.","When Ilya compared this quiet, solid house with Petrusha's, against his expectations he had to admit that the life in the latter was more to be preferred, poor, noisy and dirty though it were.","He marvelled at this conviction of his, and could hardly believe in it; but thoughts of this kind filled his brain more and more frequently and distinctly, and the fact that his employer lived so little in his own house, strengthened Ilya still more in his preference.","He would have liked to ask the merchant just why he spent the whole day in the unrest, noise and clamour of the market and not in his house, where it was still and peaceful.","One day when Karp had gone on some errand, and Michael was in the cellar picking out the dead fish for the almshouse, the master fell again into conversation with Ilya, and in the course of it the boy said with a sudden impulse: ""You might give up your business, sir--you're so rich--it's so lovely in your house and so--so dull here.""",Strogany rested his elbows on the desk supporting his head and looked attentively at his apprentice.,His red beard twitched oddly.,"""Well,"" he asked, as Ilya stopped, ""Said all you want to?""","""Ye--ss, yes,"" stammered Ilya, a little frightened.","""Come here!""",Ilya went nearer to the desk.,"His master caught hold of his chin, turned his face up, looked him in the face with screwed-up eyes, then asked: ""Have you heard any one say that or did you think it yourself?""","""I thought of it--really and truly.""","""Oh!","If you thought it yourself, all right, but I'll just tell you one thing, in future have the goodness not to talk to your employer like that, you understand--your employer.","Bear that in mind, and now get to your work!""","And when Karp returned, the merchant began suddenly to speak to him, for no apparent reason, constantly looking sideways at Ilya, so openly, that the boy quickly noticed it: ""A man must follow his business all his life--all--his--life!",Whoever does not is an ass.,How can a man live without something to do?,"A man who isn't absorbed in his business, is good for nothing.""","""Of course, I quite agree, Kiril Ivanovitch,"" said the shopman, letting his glance travel round the shop as if he was seeking something more to do.",Ilya looked at his employer and fell into deep thought.,Life to him among these men became more and more tedious.,"The days dragged on one after the other like long grey threads, unrolling from some mighty unseen skein.","And it seemed to him that these days would never come to an end, but that all his life long he would stand at this shop door and listen to the tumult of the market-place.","But his intelligence, already awakened by early experience and by the reading of books, was not hampered by the drowsy influence of this monotonous life, and worked on without a pause, though perhaps more slowly.","Every day the lad's soul received new impressions which simmered within him, and filled his head with a cloud of ideas concerning all that passed around him.","He had no one to whom he could pour out his thoughts, which were therefore hidden, in his own breast.","They were many, very many--they tortured him often, but they were without definite form, they melted one into the other, or contended in opposition and lay on brain and heart like a heavy load.","Sometimes it was so painful to this serious silent lad to look on at the concourse of men that he would most gladly have closed his eyes or gone somewhere far, far away--farther than Pashka Gratschev had gone--never to return to this grey dulness and incomprehensible human worthlessness.",On holy days they sent him to church.,"He came back always with the sense that his heart had been washed clean in the sweet-smelling, warm stream that flowed through the house of God.",In half a year he was only able to visit his uncle twice.,"There, all went on as of old.","The hunchback grew thinner and Petrusha whistled louder, and his face once rosy, was now red.","Jakov complained that his father treated him harshly: ""He's always growling that I must begin to be reasonable, that he can't stand a book-worm: but I can't stand serving at the bar, nothing but noise and quarrels and rows, you can't hear yourself speak.","I say, 'put me out as an apprentice, say in a shop where they sell eikons and things, there isn't much to do, and I like eikons.'""",Jakov's eyes blinked mournfully; the skin on his forehead looked very yellow and shone like the bald patch on his father's head.,"""Do you still read books?""",asked Ilya.,"""Rather!","It's my only comfort--as long as I can read, I feel as if I were in another place, and when I come to the end I feel as if I had pitched off a church tower.""","Ilya looked at him and said: ""How old you look--and where is Mashutka?""","""She's gone to the almshouse for some things.","I can't help her much now, father keeps too sharp a look out, and Perfishka is ill all the time, so she has to go to the almshouse.",They give away cabbage soup there and that sort of thing.,"Matiza helps her a bit, but it's hard lines for her, poor Masha!""","""It's dull here--with you--too,"" said Ilya, thoughtfully.","""Is it dull in business?""","""Frightfully.","You've got books at least, and in our whole house there's only one book, the 'Book of Newest Magic and Jugglery,' and the shopman keeps that in his box; and what d'you think, the beast won't let me have it.",I hate him.,"Ah, my lad, it's a beastly life for both of us, isn't it?""","""Looks like it!""","They chatted a while and parted, both very sad and thoughtful.","Another fortnight passed in this same way, when suddenly there came a sharp turning in the course of Ilya's life.","One morning, while business was proceeding in a lively manner, the chief suddenly began to look for something in his desk very eagerly.","An angry red covered his forehead, and the veins of his neck swelled up.","""Ilya,"" he shouted, ""come and look here on the floor, if you can't find a ten-rouble piece!""","Ilya looked at his master, then glanced quickly over the floor, and said quietly: ""No, there's nothing.""","""I tell you, look--look properly!""","growled his employer, in his harsh bass voice.","""I have looked already.""","""Ah, ah!","Wait a bit, you impudent rascal!""","And as soon as the customers were gone he called Ilya, seized the boy's ear in his strong fat fingers and twisted it, snarling in his harsh voice, ""When you're told to look, look!","When you're told to look, look!""","Ilya pressed with both hands against his master's body, released his ear from the fingers, and cried loudly and angrily, his whole frame quivering with excitement: ""Why do you bully me?",Michael stole the money.,"Yes, he did.","It's in his left waistcoat pocket.""","The owl face of the shopman suddenly lengthened; he looked very disturbed, and began to tremble.","Then suddenly he let out with his right arm, and struck Ilya on the ear.","The boy sprang suddenly up, fell to the ground with a loud groan, and crying, crept on all fours into a corner of the shop.","As one in a dream, he heard the threatening voice of his master:---- ""Stay, there, give up that money!""","""It's a lie,"" squeaked the shopman.","""Come here!""","""I swear--I----"" ""I'll throw the weight at your head!""","""Kiril Ivanitch, it's my own money, may God strike me dead if it isn't.""","""Hold your tongue!""",Then silence.,"The chief went to his room, and from there came at once the loud rattle of the balls on the counting frame.","Ilya sat on the floor, holding his head, and looking with hatred at the shopman, who stood in another corner of the shop, and on his side, cast threatening looks at the boy.","""Ah, you vagabond, shall I give you any more?""","he asked in a low voice, showing his teeth.","Ilya shrugged his shoulders, and said nothing.","""Wait, my boy.","I'll give you something, just in case you forget me.""","The shopman strode slowly across to the boy, and looked in his face with round, malignant eyes.","Ilya got up, and with a rapid movement took a long, thin knife from the counter, and said ""Come on!""","The shopman stood still, measuring with a fixed glance the strong sturdy figure, with long arms and the knife in one hand, then murmured scornfully: ""Pooh, you convict's brat!""","""Just come on, come on!""","repeated the boy, and advanced a step.","Everything whirled before his eyes, but in his breast he felt a great strength which urged him bravely forward.","""Drop that knife!""",said his master's voice.,"Ilya shuddered when he saw the red beard and livid face of his master, but did not move.","""Put down that knife, I tell you,"" repeated the merchant quietly.","Ilya, who felt as though he were moving through a dark cloud, put the knife down on the counter, gave a loud sob, and sat down again on the floor.",He felt giddy.,His head and his damaged ear pained him.,"A heavy weight that lay on his breast hindered his breathing, pressed on his heart, and rose up slowly in his throat, choking his speech.",He heard his employer's voice as though he were far away.,"""Here is your salary due, Mishka.""","""But let me----"" the shopman tried to explain.","""Out you go, else I'll call the police.""","""All right, I'll go, but keep an eye on that young cub, I advise you.","He goes at people with a knife--he, he!","His dear father is in Siberia, a convict--he, he!""","""Get out!""",There was stillness again in the shop.,"Ilya had an unpleasant feeling, as though something were crawling over his face.","He wiped off his tears with his hand, looked about him, and saw his master behind his desk, examining him with a sharp searching look.","Ilya got up and went towards his place at the door, staggering uncertainly.","""Stop!","Hold on a minute,"" called out his master.","""Would you really have put that knife in him?""","""Yes, I would,"" answered the boy, quietly, but with assurance.","""Oh, oh!",What's your father in Siberia for?,"Murder?""","""No.","Setting fire to a house.""","""Good enough.""","Karp, the other shopman, came back from an errand at this moment.","He sat down on a stool near the door, and looked out at the street.","""Listen, Karpushka,"" began the master, with smile.","""I've just sent Mishka packing.""","""It's your right, Kiril Ivanovitch.""","""Think!","He robbed me.""","""Impossible!""","cried Karp, softly, but evidently frightened, ""Is that true?","The villain!""",The chief laughed behind his desk till he had to hold his sides and his red beard shook.,"""Ho!",ho!,"ho!""",he laughed.,"""Ah, Karpushka, you conjuror, modest soul!""","Then he stopped laughing suddenly, gave a deep sigh, and said, sternly and thoughtfully, ""Ah, men, men!","All want to live, all want to eat, and every one better than his neighbour.""",He shook his head and was silent.,"Ilya, standing by the desk, felt hurt that his master paid no further attention to him.","""Well, Ilya,"" said the merchant finally, after a long, painful silence, ""let's have a chat.","Tell me, though, have you ever seen Michael steal before?""","""Yes, rather!",He stole all the time.,"Fish and all the rest.""","""And why didn't you tell me?""","""I--I----"" stammered Ilya, after a short pause.","""Afraid of him, eh?""","""No, I wasn't afraid.""","""So--then why didn't you say 'Master, you're being robbed'?""","""I don't know.","I didn't want to.""","""H'm!","You only told me just now out of temper?""","""Yes,"" said Ilya, defiantly.","""There, see!","What a young cub!""","The merchant stroked his red beard for a while, and looked earnestly at Ilya without speaking.","""And you, Ilya, have you ever stolen.""","""No.""","""I believe you--you have not stolen, but Karp now--this fellow Karp here, does he steal?""","""Yes, he steals,"" answered Ilya curtly.","Karp looked at him in astonishment, blinked his eyes and turned away as if the matter did not concern him in the least.","The master's brows contracted darkly, and again he began to stroke his beard.","Ilya felt clearly that something out of the common was impending and awaited the end, strung to the pitch of nervousness.","The flies hovered about in the sharp, reeking air of the shop.",The water in the tubs of live fishes splashed.,"""Karpushka!""",the chief addressed the shopman who was standing motionless in the door and looking attentively at the streets.,"""What can I do, sir?""","answered Karp, and hurried to his employer, looking at his face with submissive, friendly eyes.","""Do you hear what is said of you?""","""Yes, I heard.""","""Well, what have you to say?""","""Nothing,"" said Karp, and shrugged his shoulders.","""Nothing!","What d'you mean by that?""","""It's quite simple, Kiril Ivanovitch.",I am a man that respects himself and so I don't feel that my character can be hurt by a boy.,"You see yourself how absolutely stupid he is, and doesn't understand anything.","So I can forgive his wicked slander with a light heart.""","""Stop, my friend!","Let's have none of your juggling, but kindly tell me, has he spoken the truth?""","""What is truth?""","answered Karp slowly, shrugging his shoulders and holding his head on one side.","""Every one understands the truth in his own way--if you like, you can take his words for truth, but if you don't like, it's just as you wish.""","Karp ended with a sigh, bowed to his employer, and made a gesture that indicated how deeply hurt he felt.","""H'm!","so you leave it to me--you think the youngster silly?""","""Uncommonly silly,"" said Karp with brusque conviction.","""No, my lad, that's a lie,"" said Strogany, and laughed outright.","""How he came out with the truth right in your face!",Ho!,Ho!,Does Karp steal?,"Yes, he steals.",Ho!,Ho!,"Ho!""","Ilya had gone from the desk to the door and from there had listened to this conversation, which he felt clearly had in it something insulting to him.","When he heard his master laugh, a joyful sense of revenge flooded his heart, he looked triumphantly at Karp and gratefully at his employer.","Strogany screwed up his eyes and laughed heartily and Karp hearing his laugh, followed with a dry anxious ""He!",he!,"he!""","At the sound of this thin bleating, Strogany ordered sharply: ""Shut up the shop.""","On the way to the merchant's house, Karp said to Ilya, shaking his head: ""A fool you are, an utter fool!",starting all that rigmarole!,d'you suppose that's the way to curry favour?,You young ass!,"d'you think he doesn't know that Mishka and I, both of us, stole from him--he was a young man once--he!",he!,"As he's sent off Mishka, I've that to thank you for to tell the truth, but for telling tales of me--I'll never forgive that, I tell you straight; it's stupid and wrong, too, to say a thing like that--in my presence too.","No, I can't forget that; it showed that you don't respect me!""","Ilya listened, not understanding clearly, and said nothing.","He had expected Karp to approach him very differently, probably to give him a good thrashing on the way home, and consequently he had been afraid to start.","But in Karp's words sounded contempt more than anger, and for his mere threats Ilya cared nothing.","It was the evening of that day before the meaning of the speech was clear to Ilya, when his employer sent for him to go upstairs.","""Ah!",now you see!,"go on!""",Karp called after him in a voice presaging evil.,"Ilya went upstairs and stood at the door of a big room, with a long table under a hanging lamp, and a samovar on the table.","His master sat there with his wife and three daughters, all red-haired and freckled.",When Ilya came in they crowded closer together and looked at him timidly out of their blue eyes.,"""That's the boy,"" said his employer.","""You don't say so--such a young rascal,"" said the wife anxiously and looked at Ilya as if she had never seen him before.","Strogany smiled, stroked his beard, drummed on the table with his fingers, and said impressively: ""I've sent for you, Ilya, to tell you I don't need you any more, so get your things together and start off.""","Ilya started and opened his mouth in astonishment, but could not get out a word, then turned and went out of the room.","""Stop!""","called the merchant, stretching one arm out after him, and striking the table with his palm, ""Stop!""","Then he held up one finger and went on slowly and composedly: ""It's not only for that that I sent for you.",No.,I want to give you a lesson to take away with you.,I wish to explain to you why I don't need you any more.,"You've done all right as far as I am concerned, you're a youngster that has had some education, you're industrious and honest and strong--yes, you've all those trump cards in your hand, and yet you won't suit me any more.",I can't do with you in my business.,Why?,"you ask--h'm--yes.""","Ilya understood this much, that he seemed at the same time to be praised and dismissed.","The contradiction would not come clear in his mind, but roused in him a strange double sensation and brought him to the idea that his employer himself did not know what he was doing.","Strogany's face seemed to the lad to confirm this impression; on it there was an expression of tension, as though he were struggling in his mind with a thought for which he could not clearly find words.",The boy stepped forward and said quietly and respectfully.,"""You dismiss me because I took the knife to him?""","""Heavens!""",cried his employer's wife.,"""Heavens!","how insolent!""","""That is it,"" said the merchant complacently, while he smiled at Ilya, and tapped him with his forefinger, ""you are insolent.",That is the word--insolent.,But a lad that goes out to work must be humble--humble and modest; the Scriptures teach it.,He must sink himself in his master.,"Everything--his intelligence, his honesty, must be used for his master's advantage, and you take a stand of your own, and that won't do at all, you see, and that's why you're insolent; for instance, you tell a man to his face that he's a thief.","That isn't good, it is insolent; if you are so honest yourself you might tell me what the man does, but quite privately.","I would easily have settled the business, because I am the master.",But you say right out--he steals.,"No, no, that won't do.",If there's only one honest out of three that matters nothing; in these cases one must reckon according to circumstances.,"Suppose there's one honest and nine rascals, that's no good to anyone, generally the one goes to the wall, but if there are seven honest to three rascals, then you're right to speak out, d'you see?","right goes with the majority, and one honest, what's the good of him?","That's how it stands with honesty, my boy.","Don't force your righteousness on people, but find out first if they want it.""","Strogany wiped the sweat off his brow with his hand, sighed, and continued with an expression of compassion mingled with self-satisfaction: ""And then you take to the knife.""","""O Lord!""","cried his wife, and the three girls crowded closer together.","""It is written in the Scriptures, 'He who takes the sword shall perish by the sword.'","H'm--yes--for this reason I can't keep you any more, that's the truth.","Here take this half rouble and go--go your way, you need have no grudge against me, any more than I have against you.","See, I give you half a rouble, take it, and I have spoken to you as one seldom speaks to a boy, quite seriously, that you may take it to heart, and so forth.","Perhaps I'm sorry for you, but you're no good to me; if the linch pin does not fit, the wise man throws it away before he starts his journey.","So, go your way!""","""Good-bye,"" said Ilya.",He had listened with attention and explained the matter to himself quite simply; he was dismissed because the merchant could not get rid of Karp and leave himself without a shopman.,"This thought cheered him and made him content, and his master seemed to him a very unusual man, simple and friendly.","""Take your money!""",called Strogany.,"""Good-bye,"" repeated Ilya, and held the little silver coin tight in his hand.","""Thank you very much.""","""There, he never cried a bit!""",Ilya heard his master's wife say reproachfully.,"When Ilya, bundle on back, came out of the heavy house door, it seemed to him as though he were leaving a grey, far-off land, that he had read of in some book, where there was nothing, no people, no villages, but only stones, and among these stones lived a good old magician, who showed the way out to wayfarers lost in the desert land.",It was the evening of a clear spring day.,The sun was setting and the windows flamed red.,Ilya remembered that other day when first he saw the town from the river shore.,"The bundle, heavy with all his worldly goods, weighed on his back and he slackened his speed.","People on the pavements hurried by and struck against his load; carriages rolled noisily past him; the dust danced in the slanting sun rays, and over everything prevailed a sense of noisy, gay, lively activity.",All that he had experienced during the year in the town was vivid in his memory.,"He felt like a grown-up man, his heart beat proudly and free, and in his ears rang the words of his master: ""You are a youngster that has had some education, you're not stupid, you're strong and not lazy; these are the trump cards in your hand.""","""Well then, we'll try again,"" said Ilya to himself while he slackened his pace still more.","A stirring feeling of joy possessed him, and involuntarily he smiled at the thought that to-morrow he would not have to go to the fish shop.",IX.,"When Ilya returned to the house of Petrusha Filimonov, he discovered with pleasure that he had grown considerably during the time he had spent in the shop.","Every one made a point of greeting him with flattering curiosity, and Perfishka held out a hand to him.","""My respects to my lord the shopman.","Well brother, have you served your time?",I've heard of your bold strokes.,Ha!,ha!,"Ah, brother, men will let you use your tongue to lick their boots, but not to tell them the truth.""","When Mashka saw Ilya, she cried joyfully, ""Ah, how tall you've grown!""",And Jakov was delighted to see his comrade again.,"""This is good,"" he said, ""now we can live together again like we used to.","Do you know, I've got a book called 'The Albigenses,' such a story, I tell you!","There's a man in it, Simon Montfort, he's a real monster.""","And Jakov, in his vague, hurried way, started to tell his friend the contents of the book.","Ilya looked at him and thought with a peaceful content, that his big-headed comrade had stayed just as he was before.",Jakov saw nothing at all unusual in Ilya's conduct towards the merchant Strogany.,"He listened to the whole story, then said simply, ""That was all right.""",This unmoved reception of his experience by Jakov was not to Ilya's taste.,"Even Petrusha, when he had heard Ilya's account of what took place in the shop, had applauded the boy's behaviour and not stinted his approval.","""You gave it him very well, my lad, very cleverly.","Of course, Kiril Ivanovitch couldn't send off Karp for you.","Karp knows the business, and it wouldn't be easy to replace him.","But after such a scene, you couldn't stay on with him.","You stuck to the truth, and played with the cards on the table, you must have come off the better.""","However, a day or two after, Terenti said to his nephew softly: ""Listen.",Don't be too open with Petrusha.,Be careful.,He doesn't like you.,He abuses you behind your back.,"He says, 'See how the boy loves the truth, but why is it?",out of sheer stupidity.',"H'm, yes.","That's what he says.""",Ilya listened and laughed.,"""And yesterday, he praised me; said I'd managed cleverly.","Men are all like that, they'll praise you to your face, but behind your back they'll say things.""",Petrusha's duplicity did not in the least lessen Ilya's heightened self-confidence.,"He felt exactly like a hero, and was convinced that he had behaved very well with regard to the merchant--better than any other had ever behaved under similar circumstances.","Two months later, when a new place had been sought for Ilya, zealously but in vain, this conversation took place between the uncle and nephew: ""Yes, it's bad,"" said the hunchback, gloomily, ""not a place to be found for you.",Everywhere it's the same thing--he's too big!,"What shall we do, my boy?","What I do you think?""","Ilya answered decidedly and with conviction: ""I'm fifteen years old.",I can read and write.,"I'm not stupid, and if I'm insolent they'll only send me away from any other place I get.","Who can do with an insolent man?""","""But then, what shall we do?""","asked Terenti, anxiously, sitting on his bed and supporting himself on it with his hands.","""I'll tell you.","Let me have a big box and buy me some goods--soap and scent, needles and books, all sorts of small things, and I'll go round about with them and do business for myself.""","""What?--What do you mean, Ilusha?",I don't quite understand.,"In the bar room here, in the noise, it always goes tchk!--tchk!",tchk!,"So that my head's got weak, and then there's something never lets me alone, always the same thing, I can't think of anything else!""","A strange tortured expression showed in the hunchback's eyes, as though he wanted to reckon up something and could not get it right.","""Try it, uncle; let me go once any way.""","Ilya entreated, excited by his idea which promised him freedom.","""Well, God help us!","we might try.""","""Ah!",splendid!,"you'll see how it'll go,"" cried Ilya delighted.","""Oh dear!""","Terenti sighed deeply, and went on sorrowfully: ""If only you were quite grown up!",Ah!,"then I could go away, but now you're just an anchor to hold me, it's only for your sake I stay in this beastly hole, and go down, down.",I might go to some holy men and say: 'Servants of God!,doers of good!,interceders!,"I have sinned, accursed that I am, my heart is heavy, save me, pray for pardon for me to my Father!'""",And the hunchback began to weep quietly.,Ilya knew well what sin oppressed his uncle and remembered it clearly.,"His heart was uplifted; he pitied, but could find no words of consolation and was silent, till he saw the tears flow from the sunken, introspective eyes of his uncle, then he said: ""There--there, don't cry any more!",See!,"Wait till I get on a bit in business, then you can get away from here.""","After a moment's silence he resumed consolingly, ""There--you'll see, you'll be forgiven.""","""Do you think so really?""","asked Terenti softly, and the lad repeated in a tone of conviction: ""Of course you'll be forgiven, worse things than that have been pardoned, I'm sure of it.""",So it came about that Ilya took to the pedlar's trade.,"From morning to night he traversed the streets, with his box at his breast, while his black eyebrows contracted, and he looked out on the world full of self-confidence with his nose in the air.","With his cap drawn down on his forehead, he held up his head and cried with his boyish voice beginning to break: ""Soap!",blacking!,pomade!,hairpins!,"needles and thread, pins!","books--beautiful books!""","Life flowed round him in a gay and tumultuous stream, and he swam with it, free and light-hearted, and felt himself to be a man even as all the others were.","He drove a trade round the bazaars, went to the inns, and would order his tea importantly, drink it slowly, and eat a piece of white bread like a man who knows his worth.","Life seemed to him simple, easy and pleasant.",His dreams took on clear and simple forms.,"He imagined how in two or three years he would sit in a clean little shop of his own, somewhere in a good street, not too noisy, and in this shop he would deal in all sorts of clean and pretty wares, that were clean to handle and did not spoil the clothes.",He himself would look clean and healthy and handsome.,Every one in the street would respect him and the girls would look at him with friendly glances.,"When his shop was shut he would sit in a clean bright little room near it and drink his tea, and read books.",Cleanliness in everything seemed to him the essential determining factor of a well-ordered life.,So he dreamed when trade was good and no one hurt him by rough behaviour.,"But if he had sold nothing and was sitting tired in the bar or somewhere in the street, then all the harshness and hustling of the police, the insulting remarks of customers, the abuse and mockery of his fellows the other pedlars, weighed on his soul and he felt within him a painful sense of unrest.","His eyes opened wide and looked deeper into the web of life, and his memory, so rich in impressions, pushed into the wheels of his thought one impression after another.","He saw clearly how all men strove for the same goal as he, how all longed for the same quiet, full and clean life on which his desire was set.","Yet no one scrupled to thrust aside whomsoever was in his way; all were so greedy, so pitiless, and harmed one another, with no necessity, with no advantage to themselves, out of sheer pleasure in another's pain.",They often laughed when they could hurt most deeply and seldom had pity on those whom they made to suffer.,Such images made his work seem hateful.,"The dream of a clean little shop vanished away, and he felt in his heart an enervating weariness.","It seemed to him that he would never save enough money out of his trading to open the shop, and that right on into his old age he must wander about the hot, dusty streets, his box on his breast, and the straps galling his shoulders.",But every success in his undertaking awakened new courage and gave new life to his dreams.,One day in a busy street Ilya quite unexpectedly met Pashka Gratschev.,"The smith's son tramped along the pavement with the assured stride of one free of all care, his hands in the pockets of his torn trousers, wearing a blue blouse, also torn and dirty, which was much too big for him.","The heels of his big, well-worn boots clumped on the pavement at every step.","His cap with a broken peak rested jauntily over his left ear, leaving half of his close-cropped head exposed to the rays of the summer sun.",Face and neck alike were covered with thick greasy black dirt.,"He recognised Ilya from a distance, and nodded to him in a friendly way, without hastening his easy pace.","""Good luck,"" said Ilya.","""Fancy meeting you!""","Pashka took his hand, pressed it and laughed.",His teeth and eyes shone bright and dear for a moment under his black mask.,"""How goes it?""",asked Ilya.,"""It goes as it can.","When there's anything to bite at, I bite, and when there's nothing I whine and lie curled up.",Ha!,ha!,"I'm jolly glad to meet you anyhow!""","""Why do you never come to see us?""","asked Ilya, smiling.",It was pleasant to him to see an old comrade glad to meet him in spite of his dirty face.,"He looked at Pashka's worn boots and then at his own new, shining pair that had cost nine roubles, and smiled complacently.","""How should I know where you live?""",said Pashka.,"""With Filimonov, just the same.""","""Oh!","Jashka said you were in some fish shop or other.""","Ilya related with pride his experiences in the house of Strogany, and how now he was keeping himself.","""That's the way,"" cried Gratschev approvingly, ""they turned me out of the printing works just the same way, for insolence.","Then I was with a painter, mixed the colours and that sort of thing, till one day I sat down on a fresh-painted signboard, and then of course there was a row, they all went for me, master and mistress, and pupils, till their arms were tired out and then sent me to the devil.","Now I'm with a well-sinker, six roubles a month.","I've just had dinner and I'm going back to work.""","""You don't seem in a hurry with your job.""","""Oh!",devil take it!,Whoever knows what work is doesn't get excited over it.,"I must come and look you up some time.""","""Yes!","do come.""","""Do you still read books?""","""Rather.","And you?""","""Yes, when I can.""","""And do you still make poetry?""","""Yes, I make poetry.""",Pashka laughed again happily.,"""You'll come then, won't you?","And don't forget the poems.""","""I'll come right enough.","I'll bring some brandy, too.""","""Have you taken to drinking then?""","""Oh, just a little--but now, good-bye.""","""Good-bye,"" said Ilya.","He passed on his way, thinking deeply of Pashka.","To him it seemed strange that this ragged fellow had showed no envy of his own shining boots and clean clothes, indeed had hardly appeared to notice them.","Again, Pashka had rejoiced openly when Ilya spoke of his independent untrammelled life.","His thoughts filled Ilya with an incomprehensible unrest, and he said to himself: ""Doesn't this Gratschev, then, want the same things as all the rest.","What is there to wish for in life but a clean, peaceful, independent existence?""","Melancholy and unrest of this kind possessed Ilya, especially after he had visited the church.","He seldom missed a service, midday or evening.","He used not to pray, but would simply stand in some corner and look, without any definite thought, at the worshipping crowd and listen to the singing of the choir.","Men stood there, silent and motionless, and there was a certain sense of unanimity in the stillness, as though each were endeavouring to think as all the others thought.","Waves of song, blended with waves of incense, swept through the house of God, and often Ilya felt as though he were borne upwards on the stream of sound to float in the warm caressing air above.","There was something that comforted the soul in the earnest, solemn voice that filled the church, so different from the hubbub of life and not to be reconciled with it.","At first this feeling remained apart from everyday impressions, did not mingle with them and left him undisturbed; but later it came to him to feel as though there was something living in his heart, ceaselessly observing him; shy and anxious it dwelt concealed in a corner of his heart as he went about his accustomed business, but grew in his soul whenever he entered the church and aroused in him a strange, disquieting thought, opposing his dream of a clean, sheltered life.","At such times the tales of the hermit Antipa rose in his mind, and the talk of the pious old rag-picker concerning a loving God.","""The Lord sees all things, knows all things, beside Him there is nothing.""","Ilya would return home full of unrest and perplexity, feeling his dreams of the future fade, and recognising that hidden in him lay something that cared not at all for his little business.","But life renewed its claims on him, and this something dived quickly down again to the depths of his soul.","Jakov, with whom Ilya discussed almost everything, knew nothing of this division in his friend's soul.","Indeed, Ilya came to the consciousness of it against his will, and never voluntarily let his thoughts run on this incomprehensible sensation.",His evenings were spent pleasantly.,"As soon as he returned, he went straight to the cellar and said to Masha quite as if he were the master in his own home: ""Now Masha, is the samovar ready?""",and the samovar would be already prepared and standing on the table steaming and singing.,"Ilya always brought some delicacy with him, almond or honey cakes, or gingerbread or syrup, and for this Masha supplied him with tea.","Besides, the girl had begun to earn money for herself; Matiza had taught her to make paper flowers, and Masha loved to shape red roses out of the thin rustling sheets.",She could earn ten kopecks a day.,"Her father had contracted typhus, and lay for two months in hospital, returning thin and meagre with beautiful dark curls.","His tousled, untrimmed beard was shaved off, and in spite of his yellow sunken cheeks, he looked five years younger.","As before he worked in various shops, frequently did not even sleep at home and left all care and management of his home to Masha.","She patched his clothes and called her father ""Perfishka"" like all the rest.","The shoemaker made great fun of her demeanour to him, but felt an evident respect for his little curly-headed girl, who could laugh as heartily and cheerfully as himself.",Ilya and Jakov took their tea in the evenings with Masha as a regular custom.,"The three children sat at table, and drank long and deeply, chattering of everything that interested them.","Ilya related all that he had seen in the town, and Jakov, who read all day long, told of his books, the scenes in the tap room, complained of his father and many times poured out a screed, quite confused and unintelligible to the other two.","Masha sat all day in her underground room, worked and sang, listened to the conversation of the lads, speaking herself seldom and laughing when she felt inclined.","To them all the tea tasted admirable, and the samovar covered with a thick layer of rust grinned at them in a friendly cunning way with its funny old face.","Almost every day, just when the children had arranged things to their liking, it would begin to murmur and hum, pretending anger, and it would appear that there was no water in it, Masha must take it out and fill it, and this performance had to be repeated several times every evening.","When the moon rode in the heavens, her light would share the festival, falling through the windows into the little room in great, glimmering streaks.","This little cave, shut in with a low, heavy ceiling, and half-rotten walls, almost always lacked air and light, water and bread, and sugar and many things, but life went all the more merrily, and every night many generous feelings and many naïve youthful thoughts were born there.",From time to time Perfishka joined the company.,"Generally he sat on a kind of bench in a dark corner near the sturdy stove, half buried in the ground, or else he climbed on to the stove itself, and his head hung down into the room, so that if he spoke or laughed his little white teeth glimmered in the darkness.","His daughter passed him a big mug of tea and a piece of sugar and bread, he would take them, laughing and say: ""Many thanks Maria Perfilyevna, I am overwhelmed with your kindness.""","Many a time he would say with a sigh of envy, ""You have a fine life, children--confound you!","first rate, just like men and women,"" and then laughing and sighing he would go on: ""Life gets better and better--it's jollier every year; at your age I got nothing but the strap.","It was always on my back, and I howled for pleasure as loud as I could.","When it stopped, my back began to hurt and grumble and sulk, because it missed its old friend; but it didn't have to wait long for it--it was a most sympathetic strap.",That was all the company I had in my young days.,"You'll soon be growing up now, and will want to look back at things--the talks, and all the different things that have happened and all this jolly life, and I'm grown big and old--thirty-six--and have nothing I want to remember.","Not a spark; nothing has remained in my memory, as if I'd been deaf and blind all my young days, I only remember how my teeth chattered for hunger and cold, and the blue patches on my face; how my bones and my ears and my hair stayed healthy I can't understand.","They didn't quite hit me with the stove, but on the stove, bless you, they thrashed me to their hearts' content.","That was an education for you; they twisted me about like a bit of thread; but flog me as they liked, and hack me to pieces, and suck my blood as they liked, the Russian in me clung to his life!",tough fellows these Russians!,"Pound them to bits, and they'll come up smiling!",See me!,"they ground me to powder and cut me to ribbons, and here I live happily like the cuckoo in the wood, flutter from one alehouse to another, and am at peace with all the world.","God loves me, you know; if he saw me, He'd just say: 'Oh!","it's you,' He'd say, and let me go on.""",The youngsters listened and laughed.,"Ilya laughed with the others, though Perfishka's sing-song voice awakened in him a thought which always came back and back obstinately and occupied him greatly.","One day he tried to get clear about it and asked the cobbler with an incredulous laugh: ""And is there really nothing in all the world that you want, Perfishka?""","""Oh!",I don't say that.,"A mouthful of brandy, for instance, I'm always wanting.""","""No, tell me the truth!","There must be something in the world that you want,"" persisted Ilya.","""Want to know the truth, do you?","Well then, I should like a new harmonica, a right-down good harmonica, say twenty-five roubles.",Ha!,ha!,"_then_ I'd play to you!""",He stopped and laughed comfortably.,"Suddenly a thought pricked him, he became serious and said to Ilya, gravely: ""N--no, brother!",I don't want a new one!,"In the first place, it's dear and I should pawn it for drink, for sure, and secondly, suppose it turned out worse than the one I have, what then?","She's a real beauty, the one I've got.",Beyond all money.,"My soul's gone into her, she understands me so well, just my finger on the keys and away she sings!",She's a rare treasure--perhaps there's not another like her in the world.,"A harmonica, she's like a wife.","Once I had a wife too, an angel--not a woman, and if I wanted to marry again--how could I?",I'd never find another like my dear.,"Whether you like it or not, you get measuring the new one by the old, and if she isn't enough, it's bad, for me and for her.",That's the way of things.,Ah!,"brother, a thing isn't good when it's good, but when it pleases you.""",Ilya could readily agree with Perfishka's praise of his instrument.,"No one who heard it but wondered at its ringing, tender tone.",But he could not reconcile himself with the thought that the cobbler had no desire in the world.,"Clear and sharp, the question met him--can a man live his whole life in dirt, go about in rags, drink brandy, play the harmonica and never long for anything different, better?",He had no wish to regard the contented Perfishka as half silly.,"He observed him constantly with the greatest interest, and was convinced that the cobbler at heart was better than all the other people in the house, tippler and good for nothing though he were.","Sometimes the young people ventured to approach those great and far-reaching questions, which open fathomless abysses before mankind, and draw down by force into their mysterious depths man's eagerly inquiring spirit and his heart.",It was always Jakov who began on these questions.,He had acquired an odd habit of leaning against everything as though his legs felt insecure.,"If he were sitting, he either held on to the nearest fixed object with his hands or supported his shoulder against it.","If he were walking along the street with his quick, irregular strides, he would grasp the stone posts by the way as though he were counting them, or try the fences with his hand as though to test their stability.","At tea in Masha's room, he sat generally at the window, his back against the wall and his long fingers holding fast to the chair or the edge of the table.","Holding his big head sideways, with its fine, smooth, tow-coloured hair, he would look at the speaker and the blue eyes in his pale face were either wide open or half closed.","He loved, as of old, to relate his dreams, and could never re-tell the story of a book he had been reading without adding something singular and incomprehensible.","Ilya reproached him for this habit, but Jakov was undisturbed and said simply: ""It's better as I tell it.","One mustn't alter the Holy Scriptures, but any other books, one can do as one likes about.",They're written by men and I'm a man too.,I can improve them if I want to.,But tell me something different.,"When you're asleep, where is your soul?""","""How should I know?""","answered Ilya, who disliked questions that roused a painful disquiet in him.","""I believe they just fly away,"" Jakov explained.","""Of course they fly away,"" Masha confirmed him in a tone of conviction.","""How do you know that?""",asked Ilya sternly.,"""Oh!","I just think so.""","""Yes, that's it, they fly away,"" said Jakov thoughtfully, smiling, ""They must rest some time, that's how the dreams come.""","Ilya did not know how to answer this observation, and said nothing in spite of a keen wish to reply.",For a time all were silent.,"It became darker in the dim cave of a cellar; the lamp smouldered, a strong-smelling vapour came from the charcoal under the samovar.","From far away a dull mysterious noise rolled down to them; it came from the bar room in wild riot and confusion above their heads, and again Jakov's voice was heard: ""See, men make a row, and work, all that sort of thing.","They call that living, and then all at once--bang!",and the man's dead.,What does that mean?,"What do you think, Ilya?""","""It doesn't mean anything, they're old and they've got to die.""","""That won't do, young people die, and children--healthy people die too.""","""If they die, they're not healthy.""","""What do men live for, anyway?""","""That's a clever question!""","cried Ilya, mockingly, since he felt able to reply to this.","""They live, just to live; they work and try to be happy.","Every one wants to live well, and tries to get on; they all look out for chances to get rich and live comfortably.""","""Yes, poor people.","But rich people, they've got everything to start with, they've nothing to look out for.""","""Ain't you clever!",Rich.,"If there weren't any rich, whom would the poor work for?""","Jakov thought a little and then asked: ""You think then that every one lives just to work?""","""Yes, certainly, that is--not quite all.",Some work and the rest just live.,"They worked before, saved money, and now they just enjoy their life.""","""And what do people live for, anyhow?""","""Oh!",get out with you!,Because they want to.,"Perhaps you don't want to?""",cried Ilya out of all patience.,"He could not have said exactly why he was annoyed, whether that Jakov raised these questions at all, or whether that he asked so stupidly.","He felt definite doubts arise in him under the interrogations, and he could find no clear answer.","""Why do you live yourself?","tell me that, then, why?""",he shouted at Jakov.,"""I don't know,"" answered Jakov resignedly.","""I'd just as soon die.","It must be beastly; still I'd like to know what it's like.""","Then suddenly he began in a tone of friendly reproach: ""There's no reason to get cross.","Just think; men live to work, and work comes because of men; it's just like turning a wheel, always in the same place, and you can't see why it goes round.",But where does God come in?,He's the axle of it all.,"He said to Adam and Eve, 'Be fruitful and multiply and people the earth,' but why?""","He bent over towards Ilya, and whispered mysteriously with an expression of fear in his blue eyes: ""Do you know, I believe the good God told them why; but then some one came and stole the explanation, stole it and hid it away, and that was Satan; who else could it be?","and that's why no man knows why he is alive.""","Ilya listened to the disconnected sentences, felt them possess his soul and was silent.","But Jakov continued faster and more softly, fear quivered on his pale face, and his speech became more confused: ""What does God want of you?",Do you know?,"Aha!""",It sounded like a cry of triumph out of the flood of his trembling words.,Then again they poured out of his mouth tumultuously in disconnected whispers.,"Masha gazed astounded, open-mouthed at her friend and protector.",Ilya wrinkled his brows.,He was pained that he could not follow Jakov's words.,"He considered himself the cleverer, but Jakov constantly reduced him to wonder by his wonderful memory and the fluency with which he spoke on all kinds of difficult questions.","If he became weary of listening silently, and too straitly caught by the heavy cloud that Jakov's words begot in him, then he used to interrupt the speaker angrily: ""Oh!",shut up for any sake!,What are you babbling of?,"You've read too much, that's the truth--do you understand yourself what you say?""","""But that's just what I'm saying, that I don't understand at all,"" answered Jakov, wounded and obstinate.","""Then say straight out I don't understand anything, instead of chattering like a maniac, while I've got to listen to you!""","""No, wait a minute,"" Jakov went on.","""Everything is beyond our understanding.","Take the lamp, for instance--I see there is fire in it, but where does the fire come from?",One minute it's there and the next it's gone.,"You strike a match, it burns--then the fire must be in it all the time--or does it fly about in the air, invisible?""",Ilya let himself be attracted by this new question.,"His face lost its contemptuous expression, and looking at the lamp, he said: ""If it were in the air, then it would always be warm.","But the match burns just the same in the frost, so it can't be in the air.""","""But then, where is it?""",and Jakov looked expectantly at his friend.,"""It's in the match,"" Masha's voice struck in.","But the two friends, absorbed in the weighty argument, let Masha's remark pass unperceived.",She was quite used to the treatment and did not resent it.,"""Where is it?""",cried Jakov again excitedly.,"""I don't know, and I don't want to know!","I only know you'd better not put your hand in it, and that it is warm when you're near it.","That's enough for me.""","""Oh!","how clever!""",cried Jakov with lively displeasure.,"""I don't want to know.","I can say that, any fool can.","No, explain to me, where does the fire come from?","Bread I can understand, the corn gives the grain, and from the grain comes the flour, and the dough from the flour, and there's the bread.","But what is man born for?""",Ilya looked with astonishment and envy at the big head of his friend.,"Sometimes when Jakov's questions drove him into a corner, he sprang up and uttered harsh, insulting words, more often he drew back to the stove, leant his broad, sturdy figure against it, and said, shaking his curly head and accentuating his words: ""You make my head go round with your topsy-turvy talk.",What sort of a life do you live?,To stand behind a counter--that's not so very difficult.,"You want to see the whole of life stand before you like a statue; you ought to wander about the town from morning to night, day after day like I do and earn your own bread, then you wouldn't worry your head over such silly things, you'd think all the time how to manage things so as to get on.",Your head's so big that all this trash spreads about in it.,"Clever thoughts are small, they don't drive your head silly.""","Jakov sat silent, bent over his chair, gripping the table.","From time to time his lips moved soundlessly, and his eyes blinked.","But when Ilya had finished and sat down again, Jakov began to philosophise anew: ""They say there's a book--a science--called 'Black Magic.'","Everything is explained in it, how and why and wherefore.","I'd like to find that book and read it, wouldn't you?","It must be very horrible.""","During the conversation, Masha had sat down on her bed and looked with her dark eyes first at one and then at the other.","Then she began to yawn, swayed wearily, and finally stretched herself out on her couch.","""Now then, time for bed,"" said Ilya.","""Wait, I'll just say good-night to Masha and put out the lamp.""","Then seeing Ilya stretch out a hand to open the door, he cried pettishly: ""Oh do wait.","I'm frightened in the dark alone.""","""What a fellow you are!""",said Ilya contemptuously.,"""Sixteen, and like a little child.","I'm not afraid of anything, if the devil came in my way, I wouldn't budge an inch.","But you----"" He made a scornful gesture.","Jakov looked once like an anxious nurse at Masha, and turned the lamp down.","The flame flickered and went out and the darkness of night invaded the room silently from all sides, or on the nights when the moon stood high in the heavens, her gentle silver light streamed through the window on to the floor.",X.,"One day on a holiday, Ilya Lunev returned home, pale, with clenched teeth, and threw himself fully dressed on his bed.","Wrath lay on his heart like a cold immovable lump, an aching pain in his neck kept him from moving his head, and he felt as though his whole body suffered from the bitter wrong he had undergone.","That morning a policeman had permitted him, at the price of a piece of soap and a dozen hooks, to take his stand in front of the circus, where a performance was to be given, and Ilya had placed himself conveniently close to the entrance.","Then the assistant district superintendent came by, struck him on the neck, overthrew the stand that supported his box, and scattered his wares over the ground.","Some things were lost, others fell in the dirt and were spoiled.","Ilya picked up what he could and said: ""That is not fair, sir.""","""Wha--at?""","said the other, stroking his red moustache.","""You've no right to strike me.""","""Oh!",is that it?,"Migunov, take him off to the station,"" said the assistant quietly.","And the same policeman who had given Ilya leave to stand there, took him to the station, where he was detained till the evening.","Before this Ilya had had slight conflicts with the police, but this was the first time he had been detained, and his soul was filled with shame and hate.","He lay on his bed with his arms locked, and hugged the torturing sensation of pain that weighed on his heart.","Behind the wall that separated his room from the bar came a confused noise of bustle and the talking of many voices, like the sound of swift turbid brooks, dashing down from the mountains in autumn.","He heard the rattle of the tin plates, the clink of glasses, the loud calling of the customers for brandy or tea or beer, the waiters' answers.","""One minute!",coming!,"coming!""","and, piercing the noise like a steel string vibrating, a high, throaty voice sang dismally, ""I never thought that I should lose thee.""","Another voice, a deep bass, that blended with the chaos, sang softly and harmoniously, ""Oh, youth that passes quickly by.""","Then both voices united in a clear stream of melancholy notes that mastered the tumult for a second or two:     ""No riches were ever my portion.","And lonely my pathway through life.""","Some one cried aloud, with a voice that sounded as though it came from a larynx of dry cracked wood: ""Do not lie!","for it is written, 'Be patient and abide, and I will strengthen thee in the hour of trial.'""","""Liar yourself,"" struck in another voice sharply and briskly, ""for it is also written, 'Since thou art neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.'",D'you see?,"what have you proved?""","Loud laughter followed and then a squeaking voice: ""So I gave her one in her silly face, and one on the ear, and one on the teeth, smack!",smack!,"smack!""","""Ha!",ha!,ha!,the devil!,"and what then?""","The squeaking voice went on, shrilly and rapidly.","""She toppled over on to the ground and I hit her again on her pretty mouth--there's one for you, I kissed you once, and now I'll beat you.""","""Hullo, you Bible reader!""",cried a voice mockingly.,"""No.","I can't contain myself, I'm so hot-tempered.","How can a fellow help it!""","""I love, I accuse, and I punish--have you forgotten?","And then again, 'Judge not that ye be not judged,' and the words of King David--have you forgotten?""","Ilya listened to the quarrelling, the song and the laughter for a long time, but all fell alike on his soul and roused no familiar images.","Before him in the darkness swam the lean face of the police officer who had so hurt him, with a big hooked nose, greenish, evil, twinkling eyes, and a quivering red moustache.",He stared at the face and clenched his teeth harder.,But behind the wall the song rose louder as the singers were carried away and let their voices ring out louder and more freely.,"The warm, melancholy notes found a way to Ilya's heart, and melted the icy lump of rage and bitterness that lay there.","""I wandered on so bravely,"" sang the high voice, ""From mountain land to sea,"" went on the second, and then joined again:     ""Siberia I have traversed     To seek the pathway home.""",Ilya sighed and began to attend to the sad words of the song.,They stood out against the tumult of the tap room like little stars in a cloudy sky.,The clouds hurry on and the stars alternately shine out and vanish.,"""My tongue was tortured with hunger,     My limbs were stiffened with frost.""","""Sing away, nightingales!""",a voice shouted encouragingly.,"""They're singing so beautifully,"" thought Ilya, ""that it catches hold of one's heart, and presently they'll get drunk and fight most likely; man never holds on to the good very long.""","""Ah!","cruel, cruel fate,"" lamented the tenor, and the bass, deep and powerful, intoned:     ""Thou load of iron weight.""","Suddenly, before Ilya's mind flashed the vision of old Jeremy.","The old man shook his head and spoke while the tears flowed down his cheeks: ""I have seen--I have seen, but have never perceived the truth.""","Ilya thought that Jeremy, who loved God from his heart, had saved money in secret; and Terenti feared God, and had stolen it.","And all men alike are thus divided in their souls, in their breasts is a balance and the heart inclines like the indicator of the scales, now to one side, now to the other and weighs the good and the bad.","""Aha--a!""","some one roared in the bar room, and at once something fell to the ground with a crash that shook Ilya's bed beneath him.","""Stop!","for God's sake.""","""Hold him!","Ah!""","""Help!","Police!""","Every moment the noise grew stronger and more vehement, a confused medley of new sounds was added to it, and roared in a wild whirling howl through the air like a pack of evil, hungry, close-chained hounds.",Individual voices were lost in the chaos of uproar.,Ilya listened with a certain pleasure; it pleased him to find that occur that he had foreseen.,It was an exact confirmation of his opinion of mankind.,"He rolled over on his bed, put his hands under his head and abandoned himself again to his thoughts: ""My grandfather Antipa must have sinned greatly, if he repented in silence for eight whole years, and every one forgave him, spoke of him with respect, and called him righteous; but they drove his children to ruin.","One son they sent to Siberia, the other they hunted out of the village.","""Here one must reckon in a special way.""",The words of the merchant Strogany returned to Ilya's mind.,"""If there is one honest man to nine rogues, no one is any the better, and the one goes to the wall--it is the majority that is right.""",Ilya laughed involuntarily.,"Through his heart glided a cold, evil feeling of anger against men, like an adder.","Well-known pictures rose before him--big, fat Matiza turned in the mud in the midst of the court and groaned: ""A--ah!","my dearest mother--my darling mother--if only you would forgive me.""","Perfishka, quite drunk, was standing by, swaying to and fro, and said reproachfully: ""How drunk she is!","the pig!""","And Petrusha, healthy and red-cheeked, stood on the steps and laughed contemptuously.","Ilya thought of all these things, and his heart contracted, and became even more sober, more hardened.",The disturbance was over in the bar room.,"Three voices, those of two women and a man, were attempting to sing a song, but without great success.","Some one had brought a harmonica; he played a little, very badly, then stopped.","By the wall against Ilya's bed, two people conversed half aloud with frequent heavy sighs.","Ilya listened with a strange sense of enmity: ""One lives, and works, and toils all one's life; there isn't any sense in it, and all the others live, and our sort goes hungry; we can't stand fast, brother, for all we straddle our legs.""","""It's a fact.""","""And one can't see how it's ever going to get better.",Honest work's no good; builds no stone houses.,How long can a man stand such a jolly life?,"His bit of strength's gone before he knows, then, that means the end.""","""Ah!","yes--yes--but what's a man to do?""","""And one isn't strong enough or quick enough, for dishonest work.","The frog would like to taste the nut, but he's no teeth.""","""O God, our Father.""",Ilya sighed involuntarily.,"Suddenly he recognised Perfishka's voice, ringing clearly through the bustle and noise.","The cobbler shouted in his quick, sing-song way: ""Fill your cup!",fill it up to the brim.,"'Tis your master pays, leave it to him.","Let us drink, let us love!",Through the world let us rove.,"And who ever says no, to the devil may go.""",Cheerful laughter and applause followed.,"Then again the low voice near the wall: ""I've worked since I was a youngster.",I'm near forty.,Never once I've earned enough to eat.,"Sweat comes every day, but not soup, and at home it's all misery and crying.","The children whimper, and the wife grumbles; a fellow can't stand it--you just lose your patience and go out and get properly drunk, and when you're sober, all you see is that the trouble's got worse.""","""Yes--yes, it's true.""","""One prays, 'Father in Heaven, have mercy.",Why dost Thou send this misery?',"but it looks as if He didn't hear.""","""No, He doesn't seem to hear.""","Ilya was weary of this mournful lamentation, and the monotonous assenting voice, which sounded even more melancholy than the other that complained.","He turned on his bed, and knocked against the wall loudly.",The two voices were silent.,He could no longer endure his couch; a torturing restlessness drove him to get up.,"He stood up, went out into the courtyard and stood on the steps full of a longing to fly somewhere away--where--he did not know.",It was late; Masha was asleep.,"It was no use to talk to an odd fellow like Jakov, and besides, he, too, was inside the house, in bed.","Ilya never cared to go to Jakov's room, for every time Petrusha saw him there he seemed angered and his brows contracted.","A cold autumn wind was blowing; a dense, almost black, darkness filled the court and the sky was invisible.",All the sheds and outbuildings looked like great masses of darkness solidified by the wind.,"Strange sounds came through the damp air--a hurrying, a rustling, a low murmuring, like the lament of men over the misery of life.","The wind whipped his breast, smote his face, blew a damp, cold breath down his back, a cold shudder ran through him, but he did not move.","""I can't go on so,"" he thought.","""I can't.","Get out of all this dirt, and restlessness and confusion, live alone somewhere, clean and quiet.""","""Who's there?""",said a muffled voice suddenly.,"""I--Ilya.","Who's speaking?""","""I--Matiza.""","""Where are you?""","""Here, on the wood pile.""","""Why?""","""Only because----"" Both were silent.","""To-day's the day my mother died,"" after a moment, said Matiza's voice out of the darkness.","""Is it long ago?""","asked Ilya, just to say something.","""Oh!",ever so long--fifteen years--more.,"And your mother, is she alive?""","""No.",She's dead too.,"How old are you then?""","""Close on thirty,"" said Matiza, after a pause.","""I'm old already, my foot hurts so, it's swollen as big as a melon and it hurts.","I've rubbed it and rubbed it with all sorts of things, but it's no better.""","""Why don't you go to the hospital?""","""Too far.","I can't go so far.""","""Take a cab.""","""No money.""",Some one opened the bar room door; a torrent of loud sounds poured into the court.,The wind caught them up and strewed them hither and thither in the darkness.,"""And you, why are you here?""",asked Matiza.,"""Oh!","I was dull.""","""Same as I.","Up in my room it's like a coffin.""",Ilya heard a deep sigh.,"Then Matiza said, ""Shall we go to my room?""","Ilya looked in the direction of the voice and answered indifferently: ""All right.""",Matiza went first up the stair to her garret.,She set always the right foot on each step and dragged the left slowly after with a low moaning.,"Ilya followed, unthinking, equally slowly, as though his depression of soul hindered his ascent as much as Matiza's foot delayed her.","Matiza's room was long and narrow, and the ceiling was actually the shape of a coffin lid.","Near the door stood a Dutch stove, and along the wall, with its head against the stove a wide bed; opposite the bed a table and two chairs; a third chair stood in front of the window that appeared as a dark spot in the grey wall.",Up here the howling and rushing of the wind was heard very distinctly.,"Ilya sat down in the chair by the window, looked round the walls and asked, pointing to a little eikon in one corner: ""What picture is that?""","""Saint Anna,"" said Matiza softly and devoutly.","""And what's your own name?""","""Anna, too, didn't you know?""","""No.""","""Nobody knows!""","said Matiza, and sat down heavily on the bed.","Ilya looked at her but felt no desire to speak; Matiza also was silent and so they sat for a space, three minutes or so, dumb, with no indication that they noticed one another.","Finally Matiza asked: ""Well, what shall we do?""","""I don't know,"" answered Ilya, undecidedly.","""Well, that's good,"" said the woman, and laughed scornfully.","""What then?""","""First you can treat me; go and get a jug of beer.",No--buy me something to eat.,"Nothing else, just something to eat.""","She faltered, coughed, and then added in a shamefaced way: ""You see, since my leg's been bad, I've earned nothing--because I can't go out; all I had is used up; to-day's the fifth day I've sat at home, so it's no wonder.","Yesterday it was a near thing, and to-day I've eaten nothing; it's true, by God, it's true.""",For the first time Ilya became conscious that Matiza was a prostitute.,"He looked close into her big face and saw that her eyes smiled a little, and her lips moved as though they were sucking something invisible.","He felt a certain awkwardness before her, and yet a strange interest that he could not explain.","""I'll get you something, and beer too.""","He got up quickly, hurried downstairs and stood a moment before the kitchen door.",Suddenly he felt a disinclination to go back to the garret; but it only flickered like a tiny spark in the melancholy darkness of his soul and at once faded out.,"He went into the kitchen, bought some scraps of meat from the cook for ten kopecks, a couple of slices of bread, and other odds and ends of eatables.",The cook put it all in a dirty sieve.,"Ilya took it in both hands like a dish, went out into the passage and stood a moment, wondering how to get the beer.",Terenti would question him if he fetched it himself from the bar.,He called the dish-cleaner from the kitchen and bade him get it.,"The man ran off, was back in a moment and gave him the bottles without a word, and lifted the latch of the kitchen door.","""Hold on,"" said Ilya, ""it isn't for myself; a friend is paying me a visit, it's for him.""","""Eh?""","""I'm treating a friend.""","""Oh, well, what's the odds?""",Ilya felt that he had no need to lie and was a little uncomfortable.,"He went upstairs, slowly, listening attentively lest any one should call to him.","But there was no sound, save the roar of the storm, no one called him back and he returned to the woman in the garret, with a distinct, though shy, feeling of pleasure.","Matiza set the sieve on her lap, and with her big fingers picked out the grey fragments of meat without a word, stuffed them into her mouth and began to eat noisily.","Her teeth were large and sharp, and before she took a bite she looked at the morsel all round as though to select the most tasty side.","Ilya looked at her insolently and tried to imagine how he would embrace her and kiss her, then again feared to conduct himself awkwardly and be laughed at.",He turned hot and cold with the thoughts as they came.,The wind swept over the house.,"It forced a way through the window in the roof, and rattled the door, and every time the door shook, Ilya trembled with anxiety lest any one should enter and surprise him.","""Mayn't I bolt the door?""",he said.,Matiza nodded silently.,"Then she put the sieve on the stove, crossed herself before the picture of Saint Anna, and said devoutly: ""Praise to thee, at least my hunger is satisfied.",Ah!,"how little is enough for the children of men!""",Ilya said nothing.,"She looked at him, sighed, and went on: ""And who desires much, from him also much shall be desired.""","""Who will desire it?""","""Why, God!","Don't you know that?""",Again Ilya did not reply.,"The name of God from her lips roused in him a sudden feeling, vague and not to be expressed in words, that resisted the desire of his mind.","Matiza supported herself on the bed with her hands, raised up her big body and propped herself against the wall.","Then she said in a careless voice: ""Just now, while I was eating, I was thinking of Perfishka's daughter.",I've thought about her for a long time.,"She lives there, with you and Jakov; it won't be good for her, I'm afraid; you will ruin the girl before her time, and then she'll be started on the road I travel, and my road is a foul, a damnable road, and the women and girls that go along it don't go upright as men should, but crawl like worms.""","She was silent for a while, looked at her hands as they lay on her knees, then went on again: ""The girl is growing tall.","I've asked all my acquaintances, cooks, and other women, to see if I could get a place for the child.","No, they say there's no place; they say, 'sell her, it will be better for her,' they say, 'she'll get money and clothes, and somewhere to live'--it seems as though they're right.","Many a rich man whose body is failing and his mind filthy, will buy a young girl, when women won't look at him any more, and will ruin her--the beast.","Perhaps she has a good time with him, but it's disgusting, all the same, really, and it's better without that.","Better for her to live hungry and in honour, than----"" She began to cough, as though a word had stuck in her throat, and then finished her sentence with evident effort, but in the same indifferent voice: ""Than in shame and hungry all the same, like me, for instance.""",The wind whistled along the floor and rattled fiercely at the door.,"A fine rain drummed on the galvanised iron roof, and outside in the darkness in front of the window a soft whistling sound was heard.","""E--e--e!""","The indifferent tone, and Matiza's plump, inexpressive face, made a barrier to the feelings surging up in Ilya, and took from him the courage to express his desire.","Matiza pushed him away, he thought, and he grew angry with her.","""O God!","O God!""",she sighed softly.,"""Holy Mother.""","Ilya jerked his chair backwards and forwards crossly, and said: ""You call yourself impure, and all the time you're saying: 'God--God.'","Do you think He cares, that His name's always on your lips?""","Matiza looked at him, then after a pause, shaking her head: ""I don't understand,"" she said.","""There's nothing to understand,"" Ilya burst out, getting up from his chair.","""You're all alike!",first you let your sinfulness drive you--then it's 'O God!',"If you want God, then leave your sin!""","""What!""","cried Matiza, troubled.","""What do you mean?",Who should call to God if not sinners?,"Who else?""","""I don't know who else,"" cried Ilya, feeling an unconquerable desire to wound this woman and the whole human race, deeply and cruelly.","""I only know it doesn't belong to you to speak of Him, not you, at any rate.",You take Him as a cover for your sins--I see.,I'm not a child now.,I can use my eyes.,"Every one laments, every one complains, but why are they all so worthless?","Why do they lie, and rob one another?",Why are they so greedy for a scrap of bread?,Ha!,ha!,"First the sin is committed, then it's 'O Lord, have mercy!'","I see through you, you liars, you devils!","you lie to yourselves, and you lie to your God.""","Matiza said nothing, but looked at him with her mouth open, and her neck outstretched, and an expression of dull-witted astonishment in her eyes.","Ilya strode to the door, drew back the bolt with a jerk and went out slamming the door to behind him.","He felt that he had insulted Matiza grossly, and he was glad of it; his heart was lighter and his head clearer.","He descended the stairs with a firm step and whistled as he went through his teeth; but his wrath still supplied him with hard, contemptuous words.","He felt that all these words glowed in him like flames, and illumined the darkness of his soul, and showed the way which led him apart from mankind.","The words fitted not only Matiza, but Terenti, too, and Petrusha, and Strogany, and in short, every one.","""That's it,"" he thought, as he reached the court again.","""Just to stand no nonsense from you rabble!""",The wind chased round the court howling and whistling.,"Somewhere some one was knocking and the air was full of short detached sounds, like horrible, cold-blooded laughter.","Soon after his visit to Matiza, Ilya began to go after women.",The first time it happened in this way.,"He was going home one evening when a girl spoke to him: ""Won't you come with me?""","He looked at her, then walked along beside her silently.","He hung his head as he went, and looked round frequently, fearing all the time to meet an acquaintance.","After a few paces side by side, the girl said, warningly: ""You must give me a rouble.""","""All right,"" said Ilya, ""only hurry.""",And till they reached the girl's house they exchanged no further word; that was all.,"Acquaintance with women led him at once into great expense, and more and more often Ilya came to the conclusion that his pedlar's trade only wasted his time and strength to no purpose and would never help him to the peaceful life he desired to lead.","He meditated long, whether to establish lotteries like the other pedlars, and so cheat the public as they did.",But further consideration convinced him that these methods were too small and full of anxiety.,"He would have either to bribe the police or hide from them, and both courses were distasteful to him.","He liked to look all men straight in the face and felt it a constant pleasure to be always cleaner and better dressed than the other pedlars, to drink no brandy and practise no deceptions.","Self-controlled and self-respecting, he walked the streets, and his clean-cut face with its high cheek-bones had always a serious, sober expression.","When he spoke he drew his dark eyebrows together, but he spoke seldom and always deliberately.",Often he dreamed how splendid it would be if he could find a thousand roubles or more.,All thieves' tales roused in him a burning interest.,He bought newspapers and read attentively all details of robberies and then looked for days to know if the thieves were discovered or no.,"If they were caught, Ilya would rage and say to Jakov: ""Asses!","to let themselves be caught, better let it alone, if they don't understand the business.","Fools!""","One day he was sitting in his room with Jakov when he said: ""The knaves have a better time in the world than the honest people.""",A mysterious expression came into Jakov's face.,"His eyes blinked and he said in the subdued tone that he always had when he spoke of unusual things: ""The day before yesterday, your uncle had tea in the bar with an old man; he must have been a Bible preacher, and this old man said that in the Bible it was written: 'The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.'""","""You're inventing,"" said Ilya, and looked attentively at Jakov.","""They're not my words,"" answered Jakov, and stretched out his hands as though to catch something in the air.","""I don't believe that it is in the Bible; perhaps he made it up, the old fox.","I asked him once and twice, and each time he said the words the same as before exactly.","And there's something in the words sounds right; we must have a look and see if it really is in the Bible.""","He bent towards Ilya and went on in a low voice: ""Take my father, for instance, how peacefully he lives, and yet he does things fit to rouse the anger of God.""","""How?""",cried Ilya.,"""Now they've elected him town councillor.""","Jakov let his head fall on his breast, sighed deeply, and said again: ""Everything that concerns man ought to be as clear as spring water to the conscience, and here----Oh!",it disgusts me.,I don't know any longer what to think.,I don't know how to fit myself for this life.,I don't want to.,"Father's always on at me, 'it's time,' he says, 'to stop your child's play, you must be reasonable at last, and make yourself useful.'",But how can I make myself useful.,"I wait behind the counter often when Terenti isn't there, and though I hate it, I do it anyway.","But to start something for myself, I don't know how.""","""You must learn,"" said Ilya decidedly.","""Life is so difficult,"" said Jakov softly.","""Difficult for you?","don't talk nonsense,"" cried Ilya, and sprang from his bed and went over to his friend, who was sitting at the window.","""My life is difficult if you like, but yours, what do you want?","When your father's old or dead, you'll take over the business, and be your own master, but I--I fag about the streets all day long and see in the shop windows stockings and vests, and watches, and all sorts of things, and I look at myself and think, I can't buy a watch like that.",D'you understand?,"And I should like to ever so much, but what I want most is for people to respect me.",Why am I worse than the rest?,"I'm better, really!","Perhaps I'm a rascal, eh?","I know people who think no end of themselves and are just rascals, and they get elected town councillors.","They've houses and inns; why do such swindlers have all the luck, and I none?","I'll get on, too.","I'll get hold of my luck.""","Jakov looked at his friend and said quietly, but with emphasis: ""God grant that you never get your luck!""","""What!","why?""","cried Ilya, and stood still in the middle of the room and looked angrily at Jakov.","""You're too greedy, you'll never get enough.""",Ilya laughed drily and evilly.,"""I'll never get enough?","Just tell your father to give me half the money he and my uncle stole from old Jeremy, that'll be enough!","Yes--I'm greedy am I?--and your father first.""",Jakov got up and went quietly with bowed head to the door.,Ilya saw his shoulders twitch and his head bend as though he had received a painful blow in the neck.,"""Stop,"" cried Ilya, confused, and grasped his friend's hand.","""Where are you going?""","""Let go, brother,"" half whispered Jakov, then stood still and looked at Ilya.","His face was pale, his lips pressed together and his whole figure bowed as though by a heavy load.","""Oh!","don't be angry, stay a minute,"" said Ilya, penitent, and led Jakov from the door back to his chair.","""Don't get cross with me--it's true, anyhow.""","""I know.""","""You know?","Who told you?""","""Everybody says it.""","""H'm--yes; but those who say it are rascals too.""",Jakov looked at him mournfully and sighed.,"""I didn't believe it; I thought all the time they said it just out of meanness, out of spite.","But then, I began to believe, and if you say it, too--then----"" He made a gesture to express his despair, turned away and stood motionless, his hands grasping the chair, and his head sunk on his breast; Ilya sat on his bed in the same mood and said nothing, for he did not know how to comfort his friend.","Behind the wall there was outcry and noise, till the glasses rattled and the voice of a drunken woman sang:     ""I cannot sleep, I cannot rest,     For slumber will not come to me.""","""And this is where one has to live!""","said Jakov, half aloud.","""Oh yes!""","answered Ilya, in the same tone, ""I can easily understand, brother, that you don't like it here.","The only consolation is, it's the same everywhere, men are all alike in the long run.""","""Do you know that really for a fact; that about my father and Jeremy?""","asked Jakov timidly, without looking at his friend.","""I?",I saw it myself; do you remember how I ran out?,"I looked through a chink and saw them sewing up the pillow--the old man was still gasping.""",Jakov shrugged his shoulders and said nothing.,"They sat in silence for a long time, both in the same position, one on the bed, the other on the chair.","Then Jakov got up, went to the door, and said to Ilya, ""Good-bye.""","""Good-bye, brother--take it easy; what can you do after all?""","""I?","Nothing, unfortunately,"" said Jakov, as he opened the door.","Ilya looked after him, then sank heavily on his bed.","He was sorry for Jakov, and again hatred welled up in him against his uncle, against Petrusha, against all mankind.","He saw that a being as weak as Jakov could not live among them, such a good, quiet, clean-minded fellow.","Ilya let his thoughts run freely over men and in his mind different memories rose up showing him mankind as evil, horrible, lying creatures.","The times, in truth, were many in which he had seen them so, and it relieved him to let his scorn loose on them; and the blacker they seemed to him, the heavier weighed on him a strange feeling, partly a vague desire, partly a malignant joy at other's suffering, partly a fear at remaining so alone in the midst of this dark wretched existence, that raged round him like a mad whirlpool.","Finally he lost patience at lying alone in the little room, where the noise and reek pressed through the wall, and he got up and went out in the open.","Till late that night he roamed the streets, bearing the heavy load of dull torturing thought.","He felt as though even behind him in the darkness, some enemy strode and pushed him imperceptibly to all places that were wearisome and melancholy.",All that his unseen enemy showed him roused rancour and bitterness in his soul.,"There is good in the world, good men, and happy events, and cheerfulness; why did he see nothing of this, but come in contact only with what was gloomy and evil?","Who guided him constantly to the soiled, the wretched, and the wicked things of life?","In the grip of his thoughts he strode through the fields along the stone wall of a cloister outside the town, and looked about him.",Heavy and slow the clouds drifted towards him out of a vast dim distance.,"Here and there above his head the sky glimmered between the dark masses of cloud, and little stars looked shyly down.",From time to time the metallic tones of the bell rang through the still night from the tower of the cloister church; it was the only sound in the deathly quiet that enfolded the earth.,"Even from the dark mass of houses behind Ilya came no sound of noisy bustle, though it was not yet late.","It was a cold, frosty night.",As he walked Ilya's feet struck the frozen mud.,"An uneasy sense of isolation and the fear that his brooding evoked, brought him to a standstill.","He leaned his back against the stone cloister wall, and thought again who it might be who guided him through life, and full of mischief let loose on him always evil and hateful things.","A cold shudder ran through his frame, and almost with a premonition of something awful before him, he started from the wall and hurried back to the town, stumbling more and more often over the frozen mud.","His arms pressed close to his sides, he ran forward, and full of fear did not once dare to cast a look behind.",XI.,Two days later Ilya met Pashka Gratschev.,"It was evening, little flakes of snow danced in the air and glimmered in the light of the lamps.","In spite of the cold, Pavel wore nothing thicker than a cotton shirt, without a belt.","He walked slowly, his head on his breast, his hands in his pockets, and his back bent as though he were looking for something.","When Ilya stopped him and spoke to him, Pashka raised his head, looked into Ilya's face, and said indifferently: ""Oh, it's you!""","""How goes it?""","asked Ilya, falling into step.","""It's just possible things might be worse.","And you?""","""Oh, rubbing along.""","""Not very grandly, it seems.""","They walked along together silently, their elbows touching.","""Why didn't you come to see us?""",asked Ilya.,"""I'm always inviting you.""","""No opportunity, brother.","You know people like us don't get much time.""","""You could come if you wanted to.""","""Don't be cross.","You're always saying I ought to come, and for all that, you've never asked me where I live, much less thought of paying me a visit.""","""You're right; it's a fact!""","said Ilya, laughing.","""But tell me now.""","Pavel looked at him, laughed too, and went on more cheerfully: ""I live for myself.","I've no friends, can't find any who can put up with me.",I've been ill--three months in hospital.,"Not a soul came to see me all the time.""","""What was wrong?""","""Caught cold once, when I was drunk.",Typhus it was.,"When I was better, that was the worst.",I lay alone all day and all night.,"You feel dumb and blind, like a puppy they throw into a pond.","Thanks to the doctor, I had some books at least, else I should have been bored to death.""","""Were they nice books?""",asked Ilya.,"""Ye-es, they were jolly good, mostly poems--Lermontov, Nekrassov, Pushkin.","Lots of times, reading was like drinking milk.","Verses, brother!",To read verses is like your sweetheart kissing you.,"A line sometimes goes through your heart and makes the sparks fly--you feel on fire.""","""And I've given up reading books,"" said Ilya, with a sigh.","""Why?""","""Oh, what's the good of them, after all?","You read books, and things seem to go one way, and you look at the real thing, and it's all different.""","""You're right there!",Shall we turn in anywhere?,We might have a bit of a talk.,"There's somewhere I must go, but there's plenty of time.","Perhaps you'll come along?""",Ilya agreed and took Pashka's arm.,"Pavel looked him in the face, and said, smiling: ""We were never really friends, but I'm always very glad to meet you.""","""That's your look-out,"" said Ilya, jokingly.","""Don't be glad on my account.""","""Ah, brother,"" Pavel interrupted him, ""it's all very well to joke!",I had something very different in my mind when you stopped me.,"But never mind that.""","They entered the first public house they came to, sat down in a corner and ordered some beer.",Ilya saw in the lamp-light that Pavel's face was thin and sunken.,"His eyes had a restless look, and his lips, that so often before were half-open in gay mockery, were now pressed close together.","""Where are you working now?""",asked Ilya.,"""In a printing works again,"" said Pavel, gloomily.","""Hard work?""","""Oh, no; more play than work.""","Ilya felt a vague pleasure to see Pashka, once so gay and assertive, now sad and careworn.","He wanted to find out what had changed his friend, and, filling Pashka's glass, began to question him.","""Well, and how does the poetry get on?""","""I let it alone now.",But I made a lot of poems a while ago.,"I showed them to the doctor, he praised them.",He got one of them printed in a paper.,"I got thirty-nine kopecks for it.""","""Oho!""",cried Ilya.,"""That's something like!",What sort of verses were they?,"Let's hear them!""",Ilya's eager curiosity and a couple of glasses of beer brought Gratschev into the right mood.,His eyes shone and his yellow cheeks reddened.,"""What shall I say to you?""","he said, rubbing his forehead.","""I've forgotten it all; by God, I've forgotten it.","Wait, perhaps something'll come back to me.","I've always a head full of this sort of stuff, like a swarm of bees inside, humming.","Often when I sit down to compose, I'm in a fever, something boils away in my soul and tears come into my eyes.""","""I say!","How does that happen?""","asked Ilya, astonished and suspicious.","""Oh!","something burns and blazes in you, and you want to express it cleverly and you can't find words, and then it makes you rage.""","He sighed, shook his head, and went on: ""Before it comes out, it seems tremendous, and when it's written down, it's nothing.""","""Say a verse or two now.""","The more closely Ilya observed Pavel, the keener grew his curiosity, and following the curiosity another warm, friendly, and at the same time sorrowful feeling.","""Generally I make funny poems, about my own life,"" said Gratschev, and laughed constrainedly.","""All right, say a funny poem.""","Gratschev looked round, coughed, rubbed his chest, and began to declaim hurriedly, in a dull voice, without looking at his friend:     ""It is night, and so sad--but piercing the gloom,     The moon throws its beams into my little room.","It beckons and laughs in the friendliest way     And paints a blue pattern so cheerful and gay,     On the dull stone wall, that is damp and so cold,     And over the carpet, all tattered and old.","I sit there, fast bound by the spell of my thought     And sleep never comes, though it's longed for and sought.""","Pavel paused, sighed deeply, then went on more slowly, and in a lower voice:     ""Grim fate has close gripped me in shuddering pain,     It tears at my heart, and it strikes at my brain;     It robbed me of all, when it caught at my dear,     And leaves me for comfort--this brandy-flask here.","See there, where it stands and gleams through the night,     And beckons and smiles in the moon's faint light.","The brandy shall heal me, my heart shall be well,     It shall cloud o'er my brain with the power of its spell.","Thoughts vanish in vapour, see, sleep is at hand,     Another glass, come!",and all trouble is banned.,"I drink yet again--who sleeps can endure,     I build against trouble a stronghold sure.""","As Gratschev ended, he looked inquiringly at Ilya, then let his head fall lower and said softly: ""That's the kind of thing generally--you see, it's silly enough.""","He drummed on the edge of the table with his fingers, and shifted his chair uneasily to and fro.","For a moment, Ilya looked at him with a searching glance and his face expressed incredulous astonishment.","The bitter, smooth running lines yet rang in his ears, and it seemed to him hardly credible that this thin beardless lad, with restless eyes, in an old cotton shirt and heavy boots, should have composed this poem.","""Well, brother, I shouldn't call that silly,"" he said slowly and thoughtfully, while he still looked curiously at Pavel.","""On the contrary, it's beautiful, it touched my heart--say it again, will you?""","Pavel raised his head, looked delightedly at his listener, and coming closer, asked in a whisper, ""No--really--do you like it?""","""Good Lord, what a queer fellow you are.","I shouldn't lie to you.""","""Well, I'll believe you, you're honest; you're straight, anyhow.""","""Say it again!""","Pavel softly declaimed it in melancholy tones, often stammering and sighing deeply when his voice failed him.","When he had finished, Ilya's suspicion was strengthened, that Pavel was not really the author of the verses.","""And the others?""",he said to Pavel.,"""Ah!","do you know,"" said the other, ""I'd rather bring my book to you, for most of my poems are long, and I haven't any time now.","I can't remember them properly, the beginnings and ends get muddled up; there's one ends like this: I'm going through the wood at night, and I've lost my way and I'm tired--yes, and then I get frightened, it's so quiet all round.","I am alone and now I'm looking for some escape from my misery and I lament:     ""My feet are heavy,     My heart is weary,     No way is clear;     O Earth my mother,     Guide me and tell me     What course to steer.","Anxious I nestle,     Close to thy bosom;     I listen, I peer--     And out of the dark depths     Comes a soft whisper--     'Hide thy grief here!'""","""Not so bad, eh?",That's the way of things.,"One goes, as it were, through a break in a forest, sees a light all of a sudden, then finds no way that'll lead to it.","Listen, Ilya.",Will you come with me?,Come!,"I don't want to say good-bye yet.""","Gratschev got up suddenly, caught Ilya by the sleeve, and looked in his face in a friendly way.","""I'll come,"" said Ilya.","""I'd like some more talk with you.","To tell the truth, I hardly know how to believe you made those verses yourself.""","""You don't believe?",Doesn't matter.,"You'll see right enough that I did,"" said Pavel, as they came out into the street.","""If they are your verses, then you're a fine fellow,"" cried Ilya, in downright bewilderment.","""Only stick to it!","Show people what life is really like!""","""Right, brother.","Once I've learnt properly how, then I'll write.","They shall hear it.""","""Good!",good!,Plan it out well!,"Let 'em know!""","""Often I think, when things are quiet, 'Ah, you people, you're full and warmly clothed, and I----'"" ""It's not fair.""","""Am I not a man too?""","""We're all equal.""","""He who walks in brave attire     Also eats and drinks his fill,     But he whose only clothes are rags     Has an empty stomach still.""","""Ah, the hypocrites!""","""Yes, they are hypocrites, all the lot!""","They strode quickly through the streets, and caught up eagerly the passionate scattered words each threw to the other.",The more excited they became the closer together they walked.,"Each felt a deep pure joy that the other thought as he did, and the joy heightened their mood still further.","The snow, falling in great flakes, melted on their glowing faces, settled on their clothes, clung to their boots.",They marched on through a thick slush that settled noiselessly on the earth.,"""I see the state of things quite clearly,"" cried Pavel, in a tone of conviction.","""One can't go on living like this,"" Ilya seconded him.","""If you've ever been to the High School, then you're reckoned a gentleman, even if your father was a water-carrier.""","""That's it; and how can I help it that I didn't go there, eh?""","""They're to have all the learning, and I--I'm to have nothing!""","cried Gratschev, full of wrath.","""Just wait a bit!""","""Oh, curse it!""","cried Ilya, who that moment stepped into a mud puddle.","""Keep more to the left.""","""Where are we going, anyhow--to the hangman?""","""To Sidorisha.""","""Where?""","""To Sidorisha.","Don't you know her?""","""N--no,"" said Ilya, after a moment's pause, and took two or three steps onward.","""It's a good long way, we're going.""","""Oh!""","said Pavel quietly, ""I must go, I've something to do.""","""Oh!",don't mind me!,"of course, I'll come too.""","""I'll tell you Ilya, though it's hard to speak of it.""",He spat into the road and was silent for a moment or two.,"""What is it?""","asked Lunev, pricking up his ears.","""You see,"" began Pavel, hesitatingly, ""it's about a girl.","Well, you'll see her.","She can search a fellow's heart; she was a servant at the doctor's house, who cured me.",I got books from him after I was better.,"I'd go, and then I'd have to sit in the kitchen and wait, and she was there skipping about like a squirrel and laughing; for me, I was like a wood shaving in the fire.","Well, we were alone, things went quickly, without many words.",Ah!,the happiness!,as if heaven had come down to us.,I flew to her like a feather into the fire; we kissed till our lips smarted.,Ah!,she was as pretty and dainty as a toy.,"If I caught her in my arms, she seemed to disappear.","She was like a little bird that flew into my heart and sang and sang there.""","He stopped, and a strange sound like a sob came from his lips.","""And what then?""","asked Ilya, carried away by the story.","""The doctor's wife surprised us, devil take her!","She was pretty too, and used to speak quite kindly to me before, but now of course, there was a scene.","Vyerka was turned out of doors and I with her, and they blackguarded us both horribly, my word!",Vyerka stayed with me.,I hadn't any work and we starved and sold everything to the last thread.,But Vyerka is a girl of spirit.,"She went off--was away a fortnight and came back dressed like a swell lady--bracelets, money in her pocket.""","Pashka ground his teeth and said gloomily: ""I thrashed her, I tell you.""","""Did she run away?""",asked Ilya.,"""N--No!",If she'd left me I'd have thrown myself in the river.,"'Kill me if you like,' she said 'but let me alone!",I know I'm a burden to you.,"No one shall have my soul,' she said.""","""And what did you do?""","""Do?","I struck her once more, then I cried.","What could I do; I can't find food for her.""","""Why didn't she find a new place?""","""The devil knows.","She said, 'it would be better this way.'","If children came, what could we do with them, and so----"" Ilya thought for a little, then said: ""A sensible girl.""",Pashka went on a step or two in silence.,"Then he wheeled sharp round, stood in front of Ilya, and said in a dull hissing voice: ""When I think that other men kiss her, then it's like molten lead driving through my limbs.""","""Why don't you let her go?""","""Let her go?""",cried Pavel in the highest astonishment.,Ilya understood afterwards when he saw the girl.,They came to a one-storied house on the outskirts of the town.,Its six windows were fast shut with thick shutters so that the house had the look of an old straggling granary.,"The wet, sloppy snow clung to roof and walls, as though it would conceal or smother the house.","Pashka knocked at the door and said: ""This is where they're looked after.",Sidorisha gives her girls board and lodging and takes fifty roubles from each of them for it; she has only four altogether.,"Of course she keeps wine too, and beer, and sweetmeats, and all that you want, for the rest she lets the girls do what they want to, go out if they like, or stop at home if they like, only pay the fifty every month.","They are all jolly girls; they make money as easily as----One of them, Olympiada, never takes less than four roubles.""",There was a rustling the other side of the door.,A yellow streak of light quivered in the air.,"""Who is there?""","""I, Vassa Sidorovna--Gratschev.""","""Oh!","The door opened and a little dried-up old woman, with a big nose in her shrivelled face, held the candle up to Pavel's face, and said in a friendly way: ""Good evening, Pashka.","Vyerunka has been waiting for you for a long time, and is quite cross.","Who's that with you?""","""A friend.""","""Who is it?""","came a pleasant voice out of a long, dark corridor.","""A visitor for Vyera,"" said the old woman.","""Vyera, here's your sweetheart,"" cried the same clear voice, ringing through the corridor.","At once at the end of the passage a door opened and the dainty figure of a girl, dressed in white, appeared in the bright patch of light, with her thick fair hair streaming round her face.","""How late you are!""","she said, in a deep alto voice, pouting.","Then she stood on the tips of her toes, put her hands on Pavel's shoulders, and looked at Ilya out of her soft brown eyes.","""This is my friend, Ilya Lunev.","I met him, and that's how I'm a bit late.""","""Welcome,"" she said, giving Ilya her hand, so that the wide sleeve of her loose white dress fell back almost up to the shoulder.","Ilya pressed her hot, dry little hand respectfully, without a word.","He looked at Pavel's sweetheart, with that feeling of joyful surprise with which a man greets a slender fragrant birch-tree in a thick wood full of brambles and marshy thickets.","As she stood aside to let him enter, he stepped back, bowed, and said politely: ""Please, after you.""","""How polite!""",she laughed.,"Her laughter was pleasant, gay and clear.","Pavel laughed too, and said: ""You've turned his head already, Vyerka.","See, how he stands there, like a bear in front of the honey jar.""","""Is that true?""","asked the girl, mischievously.","""Of course,"" answered Ilya, laughing.","""I'm quite bewildered by your beauty.""","""Here, you, listen!","You just fall in love with her and I'll kill you,"" Pavel threatened, jokingly.","It pleased him that his lady's beauty should make such an impression on his friend, and his eyes shone with pride as he looked at her.","She, too, paraded her charms with a naïve coquetry, convinced of their power.","She wore nothing but a bodice with sleeves, over a vest and a shining white petticoat; her healthy, sound, snow-white body showed through the bodice-opening.","A childish, self-contented smile twitched at the corners of her red lips; it was as though she took pleasure in herself, like a child with a toy it is not yet tired of.",Ilya could not take his eyes off her.,"He saw how gracefully she moved up and down in the room, and how she wrinkled up her little nose, and laughed and chattered, and looked tenderly at Pavel every now and then; his heart was heavy to think he had no such friend.",He sat silently and looked about him.,"A table covered with a white cloth, stood in the middle of the little, tidy, brightly-lighted room; on the table the samovar bubbled cheerily, and everything round about it was fresh and gay; the cups, the wine-bottle, the plate with bread and sausage--everything had a clean new look; it struck Ilya as unusual, and moved him to envy Pavel, who sat there, quite blissful, and began to rhyme extempore:     ""The sight of you, like bright sunshine,     Streams over this poor heart of mine.","Forgotten all my grief and pain,     My heart begins to hope again.","To call a beautiful girl one's own     Is the greatest joy that can ever be known.""","""Pashka, dear, how nice it is!""","cried Vyera, delighted.","""Ah!",it's hot!,"Hullo, you there, Ilya, leave off!",Can't you look enough?,"Get one for yourself!""","""But she must be pretty,"" said Vyera, with a strange emphasis, looking Ilya in the eyes.","""Prettier than you can't be found,"" sighed Ilya, and laughed.","""Don't talk of things you don't understand,"" said Vyera, softly.","""He knows his way about,"" said Pashka.","Then, turning to Ilya, went on, wrinkling his brow: ""Here, now, everything is so clean and jolly, and then, all of a sudden--one thinks--It cuts one's heart.""","""Don't think then!""","cried Vyera, and bent over the table.","Ilya looked at her, and saw how her ears grew red.","""You must think--"" she went on, softly but firmly--""if I have only a day, still it's mine!","It isn't easy for me, either, but I don't mix up the joy and the trouble; I keep it, like the song says: 'The sorrow I alone will bear, the joy together we shall share.'""","Pavel listened, but hardened his heart, in his sulky mood.","Ilya longed to say something comforting, encouraging, and, after a pause, began: ""What's to be done when the knots won't be loosened?","If I had lots of money, a thousand or ten thousand roubles, I'd give it to you, and say: 'There, take it, take it because of your love,' for I see it and feel it; for you it's a real true heart affair, and that is always pure to the conscience, and all the rest you can spit at.""",A warm feeling flamed up and thrilled through him.,"He stood up when he saw the girl lift her head and look at him gratefully, while Pavel smiled, as though he waited for him to say more.","""It's the first time in my life I've seen such a beautiful thing,"" Ilya went on.","""It's the first time I have seen how people can love one another; and, Pavel, it's the first time I've really got to know you--I've looked into your soul.","I sit here and say frankly, I envy you; I'm sad and merry at the same time.",God grant that all may be well with you!,"And--and as for the rest, let me say something.","Suppose--I dislike Chuvashai and Mordvij, they're dirty and blear-eyed.",But I bathe in the same river and drink the same water as they do.,Am I to avoid the river because they are objectionable?,Why should I?,"God cleanses it again.""","""That's it, Ilya!","You're a good fellow,"" cried Pavel, excitedly.","""But do you drink out of the river?""","said Vyera, softly.","""I must find it first,"" laughed Ilya.","""Pour me out a glass of tea to go on with, Vyera!""","""You're a nice boy!""",cried the girl.,"""Many thanks,"" said Ilya, seriously, bowed to her, and sat down again.",His words and the whole scene acted on Pavel like wine.,"His animated face reddened, his eyes shone with excitement, he sprang from his chair and paced the room joyously.","""Ah, devil take it!""","he cried, ""the world's a jolly place, if men are as simple as children.","It was a good thing I did when I brought you along, Ilya!","Drink, brother!","Fill up, Vyerunka!""","""Now there's no holding him,"" said the girl, and smiled at him tenderly.","Then, turning to Ilya, ""he's always like that, either as gay and shining as a rainbow, or dull, and grey, and cross.""","""That's not good,"" said Lunev decidedly.","Then all three began to chatter gaily and cheerfully, breaking into careless laughter every now and then.","There was a knock at the door, and a voice asked: ""Vyera, may I come in?""","""Come in!",come in!,"Ilya Jakovlevitsch, this is my friend, Lipa.""","Ilya rose from his chair, and turned towards the door.","A tall, stately woman stood before him, and looked in his face with calm blue eyes.","From her dress came a sweet perfume, her cheeks were fresh and red, and her head was adorned with a crown-like mass of hair that made her look even taller.","""I was sitting alone in my room, so bored, and then, all at once I heard you talking and laughing, and so--well, I came here.",You don't mind I hope?,There's a gentleman without a lady.,"I will entertain him--shall I?""","With a graceful gesture, she placed her chair near Ilya's, seated herself, and asked: ""You're rather bored with them, aren't you?","They kiss and hug one another, and you're envious, eh?""","""I'm not bored with them,"" said Ilya, confused by feeling her so near.","""That's a pity,"" she said quietly, then turned from Ilya and went over to Vyera.","""Just think, I went to Mass yesterday at the nunnery, and I saw such a pretty nun in the choir, such a dear.","I couldn't take my eyes off her, and thought why on earth did she go into the nunnery.","I felt quite sorry.""","""Why?","I shouldn't pity her,"" said Vyera.","""Oh!","Who's going to believe that!""","Ilya breathed in the costly perfume that floated round this woman, he looked sidelong at her and listened to her voice.","She spoke with extraordinary calm and self-possession, there was something drowsy in her voice and it seemed as though a powerful, delightful scent streamed from her words also.","""D'you know, Vyera, I'm still considering if I shall go to Poluektov or not.""","""I can't advise you.""","""Perhaps I will.","He's old and rich, and those are two important points.",But he's miserly.,"I want five thousand roubles in my name in the bank, and a hundred and fifty roubles a month, and he only offers three thousand and a hundred.""","""Don't talk of it now, Lipotshka!""","""All right, as you like,"" said Lipa, quietly, and turned again to Ilya.","""Now, young man, let us talk a little.","I like you, you've a nice face and serious eyes.","What will you say to that?""","""I?","I shan't say anything,"" said he, laughing carelessly, but feeling clearly how this woman ensnared him with her magic.","""Nothing?",oh!,"you're bored;--what are you?""","""Pedlar.""","""R--really?","I thought you were a clerk in a bank, or in some shop.","You look very good form.""","""I like cleanliness,"" said Ilya.","He felt oppressively hot, and his head was in a whirl with the perfume.","""You like cleanliness?--that's very nice.","Are you a good hand at guessing?""","""I don't understand.""","""Can't you guess that you're in the way here, eh;"" and she looked right through him with her blue eyes.","""Oh!",of course.,"I'll go,"" said Ilya confused.","""Wait a minute!","Vyera, may I take this youngster away?""","""Of course, if he wants to go,"" answered Vyera, laughing.","""But where?""","asked Ilya, in great excitement.","""Oh!","go along you silly fellow!""",cried Pashka.,"Ilya stood there dazed and laughed vaguely, but the beautiful lady took his hand and led him out, saying in her quiet way: ""You're not tamed yet, and I'm capricious and obstinate.","If I made up my mind to put out the sun, I'd climb on the roof and blow at it till I'd used my last breath.","Now you know what I'm like.""","Ilya went with her hand in hand, hardly hearing her words and not understanding at all: he only felt she was so warm, and soft and fragrant.",XII.,"His intimacy with Olympiada, so unexpectedly begun from a woman's whim, rendered Ilya at first quite arrogant.","A proud self-confident feeling awakened in him, healing the little wounds that life had dealt his heart.","The thought that a lovely well-dressed lady gave him her precious kisses out of pure affection and demanded nothing in return, raised him more and more in his own eyes, and he felt as though he were floating in a broad stream, borne along by a peaceful flood that caressed his body tenderly and waked strength and courage in his limbs.","""My dear lad,"" said Olympiada to him, as she played with his hair or passed her finger over the dark down that covered his upper lip.","""You're nicer every day, you've such a bold, confident heart, and I can see you're sure to get what you want.",I like that.,"I'm made that way, too.","If I were younger, I'd marry you and together we'd have a splendid time.""",Ilya treated her with great respect.,"She seemed so sensible, and he liked her for the way she respected herself in spite of her vicious life.",She never drank and used no foul words like the other women that he knew.,"Her body was as supple and strong as her full deep voice, and as tense as her character.","Even her frugality, her love of order and cleanliness, and the readiness with which she could speak on any subject and ward off anything that irritated her pride, delighted him.","Sometimes though, if he visited her and found her lying with dishevelled hair and pale, languid face, a bitter feeling of disgust would arise, and then as he looked gloomily into her wearied eyes he could bring no greeting from his lips.","She must have understood his feeling readily, for she would wrap the coverlet round her and say: ""Off with you!--go and see Vyera--tell the old woman to bring me some snow-water!""","He would go to the clean little room and Vyera would laugh guiltily at the sight of his gloomy, displeased face.","One day she asked him: ""Well, Ilya Jakovlevitsch, how are you getting on?","How do you like it here?""","""Ah, Vyerotchka, sin can't stick to you; if you only smile it melts away like snow.""","""I'm so sorry for you, both of you, poor fellows.""",Ilya liked Vyera very much.,"He treated her as a little child, was very disturbed if she quarrelled with Pashka, and made the peace between them every time.","He liked to sit in her room and watch her comb her golden hair, or sew at something, singing softly.","Often he surprised in her eyes a gnawing pain, and sometimes her face twitched with a hopeless weary smile.","At such a time he felt even more drawn to her, the misery of this little girl touched him more keenly and he would comfort her as well as he could.","But she said: ""No, no, Ilya, we can't go on like this, it's quite impossible; think--I--I must live on in this filth, but Pavel, what place is there for him near me?""","""But he chooses it,"" said Ilya.","""Chooses?""",came like an echo from her lips.,"Olympiada interrupted the conversation, entering noiselessly in a wide blue cloak, like a cold moonbeam.","""Come to tea, my lad, and you come in too, presently, Vyerotchka.""","Fresh and rosy from the cold water, clean, neat and calm, she took Ilya to her room without many words, and he followed, marvelling that this could be the same Olympiada he had seen before, faded and soiled by lustful hands.","While they drank their tea, she said to him: ""It's a pity you're only a peasant lad and have learned so little, that'll make it harder for you in life, but anyhow you must drop your present business and try something else.","Wait, I'll look out for a place for you--you must be looked after.","As soon as I've fixed things up with Poluektov, I'll manage it.""","""Is he going to give you the five thousand?""","""Of course,"" she answered with conviction.","""Well, if I ever meet him near you, I'll pull his head off,"" cried Ilya jealously.","""Why?","he doesn't get in your way.""","""He does, most decidedly, get in my way.""","""But he's old and horrid,"" said Olympiada, laughing.","""Laugh away!","I'll never believe that it's anything but a great sin to caress such a dirty beast.""","""Wait a little, at least, till I get hold of his money.""",The merchant did everything for her that she desired.,"Soon Ilya was sitting in her new house, seeing the thick carpets and the heavy plush-covered furniture, and listening to his lady's business-like remarks.","He found in her no special pleasure in her altered surroundings, she was as calm and self-contained as ever.","It was as though only the clothes were changed, nothing else.","""I am now twenty-seven,--when I am thirty, I shall have ten thousand roubles.","Then I'll throw over the old man and be free; learn from me, my lad, how to deal with life.""","Ilya learnt from her obstinate perseverance to attain a predetermined goal, but often the thought tortured him, that he shared her caresses with another, and a painful sense of degradation and weakness.","At such times the vision would rise again of his shop, with the clean room, where he might entertain his lady.","He didn't believe that he loved Olympiada, but she seemed quite necessary to him, as a sensible good comrade.","In this way, two months--three months passed away.","One day, when he returned home, he betook himself to Perfishka's cellar, and saw with amazement Perfishka at the table with a bottle of brandy, and opposite him, Jakov sat, leaning heavily on the table, his head swaying, and said unsteadily: ""Splendid!","If God sees everything and knows everything, then He sees me too.","Every one has forsaken me, brother.",I'm all alone.,"My father hates me, he's a scoundrel!","He's a robber and a cheat, isn't he, Perfishka?""","""Right, Jakov.","It's a pity, but it's true.""","""Well, then, how am I to live?","What am I to believe in?""","asked Jakov, stammering and shaking his dishevelled hair.","""I can't believe in my father.",Ilya goes his own way.,Masha is a child.,Where is there a man?,"Perfishka, I tell you, there's not a man left in the world.""","Ilya stood in the doorway, and heard his friend's drunken speech.",His heart sank painfully.,"He saw Jakov's head loll, drooping and weak, on his thin neck, saw Perfishka's thin, yellow face lighted up with a pleased smile, and he would not believe that this could really be Jakov, the quiet, modest Jakov.","""What are you doing here?""",he said reproachfully as he entered.,"Jakov started, looked with startled eyes into Ilya's face, and said, with a despairing smile: ""Ah, Ilya--is that all!","I thought--my father----"" ""What's all this about, tell me,"" Ilya interrupted.","""You let him alone, Ilya,"" cried Perfishka, and rose swaying from his chair.","""He can please himself.","Thank God that he still likes brandy.""","""Ilya,"" cried Jakov convulsively, ""my father thrashed me.""","""That's so.","I was a witness,"" explained Perfishka, and smote his breast with his fist.","""I saw everything.",I can take my oath!,"He knocked his teeth out, and made his nose bleed.""","In fact, Jakov's face was swollen and his upper lip covered with blood.","He stood in front of his comrade, and said, smiling mournfully: ""How dare he beat me?","I'm nineteen, and I'd done nothing wrong.""","""Why did he beat you, then?""","Jakov's lips twitched as though he was about to speak, but he said nothing.",His bruised face quivered.,"He sank heavily on a chair, took his head in his hands, and began to sob aloud, so that his whole body shook.","Perfishka, who had supported him as he sank down, poured out a glass of brandy, and said: ""Let him cry.",It's good when a man can.,"Mashutka, too, was in a state, quite bathed in tears.","'I'll scratch his eyes out,' she screamed right on, till I took her to Matiza.""","""But what happened?""","""I can tell you exactly.",It was quite a crazy business.,"Terenti, that uncle of yours, he began the thing.","All at once he said to Petrusha, 'Let me go to Kiev,' he said, 'to the holy men!'","Petrusha was delighted; that hump of Terenti's has worried his eyes, and to tell the truth, he's jolly glad to see Terenti's back; it's not nice to have some one about who knows a secret of yours--he!",he!,"'All right,' he says.","'Go along, and put in a little word for me too with the holy men.'","And then Jakov starts in all of a sudden: 'Let me go too,' he says.""","Perfishka began to roll his eyes, made a fierce grimace, and cried in a hoarse voice, imitating Petrusha: ""'Wha--a--at do you want to do?'""","""'I want to go with uncle to the holy men.'","""'What do you mean?'","""Jakov says, 'I could pray for you too.'","Then Petrusha begins to roar, 'I'll teach you to pray!'",Jakov sticks to his point.,'Let me go.,God is pleased with the prayers of sons for their fathers' sins.',"My word, how Petrusha hit him in the mouth, and again and again.""","""I can't live with him,"" cried Jakov.","""I'll go away.",I'll hang myself.,Why did he beat me--why?,"All I said came from my heart.""","Ilya's heart sank at this outcry, and with a despairing shrug of his shoulders, he left the cellar.",He was glad to hear that his uncle was going on a pilgrimage.,"Once Terenti was gone, he would finally leave this house, take a little room somewhere for himself, and be his own master.","As he entered his room, Terenti appeared, following him.","His eyes shone, his face wore an expression of joy.","He approached Ilya and said: ""Well, I'm going.","O Lord, how glad I am!","To step out of a cave, a cellar, into God's world.","Surely He will not despise my prayer, since He lets me get away from this place.""","""Do you know what's happened to Jakov?""","said Ilya, drily.","""What?""","""He's got drunk.""","""What do you say?",That is wrong of him!,Silly boy!,"And just now he was begging his father to let him go with me.""","""Were you there when his father beat him?""","""Yes, of course.","Why?""","""Why, can't you understand?","That's why he's got drunk.""","""Because of that?","It's not possible!""","Ilya saw clearly that Jakov's fate was a matter of indifference to his uncle, and that strengthened his feeling of enmity against the hunchback.","He had never seen Terenti so overjoyed, and the sight of this happiness, coming right after Jakov's misery, moved him strangely.","He sat down at the window and said: ""Go on into the bar.""","""Petrusha is there.","I want to talk to you.""","""Oh!","what about?""","The hunchback came up to him and said mysteriously: ""I'm getting away.","You're staying behind and that means--well----"" ""Hurry up,"" said Ilya.","""Yes--yes, I want to; it isn't easy to say,"" said Terenti, in a subdued way, while his eyes blinked.","""Do you want to talk about me?","eh?""","""Yes--yes--about you, too, but presently.","I've saved some money.""",Ilya looked at him and laughed maliciously.,"""What d'you mean?","Why d'you laugh?""","cried his uncle, frightened.","""Oh, nothing.","Well, then, you've _saved_ some money, have you?""","Ilya emphasised ""saved.""","""Yes, that's it,"" said Terenti, avoiding his look.","""I shall give two hundred roubles to the monastery.""","""O!""","""And a hundred to you.""","""A hundred?""","asked Ilya, suddenly, and at once he knew that in his soul for a long time the hope had lived that his uncle would give him not a hundred roubles, but a much bigger sum.","He was angered against himself that his heart could entertain so hateful, calculating, an expectation, and against his uncle that the sum was so small.","He got up, straightened himself, and said, full of scorn and insolence: ""I'll have none of your stolen money, d'you understand.""","The hunchback recoiled in fear and sank on his bed, pale and wretched, his hair bristled, his mouth stood open, and he gazed at Ilya silently with stupid terror in his eyes.","""Well, why do you look like that?","I don't want your money.""","""Christ!""",Terenti groaned hoarsely.,"""Why not, my dear, why not?","Ilusha, you've been like a son to me.""",Then presently he went on in a whisper.,"""It was just--for you--for fear of what should happen to you, that I took the sin on my soul; take the money, take it, else the Lord won't forgive me.""","""So,"" cried Ilya, mockingly, ""you'll go to your God with an account book!",Oh!,you!,"did I ask you to steal old Jeremy's money; think what a good man he was you robbed!""","""Ilusha, you didn't ask to be born, either,"" said the uncle, and stretched out his hand to Ilya with an odd gesture.","""No, take the money, quietly, for Christ's sake, to save my soul; if I come back, then you'll get it all, and meantime take this, my dear boy.","God will not forgive my sins, if you don't take the money!""","He was actually begging, his lips quivered, and in his eyes was an expression of fear.",Ilya looked at him and could not determine if his uncle really distressed him or no.,"""Well, all right, I'll take it,"" he said at last, and went straight out of the room.","He was sorry that he had yielded finally, he felt degraded.",What was a hundred roubles to him after all?,What big thing could he undertake with that?,"If his uncle had given him a thousand roubles now instead of a hundred, then he would have been enabled to change his dull uneasy life into a better, that should glide along in peaceful solitude far from mankind.","How would it be to ask his uncle, just how much he had obtained from the rag-picker's hoard?",But this thought was too repugnant to him.,Ever since Ilya had made Olympiada's acquaintance the house of Filimonov appeared to him dirtier and stuffier than ever.,"The dirt and the close atmosphere roused in him a physical nausea, as though cold, slimy hands were laid on his body.","To-day this feeling was more painful than usual, he could find no spot in the house to suit him, and, without any definite motive, he climbed the stairs to Matiza's garret.","As he went, he felt as though this house would somehow, at some time or other, deal him an unexpected terrible injury.",Busy with such thoughts he entered Matiza's room and saw her sitting on a chair beside her bed.,"She cast a glance at him, warned him with a finger, and whispered in a deep bass voice, like a far-off storm-wind: ""Sh!","She's asleep.""","Masha lay on the bed, huddled in a heap.","""What kind of a thing d'you call this?""","Matiza whispered, and rolled her big eyes angrily.","""Thrash children to ribbons, do they, the cursed villains!",to lay hands on children!,curse them!,"the scoundrels!""","Ilya stood by the stove and listened, while he gazed at the delicate form of the cobbler's daughter, wrapped in a grey shawl.","""What's to become of the poor things?""",rang in his head.,"""D'you know that the blackguard struck Masha, too?""",went on Matiza.,"""Tore her hair, the cursed scoundrel, the old bar loafer!","Beat his son, and the girl, and he's going to turn them both out of doors, d'you know that?","Where are they to go, poor orphans?","How----"" ""Perhaps I can find her a place,"" said Ilya, thoughtfully, remembering that Olympiada needed a housemaid.","""You!""","whispered Matiza, reproachfully.","""You come in always now as if you were a fine gentleman.","You get on and grow for yourself like a young oak-tree, give no shadow and no acorns.",You might have done something for her long ago.,"Aren't you sorry for the child?""","""Wait a bit and don't jaw!""","said Ilya, crossly.","It was an excuse for him to visit Olympiada at once, and he asked: ""How old's Mashutka?""","""Fifteen!",Why?,What's her age got to do with it?,"She looks barely twelve, she's so slender and delicate.","Heaven knows, she's just a child still.","She's fit for nothing, nothing!",What is to become of her?,"It would be better if she never waked again till the last day.""",A vague cloud of ideas filled Ilya's head when he left the garret.,"An hour later he was standing before the door of Olympiada's house, waiting to be admitted.","He waited a long time in the cold, till at last from behind the door a thin, peevish voice asked: ""Who is there?""","""I----"" answered Lunev, not very clear who was speaking.","Olympiada's servant, a plump, pock-marked person, had a loud harsh voice, and always opened the door without question.","""Whom do you want?""",asked the voice again.,"""Is Olympiada Danilovna at home?""","The door opened suddenly, and a strong light fell on Ilya's face.","The lad fell back a step, half shut his eyes, and looked perplexedly at the door, as though what he saw appeared an illusion.","Before him, lamp in hand, stood a little old man, in a wide heavy dressing-gown, the colour of raspberries.","His head was all but entirely bald, only a thin crown of grey hair ran from one ear to the other, and on his chin a short thin grey beard quivered uneasily.","He looked at Ilya's face, and his keen, piercing eyes blinked evilly, and his upper lip, with its scanty hairs, twitched up and down.","The lamp shook and trembled in his thin, swarthy hand.","""Who are you, then?","Well, come in.","Who are you?""",Ilya understood.,He felt the blood mount to his head and an untoward feeling of disgust and wrath filled his heart.,"This was the rival who shared with him the favours of the stately, beautiful lady!","""I am--a pedlar,"" he said, in a dull voice, as he crossed the threshhold.","The old man winked at him with his left eye, and smiled.","His eyes were red with inflammation, without eyelashes, and instead of teeth, a couple of yellow, pointed pegs showed in his mouth.","""Oh, ho!","A pedlar, eh?","What sort of a pedlar?""","asked the old man, with a cunning smile, and held the lamp up to illumine Ilya's face.","""I deal in all sorts of little things--scent and ribbons, and so on,"" said Ilya, and hung his head.",A giddiness seized him and red spots danced before his eyes.,"""Oh, oh!",Ribbons and scent.,"Yes, yes!",Ribbons and laces to deck pretty faces.,"But what do you want here, my young pedlar?","Eh?""","""I want to see Olympiada Danilovna.""","""Eh, to see her?","What do you want of her, now?""","""I have to get some money for things she's had,"" Ilya brought out, with difficulty.",He felt an incomprehensible fear of this horrible old man and hated him.,"In his thin, soft voice and in his evil eyes lay something that penetrated within Ilya's heart and took away his courage, and cast him down.","""Money, eh?",A little debt.,"All right, my lad.""","Suddenly the old man took the lamp away from Ilya's face, put it down, brought his yellow, withered face close to Ilya's ear, and asked him softly, with another, cunning smile: ""Where's the bill?","Give me the bill.""","""What bill?""","said Ilya, recoiling, frightened.","""Why, from your master.",The bill for Olympiada Danilovna.,"You've got it, I suppose?",What?,Give it here!,I'll take it to her.,"Quick, be quick!""","The old man moved nearer, while Ilya retreated towards the door.",His mouth was dry with fear.,"""I have no bill,"" he said loudly in despair, feeling that something terrible must happen the next moment.","The tall, stately figure of Olympiada appeared behind the old man.","Calmly, without the trembling of an eyelash, she looked at Ilya over the head of the old man, and said in her measured way: ""What is the matter?""","""It's a pedlar, he says you owe him money; you've bought ribbons, eh?",and not paid for them?,He!,He!,"Well, here he is and wants his money.""","He paced with short steps to and fro and blinked suspiciously first at Olympiada, then at Ilya.","With a commanding gesture, she waved him to one side, put her hand in the pocket of her cloak, and said to Ilya in a severe tone: ""What is it?","Could you not come another time?""","""Quite right,"" squeaked the old man.","""Silly fool, isn't he?""","""Coming when he's least wanted--donkey!""",Ilya stood as though turned to stone.,"""Don't scream so, Vassili Gavrilovitsch, it doesn't sound well,"" said Olympiada, and turning to Ilya, ""How much?",three roubles forty kopecks isn't it?,"here, take it!""","""And now clear out!""",squeaked the old man again.,"""Allow me.",I'll bolt the door myself.,"I'll do it.""","He drew his dressing-gown round him, opened the door, and cried: ""Now then, go along!""","Ilya stood in the frost before the closed door, and stared stupidly at it.","He could not yet decide if all that he had just seen were reality, or a hateful dream.","In one hand he held his cap, in the other the money Olympiada had given him.","He stood there so long that he felt the frost round his head like a ring of ice, and his legs were stiff with cold.","Then he put on his cap, put the money in his pocket, tucked his hands into the sleeves of his overcoat, drew in his shoulders, and went slowly down the street with bowed head.",His heart seemed ice and in his head a couple of balls rolled here and there and knocked against his temples.,"Before his eyes swam the dusky face of the old man, the yellow skull illuminated by the cold lamp-light.","And the face of the old man smiled evilly, cunningly, triumphantly.",XIII.,"On the day following his encounter with Olympiada's aged lover, Ilya walked to and fro along the main street of the town, slowly and silently.","He did not call his wares as usual, but looked at his box gloomily, and hidden in his heart there lay immovable, a heavy leaden feeling.","He never ceased to see before him the scornful face of the old man, Olympiada's calm blue eyes and the gesture with which she had given him the money.","Sharp little snowflakes drove through the dry, frosty air, stinging his face like needles.","He had just passed a little shop, half-concealed in a niche between a church and the big house of a rich merchant.","Over the entrance hung an old rusty sign with the inscription: ""Bureau de Change.",W. G. Poluektov.,"Old gold and silver, ornaments for shrines, rarities of every kind, old coins.""","As Ilya passed the door, he thought he saw behind the window panes the old man's face, grinning and nodding at him mockingly.",He felt an irresistible desire to see the old man closer.,He easily found an excuse.,"Like all pedlars, he collected the old coins that came into his hands, and sold them to the money-changers at an advance of twenty kopecks to the rouble.",He had a few at that moment in his wallet.,"He turned back, opened the shop door boldly, went in with his box, took off his cap and said, ""Good-day!""","The old man was sitting behind a small counter, and at the moment removing the metal clasps from an eikon, loosening the little nails with a small chisel.",He was deep in his work.,"He shot a hasty glance at the lad as he came in, then turned again to his work, and said drily without looking up: ""Good day!","What can I do for you?""","""Did you recognise me?""",asked Ilya.,The old man looked at him again.,"""Perhaps.","What d'you want?""","""You buy old coins?""","""Show me.""","Ilya shifted his box towards his back, and felt for the pocket where he had his purse with the coins--his hand failed to find it; it trembled like his heart, which beat furiously with hate of the old man, fear of him, and a vague impulse to achieve something decisive.","Whilst with his hand he felt under the flap of his overcoat, he looked steadily at the little bald head of the money-changer, and a cold shiver ran down his back.","""Well, have you got them?""",the old man addressed him crossly.,"""One moment,"" answered Ilya softly.",At last he succeeded in getting out his purse; he went close up to the counter and shook the coins out on to it.,The old man gave one look at them.,"""That's all, eh?""","He took the silver coins up in his thin yellow fingers, and looked at them one at a time, murmuring to himself: ""Katherine the Second, Anna, Catherine, Paul, another Paul, a cross-rouble, a thirty-two piece.","H'm, who's to see what this is?","This is no good, it's all worn away.""","""But the size shows it's a quarter rouble,"" said Ilya, harshly.","""Fifteen kopecks you can have for it, no more.""","The old man pushed the coins aside, drew out the drawer of his till with a quick movement, and began to feel about in it.","A fierce, stabbing rage took possession of Ilya, piercing through him like a frost-cold iron.","He struck out with his arm, and his powerful fist caught the old man on the temple.","The money-changer fell against the wall and struck his head hard upon it, but braced himself with his breast against the counter, held fast to it with his hands and stretched out his thin neck towards Ilya.","Lunev saw the terrified eyes blinking in the dusky little face and the lips quiver, and he heard a penetrating, groaning whisper: ""My darling--my darling.""","""Ah!","you beast!""","cried Ilya in a low voice, and crushed the old man's neck with his hands in disgust.","He throttled and pressed him and began to shake him, while the old man's throat rattled, and he tried convulsively to get away.","His eyes filled with blood, became bigger and bigger, and gushed with tears.",His tongue protruded from his dark mouth and moved to and fro as though mocking the murderer.,"The warm saliva dropped on Ilya's hand, and a hoarse, whistling, gurgling sound came from the old man's throat.","The cold crooked fingers caught at Lunev's neck, but he clenched his teeth, threw back his head, and shook the frail body more fiercely and dragged it over the counter; he would not have loosed his hold on the yielding throat, had any one come behind him and struck him.","Filled with rigid fear and glowing hate, he saw Poluektov's dim eyes grow bigger and bigger, and still he gripped him more fiercely, more passionately, and ever as the old man's body grew heavier the weighty load on Ilya's heart was lightened.","At last he let go of the body and pushed it away, and the money-changer's corpse sunk slackly to the ground.","Now Lunev looked round him; the shop was deserted and still, behind the door in the street snow was falling thickly.","On the floor at his feet lay two pieces of soap, a purse, and a roll of ribbon.","He perceived that these objects had fallen from his box, picked them up and replaced them.",Then he leant over the counter and looked once more at the old man.,He was crumpled in the small space between the counter and the wall.,"His head hung down on his breast, nothing could be seen but the yellow, bald patch at the back of it.","Then Lunev looked at the open till--gold and silver coins shone back at him, packets of paper money met his eyes; he trembled with joy, hastily caught a packet, then a second and a third, stuffed them under his shirt, and looked once more anxiously round.","Carefully, without haste, he stepped back into the street, stopped three paces from the shop, covered his wares with the oil-cloth cover, and then went on in the midst of the thick snow that fell from invisible heights.","Round him, even as in him, floated a cold, misty cloud; his eyes strove to pierce it with tense alertness.","Suddenly he felt a dull pain in his eyes, he touched them with a finger of his right hand, and stood still, gripped by terror, as though his feet were suddenly frozen fast to the ground.","He felt as though his eyes were coming out of their sockets, like those of old Poluektov, and he feared lest they should remain for ever thus protruded, never to be closed, for all men to read in them the crime he had committed.",They felt as though they were lifeless.,"He touched the pupils with a finger, felt a sudden pain in them, and tried for a long time vainly to close the lids.",Fear caught the breath in his throat.,At last he managed to close them.,"He rejoiced at the darkness that suddenly enclosed him, and stood motionless, seeing nothing, breathing deep breaths of the cold air.",Some one ran against him.,"He looked quickly round, and saw a tall man, in a short fur coat, passing.",Ilya looked after the unknown till he vanished in the thick drifting snow.,"Then he straightened his cap and strode on, feeling still the pain in his eyes and a weight at his head.","His shoulders twitched, his fingers involuntarily clenched, and a daring boldness awakened in his heart and banished his fear.","He went on till the road divided, there saw the grey figure of a policeman, and went, as if by accident, slowly, quite slowly, straight up to him.",His heart stopped as he drew near.,"""Here's weather,"" said Ilya, going close to the policeman and looking boldly into his face.","""Ye--es!",Snowing pretty well!,"Thank heaven, it'll be warmer now,"" answered the policeman, with a good-natured expression on his big, red, bearded face.","""What's the time, by the way?""",asked Ilya.,"""I'll have a look.""","The policeman knocked the snow from his sleeve, and put his hand under his cloak.",Lunev felt both relieved and again made anxious by the proximity of this man.,"Suddenly he laughed, in a dry, forced way.","""What are you laughing at?""","asked the policeman, opening the front of his watch with his nail.","""If you could see yourself.","It's as though some one had tipped a cart of snow over you!""","""No need for that; it's coming down in bucketsful.","Just half-past one, all but five minutes.","Yes, brother, it's bad for men of my trade this weather.","You'll go into the public house, in the warm, and I must stick about here till six.","Oh, just see; your box is full of snow!""",The policeman sighed and snapped his watch to.,"""Yes, I'm off to the alehouse,"" said Ilya, with a forced laugh, and added, for no particular reason: ""That one, up there, that's where I'm going.""","""Don't chaff me!""","cried the policeman, sulkily.",In the alehouse Ilya took a seat near the window.,"From this window, as he knew, the church could be seen next to Poluektov's shop.",But now all was covered with a white curtain.,"Ilya watched attentively how the flakes slowly slid past the window and settled on the ground, covering the footsteps of the wayfarers as with a thick carpet.","His heart beat strongly and full of life, but easily.","He sat and waited for what should befall, and the time seemed to pass slowly.","When the waiter brought him tea he could not refrain from asking, ""Well, how goes the neighbourhood?","anything new?""","""It's got warmer, much warmer,"" answered the other quickly and hurried away.","Ilya waited and waited, he felt as though he were weary and fell into a doze.","He poured out a glass of tea, but did not drink it, sat still, and thought of nothing.","Suddenly he felt hot; he unbuttoned the collar of his overcoat, and shuddered as his hands touched his chin.",It felt as though these were not his hands but the strange cold hands of an enemy that had touched him.,"He held them up and observed his fingers attentively--his hands were clean, but the thought came to him that he must wash them very carefully with soap.","""Poluektov has been murdered!""",cried some one suddenly in the bar.,Ilya sprang up from his chair as though the cry had been addressed to him.,"But all the other customers also were in commotion and rushed to the door, pulling on their caps.","Ilya threw a ten-kopeck piece on the counter, slung his box over his shoulder, and followed in the same haste as the others.",Already a big crowd had collected before the shop of the money-changer.,"Policemen moved up and down, and full of officious zeal shouted at the people; the bearded one with whom Ilya had spoken was there too.","He stood in the doorway, keeping back the crowd that pressed towards it, regarded every one with troubled eyes, and passed his hand constantly over his left cheek that seemed redder than the right.",Ilya found a place near him and listened to the remarks of the crowd.,"Next him stood a tall, black-bearded merchant with a stern face, who listened with knitted brows to an old man in a fox-skin coat, who was relating in a lively way: ""The errand boy comes to the house and thinks his master has fainted.",He runs to Peter Stepanovitch.,'Ah!',"he says, 'come quick to our house, the master is ill.' Naturally Peter hurries off, and when he comes in he sees the old man is dead.",A pretty business!,"and think of the audacity, in broad day, in such a busy street, it's past belief!""","The black-bearded merchant gave a low cough, and said severely: ""It is the finger of God!","Evidently the Lord would not receive his repentance.""",Lunev pressed forward to look again at the face of the merchant and struck him with his box.,"The merchant called out, pushing him away with his elbow and regarding him angrily: ""Where are you coming with that box of yours?""","Then he turned again to the old man: ""It is written, 'not a hair falls from the head of a man except by the will of God.'""","""What's one to say?""","said the old man, and nodded in agreement: then he added, half aloud, his eyes twinkling, ""It is well known that God marks the wicked.","The Lord forgive me, it's wrong to speak of it, but it's difficult also to be silent.""","""And you'll see,"" went on the stern merchant, ""they'll never find the guilty one; mark my words.""",Lunev laughed right out.,The sound of this conversation seemed to send new strength and courage streaming through him.,"If any one at this moment had asked him: ""Did you murder him?""","he would have answered ""yes"" boldly and fearlessly.","With this feeling in his breast he pushed through the crowd, close up to the policeman.","The man looked at him, gave him a push on the shoulder, and said loudly: ""Now then, what are you doing here?","Be off!""",Ilya backed away and struck against a bystander.,"He received another push and a voice cried: ""Give him one over the head!""","Then he left the crowd, sat on the church steps and laughed in his heart at all these men.","He heard the snow scrunch under their feet and the muttered conversation, fragments of which reached his ears.","""Why must the rascal do his dirty work just when I'm on duty?""","""In all the town he took the biggest discount, he always was a thief.""","""It'll never stop snowing to-day, you can't see the shop at all.""","""He used to fleece his debtors properly.""","""He was a man after all--one can't help pitying him.""","""They're all greedy--think of nothing but their profits.""","""Look!","there's his wife.""","""Ah!","poor thing!""",sighed a ragged peasant.,"Lunev stood up and saw a stout, elderly woman in a loosely-fitting dress and a black veil, getting heavily out of a wide sledge covered with a bear's skin.",The police officer and a man with a red moustache helped her.,"""Ah!","my dear, my husband.""","As her trembling, frightened voice was heard, silence fell on all the bystanders.",Ilya looked at her and thought of Olympiada.,"""Where's the son?""","said some one, softly.","""He's in Moscow, they say.""","""He'll get the bad news soon enough.""","""That's true.""","Lunev heard, and his heart sank.","He preferred to hear that no one lamented Poluektov; although at the same time, he thought all these men stupid and unreasoning, except the black-bearded merchant.","This man had an air of strength and of firm faith, but the others stood like trees in a wood, and chattered in their silly way, pleased at the suffering of others.","He waited until the frail body of the money-changer was carried from the shop, and then went home, cold, tired, but calm.","Reaching home, he bolted himself in his room, and began to count his money: in two thick packets there were five hundred roubles in small notes, in the third packet, eight hundred and fifty roubles.",There was also a little bundle of coupons which he did not count.,"He wrapped all the money up in paper, and considered where to hide it.","As he thought, he felt that his head was heavy and that he was sleepy.","He determined to hide the money in the attic, and started out there, holding the parcel in his hand.",In the passage he met Jakov.,"""Ah, you're back,"" said Jakov.","""Yes, I'm back.""","""How pale you are.","Are you ill?""","""I'm not feeling up to much.""","""What have you got there?""","""What have----"" Ilya began; then suddenly he shivered in fear lest he should babble away his secret, and said hurriedly, swinging his parcel to and fro: ""It's ribbon, that's all, out of my box.""","""Coming to tea?""",said Jakov.,"""I?","Oh, yes, in a minute.""",He went quickly through the passage.,"He trod unsteadily, and his head was dizzy, as though he were drunk.","As he mounted the attic stairs, he went carefully, in constant fear lest he should make a noise or meet some one.","While he buried the money under the flooring, near the chimney, he thought all of a sudden that some one was hidden in the darkness in the corner, watching him; he felt a wish to throw a stone in that direction, but mastered his feelings, and came slowly downstairs again.",Now he had no fears.,"It was as though he had left them with the money; but a fresh doubt waked in his heart: ""Why did I kill him?""","Masha greeted him joyfully in the cellar, where she was busy at the stove with the samovar.","""Ah, how early you are to-day!""","""That's the snow,"" he said;

darling.""","The harsh voice of the black-bearded merchant, Masha's entreaty, the words of the heretic book, the pious talk of the preacher, all blended into one wild confused sound.","Everything

wall opposite the window that it was a clear, frosty day.","His head was dull and confused, but his heart was peaceful.","He recalled the events of yesterday, watched the course of his own thought and

contemplating the folk he met.",If he passed a church he took off his cap and crossed himself.,Even before the church near the closed shop of Poluektov he crossed himself and went on without a trace

o'clock.""","As Ilya read the words, he felt his body contract internally, and he shivered as if with cold.","Once more he saw the contemptuous expression on the face of his mistress, and in his ears rang her rough, insulting words: ""Couldn't you come some other time?""","He looked the letter all over, and could not determine why Olympiada had appointed this particular meeting place.","Then all at once, he feared to understand, and his heart beat fiercely.",He was punctual.,"The sight of Olympiada's tall figure among the many women who were walking, singly or in couples, near the public baths, increased his anxiety and restlessness.",She wore an old fur jacket and a veil.,He could only see her eyes.,He stood before her in silence.,"""Come!""","she said, and added, softly: ""Turn up your coat-collar!""","They walked through the passage of the building, keeping their faces turned aside, and disappeared quickly into a private room.","Olympiada quickly threw aside her veil, and Ilya took new courage at the sight of her calm face, its colour heightened by the cold.","Almost immediately he felt, however, that he disliked to see her so unmoved.","She sat down on the divan, and said, looking in his face in a friendly way: ""Well, my lad!","We'll soon appear together before the police?""","""Why?""","asked Ilya, and wiped the hoar frost from his moustache.","""How stupid you can seem!","As if you didn't know!""","cried Olympiada quietly, with a tinge of mockery.","Then her brows contracted, and she said, seriously, in a low tone: ""D'you know the police agent was at my house to-day.","What d'you say to that?""","Ilya looked at her, and said, drily: ""What's that to me?","Don't trouble me with your police, or anything else.","Tell me simply why you've brought me here, with all this precaution.""","Olympiada looked at him searchingly, then said, with a mocking laugh: ""Oh, you'll still play the innocent--but there's no time for that.",Listen.,"When the police officer

command.,"He felt an evil thought push up in him, that yet gave him pleasure.","He thought that Olympiada feared him, and he found in himself a desire to torture her.","He knit his brows and looked in her face with a furtive smile, but said nothing.","A spasm of fear twitched her features, and she stepped back a pace, pale, whispering softly: ""What is the matter?",Why do you look like that?,"Ilya, Ilya!""","""Tell me, why should I lie?""","he asked, showing his teeth scornfully.","""I have seen the old man at your house.""","Then, resting his elbows on the marble-topped table, he went on slowly and quietly, with a sudden access of bitter anger: ""I did see him once, and I thought: 'This is the man who stands in my way and has spoilt my life;' and if I did not strangle him then and there----"" ""Don't tell lies!""","cried Olympiada, loudly, and struck the table.","""It is a lie!","He was not in your way.""","""How was he not?""","""He did nothing to you.","You had only to wish it, and I'd have given him the go-by.","Didn't I tell you I'd show him the door right away, if you wanted it?",You smile there and you don't say anything.,You never really loved me.,It was your own choice to share with him.,"You worthless----"" ""Stop!","Be quiet!""",cried Ilya.,"He sprang up, but at once sat down again, as though the woman had crushed him by her accusation.","""I will not be quiet!""",she cried aloud.,"""I loved you because you were good-looking and wholesome; and you, what have you done to me?",Did you ever say: 'Choose--him or me!',Did you ever say it?,No!,"You were nothing but a love-sick tom-cat, like all the others.""",Ilya started at this insulting reproach.,"There was a darkness before his eyes, and with clenched fist he sprang up again.","""Stop!","How dare you?""","""You'll strike me, will you?","Well, then, do it!""",and her eyes flashed threateningly and she ground her teeth.,"""Strike me, and I'll tear the door open and cry out that you killed him and planned it with me.","Well, do it!""","For a moment Ilya was paralysed with fear, but the feeling only touched his heart and vanished at once.","Only he breathed with difficulty, as though unseen hands had him by the throat.","Again he sank back on the divan, was silent for a while, then gave a forced laugh.","He saw Olympiada bite her lips and look as if seeking something round the dirty room, full of a damp, soapy vapour.","Then she sat down on the divan close to the door, let her head fall, and said: ""Laugh away, you devil!""","""I will, certainly.""","""When I saw you, I said 'that's the man for me, he'll help me, save me.'""","""Lipa,"" said Ilya gently.",She sat motionless and did not answer.,"""Lipa,"" he repeated, and then with a sense as of hurling himself into an abyss, he said slowly, clearly: ""I did strangle the old man, by God!""","She shuddered, lifted her head and looked at him with wide eyes.","Her lips began to tremble and she stammered: ""Silly boy, how frightened you are!""","Ilya understood that it was she who felt the fear, and did not want to believe his words.","He got up, moved nearer, and sat down beside her, smiling vaguely.","She caught his head to her breast, and whispered in her deep voice, as she kissed his hair: ""Ilushka!",Ilushka!,Why do you hurt me so?,"I was so glad you killed him, the old sneak.""","""Yes, I did it,"" he said, and nodded his head.","""Sh!""","said the woman, anxiously.","""I'm glad he's out of the way.",That's what should happen to them all--all who ever touched me.,You are the only man I ever met.,"You are the first, my dear one.""",Her words drew him closer to her.,"He nestled with his face against her breast, till he could hardly breathe, but would not loosen his embrace, for he felt she was the only human being that was really near to him, and that more than ever now he needed her.","""When you stand there fresh and healthy, and look at me angrily, then I feel the degradation of my life, and I love you even for that, because of your pride.""","Great tears fell on Ilya's face, and as their falling moved him, over his own cheeks flowed a stream that freed his soul.","She took his head in her hands, kissed eyes and cheeks, and lips, and said: ""I know it's only my beauty holds you--your heart doesn't love me, and it condemns me.","You can't forgive me my life, and that old man.""","""Don't speak of him,"" said Ilya.",He dried his face with her kerchief and rose up calm.,"""Let come what may,"" he said slowly and firmly.","""If God means to punish, He finds the way.","I thank you, Lipa, for your words, what you say is right.",I am guilty towards you.,"I thought you were--only such a one as----and you are----forgive me dear!""",He stammered with dry lips and dim eyes.,"Slowly, he smoothed his disordered hair with a trembling hand, and said in a dull, hopeless way: ""I am guilty of everything.",Why?,Why?,Oh!,"Satan!""","""Olympiada caught his hand; he sank on the divan beside her and said, not heeding her whispered words: ""Do you understand?","I strangled him; do you believe it?""","""Sh!""","cried Olympiada, in an anxious muffled voice.","""What are you saying?""","She embraced him closely, and looked into his face with troubled eyes.","""Let me go!",it--it happened all of a sudden--God knows I didn't mean to do it.,"I only wanted to see his hateful face again, that's why I went into the shop.","I had no intention,--and then it came in a moment, the devil urged me and God did not hold me back.","I shouldn't have taken the money, that was silly, ah!""","He sighed deeply, and the hard rind of his heart seemed to loosen.","Olympiada was quivering at his story, she held him even closer and whispered brokenly, disconnectedly.","Presently she said: ""It was a good thing you took the money, they'll think now it was for robbery, and not for jealousy; that would be worse for us.""","""I don't feel sorry,"" said Ilya thoughtfully.","""I won't repent.",God may punish me!,Men are not my judges; what sort of judges would they be!,"I know no men without sin, not one.","I'll wait.""","""O God,"" stammered Olympiada.","""What is it?",What will happen?,"Dear, I'm quite stupid.","I can't think clearly--but let's go away from here--it's time.""",She stood up and swayed like a drunken woman.,"But when she had fastened her veil, she said of a sudden, quite calmly: ""What's going to happen, Ilya?","Will it go hard----?""",Ilya shook his head.,"""Tell the magistrate everything, just as it was; that is, not everything, but----"" ""I'll say it.","Do you think I won't stand up for myself, or that I want to go to Siberia for this old wretch and a matter of two thousand roubles?",No?,"I've something else to do with my life!""","His face was red with excitement, and his eyes shone.","She came close to him and said in a whisper: ""Did you really only take two thousand roubles?""","""Two thousand and a little more.""","""Poor boy; no luck

there's no need for us to hide; come soon.""",They parted with a long passionate kiss.,As soon as Ilya reached the street he hailed a droshky.,As he went he kept looking back to see if he were followed.,"His heart was lighter and a warm, tender feeling for Olympiada awaked in it.","By no word or look had she wounded him, when he made his confession, she had rather taken on herself a part of the guilt than thrust him away.","One minute before, when she did not know, she was ready to destroy him; he had read it in her face; then suddenly she had changed; he smiled gently as he thought of it.",Next day Ilya felt like the quarry that finds the huntsman on its track.,"Petrusha met him in the bar room early; he answered Ilya's greeting with a nod, and looked at him strangely, searchingly.","Terenti looked hard at him, sighed and said nothing, Jakov met him in Masha's room, and said with a terrified face: ""Last night the Ward Superintendent was here; he asked father all about you.","Why did he do that?""","""What did he ask about?""",said Ilya quietly.,"""Everything--how you live, if you drink brandy, if you go with women,--he mentioned some Olympiada; didn't you

have said everything exactly; there's nothing in all that, and it isn't risky.",Don't be anxious.,"I kiss you dearest.""",He threw the letter at once in the fire.,"In Filimonov's house as well as in the bar, the talk was all of the murder.",Ilya listened with a distinct sense of pleasure.,"He liked to pass near men who were discussing his deed, asking for details, which were invented freely, and thought with pleasure what profound amazement he could bring on them if he said: ""I did it--I!""","Some praised the cleverness of the criminal, some pointed out that he had failed to get all the money, some seemed to fear, lest he should yet be arrested, but not one single voice was heard to lament the victim, no one uttered on his account so much as a friendly word.","Ilya despised them that they had no pity for the merchant, though he himself had none.","He thought no more of Poluektov, only realising that he had taken a burden of guilt on himself and would be punished at some future time.","This thought, in the present, disturbed him not at all; he bound it into his conscience and it became a part of his soul.","It was like a bruise from a blow, it did not hurt if it were not disturbed.",He was deeply convinced that the hour must come when the vengeance of God would overtake him.,"God knows everything, and would not forgive the transgressor of His law: but this calm steady readiness to meet the punishment, any day, any hour, enabled Ilya to feel and behave as he did before the murder.","Only he watched men more closely, and traced their weaknesses more zealously.","This pleased him, though he realised that he was in no way exonerated thereby.","He was gloomier, more reserved, but from morning to night, as usual, he carried his wares about the town, visited alehouses, observed men, and listened to their talk.",One day he thought of the money he had hidden and wondered if he would conceal it elsewhere.,"But at once he said to himself: ""It's no good.",Let it be.,"If they look and find it, I'll confess.""","There was as yet no search after the money, and it was the sixth day before Ilya was summoned before the magistrate.","Before he went, he changed his linen, put on his best jacket, and brushed his boots till they shone.",He went in a sleigh.,It jolted over the uneven streets till he had difficulty in holding himself upright and motionless.,He felt his body so tensely strung that he feared to break something in him by a sudden movement.,"He mounted the steps of the Court House slowly and carefully, as though he were wearing clothes of glass.","The magistrate was a young man, with curly hair and a hooked nose, wearing gold-rimmed spectacles.","When he saw Ilya, he first rubbed his thin white hands, then removed his spectacles and polished the lenses with his handkerchief, looking the while at Ilya with his big dark eyes.",Ilya bowed silently.,"""Good-day!","Sit down there.""",He indicated a chair at a big table covered with a dull red cloth.,"Ilya sat down, carefully pushing away with his elbow a pile of legal documents lying at the edge of the table.","The magistrate noticed the movement, politely moved the papers, and sat down opposite Ilya.","Without speaking, he began to turn the leaves of a book, and measured Ilya with sidelong glances.",Ilya disliked the silence.,He turned away and looked round the room.,It was the first time he had seen a place so orderly and so richly furnished.,All round the walls hung framed portraits and pictures.,"In one Christ was represented, walking, lost in thought, His head bowed, alone and sad, among ruins.","Corpses of men and scattered weapons lay at his feet, and in the background, a dense black smoke rose up into the sky.",Something was burning.,"Ilya looked long at this picture, and tried to understand what it represented.",So much so that he was on the point of asking when suddenly the magistrate shut his book with a bang.,Ilya started and looked at him.,"The magistrate's face wore a weary, dull expression, his lips were depressed oddly at the corners, as though some one had hurt his feelings.","""Well,"" he said, and tapped the table with his finger, ""you are Ilya Jakovlevitch Lunev, aren't you?""","""Yes.""","""You can guess why I have summoned you?""","""No,"" answered Ilya, and took another fleeting look at the picture.","Then his eyes travelled over the solid, fine furniture, and he was conscious of the perfume the magistrate had been using.","It distracted his thoughts and calmed him to observe his surroundings, and envy rose in his heart.","""This is how distinguished people live.""",The thought went through his head.,"""It must be very profitable to catch thieves and murderers.","I wonder what he gets.""","""You can't guess?""",repeated the magistrate.,"""Has Olympiada said nothing to you?""","""No.","It's some time since I saw her.""","The magistrate threw himself back in his chair, and the corners of his lips went down.","""How long?""",he asked.,"""I don't know, eight or nine days perhaps.""","""Ah!",is that so?,"tell me, did you often meet old Poluektov at her house?""","""The old man who was murdered a little while ago?""","asked Ilya, and looked his questioner in the eyes.","""Yes, that's the man.""","""I never met him.""","""Never?""","""Never.""","The magistrate fired off his questions quickly with a certain nonchalance, and when Ilya, who answered very cautiously, was slow to reply, he drummed impatiently on the table with his fingers.","""You knew that Olympiada Petrovna was kept by Poluektov?""","he asked suddenly, and looked sharply through his spectacles.","Ilya reddened at the glance, which seemed in some way to wound him.","""No,"" he said in a dull tone.","""Oh!","yes, she was kept by him,"" repeated the magistrate, angrily,--""to my thinking that is not good,"" he added, as he saw Ilya about to answer.","""How should there be anything good in it?""","said Ilya softly, at length.","""True.""",But Ilya said no more.,"""And you--you've known her a long time?""","""More than a year.""","""You were intimate with her before her acquaintance with Poluektov?""","""You're a cunning fox,"" thought Ilya, and said quietly: ""How can I say, when I didn't know that she lived with the man that's dead.""","The magistrate drew his lips together and whistled, and began to finger the pile of documents.",Ilya looked again at the picture; he felt that his interest in it helped him to keep calm.,"From somewhere, the clear, gay laugh of a child came to his ear.","Then a happy, gentle, woman's voice sang tenderly: ""My Annie, my little one, my darling, my dear.""","""That picture appears to interest you greatly.""","""Where is Christ supposed to be going?""",asked Ilya.,"The magistrate looked in his face with a weary, disillusioned expression, and said after a pause: ""You can see.",He's come down to earth to see how men fulfil His commands.,"He's going over a battle-field--round about are dead men, houses destroyed, fire plundering.""","""Can't He see that from Heaven?""","""H'm, it's rather an allegory, it's represented like that, so as to be plainer, to show how little real life agrees with the teaching of Christ, that is----But come, I must ask you a question or two yet.""","Ilya turned from the picture and looked in the magistrate's face; a number of little unimportant questions followed, annoying Ilya like autumn flies.",He grew tired and felt his attention growing slack and his carefulness wither under the monotonous dull sound.,"He grew angry with the magistrate, who set these questions, as he well understood, on purpose to weary him.","""Can you tell me perhaps,"" said the magistrate quickly, apparently without any particular intent, ""where you were on Thursday between two o'clock and three.""","""In the ale-house; I was having tea.""","""Ah!",in which inn then?,"Where?""","""In the Plevna.""","""How is it you are so certain that you were there just at that time?""","The magistrate's face looked tense, he leaned over the table and stared into Ilya's face with flaming eyes.",Ilya did not reply at once.,"After a second or two he sighed and said with composure: ""Just before I went in, I asked the time of a policeman.""","The magistrate leaned back again, and began to tap his finger-nails with a blue pencil.","""The policeman told me it was twenty minutes to two, or something like that.""","""He knows you?""","""Yes.""","""Have you no watch?""","""No.""","""Have you ever before asked him the time?""","""Yes, it has happened.""","""The town hall is near, there's a clock.""","""One forgets to look, and then it was snowing.""","""Were you long in the Plevna?""","""Till the news came of the murder.""","""Where did you go then?""","""I went to look.""","""Did any one see you there, in front of the shop?""","""That policeman saw me, he sent me off--pushed me.""","""Very good, very important for you,"" said the magistrate approvingly, then asked at once without looking at Ilya: ""Did you ask the time before the murder or after?""",Ilya saw the drift of the question.,"He turned sharp round in his chair full of rage against this man with the shining white linen, the thin fingers, well-tended nails, and gold spectacles in front of piercing dark eyes.","Instead of answering, he asked: ""How can I tell?""","The magistrate coughed drily, and rubbed his hands till the fingers cracked.","""Well done,"" he said in a tone of displeasure.","""Splendid!--yes.""",And he shifted his chair as though tired.,"""Very good; one or two questions now and I'll let you go.","Do you know, by any chance, that policeman's name?""","""Jeremin, Matvey Ivanovitch.""",The magistrate's tone was bored and indifferent; obviously he did not expect now to hear anything interesting.,"Ilya answered, always on the look out for another question like the one as to the time of the murder.",Every word echoed in his breast again as though it plucked a tense string in an empty space.,But no more cunning questions came.,"""As you went down the street that day, did you not meet a tall man in a short fur jacket and black lambs-wool cap?","Do you remember?""","""No,"" said Ilya harshly.","""Now, listen.","I'll read over your statement to you, and you will sign it.""","He held a sheet of paper covered with writing before his face, and began to read quickly and monotonously.","When he had finished, he put a pen in Ilya's hand.","Ilya bent down, signed, rose slowly from his chair, and said in a loud, assured voice, looking at the magistrate: ""Good-day!""","A short, condescending nod was his answer, and the magistrate bent over his desk, and began to write.",Ilya stood thinking.,He would gladly have said something more to this man who had held him so long on the rack.,"In the quiet, only the scratch of the pen was heard, then the woman's voice, singing, ""Dance away, dance away, dolly.""","""What do you want now?""","asked the magistrate, and raised his head.","""Nothing,"" said Ilya gloomily.","""I told you, you can go.""","""I'm going.""","""All right, then.""","They looked angrily at one another, and Ilya felt something heavy, terrifying, grow in his breast.",He turned sharp round and went out into the street.,"A cold wind greeted him, and for the first time he noticed that he was sweating profusely.",Half-an-hour later he was sitting with Olympiada.,"She opened the door to him herself, having seen him from the window.",She met him with almost a mother's joy.,"Her face was pale, and she gazed restlessly about with wide-open eyes.","""My clever boy!""","she cried, when Ilya told her that he had just come from the magistrate.","""Tell me, tell me, how did you get on?""","""The brute,"" said Ilya, in wrath.","""He set traps for me.""","""He can't help it,"" remarked Olympiada, in a tone of common sense.","""Let him be; it's his infernal duty.""","""Why didn't he say straight out--'So-and-so, this is what people think of you.'""","""Did you tell him everything straight out?""","she asked, smiling.","""I!""",cried Ilya in astonishment.,"""Why, yes--as a matter of fact--ah, devil take him!""","He seemed quite abashed and said after a while: ""And as I sat there, I thought, by God, I was right!""","""Now, thank heaven, it's all passed over all right.""",Ilya looked at her with a smile.,"""I didn't need to lie much.","I'm lucky, after all, Lipa!""",He laughed again in a strange way.,"""The secret police are always at my heels,"" said Olympiada, in a low voice, ""and after you too.""","""Of course,"" said Ilya, full of scorn and anger.","""They go sniffing around, and want to hem me in, like the beaters do to the wolf in the forest.","But they won't do it; they're not the men for that; and I'm not a wolf, but an unlucky man.",I didn't mean to strangle any one.,"Fate strangles me--as Pashka says in his poem--and it strangles Pashka too, and Jakov, and all of us.""","""Never mind, Ilushka.","Everything will go right now.""","Ilya got up, walked to the window, and said, with a despairing voice, as he looked at the street: ""All my life I've had to wallow in the mud.",I've always been pushed into things I disliked--hated.,I've never met a soul I could look at really happily.,"Is there nothing pure in life, nothing noble?","Now, I've strangled this--this man of yours,--why?","I've only smirched myself, and damned myself.",I took money.,"I ought not.""","""Don't be sorry!""",She tried to console him.,"""He isn't worth it.""","""I'm not sorry for him; only I want to get myself straight.","Every one tries, else he can't live.","That magistrate, he lives like a sugar-plum in its box.",No one will strangle him.,"He can be good and upright in his pretty nest.""","""Never mind, we'll go away together from this place.""","""No.","I'll go nowhere,"" cried Ilya fiercely, and wheeled round to her, and added, seeming to threaten some unknown person.","""No--no--patience!","I'll wait and see what will come; I'll fight it out still,"" and he strode up and down the room, and shook his head defiantly.","""Oh!""","said Olympiada, in an injured tone.","""You won't go with me, because you're afraid of me; you think I should always have a hold on you, you think I should use what I know--you're wrong, my dear.","I'll never drag you with me by force.""","She spoke quietly, but her lips twitched as though she were in pain.","""What did you say?""","asked Ilya, quite surprised.","""I won't compel you, don't be frightened; go where you will!""","""Wait a moment,"" said Ilya, as he sat down near her, and took her hand.","""I didn't understand what you said.""","""Don't pretend!""","she cried, and drew away her hand.","""I know you're proud, and passionate; you can't forgive the old man; you hate my life--you think that it's all come about through me.""","""You're talking foolishly,"" said Ilya, quietly.","""I don't blame you in the very least, I know that for men like me there are no women who are pretty and fine and pure as well.","Such women are dear, they are only for the rich, and we must love the soiled and those who are spat upon and abused.""","""Then leave me, the spat upon and abused!""","cried Olympiada, springing up from her chair.","""Go away--go away!""","But suddenly tears shone in her eyes and she covered Ilya with a flood of burning words, like hot coals.","""I myself, of my own will crept into this pit, because there's money in it.","I meant to climb up the ladder again with the money, begin a decent life--and you helped me, I know, and I love you, and will love you though you strangle twenty men; it isn't your goodness I love, but your pride, and your youth, your curly head and your strong arms and your dark eyes, and your reproaches that pierce my heart.","I shall be grateful for all this till I die.--I'll kiss your feet.""","She threw herself at his feet, and embraced his knees.","""God is my witness, I sinned to save my soul.","I must be dearer to Him if I don't end my life in this filth, but struggle through it and lead a clean life.",Then I will entreat His forgiveness.,"I will not endure this torment all my life; they have soiled me with mud and filth; all my tears will never wash me clean.""","At first Ilya tried to free himself and raise her from the ground, but she clung close to him, pressed her head against his knees and laid her cheek at his feet.","And she spoke on with a low, passionate, gasping voice.","Presently he caressed her with a trembling hand, raised her, embraced her, and laid her head on his shoulder, her hot cheek pressed close to his, and as she lay supported by his arms on her knees before him, she whispered: ""Does it do any one any good if a woman who has sinned once spends almost her whole life in humiliation?","When I was a girl and my stepfather came near me to make me impure, I stuck a knife in him.",I did it without a thought.,Then they made me drunk with wine and ruined me.,"I was a girl, so tidy, so pretty and red-cheeked as an apple.",I cried for myself.,I hurt myself.,I cried for my beauty.,I didn't want it!,I didn't want it!,And then I said to myself: 'It's all the same now.,There's no going back.,"Good,' I thought, 'at least I'll sell my shame as dear as I can.'",I never kissed from my heart till I kissed you.,"I always just lived in filth and rioting.""",Her words were lost in a soft whisper.,Suddenly she tore herself from Ilya's embrace.,"""Let me go!""","she cried, and thrust him away.","But he held her closer, and began to kiss her face, passionately, despairingly.","""Let me go!","You hurt me!""",she said.,"""I can say nothing,"" said Ilya, feverishly.","""Only one thing--no one has had pity on us, and we need have pity on no one.",You spoke so beautifully!,"Come, let me kiss you.",How else can I make it up to you?,My dear!,My dearest!,I love you!,"Ah, I don't know how I love you.","I've no words to tell you.""",Her lamentation had really roused in him a burning feeling of affection for this woman.,"Her sorrow and his misfortune were molten together, and their hearts came nearer and nearer.","They held one another in a close embrace, and softly told one another all the long sufferings they had endured from life.","A courageous, fierce feeling rose in Ilya's heart.","""We were not born for fortune, we two,"" said the woman, and shook her head hopelessly.","""Good!",Then we will celebrate out misfortune!,"Shall we go to the mines, to Siberia, together?",Eh?,"Ah, there's time for that.",As yet we will enjoy our pain and our love.,"Now they might burn me with red-hot irons, my heart is so light.","I repent nothing!""","Outside the window, the sky was a monotonous grey.",A cold mist enwrapped the earth and settled in white rime on the trees.,"In the little garden, a young birch-tree swayed its thin branches gently, and shook the snow away.",The winter evening came on.,XV.,Two days later Ilya learnt that a tall man in a lambs-wool cap was being sought for as the probable murderer of Poluektov.,"During the investigations made in the shop, two silver clasps from an eikon were found and it appeared that these were stolen goods.","The errand boy who had been employed in the business, stated that these mounts had been bought from a tall man in a short fur jacket, called Andrei, that this Andrei had several times before sold gold and silver ornaments to Poluektov, and that the money-changer had advanced him money.","Further it was known that on the evening before the murder and on the same day, a man corresponding to the description, had wasted much money in carousing in the public houses of the town.","Every day Ilya heard something new; the whole town took a keen interest in this crime, so ingeniously carried out, and in all the ale-houses and all the streets nothing else was spoken of.",But all the talk had little attraction for Ilya.,"Fear had fallen from his heart, like the scab from a wound, and instead he only felt now a sense of awkwardness.","He listened attentively to all that was said, but thought only--how would his life shape itself now, what had the future in store for him?","And the conviction that the murderer would not be discovered, strengthened every day.","He felt like a recruit before the conscription summons, or like a man who is proceeding towards some unknown far-off goal.","More than ever he felt the need to live for himself and take thought for himself, but life hissed and boiled round him like water in a kettle, and almost every day came something to distract his mind from its preoccupation.",He grew pale and thin.,Of late Jakov had been more drawn to him again.,"Tousled and carelessly dressed, he wandered aimlessly about the tap room and the courtyard, looking vaguely at everything with wandering eyes and had the appearance of a man brought face to face with strange ideas.","When he met Ilya he would ask him mysteriously, half aloud, or whispering, ""Have you no time to talk?""","""Wait a bit; I can't now.""","""It's something very important.""","""What is it?""","""It's a book.","I tell you, brother, the things in it----Oh!","oh!""","said Jakov, with a terrified air.","""Bother your books!","I'd rather know why your father always scowls at me now.""",But Jakov had no mind for realities.,"At Ilya's question he looked astonished, as though he hardly understood, and said: ""Eh?",I don't know.,"That is, once I heard him speaking to your uncle about it; something about your passing false money; but he only said it chaffing.""","""How do you know he was only chaffing?""","""Why, what a thing to say--false money,"" he interrupted Ilya with a gesture as though to wave the subject away.","""But won't you talk to me?","No time?""","""About your book?""","""Yes, there's a bit in it I've just read.",Oh!,"well!""",And the philosopher made a face as though something had scalded him.,Ilya looked at his friend as at a person half idiotic.,Sometimes Jakov seemed to him absolutely blind.,"He took him for an unlucky man, unfit to cope with life.","The gossip ran in the house, and it was all over the street already, that Petrusha was going to marry his mistress, who kept a public house in the town.",But Jakov paid absolutely no attention.,"When Ilya asked him when the wedding was to be, he said: ""Whose wedding?""","""Why, your father's.""","""Oh!",who's to know?,disgusting!,"A pretty witch he's chosen!""","""Do you know she has a son--a big boy, who goes to the High School?""","""No, I didn't know.","Why?""","""He'll come in for your father's property.""","""Oh!""","said Jakov, indifferently, then with a sudden interest, ""A son, you say?""","""Yes.""","""A son--that'll just do, father can stick him behind the bar, and I can do what I like.","That'll suit me.""",And he smacked his lips as with a foretaste of his longed-for freedom.,"Ilya looked at him with pity, then said, mockingly: ""The proverb is right, 'Give the stupid child a piece of bread if he wants a carrot.'",You!,"I can't imagine how you're going to live.""","Jakov pricked up his ears, looked at Ilya with big eyes starting out of his head, then said in a hurried whisper: ""I know how I shall live!",I've thought about it!,"Before everything, one must get one's soul in order; must understand what God wants one to do.","Now I see one thing; the ways of men are all confused, like tangled threads, and they are drawn in different directions, and no one knows what to hold to or where to let himself be drawn.",Now a man is born--no one knows why--and lives--I don't know why--and death comes and blows out the light.,"Before anything else I must know what I'm in the world for, mustn't I?""","""You--you've tied yourself up in your cobwebs,"" said.",Ilya with some heat.,"""I'd like to know what's the sense of that?""","He felt that Jakov's dark sayings gripped his heart more strongly than of old, and waked very strange thoughts in him.","He felt as though there were a being in his mind, the same that always opposed his clear, simple conception of a clean, comfortable life, that listened to Jakov with strange curiosity, and moved in his soul like a child in the mother's womb.","This troubled Ilya, confused him, and seemed to him undesirable, and therefore he avoided conversation with Jakov; but it was not easy to get rid of him once he had begun.","""What's the sense?",It's very simple.,"Not to be clear where you're going's like trying to burn without fire, isn't it?","You must know where you're going, and why, and if it's the right road.""","""You're like an old man, Jakov--you're a bit of a bore.","My opinion is, as the proverb says: 'Seeing that even swine long to be happy, how should man do otherwise.'","Good-bye!""","After such conversation, he felt as though he had eaten something very salt; he was overcome with thirst, and longed for something out of the common.",The thought of the punishment God held over him burned more brightly in him and singed his soul; he sought for loneliness and could not find it.,"Then he would go to Olympiada, and in her arms seek forgetfulness and peace from torturing thought.",Sometimes he would go to see Vyera.,The life she led had drawn her deeper and deeper into its deep turbid whirlpool.,"She used to tell Ilya with excitement, of feasting with rich young tradesmen, with officials and officers, of suppers in restaurants and troika excursions.","She showed him new dresses and jackets, the gifts of her admirers.","Luxurious, strong, and healthy, she was proud to be entreated and quarrelled over.","Ilya rejoiced in her health and good spirits and beauty, but more than once warned her: ""Don't lose your head at the game, Vyeratchka.""","""What's the odds?",It's my way.,"At least, one lives in style.",I take all I can get from life.,"That's enough!""","""Well, what about Pavel?""","As soon as he named her lover, she lost her gaiety and her brows contracted.","""If only he'd let me go my own way!","It troubles him so, and he torments himself so!",If only he'd be content with what I can give him.,"But he wants me altogether, and I can't stop now; I'm like a fly caught in the treacle.""","""Don't you love him?""","""I can't help it,"" she replied, seriously, ""he's such a fine fellow.""","""Very well, then, you ought to live with him.""","""With him?",Nice drag I should be on him!,"He has barely a bit of bread for himself, how's he to keep me too?","No, I'm sorry for him.""","""Look out that no harm comes of it.","He's hot-tempered,"" Ilya warned her one day; but she laughed.","""He?","He's as gentle--I can twist him which way I want.""","""You'll break him!""","""Good heavens!""","she cried crossly, ""what am I to do?",Was I born for just one man?,"Every one wants to enjoy his life, and every one lives for himself, as he pleases, just as you do, and I do.""","""N--No!","it isn't so exactly,"" said Ilya gloomily and thoughtfully.","""We all live, but not only for ourselves.""","""For whom, then?""","""Take yourself, for instance.","You live for the young clerks and all sorts of easy-going people.""","""I'm easy-going too,"" said Vyera, and laughed contentedly.","Ilya left her, in a downcast mood.","Only twice, and for a moment, had he seen Pavel during this time.","Once when he met his friend at Vyera's house, he had sat there dark and troubled, silent, with teeth clenched and a red spot on each cheek.","Ilya understood that Pavel was jealous of him, and that flattered his vanity.","But he saw too, clearly, that Gratschev was tangled in a net, from which he would hardly free himself without severe injury.","He pitied Pavel, and still more Vyera, and gave up visiting her.",He was living a new honeymoon with Olympiada.,"But here too, a cold shadow glided in and took the peace from his heart.","Sometimes, in the midst of a conversation, he would sink into a deep moodiness.","Olympiada said to him once, in a loving whisper: ""Dear, don't think of it.","There are so few men in the world whose hands are clean.""","""Listen!""",he answered seriously and tonelessly.,"""Please don't speak of that to me!","I'm not thinking of my hands, but of my soul.","You are clever, but you can never understand what it is that moves me.","Tell me, if you can, how shall a man begin, what shall he do, to live honourably and cleanly, peacefully and rightly to others?",That is what I want to know.,"But say nothing to me of the old man!""","But she could not keep silence, and implored him again and again to forget.","He grew angry, and went away.","When he returned, she flew out at him, and exclaimed that he only loved her out of fear, or from pity; that she would not endure it, and would rather leave him, rather go away out of the town.","She wept, pinched or bit him, then kissed his feet, or tore her clothes like a mad thing, and said: ""Am I not beautiful, desirable?","And I love you with every vein, every drop of my blood.","Hurt me, tear me, and I'll laugh at it.""","Her blue eyes would darken, her lips quiver, and her bosom heave.","Then he would embrace her and kiss her passionately; but afterwards, as he went home, he would wonder how she, so full of life, so passionate, how could she endure the disgusting caresses of that old man?","Then Olympiada appeared so pitiable, so contemptible that he could spit for disgust when he thought of her kisses.","One day, after such an outbreak, he said to her, tired of her caresses: ""Do you love me more warmly since I strangled that old devil?""","""Yes, of course.","Why?""","""Nothing.","It makes me laugh to think there are people who like a stale egg better than a fresh, and would rather eat an apple when its rotten--odd!""","She looked at him wearily, and said in a tired voice: ""'Every beast likes something best,' as the saying goes.","One likes the owl, another the nightingale.""",And both fell into a heavy moodiness.,"One day when Ilya had returned home and was changing his clothes, Terenti came quietly into the room.","He shut the door fast behind him, stood a moment, as if listening, then pushed to the bolts.","Ilya noticed this, and looked at him mockingly.","""Ilusha,"" began Terenti, in a low voice as he sat down on a chair.","""Well.""","""There are strange reports going about you; people say evil things of you.""","The hunchback sighed, and closed his eyes.","""For instance?""","said Ilya, drawing on his boots.","""Some say one thing, some another; some say you were mixed up in that affair when the old merchant was strangled; others say you pass false money.""","""They're envious, eh?""","""Different people have been here, secret police it seems--detectives--they questioned Petrusha about you.""","""Let them till they're tired,"" said Ilya, indifferently.","""Certainly, what have they to do with us if we have no sins on our conscience?""",Ilya laughed and stretched himself on the bed.,"""They don't come now, but Petrusha is always on about it,"" said Terenti shyly, in an embarrassed way.","""He's always taunting one, Petrusha.","You ought to take a little room for yourself somewhere, Ilusha, a room of your own to live in.",Yes.,"'I can't have these worthy dark gentlemen in my house,' says Petrusha.","'I'm a town councillor,' he says.""","Ilya turned, his face red with anger, on his uncle, and said loudly: ""Listen!","If he values his ugly face, let him hold his tongue!",Tell him that!,"If I hear one word I don't like, I'll smash his skull for him.","Whatever I am, he, at any rate, has no call to judge me, the scoundrel!",And I'll go away when I want to.,"Meantime I shall stay and enjoy this honourable and distinguished company.""","The hunchback was terrified at Ilya's wrath; he sat silent a while, rubbing his back, and looking at his nephew with big eyes full of anxious expectation.",Ilya compressed his lips and stared at the ceiling.,"Terenti looked at him, the curly head, serious handsome face, with the small moustache and strong chin, the broad chest and all the vigorous, well-knit body, and then said slowly, with a sigh: ""What a fine lad you've grown!",the girls in the village would crowd after you.,"We'll go to the village.""",Ilya was silent.,"""H'm, yes--you'll have a real life there!","I'll give you money, and set you up in business, and then you'll marry a rich girl, he!",he!,"And your life will glide along like a sleigh on the snow downhill.""","""Perhaps I prefer to go uphill,"" said Ilya, peevishly.","""Of course, uphill,"" Terenti caught up his words.","""That's what I meant; it's an easy life--that's what I meant; why, uphill, of course, to the very top.""","""And when I'm there, what then?""",The hunchback looked at him and chuckled.,"Then he spoke again, but Ilya did not listen.","He was thinking of all his experiences of this later time, and figuring to himself how evenly all life hangs together, like the strings in a net.","Circumstances surround men and lead them where they will, as the police do the rogues.","He had always had it in his mind to leave this house and live by himself, and now here chance comes to his aid!","He was still thinking how he would plan out his life alone, when there came a sudden knock at the door.","""Open it!""","cried Ilya crossly to his uncle, who was shaking with fear.","The hunchback drew back the bolts and Jakov appeared, a great, red-brown book in his hand.","""Ilya, come to Mashutka!""","he said quickly, and advanced to the bed.","""What's wrong with her?""",said Ilya hastily.,"""With her?","I don't know, she's not at home.""","""Where does she always go gadding to in the evenings?""",asked the hunchback in a tone of annoyance.,"""She always goes out with Matiza,"" said Ilya.","""She'll get a lot of good there!""","answered Terenti, with emphasis.","""It doesn't matter.","Come Ilya!""",Jakov caught Ilya by the sleeve and drew him away.,"""Hold on!""",cried Lunev.,"""Tell me, have you got your mind clear yet?""","""Think--it's here--the Black Magic's here!""","whispered Jakov, radiant.","""Who?""","asked Ilya, pulling on his felt slippers.","""Why, you know, the book.",Heavens!,you'll see.,Come.,"Extraordinary things, I tell you,"" Jakov went on enthusiastically, as he dragged his friend along the dark passage.","""It's awful to read, it's like falling down a precipice.""",Ilya saw his friend's excitement and heard how his voice shook.,"When they reached the cobbler's room, and had lighted the lamp, he saw that Jakov's face was quite pale, and his eyes dim and happy, like those of a drunken man.","""Have you been drinking?""","asked Ilya, suspiciously.","""I?",No.,Not a drop to-day!,"I never drink now, anyway, or only when father's at home, to screw up my courage, two or three glasses, no more.","I'm afraid of father--always drinks stuff that doesn't smell too strong though--but never mind that, listen!""","He fell into a chair so heavily that it creaked, opened his book, bent double over it, and fingering the old pages, yellow with age, he read in a hollow, trembling voice: ""'Third Chapter--On the origin of man.'","Now, listen!""","He sighed, took his left hand off the book, and read aloud.","The index finger of his right hand preceded his voice, as though writing in the old book.","""'It is said, and Diodorus confirms, that the origin of man is conceived according to two ways, by the virtuous men'--d'you hear, virtuous men--'who have written on the nature of things.","Some consider that the world is uncreated and imperishable, and that the race of men has existed from eternity, without any beginning.'""","Jakov raised his head, and said in a whisper, gesticulating with his hand in the air: ""D'you hear?","Without beginning!""","""Go on!""","said Ilya, and looked distrustfully at the old leather-bound book.","Jakov's voice continued, softly and solemnly: ""'This opinion was held, according to Cicero, by Pythagoras of Samos, Archytas of Tarentum, Plato of Athens, Xenokrates, Aristotle of Stagira, and many others of the peripatetic philosophers, who took the view that all that is, exists from eternity, and has no beginning'--d'you see, again, no beginning--'but that there is a certain cycle of life, those that were born and those that are born, in which cycle is the beginning and the end of every man that is born.'""","Ilya stretched out his hand and struck the book, and

then at his friend, and said gently: ""Perhaps you know your beginning?""","""What beginning?""",cried Ilya crossly.,"""Don't shout so!",Take the soul.,"Man is born with a soul, isn't he?""","""Well?""","""Then he must know where he comes from, and how?","The soul is immortal, they say.",It was always there; isn't that true?,Wait!,It isn't so much to know how you were born as how you lived.,When did you live?,When did you first know that you were alive?,You were born living.,"Well, then, when did you become living.",In the womb?,Very well.,"Why don't you remember more--what happened before your birth, and not only what happened after you were five years old?",Eh?,"And, if you have a soul, how did it get inside you?",Eh?,"Tell me.""","Jakov's eyes shone triumphantly, his face broke into a happy smile, and he cried, with a joy that seemed to Ilya very strange: ""You see, there you have your soul!""","""Stupid!""","said Ilya, and looked at him angrily, ""what's that to be glad about?""","""I'm not glad.","I'm only saying--I'm only saying----"" ""Well, I tell you, throw the book away!",You see quite well it's written against God.,"It doesn't matter a bit how I was born alive, but how I live.","How to live so that everything is clean and pleasant, so that no one hurts me, and I hurt nobody.","Find me a book that'll make that plain to me.""","Jakov sat silent and thoughtful, his head on his breast.",His joy vanished when it found no echo.,"After a time he said: ""When I look at you, there's something about you I don't like.","I don't understand your thoughts, but I see you've been getting very proud about something or other for some time.","You go on as if you were the only righteous man.""",Ilya laughed aloud.,"""What are you laughing at?",It's true.,You judge every one so harshly.,"You don't love anybody.""","""There you're right,"" said Ilya, fiercely.","""Whom should I love; and why?",What good have men done to me?,"Every one wants to get his bread by some one else's work, and every one cries out: 'love me, respect me, give me a share of your goods; then perhaps I'll love you!'","Every one, every where, thinks of nothing but stuffing himself.""","""No.","I think men don't think only of stuffing themselves,"" answered Jakov displeased and hurt.","""I know--every one tries to adorn himself with something, but it's only a mask.","I see my uncle try and bargain with God, like the shopman with his master.",Your papa gives one or two weathercocks to churches.,"I conclude from that that he either has swindled some one or is going to; and so they all behave, as far as I can see; there's your penny they say, but give me back five.","I read the other day in the paper of Migunov the merchant, who gave three hundred roubles to a hospital, and then petitions the town council to knock off the arrears of his taxes, just a thousand roubles--and so they all do, trying to throw dust in one another's eyes and put themselves in the right.","My view is, if you've sinned, willingly or unwillingly, take your punishment!""","""You're right there,"" said Jakov thoughtfully.","""What you said of father and the hunchback, that was right too.",Ah!,we're both born under an evil star.,"You have your wickedness at any rate, you comfort yourself by judging everybody, but I have not even that.",Oh!,"if only I could go away somewhere,

table opposite one another, gloomy and silent, and there lay the big red-brown book with the steel clasp.","Suddenly there was a rustling in the passage, a low voice was heard and a hand fumbled at the door for the latch.",The friends waited in silence.,"The door opened slowly, and Perfishka staggered in: he stumbled on the threshold and fell on his knees, holding up his harmonica.","""Prr,""--he said, and laughed drunkenly.",Immediately behind him Matiza crept into the room.,"She bent over the cobbler, took his arm and tried to lift him up, saying with stammering tongue: ""Ah!",How drunk he is!,"Oh, you soaker!""","""Don't touch me, jade!","I'll stand alone, quite alone.""","He swayed hither and thither, but got on his legs with difficulty, and came up to the two friends: he stretched out his left hand and cried: ""Welcome to my house!""","Matiza laughed, a deep, silly laugh.","""Where do you come from?""",asked Ilya.,Jakov looked at the two with a smile and said nothing.,"""Where?",From the deep sea!,Ha!,ha!,"my dear, good boys.",Oh!,"yes!""","Perfishka stamped his feet on the floor and sang:     ""Oh little bones, dear little bones,     I weep for you in piteous tones.","For hardly are you grown at all     Before the shopman cracks you small.""","""Sing, you jade, sing too,"" he screamed, turning to Matiza, ""or let's sing the song you taught me, go ahead!""","He leant his back against the stove, where Matiza had already found support, and dug his elbow into her ribs, while his fingers wandered over the harmonica keys.","""Where is Mashutka?""","asked Ilya suddenly, in a harsh voice.","""Yes, tell us,"" cried Jakov, and sprang from his chair.","""Where is she?","Tell us!""",But the drunken pair paid no heed to the question.,"Matiza leant her head to one side and sang: ""Ah!","neighbour, your brandy is rousing and good.""","And Perfishka struck in in a high tenor: ""Drink it, my neighbour, it comforts the blood.""","Ilya stepped up to the cobbler, caught him by the shoulder, and shook him, till he fell against the stove.","""Where's your daughter?""",he said commandingly.,"""And oh!","his daughter she vanished away,     In the midnight hour, ere the break of day,"" babbled Perfishka, and held his head with his hand.","Jakov attempted to get the truth from Matiza, but she only said smirking: ""I won't tell.",I won't.,"I won't.""","""They've sold her, the devils,"" said Ilya to his friend, gloomily.","Jakov looked at him in terror, then asked the cobbler almost weeping: ""Perfishka!","listen--Where is Mashutka?""","""Mashutka?""","repeated Matiza, scornfully.","""Aha!",you see.,"Now you remember.""","""Ilya!","what shall we do?""",cried Jakov full of anxiety.,"""We must tell the police,"" said Ilya, and looked with disgust at the drunkards.","""Aha!",jade!,"d'you hear,"" shouted Perfishka, beaming, ""they want to tell the police!",ha!,ha!,"ha!""","""The po--lice?""","cried Matiza emphatically, and looked with extraordinary great eyes from Ilya to Jakov and back again.","Then stretching out her hands helplessly, she screamed loudly: ""You'll go to your police, will you?",Get out of my room!,"It is my room now, we're just married, we two.""","""Ha!",ha!,ha!,"laughed the cobbler, holding his sides.","""Come Jakov!""",said Ilya.,"""The devil would be sickened at them!","Come.""","""Wait!""","cried Jakov, in anxious excitement.","""Have they really married her?",That child?,Is it possible?,"Perfishka, tell me, have you really.","Oh, tell me,

a sound, and instead, put out his tongue at Jakov and laughed again.","Matiza pressed close to Ilya with her huge bosom heaving, and roared: ""Who are you, eh?","D'you think we don't know all about you?""",Ilya gave her a push and left the cellar.,"In the passage Jakov overtook him, caught him by the shoulder, held him fast in the darkness, and said: ""Is it allowed; can it be done?","She's so little, Ilya!","Have they really married her!""","""Oh!","don't whimper!""",said Ilya wrathfully.,"""That's no good!","You ought to have kept your eyes open before; you began it, and now they've finished it.""","Jakov was silent for a moment, then at once began again, as he stepped into the courtyard after Ilya.","""It's not my fault.","I only knew that she went out to work somewhere.""","""What does it matter, if you knew or didn't know?""","said Ilya, harshly, and stood still in the middle of the courtyard.","""I'll get out of this house anyhow; it ought to be burnt to the ground.""","""O God!","O God!""","sighed Jakov, in a low voice, keeping behind Ilya.",Ilya wheeled round.,"Jakov stood there miserable, his arms hanging helplessly and his head bowed as if to receive a blow.","""Cry away!""","said Ilya, mockingly, and went off, leaving his friend in the middle of the dark courtyard.","Next day Ilya learnt from Perfishka that Masha was actually married to Ehrenov the grocer, a widower of fifty, who had lost his wife shortly before.","""'I've two children,' he said to me, 'one five years old, one three,'"" explained Perfishka, ""'and I shall have to get a nurse.","But a nurse,' he says, 'is always a stranger.","She'll rob me, and that sort of thing.","Speak to your daughter, if she'll marry me!'","Well, so I spoke to her, and Matiza spoke to her, and since Masha is a reasonable child, she understood it all, and what else was she to do?","'All right,' she says, 'I'll do it!'",And so she went to him.,It was all settled in three days.,"We two--I and Matiza--got three roubles, so yesterday we got drunk.",Heavens!,"how Matiza drinks, like a horse!""",Ilya listened in silence.,He understood that Masha had done better for herself than would have been generally expected.,"But all the same, his heart ached for the girl.","He had seen little of her of late, and hardly thought of her, but now, without her, the house felt dirtier and more hateful than ever.","The yellow, bloated face of the cobbler grinned down at Ilya from the stove, and his voice creaked like a broken branch in the autumn wind.",Lunev looked at him disgustedly.,"""Ehrenov made one condition: I'm never to show up at his house!","'You can come to the shop,' he says.","'I'll give you schnapps and odds and ends, but to the house--never!","It's shut to you, like Paradise.'","Now then, Ilya Jakovlevitch, couldn't you hunt up a five-kopeck piece, to get a drink.","Please give me five kopecks.""","""You shall have 'em in a minute,"" said Ilya.","""What are you going to do now?""","The cobbler spat on the ground, and replied: ""I'll just become an out-and-out drunkard.","Till Masha was provided for, I used to worry.",I worked sometimes.,I had a sort of conscience with her.,"But now I know she's enough to eat and shoes and clothes, and is shut up in a box, so to speak, I can devote myself, free and unhindered, to the drinking profession.""","""Can't you really give up brandy?""","""Never!""","answered the cobbler, and shook his shaggy head in a vigorous negative.","""Why should I?""","""Is there nothing else in life you want?""","""Give me five kopecks.","I don't want anything else.""","""I can't understand that,"" said Ilya, shrugging his shoulders.","""I can't understand how a man can live, and want nothing out of life.""","""I'm different from the rest,"" answered Perfishka, with philosophical calm.","""I think this way: keep quiet!--Fate gives what it will, and if a man is hollow and empty, so that nothing can be put in him, then, what can Fate do?","Once, I admit, I wanted things, while my dead one was alive--I knew of Jeremy's pile.",I'd have liked to have a fist in that.,"'If I don't rob him,' I thought, 'some one else will.'","Well, thank God, two others actually got in before me.","I don't complain, but then I understood that one must learn, too, how to wish.""","The cobbler laughed, climbed down from the stove, and added: ""Now give me the five kopecks.",My inside's on fire.,"I can't stand it any more.""","""There!","Have your glass,"" said Ilya.","Then he looked at Perfishka with a smile, and asked: ""Shall I tell you something?""","""Well, what?""","""You're a humbug, and a good-for-nothing, and a miserable drunkard.","That's all certain.""","""Yes, it's certain,"" confessed the cobbler, standing before Ilya with the five-kopeck piece in his hand.","""And yet,"" Ilya went on seriously and thoughtfully, ""I don't believe I know a better man than you, by God, I don't.""","Perfishka smiled incredulously, and

opinion.""","""Wonderful!","my head's too stupid I'm afraid; did I understand you to say----But let me have a mouthful, perhaps then I'll be cleverer.""","""Not so fast!""","said Ilya, and caught him by the shirt sleeve.","""I want to ask you one thing--do you fear God?""","Perfishka shifted uneasily from one foot to the other, and said in a voice that sounded a little hurt: ""I have no reason to fear God.","I do no harm to anyone--never have.""","""And now, do you pray?""","""Oh, I pray, of course--not often.""","Ilya saw that the cobbler had no desire to talk, and that his whole soul was longing for the tap room.","""There you are, Perfishka--ten more!""","""My word!","that's what I call treating!""",cried Perfishka and beamed with joy.,"""But tell me, how do you pray?""",Lunev pressed him again.,"""I?",Quite simply.,I don't know any prayers.,"I knew 'the Virgin Mother of God' once, but I forgot it long ago.","There's a beggar's prayer: 'O Lord Jesus,' and so on, I know that by heart right to the end.",Perhaps when I'm old I'll use it.,But now I just pray in my own way.,"'Lord have mercy,' I say.""","Perfishka looked at the ceiling, nodded with conviction, and went on.","""He'll understand up there.",Can I go now?,"I've an awful thirst.""","""Go on--go on,"" said Ilya, and looked at Perfishka thoughtfully.","""But see here, when the day comes, when the Lord asks you, How have you lived?""","""Then I'll say, 'when I was born I was small, and when I died I was dead drunk.",So I don't know.',"Then He'll laugh and forgive me.""",The cobbler smiled pleasantly and hurried away.,Lunev remained in the cellar alone.,"He was strangely moved to think that Masha's pretty little face would never again appear to him in this narrow, dirty cave, and that Perfishka would soon be turned out.","The April sun shone through the window and illuminated the floor, now long uncleaned.","Everything there was untidy, hateful, and melancholy, as though a dead body had just been borne away.","Ilya sat upright on his chair, looked at the big stove, rubbed away on the one side, and gloomy thoughts passed in succession through his mind.","""Shall I go out and confess?""",flashed suddenly up in his heart.,But he thrust the thought away from him angrily.,XVI.,On the evening of this day Ilya was compelled to leave Petrusha's house.,Events fell out in this way.,"When he returned, his uncle met him in the courtyard, with downcast countenance, led him aside to a corner behind a pile of wood, and said: ""Now, Ilusha, you must get away from here.","The things that have happened here to-day--awful, I tell you.""","The hunchback closed his eyes, wrung his hands, and broke into a fit of coughing.","""Jashka got drunk and called his father to his face, 'You thief' and other bad names--'Shameless beast,' and 'heartless fellow.'","He just screamed like a madman, and Petrusha hit him in the mouth, and tore his hair, and kicked him till he bled all over; and now Jashka's lying in his room and groaning and crying.--And then Petrusha began at me.","'It's your fault,' he growled.",'Get your Ilya away.',He thinks you've stirred up Jakov against him.,"He shouted awfully.--It was terrible!""","Ilya took the straps from his shoulders, handed his box to his uncle, and said, ""Wait a minute!""","""Wait!",But what?,Why?,"He'll----"" Ilya's hands trembled with wrath against Petrusha and pity for Jakov.","""Hold my box, I say!""","he said impatiently, and went into the bar.","He clenched his teeth till his jaws ached, and a buzzing noise went through his head.","He heard his uncle call after him something about police and damaging himself, and prison, but he did not stop.","Petrusha stood behind the counter, smiling and talking to a raggedly-dressed man.","The lamp-light fell on his bald head, and it shone as though the whole gleaming cranium smiled.","""Aha!",Mr.,"Merchant!""","he cried mockingly, and his brows contracted at the sight of Ilya, ""you're just in time.""","He stood before the door of his room, his body hiding it.","Ilya went close up to him, insolent and overbearing, and said loudly: ""Out of the way!""","""Wh--at?""",drawled Petrusha.,"""Let me by!","I want to see Jakov.""","""I'll give you something to remember your Jakov!""","Without another word, Ilya struck out with all his might and hit Petrusha on the cheek.",He howled aloud and fell on the floor.,"The pot-boys ran from all sides, and some one cried: ""Hold him!","Thrash him!""","The customers sprung up as though boiling water were poured on them, but Ilya sprung over Petrusha's body, went into the room behind, and bolted the door.","A tin lamp with a blackened chimney burned flickeringly in the little room, made still smaller by wine-bins and boxes of all kinds.","At first Ilya did not distinguish his friend in the dark, cramped space.","Jakov lay on the floor, his head in the shadow, and his face seemed black and dreadful.","Ilya took the lamp, and, bending down, examined the maltreated lad.","Bluish spots and bruises covered the face like a horrible dark mask; the eyes were swollen; he breathed with difficulty and groaned and evidently could not see, for he asked, as Ilya bent over him: ""Who is it?""","""I,"" said Lunev softly, and straightened himself.","""Give me something to drink!""",Ilya turned round.,"There was a loud knocking at the door, and some one called out: ""We'll try it from the stairs at the back!""","""Run for the police!""",said another.,"Petrusha's whimpering rose above the noise: ""You all saw it!",I never touched him.,"O--oh!""",Ilya smiled rejoicingly.,He liked to realise that Petrusha was suffering.,He stepped to the door and began to parley with the besiegers.,"""Hullo, you there!",Stop your noise!,"If I gave him one in the mouth, he won't die of it, and I'll take my punishment from the magistrate.",Don't you shove yourselves in!,Don't bang on the door!,"I'll open it.""","He opened the door, and stood on the threshold, his fists clenched in case of an attack.",The crowd gave back before his strong figure and fighting look.,"Only Petrusha growled, pushing the others aside: ""Ah, you robber!","Wait, I'll----"" ""Take him away--and look here, just look here!""","cried Ilya, inviting the crowd to enter, ""see how he's handled this fellow!""","Several customers came in, with anxious side glances at Ilya, and bent down over Jakov.","One said, astonished and frightened: ""He's smashed him up!""","""He's absolutely cut to ribbons!""",added another.,"""Bring some water,"" said Ilya, ""and then we must have the police.""","The crowd was now on his side, he read it in their manner, and said aloud and with emphasis: ""You all know Petrusha Filimonov; you know that he is the biggest rascal in the street, and who has a word to say against his son?","Well, here lies the son, wounded, perhaps maimed for life; and the father is to get off scot-free, is he?","I have struck him once; I shall be condemned for that, is that right and fair?",Is that even justice?,And so it is all round.,"One man may do as he likes, and another must not move an eyelash.""","One or two sighed sympathetically, others went silently away.","Ilya was going on, but Petrusha burst into the room and turned them all out.","""Get out!",Be off!,This is my affair.,"He's my son, I'm his father.",Be off!,"I'm not afraid of the police, and I don't need 'em, either--not a bit of it.","I'll settle with you, my lad.","Clear out of this!""","Ilya kneeled down, gave Jakov a glass of water and looked with deep compassion at his friend's swollen closed eyes and discoloured face.","Jakov drank and whispered: ""He's knocked my teeth out, it hurts me to breathe, get me out of the house, Ilusha, get me away!""",Tears flowed from his swollen eyes down over his cheeks.,"""He'll have to be taken to the hospital,"" said Ilya sternly, turning to Petrusha.",Petrusha looked at his son and murmured to himself unintelligibly.,"Of his eyes, one was wide open, the other swollen up like Jakov's from the blow of Ilya's fist.","""Do you hear?""",shouted Ilya.,"""Don't shout so!""","said Petrusha, suddenly becoming quiet and peaceful.","""He can't go to the hospital.",There'd be a row!,You've made bother enough already here.,"I'm a town councillor, you know.","It's bad for my reputation.""","""You old blackguard!""","said Ilya, and spat contemptuously.","""I tell you, take him to the hospital, or there'll be another sort of row.""","""Now, now, don't--keep your temper!","you know it's half imagination.""","Ilya sprang up at these words, but Filimonov was already at the door and called to a waiter: ""Ivan, call a droshky to go to the hospital!","Jakov, pull yourself together, don't make yourself out worse than you are; it's your own father beat you, not a stranger--yes--I usen't to be so tenderly handled, my word, no!""","He moved restlessly about the room, took Jakov's clothes from their pegs, and threw them to Ilya, still dilating freely upon the thrashings he had received in his young days.","""Thanks,"" said Jakov in a voice hardly audible to Ilya, and the tears flowed on from his swollen eyes over his blood-stained cheeks.","Terenti was standing behind the counter; he whispered shyly in Ilya's ear: ""What'll you have?",three kopecks' worth or five?,"There--please, five--caviar?--the caviar's all gone.","I'm sorry, will you try a sardine?""","After Lunev had left Jakov at the hospital he realised he could not return to Filimonov's house, and he went to Olympiada.","He felt as though a cold mist drove through his body, something gnawed at his heart and stole away his strength.","Sadness lay heavy on his breast, his thoughts were confused, he walked wearily; one thing only stood out clearly, he could not live much longer in this way.","The dream of a little pretty shop, a life apart from the world in cleanliness and comfort, rose up anew and more strongly.","Next day he hired a lodging, a little room next to a kitchen.",A young woman in a red blouse let it to him.,"Her face was rosy, with a little saucy nose and a small, pretty mouth; she had a narrow brow framed in black curly hair that she frequently threw back with a quick movement of her slender, small fingers.","""Five roubles for such a pretty little room, that is not dear!""","she said cheerfully, and smiled as she saw that her dark, vivacious eyes threw the broad-shouldered lad into some confusion.","Ilya looked at the walls of his future home, and wondered what sort of young woman this might be.","""You see the paper is quite new, the window looks on the garden, what could be nicer?","In the morning I'll put the samovar outside your door, but you must take it in yourself.""","""Do you do the waiting here, then?""",asked Ilya with curiosity.,"The girl ceased to smile, her eyebrows twitched, she drew herself up and said, condescendingly: ""I am not the housemaid, but the owner of this house, and my husband----"" ""Why, are you married?""","cried Ilya in astonishment, and looked incredulously at her pretty slender figure.","She was not angered, but laughed gaily: ""How funny you are!","first you take me for a housemaid, then you won't believe I'm married.""","""How can I believe it, when you look just like a little girl?""","said Ilya, and laughed too.","""And I tell you, that I've been married for three years, and that my man is district inspector--in the police.""","Ilya looked in her face and smiled quietly, he did not know why.","""What a silly!""","cried the girl, shrugging her shoulders and inspecting Ilya curiously.","""Well, anyhow, will you take the room?""","""Agreed!","D'you want a deposit?""","""Of course, a rouble, at least.""","""I'll bring my things in, in two or three hours.""","""As you please.","I'm glad to have such a lodger, you're a cheerful one, I fancy.""","""Not specially,"" said Lunev, smiling.","He went out into the street still smiling, with a feeling of pleasure in his breast.","He liked both the room, with its blue wall-paper, and the brisk little woman, and he liked specially to think he was going to live in the house of a police inspector.","It seemed to him at once comical, with a certain irony, and rather dangerous.","He was on his way to visit Jakov at the hospital, and took a droshky to get there sooner.","On the way he laughed in his heart and considered what to do with the money, and where to hide it.","When he reached the hospital, he was told that Jakov had just had a bath, and was now fast asleep.","He stood by the corridor window, and did not know whether to go away or wait till Jakov woke up.","Patients passed him, shuffling slowly in slippers, in yellow night-gowns, and as they went they looked at him with melancholy eyes.","They chattered in low voices with one another, and through their whispers rang a painful, groaning coming from somewhere far off.","A dull echo, redoubling every sound, boomed through the long corridor; it was as though some one floated invisible on the heavy air of the hospital, groaning mournfully and lamenting.","Ilya felt he must leave these yellow walls at once, but suddenly one of the patients came up to him with outstretched hand, and said in a muffled voice: ""How are you?""","Lunev looked up, then stepped back in surprise.","""Pavel?",Goodness!,"are you here too?""","""Who else is here?""",asked Pavel quickly.,"His face was curiously grey, his eyes blinked restlessly and confusedly.","""Jakov is here!",his father thrashed him--and now you here too!,"Been here long?""","Then he added compassionately: ""Ah, brother, how changed you look!""","Pavel sighed, his lips twitched and his eyes looked strangely dull.","He hung his head as though guilty, and repeated hoarsely: ""Changed?","Oh yes.""","""What's the matter?""",asked Lunev sympathetically.,"""Matter?","You can guess, surely.""","Pavel glanced at Ilya's face, and then let his head fall again.","""Not Vyera?""","""Who else?""",answered Pavel gloomily.,"Ilya shook his head, was silent a moment, then said bitterly: ""It's our fate, who knows when my turn'll come?""","Pavel smiled sadly, then came closer and looking confidingly in Ilya's face, he said: ""I thought you'd be disgusted with me.",I was walking here and all at once I saw you.,"I was ashamed and turned my face away as I passed you.""","""That was a very clever thing to do,"" said Ilya, reproachfully.","""How's one to know how people take a thing like that?","To tell the truth, it's beastly.","Ah, brother!",two weeks have I been here.,"The torture, the dreariness!","You go about, and lie in bed and think, think!",The nights are awful.,Like lying on red-hot coals.,"The time draws out, like a hair in the milk.","It's like being drawn down into a swamp, and you're alone and can't call for help.""",Pavel spoke almost in a whisper.,"A shudder passed over his face, as if from cold, and his hands grasped convulsively at the collar of his dressing-gown.","He shook his head, and said, still half-aloud: ""Once fate starts against you to mock you, it goes like a hammer on your heart.""","""Where is Vyera?""","asked Ilya, thoughtfully.","""The devil knows!""","said Pavel, with a bitter smile.","""Doesn't she come to see you?""","""Once.",But I sent her packing.,"I can't bear the sight of her, the little beast!""",cried Pavel angrily.,"Ilya looked reproachfully at his altered face, and said: ""Nonsense!","If you want justice, then be just!","Why, is it her fault?","Think a minute.""","""Then, whose fault is it?""","cried Pavel, passionately, but in a low voice.","""Whose?",Tell me.,"Often I lie awake all night, and think how it is I have made such a mess of my life.",It's just through loving Vyera.,She took the place of mother and sister and wife and friends.,I loved her.,"I can't say in words how much, nor even write it on the skies in writing of stars.""","His eyes grew red, and two big tears rolled down his face.","He wiped them away with his sleeve, and went on, in a low voice: ""She lay in my way like a stone that I have stumbled over.""","""That is not right,"" said Lunev, who felt clearly that he pitied Vyera even more than his friend.","""What way do you speak of?",You had no way.,All that's just talk.,"You have longed for the mead, and praised it, that it was strong; now it has made you drunk, you blame it for getting into your head.",And how about her?,"Isn't she ill too?""","""Yes,"" said Pavel, then suddenly continued, his voice trembling with emotion, ""Do you think I'm not sorry for her?""","""Of course.","How can you help it?""","""I'm hard on her.",Is it much wonder?,"I sent her away; and when she went and began to cry, so softly and bitterly, then my heart was wrung.","I felt I should weep too, but I had no tears in my soul, only stones.",And then I began to think it all over.,"Ah, Ilya!","The life I live's no life at all.""","""Yes,"" said Lunev slowly, with a strange smile.","""Things go very oddly in life.",There's something takes us all by the throat and strangles--strangles us.,"There's Jakov, who's good.","His father makes his life a burden; they've married Mashutka to an old devil; you're here in hospital----"" Suddenly he smiled quietly, and said in a lower voice: ""I'm the only lucky one!",Fact!,"As soon as I wish for anything--pat, it comes!""","""How?""","asked Pavel, with curiosity and suspicion.","""Trust me.",I have luck.,"It draws me on and on.""","""I don't like the way you talk,"" said Pavel, and looked at Ilya searchingly.","""Are you laughing at yourself?""","""No, it's some one else who laughs at me,"" replied Ilya, and his brows contracted gloomily.","""There's some one somewhere, laughs at us all.",I could tell you things.,"Wherever I look, there's no justice anywhere.""","""I can see that,"" cried Pavel softly, but with intensity.","""Come, let's go into that corner, there.""","They went along the corridor, close together, looking into one another's eyes.","Red patches appeared in Pavel's cheeks, and his eyes sparkled brightly, as in the days when he was healthy.","""And I can see how we're robbed down to the last stitch,"" he whispered in Ilya's ear.","""Whatever you can see, none of it is for us.""","""That's true.""","""Everything for the others.",See--my little girl.,She was as good as my wife.,I need her all.,Every man wants his wife for himself.,"But I can't have mine, and she can't live for me, as she wanted.",Why?,Just because I am poor?,"Well, but I work, don't I?","I've slaved all my life, ever since I was ten years old.","Surely I may be allowed to live, at least!""","""Petrusha Filimonov lives without working, so easily and comfortably, and can have everything he wants, do whatever he likes.","Why is that?""","said Ilya, seconding his friend's speech, with a scornful laugh.","""The doctor shouts at me, as if I were a criminal--why?""",went on Gratschev.,"""He's an educated man.",He ought to treat people decently.,"I'm a man, surely.",Eh?,And so it comes.,"I turned Vyerka out, but I know quite well it's not her fault.""","""It's not the stick that gives the pain, but the one who uses it.""","They stayed in the dark corner close to the corridor window, whose panes were streaked with yellow colour, and here side by side they conversed in passionate words, each catching the other's thought as it flew.",The heavy groaning came again from far away.,"The monotonous moan was like the muffled tone of a bass string, plucked at regular intervals, which vibrates wearily and hopelessly, as though it knew that no living heart beats fit to understand and appease its melancholy, quivering lament.",Pavel was flaming with irritation over the buffets that life's heavy hand had dealt him.,"He too, vibrated, like that string, with excitement, and whispered hurriedly, disconnectedly his grievances and complaints, and Ilya felt that Pavel's words fell on his heart like sparks, stirring to life in his own breast something dark and contradictory, that constantly troubled him, now flaming up, now sinking down.","It seemed as though, in place of the dull, evil doubt, with which till now he had faced life, something else was suddenly kindled in his soul, brightening its darkness and shaping for it rest and relief for ever.","""Why is a man holy, if he's enough to eat?","is he always in the right, if he's educated?""","whispered Pavel, standing close to Ilya, and looking round him as though he were aware of the unknown enemy who had spoilt his life.","""See,"" he went on, ""if I am hungry, if I'm stupid, still I have a soul!",Or hasn't a hungry man a soul?,"I see that I have no decent, real life, they have ruined my life, they've cut short my wishes and set up barriers on all my ways, and why?""","""No one can say,"" cried Ilya harshly, ""and there's no one we could ask who would understand?","We are all strangers.""","""That's true, whom can we talk to?""","asked Pavel, with a despairing gesture, and was silent.","Lunev looked straight before him down the wide corridor, and sighed deeply.","The dull moaning was heard again, now they were silent, it sounded more clearly; it seemed to come from the breast of a big, strong man, struggling with great pain.","""Are you still with Olympiada?""",asked Pavel.,"""Yes, still,"" answered Ilya.","""And think,"" he added with a strange smile, ""Jakov has got on so well with his reading that now he's doubtful about God.""","""Really?""","""Yes, he's found such a book!","And you, what do you think about that?""","""I, you see,"" said Pavel, thoughtfully, ""I've never thought much about it.","I never go to church.""","""And I do think about it, I think a lot about it, and I cannot understand how God endures it all!""","And they began to talk again, short, disconnected sentences, and they remained absorbed in their conversation till an attendant came up to them and said severely to Lunev: ""Why are you hiding here?","eh?""","""I'm not hiding.""","""Don't you see all the visitors are gone?""","""I didn't notice.","Good-bye Pavel--give Jakov a look up.""","""Now then, get on--get on!""","""Come again soon, for God's sake!""",implored Gratschev.,"""I tell you, get on!""","and the attendant followed Ilya muttering: ""These fellows, loafers, hiding in corners.""","Lunev slackened his pace and as the attendant came up to him, he said quietly and maliciously: ""Don't growl, else I'll have to say, 'lie down dog!","lie down!'""","The attendant stopped suddenly, but Lunev went quickly on and felt an evil pleasure in having insulted a man.",In the street he fell again into brooding on the fate of his friends.,"Pavel, since he was a little lad had fended for himself, had been in prison, and tried all sorts of hard work.","What hunger and cold, what blows he had endured!",And now finally he had come to the hospital.,"Masha would hardly see happy days again, and Jakov the same; how should a being like Jakov keep a whole skin in this world?","Lunev saw that, as a matter of fact, of all the four he had the best of it.","But this consciousness brought him no comfort, he only smiled, and looked suspiciously about him.",XVII.,"Ilya settled quietly into his new dwelling-place, and his landlords interested him deeply.",The woman's name was Tatiana Vlassyevna.,"As gay as a little bird, and always ready to chatter, she had given the new lodger a complete description of her life before he had spent many days in the little room.","In the morning, while Ilya drank his tea, she bustled about in the kitchen, with skirts tucked up and sleeves rolled above her elbows, but gave many a smiling glance into his room, and said, cheerfully: ""We're not rich, my husband and I, but we've got education and intelligence.","I went to the progymnasium, and he was in the cadet corps, even if he didn't quite finish his time there.","But we want to be rich, and we'll manage it too.",We've no children; they're the big expense.,"I do the cooking and go to market, and I keep a maid for the rest, and she lives in the house, and gets a rouble and a half a month.","You see what a lot I save!""","She remained in the doorway and, shaking her curls, began to reckon: ""Cook's wages, three roubles, and what she'd cost, seven--makes ten roubles.",She'd steal at least three roubles' worth a month--thirteen roubles.,Then I let her room to you--eighteen roubles.,"That's the cost of a cook, you see.","Then I buy everything wholesale, butter--half a pood, flour--a whole sack, sugar by the loaf, and so on.",I save another twelve roubles that way--that's thirty.,"If I had a place at the police-station or telegraph office, I should only work as a cook; and now I cost my man nothing, and I'm proud of it.","One must understand how to arrange one's life, remember that, young man!""","She looked roguishly at Ilya with her laughing eyes, and he smiled with some embarrassment.","She pleased him, but yet inspired him with respect.","When he waked in the morning she was already working in the kitchen, with a pock-marked, undersized girl, who stared at her mistress and every one else, with colourless, frightened eyes.","In the evening, when Ilya came home, Tatiana opened the door to him, smiling and active, with a pleasant perfume surrounding her.","When her husband was at home he played the guitar, and she chimed in with her clear voice, or they played cards for kisses.","Ilya could hear everything in his room--the tones of the strings, gay or sentimental, the turning of the cards, and the kisses.","Their dwelling consisted of two rooms--the bedroom and another adjoining Ilya's apartment, which served the pair for dining and drawing-room, where they spent their evenings.","Clear birds' voices resounded from here in the mornings, the titmouse peeped, the siskin and thistle-finch sang for a wager, the bullfinch whistled in between, and, through it all, the linnet sounded his serious, gentle song.","Titiana's husband, Kirik Nikodimovitch Avtonomov, was a man of twenty-six years, tall and big, with a big nose and black teeth.","His good-tempered face was thick with pimples, and his watery blue eyes looked at everything with imperturbable calm.","His close-cropped light hair stood up like a brush on his head, and in his whole plump figure there was something helpless and comical.","His movements were clumsy, and immediately after his first greeting to Ilya, he said, for no particular reason: ""Do you like singing birds?""","""Very much.""","""Do you ever catch any?""","""No,"" answered Ilya, looking wonderingly at the inspector, who wrinkled his nose, thought a moment, then said: ""Used you ever to catch them?""","""No.""","""Never?""","""Never.""","Kirik Avtonomov smiled in a superior way, and said: ""You can't be said to like them, if you've never caught any.","Now, I love them, and have caught them often, and was dismissed from the cadet corps because of that.","I'd like to catch 'em now, but I don't want to get into trouble with my superiors, for though the love of singing birds is a noble passion, to catch them is not a proper occupation for an established man.",If I were in your shoes I'd catch siskins like anything.,The siskin's a jolly bird.,"That's why he's called God's bird.""","Avtonomov looked with the expression of an enthusiast into Ilya's face, and a certain embarrassment came over Ilya as he listened.","He felt as though the inspector spoke of bird-catching allegorically, with a hidden reference.",His heart palpitated and he pricked up his ears.,"But the sight of Avtonomov's watery blue eyes quieted him, he saw in a moment that the inspector was quite a harmless individual, without any subtlety; so he smiled politely, and murmured some reply or other.","The inspector was evidently taken with Ilya's modest demeanour and serious face, and said, smiling: ""Come and have tea with us of an evening, when you feel inclined.","We're simple people, without any style.",We'll have a game of cards.,We don't get many visitors.,"Visitors are all very well, but you have to treat them, and that's a nuisance and comes expensive.""","The longer Ilya observed the comfortable life of his landlords, the better it pleased him.","Everything they had was so solid and clean, their existence ran so easily and peacefully, and they were evidently much attached to one another.","The brisk little woman was like a tomtit, and her husband like a clumsy bullfinch, and their rooms were as tidy and pretty as a bird's nest.","When Ilya was home of an evening, he listened to their conversation, and thought: ""That's the kind of life!""","He sighed enviously, and dreamed more vividly of the time when he would open his shop and have a little bright room of his own.","He would keep birds, and live as in a dream, alone and quiet, peacefully and methodically.","The other side of the wall, Tatiana was telling her husband how she bought everything she needed in the market, how much she had spent, and how much saved, and he laughed pleasantly and praised her.","""Ah, the clever little woman!",My dear little bird!,"Come, give me a kiss!""","Then he would begin and relate all that had happened in the town, the processes he had drawn up, what the Chief of Police or any of his superiors had said.","They talked of the possibility of a rise of salary for him, and discussed minutely whether, in such an event, they ought to take a bigger house.",Ilya lay and listened till suddenly a melancholy weariness fell on him.,"The little blue room was too narrow; he looked restlessly round as if to seek the cause of his moodiness, then, unable longer to endure the weight that lay at his breast, he went to Olympiada, or loafed aimlessly in the streets.",Olympiada became more and more full of reproaches.,She plagued him with jealousy and more and more frequently they fell into contention.,"She grew thin, her eyes were sunken and looked darker, her arms were thinner, and all this was not pleasing to Ilya.","Still less, however, did he like the fact that of late she had begun to talk of conscience and God, and of going into a nunnery.","He did not believe in the genuineness of her words, for he knew she could not live without the society of men.","""You needn't pray for me if you take the veil,"" he said one day with a mocking smile.","""I'll manage my own sins alone.""",She looked at him full of fear and sadness.,"""Ilya, don't make a jest of it!""","""But I mean it.""","""You don't believe that I shall go to a nunnery?","You'll see, then you'll believe.""","""Not at all--I believe you; lots of people turn monks or nuns out of sheer wickedness.""",Olympiada grew angry with him and they quarrelled fiercely.,"""You unlucky, proud man!""","she cried, with sparkling eyes.","""Just wait!","However you stiffen your back in your pride, you'll be bent down!",What are you so proud of?,Your youth and your beauty?,"It will all go--all, and then you'll creep on the ground like a snake and beg for mercy.",'Have pity!',"and no one will care.""","She heaped reproaches on him, and her eyes grew so bloodshot that it seemed as though great drops of blood instead of tears would flow over her cheeks.","When they quarrelled she never spoke of Poluektov's murder, indeed, in her better moments she would bid him ""forget.""","Lunev wondered at this, and asked her one day after a quarrel: ""Lipa!","tell me, when you're angry, why do you never speak of the old man.""","She answered readily: ""Because that was really neither my doing nor yours.","Since they haven't found you out, it must have been his fate.","You were the instrument, not the force; you had no reason to strangle him, as you say yourself.","So he only met his due punishment through you.""",Ilya laughed incredulously.,"""O--Oh!",I thought that a man must either be a fool or a rascal--ha!,ha!,"Anything is right for him if only he wants to do it, and in the same way anything can be wrong.""","""I don't understand,"" said Olympiada, and shook her head.","""Where's the difficulty?""","asked Ilya, sighing and shrugging his shoulders.","""It's quite simple!","Show me any one thing in life that holds for every one; find anything that a clever man can't make either right or wrong; anything that stands fast, permanent; you can't.",That is what I meant to say.,"There is nothing fixed in life; it is all changing and confused, like a man's own soul--yes.""","""I don't understand,"" said the woman after a pause.","""And I understand so well,"" answered Ilya.","""That this is just the knot that strangles us all.""","At last, after one of the periodical quarrels, when Ilya had not been near Olympiada for four days, he received a letter from her; she wrote:     ""Good-bye, my dear Ilyusha, good-bye for ever; we shall     never meet again.","Don't look for me, you won't find me.",I'm     leaving this unlucky town by the next steamboat; here I have     destroyed my soul for ever.,"I'm going away, far away, and     shall never come back; don't think of me and don't wait for     me.","With all my heart, I thank you for the good you have     brought me, and the bad I will forget.",I must tell you the     plain truth.,"I'm not going into a nunnery, I'm going away     with young Ananyin, who has been entreating me for a long     time.","I have agreed at last, what does it matter to me?",We     go to the sea to a village where Ananyin has fisheries.,"He     is simple, and even means to marry me, good, silly boy!",Good-bye!,"We have met as if in a dream, and when I waked     there was nothing.",Forgive me too!,If you knew how my     heart burns with longing.,"I kiss you--you, the one man in     the world for me.",Don't be proud before men; we are all     unfortunate.,"I have grown calm, I, your Lipa, and I go as     though under the axe,--my heart pains me so.----     ""OLYMPIADA SCHLYKOVA.""","""I am sending you a token by the post, a ring.","Please wear     it.--O.S.""",Ilya read the letter and bit his lips till they smarted.,"He read it again and again, and the more often he read, the better it pleased him; it was at once a pain and a pleasure to read the big irregularly written characters.","Previously, Ilya had given little thought to determine what the nature might be of Olympiada's feelings for himself; now, however, he felt that she had loved him dearly and warmly, and as he read her letter he felt a deep peace sink into his heart.","But the peace gave way gradually to a sense of loss, and the consciousness that there was no one now to whom he could reveal the bitterness of his soul depressed him.","The image of this woman stood vividly before his eyes, he remembered her passionate caresses, her sensible talk, her jests, and more and more clearly he felt in his breast a harsh feeling of wretchedness.","He stood moodily by the window, looking into the garden, and there in the darkness the elder-bushes rustled softly, and the thin, thready twigs of the birch-trees waved to and fro.","From behind the wall the strings of the guitar resounded mournfully, and Tatiana sang in her high voice:     ""Let him who will search through the seas     To find the amber golden----"" Ilya held the letter in his hand and thought: ""She always said she was persistent, and that I brought her good fortune, and yet she has left me, so the fortune can not have been so very good after all.""","He felt himself in the wrong before Olympiada, and sorrow and compassion weighed heavy on his soul.","""But bring me back my little ring from out the deep blue sea,"" sounded behind the wall.",Then the inspector laughed aloud and the singer chimed in merrily from the kitchen.,"Then, however, she was silent.","Ilya felt her nearness, but dared not turn round to look, though he knew his room door was open.","He gave the rein to his thoughts, and stood motionless, feeling himself deserted.","The tree-tops in the garden shivered, and Lunev felt as though he had left the ground, and were floating out there in the cold twilight.","""Ilya Jakovlevitch, will you have your tea?""","""No,"" answered Ilya.",The solemn note of a bell resounded through the air.,The deep tone made the window panes quiver.,"Ilya crossed himself, remembered that it was long since he had been to church, and seized the occasion to get away from the house.","""I'm going to evening service,"" he called as he went out.","Tatiana stood in the doorway, her hands against the door-posts, and looked curiously at him.","Her inquiring glance confused Ilya, and as if excusing himself, he said: ""I haven't been to church for ever so long.""","""Very well.","I'll get the samovar ready by nine o'clock,"" she replied.","As he went, Lunev thought of young Ananyin.","He knew the man; he was a rich young merchant, partner in fish business--Ananyin Brothers--a thin, fair young man, with a pale face and blue eyes.",He had but recently come to the town and lived there at a great pace.,"""That is really living,"" thought Ilya bitterly, ""like a rich young man does--hardly out of the nest before he gets a mate for himself.""","He entered the church in a discontented mood, and chose a dark corner, where lay the ladder to light the chandeliers.","""O Lord, have mercy!""",came from the left-hand choir.,"A choir boy sang with a shrill, unpleasing voice, and could not keep in tune with the hoarse, deep bass voice of the precentor.","The lack of harmony embittered Ilya's mood still further, and roused a desire in him to seize the boy by the ears.","The heating stove made the corner very hot, it smelt of burning rags.","An old woman in a fur jacket, came up to him and said, grumbling: ""You're not in your right place, sir.""","Ilya looked at the fox tails adorning the collar of her jacket, and went to one side silently, thinking: ""Even in the church there's a special place for us.""","It was the first time he had been to church since the murder of Poluektov, and when he remembered this, involuntarily he shuddered.","He thought of his guilt and forgot everything else, though the idea no longer terrified him, but only filled him with sorrow and heaviness of soul.","""O Lord, have mercy!""",he whispered and crossed himself.,"The choir burst into loud, harmonious song.","The soprano voices, giving the words clearly and distinctly, rang under the dome like the clear, pleasant tones of sweet bells.","The altos vibrated like a ringing tense string, and against their continued sound, flowing on like a stream, the soprano notes quivered like the reflection of the sun on a transparent pool.","The full deep bass notes swept proudly through the church, supporting the children's song; from time to time the beautiful strong tones of the tenors pierced through, then again the children's voices rang out, and rose into the twilight of the dome, whence, serious and thoughtful, clad in white garments, the figure of the Almighty looked down, blessing the faithful with majestic outstretched hands.","The waves of sound and the scent of incense rolled up to Him, and flowed round Him, and it seemed as though He floated in the midst, and swept ever higher into the depths of boundless space.","When the music ceased, Ilya sighed deeply.","His heart was light, and he felt no fear nor repentance, not even the irritation that had disturbed him when he entered the church.",His thoughts flew far away from his own sins.,The music had cleansed and lightened his soul.,"He could not trust his own sensations, feeling so unexpectedly calm and peaceful, and he strove to awaken in himself a sense of remorse, but it was in vain.","Suddenly the thought darted through his mind: ""Suppose that woman goes into my room out of curiosity and looks about and finds the money.""","He hurried away out of the church, and hailed a droshky to reach home as quickly as he could.","All the way the thought tormented him, and set him in a quiver of excitement.","""Suppose they do find the money, what then?","They won't lay an information about it, they'll just steal it.""",And this thought roused him still more; he became quite positive that if it should happen he would go straight to the police in this same droshky and confess that he had murdered Poluektov.,"No, he would not any longer be tortured, and live in dirt and turmoil while others enjoy in peace and comfort the money for which he sinned so deeply.",The mere idea of it drove him nearly crazy.,"When the droshky drew up at his door, he darted out and tugged at the bell; his fist clenched and his teeth locked, he waited impatiently for the door to open.",Tatiana appeared on the threshold.,"""My, what a ring you gave!",What's the matter?,"What's wrong?""","she cried, frightened at the sight of him.","Without a word he pushed her aside, went quickly to his room, and assured himself in one glance, that his fears were unnecessary.","The money lay behind the upper window-boxing, and he had stuck on a little scrap of down, in such a way that it must be removed if any one tried to get at the packet.",He saw the white fleck at once against the brown background.,"""Aren't you well?""","asked his landlady, appearing at the door of his room.","""I'm all right; I beg your pardon, I pushed you.""","""That's nothing; but see here, how much is the droshky?""","""I don't know, ask him please, and pay him.""","She hurried away, and Ilya in a moment sprang on a chair, snatched away the packet of money, knew by the feel that it had not been tampered with, and dropped it in his pocket with a sigh of relief.","He was ashamed now of his anxiety, and the precaution of the scrap of down seemed foolish and ridiculous.","""Witchcraft!""","he thought, and laughed to himself.",Tatiana Vlassyevna appeared again.,"""I gave him twenty kopecks--but what's the matter?","were you faint?""","""Yes.","I was standing in the church, and then all at once----"" ""Lie down,"" she said, and came into the room.","""Lie down quietly.",Don't worry!,I'll sit by you a little.,I'm at home alone.,"My husband's working late and going on to his club.""","Ilya sat down on the bed, while she took the only chair.","""I disturbed you I'm afraid,"" said Ilya, with an embarrassed smile.","""Doesn't matter,"" she answered, and looked in his face with frank curiosity.",There was a pause.,Ilya did not know what to talk about.,"She still looked at him, and suddenly laughed in an odd way.","""What are you laughing at?""","said Ilya, and dropped his eyes.","""Shall I tell you?""","she asked, mischievously.","""Yes, tell me!""","""You can't pretend well, d'you know?""",Ilya started and looked at her uneasily.,"""No, you can't.",You are not ill; only you've had a letter that troubles you.,"I saw--I saw----"" ""Yes, I've had a letter,"" said Ilya slowly.",Something rustled in the branches outside.,"Tatiana looked quickly out at the window, then again at Ilya.","""It was only the wind, or a bird,"" she said.","""Now, young man, will you listen to my advice?","I'm only a young woman, but I'm not a fool!""","""If you'll be so good--please,"" said Lunev, and looked at her with curiosity.","""Tear up the letter and throw it away,"" she said in a decided tone.","""If she has written you your dismissal, she's acted well, and like a sensible girl.",It's too soon for you to marry.,"You've no settled standing, and you ought not to marry without.","You're a strong young man and you work, and you're good-looking.",You're bound to get on.,Only take care you don't fall in love.,"Earn a lot of money, and save, and try to get on to something bigger.","Open a shop, and then, when you've got firm ground under your feet, you can marry.",You're bound to get on.,"You don't drink, you're unassuming, you've no ties.""","Ilya listened, with bowed head and smiled quietly.",He longed to laugh out loud.,"""There's nothing more silly than to hang your head down,"" continued Tatiana, in the tone of an experienced man of the world.","""It will pass.",Love is a disease that is easily cured.,"Before I was married I fell in love three times, fit to drown myself, but it passed.","And when I saw that it was time for me to marry, I married without all that love.""","""Ilya raised his head and looked at the woman as she said this: ""What's the matter?""",she asked.,"""Afterwards I learnt to love my husband.","It happens often that a woman falls in love with her husband.""","""What does that mean?""","asked Ilya, opening his eyes.",Tatiana laughed gaily.,"""I was only joking--but quite seriously, you can really marry a man without love, and come to care for him afterwards.""",And she chattered away and made play with her eyes.,"Ilya listened attentively, and looked with great interest at the little, trim figure, and was full of wonder.","She was so small and slender and yet she had such foresight and strength of will, and good sense.","""With a wife like that,"" he thought, ""a man couldn't come to grief.""","He found it pleasant to sit there with an intelligent woman, a real, trim, neat housewife, who was not too proud to chat with him, a simple working lad.","A feeling of gratitude towards her arose in him, and when she got up to go, he sprang up at once, bowed, and said: ""Thank you very much for the honour you have done me; your talk has done me a lot of good.""","""Really, think of that!""","she said, smiling quietly, while her cheeks reddened and she looked for a second or two steadily in Ilya's face.","""Well then, good-bye for the present,"" she added with a strange intonation and slipped out with the easy gait of a young girl.",XVIII.,"Ilya came to like the Avtonomovs better every day, and he envied them their peaceful, sheltered life.","In a general way he had no love for police officials, for he saw many evil qualities among them.","But Kirik seemed like a simple working-man, good-tempered, if limited.","He was the body, and his wife the soul.","He was seldom at home, and not of much importance there.",Tatiana Vlassyevna became more and more at home with Ilya.,"She got him to chop wood, fetch water, empty away slops.","He obeyed dutifully, and these little services gradually became his daily duty.","Then his landlady dismissed the pock-marked girl who helped her, and only had her on Sundays.",Occasionally visitors came to the Avtonomovs.,"Korsakov, the assistant town inspector, often came, a thin man with a long moustache.","He wore dark glasses, smoked thick cigarettes, and could not endure droshky drivers, speaking of them always with great irritation.","""No one breaks rules and orders so often as these drivers,"" he used to say.","""Insolent brutes!",Foot passengers in the streets you can deal with easily; it only means a police notice in the papers.,"Those going down the street keep to the right, those going up to the left, and at once you get excellent discipline.","But these drivers, you can't get at them with any notice.","A driver, well, the devil only knows what he's like!""","He could talk of droshky drivers a whole evening, and Lunev never heard him speak of anything else.","Also the inspector of the Orphan Asylum, Gryslov, came occasionally, a silent man, with a black beard.","He loved to sing, in his bass voice, the song: ""Over the sea, the deep blue sea,"" and his wife, a stately, stout woman with big teeth, always ate up the whole provision of sweetmeats, a feat which occasioned remarks after her departure.","""Felizata Segarovna does that on purpose.","Whatever sweets come on the table, she always swallows the lot.""",Alexandra Fedorovna Travkina used to come with her husband.,"She was tall and thin, with a large nose and short red hair.","She had big eyes and a piping voice, and blew her nose frequently with a sound like the tearing of calico.","Her husband suffered from a disease of the throat, and spoke in consequence in a whisper.","But he would talk incessantly by the hour, and the sounds that came from his mouth were like the rustling of dry straw.","He was very well-to-do, had served in the Excise Department, and was a director of a flourishing benevolent society.",Both he and his wife spoke of little else but charitable institutions.,"""Just think what has just happened in our society!""","""Ah, yes, yes.","Just imagine!""",cried his wife.,"""An appeal has been presented for assistance.""","""I tell you, these charitable institutions ruin the people----"" ""A woman writes, her husband is dead.",She has three children.,"They are starving and she is always ill."" ""The old story, you know----"" ""They were to get three roubles----"" ""But, for my part, I don't believe in this widow,"" cried Alexandra Fedorovna, triumphantly.","""My wife says to me, 'Wait,' she says: 'I'll see first what kind of a person it is.'""","""And what do you think?","The husband had been dead five years.""","""She's two children, not three.""","""The things they say!""","""And she's as healthy as can be.""","""Then I said to her: 'See now, my friend, how would you like to be tried for fraud?'","Of course, she fell at my feet.""","""Ha!",ha!,"ha!""",laughed Kirik Avtonomov.,"And every one praised Fedorovna for her acuteness, and blamed the poor, because of their lying and greed, and want of respect towards their benefactors.","Lunev sat in his room, and listened attentively to the conversations that went on close by.",He wanted to understand what these people thought and said of life.,But what he heard was incomprehensible to him.,"It seemed as though these people had made up their minds about life, had settled all questions, and knew everything; and they condemned in the strongest terms every one who lived differently from themselves.","Most frequently, they talked of all kinds of family scandals, of different services in the cathedral, or of the evil behaviour of their acquaintances.",It wearied Ilya to listen.,Sometimes his landlord invited him to tea in the evening.,"Tatiana Vlassyevna was merry, and her husband waxed enthusiastic over the possibility of becoming rich, when he would retire from the service and buy himself a house.","""Then I'd keep fowls,"" he said, and screwed up his eyes.","""All sorts of fowls--Brahmahpootras, Cochin Chinas, Guinea-fowl, and turkeys--and a peacock--yes.","Think of sitting at the window in a dressing-gown, smoking a scented cigarette, and seeing the peacock, my own peacock, in the courtyard, spreading his tail.",That would be something like a life.,"He'd stalk round like a police officer, and say: 'Brr--Brrll--Brrll!'""","Tatiana smiled, and, looking at Ilya, went on in her turn: ""And every summer I'd go away somewhere, to the Crimea or the Caucasus, and in winter I'd be on some charitable committee.","Then I'd have a black cloth dress, quite simple with no ornament, and I wouldn't wear any jewels except a ruby brooch and pearl ear-rings.","I read a poem in the 'Niva,' where it said, 'that the blood and tears of the poor are turned to rubies and pearls,'"" then with a soft sigh, she added, ""Rubies look so nice on dark women.""",Ilya smiled and said nothing.,"It was warm and clean in the room, an odour of tea and of some pleasant scent mingled in the air.","The birds, little feather balls, were asleep in the cages.",A few gaudy pictures hung on the walls.,"A little étagère between the two windows was covered with all kinds of pretty little boxes, china birds, and gay Easter eggs of sugar or glass.","The whole place pleased Ilya and filled him with a kind of soft, comfortable melancholy.","Sometimes however, especially when he had earned little or nothing, this melancholy changed into a restless fretfulness.",Then the china fowls and the eggs and the boxes annoyed him; he wanted to throw them on the ground and smash them.,This mood disturbed and frightened him; he could not understand it and it seemed strange and unlike himself.,"As soon as it came upon him, he maintained an obstinate silence, kept his eyes fixed on one spot, and was afraid to speak lest he should somehow hurt the feelings of these good people.","Once, however, as he was playing cards with them, he could not contain himself, and asked Kirik drily, looking him straight in the face: ""I say, Kirik Nikodimovitch, you've never caught him--the murderer of the merchant in Dvoryanskaya Street?""",As he spoke he felt a pleasant tingling in his breast.,"""Poluektov, the money-changer?""","said the inspector, thoughtfully, as he examined his cards.","""Poluektov?",Ah!,ah!,No!,I have not caught Poluektov--ah!,"I haven't caught him, my friend; that's to say, of course, not Poluektov, but the man who----I haven't even looked for him.","I don't want him, anyhow--I only want to know who has the queen of spades?","You, Tanya, played three cards--queen of clubs, queen of diamonds and--what was the other?""","""Seven of diamonds--hurry up!""","""He's quite lost!""","said Ilya, and laughed scornfully.","But the inspector paid no attention to him, he was absorbed in the game.","""Quite lost,"" he repeated mechanically, ""and he twisted poor Poluektov's neck--ah!","ah!""","""Kirya, do stop that, ah!","ah!""",said his wife.,"""Be quick!""","""Patience, patience.""","""He must be a smart fellow who murdered him,"" remarked Ilya.",The indifference with which his words were received roused in him a desire to speak of the murder.,"""Smart?""",said the inspector slowly.,"""No!",I am the smart fellow!,"There!""","and he played a five, slapping the card down on the table.","Ilya could not follow suit, and lost the round.","The husband and wife laughed at him, and he grew more restive.","As he was dealing, he said defiantly: ""To kill a man in broad daylight, in the main street of the town, that takes some courage.""","""Luck, not courage,"" Tatiana corrected.","Ilya looked first at her, then at her husband, laughed softly and asked: ""You call it luck to kill some one?""","""Why, yes; to kill some one and not get caught.""","""You've given me ace of diamonds again,"" cried the inspector.","""I could do with an ace,"" said Ilya seriously.","""Kill a rich man, that's the best ace!""",said Tatiana jokingly.,"""Hold on a bit with your killing, here's an ace of cards to go on with,"" cried Kirik, with a loud laugh and played two nines and an ace.","Ilya glanced again at their pleasant, happy faces, and the desire to speak further of the murder left him.","Living side by side with these people, separated only by a thin wall from their sheltered, peaceful life, Ilya was seized more and more frequently with fits of painful dissatisfaction.","The feeling poured over him like a dense, cold flood, and he could not understand whence it came.","At the same time thoughts of life's contradictions rose up in him, of God who knows everything, yet does not punish but waits patiently.",Why does He wait?,Out of sheer boredom he began to read again.,"His landlady had a couple of volumes of the ""Niva,"" and the ""Illustrated Review,"" and a few other odd volumes.","Just as in his childhood, so now, he cared only for tales and romances, in which a strange unknown life was depicted, and not at all for representations of the real, the wrong and misery filling the life that surrounded him.","Whenever he read tales of actual life, dealing with simple folk, he found them wearisome and full of false descriptions.","Sometimes it is true they amused him, when it seemed as though these tales were written by clever people, anxious to paint this miserable, dull, grey life in fair colours and gloss over its wretchedness.",He knew this life and daily learned to know it better.,As he passed through the streets he never failed to see something that appealed to his critical faculties.,"In this way once he witnessed a scene on his way to visit his friend at the hospital which he related to Pavel: ""This is what they call law and order.",I saw some people like carpenters and plasterers going along the pavement.,Up comes a policeman.,"'Now then, you rascals!'","he shouts, and turns them off into the road.","That's to say, walk with the horses, else your dirty clothes may soil the fine gentry; build me a house, oh, yes, but I'll chuck you out of it, ah!""","Pavel's wrath was aroused too, by the incident, and added fuel to Ilya's flame.","He endured tortures in the hospital, little better to him than a prison; his thoughts would not let him rest, and his eyes glowed with despair and grim defiance.","To think where Vyera might then be, consumed him, and he grew thin and wasted.","Jakov he did not like, and avoided his society in spite of the wearisomeness that plagued him.","""He's half silly,"" he answered when Ilya asked after Jakov.","But Jakov, two of whose ribs it appeared were broken, lived very happily in the hospital.","He had made friends with the patient next him, a servant in a church, whose leg had been amputated a little while before for sarcoma.","He was a short, thick-set man, with a big bald head and a black beard that covered his breast.","His eyebrows were thick and bushy, and he moved them constantly up and down; his voice sounded hollow as though it came from his stomach.","Every time Lunev visited the hospital he found Jakov by the bedside of this man, who lay and moved his eyebrows without speaking, while Jakov read half-aloud out of a Bible, that was as short and thick as its owner.","""'Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence,'"" read Jakov.","""'Because in the night Kin of Moab is laid waste and brought to silence.'""","Jakov's voice sounded weak and creaking, like the noise of a saw cutting wood.","As he read, he held up his left hand, as if to summon all the patients in the ward to hear the calamitous prophecies of Isaiah.","The blue bruises were not yet quite gone from his face, and the big, thoughtful eyes in the midst of them gave him a very strange expression.","As soon as he saw Ilya, he threw down the book, and always asked the same anxious question: ""Haven't you seen Mashutka?""",Ilya had not seen her.,"""O God!""",said Jakov sadly.,"""How strange it is!",Like a fairy tale!,"She was there, and suddenly a magician snatches her away, and she's disappeared.""","""Has your father been to see you?""","""Yes--he came again.""","A shiver passed over Jakov's face, and he looked anxiously here and there.","""He brought a pound of cakes, and tea and sugar.","'You've loafed round here enough,' he said, 'let them send you out!'",But I begged the doctors not to send me away yet.,"It's so jolly here, quiet and comfortable.",This is Nikita Jegarowitch.,We read together.,He has a Bible.,He's read it for seven years.,He knows it all by heart and can explain the prophecies.,"When I'm well, I'm going to leave my father and live with Nikita.","I'll help him in the church and sing in the choir.""","The church servant lifted his eyebrows, underneath which a pair of big dark eyes moved slowly in deep sockets.","Quiet and lustreless, they looked at Ilya's face with a fixed, dull look, and Ilya tried involuntarily to avoid them.","""What a lovely book the Bible is!""","said Jakov, quite enraptured, Mashka, his father, and all his dreams forgotten.","""What things it says, brother!","What words!""","His widely-opened eyes glanced from the book to Ilya's face and back again, and he shook with excitement.","""And that saying is in it--do you remember?--that the old preacher said to your uncle in the bar--'The tabernacles of robbers prosper!'","--It's there, I found it, and things worse than that!""","Jakov shut his eyes and said solemnly, with uplifted hand: ""'How oft is the candle of the wicked put out, and how oft cometh destruction upon them!","God distributed sorrows in his anger'--Do you hear?--'God layeth up his iniquity for his children: He rewardeth him and he shall know it.'""","""Does it really say that?""","said Ilya, incredulously.","""Word for word.""","""Then I think that is--not right--wicked,"" said Ilya.","The church servant drew down his bushy brows till they shaded his eyes, his beard moved up and down, and he spoke clearly in a dull, strange voice: ""The boldness of the man who seeks the Truth is not sinful, for it springs from divine prompting.""",Ilya shuddered.,"The speaker sighed deeply, and went on, slowly and distinctly: ""'The Truth itself bids a man seek Me!","For Truth is God, and it is written: It is a great glory to follow the Lord.'""","The man's face, covered with thick hair, inspired Ilya with shyness and respect.","There was in it something strong, sublime.","His brows went up again, he looked at the ceiling, and his big beard moved again: ""Read him, Jakov, from the Book of Job, the beginning of the tenth chapter.""","Jakov turned over the leaves quickly, and read, in a low, trembling voice: ""'My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.","I will say unto God, do not condemn me: Show me wherefore thou contendest with me.","Is it good unto Thee that Thou shouldest oppress; that Thou shouldest despise the work of Thine hands?'""",Ilya stretched out his neck and looked at the book with blinking eyes.,"""You don't believe it?""",cried Jakov.,"""How silly you are!""","""Not silly, only cowardly,"" said the church servant, quietly, ""because he cannot look God in the face.""","He turned his dull eyes from the ceiling to Ilya's face, and went on sternly as though he would shatter him with words.","""There are parts that are more difficult than that one.",The third verse of the twenty-second chapter says plainly: 'Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous?,or is it gain to Him that thou makest thy ways perfect?',"You need to think very diligently, so as not to go astray in these matters and to understand them.""","""And you, do you understand?""",asked Lunev softly.,"""He?""",cried Jakov.,"""Nikita Jegarowitch understands everything.""","But the church servant said, sinking his voice lower: ""For me, it's too late already.","It is time for me to understand death; they've taken off my leg, but it's swelling higher up, and the other leg is swelling, and my breast, and I shall soon die of it.""","His eyes stared steadily at Ilya and he continued slowly and quietly: ""And I do not want to die yet, for I have lived wretchedly in sickness and bitterness, with no joy in my life.","I've worked ever since I was a little boy, and like Jakov, under the scourge of a father.",He was a drunkard and a brute.,"Three times he damaged my skull, once he scalded my leg with boiling water.","I had no mother, she died when I was born.",I married; I was compelled to take a wife who did not love me; three days after the wedding she hanged herself.,Yes.,"I had a brother-in-law who robbed me, and my own sister said to my face that I drove my wife to her death.","And they all said it, although they knew I had not touched her, that she died a maid.","Then I lived nine years, alone and solitary.",It is terrible to live alone.,"I've always waited for happiness to come at last, and now I'm dying.","That is my whole life.""","He closed his eyes, paused a moment, then asked: ""Why was life given to me?","Guess that riddle.""","Ilya listened, pale, with fear in his heart.",A dark shadow lay on Jakov's face and tears glimmered in his eyes; both were silent.,"""Why was I born?",I ask.,The Lord has done me wrong.,I do not pray that He will lengthen my life.,I find no words to pray with.,"I lie here and think and think: Why has life been given to me?""",His voice choked.,"He broke off all at once, like a muddy brook that flows along and suddenly vanishes under ground.","""For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion,"" said the church servant after a while in the words of the Scripture; then again his eyebrows went up, his eyes opened and his beard moved.","""Also in Ecclesiastes it says: 'In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity, consider.",God also hath set the one over against the other to the end that man should find nothing after him.',"Well?""",Ilya could hear no more.,"He got up quietly, gave Jakov a hand, bowed low to the sick man, as though he were taking leave of the dead; and this he did involuntarily.","This time he left the hospital with a new, strangely oppressive feeling.","The talk with the church servant had left no clear impression on his brain, but the mournful spectacle the sick man presented was stamped deep on his memory.","Another was added to the men, he knew, whose lives had proved a delusion.","He held the words of this man clear in his memory, and turned them over and over to get at their secret meaning.","They confused him and disturbed something in the depths of his soul, where he hid his faith in the justice of God, and these words which he could not fathom, awaked in him a bitter gnawing brain-activity that drove him on to examine and analyse all that he saw or experienced.","It appeared to him now that somehow, in a way unknown to himself, his faith in the justice of God had sustained a shock and was no longer so firm as of old.","Something had gnawed at it, like the rust gnaws the iron.","He felt clearly that this had happened; the fierce commotion into which the lament of the church servant had thrown him, convinced him.","There were sensations and ideas in his breast as irreconcilable as fire and water, continually at strife.","His bitterness against his own past, against all men and all the laws of life, broke out with new strength.","In his anger he came finally to the question: ""Thoughts grow in the soul like roots in the ground, but where is the fruit?""","He would gladly have torn all these troubles from his heart, that he might begin the realisation of his dream of a solitary, peaceful, sheltered life.","""I will mix with men no more.",It's no good to me or any one.,"I can't live like this.""","He took to wandering the streets for hours, and came back home tired and moody.",Every day the Avtonomovs became more friendly and obliging to Ilya.,"Kirik clapped him on the shoulder, jested with him, and said, in a tone of conviction: ""You busy yourself with useless things, my friend.",So modest and serious a lad must take a wider view.,"It isn't good to remain district inspector if you're fit to look after the whole town.""","Tatiana, too, began to ask Ilya definitely and in detail, how his peddling trade did, and how much he put by every month.","He talked freely to her, and his respect for this woman, who could make so tidy and comfortable a life out of small possibilities, grew every day.","One evening, as he sat by the open window of his room, in a dark mood, looking at the garden and thinking of the faithless Olympiada, Tatiana Vlassyevna came out of her dining-room to the kitchen and called Ilya to tea.",He accepted the invitation against his will.,"He could not break free from his moodiness, and had no inclination to talk.","He sat at the table, sulky and silent, and, looking at his hostess, noticed that her face wore an unusually solemn and troubled expression.","Neither spoke; the samovar bubbled cheerily, a bird fluttered in a cage, the air was full of the scent of fried onions and eau-de-Cologne.","Kirik twisted about on his chair, drummed with his fingers on the edge of the tea-tray, and sang under his breath.","""Ilya Jakovlevitch,"" began his wife, with an important air, ""we--my husband and I--have arranged a little matter, and would like to talk seriously with you.""","""Ho!",ho!,"ho!""","laughed the inspector suddenly, and rubbed his big red hands.",Ilya started and looked at him in surprise.,"""Wait, Kirik!","There's nothing to laugh at,"" said Tatiana.","""_We've_ arranged it,"" cried Kirik, with a big laugh, then looked at Ilya and winked towards his wife.","""Clever little girl!""","""We've saved some money----"" ""_We!",We've_ saved money!,Ho!,ho!,ho!,"My clever, dear little wife!""","""Kirya, be quiet!""","said Tatiana, severely.",Her face seemed thinner and more pointed than ever.,"""We have saved close on a thousand roubles,"" she went on half aloud, and bent over towards Ilya and looked him full in the face with her sharp little eyes.","He sat quiet, but in his breast something seemed to jump for joy.","""The money's in the bank, and brings us four per cent,"" went on Tatiana.","""And that's too little, devil take it!""","cried Kirik, and struck the table with his hand.","""We want----"" His wife silenced him with a reproving look.","""Naturally, we are quite satisfied with this return, but we should like to help you in case you care to start on a bigger scale.","You are so steady----"" She paid Ilya a compliment or two, and then proceeded: ""They say that a fancy ware shop can bring in twenty per cent., or even more if you go about it the right way.","Now, we are ready to find you the money for a bill of exchange, at sight, of course, on condition that you open a shop.","You will manage it under my supervision, and we'll halve the profits.","You will insure the goods in my name, and you'll give me besides a document of some sort, nothing of importance.","And now, think over the matter, and tell us simply--yes or no.""","Ilya listened to the thin, clear voice, and rubbed his forehead hard.",While she spoke he looked many times at the corner where the golden frame of the eikon shone between the two wedding candles.,He felt a kind of helplessness and fear as he listened to his hostess's words.,Her proposal all at once assured his dream of years.,It astonished him and filled him with joy.,"Smiling in confusion, he looked at the little woman and thought: ""That's it, it's Fate.""","She spoke now in a motherly tone: ""Consider it well, look at it from all sides!","whether you have confidence in yourself, if you have enough strength--enough experience for it?","And then tell us, what could you put to it besides your work,--our money won't go so very far, will it?""","""I can,"" said Ilya slowly, ""put in five hundred roubles.",My uncle will give them to me--I have an uncle--I told you.,"He'll give me the money, perhaps more.""","""Hurrah!""",cried Kirik.,"""Then is it a bargain?""",asked Tatiana.,"""Yes.","I agree,"" said Lunev.","""Well, I should think so!""",cried the inspector.,"Then he put his hand in his pocket and called out: ""Now, let's have some champagne.","Ilya, my boy, run to the wine merchant, and bring some champagne.","Let's crack a bottle,--here's the money, you're our guest, of course.","Ask for Don Champagne at ninety kopecks, and say it's for me, for Avtonomov, then they'll give it you for sixty-five,--hurry up, my lad!""",Ilya looked smilingly at the beaming faces of the couple and went.,"So Fate had pushed him and buffeted him, led him to grievous sin, troubled his soul, and now suddenly she seemed to ask his forgiveness, to smile on him and offer her favours.","Now before him the way lay open to a sheltered corner in life, where he could live quietly and find peace for his soul.","He had taken a man's life, and for that he would help many and so make amends before the Lord.","No, the Lord would not punish him severely, for He knows all.","Olympiada was right; in the murder he was only the instrument, not the will, and evidently the Lord Himself was helping him to straighten his course, since he had made easy the attainment of his life's desire.","Thoughts whirled through Ilya's head as in a happy dance, and inspired his heart with joys of life unknown till now.",He brought from the wine shop a bottle of real champagne for which he paid seven roubles.,"""Oho!""","cried Avtonomov, ""that's what I call proper, my boy; that's an idea!",Ha!,"yes.""","Tatiana thought differently; she shook her head disparagingly and said in a tone of reproach, looking at the bottle: ""Seven roubles!",Ei--ei!,"Ilya Jakovlevitch, how unpractical, how foolish!""","Lunev stood before her, happy, deeply stirred; he smiled and said joyfully: ""It's real champagne,--for the first time in my life I'll drink something real.",What's my life been up to now?,"All spoilt, dirt and coarseness, and stuffiness, injuries and insults, and all kinds of torment.",Is that a real life do you suppose?,"Can any one go on living like that?""","He touched the sore place in his heart; his words rang bitterly, his eyes grew gloomy; he sighed deeply, and went on firmly and decidedly: ""Ever since I was small I've looked for the real thing and have lived all the time like a wood-shaving in a brook.","I was swept about, now here, now there, and all round me everything was dull and dirty and restless.","I didn't know where to catch hold; only misery and injustice and knavishness all round me, and all that disgusts me: and now fate brings me to you, for the first time in my life I see how people can live in peace and comfort and love.""",He looked at them with a bright smile and bowed to them.,"""I thank you.","With you I've found relief for my soul, by God!","You've helped me for my whole life, now I can step out boldly, now I know how a man should live!",It will go well with me and no other shall suffer for me.,How many unlucky ones there are in the world!,how many go under.,"I've seen it all, I know it all.""","Tatiana Vlassyevna regarded him with the look of the cat who lies in wait for the bird, ravished by his own song.","A greenish fire gleamed in her eyes and her lips twitched; Kirik was busy with the bottle, he had it between his knees and bent over it.",The veins of his neck swelled and his ears moved.,"""My friends,"" continued Ilya, ""for I have two friends----"" The cork popped, hit the ceiling and fell on the table; a glass that it fell against rang, quivering.","Kirik smacked his lips, filled the glasses and commanded: ""Ready.""","Then when his wife and Lunev had taken their glasses, he held his high over his head and cried: ""To the firm of Tatiana Avtonomov and Lunev; may it bloom and flourish!","Hurrah!""",XIX.,The following days were spent by Lunev and Tatiana Vlassyevna in arranging together the details of the new undertaking.,She knew everything and spoke of everything with as much certainty as if she had dealt in fancy wares all her life.,"Ilya listened with amazement, smiled and was silent.","He wanted to find a suitable place to make a beginning as soon as possible, and he agreed to all Tatiana's proposals, without considering their significance at all.","At last everything was settled, and it appeared that Tatiana had a suitable shop ready chosen.","It was arranged exactly as Ilya had imagined to himself, in a clean street, small and neat, with a room at the back.","Ilya knew the shop; there had formerly been a milk shop there, and he had often visited it with his wares.","Everything went splendidly, down to the least detail, and Ilya was triumphant, energetic, and happy.",He visited his friends in the hospital.,"Pavel met him, cheerful for once.","""To-morrow I'm to be discharged!""","he explained with joyful excitement, even before he answered Ilya's greeting.","""I've had a letter from Vyerka.","She grumbles, says I insulted her, little devil!""",His eyes shone and his cheeks reddened.,"He could not keep still a moment, but shuffled with his slippers on the ground and flourished with his hands.","""Take care of yourself,"" said Ilya.","""Be careful.""","""Of course.","I shall simply say: 'Mam'selle Vyera Kapitanovna, will you marry me?",Please!,"No?--then there's a knife in your heart!'""",A convulsive shudder passed over his face.,"""Come, come!""","said Ilya, laughing.","""What, threaten her with a knife straight away?""","""No--believe me, I've had enough of it.",I can't live without her.,And she too; she's no good without me; she's had enough of her beastly life.,She must be sick of it.,"To-morrow it shall be settled between us, this way or that.""","Lunev looked at his friend's face and thought: ""In a mood like this he might kill her.""","Suddenly a clear, simple idea came into his head.","He blushed, then smiled.","""Pashutka, think, I've made my fortune,"" he began after a pause, and told his friend shortly what had happened to him.","Pavel listened, sighed with bent head, and said: ""Ye--es, you are lucky!""","""Envious?""","""Rather!","Devil take it!""","""Really, I'm ashamed of my luck with you, speaking quite honestly.""","""Thank you!""","said Pavel, with a dull laugh.","""Do you know?""","said Ilya slowly, ""I'm not boasting.",I mean it.,"I am ashamed, by God!""","Pavel glanced at him without speaking, and hung his head lower.","""And I'll say something to you.",We've hung together in bad times.,"Let us share the good times.""","""H--m--m!""",growled Pavel.,"""I've heard that happiness can't be shared, any more than a woman's love.""","""Oh, yes, it can!","Just you find out all that is wanted to set up as a well-sinker--instruments and so on--and how much it costs, and I'll find the money.""","""Wha--at!""","cried Pavel, looking at his friend incredulously.","Lunev seized his hand with a lively gesture, and pressed it.","""Really, you silly!","I'll find it for you.""",But it needed a long conversation to assure Pavel of the seriousness of his intentions.,"Pavel kept shaking his head, growling, and saying: ""No, it'll come to nothing.""",Finally Lunev succeeded in convincing him.,"Then Pashka embraced him, and said, in a voice full of emotion: ""Thank you, brother!",You'll pull me out of the pit.,"Now, listen to me.",A workshop of my own--that's not for me.,"Give me some money, and I'll take Vyerka and go away from here.","It will be easier for you, and you won't need to give me so much, and it'll suit me better.","I'll go off somewhere and get an assistant's job in a workshop.""","""That's ridiculous,"" said Ilya.","""It's much better to be your own master.""","""What sort of a master should I be?""",cried Pavel.,"""I don't know how to deal with workmen like a master.","No, a business of my own, and all that goes with it, is not to my taste.","I know the sort of fellow a man must be for

Jakov?""","""Same as before; we can't hit it off,"" said Gratschev laughing.","""He's an unlucky fellow.","It's not easy to deal with him,"" said Ilya thoughtfully.","""Ah, we've most of us something to put up with,"" answered Pavel, and shrugged his shoulders.","""He always seems to me not quite all there, half silly.","Well, I'm off.""","""Good-bye, then.""","And when Ilya had already left him, he called after him once more from the passage: ""Thank you, brother!""",Ilya nodded to him with a smile.,He found Jakov quite sorrowful and cast down.,"He lay on his bed, his face upturned to the ceiling, looking up with wide-open eyes, and did not notice Ilya's approach.","""Nikita Jegarovitch's gone to another ward,"" he said gloomily.","""That's a mercy,"" answered Lunev.","""He really looked too terrible, and then he said such odd things!","God be with him!""","Jakov looked at him reproachfully, but said nothing.","""Getting on?""",asked Ilya.,"""Ye--es,"" answered Jakov with a

forgot.","I can't remember everything.""","""You must remember with your heart.""",Lunev was embarrassed and said nothing.,"A little man on crutches wearing a moustache with pointed ends, hobbled in out of the corridor, and said in a hoarse, hissing voice to the tall man with the bandaged head: ""Schurka has not come again, the rascal.""","Jakov looked at him, sighed and threw his head backwards and forwards on the pillow restlessly.","""Nikita Jegarovitch will die, and he doesn't want to,--the surgeon told me, he must die, and I want to die, and I can't.","I shall get well again and go behind the counter, and drink brandy and so I go down.""",His lips lengthened into a melancholy smile.,"""To endure this life, a man needs an iron body and an iron heart, and he must live like all the rest, without thinking, without conscience.""","Ilya detected in Jakov's words something hostile and cold, and his brow wrinkled.","""And I'm a glass between stones,"" Jakov continued, ""if I turn, there's a smash.""","""You grumble far too much,"" said Lunev carelessly.","""And what about you?""",asked Jakov.,Ilya turned away and did not speak.,"Then observing that Jakov showed no signs of going on, he said thoughtfully: ""It's hard for us all.","Look at Pavel, for instance.""","""I don't like him,"" said Jakov, and made a grimace.","""Why not?""","""Oh!","Just I don't like him.""","""Well, I do.""","""I don't care.""","""H'm--yes--well, I must be off.""","Jakov held out his hand in silence, and then implored, in a tearful, entreating voice: ""Do find out about Mashutka, will you?","for Christ's sake!""","""Yes.","I will,"" said Ilya.","It disturbed and worried him to listen to Jakov's eternal complaints, and he felt relieved when he got away from him.","But the entreaty to find out about Masha roused a certain feeling of shame in him for his conduct towards Perfishka's daughter, and he determined to look up Matiza, as she was certain to know how Mashutka was taking to her new life.","Like all the people in Petrusha's house, he knew that Matiza used to wash the floors every Saturday at the house of Ehrenov, receiving a quarter-rouble for the task, and also for granting more personal favours.","Ilya took the road towards Filimonov's tavern, and his soul was full of thoughts of his future.","It seemed to smile sweetly on him, and lost in his fancies, he passed the tavern without noticing, and when he discovered his mistake felt no inclination to turn back.","He went on right out of the town; the fields stretched away in front of him, bounded far off by the dark wall of the forest.",The sun was setting; its rosy reflection gleamed on the tender green of the turf.,"Ilya strode forward with head high and looked up to the sky, where purple clouds stood almost motionless, flaming in the sun's rays.","He felt at ease, wandering thus aimlessly; every step forward, every breath awakened a new thought.","He imagined himself rich and mighty and with the power to ruin Petrusha Filimonov, in his dream he had brought him to beggary, and Petrusha stood before him weeping, but he addressed the suppliant: ""Have compassion, should I?","And you, have you ever had compassion on a soul?","Have you not maltreated your son, and led my uncle into sin?",Have you not looked down on me and despised me?,"In your accursed house no one has ever been happy, no one has ever known joy.","Your house is rotten through and through, a trap for men, a prison for those that live in it.""","Petrusha stood there, shivering and groaning with fear, lamenting like a beggar and Ilya thundered on at him: ""I will burn your house, for it brings misery to all who dwell in it, and do you go out in the world and beg forgiveness from all that you have wronged; go, wander till the day of your death, and then die of hunger, like a dog!""","The evening twilight had fallen on the fields, the forest rose in the distance like a thick dark wall, like a mountain range.","A little bat flitted noiselessly through the air like a dark speck, seeming to sow the darkness.","Far off on the river was heard the beating noise of a steamboat's paddles; it was as though somewhere in the distance a monstrous bird were wheeling, making the air tremble with mighty strokes of its wings.","Lunev remembered all the people who had opposed him on his way through life, and haled them all without mercy before his judgment seat.","A pleasant sense of relief came to him, and as he strode alone through the fields, wrapped now in darkness, he began to sing softly.",Suddenly the odour of rubbish and decay filled the air.,He stopped singing; but the odour had only pleasant associations for him.,"He had reached the town rubbish-heap, in the narrow valley where he had so often searched with Jeremy.",The stench seemed to him more penetrating and suffocating than in his childhood.,"The vision of the old rag-picker rose in his memory, and he glanced round to find in the twilight the spot where the old man used to rest with him.",But he could not find it; evidently it was buried under new mountains of refuse and rubbish.,"He sighed, and felt that there was a part of his soul smothered beneath the refuse of life.","""If only I hadn't killed that man; then I should want nothing.""","The thought flashed through his brain; but immediately from his heart came another, answering: ""What has that man to do with my life?","He is only my misfortune, not my sin.""","Suddenly there was a slight rustling, a little dog slipped past Ilya's feet, and fled, whimpering softly.","Ilya shuddered; he felt as though a part of this darkness of night had taken life and then vanished again, groaning.","""It's all the same,"" he thought.","""Even without that, there'd be no peace in my heart.",How many injuries I have endured; how many more I have seen others bear!,"Once the heart is wounded, it never ceases to feel pain.""",He paced slowly along the edge of the valley.,His feet sank in the dust.,He could hear the wood-shavings and pieces of paper rustle and crackle as he walked.,"An open part of the ground, not yet encumbered with rubbish, led away into the valley like a narrow tongue of land.","He went to the end of it, and there sat down.","Here the air was fresher, and as his eyes travelled along the gully, they rested far off on the steely ribbon of the river.","The lights of invisible vessels glimmered on the water, which seemed as still as ice, and one light swayed, like a red speck, in the air.","Another glowed steadily, green and foreboding, without rays; and at his feet, full of mist, the wide throat of the valley seemed itself like the bed of a stream, wherein black air-waves rolled noiselessly.",Deep melancholy fell on Ilya's heart.,"He looked down and thought, ""A moment ago I felt full of courage, light, and happy, and now it's all gone again.","Why does life drive a man on and on against his will, where he has no desire to go?","Everything in life is so oppressive and heavy, full of injustice, full of perplexity!","Perhaps Jakov is right--men must first of all understand themselves, how they live and by what laws?""","He remembered how strange, almost hostile, Jakov had been towards him to-day, and he grew more sorrowful as he remembered.","Suddenly there was a noise in the valley, a mass of earth had loosened and rolled down.",The damp night wind breathed on Ilya's face; he looked up to the sky.,"The stars burned shyly, and over the wood the great red ball of the moon heaved slowly up, like a huge, pitiless eye.","And like the bat through the twilight, dark images and memories fluttered through Ilya's soul.","They came and went without solving the riddles that oppressed him, and denser and heavier grew the darkness over his heart.","""Men rob and torment and strangle one another, and no one dreams of making life easier for his fellows, but each watches only for a chance to fight his way out and rest in a peaceful corner.","I, too, am seeking for such a corner, and where is the Truth and Reality and Steadfastness in this life?""","He sat a long time there, thinking, looking now at the sky, now at the valley.",All was still in the fields.,"The moonlight looking into the dark gully, showed its clefts and the bushes on its slopes, that threw vague shadows on the ground.","The sky was pure and clear, nothing showed but the moon and stars.","A cold shiver ran through Ilya, he got up and went slowly to the town, whose lights gleamed in the distance.",He had no further wish to think at all.,His breast was now filled with cold indifference.,"He reached home late, and stood thoughtfully before the door, hesitating to ring.",The windows were dark already.,Evidently his landlord had gone early to rest.,"He disliked to disturb Tatiana Vlassyevna so late, for she always saw to the door herself; but he had to get in.",He pulled the bell gently.,"The door opened almost immediately, and the slender form of Tatiana appeared, dressed in white.","""Shut the door quickly,"" she said, in a strange voice.","""It is cold; I've hardly anything on.","My husband's not at home.""","""I'm so sorry to be late,"" murmured Ilya.","""Yes, you are late.","Where have you been?""","Ilya closed the door and turned round to answer, and suddenly felt her close to him; she did not move, but nestled closer; he could not give way, the door was at his back.","Then suddenly she laughed--a soft, trembling laugh.",Lunev put his hands tenderly on her shoulders; he shook with excitement and longing to embrace her.,"Then all at once she straightened herself, laid her slender warm arms round his neck, and said in a ringing voice: ""Why do you wander abroad in the night?",Why?,"You can be happy nearer home--for a long time you might have been--my dearest, my beautiful, strong boy!""","As if in a dream, Ilya felt for her lips and swayed beneath the convulsive embrace of the slender body; she clung to his breast like a cat, and kissed him again and again.","He caught her in his strong arms and bore her away, carrying his burden as easily as though he trod on air.",In the morning Ilya woke with trouble in his heart.,"""How can I look Kirik in the face?""","he thought, and shame was added to the anxiety that the thought of the inspector aroused in him.","""If only I had quarrelled with him, or didn't like him.","But to injure him, and so deeply, without any cause----"" he thought with fear in his heart, and a feeling of disgust arose in him for Tatiana.","He felt that Kirik was certain to find out his wife's unfaithfulness, and he could not imagine what would happen.","""How she fell on me, as if she were starving!""","he thought, in restless, painful doubt; and yet felt, too, a pleasing sense of gratified vanity.","This was no ""tradesman's darling,"" as he used to call Olympiada in his thoughts, but a woman, respected by all the world--an educated, pretty married woman.","""There must be something special about me,"" his vanity whispered to him.","""It's too bad--too bad!","But I'm not made of stone, and I couldn't turn her away.""","He was young in fact, and his fancy was full of the woman's caresses.",Besides his practical mind saw involuntarily several advantages that might arise from this new relationship.,"But close on the heels of these ideas, like a dark cloud, came other gloomy thoughts.","""Now I'm in a corner again.",Did I want it?,I respected her!,"I never had an evil thought about her; and now it's happened like this.""","Then again, all the disturbance and contradiction in his soul was covered by the joyful thought that soon now his sheltered, clean life would begin.","But to the end the painful, stabbing thought persisted: ""It would have been better without this.""","He stayed in bed, pondering, till Avtonomov went to his duties.","He heard the inspector say to his wife, smacking his lips: ""Let me have meat pasties for dinner, Tanya.","Take a little more pork, and then just brown them a little, till they look like tiny little sucking pigs on the plate--you know; and just a little pepper with them, my dear, the way I like it.","Then I'll bring you some marmalade, shall I?""","""Now, go along!",go along!,"As if I didn't know what you like!""",said his wife tenderly.,"""And now, my darling, my little Tanya, give me one more kiss!""",Lunev shuddered.,It all seemed to him horrible and ridiculous.,"""Tchik!","tchik!""","cried Avtonomov as he kissed his wife, and she laughed.","As soon as she had shut the door behind him, she danced into Ilya's room, and cried: ""Kiss me quick--I've no time.""","""You've just kissed your husband,"" said Ilya moodily.","""Wha--at?",Eh?,Aha!,"He's jealous!""","she cried, delighted, then sprang up and drew the window curtain.","""Jealous!""",she said.,"""That's so nice!","Jealous men are always passionate lovers.""","""I didn't say it out of jealousy.""","""Don't talk!""","she commanded, and put her hand on his lips.","Then, when she had been kissed enough, she looked at Ilya, with a smile, and could not keep from saying: ""Well, you're a bold fellow--a downright daredevil--to carry on like this under the husband's nose.""","Her greenish eyes sparkled impudently, and she cried: ""Oh, it's quite a common thing, not in the least unusual!",Do you suppose there are many women true to their husbands?,"Only the ugly ones and the sick ones--a pretty woman always wants to enjoy herself and have a little romance.""","During the whole morning she instructed Ilya on this point, told him all sorts of stories of wives who were untrue to their husbands.","In her red blouse, with her skirts tucked up, and her sleeves rolled above her elbows, supple and light, she danced about the kitchen, preparing the pasties for her husband, and chattering all the time in her clear, ringing voice: ""A husband!--d'you think a wife must be always content with him?","The husband can sometimes be very disagreeable, even if you love him; and then he never thinks twice if he has a chance to be false to his wife.","So it's dull for a wife, too, to think of nothing all her life but--my husband, my husband, my husband.""","Ilya listened, as he drank his tea, which seemed to have a bitter taste.","In this woman's speech there was something defiant, unpleasantly provocative, that was new to him.","Involuntarily he remembered Olympiada, the deep voice, the quiet movements, and the glowing words that had power to grip his heart.","For the rest Olympiada was a woman of no great education, who might have been the wife of a small tradesman, but even because of that she was simpler in her shamelessness.","Ilya answered Tatiana's pleasantries with a slight laugh, and had to force himself even to laugh.","His heart was sick, and he only laughed because he did not know what to speak of.","Her words aroused a painful melancholy in him, and yet he listened with deep interest, and finally said thoughtfully: ""I did not believe that such things happened in your set?""","""Things, my dear, are the same everywhere.""","""You don't mind much, do you?","Why do you look so cross?""","Ilya stood in the doorway and looked fixedly at her, wrinkling his brow.","She went up to him, put her hands on his shoulders, and looked into his face curiously.","""I'm not cross,"" said Ilya seriously.","""Really?",Oh!,thank you--ha!,ha!,ha!,"how good you are!""",She laughed brightly.,"""I was only thinking,"" said Ilya, speaking slowly--""It's all quite right, what you say--but there's something bad in it too.""","""Oho!",What a touchy person you are!,"Something bad, eh?","What then--explain to me!""",But he could not.,He himself did not understand what it was in her words that displeased him.,"Olympiada had often spoken, more simply, more plainly; but her words had never given him the pain of soul that he felt from the chatter of this pretty little bird.","He pondered all day obstinately on the strange feeling of discomfort that had arisen in his heart through this new intimacy, so flattering to his vanity, and he could not arrive at the source of the sensation.","When he came home that night, Kirik met him in the kitchen, and said in a friendly way: ""I say, Ilya, Tanyusha did some cooking to-day--meat pasties--I tell you, it seemed almost a pity to eat them!",Almost as bad as eating living nightingales.,"I've left a plateful for you, brother.","Hang up your box, sit down, and see what you will see.""","Ilya looked at him conscience-stricken, and said with a forced laugh: ""Thank you, Kirik Nikodimovitch.""","Then he added, with a sigh: ""You're a good fellow, by Jove!""","""What,"" answered Kirik, ""a plate of pasty--that's nothing!","No, brother, if I were chief of police--then you might perhaps thank me, but I'm not.","I shall give up the police altogether, and start as agent or manager in a big business.","A manager, that's something like a good position; if I get it I'll soon get a little capital together.""",Tatiana was busy at the stove and singing softly.,"Ilya looked at her, and again felt a painful discomfort; but almost immediately the sensation vanished under the influence of new impressions and cares.","During these days he had no time to give to brooding; the arrangement of the shop and the purchase of goods occupied him entirely, and from day to day amidst his work he grew accustomed to this woman, almost without knowing, like a drunkard to the taste of brandy.","She pleased him more and more as a mistress, although her caresses often caused him shame, even anxiety; her caresses and her talk together slowly destroyed his respect for her as a woman.","Every morning after she had seen her husband off to work, or in the evenings when he was on duty, she called Ilya to her or came into his room, and told him all sorts of stories ""of real life;"" and all her stories were curiously vicious, as though they related to a country inhabited only by liars and scoundrels of both sexes, whose greatest pleasure lay in adultery.","""Is that all true?""",asked Ilya gloomily.,"He didn't want to believe, but felt helpless and unable to contradict.","He listened, and life seemed to him like a swill-tub, and men moving in it like worms.","""Ugh!""","he said wearily, ""is there nothing clean or true anywhere?""","""What d'you call true?","What d'you mean?""",asked Tatiana in surprise.,"""Why, something honourable!""",cried Lunev angrily.,"""Why, it's honourable people I'm speaking of--how funny you are!","I don't make it all up.""","""That's not what I mean.","Is there anywhere anything honourable--pure, or not?""",She did not understand and laughed at him.,"Sometimes her conversation took a different tone; looking at him with greenish eyes, darting an uncanny fire, she asked him: ""Tell me, what was your first experience of women?""","Ilya was ashamed of the memory, it was hateful to him.","He turned away from the glance of his mistress, and said in a low reproachful voice: ""What horrid things you ask!","I think you ought to be ashamed--men don't even speak like that with one another.""","But she laughed happily, and went on talking till Lunev often felt defiled with her words as with pitch.","But if she read in his face any hostile feeling, or perceived in his eyes any weariness, or distress, or sorrow, she knew how to kindle his desire afresh and banish by her caresses all feelings hostile to her influence.","One day when Ilya returned from the shop, where already the joiners were putting in the shelves, he saw to his astonishment, Matiza in the kitchen.","She was sitting at the table, her big hands folded in her lap, and conversing with the mistress of the house, who was standing by the hearth.","""Here,"" said Tatiana, and nodded at Matiza, ""this lady has been waiting for you, for ever so long.""","""Good evening!""","said Matiza, and got up clumsily.","""Why,"" cried Ilya, ""are you still living?""","""Even pigs don't eat dirty bits of wood,"" answered Matiza in her deep voice.","Ilya had not seen her for a long time, and looked at her now with mingled feelings of compassion and pleasure.","She was dressed in ragged fustian, an old faded kerchief covered her head, her feet were bare.","She moved with difficulty, but supporting herself with her hands on the wall, she crept slowly into Ilya's room, sat heavily in a chair, and spoke in a hoarse toneless voice: ""I shall soon die.","You see, I can hardly move my feet, and when I can't walk, I can't find food, and then I must die.""",Her face was horribly bloated and covered with dark flecks.,The big eyes were hardly visible between the swollen lids.,"""What are you looking at?""",she said to Ilya.,"""You think some one has struck me?","No, it is a disease, devouring me.""","""What are you doing?""","""I sit by the church door and beg for coppers,"" said Matiza, indifferently, in her deep, resonant voice.","""I'm come on business.","I heard from Perfishka that you were living here, and so I came.""","""May I give you some tea?""",asked Lunev.,"It hurt him to hear Matiza's voice and see her big, slack body perishing visibly.","""The devil wash his tail in your tea!","Give me five kopecks, do!","I came to you--well, you can ask me why.""",Speech was difficult.,"She breathed short, and an overpowering odour came from her.","""Well, why?""","asked Ilya, turning away and remembering how he had insulted her once.","""Do you remember Mashutka?",What?,You've a poor memory!,"You've grown rich!""","""I remember, of course I remember,"" said Ilya quickly.","""What's the good of your remembering?""",she interrupted.,"""Has that made her life any easier?""","""What's the matter with her?","How is she getting on?""","Matiza's head swayed, and she said briefly: ""She hasn't hanged herself yet.""","""Oh, speak out!""",cried Ilya roughly.,"""What do you begin at me for?","You sold her yourself for three roubles.""","""I don't reproach you, only myself,"" she answered quietly and emphatically, then began to tell of Masha, choking with the exertion.","""Her old husband is jealous and torments her, he lets her go nowhere, not even into the shop.","She sits in one room, and mayn't go into the courtyard without leave.","He's got rid of his children somehow, and lives alone with Masha.","He pinches her and ties her hands, he treats her so badly because his first wife was untrue, and the two children are not his.","Masha has run away twice, but both times the police have brought her back, and the old man pinches her and starves her for it.","See, what a life!""","""Yes, you and Perfishka did a good deed,"" said Ilya gloomily.","""I thought it was better,"" said the woman, in her toneless voice.","Her face motionless as though carved in stone, and her dead voice, weighed on Ilya.","""I thought--it was cleaner so.",But the worse would have been better.,"She might have been sold to a rich man, he would have given her a home and clothes, and everything, and afterwards she would have sent him off and lived like all the others.","Ever so many live like that.""","""Well, why have you come to me?""",asked Ilya.,"""You live here, in a policeman's house.","You see, they always catch her.","Tell him to let her go, let her run away.",She'll manage somehow.,"Is one not allowed to run away?""","""You really came for that?""","""Yes, why not?","They ought not to stop her, tell them!""","""Ah, you people!""","cried Ilya, trying to think what he could do for Masha.","Matiza rose from her chair, and shuffled carefully over the floor.","She sighed and groaned, and she was not like a human being walking, but like an old, decayed tree falling slowly down.","""Good-bye!",We shan't meet again!,"I shall soon die,"" she murmured.","""Thank you, thank you, my fine, trim fellow!","Thank you!""","As soon as she was gone, Tatiana hurried into Ilya's room, embraced him, and asked smiling: ""That's the one--your first love, eh?""","""Who?""","asked Ilya slowly, absorbed in memories of Masha.","""That horror----"" Ilya unclasped her hands from his neck, and said moodily: ""She can hardly drag one foot after the other, but she cares for those she loves.""","""Whom does she love?""","asked the woman, and looked with wonder and curiosity at Ilya's anxious face.","""Wait, Tatiana, wait!","Don't make fun of her.""","He told her briefly of Masha, and asked: ""What is to be done?""","""Here, nothing,"" answered Tatiana, shrugging her shoulders.","""By the law, the wife belongs to her husband, and no one has any right to take her from him.""","And, with the important air of one who knows the law well and is convinced of its stability, she explained at length that Masha must obey her husband.","""She must just hang on for the present.",Let her wait--he's old; he'll soon die.,"Then she'll be free, and all his money will go to her.","And then you'll marry the rich young widow, eh?""",She laughed and continued to instruct Ilya seriously.,"""It would be best for you to give up your old acquaintances.","They're no use to you now, and they might get in your way.","They're all so coarse and dirty--that one, for instance, you lent money to--such a skinny fellow, with wicked eyes.""","""Gratschev?""","""Yes.","What funny names common people have--Gratschev, Lunev, Petuchev, Skvarzov.--In our set the names are much better, prettier--Avtonomov, Korsakov--my father's name was Florianov.","When I was a young girl I was courted by a lawyer, Gloriantov.","Once at the skating, he stole my garter, and threatened to make a scandal if I did not go to his house to get it back----"" Ilya listened, remembering his own past.","He felt his soul bound by invisible threads fast to the house of Petrusha Filimonov, and it seemed this house would always hold him back from the peaceful life he longed for.",XX.,At last Ilya Lunev's dream was realised.,"Full of calm joy, he stood from morning to night behind the counter of his own business, and swelled with pride over all he saw round him.","Boxes of wood and cardboard were ranged carefully on the shelves; in the window was a display of waist-buckles, purses, soap, buttons, with gay-coloured ribbons and laces.","It was all bright and clean, and shone in the sunshine in rainbow colours.","Handsome and steady-looking, he received his customers with a polite bow and displayed his goods on the counter before them.","He heard pleasant music in the rustling of his laces and ribbons, and all the girls--tailoresses, who bought a few kopecks' worth--seemed to him pretty and lovable.","All at once life became pleasant and easy, a clear, simple meaning seemed to have entered into it, and the past was veiled in a cloud.","No thoughts came to him save of business, and goods and customers.","He had taken on an errand boy, dressed him in a well-fitting grey jacket, and took great care that the lad washed himself well, and kept as clean as possible.","""You and I, Gavrik,"" he said, ""deal in fine goods, and we must be clean.""","Gavrik was a lad of twelve years, rather fat, snub-nosed and slightly pock-marked, with little grey eyes and a lively face.","He had passed through the town school, and considered himself a full-grown, serious man.","He took a great interest in his work in the clean little shop; it delighted him to handle the boxes, and he was at great pains to be as polite to the customers as his master.","But this he found difficult--his talents for mimicry were too strongly developed, and he was apt to reproduce on his coarse face any expression that he observed in a customer.","Above all he was the sworn foe of all little girls, and could seldom resist the temptation to pinch them or push them, or pull their hair, and generally make their lives a burden.","Ilya watched him, and remembered how he had served in the fish shop, and as he had a liking for the boy, he joked with him and spoke to him in a friendly way when there were no customers in the shop.","""If you're dull, Gavrik, read books when there's no work to be done,"" he advised.","""Time passes easily with a book, and reading's pleasant.""","From this time Lunev began to regard mankind cheerfully and attentively, and he smiled as much as to say: ""I'm a lucky one, you see; but patience!","Your turn will come soon.""",He opened his shop at seven and closed at ten.,"There were few customers; he sat on a chair near the door basking in the rays of the spring sun, and resting, almost without a thought, without a wish.","Gavrik sat in the doorway, observed the passers-by, imitated their ways, enticed the dogs to him, and threw stones at the pigeons and sparrows, or else read a book, and breathed heavily through his nose.","Sometimes his master would make him read aloud, but the actual reading did not interest Ilya, he listened rather to the stillness and peace in his heart.","This inner peace filled him with delight, it was new to him and unspeakably pleasant.","Now and then, however, the sweetness was disturbed, there was a strange, incomprehensible sensation, a premonition of unrest; it could not shatter the peace in his soul, but rested lightly on it like a shadow.",Then Ilya began to talk to the boy.,"""Gavrik!","What is your father?""","""He's a postman.""","""Are you a big family?""","""Big?",There's a crowd of us.,"Some grown-up, but some are still little.""","""How many little ones?""","""Five, and three grown-up.",We three have all got places.,"I'm with you, Vassili is in Siberia in a telegraph office, Sonyka gives lessons.","She earns a lot, twelve roubles a month.","Then there's Mishka--he is older than I am, but he's still at school.""","""Then there are four grown-up, not three?""","""No, how?""","cried Gavrik, and added sententiously: ""Mishka is still learning, but a grown-up is one who works.""","""Do you have a hard time at home?""","""Rather,"" answered Gavrik indifferently, and sniffed loudly.",Then he began to explain his schemes for the future.,"""When I'm big, I shall be a soldier.","Then there'll be a war, and I'll go to the war.","I'm brave, and so I'll rush at the enemy before all the others and capture the standard--that's what my uncle did--and General Gourko gave Kim a medal and five roubles.""","Ilya listened, smiling, and looked at the pock-marked face, and the wide, twitching nostrils.","In the evening when the shop was shut, Ilya went into the little room at the back.","The samovar made ready by the lad was on the table, and bread and sausage.","Gavrik had his tea and bread and went into the shop to sleep, but Ilya sat long by the samovar, often as much as two hours.","Two chairs, a table, a bed, and a cupboard for household utensils made up all the furniture of Ilya's new home.","The room was small and low, with a square window from which could be seen the feet of the passers-by, the roofs of the houses over the way, and the sky above the roofs.",He hung a white muslin curtain before the window.,"An iron railing cut the window off from the street, and this displeased Ilya very much.","Over his bed was a picture--""The Steps of Man's Life.""","This picture was a great favourite with Ilya, and he had long wished to buy it, but for one reason and another he had never possessed it till he opened his shop, though it cost but ten kopecks.","The steps of man's life were arranged in the form of an arch, under which was represented Paradise; here the Almighty, surrounded with rays of light and flowers, talked with Adam and Eve.",There were seventeen steps in all.,"On the first stood a child supported by his mother, and underneath, in red letters: ""The first step.""","On the second the child was beating a drum, and the inscription ran: ""Five years old--he plays.""","At seven years of age he began ""to learn;"" at ten, ""goes to school;"" at twenty-one he stood on the step with a rifle in his hand, and a smiling face, and underneath was written: ""Serves his time as a soldier.""","On the next step he is twenty-five, he is in evening dress, with an opera hat in one hand and a bouquet in the other--""he is a bridegroom.""","Then his beard is grown, he has a long coat and a red tie, and is standing near a stout lady in yellow, and pressing her hand.",Next he is thirty-five; he stands with rolled-up shirt-sleeves by an anvil and hammers the iron.,"At the top of the arch he is sitting in a red chair reading the paper, his wife and four children are listening to him.","He himself and all his family are well dressed, respectable, with healthy, happy faces.",At this time he is fifty years old.,"But note how the steps begin to go down; the man's beard is already grey, he is clad in a long yellow coat, and in his hands he holds a bag of fish and a jar of some sort.","This step is labelled: ""Household duties.""","On the following step the man is rocking the cradle of his grandson; lower down ""he is led,"" being now eighty years old; and in the last--he is ninety-five--he is in a chair with his feet in a coffin, and behind the chair stands Death, with the scythe in his hand.","When Ilya sat by the samovar he looked at the picture, and it pleased him to see the life of man so accurately and simply depicted.","The picture radiated peace, the bright colours seemed to smile at him, and he was persuaded that the series represented honourable life wisely and intelligibly, as an example to men--life exactly as it should be led.","As he gazed at this representation of life, he thought that now that he had attained his desire, his career must henceforth follow the picture exactly.","He would mount upwards, and right at the summit, when he had saved enough money, he would marry a modest girl who had learned to read and to write.",The samovar hummed and whistled in a melancholy way.,"The sky looked dull through the glass of the window and the muslin curtain, and the stars were hardly visible.",There is always something disturbing in the glance of the stars.,"""Perhaps it would be better to marry at forty,"" thought Ilya.","""Life is so disturbed with women; they bring such useless hurrying and so many petty things: and it is better to marry a girl who is close on thirty.","But then, if you marry late, you die and never have time to start your children for themselves.""",The samovar whistles more gently but more shrilly.,"The fine sound pierces the ears unbearably; it is like the buzzing of a fly, and distracts and confuses thought.","But Ilya does not put the lid on the chimney, for if the samovar ceases to whistle, the room becomes so still.","In his new house, new feelings, hitherto unknown, come to visit him.","Formerly he had lived constantly close to people, separated from them only by thin partitions; now he was shut off by stone walls and felt no man at his back.","""Why must we die?""","Lunev asks himself suddenly, looking at the man declining from the height of his fortune towards the grave.","Then he remembers Jakov, who was always pondering on death, and Jakov's saying: ""It is interesting to die.""","Angrily Ilya thrusts the memory away, and tries to think of something quite different.","""How are Pavel and Vyera getting on?""",he wonders suddenly.,"A droshky drives by; the window-panes shake with the noise of the wheels on the stony street, the lamp trembles on the wall.",Then strange sounds arise in the shop--it is Gavrik talking in his sleep.,The dense darkness in the corner of the room seems to move.,"Ilya sits propped up at the table, presses his temples with the palms of his hands, and looks at the picture.","Next to the Almighty is a fine big lion, on the ground crawls a tortoise, and there is a badger and a frog jumping, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is adorned with great blood-red flowers.","The old man with his feet in the coffin is like Poluektov, he is bald-headed and lean, and his neck is of just the same thin kind.",A dull noise of footsteps sounds from the street.,Some one goes slowly past the shop.,"The samovar has gone out, and now the room is so still that the air in it seems thickened and as solid as the walls.","The memory of Poluektov did not trouble Ilya and, generally speaking, his thoughts were not disturbing--they lay soft and easily on his soul, enwrapping it as a cloud the moon.","The colours of the picture were made a little pale by them, and a vague dark spot appeared on it, while the stillness round about grew denser.","Frequently he thought with calmness, as he had done after the murder of Poluektov, that there must be justice in life, and that, sooner or later, men must be punished for their sins.","After such thoughts, he would look sharply into the dark corner of the room, where it was so mysteriously still, and where the darkness would take on a definite form.","Then he undressed, lay down, and extinguished the lamp.","He did not put it out at once, but turned the wick first up, then down.","The light would all but go out, then again flare up, and the darkness danced round the bed, now threw itself on the bed from all sides, now again sprung back into the corner of the room.","Ilya watched how the pitiless black waves tried to overwhelm him, and he played in this way for a long time, whilst trying to pierce the darkness with wide-open eyes, as though he expected to catch sight of something.","At last the light flickered for the last time, and went out in a moment.","The blackness flooded the room, and seemed to waver as though still disturbed by its struggle with the light.",Then the dull bluish patch of the window became visible.,"When the moon shone, black streaks of shadow from the railings in front of the window fell across the table and the floor.",There was so tense a stillness in the room that it seemed as if his whole frame must quiver if he sighed.,"He wrapped the bed-clothes round him, drawing them up to his chin, but with his face uncovered, and lay and looked at the twilight of the window till sleep overpowered him.","In the morning he woke fresh and rested, almost ashamed of his follies of the night before.",He had tea with Gavrik at the counter and looked at his shop as at a new thing.,"Sometimes Pavel came in from his work, covered with dirt and grease, in a scorched blouse and with smoke-blackened face.","He was working again with a well-sinker, and carried with him a little kettle, with lead piping and soldering-iron.","He was always in a hurry to get home, and if Ilya asked him to stay, he would say, with a shame-faced smile: ""I can't.","I feel, brother, as though I had a wonderful bird at home, but as if the cage were too weak.","She sits there alone all day, and who knows what she thinks about?",It's a dull kind of life for her.,"I know that very well--if only we had a child!""",And Gratschev sighed heavily.,"Once when Ilya asked him if he still wrote poems, he replied smiling: ""On the sky, with my finger!","Oh, the devil!",How can you make cabbage soup of bast shoes.,"I'm on the sand-bank, brother, altogether.","Not a spark in my head, not one little one!",I think of her all the time.,"I work, begin to solder or something, and at once dreams of my little girl fly through my head.",You see that's my poetry nowadays--ha!,ha!,"Surely, honour to him who devotes himself body and soul!--You see, though I think this, she thinks differently--yes, it's hard for her.""","""And you?""",asked Ilya.,"""Oh, yes; it's hard for me because of her.",If she could have a happier life!,"She's used to being happy, that's it.",She dreams of money all the time.,"If we had money, anyhow, she says everything would be different.",I'm stupid she says; I ought to rob a rich man; she's always talking nonsense.,She does it all out of compassion for me--I know.,"It is hard for her.""",Presently Pavel became restless and departed.,"Often the ragged half-naked cobbler came to Ilya with his inseparable companion, his harmonica, under his arm.",He told what had happened at Filimonov's and of Jakov.,"Thin and dirty and dishevelled, he pushed into the door of the shop; smiling all over his face, and scattering his jests.","""Petrusha is married, his wife is like--like a beetroot, and the stepson like a carrot.","Quite a vegetable garden, by God!","The wife is thick and short and red, and her face is built in three storeys; three chins she has, but only one mouth; eyes like a beautiful pig, they are little and can't look up.","Her son is yellow and long, with spectacles--an aristocrat.",He's called Savva--speaks through his nose.,"When his lady-mother's there he's an absolute sheep, but if she's away, chatterbox isn't the word!",Such a crew--with all due respect!,Jashutka looks now as if he'd like to crawl into a crack like a terrified black beetle.,"He drinks on the quiet, poor lad, and coughs away like anything.",Evidently his dear papa has damaged his liver for him; they're always at him.,He's a feeble fellow; they'll soon swallow him down.,Your uncle has written from Kiev; I think he is worrying himself for nothing.,"Hunchbacks don't get in to Paradise, I'm thinking.",Matiza's feet are no good at all now.,She goes about in a little cart.,"She's got a blind man for partner, harnesses him to the cart, and guides him like a horse--it's really funny.",They get enough to eat out of it though.,"She's a good sort, I say.",That's to say if I hadn't had such a wonderful wife I'd marry this Matiza right away.,"I say boldly, there are two real women in the world--on my word I mean it--my wife and Matiza.","Of course she drinks, but why not?","A good man always drinks.""","""But what about Mashutka?""",Ilya reminded him.,"At the mention of his daughter all the cobbler's jests and laughter came to a sudden end, like the leaves torn from the trees by the winds of autumn.","His lips quivered, his yellow face lengthened, and he said in a confused low voice: ""I don't know.","Ehrenov said to me plainly I won't have you about my house, else I'll thrash you.--Give me something, Ilya Jakovlevitch, for a little drink of brandy.""","""You'll come to grief, Perfily,"" said Ilya compassionately.","""I'm on the way,"" admitted the cobbler.","""Lots of people will be sorry when I'm dead,"" he went on with conviction.","""For I'm a good fellow, and I like to make people laugh.",Every one cries--ah!,and alas!,and laments and talks of God and sin; but I sing little songs and laugh.,"Whether you sin a pennyworth or a pound's-worth, you've got to die all the same.","You go under, and the Devil will torment you anyhow; and besides the world needs good fellows.""","Finally he went off, laughing and jesting, like a tousled old greenfinch.","But Ilya, when he had seen him out, shook his head; while he pitied Perfishka, he saw the uselessness of his compassion.","His own past seemed far behind him, and all that reminded him of it made him uncomfortable.","Now he resembled a weary man who rests and sleeps quietly, but the autumn flies buzz persistently in his ear and will not let him have his sleep out.","When he talked to Pavel or listened to Perfishka's tales, he smiled in sympathy, but when they were gone, he shook his head.",Especially he found Pavel's conversation melancholy and troubling.,"At such times he hurriedly and obstinately offered him money, gesticulated, and said: ""What else can I do to help you?","I should advise you--break with Vyera!""","""I can't,"" said Pavel, softly.","""You only throw away things you don't want.","But I need her--ah, yes, and others want her too, and would like to take her from me, that's the trouble.","And perhaps I don't love her with my soul, but out of wickedness and desperation.",She's the best that life has offered me.,All my good fortune.,Why should I let her go?,What shall I have left?,"No, I won't sell her.","It's a lie.--I'll kill her, but I won't let her go.""","Gratschev's drawn face was covered with red patches, and he clenched his fists convulsively.","""Do you find, then, that people hang about after her?""","""No, no!""","""How do you mean, then--they'd like to take her away?""","""There's a power that will snatch her from my hands.",Ah!,the devil!,"My father came to grief through a woman, and seems to have left me the same fortune.""","""It's impossible to help you, I'm afraid,"" said Lunev, and felt a certain relief as he said it.","Pavel distressed him more than Perfishka, and when his friend spoke with hate and anger, a similar feeling surged up in Ilya's breast against some undefined person.","But the enemy that caused the suffering, that ruined Pavel's life, was not there, but invisible, and Lunev felt anew that his enmity or his compassion availed nothing, like nearly all his sympathetic feelings towards other men.","It seemed these feelings were all superfluous, useless.","Pavel went on, more gloomily: ""I know--it's impossible to help me.--How could I be helped?",Who is there?,"We're alone in life, brother; our lot is settled--work, suffer, be silent--and then go out.","Devil take you!""","He looked searchingly into his friend's face, and added in a decided, sinister tone: ""Look!",You've crawled into a corner and sit quiet there.,"But I tell you, there's some one, who watches by night, thinking how to drag you out.""","""No, no!""",said Lunev smiling.,"""I'll make a fight for it.","It's not so easy.""","""Ah, don't be so sure!","You think you'll run this business all your life, eh?""","""Why not?""","""They'll have you out, or else you yourself will give it up.""","""But how?","You'll have to wait to see that!""","said Ilya, smiling.",But Gratschev maintained his statement.,"He looked hard at his friend, and said obstinately: ""I tell you, you'll leave it.","You are not the kind to sit quiet and warm all your life, and it's certain either you'll take to drink or you'll go bankrupt.","Something's bound to happen to you.""","""Yes, but why?""","cried Lunev, in surprise.","""For this--You can't stand a quiet life.","You're a good fellow, you've a good heart, there are a few like that--they live healthy lives, are never ill, and all of a sudden--bang!""","""What d'you mean?""","""They fall down dead.""","Ilya laughed, straightened himself, stretched his strong muscles, and breathed out a deep breath.","""That's all rubbish,"" he said.","But at night, as he sat by the samovar, Gratschev's words returned involuntarily, and he considered his business relations with the Avtonomovs.","In his delight at their proposal to open a shop, he had agreed to everything that was suggested.","Now, suddenly he perceived that, although he had put into the business about four hundred roubles of Poluektov's money, he was rather a manager, engaged by Tatiana Vlassyevna, than her partner.",This discovery surprised and annoyed him.,"""Aha!","that's why she kisses me, so as to pick my pocket more easily,"" he thought.",He determined to use the rest of his money to get the business away from his mistress and then separate from her.,"Even earlier, Tatiana Vlassyevna had seemed to him unnecessary, and of late she had become a burden.","He could not reconcile himself to her caresses, and once said to her face: ""You're absolutely shameless, Tanyka!""",She only laughed.,"As before, she constantly told him tales of the people of her circle, and once he remarked, doubtfully: ""If that's all true, Tatiana, your respectable life isn't good for much.""","""Why, pray?","It's very jolly!""","she replied, and shrugged her pretty shoulders.","""Jolly?","In the day, a fight for crumbs, and at night--beastliness.",No!,"There's something wrong about that.""","""How simple you are!","Now listen,"" and she began to praise the orderly, respectable middle-class life, and as she praised, strove to hide its hideousness and foulness.","""Is that what you call good, then?""",asked Ilya.,"""How odd you are!","I don't call it good; but if it weren't it would be very dull.""","Sometimes she would advise him: ""It's time you gave up wearing cotton shirts--a respectable man must wear linen.","And listen to the way I pronounce words, and learn.","You're not a peasant any longer, and you must drop your peasant ways, and get a little polish.""","More often she would point out the difference between him, the peasant, and herself, the educated woman, and by the comparison frequently hurt his feelings.","When he lived with Olympiada, he felt constantly that she was near him, like a good comrade.","Tatiana aroused no feeling of comradeship; he saw that she was more interesting than Olympiada, and studied her with curiosity, but completely lost his respect for her.","When he lived with the Avtonomovs, he used sometimes to hear Tatiana praying before she went to sleep: ""Our Father, Who art in heaven""--her loud rapid whisper sounded behind the partition.","""Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses--Kirya, get up and shut the kitchen door--there's a draught at my feet.""","""Why do you kneel on the bare floor?""",answered Kirik lazily.,"""Be quiet, don't interrupt me!""",and again Ilya would hear the rapidly murmured prayer.,"The haste displeased him; he saw well she prayed from custom, not from inner need.","""Do you believe in God, Tatiana?""",he asked her once.,"""What a question,"" she cried.","""Of course I do.","Why do you ask?""","""Oh, then when you pray, you hurry up so as to get away from Him, I suppose,"" said Ilya laughing.","""First of all, don't say hurry up, but make haste; in the second place, I'm so tired with my day's work that God must forgive my haste.""","And she closed her eyes, and added in a tone of deep conviction: ""He will forgive everything.","He is merciful.""",Olympiada used to pray silently and for a long time.,"She knelt before the eikon, hung her head, and remained motionless as if turned to stone.","At such times her face was downcast, serious; and she did not answer if addressed.","Now that Ilya grasped that Tatiana had cleverly over-reached him over the business, he felt a kind of disgust towards her.","""If she were a stranger--well and good,"" he thought.","""All men try to cheat one another, but she is almost like my wife.""","He began to behave coldly and suspiciously towards her, and to avoid meeting her on all sorts of pretexts.",Just at this time he became acquainted with another woman.,"This was Gavrik's sister, who came now and then to see her brother.","Tall, thin, and lanky, she was not pretty, and though Gavrik had said she was nineteen she seemed to Ilya much older.",Her face was long and thin and yellow; fine wrinkles furrowed the brow.,"She had a flat nose, and the wide nostrils seemed distended with anger, while the thin lips were usually pressed together.","She spoke distinctly, but as it were through her teeth, and unwillingly.","She walked quickly with her head high, as though she were proud to display her ugly face, though possibly it was her long, thick black hair that drew her head backwards.","Her big dark eyes looked serious and earnest, and the whole effect of her features was to give her tall figure an air of definite uprightness and inflexibility.",Lunev felt afraid of her.,She seemed to him proud and inspired him with respect.,"Whenever she appeared in the shop, he offered her a chair politely and said: ""Please take a seat.""","""Thank you,"" she said shortly--bowed slightly and sat down.","Lunev looked secretly at her face, absolutely different from the women's faces he had seen hitherto, her dark-brown well-worn dress, her patched shoes and yellow straw hat.","She sat there, and talked to her brother, while the long fingers of her right hand drummed rapidly but noiselessly on her knee; in her left hand she swung some books, strapped together.","It struck Ilya as strange to see a girl so badly dressed, so proud.","After sitting two or three minutes she would say to her brother: ""Well--good-bye.","Behave yourself!""",Then she would bow silently to the owner of the shop and go out into the street with the stride of a brave soldier going to the attack.,"""What a serious sister you've got,"" said Lunev once to Gavrik.","Gavrik distended his nostrils, rolled his eyes wildly, and drew out his lips into a straight line, and so gave his face a carefully caricatured resemblance to his sister's.","Then he explained with a smile: ""Yes--but she only puts it on.""","""But why should she?""","""It looks well.","She likes it.--I can imitate any face you like.""",The girl interested Ilya very much; he thought about her as he used to think of Tatiana Vlassyevna.,"""There, that's the kind of girl to marry--she's got a heart, for certain.""","Once she brought a thick book with her and said to her brother: ""There--read it!","It's very interesting.""","""What is it, may I see?""",asked Ilya politely.,"She took the book from her brother and passed it to Ilya saying: ""Don Quixote--the story of a worthy knight.""","""Ah!","I've read a lot about knights,"" said Ilya with a friendly smile, and looked her in the face.","Her eyebrows twitched, and she said quickly in a dry way: ""You've read fairy tales, but this is a fine clever book.",The man in it devotes himself to help the unfortunate and unjustly oppressed--this man was always ready to give his life for others.,You see?,The book is written amusingly--but that's because of the conditions under which it was written.,"It must be read seriously and attentively.""","""Then that's how we'll read it,"" said Ilya.","This was the first time she had spoken to him; he felt curiously pleased, and smiled.","But she looked in his face, said drily: ""I fancy you won't like it.""",Then she went away.,Ilya felt that she had spoken with intention and was annoyed.,He spoke sharply to Gavrik who was looking at the pictures in the book.,"""Now then--it's no time for reading now.""","""But there are no customers,"" answered Gavrik without closing the book.","Ilya looked at him and said nothing; the girl's words rang in his ears, but he thought of her with a feeling of discomfort in his heart.","""My word; doesn't she think a lot of herself!""",XXI.,Time passed on.,"Ilya stood behind the counter, twisted his moustache, and conducted his business, but it began to seem to him that the days went more slowly.","Sometimes he felt a desire to close the shop and go for a walk, but he knew that such a proceeding would be bad for his business and he did not go.","To walk in the evenings was inconvenient; Gavrik was afraid to be alone in the shop and there was a certain risk in leaving him, he might set the place on fire by accident or let in some rascal or other.",Business went fairly well.,Ilya thought it might be necessary to take an assistant.,"His intimacy with Tatiana had insensibly grown less, and she seemed willing that it should come to an end.","She laughed cheerfully when she came, and looked very carefully through the book that recorded the day's business.","While she sat and made calculations in Ilya's room, he felt that this woman with the bird's face was repugnant to him; but still from time to time she would be pert and gay, jesting and making eyes at him, and calling him her partner.",Then he would rouse himself and re-enter what in his heart he called a horrible web.,"Sometimes Kirik came too, stretched himself out in a chair by the counter and cracked jokes with the tailoresses who came in to make purchases while he was there.","He had discarded his police uniform, and boasted of his success in his new commercial employment.","""Sixty roubles salary and then in different ways I make as much again extra--not so bad, eh?","I work very carefully for the extras, keep within the law--ho!",ho!,"We've moved, did you hear?",We've a jolly house now.,"We've taken on a cook--cooks splendidly, the wretch!","When the autumn comes we'll ask lots of our friends and play cards; it's very pleasant, by Jove!","To have a good time and make money at it; we play into one another's hands, I and my wife, one of us must always win, and the winnings pay the cost of entertainment, ho!",ho!,my boy!,"There, that's living cheaply and pleasantly!""","He settled himself in a chair, puffed out the smoke of his cigarette and went on, lowering his voice: ""A little while ago, brother, I was in a village--have you heard?","I tell you, the girls there--d'you know, such children of Nature, so solid you know, you can't pinch them, the rascals,--and so cheap, too; a bottle of Schnapps, a pound of honey cakes, and she is yours!""","Lunev listened, but said nothing.","For some reason or other he was sorry for Kirik, and pitied him without realising why this fat and stupid fellow should rouse such a feeling.",At the same time he almost always wanted to laugh at the sight of him.,"Ilya did not believe Kirik's tales of his adventures in the village, but thought he was only boasting, talking as he had heard others talk.","But when he was in a gloomy mood, then he listened to Kirik and thought: ""Fighting for crumbs!""","""Yes, brother, it's splendid to make love in the bosom of Nature, in the shade of the leaves as they say in books.""","""But if Tatiana Vlassyevna knew?""","""She won't know, brother,"" answered Kirik, and winked cheerfully.","But when Avtonomov departed Ilya thought of his words, and felt hurt.","It was evident that Kirik, good-tempered and ridiculous though he were, yet held himself to be a man out of the common, whom Ilya could not hope to equal, higher in station and more important.",Yet he profited by the business Ilya carried on with his wife.,Perfishka had told them that Petrusha laughed at his shop and called him a rascal.,"Jakov had said to the cobbler that formerly Ilya was better and more friendly than now and did not think so much of himself, and Gavrik's sister constantly demonstrated that she thought herself superior to him.","The daughter of a postman, who went about almost in rags, behaved as though it were too much for her to live on the same world as he did.","Ilya's ambition had grown since he had opened his shop, and he was more sensitive than before.","His interest deepened in this girl who was so ugly, but had so strong a personality; he sought to understand whence came this pride in a poor ragged girl, a pride which grew to annoy him more and more.","At first she would not talk to him, and that pained him.","Her brother was his servant, and therefore she ought to be more friendly with him, the employer.","He said to her once: ""I'm reading the book of 'Don Quixote.'""","""Well, do you like it?""","she asked, without looking at him.","""Rather, most amusing,--he was a funny old owl that fellow!""","She looked at him, and Ilya felt as though her proud dark eyes pierced his face angrily.","""I knew you would say something like that,"" she said, slowly and with meaning.","Ilya was conscious of something reproachful, contemptuous and hostile in her words.","""I'm an uneducated man,"" he said, and shrugged his shoulders.",She said nothing as though she had not heard him.,"Once again the mood that long ago had possessed Ilya, began to invade his soul again; once more he was angered at mankind, pondered long and deeply upon justice, and his sins, and what might be in store for him in the future.",The last question troubled him persistently.,"He liked his shop, he liked almost all his life at this time; in comparison with the life of his younger days it was cleaner, more peaceful, freer.","But would it always be like this; to squat in his shop from morning to night, then sit awhile with his thoughts by the samovar, and then go to sleep, only to wake and begin again in the shop?","He knew that many tradesmen, perhaps all, lived just such a life.","But then they were married, and had children, they drank brandy, played cards, and among them all there was hardly one like himself.","He had many reasons, outward as well as inward, to consider himself an unusual man, unlike the rest.","He did not care for tradesmen; some of them were like Kirik, boasted of everything and spoke of nothing but their business, others swindled openly.","Once, as he meditated on all these things, he remembered Jakov's words: ""God guard you from good fortune--you are greedy,"" and the words appeared to him a deep insult.","No, he was not covetous; he wanted to live simply, cleanly, and quietly, to have men respect him and to have no one say: ""I stand higher than you, Ilya Lunev, I am better than you.""",Again he began to wonder what the future held in store for him.,Would the murder be avenged on him or not?,"Up and down, he thought, whether it would be unjust for the sin to be avenged on him.","He had had no desire to strangle the man, it happened of itself, he said to himself a hundred times.","In the town there live many murderers, libertines, robbers, all know they are murderers and robbers and libertines of their own choice, yet all live, and enjoy the good things of life, and no punishment is swift to fall upon them.","In justice, every injury done to man must be avenged on the evildoer, and in the Bible it is written: ""He rewardeth him and he shall know it.""",These thoughts set all his old wounds throbbing and a raging thirst burned in his heart to revenge his blighted life.,"Sometimes the idea came to him to do some daring deed; to go and set fire to Petrusha's house, and when it began to burn, and people began to run from it, to cry out: ""I have done it, and I have murdered Poluektov, the merchant.""","Then men would seize him and judge him, and send him to Siberia as they had sent his father.","This thought roused him and narrowed his thirst for revenge to the desire to tell Kirik of his intimacy with Tatiana, or to visit old Ehrenov and thrash him for torturing Masha.","Often he lay on his bed in the darkness listening to the deep stillness, and felt as though all round him life quivered, and twisted in a wild whirlpool with noise and outcry.","The whirlpool would suck him in, and sweep him away like a feather or a fallen leaf, and destroy him, and he shuddered with the premonition of something uncanny.","One evening, as he was about to close the shop, Pavel appeared, and said quietly, without greeting him: ""Vyera has run away.""","He sat down on a chair, rested his elbows on the counter, and whistled softly as he gazed out into the street.","His face was as though turned to stone, but his fair moustache twitched like a cat's whiskers.","""Alone?""",asked Ilya.,"""I don't know; it's three days ago.""",Ilya looked at him without speaking.,"The quiet face and voice made it impossible to tell how Gratschev felt the flight of his companion, but in the stillness Ilya was aware of an unalterable resolution.","""What are you going to do?""","he asked at length, when he saw that Pavel would not speak.","Pavel stopped whistling, and said sharply, without turning round: ""I'll cut her throat!""","""Ah!","talking like that again!""","cried Ilya, and with a gesture of annoyance.","""She's trod my heart under foot,"" said Pavel half-aloud.","""There's the knife!""",He drew from his bosom a little bread-knife and shook it.,"""I'll stick it in her throat.""","Ilya caught his hand, tore the knife away, and threw it on the counter, and said angrily: ""An ox once raged against a fly----"" Pavel sprang from his chair and turned his face on Ilya.","His eyes were blazing, his face convulsed, and he trembled in all his limbs; then he sank back again on his chair and said, contemptuously: ""You're a fool!""","""You're so very clever, aren't you?""","""The strength is in the hand, not in the knife.""","""Talk!""","""And if my hands fall off, I'd tear her windpipe with my teeth.""","""Don't talk so horribly!""","""Don't talk to me Ilya,"" said Pavel, once more quietly.","""Believe or don't believe, but don't torment me.","Fate is bad enough.""","""Think, think, you silly fellow----"" began Ilya, speaking in a friendly tone.","""I've thought for

could not believe that it was Masha, the friend of his childhood, once so gay, who sat before him.","She bared her shoulder and said in a toneless voice: ""See how my shoulder is knocked about!","Everything he can, all my body is pinched and hair torn out.""","""But why?""","""He's a beast.","He says, 'You don't love me,' and he pinches me.""","""Perhaps--before he married you, there

was going away, when she said anxiously: ""Don't go.",Stay a little.,"I'm so frightened alone--there's something haunts me.""","He sat down by the bed, looked once at her pale face, framed in its curls, and turned away.","All at once he was full of shame that she should lie there, hardly alive.","He remembered Jakov's entreaties, and Matiza's account of Masha's life, and he hung his head.","""And his father beats Jasha, they say.","Matiza says, 'What a life!'""",she said.,"""Such fathers,"" said Lunev between his teeth, interrupting her soft, lifeless speech.","""Such

golden honeysuckle, acacia, whitethorn and elder grew in the hedges, and their branches hid the graves.",Here and there in the dense green a slender grey wooden cross appeared and was lost immediately among the surrounding bushes.,White stems of young birch-trees glimmered like velvet through the thick network of leaves;

his hands were deep in his jacket pockets, and his feet braced against the ground.","Poluektov's monument represented a coffin, and carved on it an open book, and a skull and crossbones.","Beside it in the same enclosure was another smaller stone with an inscription that beneath it rested Eupraxia Poluektov, twenty-two years old.","""The first wife,"" thought Lunev.","The thought came from only a small part of his brain, that remained free from the straining labour of his memory.","He was gripped by the recollections of Poluektov; the first meeting, the murder, the feeling of the old man's saliva on his hands.","But while all this stirred to life in his memory, he felt no trouble, no remorse, he looked at the gravestone with hate and bitterness and deep ill-will; and under his breath, with hot anger in his heart, and a real conviction of the truth of his words, he addressed the merchant: ""It's for you, damn you, that I ruined all my life, for you!",You devil.,"What life is it I lead, through you!","I have smirched myself for ever through you.""","The words ""for you"" thumped in him like hammer strokes.","He longed to cry with all his might these words for every one to hear, and he could hardly restrain the fierce desire.","He pressed his teeth together till they ached, and stared before him while the thought of his life took hold of his soul like fire.","Before him appeared the little, spiteful face, and near it somehow the wicked, bald head of Strogany with the red eyebrows, the self-satisfied face of Petrusha, the stupid Kirik, the grey head of Ehrenov, snub-nosed and pig-eyed--a whole crowd of familiar faces.","There was a roaring in his ears, and it seemed as though all these men surrounded him, pressed on him, crowded him obstinately.","He stepped away from the tree; his cap fell down behind him; as he bent to pick it up, he could not help stealing a sidelong glance at the money-changer's gravestone.","He felt hot and sick, his face was full of blood, his eyes were strained with the tenseness of their gaze.","With great difficulty he tore them away, walked straight up to the enclosure, grasped the railings in his hands and trembling with hate, spat on the grave; as he went away he stamped his feet on the ground as though to free them from a pain.","He could not go home; his soul was heavy and a sense of sick, cold weariness grew suffocatingly upon him.","He walked with slow steps without looking at any one, without caring for anything, without thinking.","In this way he walked along one street, turned mechanically into a second at the corner, went on a little further, and then found himself close to Petrusha Filimonov's tavern; the thought of Jakov came into his mind.","As he passed by the door he felt that he must go in, though he had no wish to do so.",As he went up the steps he heard Perfishka's voice.,"""Oh!","good people, be tender with your hands and spare my sides.""",Lunev stood still in the open door;
