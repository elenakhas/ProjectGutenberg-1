yet, it seemed, they came to meet the train up among the mountain forests somewhere.","For in this village, where he had gone to study French, the moods of his own childhood had somehow known continuation and development.","The place had once been very dear to him, and he had known delightful adventures there, many of them with this cousin.",Now he took all his own childhood's sprites out in this Starlight Express and introduced them to these transplanted children who had never made acquaintance with the English breed.,"They had surprising, wild adventures all together, yet in the morning he could remember very little of it all.",The interfering sun melted them all down in dew.,"The adventures had some object, however;

two of them had tramped the Jura forests as boys.,They had met in London at intervals since.,"He dictated a letter to him then and there --Minks taking it down like lightning--and added a postscript in his own handwriting:-- 'I feel a longing,' he wrote, 'to come out and see the little haven of rest you have chosen, and to know your children.","Our ways have gone very far apart--too far--since the old days when we climbed out of the windows of _la cure_ with a sheet, and tramped the mountains all night long.",Do you remember?,"I've had my nose on the grindstone ever since, and you've worked hard too, judging by your name in publishers' lists.",I hope your books are a great success.,I'm ashamed I've never any time to read now.,"But I'm ""retired"" from business at last and hope to do

advance.,Tell them I shall come out in the Starlight Express.,Let me have a line to say if it's all right.',In due course the line--a warm-hearted one--arrived.,"Minks came to Charing Cross to see him off, the gleam of the sea already in his pale-blue eyes.","'The Weather Report says ""calm,"" Mr. Rogers,' he kept repeating.","'You'll have a good crossing, I hope and trust.","I'm taking Mrs. Minks myself---' 'Yes, yes, that's good,' was the quick reply.",'Capital.,"And--let me see-I've got your notes with me, haven't I?",I'll draft out a general plan and send it to you as soon as I get a moment.,"You think over it too, will you, while I'm away.",And enjoy yourself at the same time.,Put your children in the sea--nothing like the sea for children--sea and sun and sand and all that sort

remark, and the last third Mrs. Minks.",Her letter of thanks had never been referred to.,"It rankled, though very slightly.",'What an absurd-looking person!',"exclaimed the secretary to himself, following the aggressor with one eye, and trying to recapture the lost sentence at the same time.","'They really should not allow such people in a railway terminus,' he added aloud.","The man was ragged and unkempt to the last degree--a sort of tramp; and as he bought a ticket at the third-class wicket, just beyond, he kept looking up slyly at Minks and his companion.","'The way he knocked against me almost seemed intentional,' Minks thought.",The idea of pickpockets and cleverly disguised detectives ran confusedly in his mind.,He felt a little flustered for some reason.,"'I beg your pardon,' Mr. Rogers was saying to a man who tried to push in front of him.","'But we _must_ each take our turn, you know.'",The throng of people was considerable.,This man looked like a dustman.,"He, too, was eagerly buying a ticket, but had evidently mistaken the window.","'Third-class is lower down I think,' Mr. Rogers suggested with a touch of authority.","'What a lot of foreigners there are about,' remarked Minks.",'These stations are full of suspicious characters.',The notice about loitering flashed across him.,"He took the ticket Mr. Rogers handed to him, and went off to register the luggage, and when later he joined his chief at the carriage door he saw him talking to a couple of strangers who seemed anxious to get in.","'I took _this_ corner seat for you, Mr. Rogers,' he explained, both to prove his careful forethought and to let the strangers know that his master was a person of some importance.",They were such an extraordinary couple too!,Had there been hop-pickers about he could have understood it.,"They were almost figures of masquerade; for while one resembled more than anything else a chimney-sweep who had forgotten to wash his face below the level of the eyes, the other carried a dirty sack across his shoulders, which apparently he had just been trying to squeeze into the rack.","They moved off when they saw Minks, but the man with the sack made a gesture with one hand, as though he scattered something into the carriage through the open door.","The secretary threw a reproachful look at a passing guard, but there was nothing he could do.",People with tickets had a right to travel.,"Still, he resented these crowding, pushing folk.","'I'm sorry, Mr. Rogers,' he said, as though he had chosen a poor train for his honoured chief; 'there must be an excursion somewhere.","There's a big fete of Vegetarians, I know, at Surbiton to-day, but I can hardly think these people---' 'Don't wait, Minks,' said the other, who had taken his seat.","'I'll let you hear from me, you know, about the Scheme and--other things.",Don't wait.',"He seemed curiously unobservant of these strange folk, almost absent-minded.",The guard was whistling.,Minks shut the door and gave the travelling- rug a last tuck-in about his feet.,He felt as though he were packing off a child.,The mother in him became active.,Mr. Rogers needed looking after.,Another minute and he would have patted him and told him what to eat and wear.,But instead he raised his hat and smiled.,"The train moved slowly out, making a deep purring sound like flowing water.",The platform had magically thinned.,Officials stood lonely among the scattered wavers of hats and handkerchiefs.,"As he stepped backwards to keep the carriage window in sight until the last possible moment, Minks was nearly knocked over by a man who hurried along the platform as if he still had hopes of catching the train.","'Really, sir!'","gasped the secretary, stooping to pick up his newspaper and lavender glove--he wore one glove and carried the other--the collision had sent flying.",But the man was already far beyond the reach of his voice.,"'He must be an escaped lamplighter, or something,' he laughed good-naturedly, as he saw the long legs vanish down the platform.",He leaped on to the line.,Evidently he was a railway employe.,He seemed to be vainly trying to catch the departing buffers.,"An absurd and reckless fellow, thought Minks.","But what caught the secretary's attention last, and made him wonder a little if anything unusual was happening to the world, was the curious fact that, as the last carriage glided smoothly past, he recognised four figures seated comfortably inside.",Their feet were on the cushions--disgracefully.,"They were talking together, heads forward, laughing, even--singing.","And he could have sworn that they were the two men who had watched himself and Mr. Rogers at the ticket window, and the strangers who had tried to force their way into Mr. Rogers's carriage when he came up just in time to interfere.","'They got in somehow after all, then,' he said to himself.","'Of course, I had forgotten.",The Company runs third-class carriages on the continental trains now.,Odd!',He mentally rubbed his eyes.,"The train swept round the corner out of sight, leaving a streaming cloud of smoke and sparks behind it.","It went out with a kind of rush of delight, glad to be off, and conscious of its passengers' pleasure.",'Odd.',This was the word that filled his mind as he walked home.,'Perhaps--our minds are in such intimate sympathy together--perhaps he was thinking of--of that kind of thing--er--and some of his thoughts got into my own imagination.,"Odd, though, very, _very_ odd.'",He had once read somewhere in one of his new-fangled books that 'thoughts are things.',It had made a great impression on him.,He had read about Marconi too.,Later he made a more thorough study of this 'thinking business.',"And soon afterwards, having put his chief's papers in order at the flat, he went home to Mrs. Minks and the children with this other thought--that he had possibly been overworking himself, and that it was a good thing he was going to have a holiday by the sea.","He liked to picture himself as an original thinker, not afraid of new ideas, but in reality he preferred his world sober, ordinary, logical.",It was merely big-sounding names he liked.,And this little incident was somewhere out of joint.,It was--odd.,Success that poisons many a baser mind      May lift--- But the sonnet had never known completion.,In the space it had occupied in his mind another one abruptly sprouted.,The first subject after all was banal.,"A better one had come to him--      Strong thoughts that rise in a creative mind      May flash about the world, and carry joy--- Then it stuck.","He changed 'may' to 'shall,' but a moment later decided that 'do' was better, truer than either.",After that inspiration failed him.,He retired gracefully upon prose again.,"'Odd,' he thought, 'very odd!'",And he relieved his mind by writing a letter to a newspaper.,"He did not send it in the end, for his better judgment prevented, but he had to do something by way of protest, and the only alternative was to tell his wife about it, when she would look half puzzled, half pained, and probably reply with some remark about the general cost of living.",So he wrote the letter instead.,"For Herbert Minks regarded himself as a man with the larger view of citizenship, a critic of public affairs, and, in a measure, therefore, an item of that public opinion which moulded governments.","Hence he had a finger, though but a little finger, in the destiny of nations and in the polity--a grand word that!--of national councils.","He wrote frequent letters, thus, to the lesser weekly journals; these letters were sometimes printed; occasionally--oh, joy!--they were answered by others like himself, who referred to him as 'your esteemed correspondent.'","As yet, however, his following letter had never got into print, nor had he experienced the importance of that editorial decision, appended between square brackets: 'This correspondence must now cease'--so vital, that is, that the editor and the entire office staff might change their opinions unless it _did_ cease.","Having drafted his letter, therefore, and carried it about with him for several hours in his breast pocket, he finally decided not to send it after all, for the explanation of his 'odd' experience, he well knew, was hardly one that a newspaper office could supply, or that public correspondence could illuminate.",His better judgment always won the day in the end.,"Thinking _was_ creative, after all.",CHAPTER VII

sleep.",W. E. HENLEY.,In a southern-facing room on the first floor of La Citadelle the English family sat after tea.,"The father, a spare, mild-eyed man, his thatch of brown hair well sprinkled with grey above the temples, was lighting his pipe for the tenth time-the tenth match, but the same pipeful of tobacco; and his wife, an ample, motherly woman, slightly younger than himself, was knitting on the other side of the open fireplace, in which still glowed a mass of peat ashes.","From time to time she stirred them with a rickety pair of tongs, or with her foot kicked into the grate the matches he invariably threw short upon the floor.",But these were adventures ill-suited to her.,Knitting was her natural talent.,She was always knitting.,"By the open window stood two children, a boy and a girl of ten and twelve respectively, gazing out into the sunshine.","It was the end of April, and though the sun was already hot, there was a sharpness in the air that told of snow still lying on the mountain heights behind the village.","Across vineyard slopes and patches of agricultural land, the Lake of Neuchatel lay blue as a southern sea, while beyond it, in a line of white that the sunset soon would turn to pink and gold, stretched the whole range of Alps, from Mont Blanc to where the Eiger and the Weisshorn signalled in the east.","They filled the entire horizon, already cloud-like in the haze of coming summer.","The door into the corridor opened, and a taller child came in.","A mass of dark hair, caught by a big red bow, tumbled untidily down her back.","She was sixteen and very earnest, but her eyes, brown like her father's, held a curious puzzled look, as though life still confused her so much that while she did her duties bravely she did not quite understand why it should be so.","'Excuse me, Mother, shall I wash up?'",she said at once.,She always did wash up.,And 'excuse me' usually prefaced her questions.,"'Please, Jane Anne,' said Mother.","The entire family called her Jane Anne, although her baptismal names were rather fine.","Sometimes she answered, too, to Jinny, but when it was a question of household duties it was Jane Anne, or even 'Ria.'","She set about her duties promptly, though not with any special deftness.",And first she stooped and picked up the last match her father had dropped upon the strip of carpet that covered the linoleum.,"'Daddy,' she said reprovingly, 'you do make such a mess.'",She brushed tobacco ashes from his coat.,"Mother, without looking up, went on talking to him about the bills-washing, school-books, boots, blouses, oil, and peat.",And as she did so a puzzled expression was visible in his eyes akin to the expression in Jane Anne's.,Both enjoyed a similar mental confusion sometimes as to words and meanings and the import of practical life generally.,"'We shan't want any more now, thank goodness,' he said vaguely, referring to the peat, though Mother was already far ahead, wading among boots and shirts and blouses.","'But if we get a load in now, you see, it's _cheaper_,' she said with emphasis on every alternate word, slowing up the pace to suit him.","'Mother, where _did_ you put the washing-up rag?'",came the voice of Jinny in plaintive accents from the tiny kitchen that lay beyond the adjoining bedroom.,"'I can't find it anywhere,' she added, poking her head round the door suddenly.","'Pet lamb,' was Mother's answer, still bending over her knitting-she was prodigal of terms like this and applied them indiscriminately, for Jane Anne resembled the animal in question even less than did her father--'I saw it last on the geranium shelf--you know, where the fuchsias and the-' She hesitated, she was not sure herself.","'I'll get it, my duckie, for you,' she added, and began to rise.","She was a voluminous, very stately woman.",The operation took time.,"'Let me,' said Daddy, drawing his mind with difficulty from the peat, and rising too.",They rose together.,"'It's all right, I've got it,' cried the child, who had disappeared again.",'It was in the sink.,That's Jimbo; he washed up yesterday.','Pas vrai!',"piped a little voice beside the open window, overhearing his name, 'because I only dried.",It was Monkey who washed up.',They talked French and English all mixed up together.,"But Monkey was too busy looking at the Alps through an old pair of opera-glasses, relic of her father's London days that served for telescope, to think reply worth while.","Her baptismal names were also rather wonderful, though neither of her parents could have supplied them without a moment's reflection first.","There was commotion by that window for a moment but it soon subsided again, for things that Jinny said never provoked dissension, and Jimbo and Monkey just then were busy with a Magic Horse who had wings of snow, and was making fearful leaps from the peaks of the Dent du Midi across the Blumlisalp to the Jungfrau.",'Will you please carry the samovar for me?',"exclaimed Jane Anne, addressing both her parents, as though uncertain which of them would help her.","'You filled it so awfully full to-day, I can't lift it.",I advertise for help.',Her father slowly rose.,"'I'll do it, child,' he said kindly, but with a patience, almost resignation, in his tone suggesting that it was absurd to expect such a thing of him.","'Then do exactly as you think best,' he let fall to his wife as he went, referring to the chaos of expenses she had been discussing with him.",'That'll be all right.',"For his mind had not yet sorted the jumble of peat, oil, boots, school- books, and the rest.","'We can manage THAT at any rate; you see it's francs, not shillings,' he added, as Jane Anne pulled him by the sleeve towards the steaming samovar.",He held the strings of an ever empty purse.,"'Daddy, but you've _always_ got a crumb in your beard,' she was saying, 'and if it isn't a crumb, it's ashes on your coat or a match on the floor.'",She brushed the crumb away.,He gave her a kiss.,And between them they nearly upset the old nickel-plated samovar that was a present from a Tiflis Armenian to whom the mother once taught English.,They looked round anxiously as though afraid of a scolding; but Mother had not noticed.,And she was accustomed to the noise and laughter.,"The scene then finished, as it usually did, by the mother washing up, Jane Anne drying, and Daddy hovering to and fro in the background making remarks in his beard about the geraniums, the China tea, the indigestible new bread, the outrageous cost of the necessaries of life, or the book he was at work on at the moment.","He often enough gave his uncertain assistance in the little menial duties connected with the preparation or removal of the tea-things, and had even been known to dry.",Only washing-up he never did.,Somehow his vocation rendered him immune from that.,"He might bring the peat in, fill the lamps, arrange and dust the scanty furniture, but washing-up was not a possibility even.","As an author it was considered beneath his dignity altogether, almost improper--it would have shocked the children.","Mother could do anything; it was right and natural that she should---poor soul I But Daddy's profession set him in an enclosure apart, and there were certain things in this servantless menage he could not have done without disgracing the entire family.",Washing-up was one; carrying back the empty basket of tea-things to the Pension was another.,Daddy wrote books.,"As Jane Anne put it forcibly and finally once, 'Shakespeare never washed up or carried a tea-basket in the street!'",--which the others accepted as a conclusive statement of authority.,"And, meantime, the two younger children, who knew how to amuse each other for hours together unaided, had left the Magic Horse in its stables for the night--an enormous snow-drift--and were sitting side by side upon the sofa conning a number of _Punch_ some English aunt had sent them.","The girl read out the jokes, and her brother pointed with a very dirty finger to the pictures.","None of the jokes were seized by either, but Jimbo announced each one with, 'Oh!",I say!',"and their faces were grave and sometimes awed; and when Jimbo asked, 'But what does THAT mean?'","his sister would answer, 'Don't you see, I suppose the cabman meant--' finishing with some explanation very far from truth, whereupon Jimbo, accepting it doubtfully, said nothing, and they turned another page with keen anticipation.","They never appealed for outside aid, but enjoyed it in their own dark, mysterious way.","And, presently, when the washing-up was finished, and the dusk began to dim the landscape and conceal the ghostly-looking Alps, they retired to the inner bedroom--for this was Saturday and there were no school tasks to be prepared--and there, seated on the big bed in the corner, they opened a book of _cantiques_ used in school, and sang one hymn and song after another, interrupting one another with jokes and laughter and French and English sentences oddly mixed together.","Jimbo sang the tune, and Monkey the alto.",It was by no means unpleasant to listen to.,"And, upon the whole, it was a very grave business altogether, graver even than their attitude to ""Punch.""","Jane Anne considered it a foolish waste of time, but she never actually said so.",She smiled her grave smile and went her own puzzled way alone.,"Usually at this hour the Den presented a very different appearance, the children, with slates and _cahiers_, working laboriously round the table, Jane Anne and mother knitting or mending furiously, Mere Riquette, the old cat, asleep before the fire, and a general schoolroom air pervading the place.","The father, too, tea once finished, would depart for the little room he slept in and used as work-place over at the carpenter's house among the vineyards.","He kept his books there, his rows of pipes and towering little heap of half- filled match-boxes, and there he wrote his clever studies that yet were unproductive of much gold and brought him little more than pleasant notices and occasional letters from enthusiastic strangers.","It seemed very unremunerative labour indeed, and the family had done well to migrate from Essex into Switzerland, where, besides the excellent schools which cost barely two pounds annually per head, the children learned the language and enjoyed the air of forest and mountain into the bargain.","Life, for all that, was a severe problem to them, and the difficulty of making both ends come in sight of each other, let alone meeting, was an ever-present one.","That they jogged along so well was due more than the others realised to the untiring and selfless zeal of the Irish mother, a plucky, practical woman, and a noble one if ever such existed on this earth.","The way she contrived would fill a book; her economies, so clever they hardly betrayed themselves, would supply a comic annual with material for years, though their comedy involved a pathos of self-denial and sleepless nights that only those similarly placed could have divined.","Herself a silent, even inarticulate, woman, she never spoke of them, least of all to her husband, whose mind it was her brave desire to keep free from unnecessary worries for his work.","His studies she did not understand, but his stories she read aloud with patient resignation to the children.","She marked the place when the reading was interrupted with a crimson paper-knife, and often Jimbo would move it several pages farther on without any of them discovering the gap.","Jane Anne, however, who made no pretence of listening to 'Daddy's muddle- stories,' was beginning to realise what went on in Mother's mind underground.","She hardly seized the pathos, but she saw and understood enough to help.","And she was in many ways a little second edition--a phrase the muddle-stories never knew, alas!--of her mother, with the same unselfishness that held a touch of grandeur, the same clever domestic instinct for contrivance, and the same careful ways that yet sat ill upon a boundless generosity of heart beneath.","She loved to be thought older than she was, and she used the longest, biggest, grandest words she could possibly invent or find.","And the village life suited them all in all respects, for, while there was no degrading poverty anywhere, all the inhabitants, from the pasteur to the carpenter, knew the exact value of a centime; there was no question of keeping up impossible appearances, but a general frankness with regard to the fundamental values of clothing, food, and education that all shared alike and made no pretence about.","Any faintest sign of snobbery, for instance, would have been drummed out of the little mountain hamlet at once by Gygi, the gendarme, who spent more time in his fields and vineyards than in his uniform.","And, while every one knew that a title and large estates were a not impossible future for the famille anglaise, it made no slightest difference in the treatment of them, and indeed hardly lent them the flavour of a faintest cachet.","They were the English family in La Citadelle, and that was all there was about it.","The peasants, however, rather pitied the hard-working author who 'had to write all those books,' than paid him honourable tribute for his work.",It seemed so unnecessary.,"Vineyards produced wine a man could drink and pay for, but books---!","Well, results spoke for themselves, and no one who lived in La Citadelle was millionaire.","Yet the reputation of John Frederic Campden stood high enough, for all his meagre earnings, and he was an ineffective author chiefly, perhaps, because he missed his audience.","Somewhere, somehow, he fell between two stools.","And his chagrin was undeniable; for though the poet's heart in him kept all its splendid fires alight, his failure chilled a little the intellect that should fashion them along effective moulds.","Now, with advancing years, the increasing cost of the children's growing-up, and the failing of his wife's health a little, the burdens of life were heavier than he cared to think about.","But this evening, as the group sat round the wide peat fire, cheerful and jolly in the lamplight, there was certainly no sign of sadness.",They were like a party of children in which the grave humour of the ever-knitting mother kept the balance true between fun and foolishness.,"'Please, Daddy, a story at once,' Jane Anne demanded, 'but a told one, not a read-aloud one.",I like a romantic effort best.',"He fumbled in his pocket for a light, and Jimbo gravely produced a box he had secretly filled with matches already used, collected laboriously from the floor during the week.","Then Monkey, full of mischief, came over from the window where she had been watching them with gasps of astonishment no one had heeded through the small end of the opera-glasses.","There was a dancing brilliance in her movements, and her eyes, brown like her mother's, sparkled with fun and wickedness.","Taking the knee Jimbo left unoccupied, and waiting till the diversion caused by the match-box had subsided, she solemnly placed a bread-crumb in his rather tangled beard.","'Now you're full-dress,' she said, falling instantly so close against him that he could not tickle her, while Mother glanced up a second uncertain whether to criticise the impertinence or let it pass.",She let it pass.,None of the children had the faintest idea what it meant to be afraid of their father.,"'People who waste bread,' he began, 'end by getting so thin themselves that they double up like paper and disappear.'","'But _how_ thin, Daddy?'","asked Jane Anne, ever literal to the death.",'And is it romantic or just silly?',He was puzzled for a moment what to reply.,'He doesn't know.,"He's making up,' piped Jimbo.","'I _do_ know,' came the belated explanation, as he put the crumb into the bowl of his extinguished pipe with a solemnity that delighted them, but puzzled Jane Anne, who suggested it would taste 'like toast smelt.'","'People who take bread that doesn't belong to them end by having no dinner---' 'But that isn't anything about thinness,' interrupted Jinny, still uncomforted.",Some one wasted by love was in her mind perhaps.,"'It is, child, because they get so frightfully thin,' he went on, 'that they end by getting thinner than the thin end of a wedge.'","The eyes of Mother twinkled, but the children still stared, waiting.",They had never heard of this phrase about the wedge.,Indeed Jane Anne shared with Jimbo total ignorance of the word at all.,"Like the audience who read his books, or rather ought to have read them, they expected something different, yet still hoped.","'It's a rhyme, and not a story though,' he added, anticipating perhaps their possible disappointment.","For the recent talk about expenses had chilled his imagination too much for an instantaneous story, whereas rhymes came ever to him easily.",'All right!,"Let's have it anyhow,' came the verdict in sentences of French and English.","And in the breathless pause that followed, even Mother looking up expectantly from her busy fingers, was heard this strange fate of the Thin Child who stole another's bread-crumb:--      He then grew thinner than the thin,      The thin end of the wedge;      He grew so pitifully thin      It set his teeth on edge;      But the edge it set his teeth upon      Was worse than getting thinner,      For it was the edge of appetite,      And his teeth were in no dinner!",There was a deep silence.,"Mother looked as though she expected more,-- the good part yet to come.","The rhyme fell flat as a pancake, for of course the children did not understand it.","Its nonsense, clever enough, escaped them.",True nonsense is for grown-ups only.,Jane Anne stared steadily at him with a puzzled frown.,Her face wore an expression like a moth.,"'Thank you, Daddy, _very_ much,' she said, certain as ever that the fault if any was her own, since all that Daddy said and did was simply splendid.","Whereupon the others fairly screamed with delight, turning attention thereby from the dismal failure.","'She doesn't understand it, but she's always so polite!'",cried Monkey.,Her mother quickly intervened.,"'Never mind, Jane Anne,' she soothed her, lest her feelings should be ruffled; 'you shall never want a dinner, lovey; and when all Monkey's teeth are gone you'll still be able to munch away at something.'","But Jinny's feelings were never ruffled exactly, only confused and puzzled.",She was puzzled now.,Her confidence in her father's splendour was unshakable.,"'And, anyhow, Mother, you'll never be a thin wedge,' she answered, meaning to show her gratitude by a compliment.",She joined herself as loudly as anybody in the roar that followed this sally.,"Obviously, she had said a clever and amusing thing, though it was not clear to her why it was so.",Her flushed face was very happy; it even wore a touch of proud superiority.,Her talents were domestic rather than intellectual.,"'Excuse me, Daddy,' she said gravely, in a pause that followed presently.","'But what is a wedge, exactly?","And I think I'd like to copy that poetry in my book, please.'","For she kept a book in which his efforts were neatly inscribed in a round copy-book handwriting, and called by Monkey 'The Muddle Book.'","There his unappreciated doggerels found fame, though misunderstood most of all by the affectionate child who copied them so proudly.",The book was brought at once.,Her father wrote out the nonsense verse on his knee and made a funny little illustration in the margin.,"'Oh, I say!'","said Jimbo, watching him, while Monkey, lapsing into French, contributed with her usual impudence, 'Pas tant mal!'",They all loved the illustrations.,"The general interest, then, as the way is with children, puppies, and other young Inconsistencies, centred upon the contents of the book.","They eagerly turned the pages, as though they did not know its contents by heart already.","They praised for the hundredth time the drawing of the Muddle Animal who      Hung its hopes upon a nail      Or laid them on the shelf;      Then pricked its conscience with its tail,      And sat upon itself.","They looked also with considerable approval upon the drawings and descriptions of the Muddle Man whose manners towards the rest of the world were cool; because      He saw things with his naked eye,      That's why his glance was chilly.",But the explanation of the disasters he caused everywhere by his disagreeable sharpness of speech and behaviour did _not_ amuse them.,"They observed as usual that it was 'too impossible'; the drawings, moreover, did not quite convince:--      So cutting was his speaking tone      Each phrase snipped off a button,      So sharp his words, they have been known      To carve a leg of mutton;      He shaved himself with sentences,      And when he went to dances,      He made--Oh shocking tendencies!-      Deep holes with piercing glances.","But on the last page the Muddle Man behaved so badly, was so positively indecent in his conduct, that he was persuaded to disappear altogether; and his manner of extinguishing himself in the illustration delighted the children far more than the verse whose fun again escaped them:--      They observed he was indecent,      But he said it wasn't true,      For _he_ pronounced it 'in descent'--      Then disappeared from view!",Mother's alleged 'second sight' was also attributed to the fact that she 'looked twice before she leaped'--and the drawing of that leap never failed to produce high spirits.,"For her calm and steady way of walking--sailing--had earned her the name of the frigate--and this was also illustrated, with various winds, all coloured, driving her along.","The time passed happily; some one turned the lamp out, and Daddy, regardless of expense--he had been grumbling about it ten minutes before--heaped on the bricks of peat.","Riquette, a bit of movable furniture without which the room seemed incomplete, deftly slipped in between the circle of legs and feet, and curled up upon Jinny's lap.","Her snoring, a wheezy noise that made Jimbo wonder 'why it didn't scrape her,' was as familiar as the ticking of the clock.",Old Mere Riquette knew her rights.,And she exacted them.,Jinny's lap was one of these.,"She had a face like an old peasant woman, with a curious snub nose and irregular whiskers that betrayed recklessly the advance of age.",Her snores and gentle purring filled the room now.,A hush came over the whole party.,"At seven o'clock they must all troop over to the Pension des Glycines for supper, but there was still an hour left.",And it was a magic hour.,"Sighs were audible here and there, as the exhausted children settled deeper into their chairs.",A change came over the atmosphere.,Would nothing exciting ever happen?,"'The stars are out,' said Jimbo in his soft, gentle little voice, turning his head towards the windows.","The others looked too--all except Mother, whose attitude suggested suspiciously that she slept, and Riquette, who most certainly did sleep.",Above the rampart of the darkened Alps swung up the army of the stars.,The brighter ones were reflected in the lake.,The sky was crowded.,"Tiny, golden pathways slid down the purple walls of the night.",'Some one in heaven is letting down the star-ladders...' he whispered.,Jimbo's sentence had marked the change of key.,Enchantment was abroad --the Saturday evening spell was in the room.,And suddenly a new enormous thing stirred in their father's heart.,"Whence it came, or why, he knew not.","Like a fire it rose in him deep down, from very far away, delightful.","Was it an inspiration coming, he wondered?",And why did Jimbo use that phrase of beauty about star- ladders?,How did it come into the mind of a little boy?,"The phrase opened a new channel in the very depths of him, thence climbing up and outwards, towards the brain.... And, with a thrill of curious high wonder, he let it come.",It was large and very splendid.,"It came with a rush--as of numerous whispering voices that flocked about him, urging some exquisite, distant sweetness in him to unaccustomed delivery.",A softness of ten thousand stars trooped down into his blood.,Some constellation like the Pleiades had flung their fiery tackle across the dusk upon his mind.,His thought turned golden....

D. PRINCE.","'A star-story, please,' the boy repeated, cuddling up.","They all drew, where possible, nearer.","Their belief in their father's powers, rarely justified, was pathetic.","Each time they felt sure he would make the adventures seem real, yet somehow he never quite did.",They were aware that it was invention only.,These things he told about he had not experienced himself.,"For they badly needed a leader, these children; and Daddy just missed filling the position.","He was too 'clever,' his imagination neither wild nor silly enough, for children.",And he felt it.,He threw off rhymes and stories for them in a spirit of bravado rather--an expression of disappointment.,Yet there was passion in them too--concealed.,The public missed the heart he showed them in his books in the same way.,"'The stars are listening....' Jimbo's voice sounded far away, almost outside the window.",Mother now snored audibly.,Daddy took his courage in both hands and made the plunge.,"'You know about the Star Cavern, I suppose--?'",he began.,"It was the sudden idea that had shot into him, he knew not whence.",'No.','Never heard of it.',"'Where is it, please?'",'Don't interrupt.,That wasn't a _real_ question.,Stories always begin like that.',It was Jane Anne who thus finally commanded order.,"'It's not a story exactly, but a sort of adventure,' he continued, hesitating yet undaunted.",'Star Caverns are places where the unused starlight gathers.,"There are numbers of them about the world, and one I know of is up here in our mountains,' he pointed through the north wall towards the pine-clad Jura, 'not far from the slopes of Boudry where the forests dip towards the precipices of the Areuse--' The phrase ran oddly through him like an inspiration, or the beginning of a song he once had heard somewhere.","'Ah, beyond le Vallon Vert?","I know,' whispered Jimbo, his blue eyes big already with wonder.","'Towards the precipices on the farther side,' came the explanation, 'where there are those little open spaces among the trees.'","'Tell us more exactly, please.'","'Star-rays, you see,' he evaded them, 'are visible in the sky on their way to us, but once they touch the earth they disappear and go out like a candle.","Unless a chance puddle, or a pair of eyes happens to be about to catch them, you can't tell where they've gone to.",They go really into these Star Caverns.',"'But in a puddle or a pair of eyes they'd be lost just the same,' came the objection.","'On the contrary,' he said; 'changed a little--increased by reflection--but not lost.'","There was a pause; the children stared, expectantly.",Here was mystery.,"'See how they mirror themselves whenever possible,' he went on, 'doubling their light and beauty by giving themselves away!",What is a puddle worth until a Star's wee golden face shines out of it?,And then--what gold can buy it?,And what are your eyes worth until a star has flitted in and made a nest there?',"'Oh, like that, you mean--!'","exclaimed Jane Anne, remembering that the wonderful women in the newspaper stories always had 'starry eyes.'","'Like that, yes.'",Daddy continued.,"'Their light puts sympathy in you, and only sympathy makes you lovely and--and--' He stopped abruptly.",He hesitated a moment.,"He was again most suddenly aware that this strange idea that was born in him came from somewhere else, almost from _some one_ else.","It was not his own idea, nor had he captured it completely yet.","Like a wandering little inspiration from another mind it seemed passing through him on uncertain, feathery feet.",He had suddenly lost it again.,Thought wandered.,"He stared at Jimbo, for Jimbo somehow seemed the channel.","The children waited, then talked among themselves.",Daddy so often got muddled and inattentive in this way.,"They were accustomed to it, expected it even.","'I always love being out at night,' said Monkey, her eyes very bright; 'it sort of excites and makes me soft and happy.'","'Excuse me, Daddy, but have you been inside one?",What's it like?,"The Cave, I mean?'",Jinny stuck to the point.,She had not yet travelled beyond it.,"'It all collects in there and rises to the top like cream,' he went on, 'and has a little tiny perfume like wild violets, and by walking through it you get clothed and covered with it, and come out again all soft-shiny--' 'What's soft-shiny, please?'",'Something half-primrose and half-moon.,You're like a star--' 'But how--like a star?',"'Why,' he explained gently, yet a little disappointed that his adventure was not instantly accepted, 'you shine, and your eyes twinkle, and everybody likes you and thinks you beautiful--' 'Even if you're not?'",inquired Jinny.,'But you _are_--' 'Couldn't we go there now?,Mother's fast asleep!',suggested Jimbo in a mysterious whisper.,He felt a curious excitement.,"This, he felt, was more real than usual.",He glanced at Monkey's eyes a moment.,"'Another time,' said Daddy, already half believing in the truth of his adventure, yet not quite sure of himself.","'It collects, and collects, and collects.","Sometimes, here and there, a little escapes and creeps out into yellow flowers like dandelions and buttercups.","A little, too, slips below the ground and fills up empty cracks between the rocks.","Then it hardens, gets dirty, and men dig it out again and call it gold.","And some slips out by the roof--though very, very little--and you see it flashing back to find the star it belongs to, and people with telescopes call it a shooting star, and--' It came pouring through him again.","'But when you're in it--in the Cavern,' asked Monkey impatiently; 'what happens then?'","'Well,' he answered with conviction, 'it sticks to you.","It sticks to the eyes most, but a little also to the hair and voice, and nobody loves you unless you've got a bit of it somewhere on you.","A girl, before any one falls in love with her, has always been there, and people who write stories and music and things--all have got some on their fingers or else nobody cares for what they write--' 'Oh, Daddy, then why don't you go there and get sticky all over with it?'","Jinny burst out with sudden eagerness, ever thinking of others before herself.",'I'll go and get some for you--lots and lots.',"'I _have_ been there,' he answered slowly, 'once long, long ago.",But it didn't stick very well with me.,It wipes off so quickly in the day- time.,The sunlight kills it.','But you got _some_!',the child insisted.,"'And you've got it still, I mean?'","'A little, perhaps, a very little.'",All felt the sadness in his voice without understanding it.,There was a moment's pause.,"Then the three of them spoke in a single breath-- 'Please show it to us--_now_,' they cried.","'I'll try,' he said, after a slight hesitation, 'but--er--it's only a rhyme, you see'; and then began to murmur very low for fear of waking Mother: he almost sang it to them.",The flock of tiny voices whispered it to his blood.,"He merely uttered what he heard:--      Starlight      Runs along my mind      And rolls into a ball of golden silk--      A little skein      Of tangled glory;      And when I want to get it out again      To weave the pattern of a verse or story,      It must unwind.","It then gets knotted, looped, and all up-jumbled,      And long before I get it straight again, unwumbled,      To make my verse or story,      The interfering sun has risen      And burst with passion through my silky prison      To melt it down in dew,      Like so much spider-gossamer or fairy-cotton.",Don't you?,_I_ call it rotten!,A hushed silence followed.,Eyes sought the fire.,No one spoke for several minutes.,"There was a faint laughter, quickly over, but containing sighs.","Only Jinny stared straight into her father's face, expecting more, though prepared at any stage to explode with unfeigned admiration.","'But that ""don't you"" comes in the wrong place,' she objected anxiously.","'It ought to come after ""I call it rotten""---' She was determined to make it seem all right.","'No, Jinny,' he answered gravely, 'you must always put others before yourself.",It's the first rule in life and literature.',She dropped her eyes to the fire like the others.,"'Ah,' she said, 'I see; of course.'","The long word blocked her mind like an avalanche, even while she loved it.","'_I_ call it rotten,' murmured Monkey under her breath.",Jimbo made no audible remark.,He crossed his little legs and folded his arms.,He was not going to express an opinion until he understood better what it was all about.,He began to whisper to his sister.,Another longish pause intervened.,It was Jinny again who broke it.,"'And ""wumbled,""' she asked solemnly as though the future of everybody depended on it, 'what _is_ wumbled, really?","There's no such thing, is there?--In life, I mean?'","She meant to add 'and literature,' but the word stopped her like a hedge.","'It's what happens to a verse or story I lose in that way,' he explained, while Jimbo and Monkey whispered more busily still among themselves about something else.","'The bit of starlight that gets lost and doesn't stick, you see--ineffective.'","'But there _is_ no such word, really,' she urged, determined to clear up all she could.",'It rhymes--that's all.',"'And there _is_ no verse or story,' he replied with a sigh.",'There _was_--that's all.',There was another pause.,Jimbo and Monkey looked round suspiciously.,They ceased their mysterious whispering.,They clearly did not wish the others to know what their confabulation was about.,"'That's why your books are wumbled, is it?'","she inquired, proud of an explanation that excused him, yet left his glory somehow unimpaired.",Her face was a map of puzzled wrinkles.,"'Precisely, Jinny.","You see, the starlight never gets through properly into my mind.",It lies there in a knot.,My plot is wumbled.,"I can't disentangle it quite, though the beauty lies there right enough---' 'Oh, yes,' she interrupted, 'the beauty lies there still.'",She got up suddenly and gave him a kiss.,"'Never mind, Daddy,' she whispered.",'I'll get it straight for you one day.,I'll unwumble it.,"I'll do it like a company promoter, I will.'",She used words culled from newspapers.,"'Thank you, child,' he smiled, returning her kiss; 'I'm sure you will.","Only, you'd better let me know when you're coming.",It might be dangerous to my health otherwise.',She took it with perfect seriousness.,"'Oh, but, excuse me, I'll come when you're asleep,' she told him, so low that the others could not hear.",'I'll come to you when I'm dreaming.,I dream all night like a busy Highlander.',"'That's right,' he whispered, giving her a hug.","'Come when I'm asleep and all the stars are out; and bring a comb and a pair of scissors---' 'And a hay-rake,' added Monkey, overhearing.",Everybody laughed.,The children cuddled up closer to him.,They pitied him.,"He had failed again, though his failure was as much a pleasure as his complete success.","They sat on his knees and played with him to make up for it, repeating bits of the rhyme they could remember.","Then Mother and Riquette woke up together, and the spell was broken.",The party scattered.,"Only Jimbo and his younger sister, retiring into a corner by themselves, continued their mysterious confabulation.",Their faces were flushed with excitement.,There was a curious animation in their eyes--though this may have been borrowed from the embers of the peat.,"Or, it may have been the stars, for they were close to the open window.",Both seemed soft-shiny somehow.,"_They_, certainly, were not wumbled.","And several hours later, when they had returned from supper at the Pension and lay in bed, exchanging their last mysterious whispers across the darkness, Monkey said in French-- 'Jimbo, I'm going to find that Cavern where the star stuff lies,' and Jimbo answered audaciously, 'I've already been there.'","'Will you show me the way, then?'","she asked eagerly, and rather humbly.","'Perhaps,' he answered from beneath the bedclothes, then added, 'Of course I will.'",He merely wished to emphasise the fact that he was leader.,"'Sleep quickly, then, and join me--over there.'",It was their game to believe they joined in one another's dreams.,They slept.,And the last thing that reached them from the outer world was their mother's voice calling to them her customary warning: that the _ramoneur_ was already in the chimney and that unless they were asleep in five minutes he would come and catch them by the tail.,For the Sweep they looked upon with genuine awe.,His visits to the village--once in the autumn and once in the spring--were times of shivery excitement.,Presently Mother rose and sailed on tiptoe round the door to peep.,And a smile spread softly over her face as she noted the characteristic evidences of the children beside each bed.,"Monkey's clothes lay in a scattered heap of confusion, half upon the floor, but Jimbo's garments were folded in a precise, neat pile upon the chair.",They looked ready to be packed into a parcel.,His habits were so orderly.,"His school blouse hung on the back, the knickerbockers were carefully folded, and the black belt lay coiled in a circle on his coat and what he termed his 'westkit.'",Beneath the chair the little pair of very dirty boots stood side by side.,Mother stooped and kissed the round plush-covered head that just emerged from below the mountainous _duvet_.,He looked like a tiny radish lying in a big ploughed field.,"Then, hunting for a full five minutes before she discovered the shoes of Monkey, one beneath the bed and the other inside her petticoat, she passed on into the little kitchen where she cleaned and polished both pairs, and then replaced them by their respective owners.","This done, she laid the table in the outer room for their breakfast at half-past six, saw that their school-books and satchels were in order, gave them each a little more unnecessary tucking-up and a kiss so soft it could not have waked a butterfly, and then returned to her chair before the fire where she resumed the mending of a pile of socks and shirts, blouses and stockings, to say nothing of other indescribable garments, that lay in a formidable heap upon the big round table.",This was her nightly routine.,Sometimes her husband joined her.,"Then they talked the children over until midnight, discussed expenses that threatened to swamp them, yet turned out each month 'just manageable somehow' and finally made a cup of cocoa before retiring, she to her self-made bed upon the sofa, and he to his room in the carpenter's house outside the village.",But sometimes he did not come.,"He remained in the Pension to smoke and chat with the Russian and Armenian students, who attended daily lectures in the town, or else went over to his own quarters to work at the book he was engaged on at the moment.",To-night he did not come.,"A light in an attic window, just visible above the vineyards, showed that he was working.",The room was very still; only the click of the knitting needles or the soft noise of the collapsing peat ashes broke the stillness.,Riquette snored before the fire less noisily than usual.,"'He's working very late to-night,' thought Mother, noticing the lighted window.",She sighed audibly; mentally she shrugged her shoulders.,Daddy had long ago left that inner preserve of her heart where she completely understood him.,"Sympathy between them, in the true sense of the word, had worn rather thin.","'I hope he won't overtire himself,' she added, but this was the habit of perfunctory sympathy.","She might equally have said, 'I wish he would do something to bring in a little money instead of earning next to nothing and always complaining about the expenses.'","Outside the stars shone brightly through the fresh spring night, where April turned in her sleep, dreaming that May was on the way to wake her.","CHAPTER IX      Wrap thy form in a mantle gray,                  Star-inwrought!","Blind with thine hair the eyes of Day;       Kiss her until she be wearied out,       Then wander o'er city,

adored by some, yet regarded with suspicious aversion by others.","They know so much they never dare to tell, while affecting that they know nothing and are innocent.","For it is beyond question that several hours later, when the village and the Citadelle were lost in slumber, Mere Riquette stirred stealthily where she lay upon the hearth, opened her big green eyes, and--began to wash.",But this toilette was pretence in case any one was watching.,"Really, she looked about her all the time.",Her sleep also had been that sham sleep of cats behind which various plots and plans mature--a questionable business altogether.,"The washing, as soon as she made certain no one saw her, gave place to another manoeuvre.",She stretched as though her bones were of the very best elastic.,"Gathering herself together, she arched her round body till it resembled a toy balloon straining to rise against the pull of four thin ropes that held it tightly to the ground.","Then, unable to float off through the air, as she had expected, she slowly again subsided.",The balloon deflated.,"She licked her chops, twitched her whiskers, curled her tail neatly round her two front paws--and grinned complacently.",She waited before that extinguished fire of peat as though she had never harboured a single evil purpose in all her days.,"'A saucer of milk,' she gave the world to understand, c is the only thing _I_ care about.'",Her smile of innocence and her attitude of meek simplicity proclaimed this to the universe at large.,"'That's me,' she told the darkness, 'and I don't care a bit who knows it.'",She looked so sleek and modest that a mouse need not have feared her.,"But she did not add, 'That's what I mean the world to think,' for this belonged to the secret life cats never talk about.","Those among humans might divine it who could, and welcome.",They would be admitted.,But the rest of the world were regarded with mere tolerant disdain.,They bored.,"Then, satisfied that she was unobserved, Mere Riquette abandoned all further pretence, and stalked silently about the room.","The starlight just made visible her gliding shadow, as first she visited the made-up sofa-bed where the exhausted mother snored mildly beneath the book- shelves, and then, after a moment's keen inspection, turned back and went at a quicker pace into the bedroom where the children slept.",There the night-light made her movements easily visible.,The cat was excited.,Something bigger than any mouse was coming into her life just now.,"Riquette then witnessed a wonderful and beautiful thing, yet witnessed it obviously not for the first time.",Her manner suggested no surprise.,"'It's like a mouse, only bigger,' her expression said.",And by this she meant that it was natural.,She accepted it as right and proper.,For Monkey got out of herself as out of a case.,"She slipped from her body as a sword slips from its sheath, yet the body went on breathing in the bed just as before; the turned-up nose with the little platform at its tip did not cease from snoring, and the lids remained fastened tightly over the brilliant brown eyes, buttoned down so securely for the night.",Two plaits of hair lay on the pillow; another rose and fell with the regular breathing of her little bosom.,But Monkey herself stood softly shining on the floor within a paw's length.,Riquette blinked her eyes and smiled complacently.,"Jimbo was close behind her, even brighter than his sister, with eyes like stars.","The visions of cats are curious things, no doubt, and few may guess their furry, silent pathways as they go winding along their length of inconsequent development.","For, softer than any mouse, the children glided swiftly into the next room where Mother slept beneath the book- shelves--two shining little radiant figures, hand in hand.","They tried for a moment to pull out Mother too, but found her difficult to move.",Somewhere on the way she stuck.,They gave it up.,"Turning towards the window that stood open beyond the head of the sofa-bed, they rose up lightly and floated through it out into the starry night.","Riquette leaped like a silent shadow after them, but before she reached the roof of red-brown tiles that sloped down to the yard, Jimbo and Monkey were already far away.","She strained her big green eyes in vain, seeing nothing but the tops of the plane trees, thick with tiny coming leaves, the sweep of vines and sky, and the tender, mothering night beyond.","She pattered softly back again, gave a contemptuous glance at Mother in passing, and jumped up at once into the warm nest of sheets that gaped invitingly between the shoulder of Jimbo's body and the pillow.","She shaped the opening to her taste, kneading it with both front paws, turned three times round, and then lay down.","Curled in a ball, her nose buried between her back feet, she was asleep in a single moment.",Her whiskers ceased to quiver.,The children were tugging at Daddy now over in the carpenter's house.,"His bed was short, and his body lay in a kind of knot.","On the chair beside it were books and papers, and a candle that had burnt itself out.","A pencil poked its nose out among the sheets, and it was clear he had fallen asleep while working.",'Wumbled!',"sighed Jimbo, pointing to the scribbled notes.","But Monkey was busy pulling him out, and did not answer.",Then Jimbo helped her.,And Daddy came out magnificently--as far as the head--then stuck like Mother.,They pulled in vain.,Something in his head prevented complete release.,'En voila un!',laughed Monkey.,'Quel homme!',"It was her natural speech, the way she talked at school.","'It's a pity,' said Jimbo with a little sigh.","They gave it up, watching him slide slowly back again.",The moment he was all in they turned towards the open window.,Hand in hand they sailed out over the sleeping village.,And from almost every house they heard a sound of weeping.,There were sighs and prayers and pleadings.,All slept and dreamed--dreamed of their difficulties and daily troubles.,"Released in sleep, their longings rose to heaven unconsciously, automatically as it were.","Even the cheerful and the happy yearned a little, even the well-to-do whom the world judged so secure--these, too, had their burdens that found release, and so perhaps relief in sleep.","'Come, and we'll help them,' Jimbo said eagerly.",'We can change all that a little.,"Oh, I say, what a lot we've got to do to-night.'","'Je crois bien,' laughed Monkey, turning somersaults for joy as she followed him.","Her tendency to somersaults in this condition was irresistible, and a source of worry to Jimbo, who classed it among the foolish habits of what he called 'womans and things like that!'","And the sound came loudest from the huddled little building by the Church, the Pension where they had their meals, and where Jinny had her bedroom.","But Jinny, they found, was already out, off upon adventures of her own.","A solitary child, she always went her independent way in everything.","They dived down into the first floor, and there, in a narrow bedroom whose windows stood open upon the wistaria branches, they found Madame Jequier--'Tante Jeanne,' as they knew the sympathetic, generous creature best, sister-in-law of the Postmaster--not sleeping like the others, but wide awake and praying vehemently in a wicker-chair that creaked with every nervous movement that she made.","All about her were bits of paper covered with figures, bills, calculations, and the rest.","'We can't get at her,' said Monkey, her laughter hushed for a moment.",'There's too much sadness.,Come on!,Let's go somewhere else.',But Jimbo held her tight.,'Let's have a try.,"Listen, you silly, can't you!'","They stood for several minutes, listening together, while the brightness of their near approach seemed to change the woman's face a little.",She looked up and listened as though aware of something near her.,"'She's praying for others as well as herself,' explained Jimbo.","'Ca vaut la peine alors,' said Monkey.",And they drew cautiously nearer....,"But, soon desisting, the children were far away, hovering about the mountains.",They had no steadiness as yet.,"'Starlight,' Jimbo was singing to himself, 'runs along my mind.'","'You're all up-jumbled,' Monkey interrupted him with a laugh, turning repeated somersaults till she looked like a catherine wheel of brightness.","'... the pattern of my verse or story...' continued Jimbo half aloud, '... a little ball of tangled glory....' 'You must unwind!'",cried Monkey.,"'Look out, it's the sun!",It'll melt us into dew!',But it was not the sun.,"Out there beyond them, towards the purple woods still sleeping, appeared a draught of starbeams like a broad, deep river of gold.","The rays, coming from all corners of the sky, wove a pattern like a network.",'Jimbo!',"gasped the girl, 'it's like a fishing-net.",We've never noticed it before.',"'It _is_ a net,' he answered, standing still as a stone, though he had not thought of it himself until she said so.","He instantly dressed himself, as he always translated _il se dressait_ in his funny Franco- English.","_Deja_ and _comme ca_, too, appeared everywhere.",'It is a net like that.,"I saw it already before, once.'","'Monkey,' he added, 'do you know what it really is?","Oh, I say!'",'Of course I do.',"She waited nevertheless for him to tell her, and he was too gallant just then in his proud excitement for personal exultation.",'It's the Star Cave--it's Daddy's Star Cave.,"He said it was up here ""where the Boudry forests dip below the cliffs towards the Areuse.""",...' He remembered the very words.,His sister forgot to turn her usual somersaults.,Wonder caught them both.,"'A pair of eyes, then, or a puddle!",Quick!',she cried in a delighted whisper.,"She looked about her everywhere at once, making confused and rushing little movements of helplessness.","'Quick, quick!'","'No,' said Jimbo, with a man's calm decision, 'it's when they _can't_ find eyes or puddles that they go in there.",Don't interfere.',She admitted her mistake.,This was no time to press a petty advantage.,"'I'll shut my eyes while you sponge up the puddles with a wedge of moss,' she began.",But her brother cut her short.,He was very sure of himself.,He was leader beyond all question.,"'You follow me,' he commanded firmly, 'and you'll get in somehow.",We'll get all sticky with it.,Then we'll come out again and help those crying people like Tante Jeanne and....' A list of names poured out.,"'They'll think us wonderful---' 'We shall be wonderful,' whispered Monkey, obeying, yet peeping with one big brown eye.",The cataract of starbeams rushed past them in a flood of gold.,They moved towards an opening in the trees where the limestone cliffs ran into rugged shapes with pinnacles and towers.,They found the entrance in the rocks.,"Water dripped over it, making little splashes.",The lime had run into hanging pillars and a fringe of pointed fingers.,Past this the river of starlight poured its brilliant golden stream.,Its soft brightness shone yellow as a shower of primrose dust.,'Look out!,The Interfering Sun!',"gasped Monkey again, awed and confused with wonder.",'We shall melt in dew or fairy cotton.,Don't you?,...,I call it rotten ...!',"'You'll unwind all right,' he told her, trying hard to keep his head and justify his leadership.","He, too, remembered phrases here and there.","'I'm a bit knotted, looped, and all up-jumbled too, inside.",But the sun is miles away still.,We're both soft-shiny still.',"They stooped to enter, plunging their bodies to the neck in the silent flood of sparkling amber.",Then happened a strange thing.,"For how could they know, these two adventurous, dreaming children, that Thought makes images which, regardless of space, may flash about the world, and reach minds anywhere that are sweetly tuned to their acceptance?",'What's that?,Look out!,_Gare!_ Hold tight!',In his sudden excitement Jimbo mixed questions with commands.,He had caught her by the hand.,"There was a new sound in the heavens above them--a roaring, rushing sound.","Like the thunder of a train, it swept headlong through the sky.",Voices were audible too.,"'There's something enormous caught in the star-net,' he whispered.","'It's Mother, then,' said Monkey.","They both looked up, trembling with anticipation.","They saw a big, dark body like a thundercloud hovering above their heads.",It had a line of brilliant eyes.,From one end issued a column of white smoke.,"It settled slowly downwards, moving softly yet with a great air of bustle and importance.","Was this the arrival of a dragon, or Mother coming after them?","The blood thumped in their ears, their hands felt icy.",The thing dipped slowly through the trees.,"It settled, stopped, began to purr.","'It's a railway train,' announced Jimbo finally with authority that only just disguised amazement.",'And the passengers are getting out.',With a sigh of immense relief he said it.,"'You're not in any danger, Monkey,' he added.","He drew his sister back quickly a dozen steps, and they hid behind a giant spruce to watch.","The scene that followed was like the holiday spectacle in a London Terminus, except that the passengers had no luggage.",The other difference was that they seemed intent upon some purpose not wholly for their own advantage.,"It seemed, too, they had expected somebody to meet them, and were accordingly rather confused and disappointed.",They looked about them anxiously.,'Last stop; all get out here!',a Guard was crying in a kind of pleasant singing voice.,'Return journey begins five minutes before the Interfering Sun has risen.',Jimbo pinched his sister's arm till she nearly screamed.,'Hear that?',he whispered.,But Monkey was too absorbed in the doings of the busy passengers to listen or reply.,For the first passenger that hurried past her was no less a person than--Jane Anne!,Her face was not puzzled now.,It was like a little sun.,"She looked utterly happy and contented, as though she had found the place and duties that belonged to her.",'Jinny!',whispered the two in chorus.,But Jane Anne did not so much as turn her head.,She slipped past them like a shaft of light.,Her hair fell loose to her waist.,She went towards the entrance.,The flood rose to her neck.,'Oh!,there she is!',cried a voice.,'She travelled with us instead of coming to meet us.',Monkey smiled.,"She knew her sister's alien, unaccountable ways only too well.","The train had settled down comfortably enough between the trees, and lay there breathing out a peaceable column of white smoke, panting a little as it did so.","The Guard went down the length of it, turning out the lamps; and from the line of open doors descended the stream of passengers, all hurrying to the entrance of the cave.","Each one stopped a moment in front of the Guard, as though to get a ticket clipped, but instead of producing a piece of pasteboard, or the Guard a punching instrument, they seemed to exchange a look together.","Each one stared into his face, nodded, and passed on.","'What blue eyes they've got,' thought Monkey to herself, as she peered into each separate face as closely as she dared.",'I wish mine were like that!',"The wind, sighing through the tree-tops, sent a shower of dew about their feet.",The children started.,'What a lovely row!',Jimbo whispered.,It was like footsteps of a multitude on the needles.,The fact that it was so clearly audible showed how softly all these passengers moved about their business.,"The Guard, they noticed then, called out the names of some of them; perhaps of all, only in the first excitement they did not catch them properly.",And each one went on at once towards the entrance of the cave and disappeared in the pouring river of gold.,"The light-footed way they moved, their swiftness as of shadows, the way they tossed their heads and flung their arms about--all this made the children think it was a dance.","Monkey felt her own legs twitch to join them, but her little brother's will restrained her.","'If you turn a somersault here,' he said solemnly, 'we're simply lost.'",He said it in French; the long word had not yet dawned upon his English consciousness.,"They watched with growing wonder then, and something like terror seized them as they saw a man go past them with a very familiar look about him.","He went in a cloud of sparkling, black dust that turned instantly into shining gold when it reached the yellow river from the stars.",His face was very dirty.,"'It's _not_ the _ramoneur_,' whispered Jimbo, uncertain whether the shiver he felt was his sister's or his own.",'He's much too springy.',Sweeps always had a limp.,"For the figure shot along with a running, dancing leap as though he moved on wires.",He carried long things over his shoulders.,He flashed into the stream like a shadow swallowed by a flame.,"And as he went, they caught such merry words, half sung, half chanted:--, 'I'll mix their smoke with hope and mystery till they see dreams and faces in their fires---' and he was gone.","Behind him came a couple arm in arm, their movements equally light and springy, but the one behind dragging a little, as though lazily.",They wore rags and torn old hats and had no collars to their shirts.,The lazy one had broken boots through which his toes showed plainly.,"The other who dragged him had a swarthy face like the gypsies who once had camped near their house in Essex long, oh, ever so long ago.","'I'll get some too,' the slow one sang huskily as he stumbled along with difficulty 'but there's never any hurry.","I'll fill their journeys with desire and make adventure call to them with love---' 'And I,' the first one answered, 'will sprinkle all their days with the sweetness of the moors and open fields, till houses choke their lungs and they come out to learn the stars by name.","Ho, ho!'","They dipped, with a flying leap, into the rushing flood.","Their rags and filthy slouched hats flashed radiant as they went, all bathed and cleaned in glory.","Others came after them in a continuous stream, some too outlandish to be named or recognised, others half familiar, very quick and earnest, but merry at the same time, and all intent upon bringing back something for the world.","It was not for themselves alone, or for their own enjoyment that they hurried in so eagerly.",'How splendid!,What a crew!',gasped Monkey.,'_Quel spectacle_!',And she began a somersault.,"'Be quiet, will you?'","was the rejoinder, as a figure who seemed to have a number of lesser faces within his own big one of sunburned brown, tumbled by them somewhat heavily and left a smell of earth and leaves and potting-sheds about the trees behind him.",'Won't my flowers just shine and dazzle 'em?,And won't the dead leaves crackle as I burn 'em up!',he chuckled as he disappeared from view.,"There was a rush of light as an eddy of the star-stream caught him, and something certainly went up in flame.",A faint odour reached the children that was like the odour of burning leaves.,"Then, with a rush, came a woman whose immensely long thin arms reached out in front of her and vanished through the entrance a whole minute before the rest of her.",But they could not see the face.,"Some one with high ringing laughter followed, though they could not see the outline at all.","It went so fast, they only heard the patter of light footsteps on the moss and needles.","Jimbo and Monkey felt slightly uncomfortable as they watched and listened, and the feeling became positive uneasiness the next minute as a sound of cries and banging reached them from the woods behind.",There was a great commotion going on somewhere in the train.,"'I can't get out, I can't get out!'",called a voice unhappily.,"'And if I do, how shall I ever get in again?",The entrance is so ridiculously small.,I shall only stick and fill it up.,Why did I ever come?,"Oh, why did I come at all?'","'Better stay where you are, lady,' the Guard was saying.",'You're good ballast.,You can keep the train down.,That's something.,"Steady thinking's always best, you know.'","Turning, the children saw a group of figures pushing and tugging at a dark mass that appeared to have stuck halfway in the carriage door.",The pressure of many willing hands gave it a different outline every minute.,It was like a thing of india-rubber or elastic.,"The roof strained outwards with ominous cracking sounds; the windows threatened to smash; the foot-board, supporting the part of her that had emerged, groaned with the weight already.","'Oh, what's the good of _me_?'",cried the queer deep voice with petulance.,"'You couldn't get a wisp of hay in there, much less all of me.",I should block the whole cave up!','Come out a bit!',a voice cried.,'I can't.','Go back then!',suggested the Guard.,'But I can't.,Besides I'm upside down!',"'You haven't got any upside down,' was the answer; 'so that's impossible.'","'Well, anyhow, I'm in a mess and muddle like this,' came the smothered voice, as the figures pulled and pushed with increasing energy.'",And my tarpaulin skirt is all askew.,The winds are at it as usual.',"'Nothing short of a gale can help you now,' was somebody's verdict, while Monkey whispered beneath her breath to Jimbo.",'She's even bigger than Mother.,Quelle masse!',Then came a thing of mystery and wonder from the sky.,"A flying figure, scattering points of light through the darkness like grains of shining sand, swooped down and stood beside the group.","'Oh, Dustman,' cried the guard, 'give her of your dust and put her to sleep, please.",She's making noise enough to bring the Interfering Sun above the horizon before his time.',Without a word the new arrival passed one hand above the part of her that presumably was the face.,Something sifted downwards.,There was a sound of gentle sprinkling through the air; a noise followed that was half a groan and half a sigh.,"Her struggles grew gradually less, then ceased.",They pushed the bulk of her backwards through the door.,Spread over many seats the Woman of the Haystack slept.,"'Thank you,' said several voices with relief.",'She'll dream she's been in.,That's just as good.',"'Every bit,' the others answered, resuming their interrupted journey towards the cavern's mouth.","'And when I come out she shall have some more,' answered the Dustman in a soft, thick voice; 'as much as ever she can use.'",He flitted in his turn towards the stream of gold.,His feet were already in it when he paused a moment to shift from one shoulder to the other a great sack he carried.,And in that moment was heard a low voice singing dreamily the Dustman's curious little song.,It seemed to come from the direction of the train where the Guard stood talking to a man the children had not noticed before.,"Presumably he was the engine-driver, since all the passengers were out now.",But it may have been the old Dustman himself who sang it.,They could not tell exactly.,"The voice made them quite drowsy as they listened:--      The busy Dustman flutters down the lanes,      He's off to gather star-dust for our dreams.","He dusts the Constellations for his sack,      Finding it thickest on the Zodiac,      But sweetest in the careless meteor's track;

yet, though they looked down upon her a little, no one in their presence could say a word against her.","For they recognised the child's unusual selflessness, and rather stood in awe of it.","And this afternoon in the woods they kept coming across places that seemed oddly familiar, although they had never visited them before.",They had one of their curious conversations about the matter--queer talks they indulged in sometimes when quite alone.,"Mother would have squelched such talk, and Daddy muddled them with long words, while Jane Anne would have looked puzzled to the point of tears.","'I'm _sure_ I've been here before,' said Monkey, looking across the trees to a place where the limestone cliffs dropped in fantastic shapes of pointed rock.",'Have you got that feeling too?',"Jimbo, with his hands in the pockets of his blue reefer overcoat and his feet stuck wide apart, stared hard at her a moment.",His little mind was searching too.,"'It's natural enough, I suppose,' he answered, too honest to pretend, too proud, though, to admit he had not got it.","They were rather breathless with their climb, and sat down on a boulder in the shade.","'I know all this awfully well,' Monkey presently resumed, looking about her.",'But certainly we've never come as far as this.,I think my underneath escapes and comes to places by itself.,I feel like that.,Does yours?',He looked up from a bundle of moss he was fingering.,This was rather beyond him.,"'Oh, I feel all right,' he said, 'just ordinary.'","He would have given his ten francs in the savings bank, the collection of a year, to have answered otherwise.","'You're always getting tummy-aches and things,' he added kindly.",'Girls do.',It was pride that made the sharp addition.,But Monkey was not hurt;

its tiny church gathers close a few brown-roofed houses; orchards guard it round about; the music of many fountains tinkle summer and winter through its cobbled yards; and its feet are washed by a tumbling stream that paints the fields with the radiance of countless wild-flowers in the spring.,But tourists never come to see them.,"There is no hotel, for one thing, and ticket agents, even at the railway stations, look puzzled a moment before they realise where this place with the twinkling name can hide....",Some consult books.,"Yet, once you get there, it is not easy to get away again.",Something catches the feet and ears and eyes.,"People have been known to go with all their luggage on Gygi's handcart to the station--then turn aside at the last moment, caught back by the purple woods.","A traveller, glancing up at the little three-storey house with 'Poste et Telegraphe' above the door, could never guess how busy the world that came and went beneath its red-tiled roof.","In spring the wistaria tree (whence the Pension borrowed its brave name, Les Glycines) hangs its blossoms between 'Poste' and 'Telegraphe,' and the perfume of invisible lilacs drenches the street from the garden at the back.","Beyond, the road dips past the bee-hives of _la cure_; and Boudry towers with his five thousand feet of blue pine woods over the horizon.",The tinkling of several big stone fountains fills the street.,"But the traveller would not linger, unless he chanced to pass at twelve o'clock and caught the stream of people going into their mid- day dinner at the Pension.","And even then he probably would not see the presiding genius, Madame Jequier, for as often as not she would be in her garden, busy with eternal bulbs, and so strangely garbed that if she showed herself at all, it would be with a shrill, plaintive explanation--'Mais il ne faut pas me regarder.",Je suis invisible!',"Whereupon, consistently, she would not speak again, but flit in silence to and fro, as though she were one of those spirits she so firmly believed in, and sometimes talked to by means of an old Planchette.","And on this particular morning the Widow Jequier was 'invisible' in her garden clothes as Gygi, the gendarme, came down the street to ring the _midi_ bell.",Her mind was black with anxiety.,"She was not thinking of the troop that came to _dejeuner_, their principal meal of the day, paying a franc for it, but rather of the violent scenes with unpaid tradesmen that had filled the morning-tradesmen who were friends as well (which made it doubly awkward) and often dropped in socially for an evening's music and conversation.","Her pain darkened the sunshine, and she found relief in the garden which was her passion.","For in three weeks the interest on the mortgages was due, and she had nothing saved to meet it.",The official notice had come that morning from the Bank.,"Her mind was black with confused pictures of bulbs, departed _pensionnaires_, hostile bankers, and--the ghastly _charite de la Commune_ which awaited her.","Yet her husband, before he went into the wine-business so disastrously, had been pasteur here.",He had preached from this very church whose bells now rang out the mid-day hour.,"The spirit of her daughter, she firmly believed, still haunted the garden, the narrow passages, and the dilapidated little salon where the ivy trailed along the ceiling.","Twelve o'clock, striking from the church-tower clock, and the voice of her sister from the kitchen window, then brought the Widow Jequier down the garden in a flying rush.",The table was laid and the soup was almost ready.,The people were coming in.,She was late as usual; there was no time to change.,"She flung her garden hat aside and scrambled into more presentable garments, while footsteps already sounded on the wooden stairs that led up from the village street.","One by one the retired governesses entered, hung their cloaks upon the pegs in the small, dark hallway, and took their places at the table.","They began talking among themselves, exchanging the little gossip of the village, speaking of their books and clothes and sewing, of the rooms in which they lived, scattered down the street, of the heating, of barking dogs that disturbed their sleep, the behaviour of the postman, the fine spring weather, and the views from their respective windows across the lake and distant Alps.","Each extolled her own position: one had a garden; another a balcony; a third was on the top floor and so had no noisy tenant overhead; a fourth was on the ground, and had no stairs to climb.","Each had her secret romance, and her secret method of cheap feeding at home.","There were five or six of them, and this was their principal meal in the day; they meant to make the most of it; they always did; they went home to light suppers of tea and coffee, made in their own _appartements_.",Invitations were issued and accepted.,There were some who would not speak to each other.,"Cliques, divisions, _societes a part_, existed in the little band.","And they talked many languages, learned in many lands--Russian, German, Italian, even Armenian--for all had laboured far from their country, spending the best of their years teaching children of foreign families, many of them in important houses.",They lived upon their savings.,"Two, at least, had less than thirty pounds a year between them and starvation, and all were of necessity careful of every centime.",They wore the same dresses from one year's end to another.,They had come home to die.,The Postmaster entered with the cash-box underneath one arm.,"He bowed gravely to the assembled ladies, and silently took his seat at the table.","He never spoke; at meals his sole remarks were statements: 'Je n'ai pas de pain,' 'Il me manque une serviette,' and the like, while his black eyes glared resentfully at every one as though they had done him an injury.",But his fierceness was only in the eyes.,He was a meek and solemn fellow really.,"Nature had dressed him in black, and he respected her taste by repeating it in his clothes.","Even his expression was funereal, though his black eyes twinkled.","The servant-girl at once brought in his plate of soup, and he tucked the napkin beneath his chin and began to eat.","From twelve to two the post was closed; his recreation time was precious, and no minute must be lost.","After dinner he took his coat off and did the heavy work of the garden, under the merciless oversight of the Widow Jequier, his sister-in-law, the cash-box ever by his side.","He chatted with his tame _corbeau_, but he never smiled.",In the winter he did fretwork.,"On the stroke of two he went downstairs again and disappeared into the cramped and stuffy bureau, whose window on the street was framed by the hanging wistaria blossoms; and at eight o'clock his day of labour ended.",He carried the cash-box up to bed at 8.15.,At 8.30 his wife followed him.,From nine to five he slept.,Alone of all the little household the Widow Jequier scorned routine.,She came and went with the uncertainty of wind.,"Her entrances and exits, too, were like the wind.","With a scattering rush she scurried through the years--noisy, ineffective, yet somewhere fine.","Her brother had finished his plate of soup, wiped his black moustaches elaborately, and turned his head towards the kitchen door with the solemn statement 'Je n'ai pas de viande,' when she descended upon the scene like a shrill-voiced little tempest.","'Bonjour Mesdames, bonjour Mademoiselle, bonjour, bonjour,' she bowed and smiled, washing her hands in the air; 'et comment allez-vous ce matin?'",as the little band of hungry governesses rose with one accord and moved to take their places.,Some smiled in answer; others merely bowed.,"She made enemies as well as friends, the Widow Jequier.",With only one of them she shook hands warmly-the one whose payments were long overdue.,But Madame Jequier never asked for her money; she knew the old body's tiny income; she would pay her when she could.,Only last week she had sent her food and clothing under the guise of a belated little Easter present.,Her heart was bigger than her body.,"'La famille Anglaise n'est pas encore ici,' announced the Postmaster as though it were a funeral to come.",He did not even look up.,His protests passed ever unobserved.,"'But I hear them coming,' said a governess, swallowing her soup with a sound of many waters.","And, true enough, they came.","There was a thunder on the stairs, the door into the hall flew open, voices and laughter filled the place, and Jimbo and Monkey raced in to take their places, breathless, rosy, voluble, and very hungry.","Jane Anne followed sedately, bowing to every one in turn.",She had a little sentence for all who cared for one.,Smiles appeared on every face.,"Mother, like a frigate coming to anchor with a favourable wind, sailed into her chair; and behind her stumbled Daddy, looking absent-minded and pre- occupied.",Money was uncommonly scarce just then--the usual Bourcelles complaint.,"Conversation in many tongues, unmusically high-pitched, then at once broke loose, led ever by _la patronne_ at the head of the table.","The big dishes of meat and vegetables were handed round; plates were piled and smothered; knives and forks were laid between mouthfuls upon plate-edges, forming a kind of frieze all round the cloth; the gossip of the village was retailed with harmless gusto.",_Dejeuner_ at Les Glycines was in full swing.,"When the apples and oranges came round, most of the governesses took two apiece, slipping one or other into little black velvet bags they carried on their laps below the table.","Some, it was whispered, put bread there too to keep them company.",But this was probably a libel.,"Madame Jequier, at any rate, never saw it done.",She looked the other way.,"'We all must live,' was her invariable answer to such foolish stories.",'One cannot sleep if one's supper is too light.',"Like her body, her soul was a bit untidy--careless, that is, with loose ends.","Who would have guessed, for instance, the anxiety that just now gnawed her very entrails?","She was a mixture of shameless egotism, and of burning zeal for others.",There was a touch of grandeur in her.,"At the end of the table, just where the ivy leaves dropped rather low from their trailing journey across the ceiling, sat Miss Waghorn, her vigorous old face wrapped, apparently, in many apple skins.","She was well past seventy, thin, erect, and active, with restless eyes, and hooked nose, the poor old hands knotted with rheumatism, yet the voice somehow retaining the energy of forty.","Her manners were charming and old-fashioned, and she came of Quaker stock.","Seven years before she arrived at the Pension for the summer, and had forgotten to leave.",For she forgot most things within ten minutes of their happening.,"Her memory was gone; she remembered a face, as most other things as well, about twenty minutes; introductions had to be repeated every day, and sometimes at supper she would say with her gentle smile, 'We haven't met before, I think,' to some one she had held daily intercourse with for many months.","'I was born in '37,' she loved to add, 'the year of Queen Victoria's accession'; and five minutes later you might hear her ask, 'Now, guess how old I am; I don't mind a bit.'",She was as proud of her load of years as an old gentleman of his thick hair.,'Say exactly what you think.,"And don't guess too low, mind.'",Her numerous stories were self-repeaters.,"Miss Waghorn's memory was a source of worry and anxiety to all except the children, who mercilessly teased her.","She loved the teasing, though but half aware of it.","It was their evil game to extract as many of her familiar stories as possible, one after another.",They knew all the clues.,"There was the Cornishman--she came from Cornwall--who had seen a fairy; his adventure never failed to thrill them, though she used the same words every time and they knew precisely what was coming.","She was particularly strong on family reminiscences:--her father was bald at thirty, her brother's beard was so long that he tied it round his neck when playing cricket; her sister 'had the shortest arms you ever saw.'","Always of youth she spoke; it was pathetic, so determined was she to be young at seventy.",Her family seemed distinguished in this matter of extremes.,But the superiority of Cornish over Devonshire cream was her _piece de resistance_.,"Monkey need merely whisper--Miss Waghorn's acuteness of hearing was positively uncanny--'Devonshire cream is what _I_ like,' to produce a spurt of explanation and defence that lasted a good ten minutes and must be listened to until the bitter end.","Jimbo would gravely inquire in a pause--of a stranger, if possible, if not, of the table in general-- 'Have you ever seen a fairy?'","'No, but I've eaten Cornish cream--it's poison, you know,' Monkey would reply.","And up would shoot the keen old face, preened for the fray.","'We haven't been introduced, I think'--forgetting the formal introduction of ten minutes ago--'but I overheard, if you'll forgive my interrupting, and I can tell you all about Cornish cream.",I was born in '37'--with her eager smile--'and for years it was on our table.,I have made quantities of it.,"The art was brought first by the Phoenicians----' 'Venetians,' said Monkey.","'No, Phoenicians, dear, when they came to Cornwall for tin----' 'To put the cream in,' from the same source.","'No, you silly child, to get tin from the mines, of course, and----' Then Mother or Daddy, noting the drift of things, would interfere, and the youngsters would be obliterated--until next time.","Miss Waghorn would finish her recital for the hundredth time, firmly believing it to be the first.","She was a favourite with everybody, in spite of the anxiety she caused.","She would go into town to pay her bill at the bootmaker's, and order another pair of boots instead, forgetting why she came.",Her income was sixty pounds a year.,"She forgot in the afternoon the money she had received in the morning, till at last the Widow Jequier seized it for her the moment it arrived.","And at night she would doze in her chair over the paper novel she had been ""at"" for a year and more, beginning it every night afresh, and rarely getting beyond the opening chapter.",For it was ever new.,"All were anxious, though, what she would do next.",She was so full of battle.,"Everybody talked at once, but forced conversation did not flourish.",Bourcelles was not fashionable; no one ever had appendicitis there.,"Yet ailments of a milder order were the staple, inexhaustible subjects at meals.","Instead of the weather, _mon estomac_ was the inexhaustible tale.","The girl brought in the little Cantonal newspaper, and the widow read out selections in a high, shrill voice, regardless who listened.",Misfortunes and accidents were her preference.,_Grand ciel_ and _quelle horreur_ punctuated the selections.,"'There's Tante Jeanne grand-cieling as usual,' Mother would say to her husband, who, being a little deaf, would answer, 'What?'","and Tante Jeanne, overhearing him, would re-read the accident for his especial benefit, while the governesses recounted personal experiences among themselves, and Miss Waghorn made eager efforts to take part in it all, or tell her little tales of fairies and Cornish cream.... One by one the governesses rose to leave; each made a comprehensive bow that included the entire company.","Daddy lit a cigarette or let Jimbo light it for him, too wumbled with his thoughts of afternoon work to notice the puff stolen surreptitiously on the way.","Jane Anne folded her napkin carefully, talking with Mother in a low voice about the packing of the basket with provisions for tea.","Tea was included in the Pension terms; in a small clothes-basket she carried bread, milk, sugar, and butter daily across to La Citadelle, except on Sundays when she wore gloves and left the duty to the younger children who were less particular.","The governesses, charged with life for another twenty-four hours at least, flocked down the creaking stairs.","They nodded as they passed the Bureau window where the Postmaster pored over his collection of stamps, or examined a fretwork pattern of a boy on a bicycle--there was no heavy garden work that day--and went out into the street.","They stood in knots a moment, discussing unfavourably the food just eaten, and declaring they would stand it no longer.",'Only where else can we go?',"said one, feeling automatically at her velvet bag to make sure the orange was safely in it.","Upstairs, at the open window, Madame Jequier overheard them as she filled the walnut shells with butter for the birds.",She only smiled.,"'I wish we could help her,' Mother was saying to her husband, as they watched her from the sofa in the room behind.",'A more generous creature never lived.',"It was a daily statement that lacked force owing to repetition, yet the emotion prompting it was ever new and real.","'Or a more feckless,' was his reply.","'But if we ever come into our estates, we will.",It shall be the first thing.',"His mind always hovered after those distant estates when it was perplexed by immediate financial difficulty, and just now he was thinking of various bills and payments falling due.","It was his own sympathetic link with the widow--ways and means, and the remorseless nature of sheets of paper with columns of figures underneath the horrible word _doit._ 'So Monsieur 'Enry Rogairs is coming,' she said excitedly, turning to them a moment on her way to the garden.",'And after all these years!,"He will find the house the same, and the garden better--oh, wonderfully improved.","But us, _helas!_ he will find old, oh, how old!'","She did not really mean herself, however.","She began a long 'reminiscent' chapter, full of details of the days when he and Daddy had been boys together, but in the middle of it Daddy just got up and walked out, saying, 'I must get over to my work, you know.'",There was no artificiality of manners at Bourcelles.,"Mother followed him, with a trifle more ceremony.","'Ah, c'est partir a l'anglaise!'","sighed the widow, watching them go.",She was accustomed to it.,"She went out into her garden, full of excitement at the prospect of the new arrival.",Every arrival for her meant a possible chance of help.,She was as young as her latest bulb really.,"Courage, hope, and generosity invariably go together.","CHAPTER XI       Take him and cut him out in little stars,       And he will make the face of heaven so fine       That all the world will be in love with night       And pay no worship to the garish sun!",Romeo and Juliet.,"The announcement of Henry Rogers's coming was received--variously, for any new arrival into the Den circle was subjected to rigorous criticism.","This criticism was not intentional; it was the instinctive judgment that children pass upon everything, object or person, likely to affect themselves.",And there is no severer bar of judgment in the world.,'Who _is_ Cousinenry?,What a name!,"Is he stiff, I wonder?'","came from Monkey, almost before the announcement had left her father's lips.",'What will he think of Tante Jeanne?',"Her little torrent of questions that prejudged him thus never called for accurate answers as a rule, but this time she meant to have an answer.",'What is he exaccurately?',"she added, using her own invention made up of 'exact' and 'accurate.'","Mother looked up from the typewritten letter to reply, but before she could say, 'He's your father's cousin, dear; they were here as boys twenty years ago to learn French,' Jinny burst in with an explosive interrogation.",She had been reading _La Bonne Menagere_ in a corner.,"Her eyes, dark with conjecture, searched the faces of both parents alternately.","'Excuse me, Mother, but is he a clergyman?'",she asked with a touch of alarm.,"'Whatever makes you think that, child?'",'Clergymen are always called the reverundhenry.,He'll wear black and have socks that want mending.',"'He shouldn't punt his letters,' declared Monkey.","'He's not an author, is he?'","Jimbo, busy over school tasks, with a huge slate-pencil his crumpled fingers held like a walking-stick, watched and listened in silence.","He was ever fearful, perhaps, lest his superior man's knowledge might be called upon and found wanting.","Questions poured and crackled like grapeshot, while the truth slowly emerged from the explanations the parents were occasionally permitted to interject.",The personality of Cousin Henry Rogers grew into life about them--gradually.,The result was a curious one that Minks would certainly have resented with indignation.,"For Cousinenry was, apparently, a business man with pockets full of sovereigns; stern, clever, and important; the sort of man that gets into Governments and things, yet somewhere with the flavour of the clergyman about him.",This clerical touch was Jane Anne's contribution to the picture; and she was certain that he wore silk socks of the most expensive description--a detail she had read probably in some chance fragments of a newspaper.,"For Jinny selected phrases in this way from anywhere, and repeated them on all occasions without the slightest relevancy.",She practised them.,She had a way of giving abrupt information and making startling statements _a propos_ of nothing at all.,"Certain phrases stuck in her mind, it seemed, for no comprehensible reason.","When excited she picked out the one that first presented itself and fired it off like a gun, the more inapt the better.",And 'busy' was her favourite adjective always.,"'It's like a communication from a company,' Mother was saying, as she handed back the typewritten letter.",'Is he a company promoter then?',"asked Jinny like a flash, certainly ignorant what that article of modern life could mean.","'Oh, I say!'","came reproachfully from Jimbo, thus committing himself for the first time to speech.","He glanced up into several faces round him, and then continued the picture of Cousin Henry he was drawing on his slate.",He listened all the time.,Occasionally he cocked an eye or ear up.,"He took in everything, saying little.",His opinions matured slowly.,"The talk continued for a long time, questions and answers.","'I think he's nice,' he announced at length in French.","For intimate things, he always used that language; his English, being uncertain, was kept for matters of unimportance.",'A gentle man.',And it was Jimbo's verdict that the children then finally adopted.,"Cousin Henry was _gentil._ They laughed loudly at him, yet agreed.","His influence on their little conclaves, though never volubly expressed-- because of that very fact, perhaps--was usually accepted.",Jimbo was so decided.,And he never committed himself to impulsive judgments that later had to be revised.,"He listened in silence to the end, then went plump for one side or the other.","'I think he'll be a nice man,' was the label, therefore, then and there attached to Mr. Henry Rogers in advance of delivery.","Further than that, however, they would not go.",It would have been childish to commit themselves more deeply till they saw him.,"The conversation then slipped beyond their comprehension, or rather their parents used long words and circumventing phrases that made it difficult to follow.","Owing to lack of space, matters of importance often had to be discussed in this way under the children's eyes, unless at night, when all were safe in bed; for French, of course, was of no avail for purposes of concealment.","Long words were then made use of, dark, wumbled sentences spoken very quickly, with suggestive gestures and expressions of the eyes labelled by Monkey with, 'Look, Mother and Daddy are making faces--something's up!'","But, none the less, all listened, and Monkey, whose intuitive intelligence soaked up hidden meanings like a sponge, certainly caught the trend of what was said.","She detailed it later to the others, when Jinny checked her exposition with a puzzled 'but Mother could never have said _that_,' while Jimbo looked wise and grave, as though he had understood it all along, and was even in his parents' councils.","On this occasion, however, there was nothing very vital to retail.",Cousin Henry was to arrive to-morrow by the express from Paris.,"He was a little younger than Daddy, and would have the room above him in the carpenter's house.","His meals he would take at the Pension just as they did, and for tea he would always come over to the Den.","And this latter fact implied that he was to be admitted into intimacy at once, for only intimates used the Den regularly for tea, of course.",It was serious.,It involved a change in all their lives.,"Jinny wondered if it 'would cost Daddy any more money,' or whether 'Cousinenry would bring a lot of things with him,' though not explaining whether by 'things' she meant food or presents or clothes.","He was not married, so he couldn't be very old; and Monkey, suggesting that he might 'get to love' one of the retired governesses who came to the Pension for their mid-day dinner, was squelched by Jimbo with 'old governesses _never_ marry; they come back to settle, and then they just die off.'",Thus was Henry Rogers predigested.,But at any rate he was accepted.,"And this was fortunate; for a new arrival whom the children did not 'pass' had been known to have a time that may best be described as not conducive to repose of body, mind, or spirit.","The arrival of Mr. Henry Rogers in the village--in La Citadelle, that is--was a red-letter day.","This, however, seems a thin description of its glory.","For a more adequate description a well-worn phrase must be borrowed from the poems of Montmorency Minks--a 'Day of Festival,' for which 'coronal' invariably lay in waiting for rhyming purposes a little further down the sonnet.","Monkey that afternoon managed to get home earlier than usual from Neuchatel, a somewhat suspicious explanation as her passport.",Her eyes were popping.,Jimbo was always out of the village school at three.,"He carried a time-table in his pocket; but it was mere pretence, since he was a little walking Bradshaw, and knew every train by heart--the Geneva Express, the Paris Rapide, the 'omnibus' trains, and the mountain ones that climbed the forest heights towards La Chaux de Fonds and Le Locle.","Of these latter only the white puffing smoke was visible from the village, but he knew with accuracy their times of departure, their arrival, and the names of every station where they stopped.","In the omnibus trains he even knew some of the guards personally, the engine-drivers too.","He might be seen any day after school standing in the field beside the station, waiting for them to pass; _mecanicien_ and _conducteur_ were the commonest words in his whole vocabulary.","When possible he passed the time of day with both of these important personages, or from the field he waved his hand and took his cap off.","All engines, moreover, were 'powerful locomotives.'","The phrase was stolen from his father--a magnificent sound it had, taking several seconds to pronounce.","No day was wholly lived in vain which enabled him to turn to some one with, 'There's the Paris Rapide; it's five minutes late'; or 'That's the Geneva omnibus.","You see, it has to have a very'--here a deep breath--'powerful locomotive.'","So upon this day of festival it was quite useless to talk of common things, and even the holidays acquired a very remote importance.",Everybody in the village knew it.,"From Gygi, the solitary gendarme, to Henri Beguin, who mended boots, but had the greater distinction that he was the only man Gygi ever arrested, for periodical wild behaviour --all knew that 'Cousin Henry, father's cousin, you know,' was expected to arrive in the evening, that he was an important person in the life of London, and that he was not exactly a _pasteur_, yet shared something of a clergyman's grave splendour.","Clothed in a sacerdotal atmosphere he certainly was, though it was the gravity of Jane Anne's negative description that fastened this wild ecclesiastical idea upon him.","'He's not _exactly_ a clergyman,' she told the dressmaker, who for two francs every Monday afternoon sat in the kitchen and helped with the pile of indiscriminate mending,' because he has to do with rather big companies and things.",But he is a serious man all the same--and most fearfully busy always.',"'We're going to meet him in the town,' said Jimbo carelessly.","'You see, the Paris Rapide doesn't stop here.",We shall come back with him by the 6.20.,"It gets here at 6.50, so he'll be in time for supper, if it's punctual.",It usually is.',And accordingly they went to Neuchatel and met the Paris train.,"They met their Cousin Henry, too.","Powerful locomotives and everything else were instantly forgotten when they saw their father go up to a tall thin man who jumped--yes, jumped--down the high steps on to the level platform and at once began to laugh.",He had a beard like their father.,'How _will_ they know which is which?',thought Jinny.,They stood in everybody's way and stared.,He was so tall.,Daddy looked no bigger than little Beguin beside him.,"He had a large, hooked nose, brown skin, and keen blue eyes that took in everything at a single glance.",They twinkled absurdly for so big a man.,He wore rough brown tweeds and a soft felt travelling hat.,He wore also square-toed English boots.,He carried in one hand a shiny brown leather bag with his initials on it like a member of the Government.,"The clergyman idea was destroyed in a fraction of a second, never to revive.",The company promoter followed suit.,Jinny experienced an entirely new sensation in her life--something none but herself had ever felt before--something romantic.,"'He's like a soldier--a General,' she said to anybody who cared to listen, and she said it so loudly that many did listen.",But she did not care.,"She stood apart from the others, staring as though it were a railway accident.",This tall figure of a cousin she could fit nowhere as yet into her limited scheme of life.,She admired him intensely.,Yet Daddy laughed and chatted with him as if he were nothing at all!,"She kept outside the circle, wondering about his socks and underclothes.",His beard was much neater and better trimmed than her father's.,At least no crumb or bit of cotton was in it.,But Jimbo felt no awe.,"After a moment's hesitation, during which the passers-by butted him this way and that, he marched straight up and looked him in the face.",He reached to his watch-chain only.,"'I'll be your sekrity, too,' he announced, interrupting Daddy's foolishness about 'this is my youngest lad, Rogers.'",Youngest lad indeed!,And Henry Rogers then stooped and kissed the lot of them.,One after the other he put his big arms round them and gave them a hug that was like the hug of a bear standing on its hind legs.,"They took it, each in his own way, differently.","Jimbo proudly; Monkey, with a smacking return kiss that somehow conveyed the note of her personality-- impudence; but Jane Anne, with a grave and outraged dignity, as though in a public railway station this kind of behaviour was slightly inappropriate.",She wondered for days afterwards whether she had been quite correct.,"He was a cousin, but still he was--a man.",And she wondered what she ought to call him.,'Mr.,"Rogers' was not quite right, yet 'Mr.",Cousin Henry' was equally ill-chosen.,"She decided upon a combination of her own, a kind of code-word that was affectionate yet distant: 'Cousinenry.'",And she used it with an explosive directness that was almost challenge--he could accept which half he chose.,But all accepted him at once without fear.,"They felt, moreover, a secret and very tender thing; there was something in this big, important man that made them know he would love them for themselves; and more--that something in him had need of them.",Here lay the explanation of their instant confidence and acceptance.,"'What a jolly bunch you are, to be sure!'",he exclaimed.,"'And you're to be my secretary, are you?'","he added, taking Jimbo by the shoulders.",'How splendid!',"'_I'm_ not,' said Monkey, with a rush of laughter already too long restrained.","Her manner suggested a somersault, only prevented by engines and officials.",But Jimbo was a little shocked.,This sort of thing disgraced them.,"'Oh, I say!'",he exclaimed reproachfully.,"'Daddy, isn't she awful?'","added Jane Anne under her breath, a sentence of disapproval in daily use.",Her life seemed made up of apologising for her impudent sister.,"'The 6.20 starts at 6.20, you know,' Jimbo announced.",'The Lausanne Express has gone.,"Are your ""baggages"" registered?'",And the party moved off in a scattered and uncertain manner to buy tickets and register the luggage.,They went back second class--for the first time in their lives.,It was Cousin Henry who paid the difference.,That sealed his position finally in their eyes.,He was a millionaire.,All London people went first or second class.,But Jimbo and his younger sister had noticed something else about the new arrival besides his nose and eyes and length.,Even his luxurious habit of travelling second class did not impress them half as much as this other detail in his appearance.,They referred to it in a whispered talk behind the shelter of the _conducteur's_ back while tickets were being punched.,"'You know,' whispered Monkey, her eyes popping, 'I've seen Cousin Henry before somewhere.",I'm certain.',She gave a little gasp.,"Jimbo stared, only half believing, yet undeniably moved.","Even his friend, the Guard, was temporarily neglected.",'Where?',he asked; 'do you mean in a picture?',"'No,' she answered with decision, 'out here, I think.",In the woods or somewhere.',She seemed vague.,But her very vagueness helped him to believe.,She was not inventing; he was sure of that.,"The _conducteur_ at that moment passed away along the train, and Cousin Henry looked straight at the pair of them.",Through the open window dusk fluttered down the sky with spots of gold already on its wings.,"'What jolly stars you've got here,' he said, pointing.",'They're like diamonds.,"Look, it's a perfect network far above the Alps.",By gum-- what beauties!',And as he said it he smiled.,Monkey gave her brother a nudge that nearly made him cry out.,"He wondered what she meant, but all the same he returned the nudge significantly.","For Cousin Henry, when he smiled, had plainly shown--two teeth of gold.",The children had never seen gold-capped teeth.,"'I'd like one for my collection,' thought Jimbo, meaning a drawer that included all his loose possessions of small size.","But another thing stirred in him too, vague, indefinite, far away, something he had, as it were, forgotten.","CHAPTER XII      O star benignant and serene,        I take the good to-morrow,      That fills from verge to verge my dream,        With all its joy and sorrow!","The old sweet spell is unforgot        That turns to June December;

She lies just now within the fringe of an enormous shadow, for the sun has dipped behind the blue-domed mountains that keep back France.","Small hands of scattered mist creep from the forest, fingering the vineyards that troop down towards the lake.",A dog barks.,"Gygi, the gendarme, leaves the fields and goes home to take his uniform from its peg.",Pere Langel walks among his beehives.,"There is a distant tinkling of cow-bells from the heights, where isolated pastures gleam like a patchwork quilt between the spread of forest; and farther down a train from Paris or Geneva, booming softly, leaves a trail of smoke against the background of the Alps where still the sunshine lingers.","But trains, somehow, do not touch the village; they merely pass it.","Busy with vines, washed by its hill-fed stream, swept by the mountain winds, it lies unchallenged by the noisy world, remote, un-noticed, half forgotten.","And on its outskirts stands the giant poplar that guards it--_la sentinelle_ the peasants call it, because its lofty crest, rising to every wind, sends down the street first warning of any coming change.",They see it bend or hear the rattle of its leaves.,"The _coup de Joran_, most sudden and devastating of mountain winds, is on the way from the precipice of the Creux du Van.",It comes howling like artillery down the deep Gorges de l'Areuse.,"They run to fasten windows, collect the washing from roof and garden, drive the cattle into shelter, and close the big doors of the barns.","The children clap their hands and cry to Gygi, 'Plus vite!",Plus vite!',The lake turns dark.,Ten minutes later it is raging with an army of white horses like the sea.,Darkness drapes the village.,"It comes from the whole long line of Jura, riding its troop of purple shadows--slowly curtaining out the world.","For the carpenter's house stands by itself, apart.","Perched upon a knoll beside his little patch of vineyard, it commands perspective.","From his upper window Rogers saw and remembered.... High up against the fading sky ridges of limestone cliff shine out here and there, and upon the vast slopes of Boudry--_l'immense geant de Boudry_--lies a flung cloak of forest that knows no single seam.","The smoke from _bucheron_ fires, joining the scarves of mist, weaves across its shoulder a veil of lace-like pattern, and at its feet, like some great fastening button, hides the village of the same name, where Marat passed his brooding youth.",Its evening lights are already twinkling.,"They signal across the vines to the towers of Colombier, rising with its columns of smoke and its poplars against the sheet of darkening water--Colombier, in whose castle _milord marechal Keith_ had his headquarters as Governor of the Principality of Neuchatel under the King of Prussia.","And, higher up, upon the flank of wooded mountains, is just visible still the great red-roofed farm of Cotendard, built by his friend Lord Wemyss, another Jacobite refugee, who had strange parties there and entertained Jean Jacques Rousseau in his exile.","La Citadelle in the village was the wing of another castle he began to build, but left unfinished.","White in the gathering dusk, Rogers saw the strip of roadway where passed the gorgeous coach--_cette fameuse diligence du milord marshal Keith_--or more recent, but grimmer memory, where General Bourbaki's division of the French army, 80,000 strong, trailed in unspeakable anguish, hurrying from the Prussians.","At Les Verrieres, upon the frontier, they laid down their arms, and for three consecutive days and nights the pitiful destitute procession passed down that strip of mountain road in the terrible winter of 1870-71.","Some among the peasants still hear that awful tramping in their sleep: the kindly old _vigneron_ who stood in front of his chalet from dawn to sunset, giving each man bread and wine; and the woman who nursed three soldiers through black small-pox, while neighbours left food upon the wall before the house.... Memories of his boyhood crowded thick and fast.",The spell of the place deepened about him with the darkness.,"He recalled the village postman--fragment of another romance, though a tattered and discredited one.","For this postman was the descendant of that audacious pale-frenier who married Lord Wemyss' daughter, to live the life of peasants with her in a yet tinier hamlet higher up the slopes.","If you asked him, he would proudly tell you, with his bullet-shaped, close-cropped head cocked impertinently on one side, how his brother, now assistant in a Paris shop, still owned the title of baron by means of which his reconciliated lordship sought eventually to cover up the unfortunate escapade.",He would hand you English letters--and Scotch ones too!--with an air of covert insolence that was the joy of half the village.,"And on Sundays he was to be seen, garbed in knickerbockers, gaudy stockings, and sometimes high, yellowish spats, walking with his peasant girl along the very road his more spirited forbear covered in his runaway match....",The night stepped down more quickly every minute from the heights.,"Deep-noted bells floated upwards to him from Colombier, bringing upon the evening wind some fragrance of these faded boyhood memories.","The stars began to peep above the peaks and ridges, and the mountains of the Past moved nearer.","A veil of gossamer rose above the tree-tops, hiding more and more of the landscape; he just could see the slim new moon dip down to drink from her own silver cup within the darkening lake.","Workmen, in twos and threes, came past the little house from their toil among the vines, and fragments of the Dalcroze songs rose to his ear--songs that the children loved, and that he had not heard for nearly a quarter of a century.","Their haunting refrains completed then the spell, for all genuine spells are set to some peculiar music of their own.",These Dalcroze melodies were exactly right....,The figures melted away into the single shadow of the village street.,"The houses swallowed them, voices, footsteps, and all.","And his eye, wandering down among the lights that twinkled against the wall of mountains, picked out the little ancient house, nestling so close beside the church that they shared a wall in common.",Twenty-five years had passed since first he bowed his head beneath the wistaria that still crowned the Pension doorway.,He remembered bounding up the creaking stairs.,"He felt he could still bound as swiftly and with as sure a step, only--he would expect less at the top now.","More truly put, perhaps, he would expect less for himself.",That ambition of his life was over and done with.,It was for others now that his desires flowed so strongly.,"Mere personal aims lay behind him in a faded heap, their seductiveness exhausted....",He was a man with a Big Scheme now-- a Scheme to help the world....,"The village seemed a dull enough place in those days, for the big Alps beckoned beyond, and day and night he longed to climb them instead of reading dull French grammar.",But now all was different.,It dislocated his sense of time to find the place so curiously unchanged.,The years had played some trick upon him.,"While he himself had altered, developed, and the rest, this village had remained identically the same, till it seemed as if no progress of the outer world need ever change it.","The very people were so little altered--hair grown a little whiter, shoulders more rounded, steps here and there a trifle slower, but one and all following the old routine he knew so well as a boy.","Tante Jeanne, in particular, but for wrinkles that looked as though a night of good sound sleep would smooth them all away, was the same brave woman, still 'running' that Wistaria Pension against the burden of inherited debts and mortgages.","'We're still alive,' she had said to him, after greetings delayed a quarter of a century, 'and if we haven't got ahead much, at least we haven't gone back!'",There was no more hint of complaint than this.,It stirred in him a very poignant sense of admiration for the high courage that drove the ageing fighter forward still with hope and faith.,"No doubt she still turned the kitchen saucer that did duty for planchette, unconsciously pushing its blunted pencil towards the letters that should spell out coming help.","No doubt she still wore that marvellous tea-gown garment that did duty for so many different toilettes, even wearing it when she went with goloshes and umbrella to practise Sunday's hymns every Saturday night on the wheezy church harmonium.","And most likely she still made underskirts from the silk of discarded umbrellas because she loved the sound of frou-frou thus obtained, while the shape of the silk exactly adapted itself to the garment mentioned.","And doubtless, too, she still gave away a whole week's profits at the slightest call of sickness in the village, and then wondered how it was the Pension did not pay...!",A voice from below interrupted his long reverie.,"'Ready for supper, Henry?'",cried his cousin up the stairs.,'It's past seven.,The children have already left the Citadelle.',"And as the two middle-aged dreamers made their way along the winding street of darkness through the vines, one of them noticed that the stars drew down their grand old network, fastening it to the heights of Boudry and La Tourne.","He did not mention it to his companion, who was wumbling away in his beard about some difficult details of his book, but the thought slipped through his mind like the trail of a flying comet: 'I'd like to stay a long time in this village and get the people straight a bit,'--which, had he known it, was another thought carefully paraphrased so that he should not notice it and feel alarm: 'It will be difficult to get away from here.",My feet are in that net of stars.,It's catching about my heart.',"Low in the sky a pale, witched moon of yellow watched them go.... 'The Starlight Express is making this way, I do believe,' he thought.",But perhaps he spoke the words aloud instead of thinking them.,'Eh!,"What's that you said, Henry?'","asked the other, taking it for a comment of value upon the plot of a story he had referred to.","'Oh, nothing particular,' was the reply.",'But just look at those stars above La Tourne.,They shine like beacons burning on the trees.',Minks would have called them 'braziers.',"'They are rather bright, yes,' said the other, disappointed.",'The air here is so very clear.',And they went up the creaking wooden stairs to supper in the Wistaria Pension as naturally as though the years had lifted them behind the mountains of the past in a single bound-- twenty-five years ago.,"CHAPTER XIII     Near where yonder evening star       Makes a glory in the air,     Lies a land dream--found and far       Where it is light always.","There those lovely ghosts repair       Who in sleep's enchantment are,     In Cockayne dwell all things fair--       (But it is far away).","Cockayne Country, Agnes Duclaux.","The first stage in Cousinenry's introduction took place, as has been seen, at a railway station; but further stages were accomplished later.","For real introductions are not completed by merely repeating names and shaking hands, still less by a hurried kiss.","The ceremony had many branches too--departments, as it were.","It spread itself, with various degrees, over many days as opportunity offered, and included Gygi, the gendarme, as well as the little troop of retired governesses who came to the Pension for their mid-day dinner.",Before two days were passed he could not go down the village street without lifting his cap at least a dozen times.,"Bourcelles was so very friendly; no room for strangers there; a new-comer might remain a mystery, but he could not be unknown.",Rogers found his halting French becoming rapidly fluent again.,And every one knew so much about him--more almost than he knew himself.,"At the Den next day, on the occasion of their first tea together, he realised fully that introduction--to the children at any rate-- involved a kind of initiation.","It seemed to him that the room was full of children, crowds of them, an intricate and ever shifting maze.","For years he had known no dealings with the breed, and their movements now were so light and rapid that it rather bewildered him.","They were in and out between the kitchen, corridor, and bedroom like bits of a fluid puzzle.","One moment a child was beside him, and the next, just as he had a suitable sentence ready to discharge at it, the place was vacant.","A minute later 'it' appeared through another door, carrying the samovar, or was on the roof outside struggling with Riquette.","'Oh, there you are!'",he exclaimed.,"'How you do dart about, to be sure!'","And the answer, if any, was invariably of the cheeky order-- 'One can't keep still here; there's not room enough.'","Or, worse still-- 'I must get past you somehow!'","This, needless to say, from Monkey, who first made sure her parents were out of earshot.","But he liked it, for he recognised this proof that he was accepted and made one of the circle.",These were tentative invitations to play.,"It made him feel quite larky, though at first he found his machinery of larking rather stiff.",The wheels required oiling.,And his first attempt to chase Miss Impudence resulted in a collision with Jane Anne carrying a great brown pot of home-made jam for the table.,There was a dreadful sound.,He had stepped on the cat at the same time.,"His introduction to the cat was the immediate result, performed solemnly by Jimbo, and watched by Jinny, still balancing the jar of jam, with an expression of countenance that was half amazement and half shock.",Collisions with creatures of his size and splendour were a new event to her.,'I must advertise for help if it occurs again!',she exclaimed.,"'That's Mere Riquette, you know,' announced Jimbo formally to his cousin, standing between them in his village school blouse, hands tucked into his belt.","'I heard her, yes.'","From a distance the cat favoured him with a single comprehensive glance, then turned away and disappeared beneath the sofa.","She, of course, reserved her opinion.",'It didn't REALLY hurt her.,She always squeals like that.',"'Perhaps she likes it,' suggested Rogers.","'She likes better tickling behind the ear,' Jimbo thought, anxious to make him feel all right, and then plunged into a description of her general habits--how she jumped at the door handles when she wanted to come in, slept on his bed at night, and looked for a saucer in a particular corner of the kitchen floor.",This last detail was a compliment.,"He meant to imply that Cousin Henry might like to see to it himself sometimes, although it had always been his own special prerogative hitherto.","'I shall know in future, then,' said Rogers earnestly, showing, by taking the information seriously, that he possessed the correct instinct.","'Oh yes, it's quite easy.","You'll soon learn it,' spoken with feet wide apart and an expression of careless importance, as who should say, 'What a sensible man you are!","Still, these _are_ little things one has to be careful about, you know.'","Mother poured out tea, somewhat laboriously, as though the exact proportions of milk, hot water, and sugar each child took were difficult to remember.","Each had a special cup, moreover.","Her mind, ever crammed with a thousand domestic details which she seemed to carry all at once upon the surface, ready for any sudden question, found it difficult to concentrate upon the teapot.",Her mind was ever worrying over these.,Her husband was too vague to be of practical help.,"When any one spoke to her, she would pause in the middle of the operation, balancing a cup in one hand and a milk jug in the other, until the question was properly answered, every t crossed and every i dotted.",There was no mistaking what Mother meant--provided you had the time to listen.,She had that careful thoroughness which was no friend of speed.,The result was that hands were stretched out for second cups long before she had completed the first round.,"Her own tea began usually when everybody else had finished--and lasted--well, some time.","'Here's a letter I got,' announced Jimbo, pulling a very dirty scrap of paper from a pocket hidden beneath many folds of blouse.",'You'd like to see it.',"He handed it across the round table, and Rogers took it politely.","'Thank you very much; it came by this morning's post, did it?'","'Oh, no,' was the reply, as though a big correspondence made the date of little importance.",'Not by _that_ post.',"But Monkey blurted out with the jolly laughter that was her characteristic sound, 'It came ages ago.",He's had it in his pocket for weeks.',"Jimbo, ignoring the foolish interruption, watched his cousin's face, while Jinny gave her sister a secret nudge that every one could see.","'Darling Jimbo,' was what Rogers read, 'I have been to school, and did strokes and prickings and marched round.",I am like you now.,"A fat kiss and a hug, your loving---' The signature was illegible, lost amid several scratchy lines in a blot that looked as if a beetle had expired after violent efforts in a pool of ink.","'Very nice indeed, very well put,' said Rogers, handing it gravely back again, while some one explained that the writer, aged five, had just gone to a kindergarten school in Geneva.",'And have you answered it?',"'Oh, yes.","I answered it the same day, you see.'","It was, perhaps, a foolish letter for a man to have in his pocket.",Still--it was a letter.,'Good!,What a capital secretary you'll make me.',And the boy's flush of pleasure almost made the dish of butter rosy.,"'Oh, take another; take a lot, please,' Jimbo said, handing the cakes that Rogers divined were a special purchase in his honour; and while he did so, managed to slip one later on to the plates of Monkey and her sister, who sat on either side of him.","The former gobbled it up at once, barely keeping back her laughter, but Jinny, with a little bow, put hers carefully aside on the edge of her plate, not knowing quite the 'nice' thing to do with it.",Something in the transaction seemed a trifle too familiar perhaps.,"She stole a glance at mother, but mother was filling the cups and did not notice.","Daddy could have helped her, only he would say 'What?'","in a loud voice, and she would have to repeat her question for all to hear.","Later, she ate the cake in very small morsels, a little uncomfortably.","It was a jolly, merry, cosy tea, as teas in the Den always were.",Daddy wumbled a number of things in his beard to which no one need reply unless they felt like it.,"The usual sentences were not heard to-day: 'Monkey, what a mouthful!",You _must_ not shovel in your food like that!',"or, 'Don't _gurgle_ your tea down; swallow it quietly, like a little lady'; or, 'How often have you been told _not_ to drink with your mouth full; this is not the servants' hall, remember!'","There were no signs of contretemps of any kind, nothing was upset or broken, and the cakes went easily round, though not a crumb was left over.",But the entire time Mr. Rogers was subjected to the keenest scrutiny imaginable.,Nothing he did escaped two pairs of eyes at least.,Signals were flashed below as well as above the table.,"These signals were of the kind birds know perhaps--others might be aware of their existence if they listened very attentively, yet might not interpret them.",No Comanche ever sent more deft communications unobserved to his brother across a camp fire.,"Yet nothing was done visibly; no crumb was flicked; and the table hid the pressure of the toe which, fortunately, no one intercepted.","Monkey, at any rate, had eyes in both her feet, and Jimbo knew how to keep his counsel without betrayal.","But inflections of the voice did most of the work--this, with flashes of brown and blue lights, conveyed the swift despatches.","'My underneath goes out to him,' Monkey telegraphed to her brother while she asked innocently for 'jam, please, Jimbo'; and he replied, 'Oh, he's all right, I think, but better not go too fast,' as he wiped the same article from his chin and caught her big brown eye upon him.","'He'll be our Leader,' she conveyed later by the way she stirred her cup of tea-hot-water-milk, 'when once we've got him ""out"" and taught him'; and Jimbo offered and accepted his own resignation of the coveted, long-held post by the way he let his eyelid twiddle in answer to her well-directed toe-nudge out of sight.","This, in a brief resume, was the purport of the give and take of numerous despatches between them during tea, while outwardly Mother-- and Father, too, when he thought about it--were delighted with their perfect company manners.","Jane Anne, outside all this flummery, went her own way upon an even keel.","She watched him closely too, but not covertly.","She stared him in the face, and imitated his delicate way of eating.",Once or twice she called him 'Mr.,"Rogers,' for this had a grown-up flavour about it that appealed to her, and 'Cousin Henry' did not come easily to her at first.",She could not forget that she had left the _ecole secondaire_ and was on her way to a Geneva Pension where she would attend an _ecole menagere_.,And the bursts of laughter that greeted her polite 'Mr.,"Rogers, did you have a nice journey, and do you like Bourcelles?'",--in a sudden pause that caught Mother balancing cup and teapot in mid-air--puzzled her a good deal.,"She liked his quiet answer though--'Thank you, Miss Campden, I think both quite charming.'",He did not laugh.,"He understood, whatever the others might think.","She had wished to correct the levity of the younger brother and sister, and he evidently appreciated her intentions.","He seemed a nice man, a very nice man.","Tea once over, she carried off the loaded tray to the kitchen to do the washing-up.",Jimbo and Monkey had disappeared.,"They always vanished about this time, but once the unenvied operation was safely under way, they emerged from their hiding-places again.",No one ever saw them go.,"They were gone before the order, 'Now, children, help your sister take the things away,' was even issued.",By the time they re-appeared Jinny was halfway through it and did not want to be disturbed.,"'Never mind, Mother,' she said, 'they're chronic.",They're only little busy Highlanders!',"For 'chronic' was another catch-word at the moment, and sometimes by chance she used it appropriately.",The source of 'busy Highlanders' was a mystery known only to herself.,"And resentment, like jealousy, was a human passion she never felt and did not understand.",Jane Anne was the spirit of unselfishness incarnate.,"It was to her honour, but made her ineffective as a personality.","Daddy lit his big old meerschaum--the 'squelcher' Jinny called it, because of its noise--and mooned about the room, making remarks on literature or politics, while Mother picked a work-basket cleverly from a dangerously overloaded shelf, and prepared to mend and sew.","The windows were wide open, and framed the picture of snowy Alps, now turning many-tinted in the slanting sunshine.","(Riquette, gorged with milk, appeared from the scullery and inspected knees and chairs and cushions that seemed available, selecting finally the best arm-chair and curling up to sleep.","Rogers smoked a cigarette, pleased and satisfied like the cat.)",A hush fell on the room.,It was the hour of peace between tea and the noisy Pension supper that later broke the spell.,"So quiet was it that the mouse began to nibble in the bedroom walls, and even peeped through the cracks it knew between the boards.","It came out, flicked its whiskers, and then darted in again like lightning.","Jane Anne, rinsing out the big teapot in the scullery, frightened it.","Presently she came in softly, put the lamp ready for her mother's needle, in case of need later, gave a shy queer look at 'Mr.","Rogers' and her father, both of whom nodded absent-mindedly to her, and then went on tip-toe out of the room.","She was bound for the village shop to buy methylated spirits, sugar, blotting-paper, and--a 'plaque' of Suchard chocolate for her Cousinenry.",The forty centimes for this latter was a large item in her savings; but she gave no thought to that.,What sorely perplexed her as she hurried down the street was whether he would like it 'milk' or 'plain.',In the end she bought both.,"Down the dark corridor of the Citadelle, before she left, she did not hear the muffled laughter among the shadows, nor see the movement of two figures that emerged together from the farther end.",'He'll be on the sofa by now.,Shall we go for him?',It was the voice of Monkey.,'Leave it to me.',Jimbo still meant to be leader so far as these two were concerned at any rate.,Let come later what might.,"'Better get Mother out of the way first, though.'",'Mother's nothing.,"She's sewing and things,' was the reply.",He understood the conditions thoroughly.,He needed no foolish advice.,'He's awfully easy.,You saw the two gold teeth.,"It's him, I'm sure.'","'Of course he's easy, only a person doesn't want to be pulled about after tea,' in the tone of a man who meant to feel his way a bit.",Clearly they had talked together more than once since the arrival at the station.,Jimbo made up for ignorance by decision and sublime self- confidence.,"He answered no silly questions, but listened, made up his mind, and acted.",He was primed to the brim--a born leader.,"'Better tell him that we'll come for him to-night,' the girl insisted.",'He'll be less astonished then.,You can tell he dreams a lot by his manner.,Even now he's only half awake.',The conversation was in French--school and village French.,Her brother ignored the question with 'va te cacher!',He had no doubts himself.,"'Just wait a moment while I tighten my belt,' he observed.","'You can tell it by his eyes,' he added, as Monkey urged him forward to the door.",'I know a good dreamer when I see one.',Then fate helped them.,"The door against their noses opened and Daddy came out, followed by his cousin.",All four collided.,"'Oh, is the washing-up finished?'","asked Monkey innocently, quick as a flash.",'How you startled me!',exclaimed Daddy.,'You really must try to be less impetuous.,"You'd better ask Mother about the washing,' he repeated, 'she's in there sewing.'","His thoughts, it seemed, were just a trifle confused.","Plates and linen both meant washing, and sometimes hair and other stuff as well.","'There's no light, you see, yet,' whispered Jimbo.",A small lamp usually hung upon the wall.,Jane Anne at that moment came out carrying it and asking for a match.,"'No starlight, either,' added Monkey quickly, giving her cousin a little nudge.","'It's all upwumbled, or whatever Daddy calls it.'","The look he gave her might well have suppressed a grown-up person-- 'grande personne,' as Jimbo termed it, translating literally--but on Monkey it had only slight effect.",Her irrepressible little spirit concealed springs few could regulate.,Even avoir-dupois increased their resiliency the moment it was removed.,But Jimbo checked her better than most.,She did look a trifle ashamed--for a second.,'Can't you wait?',he whispered.,'Daddy'll spoil it if you begin it here.,How you do fidget!',"They passed all together out into the yard, the men in front, the two children just behind, walking warily.","Then came the separation, yet none could say exactly how it was accomplished.","For separations are curious things at the best of times, the forces that effect them as mysterious as wind that blows a pair of butterflies across a field.",Something equally delicate was at work.,"One minute all four stood together by the fountain, and the next Daddy was walking downhill towards the carpenter's house alone, while the other three were already twenty metres up the street that led to the belt of forest.","Jimbo, perhaps, was responsible for the deft manoeuvring.","At any rate, he walked beside his big cousin with the air of a successful aide-de- camp.","But Monkey, too, seemed flushed with victory, rolling along--her rotundity ever suggested rolling rather than the taking of actual steps--as if she led a prisoner.","'Don't bother your cousin, children,' their father's voice was heard again faintly in the distance.",Then the big shoulder of La Citadelle hid him from view and hearing.,"And so the sight was seen of these three, arm in arm, passing along the village street in the twilight.","Gygi saw them go and raised his blue, peaked cap; and so did Henri Favre, standing in the doorway of his little shop, as he weighed the possible value of the new customer for matches, chocolate, and string--the articles English chiefly bought; and likewise Alfred Sandoz, looking a moment through the window of his cabaret, the Guillaume Tell, saw them go past like shadows towards the woods, and observed to his carter friend across the table, 'They choose queer times for expeditions, these English, _ouah!_' 'It's their climate makes them like that,' put in his wife, a touch of pity in her voice.","Her daughter swept the Den and lit the _fourneau_ for _la famille anglaise_ in the mornings, and the mother, knowing a little English, spelt out the weather reports in the _Daily Surprise_ she sometimes brought.","Meanwhile the three travellers had crossed the railway line, where Jimbo detained them for a moment's general explanation, and passed the shadow of the sentinel poplar.",The cluster of spring leaves rustled faintly on its crest.,The village lay behind them now.,They turned a moment to look back upon the stretch of vines and fields that spread towards the lake.,"From the pool of shadow where the houses nestled rose the spire of the church, a strong dark line against the fading sunset.",Thin columns of smoke tried to draw it after them.,"Lights already twinkled on the farther shore, five miles across, and beyond these rose dim white forms of the tremendous ghostly Alps.",Dusk slowly brought on darkness.,"Jimbo began to hum the song of the village he had learned in school--       P'tit Bourcelles sur sa colline       De partout a gentille mine;

they let it pass--politely.,"'London's stuffy, you know, just now,' he added, aware that he was convicted of exaggeration.","'Besides, it's spring.'","'There are millions of flowers here,' Jimbo covered his mistake kindly, 'millions and millions.","Aren't there, Monkey?'","'Oh, billions.'","'Of course,' he agreed.",'And more than anywhere else in the whole world.',"'It looks like that,' said Cousin Henry, as proudly as they said it themselves.","And they told him how they picked clothes-baskets full of the wild lily of the valley that grew upon the Boudry slopes, hepaticas, periwinkles, jonquils, blue and white violets, as well as countless anemones, and later, the big yellow marguerites.",'Then how long are you going to stay--_really_?',"inquired Monkey once again, as though the polite interlude were over.",It was a delicate way of suggesting that he had told an untruth.,She looked up straight into his face.,"And, meeting her big brown eyes, he wondered a little--for the first time--how he should reply.",'Daddy came here meaning to stay only six months--first.',"'When I was littler,' Jimbo put in. '",----and stayed here all this time--four years.',"'I hope to stay a week or so--just a little holiday, you know,' he said at length, giving the answer purposely.","But he said it without conviction, haltingly.",He felt that they divined the doubt in him.,"They guessed his thought along the hands upon his arm, as a horse finds out its rider from the touch upon the reins.",On either side big eyes watched and judged him; but the brown ones put a positive enchantment in his blood.,They shone so wonderfully in the dusk.,"'Longer than that, I think,' she told him, her own mind quite made up.",'It's not so easy to get away from.','You mean it?',he asked seriously.,'It makes one quite nervous.',"'There's such a lot to do here,' she said, still keeping her eyes fixed upon his face till he felt the wonder in him become a little unmanageable.",'You'll never get finished in a week.',"'My secretary,' he stammered, 'will help me,' and Jimbo nodded, fastening both hands upon his arm, while Monkey indulged in a little gust of curious laughter, as who should say 'He who laughs last, laughs best.'",They entered the edge of the forest.,Hepaticas watched them with their eyes of blue.,Violets marked their tread.,The frontiers of the daylight softly closed behind them.,"A thousand trees opened a way to let them pass, and moss twelve inches thick took their footsteps silently as birds.",They came presently to a little clearing where the pines stood in a circle and let in a space of sky.,"Looking up, all three saw the first small stars in it.",A wild faint scent of coming rain was in the air--those warm spring rains that wash the way for summer.,And a signal flashed unseen from the blue eyes to the brown.,"'This way,' said Jimbo firmly.","'There's an armchair rock where you can rest and get your wind a bit,' and, though Rogers had not lost his wind, he let himself be led, and took the great grey boulder for his chair.","Instantly, before he had arranged his weight among the points and angles, both his knees were occupied.","'By Jove,' flashed through his mind.",'They've brought me here on purpose.,I'm caught!',A tiny pause followed.,"'Now, look here, you little Schemers, I want to know what----' But the sentence was never finished.",The hand of Monkey was already pointing upwards to the space of sky.,"He saw the fringe of pine tops fencing it about with their feathery, crested ring, and in the centre shone faint, scattered stars.",Over the fence of mystery that surrounds common objects wonder peeped with one eye like a star.,"'Cousinenry,' he heard close to his ear, so soft it almost might have been those tree-tops whispering to the night, 'do you know anything about a Star Cave--a place where the starlight goes when there are no eyes or puddles about to catch it?'",A Star Cave!,How odd!,His own boyhood's idea.,"He must have mentioned it to his cousin perhaps, and _he_ had told the children.","And all that was in him of nonsense, poetry, love rose at a bound as he heard it.",He felt them settle themselves more comfortably upon his knees.,He forgot to think about the points and angles.,"Here surely a gateway was opening before his very feet, a gateway into that world of fairyland the old clergyman had spoken about.","A great wave of tenderness swept him--a flood strong and deep, as he had felt it long ago upon the hill of that Kentish village.",The golden boyhood's mood rushed over him once more with all its original splendour.,"It took a slightly different form, however.",He knew better how to direct it for one thing.,He pressed the children closer to his side.,'A what?',"he asked, speaking low as they did.",'Do I know a what?',"'A cave where lost starlight collects,' Monkey repeated, 'a Star Cave.'",And Jimbo said aloud the verses he had already learned by heart.,"While his small voice gave the words, more than a little mixed, a bird high up among the boughs woke from its beauty sleep and sang.",The two sounds mingled.,"But the singing of the bird brought back the scenery of the Vicarage garden, and with it the strange, passionate things the old clergyman had said.","The two scenes met in his mind, passed in and out of one another like rings of smoke, interchanged, and finally formed a new picture all their own, where flowers danced upon a carpet of star-dust that glittered in mid-air.","He knew some sudden, deep enchantment of the spirit.","The Fairyland the world had lost spread all about him, and--he had the children close.","The imaginative faculty that for years had invented ingenious patents, woke in force, and ran headlong down far sweeter channels--channels that fastened mind, heart, and soul together in a single intricate network of soft belief.",He remembered the dusk upon the Crayfield lawns.,"'Of course I know a Star Cave,' he said at length, when Jimbo had finished his recitation, and Monkey had added the details their father had told them.",'I know the very one your Daddy spoke about.,It's not far from where we're sitting.,It's over there.',"He pointed up to the mountain heights behind them, but Jimbo guided his hand in the right direction--towards the Boudry slopes where the forests dip upon the precipices of the Areuse.","'Yes, that's it--exactly,' he said, accepting the correction instantly; 'only _I_ go to the top of the mountains first so as to slide down with the river of starlight.'","'We go straight,' they told him in one breath.","'Because you've got more star-stuff in your eyes than I have, and find the way better,' he explained.",That touched their sense of pity.,"'But you can have ours,' they cried, 'we'll share it.'","'No,' he answered softly, 'better keep your own.",I can get plenty now.,"Indeed, to tell the truth--though it's a secret between ourselves, remember--that's the real reason I've come out here.",I want to get a fresh supply to take back to London with me.,"One needs a fearful lot in London----' 'But there's no sun in London to melt it,' objected Monkey instantly.","'There's fog though, and it gets lost in fog like ink in blotting- paper.",There's never enough to go round.,I've got to collect an awful lot before I go back.',"'That'll take more than a week,' she said triumphantly.","They fastened themselves closer against him, like limpets on a rock.","'I told you there was lots to do here,' whispered Monkey again.",'You'll never get it done in a week.','And how will you take it back?',asked Jimbo in the same breath.,The answer went straight to the boy's heart.,"'In a train, of course.","I've got an express train here on purpose----' 'The ""Rapide""?'","he interrupted, his blue eyes starting like flowers from the earth.",'Quicker far than that.,"I've got----' They stared so hard and so expectantly, it was almost like an interruption.",The bird paused in its rushing song to listen too. ',"----a Starlight Express,' he finished, caught now in the full tide of fairyland.",'It came here several nights ago.,It's being loaded up as full as ever it can carry.,I'm to drive it back again when once it's ready.','Where is it now?','Who's loading it?','How fast does it go?,Are there accidents and collisions?','How do you find the way?','May I drive it with you?','Tell us exactly everything in the world about it--at once!',"Questions poured in a flood about him, and his imagination leaped to their answering.",Above them the curtain of the Night shook out her million stars while they lay there talking with bated breath together.,"On every single point he satisfied them, and himself as well.","He told them all--his visit to the Manor House, the sprites he found there still alive and waiting as he had made them in his boyhood, their songs and characters, the Dustman, Sweep, and Lamplighter, the Laugher, and the Woman of the Haystack, the blue-eyed Guard---- 'But now her eyes are brown, aren't they?'","Monkey asked, peering very close into his face.",At the same moment she took his heart and hid it deep away among her tumbling hair.,'I was coming to that.,"They're brown now, of course, because in this different atmosphere brown eyes see better than blue in the dark.",The colours of signals vary in different countries.,"'And I'm the _mecanicien_,' cried Jimbo.",'I drive the engine.',"'And I'm your stoker,' he agreed, 'because here we burn wood instead of coal, and I'm director in a wood-paving company and so know all about it.'",They did not pause to dissect his logic--but just tore about full speed with busy plans and questionings.,He began to wonder how in the world he would satisfy them--and satisfy himself as well!--when the time should come to introduce them to Express and Cave and Passengers.,"For if he failed in that, the reality of the entire business must fall to the ground.",Yet the direct question did not come.,He wondered more and more.,Neither child luckily insisted on immediate tangible acquaintance.,They did not even hint about it.,"So far the whole thing had gone splendidly and easily, like floating a new company with the rosiest prospectus in the world; but the moment must arrive when profits and dividends would have to justify mere talk.",Concrete results would be demanded.,"If not forthcoming, where would his position be?","Yet, still the flood of questions, answers, explanations flowed on without the critical sentence making its appearance.",He had led them well--so far.,"How in the world, though, was he to keep it up, and provide definite result at the end?",Then suddenly the truth dawned upon him.,It was not he who led after all; it was they.,He was being led.,They knew.,They understood.,"The reins of management lay in their small capable hands, and he had never really held them at all.","Most cleverly, with utmost delicacy, they had concealed from him his real position.","They were Directors, he the merest shareholder, useful only for 'calls.'","The awkward question that he feared would never come, but instead he would receive instructions.",'Keep close to the children; they will guide you.',The words flashed back.,He was a helpless prisoner; but had only just discovered the fact.,He supplied the funds; they did the construction.,"Their plans and schemes netted his feet in fairyland just as surely as the weight of their little warm, soft bodies fastened him to the boulder where he sat.",He could not move.,He could not go further without their will and leadership.,But his captivity was utterly delightful to him....,The sound of a deep bell from the Colombier towers floated in to them between the trees.,The children sprang from his knees.,"He rose slowly, a little cramped and stiff.","'Half-past six,' said Jimbo.",'We must go back for supper.',"He stood there a moment, stretching, while the others waited, staring up at him as though he were a tree.",And he felt like a big tree; they were two wild-flowers his great roots sheltered down below.,"And at that moment, in the little pause before they linked up arms and started home again, the Question of Importance came, though not in the way he had expected it would come.","'Cousinenry, do you sleep very tightly at night, please?'","Monkey asked it, but Jimbo stepped up nearer to watch the reply.","'Like a top,' he said, wondering.",Signals he tried vainly to intercept flashed between the pair of them.,'Why do you ask?',as nothing further seemed forthcoming.,"'Oh, just to know,' she explained.",'It's all right.',"'Yes, it's quite all right like that,' added Jimbo.",And without more ado they took his arms and pulled him out of the forest.,"And Henry Rogers heard something deep, deep down within himself echo the verdict.",'I think it is all right.',"On the way home there were no puddles, but there were three pairs of eyes--and the stars were uncommonly thick overhead.",The children asked him almost as many questions as there were clusters of them between the summits of Boudry and La Tourne.,All three went floundering in that giant Net.,"It was so different, too, from anything they had been accustomed to.","Their father's stories, answers, explanations, and the like, were ineffective because they always felt he did not quite believe them himself even while he gave them.","He did not think he believed them, that is.",But Cousin Henry talked of stars and star- stuff as though he had some in his pocket at the moment.,"And, of course, he had.",For otherwise they would not have listened.,He could not have held their attention.,"They especially liked the huge, ridiculous words he used, because such words concealed great mysteries that pulsed with wonder and exquisitely wound them up.",Daddy made things too clear.,The bones of impossibility were visible.,"They saw thin nakedness behind the explanations, till the sense of wonder faded.",They were not babies to be fed with a string of one-syllable words!,"Jimbo kept silence mostly, his instinct ever being to conceal his ignorance; but Monkey talked fifteen to the dozen, filling the pauses with long 'ohs' and bursts of laughter and impudent observations.",Yet her cheeky insolence never crossed the frontier where it could be resented.,Her audacity stopped short of impertinence.,"'There's a point beyond which--' her cousin would say gravely, when she grew more daring than usual; and, while answering 'It'll stick into you, then, not into me,' she yet withdrew from the borders of impertinence at once.",'What is star-stuff really then?',she asked.,"'The primordial substance of the universe,' he answered solemnly, no whit ashamed of his inaccuracy.",'Ah yes!',"piped Jimbo, quietly.",_Ecole primaire_ he understood.,This must be something similar.,"'But what does it do, I mean, and why is it good for people to have it in them--on them--whatever it is?'",she inquired.,"'It gives sympathy and insight; it's so awfully subtle and delicate,' he answered.",'A little of it travels down on every ray and soaks down into you.,It makes you feel inclined to stick to other people and understand them.,That's sympathy.',"'_Sympathie_,' said Jimbo for his sister's benefit apparently, but in reality because he himself was barely treading water.","'But sympathy,' the other went on, 'is no good without insight--which means seeing things as others see them--from inside.","That's insight--- ' 'Inside sight,' she corrected him.",'That's it.,"You see, the first stuff that existed in the universe was this star-stuff--nebulae.","Having nothing else to stick to, it stuck to itself, and so got thicker.",It whirled in vortices.,"It grew together in sympathy, for sympathy brings together.",It whirled and twirled round itself till it got at last into solid round bodies--worlds-- stars.,"It passed, that is, from mere dreaming into action.","And when the rays soak into you, they change your dreaming into action.",You feel the desire to do things--for others.','Ah!,"yes,' repeated Jimbo, 'like that.'","'You must be full of vorty seas, then, because you're so long,' said Monkey, 'but you'll never grow into a solid round body----' He took a handful of her hair and smothered the remainder of the sentence.","'The instant a sweet thought is born in your mind,' he continued, 'the heavenly stables send their starry messengers to harness it for use.","A ray, perhaps, from mighty Sirius picks it out of your heart at birth.'",'Serious!',"exclaimed Jimbo, as though the sun were listening.","'Sirius--another sun, that is, far bigger than our own--a perfect giant, yet so far away you hardly notice him.'",The boy clasped his dirty fingers and stared hard.,The sun _was_ listening.,'Then what I _think_ is known--like that--all over the place?',he asked.,He held himself very straight indeed.,"'Everywhere,' replied Cousinenry gravely.",'The stars flash your thoughts over the whole universe.,None are ever lost.,Sooner or later they appear in visible shape.,"Some one, for instance, must have thought this flower long ago'--he stooped and picked a blue hepatica at their feet--'or it couldn't be growing here now.'",Jimbo accepted the statement with his usual gravity.,"'Then I shall always think enormous and tremendous things--powerful locomotives, like that and--and----' 'The best is to think kind little sweet things about other people,' suggested the other.",'You see the results quicker then.',"'Mais oui,' was the reply, 'je pourrai faire ca au meme temps, n'est- ce pas?'","'Parfaitemong,' agreed his big cousin.","'There's no room in her for inside sight,' observed Monkey as a portly dame rolled by into the darkness.",'You can't tell her front from her back.',It was one of the governesses.,"'We'll get her into the cave and change all that,' her cousin said reprovingly.",'You must never judge by outside alone.,Puddings should teach you that.',But no one could reprove Monkey without running a certain risk.,"'We don't have puddings here,' she said, 'we have dessert--sour oranges and apples.'",She flew from his side and vanished down the street and into the Citadelle courtyard before he could think of anything to say.,"A shooting star flashed at the same moment behind the church tower, vanishing into the gulf of Boudry's shadow.",They seemed to go at the same pace together.,"'Oh, I say!'","said Jimbo sedately, 'you must punish her for that, you know.",Shall I come with you to the carpenter's?',"he added, as they stood a moment by the fountain.",'There's just ten minutes to wash and brush your hair for supper.',"'I think I can find my way alone,' he answered, 'thank you all the same.'","'It's nothing,' he said, lifting his cap as the village fashion was, and watching his cousin's lengthy figure vanish down the street.","'We'll meet at the Pension later,' the voice came back, 'and in the morning I shall have a lot of correspondence to attend to.","Bring your shorthand book and lots of pencils, mind.'",'How many?',"'Oh, half a dozen will do.'",The boy turned in and hurried after his sister.,"But he was so busy collecting all the pencils and paper he could find that he forgot to brush his hair, and consequently appeared at the supper table with a head like a tangled blackberry bush.",His eyes were bright as stars.,"CHAPTER XIV      O pure one, take thy seat in the barque of the Sun,        And sail thou over the sky.","Sail thou with the imperishable stars,            Sail thou with the unwearied stars.","_Pyramid Texts, Dynasty VI._ But Henry Rogers ran the whole two hundred yards to his lodgings in the carpenter's house.",He ran as though the entire field of brilliant stars were at his heels.,"There was bewilderment, happiness, exhilaration in his blood.",He had never felt so light-hearted in his life.,He felt exactly fifteen years of age--and a half.,"The half was added to ensure a good, safe margin over the other two.","But he was late for supper too--later than the children, for first he jotted down some notes upon the back of an envelope.","He wrote them at high speed, meaning to correct them later, but the corrections were never made.","Later, when he came to bed, the envelope had been tidied away by the careful housewife into the dustbin.",And he was ashamed to ask for them.,The carpenter's wife read English.,"'Pity,' he said to himself.",'I don't believe Minks could have done it better!',The energy that went to the making of those 'notes' would have run down different channels a few years ago.,It would have gone into some ingenious patent.,"The patent, however, might equally have gone into the dustbin.",There is an enormous quantity of misdirected energy pouring loose about the world!,"The notes had run something like this--      O children, open your arms to me,      Let your hair fall over my eyes;      Let me sleep a moment--and then awake      In your Gardens of sweet Surprise!","For the grown-up folk      Are a wearisome folk,      And they laugh my fancies to scorn,      My fun and my fancies to scorn.","O children, open your hearts to me,      And tell me your wonder-thoughts;      Who lives in the palace inside your brain?",Who plays in its outer courts?,Who hides in the hours To-morrow holds?,Who sleeps in your yesterdays?,Who tiptoes along past the curtained folds      Of the shadow that twilight lays?,"O children, open your eyes to me,      And tell me your visions too;      Who squeezes the sponge when the salt tears flow      To dim their magical blue?",Who draws up their blinds when the sun peeps in?,Who fastens them down at night?,Who brushes the fringe of their lace-veined lids?,Who trims their innocent light?,"Then, children, I beg you, sing low to me,      And cover my eyes with your hands;      O kiss me again till I sleep and dream      That I'm lost in your fairylands;      For the grown-up folk      Are a troublesome folk,      And the book of their childhood is torn,      Is blotted, and crumpled, and torn!","Supper at the Pension dissipated effectively the odd sense of enchantment to which he had fallen a victim, but it revived again with a sudden rush when Jimbo and his sister came up at half-past eight to say good-night.","It began when the little fellow climbed up to plant a resounding kiss upon his lips, and it caught him fullest when Monkey's arms were round his neck, and he heard her whisper in his ear-- 'Sleep as tightly as you can, remember, and don't resist.",We'll come later to find you.',Her brown eyes were straight in front of his own.,"Goodness, how they shone!",Old Sirius and Aldebaran had certainly left a ray in each.,'Hope you don't get any longer when you're asleep!',"she added, giving him a sly dig in the ribs--then was gone before he could return it, or ask her what she meant by 'we'll find you later.'","'And don't say a word to Mother,' was the last thing he heard as she vanished down the stairs.","Slightly confused, he glanced down at the aged pumps he happened to have on, and noticed that one bow was all awry and loose.","He stooped to fidget with it, and Mother caught him in the act.","'I'll stitch it on for you,' she said at once.",'It won't take a minute.,One of the children can fetch it in the morning.',But he was ashamed to add to her endless sewing.,"Like some female Sisyphus, she seemed always pushing an enormous needle through a mountain of clothes that grew higher each time she reached the top.","'I always wear it like that,' he assured her gravely, his thoughts still busy with two other phrases--' find you' and 'sleep tightly.'",What in the world could they mean?,Did the children really intend to visit him at night?,They seemed so earnest about it.,Of course it was all nonsense.,And yet----!,"'You mustn't let them bother you too much,' he heard their mother saying, her voice sounding a long way off.",'They're so wildly happy to have some one to play with.',"'That's how I like them,' he answered vaguely, referring half to the pumps and half to the children.","'They're no trouble at all, believe me.'","'I'm afraid we've spoilt them rather----' 'But--not at all,' he murmured, still confused.","'They're only a little loose--er--lively, I mean.",That's how they should be.',And outside all heard their laughing voices dying down the street as they raced along to the Citadelle for bed.,It was Monkey's duty to see her brother safely in.,Ten minutes later Mother would follow to tell them tuck-up stories and hear their prayers.,'Excuse me!,Have you got a hot-water bottle?',"asked a sudden jerky voice, and he turned with a start to see Jane Anne towering beside him.","'I'm sorry,' he answered, 'but I don't carry such things about with me.'","He imagined she was joking, then saw that it was very serious.",She looked puzzled a moment.,'I meant--would you like one?,Everybody uses them here.',She thought all grown-ups used hot-water bottles.,He hesitated a second.,The child looked as though she would produce one from her blouse like any conjurer.,"As yet, however, the article in question had not entered his scheme of life.",He declined it with many thanks.,"'I can get you a big one,' she urged.",But even that did not tempt him.,'Will you have a cold-water bandage then--for your head--or anything?',She seemed so afflicted with a desire to do something for him that he almost said 'Yes'; only the fear that she might offer next a beehive or a gramophone restrained him.,"'Thank you _so_ much, but really I can manage without it--to-night.'",Jane Anne made no attempt to conceal her disappointment.,"What a man he was, to be sure!",And what a funny place the world was!,"'It's Jinny's panacea,' said Mother, helping herself with reckless uncertainty to a long word.","'She's never happy unless she's doing for somebody,' she added ambiguously.",'It's her _metier_ in life.',"'Mother, what _are_ you saying?'",said the child's expression.,Then she made one last attempt.,"She remembered, perhaps, the admiring way he had watched her brother and sister's antics in the Den before.","She was not clever on her feet, but at least she could try.","'Shall I turn head over heels for you, then?'",He caught her mother's grave expression just in time to keep his laughter back.,The offer of gymnastics clearly involved sacrifice somewhere.,"'To-morrow,' he answered quickly.",'Always put off till to-morrow what you're too old to do to-day.','Of course; I see--yes.',"She was more perplexed than ever, as he meant that she should be.","His words were meaningless, but they helped the poignant situation neatly.",She could not understand why all her offers were refused like this.,"There must be something wrong with her selection, perhaps.",She would think of better ones in future.,"But, oh, what a funny place the world was!","'Good-night, then, Mr.--Cousin Rogers,' she said jerkily with resignation.",'Perhaps to-morrow--when I'm older----' 'If it comes.',"He gravely shook the hand she held out primly, keeping a certain distance from him lest he should attempt to kiss her.","'It always comes; it's a chronic monster,' she laughed, saying the first thing that came into her queer head.",They all laughed.,"Jane Anne went out, feeling happier.","At least, she had amused him.",She marched off with the air of a grenadier going to some stern and difficult duty.,"From the door she flung back at him a look of speechless admiration, then broke into a run, afraid she might have been immodest or too forward.",They heard her thumping overhead.,And presently he followed her example.,The Pension sitting-room emptied.,"Unless there was something special on hand--a dance, a romp, a game, or some neighbours who dropped in for talk and music--it was rarely occupied after nine o'clock.",Daddy had already slipped home--he had this mysterious way of disappearing when no one saw him go.,"At this moment, doubtless, a wumbled book absorbed him over at the carpenter's.","Old Miss Waghorn sat in a corner nodding over her novel, and the Pension cat, Borelle, was curled up in her sloping, inadequate lap.","The big, worn velvet sofa in the opposite corner was also empty.","On romping nights it was the _train de Moscou_, where Jimbo sold tickets to crowded passengers for any part of the world.","To-night it was a mere dead sofa, uninviting, dull.","He went across the darkened room, his head scraping acquaintance with the ivy leaves that trailed across the ceiling.",He slipped through the little hall.,In the kitchen he heard the shrill voice of Mme.,"Jequier talking very loudly about a dozen things at once to the servant-girl, or to any one else who was near enough to listen.",Luckily she did not see him.,"Otherwise he would never have escaped without another offer of a hot-water bottle, a pot of home-made marmalade, or a rug and pillow for his bed.",He made his way downstairs into the street unnoticed; but just as he reached the bottom his thundering tread betrayed him.,The door flew open at the top.,"'Bon soir, bonne nuit,' screamed the voice; 'wait a moment and I'll get the lamp.",You'll break your neck.,"Is there anything you want--a hot-water bottle, or a box of matches, or some of my marmalade for your breakfast?","Wait, and I'll get it in a moment----' She would have given the blouse off her back had he needed, or could have used it.",She flew back to the kitchen to search and shout.,"It sounded like a quarrel; but, pretending not to hear, he made good his escape and passed out into the street.","The heavy door of the Post Office banged behind him, cutting short a stream of excited sentences.",The peace and quiet of the night closed instantly about his steps.,By the fountain opposite the Citadelle he paused to drink from the pipe of gushing mountain water.,"The open courtyard looked inviting, but he did not go in, for, truth to tell, there was a curious excitement in him--an urgent, keen desire to get to sleep as soon as possible.","Not that he felt sleepy--quite the reverse in fact, but that he looked forward to his bed and to 'sleeping tightly.'",The village was already lost in slumber.,No lights showed in any houses.,Yet it was barely half-past nine.,Everywhere was peace and stillness.,Far across the lake he saw the twinkling villages.,Behind him dreamed the forests.,"A deep calm brooded over the mountains; but within the calm, and just below the surface in himself, hid the excitement as of some lively anticipation.",He expected something.,Something was going to happen.,And it was connected with the children.,Jimbo and Monkey were at the bottom of it.,They had said they would come for him--to 'find him later.',He wondered--quite absurdly he wondered.,"He passed his cousin's room on tiptoe, and noticed a light beneath the door.","But, before getting into bed, he stood a moment at the open window and drew in deep draughts of the fresh night air.",The world of forest swayed across his sight.,The outline of the Citadelle merged into it.,A point of light showed the window where the children already slept.,"But, far beyond, the moon was loading stars upon the trees, and a rising wind drove them in glittering flocks along the heights....","Blowing out the candle, he turned over on his side to sleep, his mind charged to the brim with wonder and curious under-thrills of this anticipation.",He half expected--what?,Reality lay somewhere in the whole strange business; it was not merely imaginative nonsense.,Fairyland was close.,"And the moment he slept and began to dream, the thing took a lively and dramatic shape.","A thousand tiny fingers, soft and invisible, drew him away into the heart of fairyland.",There was a terror in him lest he should--stick.,"But he came out beautifully and smoothly, like a thread of summer grass from its covering sheath.","'I _am_ slippery after all, then--slippery enough,' he remembered saying with surprised delight, and then---- CHAPTER XV                          Look how the floor of heaven       Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold.","There's not the smallest orb which thou beholdest       But in his motion like an angel sings,       Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims.",_Merchant of Venice_.,"----there came to him a vivid impression of sudden light in the room, and he knew that something very familiar was happening to him, yet something that had not happened consciously for thirty years and more --since his early childhood in the night-nursery with the bars across the windows.",He was both asleep and awake at the same time.,"Some part of him, rather, that never slept was disengaging itself--with difficulty.",He was getting free.,"Stimulated by his intercourse with the children, this part of him that in boyhood used to be so easily detached, light as air, was getting loose.",The years had fastened it in very tightly.,Jimbo and Monkey had got at it.,And Jimbo and Monkey were in the room at this moment.,They were pulling him out.,It was very wonderful; a glory of youth and careless joy rushed through him like a river.,Some sheath or vesture melted off.,It seemed to tear him loose.,How in the world could he ever have forgotten it-- let it go out of his life?,What on earth could have seemed good enough to take its place?,"He felt like an eagle some wizard spell had imprisoned in a stone, now released and shaking out its crumpled wings.",A mightier spell had set him free.,The children stood beside his bed!,"'I can manage it alone,' he said firmly.",'You needn't try to help me.',"No sound was audible, but they instantly desisted.","This thought, that took a dozen words to express ordinarily, shot from him into them the instant it was born.","A gentle pulsing, like the flicker of a flame, ran over their shining little forms of radiance as they received it.",They shifted to one side silently to give him room.,Thus had he seen a searchlight pass like lightning from point to point across the sea.,"Yet, at first, there was difficulty; here and there, in places, he could not get quite loose and free.","'He sticks like Daddy,' he heard them think.","'In the head it seems, too.'","There was no pain in the sensation, but a certain straining as of unaccustomed muscles being stretched.","He felt uncomfortable, then embarrassed, then--exhilarated.",But there were other exquisite sensations too.,"Happiness, as of flooding summer sunshine, poured through him.",'He'll come with a rush.,Look out!',"felt Jimbo--'felt' expressing 'thought' and 'said' together, for no single word can convey the double operation thus combined in ordinary life.",The reality of it caught him by the throat.,"'This,' he exclaimed, 'is real and actual.",It is happening to me now!',"He looked from the pile of clothes taken off two hours ago--goodness, what a mass!--to the children's figures in the middle of the room.",And one was as real as the other.,"The moods of the day and evening, their play and nonsense, had all passed away.",He had crossed a gulf that stood between this moment and those good-nights in the Pension.,This was as real as anything in life; more real than death.,Reality--he caught the obvious thought pass thickly through the body on the bed-- is what has been experienced.,"Death, for that reason, is not real, not realised; dinner is.","And this was real because he had been through it, though long forgotten it.",Jimbo stood aside and 'felt' directions.,"'Don't push,' he said.","'Just think and wish,' added Monkey with a laugh.","It was her laugh, and perhaps the beauty of her big brown eyes as well, that got him finally loose.","For the laughter urged some queer, deep yearning in him towards a rush of exquisite accomplishment.",He began to slip more easily and freely.,"The brain upon the bed, oddly enough, remembered a tradition of old Egypt--that Thoth created the world by bursting into seven peals of laughter.",It touched forgotten springs of imagination and belief.,"In some tenuous, racy vehicle his thought flashed forth.","With a gliding spring, like a swooping bird across a valley, he was suddenly--out.",'I'm out!',he cried.,'All out!',echoed the answering voices.,And then he understood that first vivid impression of light.,"It was everywhere, an evenly distributed light.","He saw the darkness of the night as well, the deep old shadows that draped the village, woods, and mountains.","But in themselves was light, a light that somehow enabled them to see everything quite clearly.",Solid things were all transparent.,Light even radiated from objects in the room.,"Two much-loved books upon the table shone beautifully--his Bible and a volume of poems; and, fairer still, more delicate than either, there was a lustre on the table that had so brilliant a halo it almost corruscated.",The sparkle in it was like the sparkle in the children's eyes.,"It came from the bunch of violets, gentians, and hepaticas, already faded, that Mother had placed there days ago on his arrival.","And overhead, through plaster, tiles, and rafters he saw--the stars.","'We've already been for Jinny,' Jimbo informed him; 'but she's gone as usual.",She goes the moment she falls asleep.,We never can catch her up or find her.',"'Come on,' cried Monkey.",'How slow you both are!,We shan't get anywhere at this rate.',And she made a wheel of coloured fire in the air.,"'I'm ready,' he answered, happier than either.",'Let's be off at once.',"Through his mind flashed this explanation of their elder sister's day- expression--that expression of a moth she had, puzzled, distressed, only half there, as the saying is.","For if she went out so easily at night in this way, some part of her probably stayed out altogether.",She never wholly came back.,She was always dreaming.,"The entire instinct of the child, he remembered, was for others, and she thought of herself as little as did the sun--old tireless star that shines for all.","'She's soaked in starlight,' he cried, as they went off headlong.",'We shall find her in the Cave.,"Come on, you pair of lazy meteors.'","He was already far beyond the village, and the murmur of the woods rose up to them.","They entered the meshes of the Star Net that spun its golden threads everywhere about them, linking up the Universe with their very hearts.",'There are no eyes or puddles to-night.,Everybody sleeps.,"Hooray, hooray!'",they cried together.,"There were cross-currents, though.","The main, broad, shining stream poured downwards in front of them towards the opening of the Cave, a mile or two beyond, where the forests dipped down among the precipices of the Areuse; but from behind--from some house in the slumbering village--came a golden tributary too, that had a peculiar and astonishing brightness of its own.","It came, so far as they could make out, from the humped outline of La Citadelle, and from a particular room there, as though some one in that building had a special source of supply.","Moreover, it scattered itself over the village in separate swift rivulets that dived and dipped towards particular houses here and there.","There seemed a constant coming and going, one stream driving straight into the Cave, and another pouring out again, yet neither mingling.","One stream brought supplies, while the other directed their distribution.","Some one, asleep or awake--they could not tell--was thinking golden thoughts of love and sympathy for the world.",'It's Mlle.,"Lemaire,' said Jimbo.",'She's been in bed for thirty years---' His voice was very soft.,"'The Spine, you know,' exclaimed Monkey, a little in the rear. '","----and even in the daytime she looks white and shiny,' added the boy.",'I often go and talk with her and tell her things.',He said it proudly.,'She understands everything--better even than Mother.',Jimbo had told most.,It was all right.,His leadership was maintained and justified.,They entered the main stream and plunged downwards with it towards the earth--three flitting figures dipped in this store of golden brilliance.,A delicious and wonderful thing then happened.,All three remembered.,"'This was where we met you first,' they told him, settling down among the trees together side by side.",'We saw your teeth of gold.,"You came in that train----' 'I was thinking about it--in England,' he exclaimed, 'and about coming out to find you here.'","'The Starlight Express,' put in Jimbo. '","----and you were just coming up to speak to us when we woke, or you woke, or somebody woke--and it all went,' said Monkey.","'That was when I stopped thinking about it,' he explained.",'It all vanished anyhow.,"And the next time was'--she paused a moment-- 'you--we saw your two gold teeth again somewhere, and half recognised you----' It was the daylight world that seemed vague and dreamlike now, hard to remember clearly.","'In another train--' Jimbo helped her, 'the Geneva omnibus that starts at--at----' But even Jimbo could not recall further details.","'You're wumbled,' said Rogers, helping himself and the others at the same time.",'You want some starlight to put you in touch again.,Come on; let's go in.,"We shall find all the others inside, I suspect, hard at it.'",'At what?',asked two breathless voices.,"'Collecting, of course--for others.","Did you think they ate the stuff, just to amuse themselves?'","'They glided towards the opening, cutting through the little tributary stream that was pouring out on its way down the sky to that room in La Citadelle.","It was brighter than the main river, they saw, and shone with a peculiar brilliance of its own, whiter and swifter than the rest.","Designs, moreover, like crystals floated on the crest of every wave.","'That's the best quality,' he told them, as their faces shone a moment in its glory.",'The person who deserves it must live entirely for others.,That he keeps only for the sad and lonely.,"The rest, the common stuff, is good enough for Fraulein or for baby, or for mother, or any other----' The words rose in him like flowers that he knew.","'Look out, _mon vieux_!",'It was Monkey's voice.,They just had time to stand aside as a figure shot past them and disappeared into the darkness above the trees.,"A big bundle, dripping golden dust, hung down his back.",'The Dustman!',"they cried with excitement, easily recognising his energetic yet stooping figure; and Jimbo added, 'the dear old Dustman!'","while Monkey somersaulted after him, returning breathless a minute later with, 'He's gone; I couldn't get near him.","He went straight to La Citadelle----' And then collided violently with the Lamplighter, whose pole of office caught her fairly in the middle and sent her spinning like a conjurer's plate till they feared she would never stop.",She kept on laughing the whole time she spun--like a catherine wheel that laughs instead of splutters.,"The place where the pole caught her, however--it was its lighted end--shines and glows to this day: the centre of her little heart.","'Do let's be careful,' pleaded Jimbo, hardly approving of these wild gyrations.",He really did prefer his world a trifle more dignified.,He was ever the grave little gentleman.,"They stooped to enter by the narrow opening, but were stopped again-- this time by some one pushing rudely past them to get in.","From the three points of the compass to which the impact scattered them, they saw a shape of darkness squeeze itself, sack and all, to enter.","An ordinary man would have broken every bone in his body, judging by the portion that projected into the air behind.","But he managed it somehow, though the discomfort must have been intolerable, they all thought.",The darkness dropped off behind him in flakes like discarded clothing; he turned to gold as he went in; and the contents of his sack--he poured it out like water--shone as though he squeezed a sponge just dipped in the Milky Way.,"'What a lot he's collected,' cried Rogers from his point of vantage where he could see inside.",'It all gets purified and clean in there.,Wait a moment.,He's coming out again--off to make another collection.',And then they knew the man for what he was.,"He shot past them into the night, carrying this time a flat and emptied sack, and singing like a blackbird as he went:--     Sweeping chimneys and cleaning flues,     That is the work I love;     Brushing away the blacks and the blues,     And letting in light from above!","I twirl my broom in your tired brain     When you're tight in sleep up-curled,     Then scatter the stuff in a soot-like rain     Over the edge of the world.","The voice grew fainter and fainter in the distance--     For I'm a tremendously busy Sweep,     Catching the folk when they're all asleep,     And tossing the blacks on the Rubbish Heap     Over the edge of the world...!","The voice died away into the wind among the high branches, and they heard it no more.","'There's a Sweep worth knowing,' murmured Rogers, strong yearning in him.","'There are no blacks or blues in _my_ brain,' exclaimed Monkey, 'but Jimbo's always got some on his face.'",The impudence passed ignored.,Jimbo took his cousin's hand and led him to the opening.,The 'men' went in first together; the other sex might follow as best it could.,Yet somehow or other Monkey slipped between their legs and got in before them.,They stood up side by side in the most wonderful place they had ever dreamed of.,And the first thing they saw was--Jane Anne.,'I'm collecting for Mother.,"Her needles want such a chronic lot, you see.'",Her face seemed full of stars; there was no puzzled expression in the eyes now.,She looked beautiful.,And the younger children stared in sheer amazement and admiration.,"'I have no time to waste,' she said, moving past them with a load in her spread apron that was like molten gold; 'I have to be up and awake at six to make your porridge before you go to school.","I'm a busy monster, I can tell you!'","She went by them like a flash, and out into the night.","Monkey felt tears in her somewhere, but they did not fall.",Something in her turned ashamed--for a moment.,Jimbo stared in silence.,'What a girl!',he thought.,'I'd like to be like that!',Already the light was sticking to him.,"'So this is where she always comes,' said Monkey, soon recovering from the temporary attack of emotion.",'She's better out than in; she's safest when asleep!,No wonder she's so funny in the daytime.',"Then they turned to look about them, breathing low as wild-flowers that watch a rising moon.",The place was so big for one thing--far bigger than they had expected.,The storage of lost starlight must be a serious affair indeed if it required all this space to hold it.,The entire mountain range was surely hollow.,Another thing that struck them was the comparative dimness of this huge interior compared with the brilliance of the river outside.,"But, of course, lost things are ever dim, and those worth looking for dare not be too easily found.","A million tiny lines of light, they saw, wove living, moving patterns, very intricate and very exquisite.",These lines and patterns the three drew in with their very breath.,They swallowed light--the tenderest light the world can know.,A scent of flowers--something between a violet and a wild rose--floated over all.,And they understood these patterns while they breathed them in.,They read them.,"Patterns in Nature, of course, are fairy script.","Here lay all their secrets sweetly explained in golden writing, all mysteries made clear.","The three understood beyond their years; and inside-sight, instead of glimmering, shone.","For, somehow or other, the needs of other people blazed everywhere, obliterating their own.",It was most singular.,Monkey ceased from somersaulting and stared at Jimbo.,'You've got two stars in your face instead of eyes.,They'll never set!',she whispered.,'I love you because I understand every bit of you.',"'And you,' he replied, as though he were a grande personne, 'have got hair like a mist of fire.",It will never go out!',"'Every one will love me now,' she cried, 'my underneath is gold.'",But her brother reproved her neatly:-- 'Let's get a lot--simply an awful lot'--he made a grimace to signify quantity--'and pour it over Daddy's head till it runs from his eyes and beard.,He'll write real fairy stories then and make a fortune.',And Cousin Henry moved past them like a burning torch.,They held their breath to see him.,"Jane Anne, their busy sister, alone excelled him in brightness.","Her perfume, too, was sweeter.","'He's an old hand at this game,' Monkey said in French.","'But Jinny's never done anything else since she was born,' replied her brother proudly.","And they all three fell to collecting, for it seemed the law of the place, a kind of gravity none could disobey.",They stooped--three semi- circles of tender brilliance.,"Each lost the least desire to gather for himself; the needs of others drove them, filled them, made them eager and energetic.","'Riquette would like a bit,' cried Jimbo, almost balancing on his head in his efforts to get it all at once, while Monkey's shining fingers stuffed her blouse and skirts with sheaves of golden gossamer that later she meant to spread in a sheet upon the pillow of Mademoiselle Lemaire.","'She sleeps so little that she needs the best,' she sang, realising for once that her own amusement was not the end of life.",'I'll make her nights all wonder.',"Cousinenry, meanwhile, worked steadily like a man who knows his time is short.","He piled the stuff in heaps and pyramids, and then compressed it into what seemed solid blocks that made his pockets bulge like small balloons.",Already a load was on his back that bent him double.,"'Such a tiny bit is useful,' he explained, 'if you know exactly how and where to put it.",This compression is my own patent.',"'Of course,' they echoed, trying in vain to pack it up as cleverly as he did.",Nor were these three the only gatherers.,The place was full of movement.,"Jane Anne was always coming back for more, deigning no explanations.",She never told where she had spent her former loads.,"She gathered an apron full, sped off to spend and scatter it in places she knew of, and then came bustling in again for more.",And they always knew her whereabouts because of the whiter glory that she radiated into the dim yellow world about them.,"And other figures, hosts of them, were everywhere--stooping, picking, loading one another's backs and shoulders.","To and fro they shot and glided, like Leonids in autumn round the Earth.","All were collecting, though the supply seemed never to grow less.","An inexhaustible stream poured in through the narrow opening, and scattered itself at once in all directions as though driven by a wind.","How could the world let so much escape it, when it was what the world most needed every day.","It ran naturally into patterns, patterns that could be folded and rolled up like silken tablecloths.","In silence, too.",There was no sound of drops falling.,Sparks fly on noiseless feet.,Sympathy makes no bustle.,"'Even on the thickest nights it falls,' a voice issued from a robust patch of light beside them that stooped with huge brown hands all knotted into muscles; 'and it's a mistake to think different.'","His voice rolled on into a ridiculous bit of singing:--      It comes down with the rain drops,      It comes down with the dew,      There's always 'eaps for every one--      For 'im and me and you.","They recognised his big face, bronzed by the sun, and his great neck where lines drove into the skin like the rivers they drew with blunt pencils on their tedious maps of Europe.",It was several faces in one.,"The Head Gardener was no stranger to their imaginations, for they remembered him of old somewhere, though not quite sure exactly where.","He worked incessantly for others, though these 'others' were only flowers and cabbages and fruit-trees.","He did his share in the world, he and his army of queer assistants, the under-gardeners.","Peals of laughter, too, sounded from time to time in a far away corner of the cavern, and the laughter sent all the stuff it reached into very delicate, embroidered patterns.","For it was merry and infectious laughter, joy somewhere in it like a lamp.",It bordered upon singing; another touch would send it rippling into song.,"And to that far corner, attracted by the sound, ran numberless rivulets of light, weaving a lustrous atmosphere about the Laugher that, even while it glowed, concealed the actual gatherer from sight.",The children only saw that the patterns were even more sweet and dainty than their own.,And they understood.,Inside-sight explained the funny little mystery.,Laughter is magical--brings light and help and courage.,"They laughed themselves then, and instantly saw their own patterns wave and tremble into tiny outlines that they could squeeze later even into the darkest, thickest head.","Cousinenry, meanwhile, they saw, stopped for nothing.","He was singing all the time as he bent over his long, outstretched arms.",And it was the singing after all that made the best patterns--better even than the laughing.,He knew all the best tricks of this Star Cave.,He remained their leader.,"And the stuff no hands picked up ran on and on, seeking a way of escape for itself.","Some sank into the ground to sweeten the body of the old labouring earth, colouring the roots of myriad flowers; some soaked into the rocky walls, tinting the raw materials of hills and woods and mountain tops.","Some escaped into the air in tiny drops that, meeting in moonlight or in sunshine, instantly formed wings.",And people saw a brimstone butterfly--all wings and hardly any body.,All went somewhere for some useful purpose.,It was not in the nature of star-stuff to keep still.,"Like water that must go down-hill, the law of its tender being forced it to find a place where it could fasten on and shine.","It never could get wholly lost; though, if the place it settled on was poor, it might lose something of its radiance.",But human beings were obviously what most attracted it.,Sympathy must find an outlet; thoughts are bound to settle somewhere.,"And the gatherers all sang softly--'Collect for others, never mind yourself!'","Some of it, too, shot out by secret ways in the enormous roof.",The children recognised the exit of the separate brilliant stream they had encountered in the sky--the one especially that went to the room of pain and sickness in La Citadelle.,Again they understood.,That unselfish thinker of golden thoughts knew special sources of supply.,No wonder that her atmosphere radiated sweetness and uplifting influence.,"Her patience, smiles, and courage were explained.","Passing through the furnace of her pain, the light was cleansed and purified.","Hence the delicate, invariable radiation from her presence, voice, and eyes.","From the bed of suffering she had not left for thirty years she helped the world go round more sweetly and more easily, though few divined those sudden moments of beauty they caught flashing from her halting words, nor guessed their source of strength.","'Of course,' thought Jimbo, laughing, 'I see now why I like to go and tell her everything.",She understands all before I've said it.,She's simply stuffed with starlight--bursting with inside-sight.',"'That's sympathy,' his cousin added, hearing the vivid thought.",And he worked away like an entire ant-heap.,But he was growing rather breathless now.,"'There's too much for me,' he laughed as though his mouth were full.",'I can't manage it all!',"He was wading to the waist, and his coat and trousers streamed with runnels of orange-coloured light.",'Swallow it then!',"cried Monkey, her hair so soaked that she kept squeezing it like a sponge, both eyes dripping too.","It was their first real experience of the joy of helping others, and they hardly knew where to begin or end.","They romped and played in the stuff like children in sand or snow--diving, smothering themselves, plunging, choking, turning somersaults, upsetting each other's carefully reared loads, and leaping over little pyramids of gold.","Then, in a flash, their laughter turned the destroyed heaps into wonderful new patterns again; and once more they turned sober and began to work.",But their cousin was more practical.,"'I've got all I can carry comfortably,' he sang out at length.",'Let's go out now and sow it among the sleepers.,Come on!',A field of stars seemed to follow him from the roof as he moved with difficulty towards the opening of the cave.,Some one shot out just in front of him.,'My last trip!',The words reached them from outside.,"His bulging figure squeezed somehow through the hole, layers of light scraping off against the sides.",The children followed him.,But no one stuck.,"All were beautifully elastic; the starlight oiled and greased their daring, subtle star-bodies.","Laden to the eyes, they sped across the woods that still slept heavily.","The tips of the pines, however, were already opening a million eyes.",There was a faint red glimmer in the east.,Hours had passed while they were collecting.,'The Interfering Sun is on the way.,Look out!',"cried some one, shooting past them like an unleashed star.",'I must get just a little more--my seventeenth journey to-night!',"And Jane Anne, the puzzled look already come back a little into her face, darted down towards the opening.",The waking of the body was approaching.,'What a girl!',"thought Jimbo again, as they hurried after their grown- up cousin towards the village.","And here, but for the leadership of Cousin Henry, they must have gone astray and wasted half their stores in ineffective fashion.","Besides, the east was growing brighter, and there was a touch of confusion in their little star-bodies as sleep grew lighter and the moment of the body's waking drew nearer.",Ah!,the exquisite adjustment that exists between the night and day bodies of children!,"It is little wonder that with the process of growing-up there comes a coarsening that congeals the fluid passages of exit, and finally seals the memory centres too.","Only in a few can this delicate adjustment be preserved, and the sources of inspiration known to children be kept available and sweet--in the poets, dreamers, and artists of this practical, steel-girdled age.","'This way,' called Cousinenry.",'Follow me.',They settled down in a group among Madame Jequier's lilacs.,'We'll begin with the Pension des Glycines.,Jinny is already busy with La Citadelle.',They perched among the opening blossoms.,"Overhead flashed by the Sweep, the Dustman, and the Laugher, bound for distant ports, perhaps as far as England.",The Head Gardener lumbered heavily after them to find his flowers and trees.,"Starlight, they grasped, could be no separate thing.","The rays started, indeed, from separate points, but all met later in the sky to weave this enormous fairy network in which the currents and cross-currents and criss-cross-currents were so utterly bewildering.","Alone, the children certainly must have got lost in the first five minutes.","Their cousin gathered up the threads from Monkey's hair and Jimbo's eyes, and held them in one hand like reins.","He sang to them a moment while they recovered their breath and forces:--      The stars in their courses      Are runaway horses      That gallop with Thoughts from the Earth;      They collect them, and race      Back through wireless space,      Bringing word of the tiniest birth;      Past old Saturn and Mars,      And the hosts of big stars,      Who strain at their leashes for joy.","Kind thoughts, like fine weather,        Bind sweetly together        God's suns--with the heart of a boy.","So, beware what you think;     It is written in ink     That is golden, and read by His Stars!",'Hadn't we better get on?',"cried Monkey, pulling impatiently at the reins he held.","'Yes,' echoed Jimbo.",'Look at the sky.,"The ""rapide"" from Paris comes past at six o'clock.'","CHAPTER XVI     Aus den Himmelsaugen droben     Fallen zitternd goldne Funken     Durch die Nacht, und meine Seele     Dehnt sich liebeweit und weiter.","O ihr Himmelsaugen droben,     Weint euch aus in meine Seele,     Dass von lichten Sternentranen     Uberfliesset meine Seele!",Heine.,"They rose, fluttered a moment above the lilac bushes, and then shot forward like the curve of a rainbow into the sleeping house.",The next second they stood beside the bed of the Widow Jequier.,"She lay there, so like a bundle of untidy sticks that, but for the sadness upon the weary face, they could have burst out laughing.","The perfume of the wistaria outside the open window came in sweetly, yet could not lighten the air of heavy gloom that clothed her like a garment.","Her atmosphere was dull, all streaked with greys and black, for her mind, steeped in anxiety even while she slept, gave forth cloudy vapours of depression and disquietude that made impossible the approach of--light.","Starlight, certainly, could not force an entrance, and even sunlight would spill half its radiance before it reached her heart.",The help she needed she thus deliberately shut out.,Before going to bed her mood had been one of anxious care and searching worry.,"It continued, of course, in sleep.","'Now,' thought their leader briskly, 'we must deal with this at once'; and the children, understanding his unspoken message, approached closer to the bed.","How brilliant their little figures were--Jimbo, a soft, pure blue, and Monkey tinged faintly here and there with delicate clear orange.",Thus do the little clouds of sunset gather round to see the sun get into bed.,"And in utter silence; all their intercourse was silent--thought, felt, but never spoken.",For a moment there was hesitation.,Cousinenry was uncertain exactly how to begin.,Tante Jeanne's atmosphere was so very thick he hardly knew the best way to penetrate it.,Her mood had been so utterly black and rayless.,But his hesitation operated like a call for help that flew instantly about the world and was communicated to the golden threads that patterned the outside sky.,"They quivered, flashed the message automatically; the enormous network repeated it as far as England, and the answer came.","For thought is instantaneous, and desire is prayer.",Quick as lightning came the telegram.,Beside them stood a burly figure of gleaming gold.,"'I'll do it,' said the earthy voice.",'I'll show you 'ow.,For she loves 'er garden.,Her sympathy with trees and flowers lets me in.,"Always send for _me_ when she's in a mess, or needs a bit of trimmin' and cleanin' up.'","The Head Gardener pushed past them with his odour of soil and burning leaves, his great sunburned face and his browned, stained hands.","These muscular, big hands he spread above her troubled face; he touched her heart; he blew his windy breath of flowers upon her untidy hair; he called the names of lilac, wistaria, roses, and laburnum....","The room filled with the little rushing music of wind in leaves; and, as he said 'laburnum,' there came at last a sudden opening channel through the fog that covered her so thickly.","Starlight, that was like a rivulet of laburnum blossoms melted into running dew, flowed down it.",The Widow Jequier stirred in her sleep and smiled.,Other channels opened.,"Light trickled down these, too, drawn in and absorbed from the store the Gardener carried.","Then, with a rush of scattering fire, he was gone again.","Out into the enormous sky he flew, trailing golden flame behind him.","They heard him singing as he dived into the Network --singing of buttercups and cowslips, of primroses and marigolds and dandelions, all yellow flowers that have stored up starlight.","And the atmosphere of Tante Jeanne first glowed, then shone; it changed slowly from gloom to glory.","Golden channels opened everywhere, making a miniature network of their own.","Light flashed and corruscated through it, passing from the children and their leader along the tiny pipes of sympathy the Gardener had cleared of rubbish and decay.","Along the very lines of her face ran tiny shining rivers; flooding across her weary eyelids, gilding her untidy hair, and pouring down into her heavy heart.",She ceased fidgeting; she smiled in her sleep; peace settled on her face; her fingers on the coverlet lost their touch of strain.,"Finally she turned over, stretched her old fighting body into a more comfortable position, sighed a moment, then settled down into a deep and restful slumber.","Her atmosphere was everywhere 'soft-shiny' when they left her to shoot next into the attic chamber above, where Miss Waghorn lay among her fragments of broken memory, and the litter of disordered images that passed with her for 'thinking.'","And here, again, although their task was easier, they needed help to show the right way to begin.",Before they reached the room Jimbo had wondered how they would 'get at' her.,That wonder summoned help.,"The tall, thin figure was already operating beside the bed as they entered.","His length seemed everywhere at once, and his slender pole, a star hanging from the end, was busy touching articles on walls and floor and furniture.","The disorder everywhere was the expression of her dishevelled mind, and though he could not build the ruins up again, at least he could trace the outlines of an ordered plan that she might use when she left her body finally and escaped from the rebellious instrument in death.",And now that escape was not so very far away.,Obviously she was already loose.,"She was breaking up, as the world expresses it.","And the children, watching with happy delight, soon understood his method.",Each object that he touched emitted a tiny light.,In her mind he touched the jumble of wandering images as well.,On waking she would find both one and the other better assorted.,Some of the lost things her memory ever groped for she would find more readily.,She would see the starlight on them.,"'See,' said their leader softly, as the long thin figure of the Lamplighter shot away into the night, 'she sleeps so lightly because she is so old--fastened so delicately to the brain and heart.",The fastenings are worn and loose now.,Already she is partly out!',"'That's why she's so muddled in the daytime,' explained Jimbo, for his sister's benefit.","'Exaccurately, I knew it already!'","was the reply, turning a somersault like a wheel of twirling meteors close to the old lady's nose.","'Carefully, now!'",said their leader.,'And hurry up!,"There's not much we can do here, and there's heaps to do elsewhere.","We must remember Mother and Daddy--before the Interfering Sun is up, you know.'","They flashed about the attic chamber, tipping everything with light, from the bundle of clothes that strewed the floor to the confused interior of the black basket-trunk where she kept her money and papers.",There were no shelves in this attic chamber;

each played her role quite admirably.","There were the worthy sterling men who did their duty dumbly, regardless of consequences--Daddy, the Postmaster, and the picturesque old clergyman with failing powers.","There was the dark, uncertain male character, who might be villain, yet who might prove extra hero--the strutting postman of baronial ancestry; there was the role of quaint pathetic humour Miss Waghorn so excellently filled, and there were the honest rough-and-tumble comedians--half mischievous, half malicious--the retired governesses.","Behind them all, brought on chiefly in scenes of dusk and moonlight, were the Forest Elves who, led by Puck, were responsible for the temporary confusion that threatened disaster, yet was bound to have a happy ending--the children.","It was all a children's play set in the lovely scenery of mountain, forest, lake, and old-world garden.",Numerous other characters also flitted in and out.,"There was the cat, the bird, the donkey as in pantomime; goblin caves and haunted valleys and talking flowers; and the queer shadowy folk who came to the Pension in the summer months, then vanished into space again.",Links with the outside world were by no means lacking.,"As in the theatre, one caught now and again the rumble of street traffic and the roar of everyday concerns.","But these fell in by chance during quiet intervals, and served to heighten contrast only.","And so many of the principal roles were almost obviously assumed, interchangeable almost; any day the players might drop their wigs, rub off the paint, and appear otherwise, as they were in private life.","The Widow Jequier's husband, for instance, had been a _pasteur_ who had gone later into the business of a wine-merchant.","She herself was not really the keeper of a Pension for Jeune Filles, but had drifted into it owing to her husband's disastrous descent from pulpit into cellar-- understudy for some one who had forgotten to come on.","The Postmaster, too, had originally been a photographer, whose funereal aspect had sealed his failure in that line.",His customers could never smile and look pleasant.,"The postman, again, was a baron in disguise--in private life he had a castle and retainers; and even Gygi, the gendarme, was a make-believe official who behind the scenes was a _vigneron_ and farmer in a very humble way.","Daddy, too, seemed sometimes but a tinsel author dressed up for the occasion, and absurdly busy over books that no one ever saw on railway bookstalls.","While Mademoiselle Lemaire was not in fact and verity a suffering, patient, bed-ridden lady, but a princess who escaped from her disguise at night into glory and great beneficent splendour.",Mother alone was more real than the other players.,There was no make- believe about Mother.,"She thundered across the stage and stood before the footlights, interrupting many a performance with her stubborn common-sense and her grip upon difficult grave issues.","'This performance will finish at such and such an hour,' was her cry.",'Get your wraps ready.,It will be cold when you go out.,And see that you have money handy for your 'bus fares home!',"Yes, Mother was real.",She knew some facts of life at least.,She knitted the children's stockings and did the family mending.,"Yet Rogers felt, even with her, that she was merely waiting.",She knew the cast was not complete as yet.,She waited.,They all waited--for some one.,These were rehearsals; Rogers himself had dropped in also merely as an understudy.,"Another role was vacant, and it was the principal role.","There was no one in the company who could play it, none who could understudy it even.",Neither Rogers nor Daddy could learn the lines or do the 'business.',"The part was a very important one, calling for a touch of genius to be filled adequately.",And it was a feminine role.,For here was a Fairy Play without a Fairy Queen.,There was not even a Fairy Princess!,"This idea of a representation, all prepared specially for himself, induced a very happy state of mind; he felt restful, calm, at peace with all the world.",He had only to sit in his stall and enjoy.,"But it brought, too, this sense of delicate bewilderment that was continually propounding questions to which he found no immediate answer.","With the rest of the village, he stood still while Time flowed past him.","Later, with Minks, he would run after it and catch it up again.",Minks would pick out the lost clues.,Minks stood on the banks--in London--noting the questions floating by and landing them sometimes with a rod and net.,His master would deal with them by and by;

days were bright and warm; the nights were thick with stars.,Rogers postponed departure on the flimsiest reasons.,It was no easy thing to leave Bourcelles.,'Next week the muguet will be over in the vallon vert.,We must pick it quickly together for Tante Anna.',Jinny brought every spring flower to Mademoiselle Lemaire in this way the moment they appeared.,Her room was a record of their sequence from week to week.,"And Jimbo knew exactly where to find them first;

it was asked with just a hint of shame upon a very puckered little face--'But, Mummy, what really _is_ a sekrity?'","And so Rogers, from day to day, stayed on, enjoying himself and resting.","The City would have called it loafing, but in the City the schedule of values was a different one.",Meanwhile the bewilderment he felt at first gradually disappeared.,"He no longer realised it, that is.","While still outside, attacked by it, he had realised the soft entanglement.","Now he was in it, caught utterly, a prisoner.",He was no longer mere observer.,He was part and parcel of it.,'What does a few weeks matter out of a whole strenuous life?',he argued.,"'It's all to the good, this holiday.",I'm storing up strength and energy for future use.,My Scheme can wait a little.,I'm thinking things out meanwhile.',"He often went into the forest alone to think his things out, and 'things' always meant his Scheme ... but the more he thought about it the more distant and impracticable seemed that wondrous Scheme.","He had the means, the love, the yearning, all in good condition, waiting to be put to practical account.","In his mind, littered more and more now with details that Minks not infrequently sent in, this great Scheme by which he had meant to help the world ran into the confusion of new issues that were continually cropping up.","Most of these were caused by the difficulty of knowing his money spent exactly as he wished, not wasted, no pound of it used for adornment, whether salaries, uniforms, fancy stationery, or unnecessary appearances, whatever they might be.","Whichever way he faced it, and no matter how carefully thought out were the plans that Minks devised, these leakages cropped up and mocked him.","Among a dozen propositions his original clear idea went lost, and floundered.",It came perilously near to wumbling itself away altogether.,"For one thing, there were rivals on the scene--his cousin's family, the education of these growing children, the difficulties of the Widow Jequier, some kind of security he might ensure to old Miss Waghorn, the best expert medical attendance for Mademoiselle Lemaire ... and his fortune was after all a small one as fortunes go.",Only his simple scale of personal living could make these things possible at all.,"Yet here, at least, he would know that every penny went exaccurately where it was meant to go, and accomplished the precise purpose it was intended to accomplish.","And the more he thought about it, the more insistent grew the claims of little Bourcelles, and the more that portentous Scheme for Disabled Thingumabobs faded into dimness.",The old Vicar's words kept singing in his head: 'The world is full of Neighbours.,Bring them all back to Fairyland.',He thought things out in his own way and at his leisure.,He loved to wander alone among the mountains... thinking in this way.,"His thoughts turned to his cousin's family, their expenses, their difficulties, the curious want of harmony somewhere.","For the conditions in which the _famille anglaise_ existed, he had soon discovered, were those of muddle pure and simple, yet of muddle on so large a scale that it was fascinating and even exhilarating.","It must be lovely, he reflected, to live so carelessly.",They drifted.,Chance forces blew them hither and thither as gusts of wind blow autumn leaves.,Five years in a place and then--a gust that blew them elsewhere.,"Thus they had lived five years in a London suburb, thinking it permanent; five years in a lonely Essex farm, certain they would never abandon country life; and five years, finally, in the Jura forests.","Neither parent, though each was estimable, worthy, and entirely of good repute, had the smallest faculty for seeing life whole; each studied closely a small fragment of it, the fragment limited by the Monday and the Saturday of next week, or, in moments of optimistic health, the fragment that lies between the first and thirty-first of a single month.","Of what lay beyond, they talked; oh, yes, they talked voluminously and with detail that sounded impressive to a listener, but somehow in circles that carried them no further than the starting- point, or in spirals that rose higher with each sentence and finally lifted them bodily above the solid ground.",It was merely talk-- ineffective--yet the kind that makes one feel it has accomplished something and so brings the false security of carelessness again.,Neither one nor other was head of the house.,"They took it in turns, each slipping by chance into that onerous position, supported but uncoveted by the other.","Mother fed the children, mended everything, sent them to the dentist when their teeth ached badly, but never before as a preventative, and--trusted to luck.","'Daddy,' she would say in her slow gentle way, 'I do wish we could be more practical sometimes.","Life is such a business, isn't it?'","And they would examine in detail the grain of the stable door now that the horse had escaped, then close it very carefully.","'I really must keep books,' he would answer, 'so that we can see exactly how we stand,' having discovered at the end of laborious calculation concerning the cost of the proposed Geneva schooling for Jinny that they had reckoned in shillings instead of francs.","And then, with heads together, they selected for their eldest boy a profession utterly unsuited to his capacities, with coaching expenses far beyond their purses, and with the comforting consideration that 'there's a pension attached to it, you see, for when he's old.'","Similarly, having planned minutely, and with personal sacrifice, to save five francs in one direction, they would spend that amount unnecessarily in another.","They felt they had it to spend, as though it had been just earned and already jingled in their pockets.",Daddy would announce he was walking into Neuchatel to buy tobacco.,"'Better take the tram,' suggested Mother, 'it's going to rain.","You save shoe leather, too,' she added laughingly.",'Will you be back to tea?',He thought not; he would get a cup of tea in town.,"'May I come, too?'",from Jimbo.,'Why not?',thought Mother.,"'Take him with you, he'll enjoy the trip.'","Monkey and Jane Ann, of course, went too.","They _all_ had tea in a shop, and bought chocolate into the bargain.","The  five francs melted into--nothing, for tea at home was included in their Pension terms.",Saving is in the mind.,There was no system in their life.,"'It would be jolly, yes, if you could earn a little something regular besides your work,' agreed Mother, when he thought of learning a typewriter to copy his own books, and taking in work to copy for others too.","'I'll do it,' he decided with enthusiasm that was forgotten before he left the room ten minutes later.",It was the same with the suggestion of teaching English.,"He had much spare time, and could easily have earned a pound a week by giving lessons, and a pound a week is fifty pounds a year--enough to dress the younger children easily.",The plan was elaborated laboriously.,"'Of course,' agreed Daddy, with genuine interest.",'It's easily done.,I wonder we never thought of it before.',"Every few months they talked about it, but it never grew an inch nearer to accomplishment.","They drifted along, ever in difficulty, each secretly blaming the other, yet never putting their thoughts into speech.",They did not quite understand each other's point of view.,'Mother really might have foreseen _that_!',"when Jimbo, growing like a fairy beanstalk, rendered his recent clothes entirely useless.",'Boys must grow.,Why didn't she buy the things a size or two larger?',"'It's rather thoughtless, almost selfish, of Daddy to go on writing these books that bring in praise without money.",He could write anything if he chose.,"At least, he might put his shoulder to the wheel and teach, or something!'","And so, not outwardly in spoken words or quarrels, but inwardly, owing to that deadliest of cancers, want of sympathy, these two excellent grown-up children had moved with the years further and further apart.","Love had not died, but want of understanding, not attended to in time, had frayed the edges so that they no longer fitted well together.","They have blown in here, thought Rogers as he watched them, like seeds the wind has brought.",They have taken root and grown a bit.,"They think they're here for ever, but presently a wind will rise and blow them off again elsewhere.","And thinking it is their own act, they will look wisely at each other, as children do, and say, 'Yes, it _is_ time now to make a move.",The children are getting big.,"Our health, too, needs a change.'","He wondered, smiling a little, in what vale or mountain top the wind would let them down.",And a big decision blazed up in his heart.,"'I'm not very strong in the domestic line,' he exclaimed, 'but I think I can help them a bit.",They're neighbours at any rate.,They're all children too.,"Daddy's no older than Jimbo, or Mother than Jane Anne!'",* * * In the spaces of the forest there was moss and sunshine.,It was very still.,The primroses and anemones had followed the hepaticas and periwinkles.,Patches of lily of the valley filled the air with fragrance.,"Through openings of the trees he caught glimpses of the lake, deep as the Italian blue of the sky above his head.",White Alps hung in the air beyond its farther shore line.,"Below him, already far away, the village followed slowly, bringing its fields and vineyards with it, until the tired old church called halt.","And then it lay back, nestling down to sleep, very small, very cosy, mere handful of brown roofs among the orchards.","Only the blue smoke of occasional peat fires moved here and there, betraying human occupation.","The peace and beauty sank into his heart, as he wandered higher across Mont Racine's velvet shoulder.",And the contrast stirred memories of his recent London life.,"He thought of the scurrying busy-bodies in the 'City,' and he thought of the Widow Jequier attacking life so restlessly in her garden at that very minute.",That other sentence of the old Vicar floated though his mind: 'the grandeur of toil and the insignificance of acquisition.'...,"Far overhead two giant buzzards circled quietly, ceaselessly watching from the blue.",A brimstone butterfly danced in random flight before his face.,Two cuckoos answered one another in the denser forest somewhere above him.,"Bells from distant village churches boomed softly through the air, voices from a world forgotten.",And the contrast brought back London.,He thought of the long busy chapter of his life just finished.,The transition had been so abrupt.,"As a rule periods fade into one another gradually in life, easily, divisions blurred;

shirts, collars, boots, gloves, and--oh, _toute sorte de choses comme ca_.'","'Isn't it nice of 'em,' repeated Daddy.",It made life easier for him-- ever so much easier.,'A family like that has such heaps of things.,And they always pay the freight.,It saves me a pretty penny I can tell you.,"Why, I haven't bought the girls a dress for two years or more.","And Edward's dressed like a lord, I tell you,' referring to his eldest boy now at an expensive tutor's.",'You can understand the excitement when a box arrives.,We call it the Magic Box.',Rogers understood.,"It had puzzled him before why the children's clothes, Daddy's and Mummy's as well for that matter, were such an incongruous assortment of village or peasant wear, and smart, well-cut garments that bore so obviously the London mark.","'They're very rich indeed,' said Jimbo.",'They have a motor car.,These are the only things that don't fit them.,There's not much for me usually; I'm too little yet.,But there's lots for the girls and the others.',"And 'the others,' it appeared, included the Widow Jequier, the Postmaster and his wife, the carpenter's family, and more than one household in the village who knew the use and value of every centimetre of ribbon.",Even the retired governesses got their share.,No shred or patch was ever thrown away as useless.,The assortment of cast-off clothing furnished Sunday Bests to half the village for weeks to come.,A consignment of bullion could not have given half the pleasure and delight that the arrival of a box produced.,"But _midi_ was ringing, and _dejeuner_ had to be eaten first.","Like a meal upon the stage, no one ate sincerely; they made a brave pretence, but the excitement was too great for hunger.",Every one was in the secret--the Postmaster (he might get another hat out of it for himself) had let it out with a characteristic phrase: 'Il y a un paquet pour la famille anglaise!',Yet all feigned ignorance.,"The children exchanged mysterious glances, and afterwards the governesses hung about the Post Office, simulating the purchase of stamps at two o'clock.","But every one watched Daddy's movements, for he it was who would say the significant words.",And at length he said them.,"'Now, we had better go down to the station,' he observed casually, 'and see if there is anything for us.'",His tone conveyed the impression that things often arrived in this way; it was an everyday affair.,"If there was nothing, it didn't matter much.",His position demanded calmness.,"'Very well,' said Jimbo.",'I'll come with you.',"He strutted off, leading the way.","'And I, and I,' cried Monkey and Jane Anne, for it was a half-holiday and all were free.",Jimbo would not have appeared to hurry for a kingdom.,"'I think I'll join you, too,' remarked Mother, biting her lips, 'only please go slowly.'",There were hills to negotiate.,"They went off together in a party, and the governesses watched them go.","The Widow Jequier put her head out of the window, pretending she was feeding the birds.",Her sister popped out opportunely to post a letter.,"The Postmaster opened his _guichet_ window and threw a bit of string into the gutter; and old Miss Waghorn, just then appearing for her daily fifteen minutes' constitutional, saw the procession and asked him, 'Who in the world all those people were?'",She had completely forgotten them.,"'Le barometre a monte,' he replied, knowing no word of English, and thinking it was her usual question about the weather.",He reported daily the state of the barometer.,'Vous n'aurez pas besoin d'un parapluie.',"'Mercy,' she said, meaning _merci_.","The train arrived, and with it came the box.",They brought it up themselves upon the little hand-cart--_le char_.,"It might have weighed a ton and contained priceless jewels, the way they tugged and pushed, and the care they lavished on it.","Mother puffed behind, hoping there would be something to fit Jimbo this time.",'Shall we rest a moment?',"came at intervals on the hill, till at last Monkey said, 'Sit on the top, Mummy, and we'll pull you too.'","And during the rests they examined the exterior, smelt it, tapped it, tried to see between the cracks, and ventured endless and confused conjectures as to its probable contents.","They dragged the hand-cart over the cobbles of the courtyard, and heaved the box up the long stone staircase.",It was planted at length on the floor beside the bed of Mlle.,"Lemaire, that she might witness the scene from her prison windows.","Daddy had the greatest difficulty in keeping order, for tempers grow short when excitement is too long protracted.",The furniture was moved about to make room.,Orders flew about like grape-shot.,Everybody got in everybody else's way.,"But finally the unwieldy packing-case was in position, and a silence fell upon the company.","'My gum, we've put it upside down,' said Daddy, red in the face with his exertions.",It was the merest chance that there was no wisp of straw yet in his beard.,"'Then the clothes will all be inside out,' cried Monkey, 'and we shall have to stand on our heads.'","'You silly,' Jane Anne rebuked her, yet half believing it was true, while Jimbo, holding hammer and chisel ready, looked unutterable contempt.",'Can't you be serious for a moment?',said his staring blue eyes.,"The giant chest was laboriously turned over, the two men straining every muscle in the attempt.","Then, after a moment's close inspection again to make quite sure, Daddy spoke gravely.","Goodness, how calm he was!","'Jimbo, boy, pass me the hammer and the chisel, will you?'",In breathless silence the lid was slowly forced open and the splintered pieces gingerly removed.,Sheets of dirty brown paper and bundles of odorous sacking came into view.,"'Perhaps that's all there is,' suggested Jinny.",'Ugh!,What a whiff!',said Monkey.,"'Fold them up carefully and put them in a corner,' ordered Mother.",Jane Anne religiously obeyed.,"Oh dear, how slow she was about it!","Then everybody came up very close, heads bent over, hands began to stretch and poke.",You heard breathing--nothing more.,"'Now, wait your turn,' commanded Mother in a dreadful voice, 'and let your Father try on everything first.'",And a roar of laughter made the room echo while Daddy extracted wonder after wonder that were packed in endless layers one upon another.,Perhaps what would have struck an observer most of all would have been the strange seriousness against which the comedy was set.,"The laughter was incessant, but it was a weighty matter for all that.","The bed- ridden woman, who was sole audience, understood that; the parents understood it too.","Every article of clothing that could be worn meant a saving, and the economy of a franc was of real importance.",The struggles of _la famille anglaise_ to clothe and feed and educate themselves were no light affair.,"The eldest boy, now studying for the consular service, absorbed a third of their entire income.",The sacrifices involved for his sake affected each one in countless ways.,And for two years now these magic boxes had supplied all his suits and shirts and boots.,The Scotch cousins luckily included a boy of his own size who had extravagant taste in clothes.,A box sometimes held as many as four excellent suits.,Daddy contented himself with one a year --ordered ready-made from the place they called Chasbakerinhighholborn.',Mother's clothes were 'wropp in mystery' ever.,No one ever discovered where they came from or how she made them.,She did.,It seemed always the same black dress and velvet blouse.,"Gravity and laughter, therefore, mingled in Daddy's face as he drew out one paper parcel after another, opened it, tried the article on himself, and handed it next to be tried on similarly by every one in turn.",And the first extraction from the magic box was a curious looking thing that no one recognised.,Daddy unfolded it and placed it solemnly on his head.,"He longed for things for himself, but rarely found them.","He tried on everything, hoping it might 'just do,' but in the end yielded it with pleasure to the others.",He rarely got more than a pair of gloves or a couple of neckties for himself.,The coveted suits just missed his size.,Grave as a judge he balanced the erection on his head.,It made a towering heap.,Every one was puzzled.,"'It's a motor cap,' ventured some one at length in a moment of intuition.",'It's several!',cried Monkey.,She snatched the bundle and handed it to Mother.,"There were four motor caps, neatly packed together.",Mother put on each in turn.,They were in shades of grey.,They became her well.,"'You look like a duchess,' said Daddy proudly.",'You'd better keep them all.',"'I think perhaps they'll do,' she said, moving to the glass, 'if no one else can wear them.'",She flushed a little and looked self- conscious.,"'They want long pins,' suggested Jinny.","'They'll keep the rain off too, like an umbrella.'",She laughed and clapped her hands.,Mother pinned one on and left it there for the remainder of the afternoon.,The unpacking of the case continued.,The next discovery was gloves.,The lid of the box looked like a counter in a glove shop.,"There were gloves of leather and chamois, gauntlets, driving-gloves, and gloves of suede, yellow, brown, and grey.","All had been used a little, but all were good.","'They'll wash,' said Jane Anne.",They were set aside in a little heap apart.,No one coveted them.,It was not worth while.,"In the forests of Bourcelles gloves were at a discount, and driving a pleasure yet unknown.","Jinny, however a little later put on a pair of ladies' suede that caught her fancy, and wore them faithfully to the end of the performance, just to keep her mother's motor cap in countenance.","The main contents of the box were as yet unbroached, however, and when next an overcoat appeared, with velvet collar and smart, turned-up cuffs, Daddy beamed like a boy and was into it before any one could prevent.",He went behind a screen.,"The coat obviously did not fit him, but he tugged and pulled and wriggled his shoulders with an air of 'things that won't fit must be made to fit.'",'You'll bust the seams!,You'll split the buttons!,See what's in the pockets!',"cried several voices, while he shifted to and fro like a man about to fight.","'It may stretch,' he said hopefully.",'I think I can use it.,It's just what I want.',"He glanced up at his wife whose face, however, was relentless.","'Maybe,' replied the practical mother, 'but it's more Edward's build, perhaps.'","He looked fearfully disappointed, but kept it on.",Edward got the best of every box.,"He went on with the unpacking, giving the coat sly twitches from time to time, as he pulled out blouses, skirts, belts, queer female garments, boots, soft felt hats--the green Homburg he put on at once, as who should dare to take it from him--black and brown Trilbys, shooting-caps, gaiters, flannel shirts, pyjamas, and heaven knows what else besides.","The excitement was prodigious, and the floor looked like a bargain sale.",Everybody talked at once; there was no more pretence of keeping order Mlle.,"Lemaire lay propped against her pillows, watching the scene with feelings between tears and laughter.","Each member of the family tried on everything in turn, but yielded the treasures instantly at a word from Mother--'That will do for so and so; this will fit Monkey; Jimbo, you take this,' and so on.","The door into the adjoining bedroom was for ever opening and shutting, as the children disappeared with armfuls and reappeared five minutes later, marvellously apparelled.",There was no attempt at sorting yet.,Blouses and flannel trousers lay upon the floor with boots and motor veils.,"Every one had something, and the pile set aside for Edward grew apace.",Only Jimbo was disconsolate.,He was too small for everything; even the ladies' boots were too narrow and too pointed for his little feet.,From time to time he rummaged with the hammer and chisel (still held _very_ tightly) among the mass of paper at the bottom.,"But, as usual, there was nothing but gaudy neckties that he could use.",And these he did not care about.,"He said no word, but stood there watching the others and trying to laugh, only keeping the tears back with the greatest difficulty.",From his position in the background Rogers took it all in.,He moved up and slipped a ten-franc piece into the boy's hand.,"'Secretaries don't wear clothes like this,' he whispered.",'We'll go into town to-morrow and get the sort of thing you want.',Jimbo looked up and stared.,He stood on tip-toe to kiss him.,"'Oh, thank you so much,' he said, fearful lest the others should see; and tucked the coin away into a pocket underneath his cotton blouse.",A moment later he came back from the corner where he had hid himself to examine it.,"'But, Cousin Henry,' he whispered, utterly astonished, 'it's gold.'",He had thought the coin was a ten-centime piece such as Daddy sometimes gave him.,He could not believe it.,He had never seen gold before.,He ran up and told his parents.,His sisters were too excited to be told just then.,"After that he vanished into the passage without being noticed, and when he returned five minutes later his eyes were suspiciously red.",But no one heard him say a word about getting nothing out of the box.,"He stood aside, with a superior manner and looked quietly on.","'It's very nice for the girls,' his expression said.",His  interest in the box had grown decidedly less.,He could buy an entire shop for himself now.,"'Mother, Daddy, everybody,' cried an excited voice, 'will you look at me a minute, please!","It all fits me perfectly,' and Jinny emerged from the bedroom door.",She had been trying on.,"A rough brown dress of Harris tweed became her well; she wore a motor veil about her head, and another was tied round her neck; a white silk blouse, at least one size too large for her, bulged voluminously from beneath the neat tweed jacket.",She wore her suede gloves still.,"'And there's an outside pocket in the skirt, you see.'",She pulled it up and showed a very pointed pair of brown boots; they were much too long; they looked ridiculous after her square village boots.,"'I can waggle my toes in them,' she explained, strutting to and fro to be admired.",'I'm a fashionable monster now!',"But she only held the centre of the stage a minute, for Monkey entered at her heels, bursting with delight in a long green macintosh thrown over another tweed skirt that hid her feet and even trailed behind.",A pair of yellow spats were visible sometimes that spread fan-shaped over her boots and climbed half-way up the fat legs.,"'It all fits me exaccurately,' was her opinion.","The sisters went arm in arm about the room, dancing and laughing.","'We're busy blackmailers,' cried Jinny, using her latest acquisition which she practised on all possible occasions.","'We're in Piccadilly, going to see the Queen for tea.'",They tripped over Monkey's train and one of the spats came off in the struggle for recovery.,"Daddy, in his Homburg hat, looked round and told them sternly to make less noise.",Behind a screen he was getting surreptitiously into a suit that Mother had put aside for Edward.,"He tried on several in this way, hopeful to the last.","'I think this will fit me all right,' he said presently, emerging with a grave expression on his puckered face.",He seemed uncertain about it.,He was solemn as a judge.,"'You could alter the buttons here and there, you know,' and he looked anxiously at his wife.","The coat ran up behind, the waistcoat creased badly owing to the strain, and the trousers were as tight as those of a cavalry officer.","Anywhere, and any moment, he might burst out into unexpected revelation.","'A little alteration,' he suggested hopefully, 'and it would be all right--don't you think?'",And then he added 'perhaps.',He turned and showed himself.,Even the roar of laughter that greeted his appearance did not quite convince him.,"He looked like a fat, impoverished bookmaker.","'I think it will fit Edward better,' said Mother again without pity, for she did not like to see her husband look foolish before the children.","He disappeared behind the screen, but repeated the performance with two other suits.","'This striped one seems a little looser,' he said; or, 'If you'd let out the trousers at the bottom, I think they would do.'","But in the end all he got from the box was two pairs of pink silk pyjamas, the Homburg hat, several pairs of gloves, spats, and gaiters, and half a dozen neckties that no one else would wear.","He made his heap carefully in the corner of the room, and later, when the mess was all cleared up and everybody went off with their respective treasures, he entirely forgot them in his pleasure and admiration of the others.",He left them lying in the corner.,"Riquette slept on them that night, and next morning Jimbo brought them over for him to the carpenter's house.",And Edward later magnanimously yielded up two flannel shirts because he had so many left over from the previous box.,Also a pair of pumps.,"'I've not done so badly after all,' was his final matured opinion.",'Poor mother!,She got nothing but motor caps.',"Jimbo, however, had made a final discovery of value for himself--of some value, at least.","When the empty case was overturned as a last hope, he rummaged among the paper with his hammer and chisel, and found four pairs of golf stockings!","The legs fitted him admirably, but the feet were much too big.",There was some discussion as to whether they had belonged to a very thin-legged boy with big feet or to a girl who had no calves.,"Luckily, the former was decided upon, for otherwise they would have given no pleasure to Jimbo.","Even as it was, he adopted them chiefly because it pleased his parents.",Mother cut off the feet and knitted new ones a little smaller.,But there was no mystery about those stockings.,No special joy went with them.,He had watched Mother knitting too often for that; she could make stockings half asleep.,"Two hours later, while Jane Ann and Mother prepared the tea in the Den, Daddy, Jimbo, and Cousin Henry went in a procession to the carpenter's house carrying the piles of clothing in their arms to the astonishment of half the village.","They were to be re-sorted there in privacy by the 'men,' where the 'children' could not interfere.","The things they could not use were distributed later among the governesses; the Pension and the village also, got their share.",And the Postmaster got his hat--a black Trilby.,He loved its hue.,And for days afterwards the children hoarded their treasures with unholy joy.,"What delighted them as much as anything, perhaps, were the coronets upon the pyjamas and the shirts.",They thought it was a London or Edinburgh laundry mark.,"But Jimbo told them otherwise: 'It means that Daddy's Cousin is a Lord-and-Waiting, and goes to see the King.'",This explanation was generally accepted.,"The relief to the parents, however, as they sat up in the Den that night and discussed how much this opportune Magic Box had saved them, may be better imagined than described.","The sum ran into many, many francs.",Edward had suits now for at least two years.,"'He's stopped growing,' said his mother; 'thank goodness,' said his father.","And to the long list he prayed for twice a day Jimbo added of his accord, 'Ceux qui ont envoye la grosse caisse.'","CHAPTER XX      Break up the heavens, O Lord!","and far,      Thro' all yon starlight keen,      Draw me, thy bride, a glittering star,      In raiment white and clean.","He lifts me to the golden doors;      The flashes come and go;      All heaven bursts her starry floors,      And strews her lights below.",_St.,"Agnes' Eve, Tennyson_.","Miss Waghorn, of late, had been unusually trying, and especially full of complaints.",Her poor old memory seemed broken beyond repair.,"She offered Madame Jequier her weekly payment twice within ten minutes, and was quite snappy about it when the widow declined the second tender.","'But you had the receipt in your hand wizin ten minutes ago, Mees Wag'orn.",You took it upstairs.,The ink can hardly be now already yet dry.',But nothing would satisfy her that she had paid until they went up to her room together and found it after much searching between her Bible and her eternal novel on the writing-table.,"'Forgive me, Madame, but you do forget sometimes, don't you?'",she declared with amusing audacity.,'I like to make quite sure--- especially where money is concerned.',On entering the room she had entirely forgotten why they came there.,"She began complaining, instead, about the bed, which had not yet been made.","A standing source of grumbling, this; for the old lady would come down to breakfast many a morning, and then go up again before she had it, thinking it was already late in the day.","She worried the _pensionnaires_ to death, too.","It was their duty to keep the salon tidy, and Miss Waghorn would flutter into the room as early as eight o'clock, find the furniture still unarranged, and at once dart out again to scold the girls.","These interviews were amusing before they became monotonous, for the old lady's French was little more than 'nong pas' attached to an infinitive verb, and the girls' Swiss-German explanations of the alleged neglect of duty only confused her.","'Nong pas faire la chambre,' she would say, stamping her foot with vexation.","'You haven't done the room, though it's nearly dejooner time!'",Or else--'Ten minutes ago it was tidy.,Look at it now!',"while she dragged them in and forced them to put things straight, until some one in authority came and explained gently her mistake.","'Oh, excuse me, Madame,' she would say then, 'but they do forget _so_ often.'",Every one was very patient with her as a rule.,"And of late she had been peculiarly meddlesome, putting chairs straight, moving vases, altering the lie of table-cloths and the angle of sofas, opening windows because it was 'so stuffy,' and closing them a minute later with complaints about the draught, forcing occupants of arm-chairs to get up because the carpet was caught, fiddling with pictures because they were crooked either with floor or ceiling, and never realising that in the old house these latter were nowhere parallel.","But her chief occupation was to prevent the children crossing their legs when they sat down, or pulling their dresses lower, with a whispered, 'You _must_ not cross your legs like that; it isn't ladylike, dear.'",She had been very exasperating and interfering.,Tempers had grown short.,Twice running she had complained about the dreadful noise the _pensionnaires_ made at seven o'clock in the morning.,'Nong pas creer comme ca!',"she called, running down the passage in her dressing-gown and bursting angrily into their rooms without knocking--to find them empty.",The girls had left the day before.,"But to-day (the morning after the Star Cave adventure) the old lady was calmer, almost soothed, and at supper she was composed and gentle.","Sleep, for some reason, had marvellously refreshed her.","Attacks that opened as usual about Cornish Cream or a Man with a long Beard, she repelled easily and quietly.","'I've told you that story before, my dear; I know I have.'",It seemed her mind and memory were more orderly somehow.,And the Widow Jequier explained how sweet and good-natured she had been all day--better than for years.,'When I took her drops upstairs at eleven o'clock I found her tidying her room; she was sorting her bills and papers.,She read me a letter she had written to her nephew to come out and take her home--well written and quite coherent.,I've not known her mind so clear for months.,"Her memory, too.",She said she had slept so well.,"If only it would last, _helas_!'","'There _are_ days like that,' she added presently, 'days when everything goes right and easily.",One wakes up happy in the morning and sees only the bright side of things.,"Hope is active, and one has new courage somehow.'","She spoke with feeling, her face was brighter, clearer, her mind less anxious.",She had planned a visit to the Bank Manager about the mortgages.,It had come as an inspiration.,"It might be fruitless, but she was hopeful, and so knew a little peace.","'I wonder why it is,' she added, 'and what brings these changes into the heart so suddenly.'","'Good sleep and sound digestion,' Mrs. Campden thought.",She expressed her views deliberately like this in order to counteract any growth of fantasy in the children.,"'But it is strange,' her husband said, remembering his new story; 'it may be much deeper than that.",While the body sleeps the spirit may get into touch with helpful forces----' His French failed him.,He wumbled painfully.,"'Thought-forces possibly from braver minds,' put in Rogers.",'Who knows?,Sleep and dreaming have never really been explained.',He recalled a theory of Minks.,"'_I_ dream a great deal,' Miss Waghorn observed, eager to take part.","'It's delightful, dreaming--if only one could remember!'",She looked round the table with challenge in her eager old eyes.,But no one took her up.,It involved such endless repetition of well-known stories.,"The Postmaster might have said a word--he looked prepared--but, not understanding English, he went on with his salad instead.","'Life is a dream,' observed Monkey, while Jinny seemed uncertain whether she should laugh or take it seriously.",The Widow Jequier overheard her.,There was little she did not overhear.,'Coquine!',"she said, then quoted with a sentimental sigh:--      La vie est breve,      Un peu d'amour.",Un peu de rive      Et puis--bonjour!,She hung her head sideways a moment for effect.,There was a pause all down the long table.,"'I'm sure dreams have significance,' she went on.",'There's more in dreaming than one thinks.,They come as warnings or encouragement.,All the saints had dreams.,I always pay attention to mine.',"'Madame, _I_ dream a great deal,' repeated Miss Waghorn, anxious not to be left out of a conversation in which she understood at least the key-word _reve_; 'a very great deal, I may say.'","Several looked up, ready to tell nightmares of their own at the least sign of encouragement.","The Postmaster faced the table, laying down his knife and fork.",He took a deep breath.,This time he meant to have his say.,But his deliberation always lost him openings.,"_I_ don't,' exclaimed Jinny, bluntly, five minutes behind the others.","'When I'm in bed, I sleep.'",The statement brought laughter that confused her a little.,She loved to define her position.,She had defined it.,And the Postmaster had lost his chance.,Mlle.,"Sandoz, a governess who was invited to supper as payment for a music lesson given to his boy, seized the opening.",'Last night I dreamed that a bull chased me.,"Now what did _that_ mean, I wonder?'",'That there was no danger since it was only a dream!',"said the Postmaster sharply, vexed that he had not told his own.","But no one applauded, for it was the fashion to ignore his observations, unless they had to do with stamps and weights of letters, parcels, and the like.","A clatter of voices rose, as others, taking courage, decided to tell experiences of their own; but it was the Postmaster's wife in the hall who won.","She had her meals outside with the kitchen maid and her niece, who helped in the Post Office, and she always tried to take part in the conversation from a distance thus.","She plunged into a wordy description of a lengthy dream that had to do with clouds, three ravens, and a mysterious face.","All listened, most of them in mere politeness, for as cook she was a very important personage who could furnish special dishes on occasion--but her sister listened as to an oracle.","She nodded her head and made approving gestures, and said, 'Aha, you see,' or 'Ah, voila!'","as though that helped to prove the importance of the dream, if not its actual truth.",And the sister came to the doorway so that no one could escape.,"She stood there in her apron, her face hot and flushed still from the kitchen.","At length it came to an end, and she looked round her, hoping for a little sympathetic admiration, or at least for expressions of wonder and interest.",All waited for some one else to speak.,"Into the pause came her husband's voice, 'Je n'ai pas de sel.'",There was no resentment.,It was an everyday experience.,The spell was broken instantly.,The cook retired to her table and told the dream all over again with emphatic additions to her young companions.,The Postmaster got his salt and continued eating busily as though dreams were only fit for women and children to talk about.,And the English group began whispering excitedly of their Magic Box and all it had contained.,They were tired of dreams and dreaming.,"Tante Jeanne made a brave effort to bring the conversation back to the key of sentiment and mystery she loved, but it was not a success.","'At any rate I'm certain one's mood on going to bed decides the kind of dream that comes,' she said into the air.",'The last thought before going to sleep is very important.,It influences the adventures of the soul when it leaves the body every night.',"For this was a tenet of her faith, although she always forgot to act upon it.","Only Miss Waghorn continued the train of ideas this started, with a coherence that surprised even herself.","Somehow the jabber about dreams, though in a language that only enabled her to catch its general drift, had interested her uncommonly.",She seemed on the verge of remembering something.,"She had listened with patience, a look of peace upon her anxious old face that was noticed even by Jane Anne.","'It smoothed her out,' was her verdict afterwards, given only to herself though.","'Everything is a sort of long unfinished dream to her, I suppose, at _that_ age.'","While the _famille anglaise_ renewed noisily their excitement of the Magic Box, and while the talk in the hall went on and on, re-hashing the details of the cook's marvellous experience, and assuming entirely new proportions, Miss Waghorn glanced about her seeking whom she might devour--and her eye caught Henry Rogers, listening as usual in silence.","'Ah,' she said to him, 'but _I_ look forward to sleep.",I might say I long for it.',She sighed very audibly.,"It was both a sigh for release and a faint remembrance that last night her sleep had been somehow deep and happy, strangely comforting.","'It is welcome sometimes, isn't it?'","he answered, always polite and rather gentle with her.","'Sleep unravels, yes,' she said, vaguely as to context, yet with a querulous intensity.",It was as if she caught at the enthusiasm of a connected thought somewhere.,"'I might even say it unties,' she added, encouraged by his nod, 'unties knots--if you follow me.'","'It does, Miss Waghorn.","Indeed, it does.'","Was this a precursor of the Brother with the Beard, he wondered?",'Untied knots' would inevitably start her off.,He made up his mind to listen to the tale with interest for the twentieth time if it came.,But it didn't come.,"'I am very old and lonely, and _I_ need the best,' she went on happily, half saying it to herself.",Instantly he took her up--without surprise too.,It was like a dream.,'Quite so.,"The rest, the common stuff----' 'Is good enough----' she chimed in quickly-- 'For Fraulein, or for baby, or for mother,' he laughed.","'Or any other,' chuckled Miss Waghorn.",'Who needs a bit of sleep----' 'But yet can do without it----' she carried it on.,"Then both together, after a second's pause-- 'If they must----' and burst out laughing.","Goodness, how did _she_ know the rhyme?",Was it everywhere?,Was thought running loose like wireless messages to be picked up by all who were in tune for acceptance?,"'Well, I never!'","he heard her exclaim, 'if that's not a nursery rhyme of my childhood that I've not heard for sixty years and more!","I declare,' she added with innocent effrontery, 'I've not heard it since I was ten years old.",And I was born in '37--the year----' 'Just fancy!',he tried to stop her.,'Queen Victoria came to the throne.',"'Strange,' he said more to himself than to any one else.",She did not contradict him.,'You or me?',"asked Monkey, who overheard.","'All of us,' he answered.",'We all think the same things.,"It's a dream, I believe; the whole thing is a dream.'","'It's a fact though,' said Miss Waghorn with decision, 'and now I must go and write my letters, and then finish a bit of lace I'm doing.",You will excuse me?',"She rose, made a little bow, and left the table.",Mother watched her go.,'What _has_ come over the old lady?',she thought.,'She seems to be getting back her mind and memory too.,How very odd!',In the afternoon Henry Rogers had been into Neuchatel.,It seemed he had some business there of a rather private nature.,"He was very mysterious about it, evading several offers to accompany him, and after supper he retired early to his own room in the carpenter's house.","And, since he now was the principal attraction, a sort of magnet that drew the train of younger folk into his neighbourhood, the Pension emptied, and the English family, deprived of their leader, went over to the Den.","'Partir a l'anglaise,' laughed the Widow Jequier, as she saw them file away downstairs; and then she sighed.","Some day, when the children were older and needed a different education, they would all go finally.",Down these very stairs they would go into the street.,"She loved them for themselves, but, also, the English family was a permanent source of income to her, and the chief.","They stayed on in the winter, when boarders were few and yet living expenses doubled.","She sighed, and fluttered into her tiny room to take her finery off, finery that had once been worn in Scotland and had reached her by way of Cook and _la petite vitesse_ in the Magic Box.",And presently she fluttered out again and summoned her sister.,The Postmaster had gone to bed; the kitchen girl was washing up the last dishes; Miss Waghorn would hardly come down again.,The salon was deserted.,"'Come, Anita,' she cried, yet with a hush of excitement in her voice, 'we will have an evening of it.","Bring the _soucoupe_ with you, while I prepare the little table.'",In her greasy kitchen apron Anita came.,"Zizi, her boy, came with her.","Madame Jequier, with her flowing garment that was tea-gown, garden-dress, and dressing-gown all in one, looked really like a witch, her dark hair all askew and her eyes shining with mysterious anticipation.","'We'll ask the spirits for help and guidance,' she said to herself, lest the boy should overhear.","For Zizi often helped them with their amateur planchette, only they told him it was electricity: _le magnetisme_, _le fluide_, was the term they generally made use of.",Its vagueness covered all possible explanations with just the needed touch of confusion and suggestion in it.,"They settled down in a corner of the room, where the ivy from the ceiling nearly touched their heads.","The small round table was produced; the saucer, with an arrow pencilled on its edge, was carefully placed upon the big sheet of paper which bore the letters of the alphabet and the words _oui_ and _non_ in the corners.","The light behind them was half veiled by ivy; the rest of the old room lay in comparative darkness; through the half-opened door a lamp shone upon the oil-cloth in the hall, showing the stains and the worn, streaked patches where the boards peeped through.",The house was very still.,"They began with a little prayer--to _ceux qui ecoutent_,--and then each of them placed a finger on the rim of the upturned saucer, waiting in silence.","They were a study in darkness, those three pointing fingers.","'Zizi, tu as beaucoup de fluide ce soir, oui?'",whispered the widow after a considerable interval.,"'Oh, comme d'habitude,' he shrugged his shoulders.","He loved these mysterious experiments, but he never claimed much _fluide_ until the saucer moved, jealous of losing his reputation as a storehouse of this strange, human electricity.","Yet behind this solemn ritual, that opened with prayer and invariably concluded with hope renewed and courage strengthened, ran the tragic element that no degree of comedy could kill.","In the hearts of the two old women, ever fighting their uphill battle with adversity, burned the essence of big faith, the faith that plays with mountains.","Hidden behind the curtain, an indulgent onlooker might have smiled, but tears would have wet his eyes before the smile could have broadened into laughter.","Tante Jeanne, indeed, _had_ heard that the subconscious mind was held to account for the apparent intelligence that occasionally betrayed itself in the laboriously spelled replies; she even made use of the word from time to time to baffle Zizi's too importunate inquiries.","But after _le subconscient_ she always tacked on _fluide_, _magnetisme_, or _electricite_ lest he should be frightened, or she should lose her way.",And of course she held to her belief that spirits produced the phenomena.,A subconscious mind was a cold and comfortless idea.,"And, as usual, the saucer told them exactly what they had desired to know, suggested ways and means that hid already in the mind of one or other, yet in stammered sentences that included just enough surprise or turn of phrase to confirm their faith and save their self-respect.","It was their form of prayer, and with whole hearts they prayed.","Moreover, they acted on what was told them.","Had they discovered that it was merely the content of their subconscious mind revealing thus its little hopes and fears, they would have lost their chief support in life.",God and religion would have suffered a damaging eclipse.,Big scaffolding in their lives would have collapsed.,"Doubtless, Tante Jeanne did not knowingly push the saucer, neither did the weighty index finger of the concentrated cook deliberately exert muscular pressure.","Nor, similarly, was Zizi aware that the weight of his entire hand helped to urge the dirty saucer across the slippery surface of the paper in whatever direction his elders thus indicated.",But one and all knew 'subconsciously' the exact situation of consonants and vowels--that _oui_ lay in the right-hand corner and _non_ in the left.,"And neither Zizi nor his mother dared hint to their leader not to push, because she herself monopolised that phrase, saying repeatedly to them both, 'mais il ne faut _pas_ pousser!","Legerement avec les doigts, toujours tres legerement!","Sans ca il n'y a pas de valeur, tu comprends!'",Zizi inserted an occasional electrical question.,It was discreetly ignored always.,"They asked about the Bank payments, the mortgages, the future of their much-loved old house, and of themselves; and the answers, so vague concerning any detailed things to come, were very positive indeed about the Bank.",They were to go and interview the Manager three days from now.,"They had already meant to go, only the date was undecided; the corroboration of the spirits was required to confirm it.",This settled it.,Three days from to-night!,'Tu vois!',"whispered Tante Jeanne, glancing mysteriously across the table at her sister.",'Three days from now!,That explains your dream about the three birds.,"Aha, tu vois!'","She leaned back, supremely satisfied.","And the sister gravely bowed her head, while Zizi looked up and listened intently, without comprehension.","He felt a little alarm, perhaps, to-night.",For this night there _was_ indeed something new in the worn old ritual.,"There was a strange, uncalculated element in it all, unexpected, and fearfully thrilling to all three.",Zizi for the first time had his doubts about its being merely electricity.,"'C'est d'une puissance extraordinaire,' was the widow's whispered, eager verdict.","'C'est que j'ai enormement de fluide ce soir,' declared Zizi, with pride and confidence, yet mystified.","The other two exchanged frequent glances of surprise, of wonder, of keen expectancy and anticipation.",There was certainly a new 'influence' at work to-night.,They even felt a touch of faint dread.,"The widow, her ruling passion strong even before the altar, looked down anxiously once or twice at her disreputable attire.","It was vivid as that--this acute sense of another presence that pervaded the room, not merely hung about the little table.","She could be 'invisible' to the Pension by the magic of old- established habit, but she could not be so to the true Invisibles.",And they saw her in this unbecoming costume.,"She forgot, too, the need of keeping Zizi in the dark.",He must know some day.,What did it matter when?,"She tidied back her wandering hair with her free hand, and drew the faded garment more closely round her neck.",'Are you cold?',asked her sister with a hush in her voice; 'you feel the cold air--all of a sudden?',"'I do, _maman_,' Zizi answered.",'It's blowing like a wind across my hand.,What is it?',He was shivering.,He looked over his shoulder nervously.,"There was a heavy step in the hall, and a figure darkened the doorway.",All three gave a start.,"'J'ai sommeil,' announced the deep voice of the Postmaster.",This meant that the boy must come to bed.,It was the sepulchral tone that made them jump perhaps.,"Zizi got up without a murmur; he was glad to go, really.",He slept in the room with his parents.,"His father, an overcoat thrown over his night things, led him away without another word.",And the two women resumed their seance.,The saucer moved more easily and swiftly now that Zizi had gone.,"'C'est done _toi_ qui as le fluide,' each said to the other.","But in the excitement caused by this queer, new element in the proceedings, the familiar old routine was forgotten.",Napoleon and Marie Antoinette were brushed aside to make room for this important personage who suddenly descended upon the saucer from an unknown star with the statement--it took half an hour to spell--'Je viens d'une etoile tres eloignee qui n'a pas encore de nom.','There _is_ a starry light in the room.,"It was above your head just now,' whispered the widow, enormously excited.",'I saw it plainly.',She was trembling.,"'That explains the clouds in my dream,' was the tense reply, as they both peered round them into the shadows with a touch of awe.","'Now, give all your attention.","This has an importance, but, you know, an importance--' She could not get the degree of importance into any words.","She looked it instead, leaving the sentence eloquently incomplete.","For, certainly, into the quaint ritual of these two honest, troubled old women there crept then a hint of something that was uncommon and uplifting.",That it came through themselves is as sure as that it spelt out detailed phrases of encouragement and guidance with regard to their coming visit to the Bank.,That they both were carried away by it into joy and the happiness of sincere relief of mind is equally a fact.,That their receptive mood attuned them to overhear subconsciously messages of thought that flashed across the night from another mind in sympathy with their troubles--a mind hard at work that very moment in the carpenter's house--was not known to them; nor would it have brought the least explanatory comfort even if they had been told of it.,They picked up these starry telegrams of unselfish thinking that flamed towards them through the midnight sky from an eager mind elsewhere busily making plans for their benefit.,"And, reaching them subconsciously, their deep subconsciousness urged the dirty saucer to the spelling of them, word by word and letter by letter.","The flavour of their own interpretation, of course, crept in to mar, and sometimes to obliterate.",The instruments were gravely imperfect.,But the messages came through.,And with them came the great feeling that the Christian calls answered prayer.,They had such absolute faith.,They had belief.,'Go to the Bank.,Help awaits you there.,And I shall go with you to direct and guide.',This was the gist of that message from 'une etoile tres eloignee.',They copied it out in violet ink with a pen that scratched like the point of a pin.,"And when they stole upstairs to bed, long after midnight, there was great joy and certainty in their fighting old hearts.","There was a perfume of flowers, of lilacs and wistaria in the air, as if the whole garden had slipped in by the back door and was unable to find its way out again.",They dreamed of stars and starlight.,CHAPTER XXI     La vie est un combat qu'ils ont change en fete.,"_Lei Elus_, E. VERHAIREN.",The excitement a few days later spread through the village like a flame.,"People came out of their way to steal a glance at the Pension that now, for the first time in their--memory, was free of debt.","Gygi, tolling the bell at _midi_, forgot to stop, as he peered through the narrow window in the church tower and watched the Widow Jequier planting and digging recklessly in her garden.","Several came running down the street, thinking it was a warning of fire.",But the secret was well kept; no one discovered who had worked the miracle.,"Pride sealed the lips of the beneficiaries themselves, while the inhabitants of the Citadelle, who alone shared the knowledge, kept the facts secret, as in honour bound.","Every one wondered, however, for every one knew the sum ran into several thousand francs; and a thousand francs was a fortune; the rich man in the corner house, who owned so many vineyards, and was reputed to enjoy an income of ten thousand francs a year, was always referred to as 'le million naire.'","And so the story spread that Madame Jequier had inherited a fortune, none knew whence.",The tradespeople treated her thereafter with a degree of respect that sweetened her days till the end of life.,"She had come back from the Bank in a fainting condition, the sudden joy too much for her altogether.","A remote and inaccessible air pervaded her, for all the red of her inflamed eyes and tears.","She was aloof from the world, freed at last from the ceaseless, gnawing anxiety that for years had eaten her life out.","The spirits had justified themselves, and faith and worship had their just reward.","But this was only the first, immediate effect: it left her greater than it found her, this unexpected, huge relief--brimming with new sympathy for others.",She doubled her gifts.,She planned a wonderful new garden.,That very night she ordered such a quantity of bulbs and seedlings that to this day they never have been planted.,"Her interview with Henry Rogers, when she called at the carpenter's house in all her finery, cannot properly be told, for it lay beyond his powers of description.","Her sister accompanied her; the Postmaster, too, snatched fifteen minutes from his duties to attend.","The ancient tall hat, worn only at funerals as a rule, was replaced by the black Trilby that had been his portion from the Magic Box, as he followed the excited ladies at a reasonable distance.","'You had better show yourself,' his wife suggested; 'Monsieur Rogairs would like to see you with us--to know that you are there.'","Which meant that he was not to interfere with the actual thanksgiving, but to countenance the occasion with his solemn presence.","And, indeed, he did not go upstairs.","He paced the road beneath the windows during the interview, looking exactly like a professional mourner waiting for the arrival of the hearse.","'My dear old friend--friends, I mean,' said Rogers in his fluent and very dreadful French, 'if you only knew what a pleasure it is to _me_--It is _I_ who should thank you for giving me the opportunity, not you who should thank me.'","The sentence broke loose utterly, wandering among intricacies of grammar and subjunctive moods that took his breath away as he poured it out.",'I was only afraid you would think it unwarrantable interference.,I am delighted that you let me do it.,It's such a little thing to do.',Both ladies instantly wept.,The Widow came closer with a little rush.,"Whether Rogers was actually embraced, or no, it is not stated officially.","'It is a loan, of course, it is a loan,' cried the Widow.","'It is a present,' he said firmly, loathing the scene.",'It's a part repayment for all the kindness you showed me here as a boy years and years ago.',"Then, remembering that the sister was not known to him in those far-away days, he added clumsily, 'and since--I came back.... And now let's say no more, but just keep the little secret to ourselves.",It is nobody's business but our own.','A present!',"gasped both ladies to one another, utterly overcome; and finding nothing else to embrace, they flung their arms about each other's necks and praised the Lord and wept more copiously than ever.... 'Grand ciel' was heard so frequently, and so loudly, that Madame Michaud, the carpenter's wife, listening on the stairs, made up her mind it was a quarrel, and wondered if she ought to knock at the door and interfere.","'I see your husband in the road,' said Rogers, tapping at the window.",'I think he seems waiting for you.,"Or perhaps he has a telegram for me, do you think?'","He bowed and waved his hand, smiling as the Postmaster looked up in answer to the tapping and gravely raised his Trilby hat.","'There now, he's calling for you.",Do not keep him waiting--I'm sure--' he didn't know what to say or how else to get them out.,He opened the door.,"The farewells took some time, though they would meet an hour later at _dejeuner_ as usual.","'At least you shall pay us no more _pension_,' was the final sentence as they flounced downstairs, so happy and excited that they nearly tumbled over each other, and sharing one handkerchief to dry their tears.","'Then I shall buy my own food and cook it here,' he laughed, and somehow managed to close his door upon the retreating storm.","Out of the window he saw the procession go back, the sombre figure of the Postmaster twenty yards behind the other two.","And then, with joy in his heart, though a sigh of relief upon his lips--there may have been traces of a lump somewhere in his throat as well, but if so, he did not acknowledge it--he turned to his letters, and found among them a communication from Herbert Montmorency Minks, announcing that he had found an ideal site, and that it cost so and so much per acre--also that the County Council had made no difficulties.","There was a hint, moreover--a general flavour of resentment and neglect at his master's prolonged absence--that it would not be a bad thing for the great Scheme if Mr. Rogers could see his way to return to London 'before very long.'",'Bother the fellow!',"thought he; 'what a nuisance he is, to be sure!'",And he answered him at once.,"'Do not trouble  about a site just yet,' he wrote; 'there is no hurry for the moment.'",He made a rapid calculation in his head.,"He had paid those mortgages out of capital, and the sum represented just about the cost of the site Minks mentioned.",But results were immediate.,"There was no loss, no waste in fees and permits and taxes.",Each penny did its work.,"'There's the site gone, anyhow,' he laughed to himself.","'The foundation will go next, then the walls.","But, at any rate, they needed it.",The Commune Charity would have had 'em at the end of the month.,They're my neighbours after all.,And I must find out from them who else in the village needs a leg up.,"For these people are worth helping, and I can see exactly where every penny goes.'","Bit by bit, as it would seem, the great Scheme for Disabled Thingumagigs was being undermined.",CHAPTER XXII     And those who were good shall be happy.,They shall sit in a golden chair;     They shall splash at a ten-league canvas       With brushes of comets' hair.,"They shall have real saints to paint from--       Magdalene, Peter, and Paul;     They shall work for an age at a sitting       And never get tired at all.","And only the Master shall praise them,       And only the Master shall blame;     And no one shall work for money,       And no one shall work for fame;     But each for the joy of the working,       And each in his separate star,     Shall draw the thing as he sees it       For the God of things as they are,                              R.

for disorder involves surprise.",Any moment out might pop the unexpected--event or person.,Cousin Henry was easily leader now.,"While Daddy remained absorbed with his marvellous new story, enthusiastic and invisible, they ran about the world at the heels of this 'busy engineer,' as Jane Ann entitled him.","He had long ago told them, with infinite and exaccurate detail, of his journey to the garden and his rediscovery of the sprites, forgotten during his twenty years of business life.",And these sprites were as familiar to them now as those of their own childhood.,They little knew that at night they met and talked with them.,"Daddy had put them all into the Wumble Book, achieving mediocre success with the rhymes, but amply atoning with the illustrations.","The Woman of the Haystack was evidently a monster pure and simple, till Jinny announced that she merely had 'elephantitis,' and thus explained her satisfactorily.","The Lamplighter, with shining feet, taking enormous strides from Neuchatel to a London slum, putting fire into eyes and hearts _en route_, thrilled them by his radiant speed and ubiquitous activity, while his doggerel left them coldly questioning.",For the rhymes did _not_ commend themselves to their sense of what was proper in the use of words.,"His natural history left them unconvinced, though the anatomy of the drawing fascinated them.","He walked upon his toes      As softly as a saying does,      For so the saying goes.","That he 'walked upon his toes' was all right, but that he 'walked softly as a saying' meant nothing, even when explained that 'thus the saying goes.'","'Poor old Daddy,' was Jinny's judgment;

the smell crept out like incense; the lines of smoke coiled upwards, and seemed to draw the tree-stems with them.","Indeed they formed a pattern together, big thick trunks marking the uprights at the corners, and wavy smoke lines weaving a delicate structure in between them.","It was a kind of growing, moving scaffolding.","Saying nothing, Cousin Henry pointed to it with his finger.",He traced its general pattern for them in the air.,"'That's the Scaffolding of the Night beginning,' he whispered presently, feeling adventure press upon him.","'Oh, I say,' said Jimbo, sitting up, and pretending as usual more comprehension than he actually possessed.","But his sister instantly asked, 'What is it--the Scaffolding of the Night?","A sort of cathedral, you mean?'","How she divined his thought, and snatched it from his mind always, this nimble-witted child!",His germ developed with a bound at once.,"'More a palace than a cathedral,' he whispered.","'Night is a palace, and has to be built afresh each time.","Twilight rears the scaffolding first, then hangs the Night upon it.","Otherwise the darkness would simply fall in lumps, and lie about in pools and blocks, unfinished--a ruin instead of a building.",Everything must have a scaffolding first.,"Look how beautifully it's coming now,' he added, pointing, 'each shadow in its place, and all the lines of grey and black fitting exaccurately together like a skeleton.",Have you never noticed it before?',"Jimbo, of course, _had_ noticed it, his manner gave them to understand, but had not thought it worth while mentioning until his leader drew attention to it.","'Just as trains must have rails to run on,' he explained across Cousinenry's intervening body to Monkey, 'or else there'd be accidents and things all the time.'","'And night would be a horrid darkness like a plague in Egypt,' she supposed, adroitly defending herself and helping her cousin at the same time.",'Wouldn't it?',"she added, as the shadows drew magically nearer from the forest and made the fire gradually grow brighter.","The children snuggled closer to their cousin's comforting bulk, shivering a little.",The woods went whispering together.,Night shook her velvet skirts out.,"'Yes, everything has its pattern,' he answered, 'from the skeleton of a child or a universe to the outline of a thought.","Even a dream must have its scaffolding,' he added, feeling their shudder and leading it towards fun and beauty.","'Insects, birds, and animals all make little scaffoldings with their wee emotions, especially kittens and butterflies.","Engine-drivers too,' for he felt Jimbo's hand steal into his own and go to sleep there, 'but particularly little beasties that live in holes under stones and in fields.","When a little mouse in wonder      Flicks its whiskers at the thunder, it makes a tiny scaffolding behind which it hides in safety, shuddering.",Same with Daddy's stories.,Thinking and feeling does the trick.,"Then imagination comes and builds it up solidly with bricks and wall-papers....'

it stood like an ebony statue in an atmosphere that was thick with gloom, turgid, sinister, and wholly rayless.",It was like a lantern in a London fog.,"A few dim lines of sombre grey issued heavily from it, but got no farther than its outer surface, then doubled back and plunged in again.",They coiled and twisted into ugly knots.,"Her mother's atmosphere was opaque, and as dismal as a November fog.","There was a speck of light in the room, however, and it came, the visitor then perceived, from a single candle that stood beside the bed.",The old lady had been reading; she rarely slept before two o'clock in the morning.,"And at first, so disheartening, so hopeless seemed the task, that Mother wavered in her mission; a choking, suffocating sensation blocked all her channels of delivery.","The very flowers on the window- sill, she noted, drooped in a languishing decline; they had a lifeless air as of flowers that struggle for existence in deep shadow and have never known the kiss of sunshine.","Through the inch of opened window stole a soft breath of the night air, but it turned black and sluggish the moment it came in.","And just then, as Mother hovered there in hesitating doubt, the figure turned and moved across to the bed, supporting herself with the ebony cane she always used.",Stiffly she sank upon her knees.,"The habit was as strong as putting her shoes outside the door at night to be cleaned,-those shoes that never knew the stain of roadway dust-and equally devoid of spiritual significance.","Yet, for a moment, as the embittered mind gabbled through the string of words that long habit had crystallised into an empty formula, Mother noticed that the lines of grey grew slightly clearer; the coil and tangle ceased; they even made an effort to emerge and leave the muddy cloud that obscured their knotted, intricate disorder.","The formula Mother recognised; it had hardly changed, indeed, since she herself had learned it at those very knees when days were brighter; it began with wholesale and audacious requests for self, then towards the end passed into vague generalities for the welfare of others.",And just here it was that the lines of grey turned brighter and tried to struggle out of the murky atmosphere.,"The sight was pathetic, yet deeply significant.",Mother understood its meaning.,There was hope.,Behind the prayer for others still shone at least an echo of past meaning.,"'I believe in you, old, broken, disappointed heart,' flashed through her own bright atmosphere, 'and, believing, I can help you!'","Her skill, however, was slight, owing to lack of practice and experience.","She moved over to the bed, trying first to force her own darting rays into the opaque, dull cloud surrounding the other; then seeking a better way-for this had no results---she slipped somehow inside the mist, getting behind it, down at the very source.","From here she forced her own light through, mixing her beams of coloured radiance with the thick grey lines themselves.","She tried to feel and think as her mother felt and thought, moving beside her mind's initial working, changing the gloom into something brighter as she moved along.","This was the proper way, she felt-to clean the source itself, rather than merely untie knots at the outer surface.","It was a stifling business, but she persisted.",Tiny channels cleared and opened.,A little light shone through.,"She felt-with her mother, instead of arguing, as it were...",The old lady presently blew the candle out and composed herself to sleep.,"Mother laboured on.... 'Oh dear,' she sighed, 'oh dear!'",as she emerged from the gloom a moment to survey her patient and note results.,"To her amazement she saw that there was a change indeed, though a very curious one.","The entire outer surface of the cloud seemed in commotion, with here and there a glimmering lustre as if a tiny lamp was at last alight within.",She felt herself swell with happiness.,"Instantly, then, the grey lines shot out, fastening with wee loops and curves among her own.",Some links evidently had been established.,She had imparted something.,'She's dreaming!,I do believe I've sown some dream of beauty in her!',she beamed to herself.,"Some golden, unaccustomed sleep had fallen over the old lady.","Stray shreds of darkness loosened from the general mass and floated off, yet did not melt entirely from sight.",She was shedding some of her evil thoughts.,'The Sweep!',"thought Mother, and turning, found him beside her in the room.","Her husband, to her astonishment, was also there.",'But I didn't think of _you_!',she exclaimed.,"'Not a definite thought,' he answered, 'but you needed me.",I felt it.,"We're so close together now that we're practically one, you see.'","He trailed his Pattern behind him, clothed now with all manner of rich new colouring, 'I've collected such heaps of new ideas,' he went on, 'and now I want her too.",She's in the Story.,I'll transfigure her as well.',"He was bright as paint, and happy as a sand-boy.","'Well done, old Mother,' he added, 'you've done a lot already.","See, she's dreaming small, soft, tender things of beauty that your efforts have let through.'","He glided across and poured from his own store of sympathy into that dry, atrophied soul upon the bed.","'It's a question how much she will be able to transmit, though,' he said doubtfully.",'The spiritual machinery is so stiff and out of gear from long disuse.,In Miss Waghorn's case it's only physical--I've just been there--but this is spiritual blackness.,We shall see to-morrow.,"Something will get through at any rate, and we must do this every night, you know.'",'Rather!',echoed Mother.,"'Her actual self, you see, has dwindled so that one can hardly find it.","It's smaller than a flea, and as hard and black.'",They smiled a little sadly.,"The Sweep, rushing out of the window with his heavy sack loaded to the brim, interrupted their low laughter.","He was no talker, but a man of action.","Busily all this time he had been gathering up the loose, stray fragments that floated off from the cloud, and stuffing them into the sack.","He now flew, singing, into the night, and they barely caught the last words of his eternal song:--      '... a tremendously busy Sweep,       Tossing the blacks in the Rubbish Heap       Over the edge of the world.'","'Come,' whispered Daddy.",'It's getting late.,"The interfering sun is on the way, and you've been hours here already.","All the trains are back, and every one is waiting for us.'",Yet it had seemed so short a time really.,"Wrapped together in the beauty of his Pattern, they left the old lady peacefully asleep, and sped across the roofs towards the forest.","But neither of them noticed, it seemed, the lovely little shining figure that hovered far in the air above and watched them go.","It followed them all the way, catching even at the skirts of the flying Pattern as they went.",Was it the Spirit of some unknown Star they had attracted from beyond the Milky Way?,"Or was it, perhaps, a Thought from some fair, exquisite heart that had been wakened by the rushing of the Expresses, and had flashed in to take a place in the wonderful story Daddy wove?","It had little twinkling feet, and its eyes were of brown flame and amber.","'No, they did not notice the starry, fluttering figure.","It overtook them none the less, and with a flying leap was into the Pattern of his story--in the very centre, too!--as quickly as lightning passes through the foliage of the tree it strikes.",Only the lightning stayed.,The figure remained caught.,"The entire Pattern shivered to its outer fringes, then began to glow and shine all over.","As the high harmonic crowns the end of a long cadenza on a violin, fulfilling bars of difficult effort, this point of exquisite beauty flashed life into the Pattern of the story, consummating the labour of construction with the true, inevitable climax.","There was something of fairy insolence, both cheeky and delicious, in the proprietary way it chose the principal place, yet the only place still unoccupied, and sang 'I'm here.",I've come!',"It calmly fashioned itself a nest, as it were, curled up and made itself at home.",It _was_ at home.,The audacity was justified.,The Pattern seemed at last complete.,Beauty and Truth shone at its centre.,"And the tiny voice continued singing, though no one seemed to know exactly whence the sound proceeded:---     'While the busy Pleiades,     Sisters to the Hyades,     Seven by seven,     Across the heaven,     Light desire     With their fire,     Flung from huge Orion's hand,     Sweetly linking     All our thinking     In the Net of Sympathy that brings back Fairyland!'",No--neither Mother nor Daddy were aware of what had happened thus in the twinkling of an eye.,"Certainly neither guessed that another heart, far distant as the crow flies, had felt the stream of his vital, creative thinking, and had thus delicately responded and sent out a sympathetic message of belief.","But neither did Adams and Leverrier, measuring the heavens, and calculating through years of labour the delicate interstellar forces, know that each had simultaneously caught Neptune in their net of stars--three thousand million miles away.","Had they been 'out,' these two big, patient astronomers, they might have realised that they really worked in concert every night.","But history does not relate that they slept well or ill; their biographies make no mention of what their 'Underneaths' were up to while their brains lay resting on the pillow; and private confession, if such exists, has never seen the light of print as yet.","In that region, however, where Thinking runs and plays, thought dancing hand in hand with thought that is akin to it, the fact must surely have been known and recognised.","They, too, travelled in the Starlight Express.",Mother and Daddy realised it just then as little as children are aware of the loving thoughts of the parent that hovers protectingly about them all day long.,"They merely acknowledged that a prodigious thrill of happiness pulsed through both of them at once, feeling proud as the group in the tree-tops praised their increased brightness and admired the marvellous shining of the completed Pattern they trailed above their heads.",But more than that they did not grasp.,Nor have they ever grasped it perhaps.,"That the result came through later is proved, however, by the published story, and by the strange, sweet beauty its readers felt all over the world.","But this belongs to the private working of inspiration which can never be explained, not even by the artist it has set on fire.","He, indeed, probably understands it least of all.","'Where are the trains, the Starlight Expresses?'",asked Mother.,'Gone!',answered Jimbo.,'Gone to Australia where they're wanted.,It's evening now down there.',"He pointed down, then up.",'Don't you see?,We must hurry.',She looked across the lake where the monstrous wall of Alps was dimly visible.,The sky was brightening behind them.,Long strata of thin cloud glimmered with faintest pink.,The stars were rapidly fading.,'What ages you've been!',he added.,'And where's Tante Anna?',"she inquired quickly, looking for her brilliant friend.","'She's come and gone a dozen times while you've been skylarking somewhere else,' explained Monkey with her usual exaggeration.",'She's gone for good now.,She sleeps so badly.,"She's always waking up, you know.'",Mother understood.,"Only too well she knew that her friend snatched sleep in briefest intervals, incessantly disturbed by racking pain.","A stream of light flashed past her, dashing like a meteor towards the village and disappearing before she could see the figure.","'There goes Jinny,' cried some one, 'always working to the very last.",The interfering sun'll catch her if she doesn't look out!',There was movement and hurry everywhere.,Already the world ran loose and soft in colour.,"Birds, just awake, were singing in the trees below.","Several passed swiftly overhead, raking the sky with a whirring rush of wings.","Everybody was asking questions, urging return, yet lingering as long as possible, each according to his courage.",To be caught 'out' by the sun meant waking with a sudden start that made getting out of bed very difficult and might even cause a headache.,"Rogers alone seemed unperturbed, unhurried, for he was absorbed in a discovery that made him tremble.","Noting the sudden perfection of his cousin's Pattern, he had gone closer to examine it, and had--seen the starry figure.",Instantly he forgot everything else in the world.,It seemed to him that he had suddenly found all he had ever sought.,He gazed into those gentle eyes of amber and felt that he gazed into the eyes of the Universe that had taken shape in front of him.,"Floating up as near as he could, he spoke-- 'Where do you come from--from what star?'",he asked softly in an ecstasy of wonder.,The tiny face looked straight at him and smiled.,"'From the Pleiades, of course,--that little group of star-babies as yet unborn.'","'I've been looking for you for ever,' he answered.","'You've found me,' sang the tiny voice.",'This is our introduction.,"Now, don't forget.","There was a lost Pleiad, you know.",Try to remember me when you wake.','Then why are you here?',He meant in the Pattern.,The star-face rippled with laughter.,'It's yours--your Scheme.,"He's given it perfect shape for you, that's all.",Don't you recognise it?,But it's my Story as well.,"...' A ray with crimson in it shot out just then across the shoulder of the Blumlisalp, and, falling full upon the tiny face, it faded out; the Pattern faded with it; Daddy vanished too.",On the little azure winds of dawn they flashed away.,"Jimbo, Monkey, and certain of the Sprites alone held on, but the tree-tops to which they clung were growing more and more slippery every minute.","Mother, loth to return, balanced bravely on the waving spires of a larch.","Her sleep that night had been so deep and splendid, she struggled to prolong it.",She hated waking up too early.,'The Morning Spiders!,Look out!',"cried a Sprite, as a tiny spider on its thread of gossamer floated by.",It was the Dustman's voice.,"Catching the Gypsy with one arm and the Tramp with the other, all three instantly disappeared.",'But where's my Haystack friend?',"called Mother faintly, almost losing her balance in the attempt to turn round quickly.","'Oh, she's all right,' the Head Gardener answered from a little distance where he was burning something.","'She just ""stays put"" and flirts with every wind that comes near her.",She loves the winds.,They know her little ways.',"He went on busily burning up dead leaves he had been collecting all night long--dead, useless thoughts he had found clogging a hundred hearts and stopping outlets.",'Look sharp!',cried a voice that fell from the sky above them.,"'Here come the Morning Spiders,      On their gossamer outriders!'",This time it was the Lamplighter flashing to and fro as he put the stars out one by one.,He was in a frantic hurry; he extinguished whole groups of them at once.,The Pleiades were the last to fade.,Rogers heard him and came back into himself.,For his ecstasy had carried him even beyond the region of the freest 'thinking.',He could give no account or explanation of it at all.,"Monkey, Jimbo, Mother, and he raced in a line together for home and safety.","Above the fields they met the spiders everywhere, the spiders that bring the dawn and ride off into the Star Cave on lost rays and stray thoughts that careless minds have left scattered about the world.","And the children, as they raced and told their mother to 'please move a little more easily and slipperily,' sang together in chorus:--     'We shall meet the Morning Spiders,      The fairy-cotton riders,      Each mounted on a star's rejected ray;      With their tiny nets of feather      They collect our thoughts together,      And on strips of windy weather      Bring the Day.","...' 'That's stolen from you or Daddy,' Mother began to say to Rogers--but was unable to complete the flash.",The thought lay loose behind her in the air.,A spider instantly mounted it and rode it off.,Something brushed her cheek.,"Riquette stood rover her, fingering her face with a soft extended paw.",'But it surely can't be time yet to get up!',she murmured.,"'I've only just fallen asleep, it seems.'","She glanced at her watch upon the chair beside the bed, saw that it was only four o'clock, and then turned over, making a space for the cat behind her shoulder.",A tremendous host of dreams caught at her sliding mind.,She tried to follow them.,They vanished.,'Oh dear!',"she sighed, and promptly fell asleep again.",But this time she slept lightly.,No more adventures came.,She did not dream.,"And later, when Riquette woke her a second time because it was half-past six, she remembered as little of having been 'out' as though such a thing had never taken place at all.",She lit the fire and put the porridge saucepan on the stove.,It was a glorious July morning.,"She felt glad to be alive, and full of happy, singing thoughts.",'I wish I could always sleep like that!',she said.,'But what a pity one has to wake up in the end!',"And then, as she turned her mind toward the coming duties of the day, another thought came to her.","It was a very ordinary, almost a daily thought, but there seemed more behind it than usual.","Her whole heart was in it this time-- 'As soon as the children are off to school I'll pop over to mother, and see if I can't cheer her up a bit and make her feel more happy.",Oh dear!',"she added, 'life is a bag of duties, whichever way one looks at it!'",But she felt a great power in her that she could face them easily and turn each one into joy.,"She could take life more bigly, carelessly, more as a whole somehow.",She was aware of some huge directing power in her 'underneath.',"Moreover, the 'underneath' of a woman like Mother was not a trifle that could be easily ignored.","That great Under Self, resting in the abysses of being, rose and led.","The pettier Upper Self withdrew ashamed, passing over the reins of conduct into those mighty, shadowy hands.","CHAPTER XXVI      Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades,        Or loose the bands of Orion?",_Book of Job_.,"The feeling that something was going to happen--that odd sense of anticipation--which all had experienced the evening before at tea-time had entirely vanished, of course, next morning.","It was a mood, and it had passed away.",Every one had slept it off.,They little realised how it had justified itself.,"Jane Anne, tidying the Den soon after seven o'clock, noticed the slip of paper above the mantelpiece, read it over--'The Starlight Express will start to-night.",Be reddy!',--and tore it down.,'How could that.,have amused us!',"she said aloud, as she tossed it into the waste-paper basket.","Yet, even while she did so, some stray sensation of delight clutched at her funny little heart, a touch of emotion she could not understand that was wild and very sweet.",She went singing about her work.,"She felt important and grown- up, extraordinarily light-hearted too.",The things she sang made up their own words--such odd snatches that came she knew not whence.,"An insect clung to her duster, and she shook it out of the window with the crumbs and bits of cotton gathered from the table-cloth.","'Get out, you Morning Spider,      You fairy-cotton rider!'","she sang, and at the same minute Mother opened the bedroom door and peeped in, astonished at the unaccustomed music.","In her voluminous dressing-gown, her hair caught untidily in a loose net, her face flushed from stooping over the porridge saucepan, she looked, thought Jinny, 'like a haystack somehow.'",Of course she did not say it.,"The draught, flapping at her ample skirts, added the idea of a covering tarpaulin to the child's mental picture.","She went on dusting with a half-offended air, as though Mother had no right to interrupt her with a superintending glance like this.","'You won't forget the sweeping too, Jinny?'","said Mother, retiring again majestically with that gliding motion her abundant proportions achieved so gracefully.","'Of course I won't, Mother,' and the instant the door was closed she fell into another snatch of song, the words of which flowed unconsciously into her mind, it seemed--     'For I'm a tremendously busy Sweep,      Dusting the room while you're all asleep,      And shoving you all in the rubbish heap,      Over the edge of the tiles' --a little wumbled, it is true, but its source unmistakable.","And all day long, with every one, it was similar, this curious intrusion of the night into the day, the sub-conscious into the conscious--a kind of subtle trespassing.","The flower of forgotten dreams rose so softly to the surface of consciousness that they had an air of sneaking in, anxious to be regarded as an integral part of normal waking life.","Like bubbles in water they rose, discharged their puff of fragrant air, and disappeared again.","Jane Anne, in particular, was simply radiant all day long, and more than usually clear-headed.","Once or twice she wumbled, but there was big sense in her even then.",It was only the expression that evaded her.,Her little brain was a poor transmitter somehow.,"'I feel all endowed to-day,' she informed Rogers, when he congratulated her later in the day on some cunning act of attention she bestowed upon him.","It was in the courtyard where they all sat sunning themselves after _dejeuner_, and before the younger children returned to afternoon school.","'I feel emaciated, you know,' she added, uncertain whether emancipated was the word she really sought.","'You'll be quite grown-up,' he told her, 'by the time I come back to little Bourcelles in the autumn.'",Little Bourcelles!,"It sounded, the caressing way he said it, as if it lay in the palm of his big brown hand.","'But you'll never come back, because you'll never go,' Monkey chimed in.","'My hair, remember---' '_My_ trains won't take you,' said Jimbo gravely.","'Oh, a train may _take_ you,' continued Monkey, 'but you can't leave.",Going away by train isn't leaving.',"'It's only like going to sleep,' explained her brother.",You'll come back every night in a Starlight Express---' 'Because a Starlight Express takes passengers--whether they like it or not.,"You take an ordinary train, but a starlight train takes you!'",added Monkey.,Mother heard the words and looked up sharply from her knitting.,"Something, it seemed, had caught her attention vividly, though until now her thoughts had been busy with practical things of quite another order.","She glanced keenly round at the faces, where all sat grouped upon the stone steps of La Citadelle.","Then she smiled curiously, half to herself.",What she said was clearly not what she had first meant to say.,"'Children, you're not sitting on the cold stone, are you?'","she inquired, but a little absent-mindedly.","'We're quite warm; we've got our thick under-neathies on,' was the reply.","They realised that only part of her mind was in the, question, and that any ordinary answer would satisfy her.","Mother resumed her knitting, apparently satisfied.","But Jinny, meanwhile, had been following her own train of thought, started by her cousin's description of her as 'grown-up.'",The picture grew big and gracious in her mind.,'I wonder what I shall do when my hair goes up?',"she observed, apparently _a propos de bottes_.","It was the day, of course, eagerly, almost feverishly, looked forward to.","'Hide your head in a bag probably,' laughed her sister.",Jinny flushed; her hair was not abundant.,Yet she seemed puzzled rather than offended.,"'Never mind,' Rogers soothed her.","'The day a girl puts up her hair, a thousand young men are aware of it,--and one among them trembles.'",The idea of romance seemed somehow in the air.,"'Oh, Cousinenry!'","She was delighted, comforted, impressed; but perplexity was uppermost.",Something in his tone of voice prevented impudent comment from the others.,"'And all the stars grow a little brighter,' he added.",'The entire universe is glad.','I shall be a regular company promoter!',"she exclaimed, nearer to wit than she knew, yet with only the vaguest inkling of what he really meant.","'And draw up a Memorandum of Agreement with the Milky Way,' he added, gravely smiling.","He had just been going to say 'with the Pleiades,' when something checked him.",A wave of strange emotion swept him.,"It rose from the depths within, then died away as mysteriously as it came.","Like exquisite music heard from very far away, it left its thrill of beauty and of wonder, then hid behind the breath of wind that brought it.","'The whole world, you see, will know,' he added under his breath to the delighted child.","He looked into her queer, flushed face.","The blue eyes for a moment had, he thought, an amber tinge.","It was a mere effect of light, of course; the sun had passed behind a cloud.","Something that he ought to have known, ought to have remembered, flashed mockingly before him and was gone.","'One among them trembles,' he repeated in his mind.",He himself was trembling.,"'The Morning Spiders,' said some one quietly and softly, 'are standing at their stable doors, making faces at the hidden sun.'","But he never knew who said it, or if it was not his own voice speaking below his breath.",He glanced at Jimbo.,"The small grave face wore an air of man-like preoccupation, as was always the case when he felt a little out of his depth in general conversation.",He assumed it in self-protection.,He never exposed himself by asking questions.,"The music of that under-voice ran on:--     'Sweet thoughts, like fine weather,      Bind closely together      God's stars with the heart of a boy.'","But he said it aloud apparently this time, for the others looked up with surprise.","Monkey inquired what in the world he was talking about, only, not quite knowing himself, he could not answer her.","Jimbo then, silent and preoccupied, found his thoughts still running on marriage.",The talk about his sister's hair going up no doubt had caused it.,"He remembered the young schoolmistress who had her meals at the Pension, and the Armenian student who had fallen in love with, and eventually married, her.",It was the only courtship he had ever witnessed.,Marriage and courtship seemed everywhere this morning.,'I saw it all with Mlle.,"Perette,' he informed the party.",'It began already by his pouring out water for her and passing the salt and things.,It _always_ begins like that.,He got shawls even when she was hot.',"He looked so wise and grave that nobody laughed, and his sisters even seemed impressed rather.",Jinny waited anxiously for more.,"If Mother did make an odd grimace, it was not noticed, and anyhow was cleverly converted into the swallowing of a yawn.",There was a moment's silence.,"Jimbo, proudly conscious that more was expected of him, provided it in his solemn little voice.","'But it must be horrid,' he announced, 'to be married--always sticked to the same woman, like that.'","No sentence was complete without the inevitable 'already' or 'like that,' translated from the language he was more at home in.",He thought in French.,"'I shall never marry myself (_me marier_) he decided, seeing his older sister's eyes upon him wonderingly.","Then, uncertain whether he had said an awfully wise or an awfully foolish thing, he added no more.","Anyhow, it was the way a man should talk--with decision.","'It's bad enough to be a wife,' put in Monkey, 'but it must be worse still to have one!'",But Jane Anne seemed shocked.,"A man, Jimbo reflected, can never be sure how his wisdom may affect the other sex; women are not meant to know everything.","She rose with dignity and went upstairs towards the door, and Monkey, rippling with laughter, smacked her as she went.",This only shocked her more.,"'That was a slight mistake behind,' she said reprovingly, looking back; 'you should have more reserve, I think,' then firmly shut the door.","All of which meant--so far as Jane Anne was concerned--that an important standard of conduct--grown-up, dignified, stately in a spiritual sense--was being transferred to her present behaviour, but transferred ineffectively.","Elsewhere Jane Anne lived it, _was_ it.","She knew it, but could not get at the part of her that knew it.",The transmitting machinery was imperfect.,Connecting links and switches were somehow missing.,"Yearning was strong in her, that yearning which is common to all the world, though so variously translated.","Once out of the others' sight, she made a curious face.","She went into her room between the kitchen and the Den, flung herself on the bed, and burst into tears.",And the fears brought relief.,They oiled the machinery perhaps.,"At any rate, she soon felt better.","'I felt so enormous and unsettled,' she informed Mother later, when the redness of her eyes was noticed and she received breathlessly a great comforting hug.",I never get anything right.',"'But you _are_ right, darling,' Mother soothed her, little guessing that she told the perfect truth.","'You are all right, only you don't know it.",Everybody's wumbled somewhere.',"And she advised her--ah, Mother was profoundly wise instinctively--not to think so much, but just go ahead as usual and do her work.","For Mother herself felt a little queer that day, as though something very big and splendid lay hiding just beyond her reach.","It surged up, vanished, then surged up again, and it came closest when she was not thinking of it.",The least effort of the mind to capture it merely plunged her into an empty gulf where she could not touch bottom.,The glorious thing ran instantly underground.,"She never ceased to be aware of it, but any attempt to focus resulted in confusion.","Analysis was beyond her powers, yet the matter was very simple really, for only when thought is blank, and when the mind has forgotten to think, can inspiration come through into the heart.","The intellect interprets afterwards, sets in order, regulates, examines the wonder and beauty the heart distils alchemically out of the eternal stream in which life everywhere dips its feet.","If Reason interferes too soon, or during transmission, it only muddles and destroys.","And Mother, hitherto, had always been so proud of being practical, prosaic, reasonable.",She had deliberately suppressed the other.,She could not change in a single day just because she had been 'out' and made discoveries last night.,"Oh, how simple it all was really, and yet how utterly most folk convert the wonder of it into wumbling!","Like Jane Anne, her miniature, she felt splendid all day long, but puzzled too.",It was almost like those religious attacks she had experienced in early youth.,She had no definite creed by which she could explain it.,"Though nominally Christian, like her husband, she could not ascribe her joy to a 'Holy Spirit,' or to a 'God' working in her.",But she was reminded of her early 'religious attacks' because she now experienced that large sensation of glorious peace and certainty which usually accompanies the phenomenon in the heart called 'conversion.',She saw life whole.,She rested upon some unfailing central Joy.,"Come what might, she felt secure and 'saved.'","Something everlasting lay within call, an ever-ready help in trouble; and all day she was vaguely conscious that her life lay hid with--with what?","She never found the word exactly, for 'Joy' was but one aspect of it.",She fell back upon the teachings of the big religions which are the police regulations of the world.,"Yet all creeds shared these, and her feeling was far deeper than mere moral teachings.",And then she gave up thinking about it.,"Besides, she had much knitting to do.","'It's come to stay anyhow; I feel in sympathy with everybody,' she said, and so dismissed vain introspection, keeping the simple happiness and peace.","That was her strength, as it was also Jinny's.",A re-formation had begun.,"Jimbo, too, felt something in his microcosmic way, only he said little and asked no single question.","It betrayed itself, however, to his Mother's widened vision.",He was all stirred up.,"He came back again from school at three o'clock--for it was Thursday and he did not take the singing lesson from three to four--put down his books with a very business-like air, forgot to kiss his Mother--and went out.","'Where are you off to, Jimbo?'",She scented mischief.,He was so _affaire_.,"He turned obediently at once, the face grave and puckered.","'Going over to the carpenter's house, Mummy.'","'What for, dear?",Why don't you stay and play here?',She had the feeling that her husband was absorbed in his work and would not like to be disturbed.,The boy's reply was evasive too.,"'I want to have a long discuss with Daddy,' he said.",'Can't you have your long discuss with me instead?',she asked.,He shook his head.,"'You see,' he answered solemnly, 'it's about things.'",'But Daddy's working just now; he'll be over to tea at four.,Can't it wait till then?',She understood too well to inquire what 'things' might be.,The boy wished to speak with one of his own sex--as one man to another man.,"'When a man's at work,' she added, 'he doesn't like to be disturbed.'","'All right,' was the reply.","'We can wait a little,' and he settled down to other things in a corner by himself.","His mind, clearly, was occupied with grave considerations he could not discuss with anybody, least of all with women and children.","But, of course, busy men must not be interrupted.","For a whole hour in his corner he made no sound, and hardly any movement.",But Daddy did not come at four o'clock.,He was evidently deep in work.,And Mother did not send for him.,"The carpenter's wife, she knew, would provide a cup of tea.","He came late to supper, too, at the Pension, nodded to Mother with an expression which plainly said, 'I've finished the story at last'; winked to his cousin, meaning, 'It came out all right, I'm satisfied,' and took his seat between Jinny and Mlle.","Vuillemot, the governess who had earned her meal by giving a music lesson that afternoon to a _pensionnaire_.","Jinny looked sideways at him in a spirit of examination, and picked the inevitable crumb deftly from his beard.",'Reminiscences!',she observed slyly.,"'You did have some tea, then.'","Her long word was well chosen for once; her mind unusually logical, too.","But Daddy made no reply; he went on eating whatever was set before him with an air of complete detachment; he devoured cold ham and salad automatically; and the children, accustomed to this absorption, ignored his presence.","He was still in the atmosphere of his work, abstracted, lost to the outer world.","They knew they would only, get wumbled answers to their questions and

chatter, but unable to enter it successfully at any point.","Mother, watching him, thought, 'He's sitting on air, he's wrapped in light, he's very happy'; and ate an enormous supper, as though an insatiable hunger was in her.","The governess, Mlle.","Vuillemot, who stood in awe of the 'author' in him, seized her opportunity.","She loved to exchange a _mot_ with a real writer, reading all kinds of unintended subtlety into his brief replies in dreadful French.","To-night she asked him the meaning of a word, title of a Tauchnitz novel she had been reading--Juggernaut; but, being on his deaf side, he caught 'Huguenot' instead, and gave her a laboured explanation, strangled by appalling grammar.",The historical allusions dazed her; the explanation ended on a date.,"She was sorry she had ventured, for it made her feel so ignorant.","'Shuggairnort,' she repeated bravely.",She had a vague idea he had not properly heard before.,"But this time he caught 'Argonaut,' and swamped her then with classical exposition, during which she never took her eyes off him, and decided that he was far more wonderful than she had ever dreamed.",He was; but not for the reasons she supposed.,"'Thank you,' she said with meek gratitude at the end, 'I thank you.'","'Il n'y a pas de quar,' replied Daddy, bowing; and the adventure came to an end.",The others luckily had not heard it in full swing;

and he no more laughed at her than he had laughed at Mother's 'nunculus.'","Even Jane Anne, he knew, would settle down comfortably before long into the great big pattern where a particular nook awaited--aye, needed--her bizarre, odd brilliance.","The most angular fragments would nest softly, neatly in.","A little filing, a little polishing, and all would fit together.",To force would only be to break.,Hurry was of the devil.,"And later, while Daddy played an ancient tune that was written originally as a mazurka yet did duty now for a two-step, he danced with Mother too, and the children paused to watch out of sheer admiration.","'Fancy, Mother dancing!'","they exclaimed with glee--except Jinny, who was just a little offended and went to stand by the piano till it was over.","For Mother danced as lightly as a child for all her pride of measurement, and no frigate ever skimmed the waves more gracefully than Mother glided over those uneven boards.","'The Wind and the Haystack' of course, was Monkey's description.","'You'll wind and haystack to bed now,' was the reply, as Mother sat and fanned herself in the corner.","The 'bed-sentence' as the children called it, was always formed in this way.","Whatever the child was saying when the moment came, Mother adopted as her verb.","'Shall I put some peat on, Mother?'",became 'Peat yourself off to bed-it's nine o'clock'--and the child was sorry it had spoken.,"Good-byes had really been said at intervals all day long, and so to- night were slight enough; the children, besides, were so 'excitey- tired,' as Monkey put it, that they possessed no more emotion of any kind.","There were various disagreeable things in the immediate future of To-morrow--getting up early, school, and so forth; and Cousin Henry's departure they lumped in generally with the mass, accepted but unrealised.","Jimbo could hardly keep his eyes alight, and Monkey's hair was like a baby haystack the wind had treated to an equinoctial storm.","Jinny, stiff, perplexed, and solemn with exhaustion, yet dared not betray it because she was older, in measurable distance of her hair going up.","'Why don't you play with the others, child?'","asked Mother, finding her upright on a sofa while the romp went on.","'Oh, to-night,' Jinny explained, 'I sit indifferent and look on.",I don't always feel like skedivvying about!',To skedivvy was to chivvy and skedaddle--its authority not difficult to guess.,"'Good-bye, Cousinenry,' each gasped, as his big arms went round them and squeezed out the exclamation.","'Oh, thank you most awfully,' came next, with another kiss, produced by his pressing something hard and round and yellow into each dirty little hand.","'It's only a bit of crystallised starlight,' he explained, 'that escaped long ago from the Cave.","And starlight, remember, shines for everybody as well as for yourselves.","You can buy a stamp with it occasionally, too,' he added, 'and write to me.'",'We will.,Of course!',Jimbo straightened up a moment before the final collapse of sleep.,"'Your train leaves at 6.23,' he said, with the authority of exclusive information.",'You must be at the station at six to get the _bagages enregistrees_.,"It's a slow train to Pontarlier, but you'll find a _wagon direct_ for Paris in front, next to the engine.",I shall be at the station to see you off.',"'_I_ shan't,' said Monkey.",Rogers realised with delight the true meaning of these brief and unemotional good-byes.,'They know I'm coming back; they feel that the important part of me is not going away at all.,My thinking stays here with them.',Jinny lingered another ten minutes for appearance's sake.,"It was long past her bed-time, too, but dignity forbade her retiring with the others.","Standing by the window she made conversation a moment, feeling it was the proper, grown-up thing to do.",It was even expected of her.,'Look!,"It's full moon,' she observed gravely, as though suggesting that she could, if she liked, go out and enjoy the air.",'Isn't it lovely?',"'No, yesterday was full moon,' Rogers corrected her, joining her and looking out.","'Two nights ago, to be exact, I think.'","'Oh,' she replied, as solemnly as though politics or finance were under discussion, 'then it's bigger than full moon now.","It goes on, does it, getting fuller and fuller, till--' 'Now, Jinny dear, it's very late, and you'd better full-moon off to bed,' Mother interrupted gently.","'Yes, Mother; I'm just saying good-night.'","She held her hand out, as though she was afraid he might kiss her, yet feared he would not.","'Good-bye, Mr. Cousin Henry, and I hope you'll have an exceedingly happy time in the train and soon come back and visit us again.'","'Thank you,' he said, 'I'm sure I shall.'","He gave her a bit of solid starlight as he said it, then suddenly leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek.","Making a violent movement like an experienced boxer who dodges an upper cut, Jinny turned and fled precipitately from the room, forgetting her parents altogether.","That kiss, she felt, consumed her childhood in a flash of fiery flame.","In bed she decided that she must lengthen her skirts the very next day, and put her hair up too.",She must do something that should give her protection and yet freedom.,For a long time she did not sleep.,She lay thinking it over.,"She felt supremely happy--wild, excited, naughty.","'A man has kissed me;

it was something that stirred and rose upon them from a far deeper strata of emotion than that caused by apparent separation.","For no pain lay in it, but a power much more difficult to express in the sounds and syllables of speech--Joy.","A great joy, creative and of big significance, had known accomplishment.","Each felt it, knew it, realised it.",The moonlit night was aware of it.,"The entire universe knew it, too.",The drama lay in that.,There had been creation--of more light....,The world was richer than it had been.,"Some one had caught Beauty in a net, and to catch Beauty is to transform and recreate all common things.",It is revelation.,"Through the mind of each of these three flowed the stream of casual thinking--images, reflections, and the shadowy scaffoldings of many new emotions--sweeping along between the banks of speech and silence.","And this stream, though in flood, did not overflow into words for a long time.","With eyes turned inwards, each watched the current pass.","Clear and deep, it quietly reflected--stars.","Each watched the same stream, the same calm depths, the same delicate reflections.","They were in harmony with themselves, and therefore with the universe....

'It's not my own idea,' he said; 'I'm convinced of that.","It's all flocked into me from some other mind that thought it long ago, but could not write it, perhaps.","No thought is lost, you see--never can be lost.","Like this, somehow, I feel it:--     Now sinks to sleep the clamour of the day,     And, million-footed, from the Milky Way,     Falls shyly on my heart the world's lost Thought--     Shower of primrose dust the stars have taught     To haunt each sleeping mind,     Till it may find     A garden in some eager, passionate brain     That, rich in loving-kindness as in pain,     Shall harvest it, then scatter forth again     It's garnered loveliness from heaven caught.","Oh, every yearning thought that holds a tear,     Yet finds no mission,     And lies untold,     Waits, guarded in that labyrinth of gold,--     To reappear     Upon some perfect night,     Deathless--not old--     But sweet with time and distance,     And clothed as in a vision     Of starry brilliance     For the world's delight.'","In the pauses, from time to time, they heard the distant thunder of the Areuse as it churned and tumbled over the Val de Travers boulders.","The Colombier bells, as the hours passed, strung the sentences together; moonlight wove in and out of every adventure as they listened; stars threaded little chapters each to each with their eternal golden fastenings.","The words seemed written down in dew, but the dew crystallised into fairy patterns that instantly flew about the world upon their mission of deliverance.","In this ancient Network of the Stars the universe lay fluttering; and they lay with it, all prisoners in Fairyland.","For the key of it all was sympathy, and the' delicate soul of it was tender human love.","Bourcelles, in this magic tale, was the starting- point whence the Starlight Expresses flashed into all the world, even unto unvisited, forgotten corners that had known no service hitherto.","It was so adaptable and searching, and knew such tiny, secret ways of entrance.","The thought was so penetrating, true, and simple.",Even old Mother Plume would wake to the recovery of some hitherto forgotten fragrance in her daily life... just as those Northern forests would wake to find new wild-flowers.,"For all fairytales issue first from the primeval forest, thence undergoing their protean transformation; and in similar fashion this story, so slight but so tremendous, issued from the forest of one man's underthinking--one deep, pure mind, wumbled badly as far as external things were concerned, yet realising that Bourcelles contained the Universe, and that he, in turn contained Bourcelles.","Another, it is true, had shown it to him, though all unwittingly, and had cleaned in his atmosphere the channels for the entrance of the glorious pattern.",But the result was the same.,"In his brain--perhaps by Chance, perhaps by God--lay the machinery which enabled him to give it out to others--the power and ability to transmit.","It was a fairy-tale of the world, only the world had forgotten it.",He brought back its fairyland again.,"And this fairyland, what and where was it?",And how could this tale of its recovery bring into his listeners' hearts such a sense of peace and joy that they felt suddenly secure in the world and safe mid all the confusion of their muddled lives?,"That there were tears in Mother's eyes seems beyond question, because the moonlight, reflected faintly from a wet cobble in the yard below, glistened like a tiny silver lantern there.",They betrayed the fact that something in her had melted and flowed free.,Yet there was no sadness in the fairy-tale to cause it; they were tears of joy.,"Surely it was that this tale of Starlight, Starlight Expresses and Star Caves, told as simply as running water, revealed the entire Universe--as One, and that in this mighty, splendid thing each of them nested safe and comfortable.","The world was really _thinking_, and all lay fluttering in the grand, magnificent old Net of Stars.","What people think, they are.",All can think Beauty.,"And sympathy--to feel with everything--was the clue; for sympathy is love, and to love a star was to love a neighbour.","To be without sympathy was to feel apart, and to think apart was to cut oneself off from life, from the Whole, from God and joy--it was Death.","To work at commonplace duties because they were duties to the Universe at large, this was the way to find courage, peace, and happiness, because this was genuine and successful work, no effort lost, and the most distant star aware of it.","Thinking was living, whether material results were visible or not; yearning was action, even though no accomplishment was apparent; thought and sympathy, though felt but for a passing moment, sweetened the Pleiades and flashed along the Milky Way, and so-called tangible results that could prove it to the senses provided no adequate test of accomplishment or success.","In the knowledge of belonging to this vast underlying unity was the liberation that brings courage, carelessness, and joy, and to admit failure in anything, by thinking it, was to weaken the entire structure which binds together the planets and the heart of a boy.","Thoughts were the fairies that the world believed in when it was younger, simpler, less involved in separation; and the golden Fairyland recovered in this story was the Fairyland of lovely thinking....","In this little lamp-lit room of the Citadelle, the two listeners were conscious of this giant, delicate network that captured every flying thought and carried it streaming through the world.","God became a simple thing: He fashioned Rogers's Scheme, even though it never materialised in bricks and mortar.","God was behind Mother, even when she knitted or lit the fire in the Den.","All were prisoners in His eternal Fairyland.... And the symbolism of the story, the so-called fantasy, they also easily understood, because they felt it true.",To be 'out' of the body was merely to think and feel away from self.,"As they listened they realised themselves in touch with every nation and with every time, with all possible beliefs and disbeliefs, with every conceivable kind of thinking, that is, which ever has existed or ever shall exist....",The heat and radiance given out by the clear delivery of this 'inspirational' fairy-tale must have been very strong; far-reaching it certainly was....,'Ah!',"sighed Rogers to himself, 'if only I could be like that!'",not realising that he was so.,'Oh dear!',"felt the Woman, 'that's what I've felt sometimes.",I only wish it were true of me!',"unaware that it could be, and even by the fact of her yearning, _was_ so.",'If only I could get up and help the world!',"passed like a flame across the heart of the sufferer who lay on her sleepless bed next door, listening to the sound of the droning voice that reached her through the wall, yet curiously ignorant that this very longing was already majestically effective in the world of definite action.","And even Mother Plume, pacing her airless room at the further end of the village and tapping her ebony stick upon the floor, turned suspiciously, as at a passing flash of light that warmed her for a sudden instant as it went.","'Perhaps, after all, they don't mean all these unkind things they do to me!'",she thought; 'I live so much alone.,Possibly I see things less clearly than I used to do!',"The spell was certainly very potent, though Daddy himself, reading out the little shining chapters, guessed as little as the rest of them how strong.","So small a part of what he meant to say, it seemed, had been transferred to the paper.","More than he realised, far, far more, lay between the lines, of course.","There was conviction in it, because there was vision and belief.",Not much was said when he put his roll of paper down and leaned back in his chair.,"Riquette opened her eyes and blinked narrowly, then closed them again and began to purr.",The ticking of the cuckoo clock seemed suddenly very loud and noticeable.,"'Thank you,' said Mother quietly in an uncertain kind of voice.",'The world seems very wonderful now--quite different.',She moved in her chair--the first movement she had made for over two hours.,"Daddy rubbed his eyes, stroked his beard, and lit a cigarette; it went out almost immediately, but he puffed on at it just the same, till his cousin struck a match and stood over him to see it properly alight.","'You have caught Beauty naked in your net of stars,' he murmured; 'but you have left her as you found her--shining, silvery, unclothed.","Others will see her, too.","You have taken us all back into Fairyland, and I, for one, shall never get out again.'","'Nor I,' breathed some one in the shadows by the window....",The clock struck two.,"'Odd,' said Mother, softly, 'but I never heard it strike once while you were reading!'","'We've all been out,' Rogers laughed significantly, 'just as you make them get out in the story'; and then, while Riquette yawned and turned a moment from the window-sill to say thank you for her long, warm sleep, Mother lit the spirit-lamp and brewed the cups of chocolate.","She tiptoed in next door, and as she entered the sick-room she saw through the steam rising from the cup she carried a curious thing--an impression of brilliance about the bed, as though shafts of light issued from it.",Rays pulsed and trembled in the air.,There was a perfume of flowers.,It seemed she stepped back into the atmosphere of the story for an instant.,"'Ah, you're not asleep,' she whispered.","'We've brewed some chocolate, and I thought you might like a cup.'","'No, I'm not asleep,' answered the other woman from the bed she never would leave until she was carried from it, 'but I have been dreaming.",It seemed the stars came down into my room and sang to me; this bed became a throne; and some power was in me by which I could send my thoughts out to help the world.,I sent them out as a king sends messengers--to people everywhere--even to people I've never heard of.,Isn't it wonderful?','You've had no pain?',For Mother knew that these sleepless hours at night brought usually intense suffering.,"She stared at her, noting how the eyes shone and glistened with unshed moisture.","'None,' was the answer, 'but only the greatest joy and peace I've ever known.'",The little glass of _calmant_ was untouched;

he came back to duty--duty in London--great, noisy, overwhelming London, with its disturbing bustle, its feverish activities, its complex, artificial, unsatisfying amusements, and its hosts of frantic people.","He grew older in a moment; he was forty again now; an instant ago, just on the further side of those blue woods, he had been fifteen.","Life shrank and dwindled in him to a little, ugly, unattractive thing.",He was returning to a flat in the dolorous edifice of civilisation.,"A great practical Scheme, rising in sombre bricks and mortar through a disfiguring fog, blocked all the avenues of the future.","The picture seemed sordid somewhere, the contrast was so striking.","In a great city was no softness; hard, sharp angles everywhere, or at best an artificial smoothness that veiled ugliness and squalor very thinly.","Human relationship worked like parts of a machine, cramped into definite orbits, each wheel, each pulley, the smallest deviation deemed erratic.","In Bourcelles, the mountain village, there was more latitude, room for expansion, space.",The heart leaped up spontaneously like a spring released.,"In the city this spring was held down rigidly in place, pressed under as by a weight; and the weight, surely, was that one for ever felt compelled to think of self--self in a rather petty, shameful way--personal safety.","In the streets, in the houses, in public buildings, shops, and railway stations, even where people met to eat and drink in order to keep alive, were Notice Boards of caution and warning against their fellow kind.","Instead of the kindly and unnecessary, even ridiculous little Gygi, there were big, grave policemen by the score, a whole army of them; and everywhere grinned the Notice Boards, like automatic, dummy policemen, mocking joy with their insulting warnings.","The heart was oppressed with this constant reminder that safety could only be secured by great care and trouble-- safety for the little personal self; protection from all kinds of robbery, depredation, and attack; beware of pickpockets, the proprietor is not responsible for overcoats and umbrellas even!",And burglar alarms and doors of steel and iron everywhere--an organised defence from morning till night--against one's own kind.,"He had lived among these terrible conditions all his life, proud of the personal security that civilisation provided, but he had never before viewed it from outside, as now he suddenly did.","A spiritual being, a man, lives in a city as in a state of siege among his own kind.","It was deplorable, it was incredible.","In little Bourcelles, a mountain village most would describe pityingly as half civilised and out of the world, there was safety and joy and freedom as of the universe.... His heart contracted as he thus abruptly realised the distressing contrast.","Although a city is a unit, all classes neatly linked together by laws and by-laws, by County Councils, Parliaments, and the like, the spirit of brotherhood was a mockery and a sham.","There is organised charity, but there is not--Charity.",In a London Square he could not ring the bell and ask for a glass of milk....,"In Bourcelles he would walk into any house, since there were no bells, and sit down to an entire meal!","He laughed as the absurd comparison darted across his mind, for he recognised the foolish exaggeration in it; but behind the laughter flamed the astonishing truth.","In Bourcelles, in a few weeks, he had found a bigger, richer life than all London had supplied to him in twenty years; he had found wings, inspiration, love, and happiness; he had found the universe.",The truth of his cousin's story blazed upon him like an inner sun.,In this new perspective he saw that it was a grander fairy-tale than he had guessed even when close to it.,"What was a Scheme for Disabled Thingumabobs compared to the endless, far- reaching schemes that life in Bourcelles suggested to him!",There was the true centre of life; cities were accretions of disease upon the surface merely!,He was leaving Fairyland behind him.,"In sudden moments like this, with their synthetic bird's-eye view, the mind sometimes sees more clearly than in hours of careful reflection and analysis.","And the first thing he saw now was Minks, his friendly, ridiculous little confidential secretary.","From all the crowds of men and women he knew, respected, and enjoyed in London, as from the vast deluge of human mediocrity which for him _was_ London, he picked out suddenly--little Minks--Herbert Montmorency Minks.","His mind, that is, darting forward in swift, comprehensive survey, and searching automatically for some means whereby it might continue the happiness and sweetness recently enjoyed, selected Minks.",Minks was a clue.,"Minks possessed--no matter how absurd the proportions of their mixing --three things just left behind: Vision, Belief, Simplicity, all products of a spiritual imagination.",And at first this was the single thought sent forward into the future.,"Rogers saw the fact, flash-like and true-then let it go, yielding to the greater pull that drew reflection back into the past.","And he found it rather dislocating, this abrupt stepping out of his delightful forest Fairyland.... Equilibrium was not recovered for a long time, as the train went thundering over the Jura Mountains into France, Only on the other side of Pontarlier, when the country grew unfamiliar and different, did harmony return.","Among the deep blue forests he was still in Fairyland, but at Mouchard the scenery was already changing, and by the time Dole was reached it had completely changed.",The train ran on among the plains and vineyards of the Burgundy country towards Laroche and Dijon.,"The abrupt alteration, however, was pain.",His thoughts streamed all backwards now to counteract it.,He roamed again among the star fields above the Bourcelles woods.,It was true--he had not really left Bourcelles.,"His body was bumping into Dijon, but the important part of him--thought, emotion, love--lingered with the children, hovered above the Citadelle, floated through the dusky, scented forests.",And the haunting picture was ever set in its framework of old burning stars.,He could not get the Pleiades in particular out of his mind.,"The pictures swarmed past him as upon a boy returning to school after the holidays, and each one had a background of sky with stars behind it; the faces that he knew so well had starry eyes; Jimbo flung handfuls of stars loose across the air, and Monkey caught them, fastening them like golden pins into her hair.","Glancing down, he saw a long brown hair upon his sleeve.",He picked it off and held his finger and thumb outside the window till the wind took it away.,"Some Morning Spider would ride it home--perhaps past his cousin's window while he copied out that wonderful, great tale.","But, instead--how in the world could it happen in clear daylight?--a little hand shot down from above and gathered it in towards the Pleiades.","The Pleiades--the Seven Sisters--that most exquisite cluster of the eastern sky, soft, tender, lovely, clinging close together always like a group of timid children, who hide a little dimly for fear of being surprised by bolder stars upon their enormous journey--they now shone down upon all he thought and remembered.",They seemed always above the horizon of his mind.,They never set.,"In them lay souls of unborn children, children waiting to be born.","He could not imagine why this particular constellation clung with such a haunting touch of beauty about his mind, or why some passion of  yearning unconfessed and throbbing hid behind the musical name.",Stars and unborn children had got strangely mixed!,He tried to recall the origin of the name--he had learned it once in the old Vicar's study.,"The Pleiades were attendants upon Artemis, the huntress moon, he recalled vaguely, and, being pursued by Orion, were set for safety among the stars.","He even remembered the names of some of them; there was Maia, Tagete, Alcyone, but the other four lay in his mental lumber room, whence they could not be evoked, although Merope, he felt sure, was one of them.","Of Maia, however, he felt positive.... How beautiful the names were!","Then, midway, in thinking about them, he found himself, as Monkey said, thinking of something else: of his weeks at Bourcelles again and what a long holiday it had been, and whether it was wasted time or well-used time-a kind of general stock-taking, as it were, but chiefly of how little he had accomplished after all, set down in black and white.","He had enjoyed himself and let himself go, rather foolishly perhaps, but how much after all had he actually accomplished?",He remembered pleasant conversations with Mother that possibly cheered and helped her--or possibly were forgotten as soon as ended.,He remembered his cousin's passing words of gratitude--that he had helped him somehow with his great new story: and he remembered--this least of all-that his money had done something to relieve a case or two of suffering.,And this was all!,The net result so insignificant!,"He felt dissatisfied, eager already to make new plans, something definite and thorough that should retrieve the wasted opportunities.","With a little thought and trouble, how easily he might have straightened out the tangle of his cousin's family, helped with the education of the growing children, set them all upon a more substantial footing generally.","It was possible still, of course, but such things are done best on the spot, the personal touch and presence of value; arranged by correspondence it becomes another thing at once and loses spontaneity.",The accent lies on the wrong details.,Sympathy is watered by the post....,Importance lodges in angles not intended for it.,"Master of his time, with certain means at his disposal, a modicum of ability as well, he was free to work hard on the side of the angels wherever opportunity might offer; yet he had wasted all these weeks upon an unnecessary holiday, frittering the time away in enjoyment with the children.",He felt ashamed and mortified as the meagre record stared him in the face.,"Yet, curiously enough, when Reason had set down the figures accurately, as he fancied, and totted up the trifling totals, there flitted before him something more that refused to be set down upon the paper.",The Ledger had no lines for it.,What was it?,"Why was it pleasant, even flattering?",Why did it mitigate his discontent and lessen the dissatisfied feeling?,"It passed hovering in and about his thoughts, though uncaught by actual words; and as his mind played with it, he felt more hopeful.","He searched in vain for a definition, but, though fruitless, the search brought comfort somehow.","Something _had_ been accomplished and it was due to himself, because without his presence it would never have been done.","This hint slipped into desire, yearning, hope--that, after all, a result _had_ perhaps been achieved, a result he himself was not properly aware of--a result of that incalculable spiritual kind that escapes the chains of definite description.","For he recalled--yet mortified a little the memory should flatter--that his cousin had netted Beauty in his story, and that Mother had spoken of living with greater carelessness and peace, and that each had thanked him as though he were the cause.","And these memories, half thought, half feeling, were comforting and delicious, so that he revelled in them lingeringly, and wished that they were really true.","For, if true, they were immensely significant.","Any one with a purse could build a hospital or pay an education fee, but to be helpful because of being oneself was a vast, incalculable power, something direct from God... and his thoughts, wandering on thus between fact and fantasy, led him back with a deep inexplicable thrill again to--the Pleiades, whose beauty, without their being aware of it, shines nightly for all who can accept it.","Here was the old, old truth once more-that the left hand must not know what the right is doing, and that to be is of greater importance than to do.","Here was Fairyland once more, the Fairyland he had just left.","To think beauty and love is to become them, to shed them forth without realising it.","A Fairy blesses because she is a Fairy, not because she turns a pumpkin into a coach and four....",The Pleiades do not realise how their loveliness may.... Rogers started.,"For the thought had borrowed a tune from the rhythm of the wheels and sleepers, and he had uttered the words aloud in his corner.",Luckily he had the carriage to himself.,He flushed.,Again a tender and very exquisite thing had touched him somewhere....,It was in that involuntary connection his dreaming had found between a Fairy and the Pleiades.,"Wings of gauzy gold shone fluttering a moment before his inner sight, then vanished.","He was aware of some one very dear and wild and tender, with amber eyes and little twinkling feet--some one whom the Great Tale brought almost within his reach....",He literally had seen stars for an instant--_a_ star!,Its beauty brimmed him up.,He laughed in his corner.,"This thing, whatever it was, had been coming nearer for some time.","These hints of sudden joy that breathe upon a sensitive nature, how mysterious, how wildly beautiful, how stimulating they are!","But whence, in the name of all the stars, do they come?","A great happiness passed flaming through his heart, an extraordinary sense of anticipation in it--as though he were going to meet some one who--who--well, what?--who was a necessity and a delight to him, the complement needed to make his life effective--some one he loved abundantly--who would love him abundantly in return.","He recalled those foolish lines he had written on sudden impulse once, then thrown away....",Thought fluttered and went out.,He could not seize the elusive cause of this delicious joy.,"It was connected with the Pleiades, but how, where, why?",Above the horizon of his life a new star was swimming into glory.,It was rising.,"The inexplicable emotion thrilled tumultuously, then dived back again whence it came...","It had to do with children and with a woman, it seemed, for the next thing he knew was that he was thinking of children, children of his own, and of the deep yearning Bourcelles had stirred again in him to find their Mother... and, next, of his cousin's story and that wonderful detail in it that the principal role was filled at last, the role in the great Children's Play he himself had felt was vacant.",It was to be filled by that childless Mother the writer's imagination had discovered or created.,And again the Pleiades lit up his inner world and beckoned to him with their little fingers of spun gold; their eyes of clouded amber smiled into his own.,It was most extraordinary and delightful.,"There was something--come much closer this time, almost within reach of discovery--something he ought to remember about them, something he had promised to remember, then stupidly forgotten.","The lost, hidden joy was a torture.","Yet, try as he would, no revelation came to clear the matter up.",Had he read it somewhere perhaps?,Or was it part of the Story his cousin had wumbled into his ear when he only partly listened?,"'I believe I dreamed it,' he smiled to himself at last in despair.",'I do believe it was a dream--a fragment of some jolly dream I had in my Fairyland of little Bourcelles!',"Children, stars, Fairyland, dreams--these brought it somehow.","His cousin's story also had to do with it, chiefly perhaps after all--this great story.","'I shall have to go back there to get hold of it completely,' he added with conviction.","He almost felt as if some one were thinking hard about him--one of the characters in the story, it seemed.","The mind of some one far away, as yet unknown, was searching for him in thought, sending forth strong definite yearnings which came to rest of their own accord in his own being, a garden naturally suited to their growth.","The creations of his boyhood's imagination had survived, the Sweep, the Dustman, and the Lamplighter, then why not the far more powerful creations in the story...?",Thought was never lost!,'But no man in his senses can believe such a thing!',"he exclaimed, as the train ran booming through the tunnel.","'That's the point,' whispered a voice beside him.",'You are _out_ of your senses.,Otherwise you could not feel it!',He turned sharply.,The carriage was empty; there was no one there.,"It was, of course, another part of himself that supplied the answer; yet it startled him.","The blurred reflection of the lamp, he noticed, cast a picture against the black tunnel wall that was like a constellation.",The Pleiades again!,It almost seemed as if the voice had issued from that false reflection in the shaking window-pane....,The train emerged from the tunnel.,He rushed out into the blaze of the Interfering Sun.,"The lovely cluster vanished like a dream, and with it the hint of explanation melted down in dew.",Fields sped past with a group of haystacks whose tarpaulin skirts spread and lifted in the gust of wind the train made.,"He thought abruptly of Mother.... Perhaps, after all, he had taught her something, shown her Existence as a big, streaming, endless thing in which months and years, possibly even life itself, were merely little sections, each unintelligible unless viewed as portions of the Whole, and not as separate, difficult, puzzling items set apart.","Possibly he had drawn her map to bigger scale, increased her faith, given her more sense of repose and peace, more courage therefore.","She thought formerly of a day, but not of its relation to all days before and behind.","She stuck her husband's 'reviews' in the big book, afflicted by the poor financial results they represented, but was unable to think of his work as a stage in a long series of development and progress, no effort lost, no single hope mislaid.",And that was something--_if_ he had accomplished it.,"Only, he feared he had not.",There was the trouble.,There lay the secret of a certain ineffectiveness in his character.,"For he did not realise that fear is simply suppressed desire, vivid signs of life, and that desire is the ultimate causative agent everywhere and always.","'Behind Will stands Desire,' and Desire is Action.","And if he _had_ accomplished this, how was it done?","Not by preaching, certainly.","Was it, then, simply by being, thinking, feeling it?","A glorious thought, if true!","For assuredly he had this faculty of seeing life whole, and even in boyhood he had looked ahead over its entire map.","He had, indeed, this way of relating all its people, and all its parts together, instead of seeing them separate, unintelligible because the context was left out.","He lived intensely in the present, yet looked backwards and forwards too at the same time.","This large sympathy, this big comforting vision was his gift.",Consequently he believed in Life.,"Had he also, then, the gift of making others feel and believe it too...?","There he was again, thinking in a circle, as Laroche flew past with its empty platforms, and warned him that Paris was getting close.","He bumped out of Fairyland, yet tumbled back once more for a final reverie before the long ugly arms of the city snatched him finally out.","'To see life whole,' he reflected, 'is to see it glorious.",To think one's self part of humanity at large is to bring the universe down into the heart.,"But to see life whole, a whole heart is necessary....","He's done it in that splendid story, and he bagged the raw idea somehow from me.",That's something at any rate.,...,So few think Beaaty....,But will others see it?,That's the point!',"'No, it isn't,' answered the voice beside him.","'The point is that he has thought it, and the universe is richer.","Even if others do not read or understand, what he has thought _is there now_, for ever and ever.'","'True,' he reflected, 'for that Beauty may float down and settle in other minds when they least are looking for it, and ignoring utterly whence comes the fairy touch.",Divine!,Delicious!,Heavenly!',"'The Beauty he has written came through you, yet was not yours,' the voice continued very faintly.",'A far more beautiful mind first projected it into that network which binds all minds together.,"'Twas thence you caught it flying, and, knowing not how to give it shape, transferred it to another--who could use it--for others....","Thought is Life, and Sympathy is living....' The voice died away; he could not hear the remainder clearly; the passing scenery caught his attention again; during his reverie it had been unnoticed utterly.","'Thought is Life, but Sympathy is living---' it rolled and poured through him as he repeated it.","Snatches of another sentence then came rising into him from an immense distance, falling upon him from immeasurable heights--barely audible:- '... from a mind that so loved the Pleiades she made their loveliness and joy her own... Alcyone, Merope, Maia...' It dipped away into silence like a flower closing for the night, and the train, he realised, was slackening speed as it drew into the hideous Gare de Lyon.","'I'll talk to Minks about it, perhaps,' he thought, as he stood telling the Customs official that he had no brandy, cigarettes, or lace.",'He knows about things like that.,"At any rate, he'll sympathise.'","He went across Paris to the Gare du Nord, and caught the afternoon boat train to London.","The sunshine glared up from the baking streets, but he never forgot that overhead, though invisible, the stars were shining all the time--Starlight, the most tender and least suspected light in all the world, shining bravely even when obscured by the Interfering Sun, and the Pleiades, softest, sweetest little group among them all.","And when at eleven o'clock he entered his St. James's flat, he took a store of it shining in his heart, and therefore in his eyes.","Only that was no difficult matter, for all the lamps far up the heights were lit and gleaming, and caught old mighty London in their gorgeous net.","CHAPTER XXIX      Think with passion      That shall fashion      Life's entire design, well planned.",_Woman of the Haystack_.,"'You are looking so wonderfully well, Mr. Rogers,' Minks observed at Charing Cross Station, 'the passage across the Channel, I trust, was calm.'",'And yourself and Mrs.,Minks?',"asked Rogers, looking into the equally sunburned face of his secretary, remembering suddenly that he had been to the sea with his family;

he smelt the woods and flowers; he heard the leaves rustle on the poplar's crest; and had merely to think of a certain room in the tumble-down old Citadelle for a wave of courage and high anticipation to sweep over him like a sea.,A new feeling of harmony was taking him in hand.,"It was very delightful; and though he felt explanation beyond his reach still, his talks with Minks provided peep-holes through which he peered at the enormous thing that brushed him day and night.",A great settling was taking place inside him.,Thoughts certainly began to settle.,"He realised, for one thing, that he had left the theatre where the marvellous Play had been enacted.","He stood outside now, able to review and form a judgment.",His mind loved order.,"Undue introspection he disliked, as a form of undesirable familiarity; a balanced man must not be too familiar with himself; it endangered self-respect.",He had been floundering rather.,After years of methodical labour the freedom of too long a holiday was disorganising.,He tried to steady himself.,"And the Plan of Life, answering to control, grew smaller instantly, reduced to proportions he could examine reasonably.",This was the beginning of success.,"The bewildering light of fairyland still glimmered, but no longer so diffused.",It focused into little definite kernels he could hold steady while he scrutinised them.,"And these kernels he examined carefully as might be: in the quiet, starry evenings usually, while walking alone in St. James's Park after his day of board meetings, practical work with Minks, and the like.","Gradually then, out of the close survey, emerged certain things that seemed linked together in an intelligible sequence of cause and effect.","There was still mystery, for subconscious investigation ever involves this background of shadow.",Question and Wonder watched him.,But the facts emerged.,He jotted them down on paper as best he could.,"The result looked like a Report drawn up by Minks, only less concise and--he was bound to admit it--less intelligible.","He smiled as he read them over.... 'My thoughts and longings, awakened that night in the little Crayfield garden,' he summed it up to himself, having read the Report so far, 'went forth upon their journey of realisation.",I projected them-- according to Minks--vividly enough for that!,I thought Beauty--and this glorious result materialised!,"More--my deepest, oldest craving of all has come to life again--the cry of loneliness that yearns to--that seeks--er---' At this point, however, his analysis grew wumbled; the transference of thought and emotion seemed comprehensible enough; though magical, it was not more so than wireless telegraphy, or that a jet of steam should drive an express for a hundred miles.",It was conceivable that Daddy had drawn thence the inspiration for his wonderful story.,"What baffled him was the curious feeling that another was mixed up in the whole, delightful business, and that neither he nor his cousin were the true sponsors of the fairy fabric.",He never forgot the description his cousin read aloud that night in the Den--how the Pattern of his Story reached its climax and completeness when a little starry figure with twinkling feet and amber eyes had leaped into the centre and made itself at home there.,From the Pleiades it came.,The lost Pleiad was found.,The network of thought and sympathy that contained the universe had trembled to its uttermost fastenings.,The principal role was filled at last.,It was here came in the perplexing thing that baffled him.,"His mind sat down and stared at an enormous, shadowy possibility that he was unable to grasp.","It brushed past him overhead, beneath, on all sides.","He peered up at it and marvelled, unconvinced, yet knowing himself a prisoner.","Something he could not understand was coming, was already close, was watching him, waiting the moment to pounce out, like an invisible cat upon a bewildered mouse.","The question he flung out brought no response, and he recalled with a smile the verse that described his absurd position:--      Like a mouse who, lost in wonder,      Flicks its whiskers at the thunder!","For, while sprites and yearning were decidedly his own, the interpretation of them, if not their actual origin, seemed another's.","This other, like some dear ideal on the way to realisation, had taken him prisoner.","The queer sense of anticipation Bourcelles had fostered was now actual expectation, as though some Morning Spider had borne his master-longing, exquisitely fashioned by the Story, across the Universe, and the summons had been answered-from the Pleiades.",The indestructible threads of thought and feeling tightened.,"The more he thought about his cousin's interpretation the more he found in it a loveliness and purity, a crystal spiritual quality, that he could credit neither to the author's mind nor to his own.",This soft and starry brilliance was another's.,"Up to a point the interpretation came through Daddy's brain, just as the raw material came through his own; but there-after this other had appropriated both, as their original creator and proprietor.","Some shining, delicate hand reached down from its starry home and gathered in this exquisite form built up from the medley of fairy thought and beauty that were first its own.",The owner of that little hand would presently appear to claim it.,"'We were but channels after all then--both of us,' was the idea that lay so insistently in him.",'The sea of thought sends waves in all directions.,They roll into different harbours.,"I caught the feeling, he supplied the form, but this other lit the original fire!'",And further than this wumbled conclusion he could not get.,He went about his daily work.,"however, with a secret happiness tugging at his mind all day, and a sense of expectant wonder glancing brightly over everything he thought or did.","He was a prisoner in fairyland, and what he called his outer and his inner world were, after all, but different ways of looking at one and the same thing.",Life everywhere was one.,"CHAPTER XXXI     Es stehen unbeweglich     Die Sterne in der Hoh'     Viel tausend Jahr', und schauen     Sich an mit Liebesweh.","Sie sprechen eine Sprache,     Die ist so reich, so schon;     Doch keiner der Philologen     Kann diese Sprache verstehen.","Ich aber hab' sie gelernet,     Und ich vergesse sie nicht;     Mir diente als Grammatik     Der Herzallerliebsten Gesicht.",HEINE.,One evening in particular the sense of expectation in him felt very close upon delivery.,"All day he had been aware of it, and a letter received that morning from his cousin seemed the cause.","The story, in its shorter version, had been accepted.","Its reality, therefore, had already spread; one other mind, at least, had judged it with understanding.","Two months from now, when it appeared in print, hundreds more would read it.",Its beauty would run loose in many hearts.,And Rogers went about his work that day as though the pleasure was his own.,The world felt very sweet.,He saw the good in every one with whom he came in contact.,And the inner excitement due to something going to happen was continuous and cumulative.,"Yet London just then--it was August--was dull and empty, dusty, and badly frayed at the edges.","It needed a great cleaning; he would have liked to pour sea water over all its streets and houses, bathed its panting parks in the crystal fountains of Bourcelles.","All day long his thoughts, indeed, left London for holidays in little Bourcelles.",He was profoundly conscious that the Anticipation he first recognised in that forest village was close upon accomplishment now.,On the journey back to England he recalled how urgent it had been.,"In London, ever since, it had never really left him.",But to-day it now suddenly became more than expectation--he felt it in him as a certainty that approached fulfilment.,"It was strange, it was bewildering; it seemed to him as though something from that under-self he could never properly reach within him, pushed upwards with a kind of aggressive violence towards the surface.",It was both sweet and vital.,Behind the 'something' was the 'some one' who led it into action.,"At half-past six he strolled down a deserted St. James's Street, passed the door of his club with no temptation to go in, and climbed the stairs slowly to his rooms.",His body was languid though his mind alert.,He sank into an arm-chair beside the open window.,"'I must _do_ something to-night,' he thought eagerly; 'mere reading at the club is out of the question.",I'll go to a theatre or--or--.',"He considered various alternatives, deciding finally upon Richmond Park.",He loved long walks at night when his mind was restless thus; the air in Richmond Park was peculiarly fresh and scented after dark.,He knew the little gate that was never closed.,"He would dine lightly, and go for a ten-mile stretch among the oaks, surprise the deer asleep, listen to the hum of distant London, and watch the fairy battle between the lurid reflection of its million lights and the little stars....",There were places in the bracken where....,The rumbling clatter of a railway van disturbed the picture.,His mind followed the noise instead.,Thought flashed along the street to a station.,He saw trains... 'Come at once!,You're wanted here--some one calls you!',sounded a breathless merry voice beside him.,'Come quickly; aussi schnell que moglich!',There was a great gulp of happiness in him; his spirit plunged in joy.,He turned and looked about him swiftly.,"That singing voice, with its impudent mingling of languages was unmistakable.",'From the Pleiades.,Look sharp!,"You've been further off than ever lately, and further is further than farther--much!","Over the forests and into the cave, that is the way we must all behave---!'",He opened an eye.,Between him and a great gold sunset ran the wind.,It was a slender violet wind.,"The sunset, however, was in the act of disappearing for the Scaffolding of Dusk was passing through the air--he saw the slung trellis-work about him, the tracery of a million lines, the guy-ropes, uprights, and the feathery threads of ebony that trailed the Night behind them like a mighty cloth.",There was a fluttering as of innumerable wings.,"'You needn't tug like that,' he gasped.",'I'm coming all right.,I'm out!',"'But you're so slow and sticky,' she insisted.",'You've been sticky like this for weeks now!',He saw the bright brown eyes and felt the hair all over his face like a bath of perfume.,They rushed together.,His heart beat faster.... 'Who wants me in such a hurry?',"he cried, the moment he was disentangled.",Laughter ran past him on every side from the world of trees.,'As if you didn't know!,What _is_ the good of pretending any longer!,"You're both together in the Network, and you know it just as well as she does!'",Pretending!,Just as well as _she_ does!,As though he had eyes all over his body he saw the Net of Stars above him.,"Below were forests, vineyards, meadows, and the tiny lights of houses.",In the distance shimmered the waters of a familiar lake.,Great purple mountains rolled against the sky line.,"But immediately over his head, close yet also distant, filling the entire heavens, there hung a glittering Pattern that he knew, grown now so vast that at first he scarcely recognised its dazzling loveliness.","From the painted western horizon it stretched to other fastenings that dipped below the world, where the East laid its gulfs of darkness to surprise the sun.","It swung proudly down, as though hung from the Pole Star towards the north, and while the Great Bear 'pointers' tossed its embroidery across Cassiopeia, the Pleiades, just rising, flung its further fringes down to Orion, waiting in wonder to receive them far below the horizon.","Old Sirius wore one breadth of it across his stupendous shoulder, and Aldebaran, with fingers of bronze and fire, drew it delicately as with golden leashes over the sleeping world.","When first he saw it, there was this gentle fluttering as of wings through all its intricate parts, but the same moment four shooting stars pierced its outlying edges with flying nails of gold.",It steadied and grew taut.,'There she is!',"cried Monkey, flashing away like a comet towards the Cave.",'You'll catch it now--and you deserve to!',She turned a brilliant somersault and vanished.,"Then, somehow, the vast Pattern settled into a smaller scale, so that he saw it closer, clearer, and without confusion.",Beauty and wonder focused for his sight.,The perfected design of Daddy's fairy story floated down into his heart without a hint of wumbling.,Never had he seen it so luminous and simple.,"For others, of course, meanwhile had known and understood it.",Others believed.,"Its reality was more intense, thus, than before.","He rose from the maze of tree-tops where he floated, and stretched his arms out, no fear or hesitation in him anywhere.","Perched in the very centre of the Pattern, seated like a new-born star upon its throne, he saw that tiny figure who had thrilled him months ago when he caught it in a passing instant, fluttering in the web of Daddy's story,--both its climax and its inspiration.",The twinkling feet were folded now.,He saw the soft little eyes that shone like starlight through clear amber.,"The hands, palms upwards, were stretched to meet his own.","'You, of course, must come up--to me,' he heard.","And climbing the lace-like tracery of the golden web, he knelt before her.","But, almost before both knees were bent, her hands had caught him--the touch ran like a sheath of fire through every nerve--and he was seated beside her in that shining centre.",'But why did it suddenly grow small?',he asked at once.,He felt absolutely at home.,"It was like speaking to a child who loved him utterly, and whom he, in his turn, knew intimately inside out.","'Because you suddenly understood,' was the silvery, tiny answer.","'When you understand, you bring everything into yourself, small as a toy.",It is size that bewilders.,Men make size.,"Fairy things, like stars and tenderness, are always small.'","'Of course,' he said; 'as if I didn't know it already!'","'Besides,' she laughed, half closing her brilliant eyes and peering at him mischievously, 'I like everything so tiny that you can find it inside a shell.",That makes it possible to do big things.','Am _I_ too big---?',"he exclaimed, aware of clumsiness before this exquisite daintiness.","'A little confused, that's all,' her laughter rippled.",'You want smoothing down.,I'll see to that.',"He had the feeling, as she said it, that his being included the entire Pattern, even to its most distant edges where it fastened on to the rim of the universe.","From this huge sensation, he came back swiftly to its tiny correspondence again.",His eyes turned to study her.,"But she seemed transparent somehow, so that he saw the sky behind her, and in it, strangely enough--just behind her face--the distant Pleiades, shining faintly with their tender lustre.","They reached down into her little being, it seemed, as though she emanated from them.",Big Aldebaran guided strongly from behind.,"For an instant he lost sight of the actual figure, seeing in its place a radiant efflorescence, purified as by some spiritual fire--the Spirit of a Star.","'I'm here, quite close beside you,' whispered the tiny voice.",'Don't let your sight get troublesome like your size.,"Inside-sight, remember, is the thing!'","He turned, or rather he focused sight again to find her.",He was startled a little.,For a moment it seemed like his own voice speaking deep down within himself.,"'Make yourself at home,' it continued, 'you belong here--almost as much as I do.'",And at the sound of her voice all the perplexities of his life lay down.,"It brushed him smooth, like a wind that sets rough feathers all one way, He remembered again where he was, and what was going on.","'I do,' he answered, happy as a boy.",'I am at home.,It is perfect.',"'Do you, indeed!",You speak as though this story were your own!',And her laugh was like the tinkle of hare-bells in the wind.,"'It is,' he said; 'at least I had--I _have_, rather, a considerable hand in the making of it.'","'Possibly,' she answered, 'but the story belongs to the person who first started it.",And that person is myself.,The story is mine really!','Yours!',he gasped.,'Because--I am the story!',He stared hard to find the face that said this thing.,"Thought stopped dead a moment, blocked by a marvel that was impossible, yet true.",'You mean---?',he stammered.,"'You heard perfectly what I said; you understood it, too.","There's no good pretending,' impatience as well as laughter in the little voice.","'I am the story,--the story that you love.'",A sudden joy burst over him in a flood.,Struggle and search folded their wings and slept.,An immense happiness wrapped him into the very woof of the pattern wherein they sat.,"A thousand loose and ineffective moods of his life found coherence, as a thousand rambling strands were gathered home and fastened into place.",And the Pattern quivered and grew brighter.,'I am the story because I thought of it first.,"You, as a version of its beauty--a channel for its delivery--belong utterly to me.",You can no more resist me than a puddle can resist the stars' reflection.,You increase me.,We increase each other.',"'You say you thought it first,' he cried, feeling the light he radiated flow in and mingle with her own.",'But who are you?,Where do you come from?',"'Over there somewhere, I think,' she laughed, while a ray like fire flashed out in the direction of the Pleiades that climbed the sky towards the East.",'You ought to know.,You've been hunting for me long enough!','But who _are_ you?',"he insisted again, 'for I feel it's you that have been looking for me--I've so often heard you calling!'",She laughed again till the whole web quivered.,Through her eyes the softness of all the seven Pleiades poured deliciously into him.,"'It's absurd that such a big thing as you could hide so easily,' she said.",'But you'll never hide again.,I've got you fast now.,And you've got me!,"It's like being reflected together in the same puddle, you see!'","The dazzling radiance passed as she said it into a clearer glow, and across the fire of it he caught her eyes steadily a moment, though he could not see the face complete.","Two brilliant points of amber shone up at him, as stars that peep from the mirror of a forest pool.","That mental daylight-searching seemed all explained, only he could not remember now that there was any such thing at all as either searching or daylight.","When 'out' like this, waking was the dream---the sunlight world forgotten.","'This Pattern has always been my own,' she continued with infinite softness, yet so clearly that his whole body seemed a single ear against her lips, 'for I've thought it ever since I can remember.",I've lived it.,"This Network of Stars I made ages ago in a garden among far bigger mountains than these hills, a garden I knew vividly, yet could not always find--almost as though I dreamed it.","The Net included the-- oh, included everything there is, and I fastened it to four big pines that grew on the further side of the torrent in that mountain garden of my dream--fastened it with nails of falling stars.",And I made the Pleiades its centre because I loved them best of all.,Oh!,"Orion, Orion, how big and comforting your arms are!",Please hold me tight for ever and ever!',"'But I know it, too, that lovely dream,' he cried.",'It all comes back to me.,"I, too, have dreamed it with you then somewhere--somewhere---!'",His voice choked.,"He had never known that life could hold such sweetness, wonder, joy.",The universe lay within his arms.,"'All the people I wanted to help I used to catch in my Net of Stars,' she went on.","'There was a train that brought them up to its edges, and once I got the passengers into the web, and hung them loose in it till they were soaked with starlight, I could send them back happier and braver than they came.","It's been my story ever since I can remember anything--my adventure, my dream, my life.","And when the great Net faded a little and wanted brightening, we knew an enormous cavern in the mountains where lost starlight collected, and we used to gather this in thousands of sacks, and wash and paint the entire web afresh.","That made it sticky, so that the passengers hung in it longer.",Don't you remember?,They came back with starlight in their hair and eyes and voices--and in their hearts.',"'And the way you--_we_ got them into the Net,' he interrupted excitedly, 'was by understanding them--by feeling with them---' 'Sympathy,' she laughed, 'of course!","Only there were so many I could not reach and could not understand, and so could never get in.",In particular there was some one who ought to have been there to help me.,If I could find that some one I could do twice as much.,I searched and searched.,"I hunted through every corner of the garden, through forest, cavern, sky, but never with success.",Orion never overtook me!,"My longing cried every where, but in vain.","Oh, Orion, my lost Orion, I have found you now at last!...","The Net flashed messages in all directions, but without response.","This some one who could make my work complete existed--that I _knew_--only he was hidden somewhere out of sight--concealed in some corner or other, veiled by a darkness that he wove about himself--as though by some funny kind of wrong thinking that obscured the light I searched for and made it too dim to reach me properly.","His life or mind--his thought and feeling, that is--were wumbled---' '_Wumbled!_' he cried, as the certainty burst upon him with the password.","He stood close to her, opening his arms.","Instantly she placed her golden palm upon his mouth, with fingers that were like soft star-rays.","Her words, as she continued, were sweeter than the footfalls of the Pleiades when they rise above the sea.","'Yet there were times when we were so close that we could feel each other, and each wondered why the other did not actually appear.","I have been trying,' she whispered, oh so dearly, 'to find you always.","And you knew it, too, for I've felt you searching too....' The outlying skirts of the Pattern closed in a little, till the edges gathered over them like a tent of stars.","Alone in the heart of the universe they told their secret very softly.... 'There are twin-stars, you know,' she whispered, when he released her, 'that circle so close about each other that they look like one.","I wonder, oh, I wonder, do they ever touch!'","'They are apart in order to see one another better,' he murmured.",'They watch one another more sweetly so.,They play at separation for the joy of coming together again.',And once more the golden Pattern hid them for a moment from the other stars....,The shafts of night-fire played round and above their secret tent in space....,"Most marvellously their beings found each other in the great whispering galleries of the world where Thought and Yearning know that first fulfilment which is the source of action later.... 'So, now that I have found you,' her voice presently  went on, 'our Network shall catch everybody everywhere.","For the Pattern of my story, woven so long ago, has passed through you as through a channel--to another who can give it forth.",It will spread across every sky.,"All, all will see it and climb up.'","'My scheme---' he cried, with eager delight, yet not quite certain what he meant, nor whence the phrase proceeded.","'Was my thought first,' she laughed, 'when you were a little boy and I was a little girl--somewhere in a garden very long ago.",A ray from its pattern touched you into beauty.,"Though I could do nothing with it myself, one little ray shot into the mirror of your mind and instantly increased itself.","But then, you hid yourself; the channel closed---' 'It never died, though,' he interrupted; 'the ray, I mean.'","'It waited,' she went on, 'until you found children somewhere, and the channel cleared instantly.","Through you, opened up and cleaned by them, my pattern rushed headlong into another who can use it.","It could never die, of course.",And the long repression--I never ceased to live it-- made its power irresistible.','Your story!',he cried.,'It _is_ indeed your story.',The eyes were so close against his own that he made a movement that was like diving into a deep and shining sea to reach them....,The Pleiades rushed instantly past his face.... Soft filaments of golden texture stroked his very cheeks.,That slender violet wind rose into his hair.,"He saw other larger winds behind it, deeply coloured.... Something made him tremble all over like a leaf in a storm.","He saw, then, the crest of the sentinel poplar tossing between him and the earth far, far below.","A mist of confusion caught him, so that he knew not where he was....",He made an effort to remember... a violent effort....,Some strange sense of heaviness oppressed him....,He was leaving her.,'Quick!',he tried to cry; 'be quick!,I am changing.,I am drowsy with your voice and beauty.,"Your eyes have touched me, and I am--falling asleep!'",His voice grew weaker as he said it.,"Her answer sounded faint, and far above him: 'Give me... your... hand.",Touch me.,Come away with me... to... my ... garden ... in the mountains.... We may wake together ... You are waking now...!',He made an effort to find her little palm.,But the wind swept coldly between his opened fingers.,'Waking!--what is it?',he cried thinly.,"He thought swiftly of something vague and muddy--something dull, disordered, incomplete.",Here it was all glass-clear.,'Where are you?,I can't find you.,I can't see!',"A dreadful, searching pain shot through him.","He was losing her, just when he had found her.","He struggled, clung, fought frantically to hold her."
