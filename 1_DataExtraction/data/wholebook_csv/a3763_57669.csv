No.,8 hat!,"What the----"" V. When the fifth day of The Thinking Machine's imprisonment rolled around the warden was wearing a hunted look.",He was anxious for the end of the thing.,He could not help but feel that his distinguished prisoner had been amusing himself.,"And if this were so, The Thinking Machine had lost none of his sense of humor.","For on this fifth day he flung down another linen note to the outside guard, bearing the words: ""Only two days more.""",Also he flung down half a dollar.,"Now the warden knew--he _knew_--that the man in Cell 13 didn't have any half dollars--he _couldn't_ have any half dollars, no more than he could have pen and ink and linen, and yet he did have them.","It was a condition, not a theory; that is one reason why the warden was wearing a hunted look.","That ghastly, uncanny thing, too, about ""Acid"" and ""No.","8 hat"" clung to him tenaciously.","They didn't mean anything, of course, merely the ravings of an insane murderer who had been driven by fear to confess his crime, still there were so many things that ""didn't mean anything"" happening in the prison now since The Thinking Machine was there.",On the sixth day the warden received a postal stating that Dr. Ransome and Mr.,"Fielding would be at Chisholm Prison on the following evening, Thursday, and in the event Professor Van Dusen had not yet escaped--and they presumed he had not because they had not heard from him--they would meet him there.","""In the event he had not yet escaped!""",The warden smiled grimly.,Escaped!,The Thinking Machine enlivened this day for the warden with three notes.,"They were on the usual linen and bore generally on the appointment at half-past eight o'clock Thursday night, which appointment the scientist had made at the time of his imprisonment.",On the afternoon of the seventh day the warden passed Cell 13 and glanced in.,"The Thinking Machine was lying on the iron bed, apparently sleeping lightly.",The cell appeared precisely as it always did from a casual glance.,The warden would swear that no man was going to leave it between that hour--it was then four o'clock--and half-past eight o'clock that evening.,"On his way back past the cell the warden heard the steady breathing again, and coming close to the door looked in.","He wouldn't have done so if The Thinking Machine had been looking, but now--well, it was different.",A ray of light came through the high window and fell on the face of the sleeping man.,It occurred to the warden for the first time that his prisoner appeared haggard and weary.,Just then The Thinking Machine stirred slightly and the warden hurried on up the corridor guiltily.,That evening after six o'clock he saw the jailer.,"""Everything all right in Cell 13?""",he asked.,"""Yes, sir,"" replied the jailer.","""He didn't eat much, though.""",It was with a feeling of having done his duty that the warden received Dr. Ransome and Mr.,Fielding shortly after seven o'clock.,"He intended to show them the linen notes and lay before them the full story of his woes, which was a long one.",But before this came to pass the guard from the river side of the prison yard entered the office.,"""The arc light in my side of the yard won't light,"" he informed the warden.","""Confound it, that man's a hoodoo,"" thundered the official.","""Everything has happened since he's been here.""","The guard went back to his post in the darkness, and the warden 'phoned to the electric light company.","""This is Chisholm Prison,"" he said through the 'phone.","""Send three or four men down here quick, to fix an arc light.""","The reply was evidently satisfactory, for the warden hung up the receiver and passed out into the yard.",While Dr. Ransome and Mr.,Fielding sat waiting the guard at the outer gate came in with a special delivery letter.,"Dr. Ransome happened to notice the address, and, when the guard went out, looked at the letter more closely.","""By George!""",he exclaimed.,"""What is it?""",asked Mr.,Fielding.,Silently the doctor offered the letter.,Mr.,Fielding examined it closely.,"""Coincidence,"" he said.","""It must be.""",It was nearly eight o'clock when the warden returned to his office.,"The electricians had arrived in a wagon, and were now at work.",The warden pressed the buzz-button communicating with the man at the outer gate in the wall.,"""How many electricians came in?""","he asked, over the short 'phone.","""Four?",Three workmen in jumpers and overalls and the manager?,Frock coat and silk hat?,All right.,Be certain that only four go out.,"That's all.""",He turned to Dr. Ransome and Mr.,Fielding.,"""We have to be careful here--particularly,"" and there was broad sarcasm in his tone, ""since we have scientists locked up.""","The warden picked up the special delivery letter carelessly, and then began to open it.","""When I read this I want to tell you gentlemen something about how---- Great CÃ¦sar!""","he ended, suddenly, as he glanced at the letter.","He sat with mouth open, motionless, from astonishment.","""What is it?""",asked Mr.,Fielding.,"""A special delivery letter from Cell 13,"" gasped the warden.","""An invitation to supper.""","""What?""","and the two others arose, unanimously.","The warden sat dazed, staring at the letter for a moment, then called sharply to a guard outside in the corridor.","""Run down to Cell 13 and see if that man's in there.""","The guard went as directed, while Dr. Ransome and Mr.",Fielding examined the letter.,"""It's Van Dusen's handwriting; there's no question of that,"" said Dr. Ransome.","""I've seen too much of it.""","Just then the buzz of the telephone from the outer gate sounded, and the warden, in a semi-trance, picked up the receiver.","""Hello!","Two reporters, eh?","Let 'em come in.""",He turned suddenly to the doctor and Mr.,Fielding.,"""Why, the man _can't_ be out.","He must be in his cell.""",Just at that moment the guard returned.,"""He's still in his cell, sir,"" he reported.","""I saw him.","He's lying down.""","""There, I told you so,"" said the warden, and he breathed freely again.","""But how did he mail that letter?""",There was a rap on the steel door which led from the jail yard into the warden's office.,"""It's the reporters,"" said the warden.","""Let them in,"" he instructed the guard; then to the two other gentlemen: ""Don't say anything about this before them, because I'd never hear the last of it.""","The door opened, and the two men from the front gate entered.","""Good-evening, gentlemen,"" said one.",That was Hutchinson Hatch; the warden knew him well.,"""Well?""","demanded the other, irritably.","""I'm here.""",That was The Thinking Machine.,"He squinted belligerently at the warden, who sat with mouth agape.",For the moment that official had nothing to say.,Dr. Ransome and Mr.,"Fielding were amazed, but they didn't know what the warden knew.",They were only amazed; he was paralyzed.,"Hutchinson Hatch, the reporter, took in the scene with greedy eyes.","""How--how--how did you do it?""","gasped the warden, finally.","""Come back to the cell,"" said The Thinking Machine, in the irritated voice which his scientific associates knew so well.","The warden, still in a condition bordering on trance, led the way.","""Flash your light in there,"" directed The Thinking Machine.",The warden did so.,"There was nothing unusual in the appearance of the cell, and there--there on the bed lay the figure of The Thinking Machine.",Certainly!,There was the yellow hair!,Again the warden looked at the man beside him and wondered at the strangeness of his own dreams.,With trembling hands he unlocked the cell door and The Thinking Machine passed inside.,"""See here,"" he said.",He kicked at the steel bars in the bottom of the cell door and three of them were pushed out of place.,A fourth broke off and rolled away in the corridor.,"""And here, too,"" directed the erstwhile prisoner as he stood on the bed to reach the small window.",He swept his hand across the opening and every bar came out.,"""What's this in the bed?""","demanded the warden, who was slowly recovering.","""A wig,"" was the reply.","""Turn down the cover.""",The warden did so.,"Beneath it lay a large coil of strong rope, thirty feet or more, a dagger, three files, ten feet of electric wire, a thin, powerful pair of steel pliers, a small tack hammer with its handle, and--and a Derringer pistol.","""How did you do it?""",demanded the warden.,"""You gentlemen have an engagement to supper with me at half-past nine o'clock,"" said The Thinking Machine.","""Come on, or we shall be late.""","""But how did you do it?""",insisted the warden.,"""Don't ever think you can hold any man who can use his brain,"" said The Thinking Machine.","""Come on; we shall be late.""",VI.,It was an impatient supper party in the rooms of Professor Van Dusen and a somewhat silent one.,"The guests were Dr. Ransome, Albert Fielding, the warden, and Hutchinson Hatch, reporter.","The meal was served to the minute, in accordance with Professor Van Dusen's instructions of one week before; Dr. Ransome found the artichokes delicious.",At last the supper was finished and The Thinking Machine turned full on Dr. Ransome and squinted at him fiercely.,"""Do you believe it now?""",he demanded.,"""I do,"" replied Dr. Ransome.","""Do you admit that it was a fair test?""","""I do.""","With the others, particularly the warden, he was waiting anxiously for the explanation.","""Suppose you tell us how----"" began Mr.",Fielding.,"""Yes, tell us how,"" said the warden.","The Thinking Machine readjusted his glasses, took a couple of preparatory squints at his audience, and began the story.",He told it from the beginning logically; and no man ever talked to more interested listeners.,"""My agreement was,"" he began, ""to go into a cell, carrying nothing except what was necessary to wear, and to leave that cell within a week.",I had never seen Chisholm Prison.,"When I went into the cell I asked for tooth powder, two ten and one five-dollar bills, and also to have my shoes blacked.",Even if these requests had been refused it would not have mattered seriously.,But you agreed to them.,"""I knew there would be nothing in the cell which you thought I might use to advantage.","So when the warden locked the door on me I was apparently helpless, unless I could turn three seemingly innocent things to use.","They were things which would have been permitted any prisoner under sentence of death, were they not, warden?""","""Tooth powder and polished shoes, yes, but not money,"" replied the warden.","""Anything is dangerous in the hands of a man who knows how to use it,"" went on The Thinking Machine.","""I did nothing that first night but sleep and chase rats.""",He glared at the warden.,"""When the matter was broached I knew I could do nothing that night, so suggested next day.","You gentlemen thought I wanted time to arrange an escape with outside assistance, but this was not true.","I knew I could communicate with whom I pleased, when I pleased.""","The warden stared at him a moment, then went on smoking solemnly.","""I was aroused next morning at six o'clock by the jailer with my breakfast,"" continued the scientist.","""He told me dinner was at twelve and supper at six.","Between these times, I gathered, I would be pretty much to myself.",So immediately after breakfast I examined my outside surroundings from my cell window.,"One look told me it would be useless to try to scale the wall, even should I decide to leave my cell by the window, for my purpose was to leave not only the cell, but the prison.","Of course, I could have gone over the wall, but it would have taken me longer to lay my plans that way.","Therefore, for the moment, I dismissed all idea of that.","""From this first observation I knew the river was on that side of the prison, and that there was also a playground there.",Subsequently these surmises were verified by a keeper.,I knew then one important thing--that anyone might approach the prison wall from that side if necessary without attracting any particular attention.,That was well to remember.,I remembered it.,"""But the outside thing which most attracted my attention was the feed wire to the arc light which ran within a few feet--probably three or four--of my cell window.","I knew that would be valuable in the event I found it necessary to cut off that arc light.""","""Oh, you shut it off to-night, then?""",asked the warden.,"""Having learned all I could from that window,"" resumed The Thinking Machine, without heeding the interruption, ""I considered the idea of escaping through the prison proper.","I recalled just how I had come into the cell, which I knew would be the only way.",Seven doors lay between me and the outside.,"So, also for the time being, I gave up the idea of escaping that way.","And I couldn't go through the solid granite walls of the cell.""",The Thinking Machine paused for a moment and Dr. Ransome lighted a new cigar.,"For several minutes there was silence, then the scientific jail-breaker went on: ""While I was thinking about these things a rat ran across my foot.","It suggested a new line, of thought.",There were at least half a dozen rats in the cell--I could see their beady eyes.,Yet I had noticed none come under the cell door.,I frightened them purposely and watched the cell door to see if they went out that way.,"They did not, but they were gone.",Obviously they went another way.,Another way meant another opening.,"""I searched for this opening and found it.","It was an old drain pipe, long unused and partly choked with dirt and dust.",But this was the way the rats had come.,They came from somewhere.,Where?,Drain pipes usually lead outside prison grounds.,"This one probably led to the river, or near it.",The rats must therefore come from that direction.,"If they came a part of the way, I reasoned that they came all the way, because it was extremely unlikely that a solid iron or lead pipe would have any hole in it except at the exit.","""When the jailer came with my luncheon he told me two important things, although he didn't know it.",One was that a new system of plumbing had been put in the prison seven years before; another that the river was only three hundred feet away.,"Then I knew positively that the pipe was a part of an old system; I knew, too, that it slanted generally toward the river.",But did the pipe end in the water or on land?,"""This was the next question to be decided.",I decided it by catching several of the rats in the cell.,My jailer was surprised to see me engaged in this work.,I examined at least a dozen of them.,"They were perfectly dry; they had come through the pipe, and, most important of all, they were _not house rats, but field rats_.","The other end of the pipe was on land, then, outside the prison walls.","So far, so good.","""Then, I knew that if I worked freely from this point I must attract the warden's attention in another direction.","You see, by telling the warden that I had come there to escape you made the test more severe, because I had to trick him by false scents.""",The warden looked up with a sad expression in his eyes.,"""The first thing was to make him think I was trying to communicate with you, Dr. Ransome.","So I wrote a note on a piece of linen I tore from my shirt, addressed it to Dr. Ransome, tied a five-dollar bill around it and threw it out the window.","I knew the guard would take it to the warden, but I rather hoped the warden would send it as addressed.","Have you that first linen note, warden?""",The warden produced the cipher.,"""What the deuce does it mean, anyhow?""",he asked.,"""Read it backward, beginning with the 'T' signature and disregard the division into words,"" instructed The Thinking Machine.",The warden did so.,"""T-h-i-s, this,"" he spelled, studied it a moment, then read it off, grinning: ""This is not the way I intend to escape.""","""Well, now what do you think o' that?""","he demanded, still grinning.","""I knew that would attract your attention, just as it did,"" said The Thinking Machine, ""and if you really found out what it was it would be a sort of gentle rebuke.""","""What did you write it with?""","asked Dr. Ransome, after he had examined the linen and passed it to Mr.",Fielding.,"""This,"" said the erstwhile prisoner, and he extended his foot.","On it was the shoe he had worn in prison, though the polish was gone--scraped off clean.","""The shoe blacking, moistened with water, was my ink; the metal tip of the shoe lace made a fairly good pen.""","The warden looked up and suddenly burst into a laugh, half of relief, half of amusement.","""You're a wonder,"" he said, admiringly.","""Go on.""","""That precipitated a search of my cell by the warden, as I had intended,"" continued The Thinking Machine.","""I was anxious to get the warden into the habit of searching my cell, so that finally, constantly finding nothing, he would get disgusted and quit.","This at last happened, practically.""",The warden blushed.,"""He then took my white shirt away and gave me a prison shirt.",He was satisfied that those two pieces of the shirt were all that was missing.,"But while he was searching my cell I had another piece of that same shirt, about nine inches square, rolled into a small ball in my mouth.""","""Nine inches of that shirt?""",demanded the warden.,"""Where did it come from?""","""The bosoms of all stiff white shirts are of triple thickness,"" was the explanation.","""I tore out the inside thickness, leaving the bosom only two thicknesses.",I knew you wouldn't see it.,"So much for that.""","There was a little pause, and the warden looked from one to another of the men with a sheepish grin.","""Having disposed of the warden for the time being by giving him something else to think about, I took my first serious step toward freedom,"" said Professor Van Dusen.","""I knew, within reason, that the pipe led somewhere to the playground outside; I knew a great many boys played there; I knew that rats came into my cell from out there.",Could I communicate with some one outside with these things at hand?,"""First was necessary, I saw, a long and fairly reliable thread, so--but here,"" he pulled up his trousers legs and showed that the tops of both stockings, of fine, strong lisle, were gone.","""I unraveled those--after I got them started it wasn't difficult--and I had easily a quarter of a mile of thread that I could depend on.","""Then on half of my remaining linen I wrote, laboriously enough I assure you, a letter explaining my situation to this gentleman here,"" and he indicated Hutchinson Hatch.","""I knew he would assist me--for the value of the newspaper story.","I tied firmly to this linen letter a ten-dollar bill--there is no surer way of attracting the eye of anyone--and wrote on the linen: 'Finder of this deliver to Hutchinson Hatch, _Daily American_, who will give another ten dollars for the information.'","""The next thing was to get this note outside on that playground where a boy might find it.","There were two ways, but I chose the best.","I took one of the rats--I became adept in catching them--tied the linen and money firmly to one leg, fastened my lisle thread to another, and turned him loose in the drain pipe.",I reasoned that the natural fright of the rodent would make him run until he was outside the pipe and then out on earth he would probably stop to gnaw off the linen and money.,"""From the moment the rat disappeared into that dusty pipe I became anxious.",I was taking so many chances.,"The rat might gnaw the string, of which I held one end; other rats might gnaw it; the rat might run out of the pipe and leave the linen and money where they would never be found; a thousand other things might have happened.","So began some nervous hours, but the fact that the rat ran on until only a few feet of the string remained in my cell made me think he was outside the pipe.",I had carefully instructed Mr. Hatch what to do in case the note reached him.,The question was: Would it reach him?,"""This done, I could only wait and make other plans in case this one failed.","I openly attempted to bribe my jailer, and learned from him that he held the keys to only two of seven doors between me and freedom.",Then I did something else to make the warden nervous.,I took the steel supports out of the heels of my shoes and made a pretense of sawing the bars of my cell window.,The warden raised a pretty row about that.,"He developed, too, the habit of shaking the bars of my cell window to see if they were solid.","They were--then.""",Again the warden grinned.,He had ceased being astonished.,"""With this one plan I had done all I could and could only wait to see what happened,"" the scientist went on.","""I couldn't know whether my note had been delivered or even found, or whether the mouse had gnawed it up.",And I didn't dare to draw back through the pipe that one slender thread which connected me with the outside.,"""When I went to bed that night I didn't sleep, for fear there would come the slight signal twitch at the thread which was to tell me that Mr. Hatch had received the note.","At half-past three o'clock, I judge, I felt this twitch, and no prisoner actually under sentence of death ever welcomed a thing more heartily.""",The Thinking Machine stopped and turned to the reporter.,"""You'd better explain just what you did,"" he said.","""The linen note was brought to me by a small boy who had been playing baseball,"" said Mr. Hatch.","""I immediately saw a big story in it, so I gave the boy another ten dollars, and got several spools of silk, some twine, and a roll of light, pliable wire.","The professor's note suggested that I have the finder of the note show me just where it was picked up, and told me to make my search from there, beginning at two o'clock in the morning.","If I found the other end of the thread I was to twitch it gently three times, then a fourth.","""I began the search with a small bulb electric light.","It was an hour and twenty minutes before I found the end of the drain pipe, half hidden in weeds.","The pipe was very large there, say twelve inches across.","Then I found the end of the lisle thread, twitched it as directed and immediately I got an answering twitch.","""Then I fastened the silk to this and Professor Van Dusen began to pull it into his cell.",I nearly had heart disease for fear the string would break.,"To the end of the silk I fastened the twine, and when that had been pulled in I tied on the wire.","Then that was drawn into the pipe and we had a substantial line, which rats couldn't gnaw, from the mouth of the drain into the cell.""",The Thinking Machine raised his hand and Hatch stopped.,"""All this was done in absolute silence,"" said the scientist.","""But when the wire reached my hand I could have shouted.","Then we tried another experiment, which Mr. Hatch was prepared for.",I tested the pipe as a speaking tube.,"Neither of us could hear very clearly, but I dared not speak loud for fear of attracting attention in the prison.",At last I made him understand what I wanted immediately.,"He seemed to have great difficulty in understanding when I asked for nitric acid, and I repeated the word 'acid' several times.","""Then I heard a shriek from a cell above me.","I knew instantly that some one had overheard, and when I heard you coming, Mr.","Warden, I feigned sleep.",If you had entered my cell at that moment that whole plan of escape would have ended there.,But you passed on.,That was the nearest I ever came to being caught.,"""Having established this improvised trolley it is easy to see how I got things in the cell and made them disappear at will.",I merely dropped them back into the pipe.,"You, Mr.","Warden, could not have reached the connecting wire with your fingers; they are too large.","My fingers, you see, are longer and more slender.","In addition I guarded the top of that pipe with a rat--you remember how.""","""I remember,"" said the warden, with a grimace.","""I thought that if any one were tempted to investigate that hole the rat would dampen his ardor.","Mr. Hatch could not send me anything useful through the pipe until next night, although he did send me change for ten dollars as a test, so I proceeded with other parts of my plan.","Then I evolved the method of escape, which I finally employed.","""In order to carry this out successfully it was necessary for the guard in the yard to get accustomed to seeing me at the cell window.","I arranged this by dropping linen notes to him, boastful in tone, to make the warden believe, if possible, one of his assistants was communicating with the outside for me.","I would stand at my window for hours gazing out, so the guard could see, and occasionally I spoke to him.","In that way I learned that the prison had no electricians of its own, but was dependent upon the lighting company if anything should go wrong.","""That cleared the way to freedom perfectly: Early in the evening of the last day of my imprisonment, when it was dark, I planned to cut the feed wire which was only a few feet from my window, reaching it with an acid-tipped wire I had.",That would make that side of the prison perfectly dark while the electricians were searching for the break.,That would also bring Mr. Hatch into the prison yard.,"""There was only one more thing to do before I actually began the work of setting myself free.",This was to arrange final details with Mr. Hatch through our speaking tube.,I did this within half an hour after the warden left my cell on the fourth night of my imprisonment.,"Mr. Hatch again had serious difficulty in understanding me, and I repeated the word 'acid' to him several times, and later the words: 'Number eight hat'--that's my size--and these were the things which made a prisoner upstairs confess to murder, so one of the jailers told me next day.","This prisoner heard our voices, confused of course, through the pipe, which also went to his cell.","The cell directly over me was not occupied, hence no one else heard.","""Of course the actual work of cutting the steel bars out of the window and door was comparatively easy with nitric acid, which I got through the pipe in thin bottles, but it took time.",Hour after hour on the fifth and sixth and seventh days the guard below was looking at me as I worked on the bars of the window with the acid on a piece of wire.,I used the tooth powder to prevent the acid spreading.,I looked away abstractedly as I worked and each minute the acid cut deeper into the metal.,"I noticed that the jailers always tried the door by shaking the upper part, never the lower bars, therefore I cut the lower bars, leaving them hanging in place by thin strips of metal.",But that was a bit of dare-deviltry.,"I could not have gone that way so easily.""",The Thinking Machine sat silent for several minutes.,"""I think that makes everything clear,"" he went on.","""Whatever points I have not explained were merely to confuse the warden and jailers.","These things in my bed I brought in to please Mr. Hatch, who wanted to improve the story.","Of course, the wig was necessary in my plan.","The special delivery letter I wrote and directed in my cell with Mr. Hatch's fountain pen, then sent it out to him and he mailed it.","That's all, I think.""","""But your actually leaving the prison grounds and then coming in through the outer gate to my office?""",asked the warden.,"""Perfectly simple,"" said the scientist.","""I cut the electric light wire with acid, as I said, when the current was off.",Therefore when the current was turned on the arc didn't light.,I knew it would take some time to find out what was the matter and make repairs.,When the guard went to report to you the yard was dark.,"I crept out the window--it was a tight fit, too--replaced the bars by standing on a narrow ledge and remained in a shadow until the force of electricians arrived.",Mr. Hatch was one of them.,"""When I saw him I spoke and he handed me a cap, a jumper and overalls, which I put on within ten feet of you, Mr.","Warden, while you were in the yard.","Later Mr. Hatch called me, presumably as a workman, and together we went out the gate to get something out of the wagon.",The gate guard let us pass out readily as two workmen who had just passed in.,"We changed our clothing and reappeared, asking to see you.",We saw you.,"That's all.""",There was silence for several minutes.,Dr. Ransome was first to speak.,"""Wonderful!""",he exclaimed.,"""Perfectly amazing.""","""How did Mr. Hatch happen to come with the electricians?""",asked Mr.,Fielding.,"""His father is manager of the company,"" replied The Thinking Machine.","""But what if there had been no Mr. Hatch outside to help?""","""Every prisoner has one friend outside who would help him escape if he could.""","""Suppose--just suppose--there had been no old plumbing system there?""","asked the warden, curiously.","""There were two other ways out,"" said The Thinking Machine, enigmatically.",Ten minutes later the telephone bell rang.,It was a request for the warden.,"""Light all right, eh?""","the warden asked, through the 'phone.","""Good.",Wire cut beside Cell 13?,"Yes, I know.",One electrician too many?,What's that?,"Two came out?""",The warden turned to the others with a puzzled expression.,"""He only let in four electricians, he has let out two and says there are three left.""","""I was the odd one,"" said The Thinking Machine.","""Oh,"" said the warden.","""I see.""","Then through the 'phone ""Let the fifth man go.","He's all right.""",THE SCARLET THREAD I.,The Thinking Machine--Professor Augustus S. F. X.,"Van Dusen, Ph.D., LL.D., F.R.S., M.D., etc., scientist and logician--listened intently and without comment to a weird, seemingly inexplicable story.","Hutchinson Hatch, reporter, was telling it.",The bowed figure of the savant lay at ease in a large chair.,"The enormous head with its bushy yellow hair was thrown back, the thin, white fingers were pressed tip to tip and the blue eyes, narrowed to mere slits, squinted aggressively upward.",The scientist was in a receptive mood.,"""From the beginning, every fact you know,"" he had requested.","""It's all out in the Back Bay,"" the reporter explained.","""There is a big apartment house there, a fashionable establishment, in a side street, just off Commonwealth Avenue.","It is five stories in all, and is cut up into small suites, of two and three rooms with bath.","These suites are handsomely, even luxuriously furnished, and are occupied by people who can afford to pay big rents.","Generally these are young unmarried men, although in several cases they are husband and wife.","It is a house of every modern improvement, elevator service, hall boys, liveried door men, spacious corridors and all that.",It has both the gas and electric systems of lighting.,Tenants are at liberty to use either or both.,"""A young broker, Weldon Henley, occupies one of the handsomest of these suites, being on the second floor, in front.",He has met with considerable success in the Street.,He is a bachelor and lives there alone.,There is no personal servant.,"He dabbles in photography as a hobby, and is said to be remarkably expert.","""Recently there was a report that he was to be married this Winter to a beautiful Virginia girl who has been visiting Boston from time to time, a Miss Lipscomb--Charlotte Lipscomb, of Richmond.","Henley has never denied or affirmed this rumor, although he has been asked about it often.",Miss Lipscomb is impossible of access even when she visits Boston.,"Now she is in Virginia, I understand, but will return to Boston later in the season.""","The reporter paused, lighted a cigarette and leaned forward in his chair, gazing steadily into the inscrutable eyes of the scientist.","""When Henley took the suite he requested that all the electric lighting apparatus be removed from his apartments,"" he went on.","""He had taken a long lease of the place, and this was done.","Therefore he uses only gas for lighting purposes, and he usually keeps one of his gas jets burning low all night.""","""Bad, bad for his health,"" commented the scientist.","""Now comes the mystery of the affair,"" the reporter went on.","""It was five weeks or so ago Henley retired as usual--about midnight.",He locked his door on the inside--he is positive of that--and awoke about four o'clock in the morning nearly asphyxiated by gas.,He was barely able to get up and open the window to let in the fresh air.,"The gas jet he had left burning was out, and the suite was full of gas.""","""Accident, possibly,"" said The Thinking Machine.","""A draught through the apartments; a slight diminution of gas pressure; a hundred possibilities.""","""So it was presumed,"" said the reporter.","""Of course it would have been impossible for----"" ""Nothing is impossible,"" said the other, tartly.","""Don't say that.","It annoys me exceedingly.""","""Well, then, it seems highly improbable that the door had been opened or that anyone came into the room and did this deliberately,"" the newspaper man went on, with a slight smile.","""So Henley said nothing about this; attributed it to accident.","The next night he lighted his gas as usual, but he left it burning a little brighter.","The same thing happened again.""","""Ah,"" and The Thinking Machine changed his position a little.","""The second time.""","""And again he awoke just in time to save himself,"" said Hatch.","""Still he attributed the affair to accident, and determined to avoid a recurrence of the affair by doing away with the gas at night.","Then he got a small night lamp and used this for a week or more.""","""Why does he have a light at all?""","asked the scientist, testily.","""I can hardly answer that,"" replied Hatch.","""I may say, however, that he is of a very nervous temperament, and gets up frequently during the night.",He reads occasionally when he can't sleep.,"In addition to that he has slept with a light going all his life; it's a habit.""","""Go on.""","""One night he looked for the night lamp, but it had disappeared--at least he couldn't find it--so he lighted the gas again.",The fact of the gas having twice before gone out had been dismissed as a serious possibility.,"Next morning at five o'clock a bell boy, passing through the hall, smelled gas and made a quick investigation.","He decided it came from Henley's place, and rapped on the door.",There was no answer.,It ultimately developed that it was necessary to smash in the door.,There on the bed they found Henley unconscious with the gas pouring into the room from the jet which he had left lighted.,"He was revived in the air, but for several hours was deathly sick.""","""Why was the door smashed in?""",asked The Thinking Machine.,"""Why not unlocked?""","""It was done because Henley had firmly barred it,"" Hatch explained.","""He had become suspicious, I suppose, and after the second time he always barred his door and fastened every window before he went to sleep.","There may have been a fear that some one used a key to enter.""","""Well?""",asked the scientist.,"""After that?""","""Three weeks or so elapsed, bringing the affair down to this morning,"" Hatch went on.","""Then the same thing happened a little differently.","For instance, after the third time the gas went out Henley decided to find out for himself what caused it, and so expressed himself to a few friends who knew of the mystery.","Then, night after night, he lighted the gas as usual and kept watch.","It was never disturbed during all that time, burning steadily all night.",What sleep he got was in daytime.,"""Last night Henley lay awake for a time; then, exhausted and tired, fell asleep.",This morning early he awoke; the room was filled with gas again.,"In some way my city editor heard of it and asked me to look into the mystery.""",That was all.,"The two men were silent for a long time, and finally The Thinking Machine turned to the reporter.","""Does anyone else in the house keep gas going all night?""",he asked.,"""I don't know,"" was the reply.","""Most of them, I know, use electricity.""","""Nobody else has been overcome as he has been?""","""No.","Plumbers have minutely examined the lighting system all over the house and found nothing wrong.""","""Does the gas in the house all come through the same meter?""","""Yes, so the manager told me.","This meter, a big one, is just off the engine room.","I supposed it possible that some one shut it off there on these nights long enough to extinguish the lights all over the house, then turned it on again.","That is, presuming that it was done purposely.","Do you think it was an attempt to kill Henley?""","""It might be,"" was the reply.","""Find out for me just who in the house uses gas; also if anyone else leaves a light burning all night; also what opportunity anyone would have to get at the meter, and then something about Henley's love affair with Miss Lipscomb.",Is there anyone else?,"If so, who?",Where does he live?,"When you find out these things come back here.""","*     *     *     *     * That afternoon at one o'clock Hatch returned to the apartments of The Thinking Machine, with excitement plainly apparent on his face.","""Well?""",asked the scientist.,"""A French girl, Louise Regnier, employed as a maid by Mrs.","Standing in the house, was found dead in her room on the third floor to-day at noon,"" Hatch explained quickly.","""It looks like suicide.""","""How?""",asked The Thinking Machine.,"""The people who employed her--husband and wife--have been away for a couple of days,"" Hatch rushed on.","""She was in the suite alone.","This noon she had not appeared, there was an odor of gas and the door was broken in.","Then she was found dead.""","""With the gas turned on?""","""With the gas turned on.","She was asphyxiated.""","""Dear me, dear me,"" exclaimed the scientist.",He arose and took up his hat.,"""Let's go see what this is all about.""",II.,When Professor Van Dusen and Hatch arrived at the apartment house they had been preceded by the Medical Examiner and the police.,"Detective Mallory, whom both knew, was moving about in the apartment where the girl had been found dead.",The body had been removed and a telegram sent to her employers in New York.,"""Too late,"" said Mallory, as they entered.","""What was it, Mr.","Mallory?""",asked the scientist.,"""Suicide,"" was the reply.","""No question of it.","It happened in this room,"" and he led the way into the third room of the suite.","""The maid, Miss Regnier, occupied this, and was here alone last night.",Mr. and Mrs.,"Standing, her employers, have gone to New York for a few days.","She was left alone, and killed herself.""","Without further questioning The Thinking Machine went over to the bed, from which the girl's body had been taken, and, stooping beside it, picked up a book.","It was a novel by ""The Duchess.""","He examined this critically, then, standing on a chair, he examined the gas jet.","This done, he stepped down and went to the window of the little room.",Finally The Thinking Machine turned to the detective.,"""Just how much was the gas turned on?""",he asked.,"""Turned on full,"" was the reply.","""Were both the doors of the room closed?""","""Both, yes.""","""Any cotton, or cloth, or anything of the sort stuffed in the cracks of the window?""","""No.","It's a tight-fitting window, anyway.","Are you trying to make a mystery out of this?""","""Cracks in the doors stuffed?""",The Thinking Machine went on.,"""No.""",There was a smile about the detective's lips.,"The Thinking Machine, on his knees, examined the bottom of one of the doors, that which led into the hall.",The lock of this door had been broken when employees burst into the room.,"Having satisfied himself here and at the bottom of the other door, which connected with the bedroom adjoining, The Thinking Machine again climbed on a chair and examined the doors at the top.","""Both transoms closed, I suppose?""",he asked.,"""Yes,"" was the reply.","""You can't make anything but suicide out of it,"" explained the detective.","""The Medical Examiner has given that as his opinion--and everything I find indicates it.""","""All right,"" broke in The Thinking Machine abruptly.","""Don't let us keep you.""",After awhile Detective Mallory went away.,"Hatch and the scientist went down to the office floor, where they saw the manager.","He seemed to be greatly distressed, but was willing to do anything he could in the matter.","""Is your night engineer perfectly trustworthy?""",asked The Thinking Machine.,"""Perfectly,"" was the reply.","""One of the best and most reliable men I ever met.","Alert and wide-awake.""","""Can I see him a moment?","The night man, I mean?""","""Certainly,"" was the reply.","""He's downstairs.",He sleeps there.,He's probably up by this time.,"He sleeps usually till one o'clock in the daytime, being up all night.""","""Do you supply gas for your tenants?""","""Both gas and electricity are included in the rent of the suites.","Tenants may use one or both.""","""And the gas all comes through one meter?""","""Yes, one meter.","It's just off the engine room.""","""I suppose there's no way of telling just who in the house uses gas?""","""No.",Some do and some don't.,"I don't know.""",This was what Hatch had told the scientist.,"Now together they went to the basement, and there met the night engineer, Charles Burlingame, a tall, powerful, clean-cut man, of alert manner and positive speech.","He gazed with a little amusement at the slender, almost childish figure of The Thinking Machine and the grotesquely large head.","""You are in the engine room or near it all night every night?""",began The Thinking Machine.,"""I haven't missed a night in four years,"" was the reply.","""Anybody ever come here to see you at night?""","""Never.","It's against the rules.""","""The manager or a hall boy?""","""Never.""","""In the last two months?""",The Thinking Machine persisted.,"""Not in the last two years,"" was the positive reply.","""I go on duty every night at seven o'clock, and I am on duty until seven in the morning.","I don't believe I've seen anybody in the basement here with me between those hours for a year at least.""","The Thinking Machine was squinting steadily into the eyes of the engineer, and for a time both were silent.","Hatch moved about the scrupulously clean engine room and nodded to the day engineer, who sat leaning back against the wall.",Directly in front of him was the steam gauge.,"""Have you a fireman?""",was The Thinking Machine's next question.,"""No.","I fire myself,"" said the night man.","""Here's the coal,"" and he indicated a bin within half a dozen feet of the mouth of the boiler.","""I don't suppose you ever had occasion to handle the gas meter?""",insisted The Thinking Machine.,"""Never touched it in my life,"" said the other.","""I don't know anything about meters, anyway.""","""And you never drop off to sleep at night for a few minutes when you get lonely?","Doze, I mean?""",The engineer grinned good-naturedly.,"""Never had any desire to, and besides I wouldn't have the chance,"" he explained.","""There's a time check here,""--and he indicated it.","""I have to punch that every half hour all night to prove that I have been awake.""","""Dear me, dear me,"" exclaimed The Thinking Machine, irritably.","He went over and examined the time check--a revolving paper disk with hours marked on it, made to move by the action of a clock, the face of which showed in the middle.","""Besides there's the steam gauge to watch,"" went on the engineer.","""No engineer would dare go to sleep.","There might be an explosion.""","""Do you know Mr. Weldon Henley?""",suddenly asked The Thinking Machine.,"""Who?""",asked Burlingame.,"""Weldon Henley?""","""No-o,"" was the slow response.","""Never heard of him.","Who is he?""","""One of the tenants, on the second floor, I think.""","""Lord, I don't know any of the tenants.","What about him?""","""When does the inspector come here to read the meter?""","""I never saw him.","I presume in daytime, eh Bill?""",and he turned to the day engineer.,"""Always in daytime--usually about noon,"" said Bill from his corner.","""Any other entrance to the basement except this way--and you could see anyone coming here this way I suppose?""","""Sure I could see 'em.","There's no other entrance to the cellar except the coal hole in the sidewalk in front.""","""Two big electric lights in front of the building, aren't there?""","""Yes.","They go all night.""",A slightly puzzled expression crept into the eyes of The Thinking Machine.,Hatch knew from the persistency of the questions that he was not satisfied; yet he was not able to fathom or to understand all the queries.,In some way they had to do with the possibility of some one having access to the meter.,"""Where do you usually sit at night here?""",was the next question.,"""Over there where Bill's sitting.","I always sit there.""","The Thinking Machine crossed the room to Bill, a typical, grimy-handed man of his class.","""May I sit there a moment?""",he asked.,"Bill arose lazily, and The Thinking Machine sank down into the chair.",From this point he could see plainly through the opening into the basement proper--there was no door--the gas meter of enormous proportions through which all the gas in the house passed.,An electric light in the door made it bright as daylight.,"The Thinking Machine noted these things, arose, nodded his thanks to the two men and, still with the puzzled expression on his face, led the way upstairs.",There the manager was still in his office.,"""I presume you examine and know that the time check in the engineer's room is properly punched every half-hour during the night?""",he asked.,"""Yes.","I examine the dial every day--have them here, in fact, each with the date on it.""","""May I see them?""",Now the manager was puzzled.,"He produced the cards, one for each day, and for half an hour The Thinking Machine studied them minutely.","At the end of that time, when he arose and Hatch looked at him inquiringly, he saw still the perplexed expression.","After urgent solicitation, the manager admitted them to the apartments of Weldon Henley.",Mr. Henley himself had gone to his office in State Street.,"Here The Thinking Machine did several things which aroused the curiosity of the manager, one of which was to minutely study the gas jets.",Then The Thinking Machine opened one of the front windows and glanced out into the street.,"Below fifteen feet was the sidewalk; above was the solid front of the building, broken only by a flagpole which, properly roped, extended from the hall window of the next floor above out over the sidewalk a distance of twelve feet or so.","""Ever use that flagpole?""",he asked the manager.,"""Rarely,"" said the manager.","""On holidays sometimes--Fourth of July and such times.","We have a big flag for it.""","From the apartments The Thinking Machine led the way to the hall, up the stairs and to the flagpole.","Leaning out of this window, he looked down toward the window of the apartments he had just left.","Then he inspected the rope of the flagpole, drawing it through his slender hands slowly and carefully.",At last he picked off a slender thread of scarlet and examined it.,"""Ah,"" he exclaimed.","Then to Hatch: ""Let's go, Mr. Hatch.","Thank you,"" this last to the manager, who had been a puzzled witness.","Once on the street, side by side with The Thinking Machine, Hatch was bursting with questions, but he didn't ask them.",He knew it would be useless.,At last The Thinking Machine broke the silence.,"""That girl, Miss Regnier, _was murdered_,"" he said suddenly, positively.","""There have been four attempts to murder Henley.""","""How?""","asked Hatch, startled.","""By a scheme so simple that neither you nor I nor the police have ever heard of it being employed,"" was the astonishing reply.","""_It is perfectly horrible in its simplicity_.""","""What was it?""","Hatch insisted, eagerly.","""It would be futile to discuss that now,"" was the rejoinder.","""There has been murder.",We know how.,Now the question is--who?,"What person would have a motive to kill Henley?""",III.,There was a pause as they walked on.,"""Where are we going?""",asked Hatch finally.,"""Come up to my place and let's consider this matter a bit further,"" replied The Thinking Machine.","Not another word was spoken by either until half an hour later, in the small laboratory.",For a long time the scientist was thoughtful--deeply thoughtful.,Once he took down a volume from a shelf and Hatch glanced at the title.,"It was ""Gases: Their Properties.""","After awhile he returned this to the shelf and took down another, on which the reporter caught the title, ""Anatomy.""","""Now, Mr. Hatch,"" said The Thinking Machine in his perpetually crabbed voice, ""we have a most remarkable riddle.",It gains this remarkable aspect from its very simplicity.,"It is not, however, necessary to go into that now.",I will make it clear to you when we know the motives.,"""As a general rule, the greatest crimes never come to light because the greatest criminals, their perpetrators, are too clever to be caught.","Here we have what I might call a great crime committed with a subtle simplicity that is wholly disarming, and a greater crime even than this was planned.",This was to murder Weldon Henley.,The first thing for you to do is to see Mr. Henley and warn him of his danger.,"Asphyxiation will not be attempted again, but there is a possibility of poison, a pistol shot, a knife, anything almost.","As a matter of fact, he is in great peril.","""Superficially, the death of Miss Regnier, the maid, looks to be suicide.",Instead it is the fruition of a plan which has been tried time and again against Henley.,"There is a possibility that Miss Regnier was not an intentional victim of the plot, but the fact remains that she was murdered.",Why?,"Find the motive for the plot to murder Mr. Henley and you will know why.""","The Thinking Machine reached over to the shelf, took a book, looked at it a moment, then went on: ""The first question to determine positively is: Who hated Weldon Henley sufficiently to desire his death?",You say he is a successful man in the Street.,"Therefore there is a possibility that some enemy there is at the bottom of the affair, yet it seems hardly probable.",If by his operations Mr. Henley ever happened to wreck another man's fortune find this man and find out all about him.,He may be the man.,There will be innumerable questions arising from this line of inquiry to a man of your resources.,Leave none of them unanswered.,"""On the other hand there is Henley's love affair.",Had he a rival who might desire his death?,Had he any rival?,"If so, find out all about him.",He may be the man who planned all this.,"Here, too, there will be questions arising which demand answers.",Answer them--all of them--fully and clearly before you see me again.,"""Was Henley ever a party to a liaison of any kind?","Find that out, too.","A vengeful woman or a discarded sweetheart of a vengeful woman, you know, will go to any extreme.","The rumor of his engagement to Miss--Miss----"" ""Miss Lipscomb,"" Hatch supplied.","""The rumor of his engagement to Miss Lipscomb might have caused a woman whom he had once been interested in or who was once interested in him to attempt his life.","The subtler murders--that is, the ones which are most attractive as problems--are nearly always the work of a cunning woman.","I know nothing about women myself,"" he hastened to explain; ""but Lombroso has taken that attitude.","Therefore, see if there is a woman.""",Most of these points Hatch had previously seen--seen with the unerring eye of a clever newspaper reporter--yet there were several which had not occurred to him.,He nodded his understanding.,"""Now the center of the affair, of course,"" The Thinking Machine continued, ""is the apartment house where Henley lives.","The person who attempted his life either lives there or has ready access to the place, and frequently spends the night there.",This is a vital question for you to answer.,I am leaving all this to you because you know better how to do these things than I do.,"That's all, I think.","When these things are all learned come back to me.""","The Thinking Machine arose as if the interview were at an end, and Hatch also arose, reluctantly.",An idea was beginning to dawn in his mind.,"""Does it occur to you that there is any connection whatever between Henley and Miss Regnier?""",he asked.,"""It is possible,"" was the reply.","""I had thought of that.","If there is a connection it is not apparent yet.""","""Then how--how was it she--she was killed, or killed herself, whichever may be true, and----"" ""The attempt to kill Henley killed her.","That's all I can say now.""","""That all?""","asked Hatch, after a pause.","""No.",Warn Mr. Henley immediately that he is in grave danger.,Remember the person who has planned this will probably go to any extreme.,"I don't know Mr. Henley, of course, but from the fact that he always had a light at night I gather that he is a timid sort of man--not necessarily a coward, but a man lacking in stamina--therefore, one who might better disappear for a week or so until the mystery is cleared up.","Above all, impress upon him the importance of the warning.""",The Thinking Machine opened his pocketbook and took from it the scarlet thread which he had picked from the rope of the flagpole.,"""Here, I believe, is the real clew to the problem,"" he explained to Hatch.","""What does it seem to be?""",Hatch examined it closely.,"""I should say a strand from a Turkish bath robe,"" was his final judgment.","""Possibly.","Ask some cloth expert what he makes of it, then if it sounds promising look into it.","Find out if by any possibility it can be any part of any garment worn by any person in the apartment house.""","""But it's so slight----"" Hatch began.","""I know,"" the other interrupted, tartly.","""It's slight, but I believe it is a part of the wearing apparel of the person, man or woman, who has four times attempted to kill Mr. Henley and who did kill the girl.","Therefore, it is important.""",Hatch looked at him quickly.,"""Well, how--in what manner--did it come where you found it?""","""Simple enough,"" said the scientist.","""It is a wonder that there were not more pieces of it--that's all.""","Perplexed by his instructions, but confident of results, Hatch left The Thinking Machine.","What possible connection could this tiny bit of scarlet thread, found on a flagpole, have with some one shutting off the gas in Henley's rooms?",How did any one go into Henley's rooms to shut off the gas?,How was it Miss Regnier was dead?,What was the manner of her death?,"A cloth expert in a great department store turned his knowledge on the tiny bit of scarlet for the illumination of Hatch, but he could go no further than to say that it seemed to be part of a Turkish bath robe.","""Man or woman's?""",asked Hatch.,"""The material from which bath robes are made is the same for both men and women,"" was the reply.","""I can say nothing else.","Of course there's not enough of it to even guess at the pattern of the robe.""","Then Hatch went to the financial district and was ushered into the office of Weldon Henley, a slender, handsome man of thirty-two or three years, pallid of face and nervous in manner.","He still showed the effect of the gas poisoning, and there was even a trace of a furtive fear--fear of something, he himself didn't know what--in his actions.","Henley talked freely to the newspaper man of certain things, but of other things was resentfully reticent.","He admitted his engagement to Miss Lipscomb, and finally even admitted that Miss Lipscomb's hand had been sought by another man, Regnault Cabell, formerly of Virginia.","""Could you give me his address?""",asked Hatch.,"""He lives in the same apartment house with me--two floors above,"" was the reply.",Hatch was startled; startled more than he would have cared to admit.,"""Are you on friendly terms with him?""",he asked.,"""Certainly,"" said Henley.","""I won't say anything further about this matter.","It would be unwise for obvious reasons.""","""I suppose you consider that this turning on of the gas was an attempt on your life?""","""I can't suppose anything else.""",Hatch studied the pallid face closely as he asked the next question.,"""Do you know Miss Regnier was found dead to-day?""","""Dead?""","exclaimed the other, and he arose.","""Who--what--who is she?""",It seemed a distinct effort for him to regain control of himself.,"The reporter detailed then the circumstances of the finding of the girl's body, and the broker listened without comment.",From that time forward all the reporter's questions were either parried or else met with a flat refusal to answer.,"Finally Hatch repeated to him the warning which he had from The Thinking Machine, and feeling that he had accomplished little, went away.","At eight o'clock that night--a night of complete darkness--Henley was found unconscious, lying in a little used walk in the Common.","There was a bullet hole through his left shoulder, and he was bleeding profusely.","He was removed to the hospital, where he regained consciousness for just a moment.","""Who shot you?""",he was asked.,"""None of your business,"" he replied, and lapsed into unconsciousness.",IV.,"Entirely unaware of this latest attempt on the life of the broker, Hutchinson Hatch steadily pursued his investigations.",They finally led him to an intimate friend of Regnault Cabell.,"The young Southerner had apartments on the fourth floor of the big house off Commonwealth Avenue, directly over those Henley occupied, but two flights higher up.",This friend was a figure in the social set of the Back Bay.,He talked to Hatch freely of Cabell.,"""He's a good fellow,"" he explained, ""one of the best I ever met, and comes of one of the best families Virginia ever had--a true F. F. V. He's pretty quick tempered and all that, but an excellent chap, and everywhere he has gone here he has made friends.""","""He used to be in love with Miss Lipscomb of Virginia, didn't he?""","asked Hatch, casually.","""Used to be?""",the other repeated with a laugh.,"""He is in love with her.","But recently he understood that she was engaged to Weldon Henley, a broker--you may have heard of him?--and that, I suppose, has dampened his ardor considerably.","As a matter of fact, Cabell took the thing to heart.","He used to know Miss Lipscomb in Virginia--she comes from another famous family there--and he seemed to think he had a prior claim on her.""","Hatch heard all these things as any man might listen to gossip, but each additional fact was sinking into his mind, and each additional fact led his suspicions on deeper into the channel they had chosen.","""Cabell is pretty well to do,"" his informant went on, ""not rich as we count riches in the North, but pretty well to do, and I believe he came to Boston because Miss Lipscomb spent so much of her time here.","She is a beautiful young woman of twenty-two and extremely popular in the social world everywhere, particularly in Boston.","Then there was the additional fact that Henley was here.""","""No chance at all for Cabell?""",Hatch suggested.,"""Not the slightest,"" was the reply.","""Yet despite the heartbreak he had, he was the first to congratulate Henley on winning her love.","And he meant it, too.""","""What's his attitude toward Henley now?""",asked Hatch.,"His voice was calm, but there was an underlying tense note imperceptible to the other.","""They meet and speak and move in the same set.","There's no love lost on either side, I don't suppose, but there is no trace of any ill feeling.""","""Cabell doesn't happen to be a vindictive sort of man?""","""Vindictive?""",and the other laughed.,"""No.","He's like a big boy, forgiving, and all that; hot-tempered, though.","I could imagine him in a fit of anger making a personal matter of it with Henley, but I don't think he ever did.""","The mind of the newspaper man was rapidly focusing on one point; the rush of thoughts, questions and doubts silenced him for a moment.","Then: ""How long has Cabell been in Boston?""","""Seven or eight months--that is, he has had apartments here for that long--but he has made several visits South.",I suppose it's South.,He has a trick of dropping out of sight occasionally.,I understand that he intends to go South for good very soon.,"If I'm not mistaken, he is trying now to rent his suite.""",Hatch looked suddenly at his informant; an idea of seeing Cabell and having a legitimate excuse for talking to him had occurred to him.,"""I'm looking for a suite,"" he volunteered at last.","""I wonder if you would give me a card of introduction to him?","We might get together on it.""","Thus it happened that half an hour later, about ten minutes past nine o'clock, Hatch was on his way to the big apartment house.",In the office he saw the manager.,"""Heard the news?""",asked the manager.,"""No,"" Hatch replied.","""What is it?""","""Somebody's shot Mr. Henley as he was passing through the Common early to-night.""",Hatch whistled his amazement.,"""Is he dead?""","""No, but he is unconscious.","The hospital doctors say it is a nasty wound, but not necessarily dangerous.""","""Who shot him?","Do they know?""","""He knows, but he won't say.""","Amazed and alarmed by this latest development, an accurate fulfillment of The Thinking Machine's prophecy, Hatch stood thoughtful for a moment, then recovering his composure a little asked for Cabell.","""I don't think there's much chance of seeing him,"" said the manager.","""He's going away on the midnight train--going South, to Virginia.""","""Going away to-night?""",Hatch gasped.,"""Yes; it seems to have been rather a sudden determination.","He was talking to me here half an hour or so ago, and said something about going away.",While he was here the telephone boy told me that Henley had been shot; they had 'phoned from the hospital to inform us.,Then Cabell seemed greatly agitated.,"He said he was going away to-night, if he could catch the midnight train, and now he's packing.""","""I suppose the shooting of Henley upset him considerably?""",the reporter suggested.,"""Yes, I guess it did,"" was the reply.","""They moved in the same set and belonged to the same clubs.""",The manager sent Hatch's card of introduction to Cabell's apartments.,Hatch went up and was ushered into a suite identical with that of Henley's in every respect save in minor details of furnishings.,"Cabell stood in the middle of the floor, with his personal belongings scattered about the room; his valet, evidently a Frenchman, was busily engaged in packing.",Cabell's greeting was perfunctorily cordial; he seemed agitated.,"His face was flushed and from time to time he ran his fingers through his long, brown hair.","He stared at Hatch in a preoccupied fashion, then they fell into conversation about the rent of the apartments.","""I'll take almost anything reasonable,"" Cabell said hurriedly.","""You see, I am going away to-night, rather more suddenly than I had intended, and I am anxious to get the lease off my hands.","I pay two hundred dollars a month for these just as they are.""","""May I look them over?""",asked Hatch.,He passed from the front room into the next.,"Here, on a bed, was piled a huge lot of clothing, and the valet, with deft fingers, was brushing and folding, preparatory to packing.",Cabell was directly behind him.,"""Quite comfortable, you see,"" he explained.","""There's room enough if you are alone.","Are you?""","""Oh, yes,"" Hatch replied.","""This other room here,"" Cabell explained, ""is not in very tidy shape now.","I have been out of the city for several weeks, and---- What's the matter?""",he demanded suddenly.,"Hatch had turned quickly at the words and stared at him, then recovered himself with a start.","""I beg your pardon,"" he stammered.","""I rather thought I saw you in town here a week or so ago--of course I didn't know you--and I was wondering if I could have been mistaken.""","""Must have been,"" said the other easily.","""During the time I was away a Miss----, a friend of my sister's, occupied the suite.",I'm afraid some of her things are here.,She hasn't sent for them as yet.,"She occupied this room, I think;

scientist, and he slipped a finger beneath the flap of the envelope.","""It's clear now.","It was an engaging problem from first to last, and now----"" He opened the telegram and glanced at it; then with bewilderment on his face and mouth slightly open he sank down at the table and leaned forward with his head on his arms.","The message fluttered to the table and Hatch read this: ""Man in Boston can't be my husband.",He is now in Honolulu.,I received cablegram from him to-day.,"""Mrs. Preston Bell.""",VI.,It was thirty-six hours later that the three men met again.,The Thinking Machine had abruptly dismissed Hatch and Doane the last time.,The reporter knew that something wholly unexpected had happened.,He could only conjecture that this had to do with Preston Bell.,When the three met again it was in Detective Mallory's office at police headquarters.,"The mysterious woman who had claimed Doane for her husband was present, as were Mallory, Hatch, Doane and The Thinking Machine.","""Has this woman given any name?""",was the scientist's first question.,"""Mary Jones,"" replied the detective, with a grin.","""And address?""","""No.""","""Is her picture in the Rogues' Gallery?""","""No.","I looked carefully.""","""Anybody called to ask about her?""","""A man--yes.","That is, he didn't ask about her--he merely asked some general questions, which now we believe were to find out about her.""",The Thinking Machine arose and walked over to the woman.,She looked up at him defiantly.,"""There has been a mistake made, Mr. Mallory,"" said the scientist.","""It's my fault entirely.",Let this woman go.,"I am sorry to have done her so grave an injustice.""","Instantly the woman was on her feet, her face radiant.",A look of disgust crept into Mallory's face.,"""I can't let her go now without arraignment,"" the detective growled.","""It ain't regular.""","""You must let her go, Mr. Mallory,"" commanded The Thinking Machine, and over the woman's shoulder the detective saw an astonishing thing.",The Thinking Machine winked.,"It was a decided, long, pronounced wink.","""Oh, all right,"" he said, ""but it ain't regular at that.""","The woman passed out of the room hurriedly, her silken skirts rustling loudly.",She was free again.,Immediately she disappeared The Thinking Machine's entire manner changed.,"""Put your best man to follow her,"" he directed rapidly.","""Let him go to her home and arrest the man who is with her as her husband.","Then bring them both back here, after searching their rooms for money.""","""Why--what--what is all this?""","demanded Mallory, amazed.","""The man who inquired for her, who is with her, is wanted for a $175,000 embezzlement in Butte, Montana.","Don't let your man lose sight of her.""",The detective left the room hurriedly.,Ten minutes later he returned to find The Thinking Machine leaning back in his chair with eyes upturned.,"Hatch and Doane were waiting, both impatiently.","""Now, Mr. Mallory,"" said the scientist, ""I shall try to make this matter as clear to you as it is to me.",By the time I finish I expect your man will be back here with this woman and the embezzler.,His name is Harrison; I don't know hers.,"I can't believe she is Mrs. Harrison, yet he has, I suppose, a wife.",But here's the story.,"It is the chaining together of fact after fact; a necessary logical sequence to a series of incidents, which are, separately, deeply puzzling.""",The detective lighted a cigar and the others disposed themselves comfortably to listen.,"""This gentleman came to me,"" began The Thinking Machine, ""with a story of loss of memory.","He told me that he knew neither his name, home, occupation, nor anything whatever about himself.",At the moment it struck me as a case for a mental expert; still I was interested.,"It seemed to be a remarkable case of aphasia, and I so regarded it until he told me that he had $10,000 in bills, that he had no watch, that everything which might possibly be of value in establishing his identity had been removed from his clothing.",This included even the names of the makers of his linen.,"That showed intent, deliberation.","""Then I knew it could _not_ be aphasia.","That disease strikes a man suddenly as he walks the street, as he sleeps, as he works, but never gives any desire to remove traces of one's identity.","On the contrary, a man is still apparently sound mentally--he has merely forgotten something--and usually his first desire is to find out who he is.","This gentleman had that desire, and in trying to find some clew he showed a mind capable of grasping at every possible opportunity.",Nearly every question I asked had been anticipated.,Thus I recognized that he must be a more than usually astute man.,"""But if not aphasia, what was it?",What caused his condition?,A drug?,"I remembered that there was such a drug in India, not unlike hasheesh.",Therefore for the moment I assumed a drug.,It gave me a working basis.,Then what did I have?,"A man of striking mentality who was the victim of some sort of plot, who had been drugged until he lost himself, and in that way disposed of.","The handwriting might be the same, for handwriting is rarely affected by a mental disorder; it is a physical function.","""So far, so good.",I examined his head for a possible accident.,Nothing.,His hands were white and in no way calloused.,"Seeking to reconcile the fact that he had been a man of strong mentality, with all other things a financier or banker, occurred to me.","The same things might have indicated a lawyer, but the poise of this man, his elaborate care in dress, all these things made me think him the financier rather than the lawyer.","""Then I examined some money he had when he awoke.",Fifteen or sixteen of the hundred-dollar bills were new and in sequence.,They were issued by a national bank.,To whom?,The possibilities were that the bank would have a record.,"I wired, asking about this, and also asked Mr. Hatch to have his correspondents make inquiries in various cities for a John Doane.",It was not impossible that John Doane was his name.,"Now I believe it will be safe for me to say that when he registered at the hotel he was drugged, his own name slipped his mind, and he signed John Doane--the first name that came to him.",That is _not_ his name.,"""While waiting an answer from the bank I tried to arouse his memory by referring to things in the West.",It appeared possible that he might have brought the money from the West with him.,"Then, still with the idea that he was a financier, I sent him to the financial district.",There was a result.,"The word 'copper' aroused him so that he fainted after shouting, 'Sell copper, sell, sell, sell.'","""In a way my estimate of the man was confirmed.","He was or had been in a copper deal, selling copper in the market, or planning to do so.",I know nothing of the intricacies of the stock market.,But there came instantly to me the thought that a man who would faint away in such a case must be vitally interested as well as ill.,"Thus I had a financier, in a copper deal, drugged as result of a conspiracy.","Do you follow me, Mr.","Mallory?""","""Sure,"" was the reply.","""At this point I received a telegram from the Butte bank telling me that the hundred-dollar bills I asked about had been burned.","This telegram was signed 'Preston Bell, Cashier.'","If that were true, the bills this man had were counterfeit.",There were no ifs about that.,I asked him if he knew Preston Bell.,It was the only name of a person to arouse him in any way.,A man knows his own name better than anything in the world.,Therefore was it his?,For a moment I presumed it was.,"""Thus the case stood: Preston Bell, cashier of the Butte bank, had been drugged, was the victim of a conspiracy, which was probably a part of some great move in copper.","But if this man were _Preston Bell_, how came the signature there?",Part of the office regulation?,"It happens hundreds of times that a name is so used, particularly on telegrams.","""Well, this man who was lost--Doane, or Preston Bell--went to sleep in my apartments.","At that time I believed it fully possible that he was a counterfeiter, as the bills were supposedly burned, and sent Mr. Hatch to consult an expert.",I also wired for details of the fire loss in Butte and names of persons who had any knowledge of the matter.,"This done, I removed and examined this gentleman's shoes for the name of the maker.",I found it.,"The shoes were of fine quality, probably made to order for him.","""Remember, at this time I believed this gentleman to be Preston Bell, for reasons I have stated.","I wired to the maker or retailer to know if he had a record of a sale of the shoes, describing them in detail, to any financier or banker.",I also wired to the Denver police to know if any financier or banker had been away from there for four or five weeks.,"Then came the somewhat startling information, through Mr. Hatch, that the hundred-dollar bills were genuine.","That answer meant that Preston Bell--as I had begun to think of him--was either a thief or the victim of some sort of financial conspiracy.""",During the silence which followed every eye was turned on the man who was lost--Doane or Preston Bell.,He sat staring straight ahead of him with hands nervously clenched.,On his face was written the sign of a desperate mental struggle.,He was still trying to recall the past.,"""Then,"" The Thinking Machine resumed, ""I heard from the Denver police.",There was no leading financier or banker out of the city so far as they could learn hurriedly.,"It was not conclusive, but it aided me.","Also I received another telegram from Butte, signed Preston Bell, telling me the circumstances of the supposed burning of the hundred-dollar bills.",It did not show that they were burned at all; it was merely an assumption that they had been.,"They were last seen in President Harrison's office.""","""Harrison, Harrison, Harrison,"" repeated Doane.","""Vaguely I could see the possibility of something financially wrong in the bank.","Possibly Harrison, even Mr. Bell here, knew of it.",Banks do not apply for permission to reissue bills unless they are positive of the original loss.,Yet here were the bills.,Obviously some sort of jugglery.,"I wired to the police of Butte, asking some questions.","The answer was that Harrison had embezzled $175,000 and had disappeared.","Now I knew he had part of the missing, supposedly burned, bills with him.",It was obvious.,Was Bell also a thief?,"""The same telegram said that Mr. Bell's reputation was of the best, and he was out of the city.","That confirmed my belief that it was an office rule to sign telegrams with the cashier's name, and further made me positive that this man was Preston Bell.",The chain of circumstances was complete.,"It was two and two--inevitable result, four.","""Now, what was the plot?","Something to do with copper, and there was an embezzlement.","Then, still seeking a man who knew Bell personally, I sent him out walking with Hatch.",I had done so before.,Suddenly another figure came into the mystery--a confusing one at the moment.,"This was a Mr. Manning, who knew Doane, or Bell, as Harry--something; met him in Pittsburg three years ago, in the Lincoln Club.","""It was just after Mr. Hatch told me of this man that I received a telegram from the shoemaker in Denver.",It said that he had made a shoe such as I described within a few months for Preston Bell.,I had asked if a sale had been made to a financier or banker; I got the name back by wire.,"""At this point a woman appeared to claim John Doane as her husband.","With no definite purpose, save general precaution, I asked Mr. Hatch to see her first.","She imagined he was Doane and embraced him, calling him John.",Therefore she was a fraud.,"She did not know John Doane, or Preston Bell, by sight.",Was she acting under the direction of some one else?,"If so, whose?""",There was a pause as The Thinking Machine readjusted himself in the chair.,"After a time he went on: ""There are shades of emotion, intuition, call it what you will, so subtle that it is difficult to express them in words.",As I had instinctively associated Harrison with Bell's present condition I instinctively associated this woman with Harrison.,For not a word of the affair had appeared in a newspaper; only a very few persons knew of it.,"Was it possible that the stranger Manning was backing the woman in an effort to get the $10,000?",That remained to be seen.,I questioned the woman; she would say nothing.,"She is clever, but she blundered badly in claiming Mr. Hatch for a husband.""",The reporter blushed modestly.,"""I asked her flatly about a drug.",She was quite calm and her manner indicated that she knew nothing of it.,Yet I presume she did.,"Then I sprung the bombshell, and she saw she had made a mistake.",I gave her over to Detective Mallory and she was locked up.,"This done, I wired to the Lincoln Club in Pittsburg to find out about this mysterious 'Harry' who had come into the case.","I was so confident then that I also wired to Mrs. Bell in Butte, presuming that there was a Mrs. Bell, asking about her husband.","""Then Manning came to see me.","I knew he came because he had remembered the name he knew you by,"" and The Thinking Machine turned to the central figure in this strange entanglement of identity, ""although he seemed surprised when I told him as much.",He knew you as Harry Pillsbury.,I asked him who the woman was.,His manner told me that he knew nothing whatever of her.,"Then it came back to her as an associate of Harrison, your enemy for some reason, and I could see it in no other light.","It was her purpose to get hold of you and possibly keep you a prisoner, at least until some gigantic deal in which copper figured was disposed of.",That was what I surmised.,"""Then another telegram came from the Lincoln Club in Pittsburg.","The name of Harry Pillsbury appeared as a visitor in the book in January, three years ago.",It was you--Manning is not the sort of man to be mistaken--and then there remained only one point to be solved as I then saw the case.,"That was an answer from Mrs. Preston Bell, if there was a Mrs. Bell.","She would know where her husband was.""",Again there was silence.,A thousand things were running through Bell's mind.,"The story had been told so pointedly, and was so vitally a part of him, that semi-recollection was again on his face.","""That telegram said that Preston Bell was in Honolulu; that the wife had received a cable dispatch that day.","Then, frankly, I was puzzled; so puzzled, in fact, that the entire fabric I had constructed seemed to melt away before my eyes.",It took me hours to readjust it.,"I tried it all over in detail, and then the theory which would reconcile every fact in the case was evolved.",That theory is right--as right as that two and two make four.,"It's logic.""",It was half an hour later when a detective entered and spoke to Detective Mallory aside.,"""Fine!""",said Mallory.,"""Bring 'em in.""",Then there reappeared the woman who had been a prisoner and a man of fifty years.,"""Harrison!""","exclaimed Bell, suddenly.",He staggered to his feet with outstretched hands.,"""Harrison!",I know!,"I know!""","""Good, good, very good,"" said The Thinking Machine.",Bell's nervously twitching hands were reaching for Harrison's throat when he was pushed aside by Detective Mallory.,"He stood pallid for a moment, then sank down on the floor in a heap.",He was senseless.,The Thinking Machine made a hurried examination.,"""Good!""",he remarked again.,"""When he recovers he will remember everything except what has happened since he has been in Boston.","Meanwhile, Mr. Harrison, we know all about the little affair of the drug, the battle for new copper workings in Honolulu, and your partner there has been arrested.",Your drug didn't do its work well enough.,"Have you anything to add?""",The prisoner was silent.,"""Did you search his rooms?""",asked The Thinking Machine of the detective who had made the double arrest.,"""Yes, and found this.""",It was a large roll of money.,"The Thinking Machine ran over it lightly--$70,000--scanning the numbers of the bills.",At last he held forth half a dozen.,They were among the twenty-seven reported to have been burned in the bank fire in Butte.,Harrison and the woman were led away.,"Subsequently it developed that he had been systematically robbing the bank of which he was president for years; was responsible for the fire, at which time he had evidently expected to make a great haul; and that the woman was not his wife.","Following his arrest this entire story came out; also the facts of the gigantic copper deal, in which he had rid himself of Bell, who was his partner, and had sent another man to Honolulu in Bell's name to buy up options on some valuable copper property there.",This confederate in Honolulu had sent the cable dispatches to the wife in Butte.,She accepted them without question.,It was a day or so later that Hatch dropped in to see The Thinking Machine and asked a few questions.,"""How did Bell happen to have that $10,000?""","""It was given to him, probably, because it was safer to have him rambling about the country, not knowing who he was, than to kill him.""","""And how did he happen to be here?""","""That question may be answered at the trial.""","""And how did it come that Bell was once known as Harry Pillsbury?""","""Bell is a director in United States Steel, I have since learned.",There was a secret meeting of this board in Pittsburg three years ago.,He went incog.,"to attend that meeting and was introduced at the Lincoln Club as Harry Pillsbury.""","""Oh!""",exclaimed Hatch.,THE GREAT AUTO MYSTERY I.,"With a little laugh of sheer light-heartedness on her lips and a twinkle in her blue eyes, Marguerite Melrose bound on a grotesque automobile mask, and stuffed the last strand of her recalcitrant hair beneath her veil.",The pretty face was hidden from mouth to brow; and her curls were ruthlessly imprisoned under a cap held in place by the tightly tied veil.,"""It's perfectly hideous, isn't it?""",she demanded of her companions.,Jack Curtis laughed.,"""Well,"" he remarked, quizzically, ""it's just as well that we _know_ you are pretty.""","""We could never discover it as you are now,"" added Charles Reid.","""Can't see enough of your face to tell whether you are white or black.""","The girl's red lips were pursed into a pout, which ungraciously hid her white teeth, as she considered the matter seriously.","""I think I'll take it off,"" she said at last.","""Don't,"" Curtis warned her.","""On a good road The Green Dragon only hits the tall places.""","""Tear your hair off,"" supplemented Reid.","""When Jack lets her loose it's just a pszzzzt!--and wherever you're going you're there.""","""Not on a night as dark as this?""","protested the girl, quickly.","""I've got lights like twin locomotives,"" Curtis assured her, smilingly.","""It's perfectly safe.","Don't get nervous.""","He tied on his own mask with its bleary goggles, while Reid did the same.","The Green Dragon, a low, gasoline car of racing build, stood panting impatiently, awaiting them at a side door of the hotel.","Curtis assisted Miss Melrose into the front seat and climbed in beside her, while Reid sat behind in the tonneau.","There was a preparatory quiver, the car jerked a little and then began to move.","The three persons in it were Marguerite Melrose, an actress who had attracted attention in the West five years before by her great beauty and had afterwards, by her art, achieved a distinct place; Jack Curtis, a friend since childhood, when both lived in San Francisco and attended the same school, and Charles Reid, his chum, son of a mine owner at Denver.",The unexpected meeting of the three in Boston had been a source of mutual pleasure.,"It had been two years since they had seen one another in Denver, where Miss Melrose was playing.","Now she was in Boston, pursuing certain vocal studies before returning West for her next season.","Reid was in Boston to lay siege to the heart of a young woman of society, Miss Elizabeth Dow, whom he first met in San Francisco.","She was only nineteen years old, but despite this he had begun a siege and his ardor had never cooled, even after Miss Dow returned East.","In Boston, he had heard, she looked with favor upon another man, Morgan Mason, poor but of excellent family, and frantically Reid had rushed, like Lochinvar out of the West, to find the rumor true.",Curtis was one who never had anything to do save seek excitement in a new and novel way.,He had come East with Reid.,They had been together constantly since their arrival in Boston.,"He was of a different type from Reid in that his wealth was distinctly a burden, a thing which left him with nothing to do, and opened illimitable possibilities of dissipation.",The pace he led was one which caused other young men to pause and think.,"Warm-hearted and perfectly at home with both Curtis and Reid, Miss Melrose, the actress, frequently took occasion to scold them.","It was charming to be scolded by Miss Melrose, so much so in fact that it was worth while sinning again.",Since she had appeared on the horizon Curtis had devoted a great deal of time to her; Reid had his own difficulties trying to make Miss Dow change her mind.,"The Green Dragon with its three passengers ran slowly down from the Hotel Yarmouth, where Miss Melrose was stopping, toward the Common, twisting and winding tortuously through the crowd of vehicles.",It was half-past six o'clock in the evening.,"""Cut across here to Commonwealth Avenue,"" Miss Melrose suggested.",She remembered something and her bright blue eyes sparkled beneath the disfiguring mask.,"""I know a delightful old-fashioned inn out this way.",It would be an ideal place to stop for supper.,"I was there once five years ago when I was in Boston.""","""How far?""",asked Reid.,"""Fifteen or twenty miles,"" was the reply.","""Right,"" said Curtis.","""Here we go.""","Soon after they were skimming along Commonwealth Avenue, which at that time of day is practically given over to automobilists, past the Vendome, the Somerset and on over the flat, smooth road.","It was perfectly light now, because the electric lights were about them; but there was no moon above, and once in the country it would be dark going.","Curtis was intent on his machine; Reid was thoughtful for a time, but after awhile leaned over and talked to Miss Melrose.","""I heard something to-day that might interest you,"" he remarked.","""What is it?""",she asked.,"""Don MacLean is in Boston.""","""I heard that,"" she replied, casually.","""Who is he?""",asked Curtis.,"""A man who is frantically in love with Marguerite,"" said Reid, with a smile.","""Charlie!""","the girl reproved, and a flush crept into her face.","""It was never anything very serious.""","Curtis looked at her curiously for a moment, then his eyes turned again to the road ahead.","""I don't suppose it's very serious if a man proposes to a girl seven times, is it?""","Reid asked, banteringly.","""Did he do that?""","asked Curtis, quickly.","""He merely made a fool of himself and me,"" replied the actress, with spirit, speaking to Curtis.","""He was--in love with me, I suppose, but his family objected because I was on the stage and threatened to disinherit him, and all that sort of thing.",So--it ended it.,"Not that I ever considered the matter seriously anyway,"" she added.","There was silence again as The Green Dragon plunged into the darkness of the country, the two brilliant lights ahead showing every dip and rise in the road.",After awhile Curtis spoke again.,"""He's now in Boston?""","""Yes,"" said the girl.","""At least, I've heard so,"" she added, quickly.","Then the conversation ran into other channels, and Curtis, busy with the great machine and the innumerable levers which made it do this or do that or do the other, dropped out of it.","Reid and Miss Melrose talked on, but the whirr of the car as it gained speed made talking unsatisfactory and finally the girl gave herself up to the pure delight of high speed; a dangerous pleasure which sets the nerves atingle and makes one greedy for more.","""Do you smell gasoline?""","Curtis asked suddenly, turning to the others.","""Believe I do,"" said Reid.","""Confound it!","If I've sprung a leak in my tank it will be the deuce,"" Curtis growled amiably.","""Do you think you've got enough to get to the inn?""",asked Miss Melrose.,"""It can't be more than five or six miles now.""","""I'll run on until we stop,"" said Curtis.","""We might be able to stir up some along here somewhere.","I suppose they are prepared for autos.""","At last lights showed ahead, many lights glimmering through the trees.","""I suppose that's the inn now,"" said Curtis.","""Is it?""",he asked of the girl.,"""Really, I don't know, but I have an impression that it isn't.",The one I mean seems farther out than this and it seems to me we passed one on the way.,"However, I don't remember very well.""","""We'll stop and get some gasoline, anyhow,"" said Curtis.",Puffing and snorting odorously The Green Dragon came to a standstill in front of an old house which stood back twenty feet or more from the road.,"It was lighted up, and from inside they could hear the cheery rattle of dishes and see white-aproned waiters moving about.","Above the door was a sign, ""Monarch Inn.""","""Is this the place?""",asked Reid.,"""Oh, no,"" replied Miss Melrose.","""The inn I spoke of was back from the road three or four hundred feet through a grove.""","Curtis leaped out, and evidently dropped something from his pocket as he did so, for he stopped and felt around for a moment.",Then he examined his tank.,"""It's a leak,"" he said, in irritation.","""I haven't more than half a gallon left.",These people must have some gasoline.,"Wait a few minutes.""",Miss Melrose and Reid still sat in the car as he started away toward the house.,"Almost at the veranda he turned and called back: ""Charlie, I dropped something there when I jumped out.",Get down and strike a match and see if you can find it.,"Don't go near that gasoline tank with the match.""",He disappeared inside the house.,Reid climbed out and struck several matches.,Finally he found what was lost and thrust it into an outside pocket.,Miss Melrose was gazing away down the road at two brilliant lights coming toward them rapidly.,"""Rather chilly,"" Reid said, as he straightened up.","""Want a cup of coffee or something?""","""Thanks, no,"" the girl replied.","""I think I'll run in and scare up some sort of a hot drink, if you'll excuse me?""","""Now, Charlie, don't,"" the girl asked, suddenly.","""I don't like it.""","""Oh, one won't hurt,"" he replied, lightly.","""I shan't speak to you when you come out,"" she insisted, half banteringly.","""Oh, yes, you will.""","He laughed, and passed into the house.",Miss Melrose tossed her pretty head impatiently and turned to watch the approaching lights.,"They were blinding as they drew nearer, clearly revealing her figure, in its tan auto coat, to the occupant of the other car.",The newcomer stopped and then she heard whoever was in it--she couldn't see--speaking to her.,"""Would you mind turning your car a little so I can run in off the road?""","""I don't know how,"" she replied, helplessly.",There was a little pause.,"The occupant of the other car was leaning forward, looking at her closely.","""Is that you, Marguerite?""",he asked finally.,"""Yes,"" she replied.","""Who is that?","Don?""","""Yes.""",A man's figure leaped out of the other machine and came toward her.,*     *     *     *     *     * Curtis appeared beside The Green Dragon with a huge can of gasoline twenty minutes later.,"The two occupants of the car were clearly silhouetted against the sky, and Reid, leaning back in the tonneau, was smoking.","""Find it?""",he asked.,"""Yes,"" growled Curtis.",And he began the work of repairing the leak and refilling his tank.,"It took only five minutes or so, and then he climbed up into the car.","""Cold, Marguerite?""",he asked.,"""She won't speak,"" said Reid, leaning forward a little.","""She's angry because I went inside to get a hot Scotch.""","""Wish I had one myself,"" said Curtis.","""Let's wait till we get to the next place,"" Reid interposed.","""A little supper and trimmings will put all of us in a better humor.""","Without answering, Curtis threw a lever, and the car pulled out.",Two automobiles which had been standing when they arrived were still waiting for their owners.,"Annoyed at the delay, Curtis put on full speed.",Finally Reid leaned forward and spoke to the girl.,"""In a good humor?""",he asked.,"She gave no sign of having heard, and Reid placed his hand on her shoulder as he repeated the question.",Still there was no answer.,"""Make her talk to you, Jack,"" he suggested to Curtis.","""What's the matter, Marguerite?""","asked Curtis, as he glanced around.","Still there was no answer, and he slowed up the car a little.",Then he took her arm and shook it gently.,There was no response.,"""What _is_ the matter with her?""",he demanded.,"""Has she fainted?""","Again he shook her, this time more vigorously than before.","""Marguerite,"" he called.","Then his hand sought her face; it was deathly cold, clammy even about the chin.",The upper part was still covered by the mask.,"For the third time he shook her, then, really frightened, apparently, he caught at her gloved wrist and brought the car to a standstill.",There was no trace of a pulse; the wrist was cold as death.,"""She must be ill--very ill,"" he said in some agitation.","""Is there a doctor near here?""","Reid was leaning over the senseless body now, having raised up in the tonneau, and when he spoke there seemed to be fear in his tone.","""Better run on as fast as you can to the inn ahead,"" he instructed Curtis.","""It's nearer than the one we just left.","There may be a doctor there.""",Curtis grabbed frantically at the lever and the car shot ahead suddenly through the dark.,In three minutes the lights of the second inn were in sight.,The two men leaped from the car simultaneously and raced for the house.,"""A doctor, quick,"" Curtis breathlessly demanded of a waiter.","""Next door.""","Without waiting for further instructions, Curtis and Reid ran to the auto, lifted the girl in their arms and took her to a house which stood just a few feet away.","There, after much clamoring, they aroused some one.",Was the doctor in?,Yes.,Would he hurry?,Yes.,The door opened and the men laid the girl's body on a couch in the hall.,Dr. Leonard appeared.,"He was an old fellow, grizzled, with keen, kindly eyes and rigid mouth.","""What's the matter?""",he asked.,"""Think she's dead,"" replied Curtis.",The doctor adjusted his glasses rather hurriedly.,"""Who is she?""","he asked, as he bent over the still figure and fumbled about the throat and breast.","""Miss Marguerite Melrose, an actress,"" explained Curtis, hurriedly.","""What's the matter with her?""","demanded Reid, fiercely.",The doctor still bent over the figure.,"In the dim lamplight Curtis and Reid stood waiting anxiously, impatiently, with white faces.",At last the doctor straightened up.,"""What is it?""",demanded Curtis.,"""She's dead,"" was the reply.","""Great God!""",exclaimed Reid.,"""How?""",Curtis seemed speechless.,"""This,"" said the doctor, and he exhibited a long knife, damp with blood.","""Stabbed through the heart.""","Curtis stared at him, at the knife, then at the inert figure, and lastly at the dead white of her face where it showed beneath the mask.","""Look, Jack!""","exclaimed Reid, suddenly.","""The knife!""","Curtis looked again, then sank down on the couch beside the body.","""Oh, my God!","It's horrible!""",he said.,II.,"To Hutchinson Hatch and half a dozen other reporters, Dr. Leonard, at his home late that night, told the story of the arrival of Jack Curtis and Charles Reid with the body of the girl, and the succeeding events so far as he knew them.","The police and Medical Examiner Francis had preceded the newspaper men, and the body had been removed to a nearby village.","""They came here in great excitement,"" Dr. Leonard explained.","""They brought the body in with them, the man Curtis lifting her by the shoulders and the man Reid at the feet.",They placed the body on this couch.,"I asked them who she was, and they told me she was Marguerite Melrose, an actress.",That's all that was said of her identity.,"""Then I made an examination of the body, seeking a trace of life.","There was none, although the body was not then entirely cold.","In examining her heart my hand struck the knife which had killed her--a heavy weapon, evidently used for rough work, with a blade of six or seven inches.",I drew the knife out.,"Of course, knowing that it had pierced her heart, any idea of doing anything to save her was beyond question.","""One of the men, Curtis, seemed greatly excited about this knife after Reid called his attention to it.","Curtis took the knife out of my hand and examined it closely, then asked if he might keep it.",I told him it would have to be turned over to the medical examiner.,"He argued about it, and finally, to settle the argument, I took it out of his hand.","Reid explained to Curtis that it was necessary for me to keep the knife, and finally Curtis seemed to agree to it.","""Then I suggested that the police be notified.","I did this myself by telephone, the men remaining with me all the time.","I asked if they could throw any light on the tragedy, but neither could.","Curtis said he had been out searching for a man who had the keys to a shed where some gasoline was locked up, and it took fifteen or twenty minutes to find him.",As soon as he got the gasoline he returned to the auto.,"""Reid and Miss Melrose were at this time in the auto, he said.",What had happened while he had been away Curtis didn't know.,"Reid said he, too, had stepped out of the automobile, and after exchanging a few words with Miss Melrose went into the inn.","There he remained fifteen minutes or so, because inside he saw a woman he knew and spoke to her.",He declared that any one of three waiters could verify his statement that he was in the Monarch Inn.,"""After I had notified the police Curtis grew very uneasy in his actions--it didn't occur to me at the moment, but now I recall that it was so--and suggested to Reid that they go on to Boston and send out detectives--special Pinkerton men.","I tried to dissuade them, but they went away.",I couldn't stop them.,"They gave me their cards, however.","They are at the Hotel Teutonic, and told me they could be seen there at any time.",The medical examiner and the police came afterwards.,"I told them, and one of the detectives started immediately for Boston.","They have probably told their story to him by this time.""","""What did the young woman look like?""",asked Hatch.,"""Really, I couldn't say,"" said the doctor.","""She wore an automobile mask which covered all her face except the chin, and there was a veil tied over her cap, concealing her hair.","I didn't remove these; I left the body just as it was for the medical examiner.""","""How was she dressed?""",Hatch went on.,"""She wore a long tan automobile dust coat of what seemed to be rich material, and beneath this a handsome--not a fancy--gown.",I believe it was tailor-made.,"She was a woman of superb figure.""","That was all that could be learned from Dr. Leonard, and Hatch and the other men raced back to Boston.","The next day the newspapers flamed with the mystery of the murder of Miss Melrose, a beautiful Western actress who was visiting Boston.",Each newspaper watched the other greedily to see if there was a picture of Miss Melrose; neither had one.,The newspapers also carried the stories of Jack Curtis and Charles Reid in connection with the murder.,"The stories were in substance just what Dr. Leonard had said, but were given in more detail.","It was the general presumption, almost a foregone conclusion, that some one had killed Miss Melrose while the two men were away from the auto.",Who was this some one?,Man or woman?,No one could answer.,"Reid's story of being inside the Monarch Inn, where he spoke to a lady he knew--but whose name he refused to give--was verified by Hatch's paper.",Three waiters had seen him.,"The medical examiner had made only a brief statement, in which he had said, in answer to a question, that the person who killed Miss Melrose might have been either at her right, in the position Curtis would have occupied while driving the car, or might have leaned forward from behind and stabbed her.","Thus it was not impossible that one of the men in the car with her had killed her, yet against this possibility was the fact that each of the men was one whom one could not readily associate with such a crime.","The fact that the fatal blow was delivered from the right was proven, said the astute medical examiner, by the fact that the knife slanted as a knife could not have been slanted conveniently by a person on her other side--her left.","There were many dark, underlying intimations behind what the medical man said; but he refused to say any more.",Meanwhile the body remained in the village where it had been taken.,Efforts to get a photograph were unavailing; pleas of newspaper artists for permission to sketch her fell upon deaf ears.,"Curtis and Reid, after their first statements, remained in seclusion at the Teutonic.",They were not arrested because this did not seem necessary.,"Both had offered to do anything in their power to solve the riddle, had even employed Pinkerton men who were now on the case; but they would say nothing nor see anyone except the police.","The police encouraged them in this attitude, and hinted darkly and mysteriously at clews which ""would lead to an arrest within twenty-four hours.""",Hatch read these intimations and smiled grimly.,Then he went out to try what a little patience and perseverance and human intelligence would do.,He learned something of Reid's little romance in Boston.,Yet not all of it.,"It was a fact, however, that Reid had called at the home of Miss Elizabeth Dow on Beacon Hill just after noon and inquired for her.","""She is not in,"" the maid had replied.","""I'll leave my card for her,"" said Reid.","""I don't think she'll be back,"" the girl answered.","""Not be back?""",Reid repeated.,"""Why?""","""Haven't you seen the afternoon papers?""",asked the girl.,"""They will explain.","Mrs. Dow, her mother, told me not to talk to anyone.""",Reid left the house with a wrinkle in his brow and walked on toward the Common.,There he halted a newsboy and bought an afternoon paper--many afternoon papers.,"The first pages were loaded with details of the murder of Miss Melrose, theories, conjectures, a thousand little things, with long dispatches of her history and her stage career from San Francisco.",Reid passed these over impatiently with a slight shiver and looked inside the paper.,There he found the thing to which the maid had referred.,"""By George!""",he exclaimed.,"It was a story of the elopement of Elizabeth Dow with Morgan Mason, Reid's rival.",It seemed that Miss Dow and Mason met by appointment at the Monarch Inn and went from there in an automobile.,"The bride had written to her parents before she started, saying she preferred Mason despite his poverty.",The family refused to talk of the matter.,But there in facsimile was the marriage license.,Reid's face was a study as he walked back to the hotel.,"In a private room off the cafÃ© he found Curtis, who had been drinking heavily, yet who, with the strange mood of some men, was not visibly intoxicated.","Reid threw the paper down, open at the elopement announcement.","""See that,"" he said shortly.","Curtis read it--or glanced at it--but did not make a remark until he came to the name, the Monarch Inn.",Then he looked up.,"""That's where the other thing happened, isn't it?""","he asked, rather thickly.","""Yes.""","Curtis rambled off into something else; studiously he avoided any reference to the tragedy, yet that was the one thing which was in his mind.",It was in a futile effort to forget it that he was drinking now.,"He talked on as a drunken man will for a time, then turned suddenly to Reid.","""I loved her,"" he declared suddenly, passionately.","""My God!""","""Try not to think of it,"" Reid advised.","""You'll never say anything about that other thing--the knife--will you?""",pleaded Curtis.,"""Of course not,"" said Reid, impatiently.","""They couldn't drag it out of me.",But you're drinking too much--you want to quit it.,"First thing you know you'll be saying more than--get up and go out and take a walk.""","Curtis stared at Reid vacantly for a moment, as if not understanding, then arose.",He had regained possession of himself to a certain extent.,but his face was pale.,"""I think I will go out,"" he said.","After a time he passed through the cafÃ© door into a side street and, refreshed a little by the cool air, started to walk along Tremont Street toward the shopping district.",It was two o'clock in the afternoon and the streets were thronged.,"Half a dozen reporters were idling in the lobby of the hotel, waiting vainly for either Reid or Curtis.",The newspapers were shouting for another story from the only two men who could know a great deal of the circumstances attending the tragedy.,"Reid, on his return, had marched boldly through the crowd of reporters, paying no attention to their questions.",They had not seen Curtis.,"As Curtis, now free of the reporters, crossed a side street off Tremont on his way toward the shopping district he met Hutchinson Hatch, who was bound for the hotel to see his man there.","Hatch instantly recognized him and fell in behind, curious to see where he would go.","At a favorable opportunity, safe beyond reach of the other men, he intended to ask a few questions.",Curtis turned into Winter Street and strolled along through the crowd of women.,"Half way down Winter Street Hatch followed, and then for a moment he lost sight of him.","He had gone into a store, he imagined.","As he stood at a door waiting, Curtis came out, rushed through the crowd of women, slinging his arms like a madman, with frenzy in his face.","He ran twenty steps, then stumbled and fell.","Hatch immediately ran to his assistance, lifted him up and gazed into the staring, terror-stricken eyes and an ashen face.","""What is it?""","asked Hatch, quickly.","""I--I'm very ill.","I--I think I need a doctor,"" gasped Curtis.","""Take me somewhere, please.""","He fell back limply, half fainting, into Hatch's arms.","A cab came worming through the crowd; Hatch climbed into it, assisting Curtis, and gave some directions to the cabby.","""And hurry,"" he added.","""This gentleman is ill."" The cabby applied the whip and drove out into Tremont, then over toward Park Street.",Curtis aroused a little.,"""Where're we going?""",he demanded.,"""To a doctor,"" replied Hatch.",Curtis sank back with eyes closed and his face white--so white that Hatch felt of the pulse to assure himself that the heart was still beating.,"After a few minutes the cab stopped and, still assisting Curtis, Hatch went to the door.",An aged woman answered the bell.,"""Professor Van Dusen here?""",asked the reporter.,"""Yes.""","""Please tell him that Mr. Hatch is here with a gentleman who needs immediate attention,"" Hatch directed, hurriedly.","He knew his way here and, still supporting Curtis, walked in.",The woman disappeared.,"Curtis sank down on a couch in the little reception room, looked at Hatch glassily for a moment, then without a sound dropped back on the couch unconscious.",After a moment the door opened and there came in Professor Augustus S. F. X.,"Van Dusen, The Thinking Machine.","He squinted inquiringly at Hatch, and Hatch waved his head toward Curtis.","""Dear me, dear me,"" exclaimed The Thinking Machine.","He leaned over the prostrate figure a moment, then disappeared into another room, returning with a hypodermic.",After a few anxious minutes Curtis sat up straight.,"He stared at the two men with unseeing eyes, and in them was unutterable terror.","""_I saw her!","I saw her!_"" he screamed.","""_There was a dagger in her heart.","Marguerite!_"" Again he fell back unconscious.",The Thinking Machine squinted at Hatch.,"""The man's got delirium tremens,"" he snapped impatiently.",III.,For fifteen minutes Hatch silently looked on as The Thinking Machine worked over the unconscious man.,Once or twice Curtis moved uneasily and moaned slightly.,"Hatch had started to explain the situation to The Thinking Machine, but the irascible scientist glared at him and the reporter became silent.",After ten or fifteen minutes The Thinking Machine turned to Hatch more genially.,"""He'll be all right in a little while now,"" he said.","""What is it?""","""Well, it's a murder,"" Hatch began.","""Marguerite Melrose, an actress, was stabbed through the heart last night, and----"" ""Murder?""",interrupted The Thinking Machine.,"""Might it not have been suicide?""","""Might have been; yes,"" said the reporter, after a moment's pause.","""But it appears to be murder.""","""When you say it is murder,"" said The Thinking Machine, ""you immediately give the impression that you were there and saw it.","Go on.""","From the beginning, then, Hatch told the story as he knew it; of the stopping of The Green Dragon at the Monarch Inn, of the events there, of the whereabouts of Curtis and Reid at the time the girl received the knife thrust and of the confirmation of Reid's story.","Then he detailed those incidents of the arrival of the men with the girl at Dr. Leonard's house, of what had transpired there, of the effort Curtis had made to get possession of the knife.","With finger tips pressed together and squinting steadily upward, The Thinking Machine listened.","At its end, which bore on the actions of Curtis just preceding his appearance in the room with them, The Thinking Machine arose and walked over to the couch where Curtis lay.",He ran his slender fingers idly through the unconscious man's thick hair several times.,"""Doesn't it strike you as perfectly possible, Mr. Hatch,"" he asked finally, ""that Miss Melrose _did_ kill herself?""","""It may be perfectly possible, but it doesn't appear so,"" said Hatch.","""There was no motive.""","""And certainly you've shown no motive for anything else,"" said the other, crustily.","""Still,"" he mused, ""I really can't say anything until I talk to him.""","He again turned to his patient, and as he looked saw the red blood surge back into the face.","""Ah, now we're all right,"" he announced.","Thus it happened, for after another ten minutes the patient sat up suddenly on the couch and looked at the two men before him, bewildered.","""What's the matter?""",he asked.,"The thickness was gone from his speech; he was himself again, although a little shaky.","Briefly, Hatch explained to him what had happened, and he listened silently.",Finally he turned to The Thinking Machine.,"""And this gentleman?""",he asked.,"He noted the queer appearance of the scientist, and stared into the squint eyes frankly.","""Professor Van Dusen, a distinguished scientist and physician,"" Hatch introduced.","""I brought you here.","He has been working with you for an hour.""","""And now, Mr. Curtis,"" said The Thinking Machine, ""if you will tell us _all_ you know about the murder of Miss Melrose----"" Curtis paled suddenly.","""Why do you ask me?""",he demanded.,"""You said a great deal while you were unconscious,"" remarked The Thinking Machine, as he dreamily stared at the ceiling.","""I know that worry over that and too much alcohol have put you in a condition bordering on nervous collapse.","I think it would be better if you told it _all_.""","Hatch instantly saw the trend of the scientist's remarks, and remained discreetly silent.","Curtis stared at both for a moment, then paced nervously across the room.","He did not know what he might have said, what chance word might have been dropped.","Then, apparently, he made up his mind, for he stopped suddenly in front of The Thinking Machine.","""Do I look like a man who would commit murder?""",he asked.,"""No, you do not,"" was the prompt response.","His recital of the story was similar to that of Hatch, but the scientist listened carefully.","""Details!","details!""",he interrupted once.,The story was complete from the moment Curtis jumped out of the car until the return to the hotel of Curtis and Reid.,There the narrator stopped.,"""Mr. Curtis, why did you try to induce Dr. Leonard to give up the knife to you?""","asked The Thinking Machine, finally.","""Because--well, because----"" He faltered, flushed and stopped.","""Because you were afraid it would bring the crime home to you?""",asked the scientist.,"""I didn't know _what_ might happen,"" was the response.","""Is it your knife?""",Again the tell-tale flush overspread Curtis's face.,"""No,"" he said, flatly.","""Is it Reid's knife?""","""Oh, no,"" he said, quickly.","""You were in love with Miss Melrose?""","""Yes,"" was the steady reply.","""Had she ever refused to marry you?""","""I had never asked her.""","""Why?""","""Is this a third degree?""","demanded Curtis, angrily, and he arose.","""Am I a prisoner?""","""Not at all,"" said The Thinking Machine, quietly.","""You may be made a prisoner, though, on what you said while unconscious.","I am merely trying to help you.""",Curtis sank down in a chair with his head in his hands and remained motionless for several minutes.,At last he looked up.,"""I'll answer your questions,"" he said.","""Why did you never ask Miss Melrose to marry you?""","""Because--well, because I understood another man, Donald MacLean, was in love with her, and she might have loved him.",I understood she would have married him had it not been that by doing so she would have caused his disinheritance.,"MacLean is now in Boston.""","""Ah!""",exclaimed The Thinking Machine.,"""Your friend Reid didn't happen to be in love with her, too, did he?""","""Oh, no,"" was the reply.","""Reid came here hoping to win the love of Miss Dow, a society girl.","I came with him.""","""Miss Dow?""","asked Hatch, quickly.","""The girl who eloped last night with Morgan Mason?""","""Yes,"" replied Curtis.","""That elopement and this--crime have put Reid almost in as bad a condition as I am.""","""What elopement?""",asked The Thinking Machine.,"Hatch explained how Mason had procured a marriage license, how Miss Dow and Mason had met at the Monarch Inn--where Miss Melrose must have been killed according to all stories--how Miss Dow had written to her parents from there of the elopement and then of their disappearance.","The Thinking Machine listened, but without apparent interest.","""Have you such a knife as was used to kill Miss Melrose?""",he asked at the end.,"""No.""","""Did you ever have such a knife?""","""Well, once.""","""Where did you carry it when it was not in your auto kit?""","""In my lower coat pocket.""","""By the way, what kind of looking woman was Miss Melrose?""","""One of the most beautiful women I ever met,"" said Curtis, with a certain enthusiasm.","""Of ordinary height, superb figure--a woman who would attract attention anywhere.""","""I believe she wore a veil and an automobile mask at the time she was killed?""","""Yes.","They covered all her face except her chin.""","""Could she, wearing an automobile mask, see either side of herself without turning?""","asked The Thinking Machine, pointedly.","""Had you intended to stab her, say while the car was in motion and had the knife in your hand, even in daylight, could she have seen it without turning her head?","Or, if she had had the knife, could you have seen it?""",Curtis shuddered a little.,"""No, I don't believe so.""","""Was she blonde or brunette?""","""Blonde, with great clouds of golden hair,"" said Curtis, and again there was admiration in his tone.","""Golden hair?""",Hatch repeated.,"""I understood Medical Examiner Francis to say she had dark hair?""","""No, golden hair,"" was the positive reply.","""Did you see the body, Mr.","Hatch?""",asked the scientist.,"""No.",None of us saw it.,"Dr. Francis makes that a rule.""","The Thinking Machine arose, excused himself and passed into another room.",They heard the telephone bell ring and then some one closed the door connecting the two rooms.,When the scientist returned he went straight to a point which Hatch had impatiently awaited.,"""What happened to you this afternoon in Winter Street?""",Curtis had retained his composure well up to this point; now he became uneasy again.,Quick pallor on his face was succeeded by a flush which crept up to the roots of his hair.,"""I've been drinking too much,"" he said at last.","""That and this thing have completely unnerved me.","I am afraid I was not myself.""","""What did you _think_ you saw?""",insisted The Thinking Machine.,"""I went into a store for something.",I've forgotten what now.,I know there was a great crowd of women--they were all about me.,"There I saw--"" He stopped and was silent for a moment.","""There I saw,"" he went on with an effort, ""a woman--just a glimpse of her, over the heads of the others in the store--and----"" ""And what?""",insisted The Thinking Machine.,"""At the moment I would have sworn it was Marguerite Melrose,"" was the reply.","""Of course you know you were mistaken?""","""I know it now,"" said Curtis.","""It was a chance resemblance, but the effect on me was awful.",I ran out of there shrieking--it seemed to me.,"Then I found myself here.""","""And you don't know what you said or did from that time until the present?""","asked the scientist, curiously.","""No, except in a hazy sort of way.""","After awhile Martha, the scientist's aged servant, appeared in the doorway.","""Mr. Mallory and a gentleman, sir.""","""Let them come in,"" said The Thinking Machine.","""Mr. Curtis,"" and he turned to him gravely, ""Mr. Reid is here.",I sent for him as if at your request to ask him two questions.,"If he answers those questions, as I believe he will, I can demonstrate that you are not guilty of and have no connection with the murder of Miss Melrose.","Let me ask these questions, without any hint or remark from you as to what the answer must be.","Are you willing?""","""I am,"" replied Curtis.","His face was white, but his voice was firm.","Detective Mallory, whom Curtis didn't know, and Charles Reid entered the room.",Both looked about curiously.,Mallory nodded brusquely at Hatch.,Reid looked at Curtis and Curtis looked away.,"""Mr. Reid,"" said The Thinking Machine, without any preliminary, ""Mr. Curtis tells me that the knife used to kill Miss Melrose was your property.","Is that so?""","he demanded quickly, as Curtis faced about wonderingly.","""No,"" thundered Reid, fiercely.","""Is it Mr. Curtis's knife?""",asked The Thinking Machine.,"""Yes,"" flashed Reid.","""It's a part of his auto kit.""",Curtis started to speak; The Thinking Machine waved his hand toward him.,Detective Mallory caught the gesture and understood that Jack Curtis was his prisoner for murder.,IV.,Curtis was led away and locked up.,"He raved and bitterly denounced Reid for the information he had given, but he did not deny it.","Indeed, after the first burst of fury he said nothing.","Once he was under lock and key the police, led by Detective Mallory, searched his rooms at the Hotel Teutonic and there they found a handkerchief stained with blood.","It was slight, still it was a stain.","This was immediately placed in the hands of an expert, who pronounced it human blood.","Then the case against Curtis seemed complete; it was his knife, he had been in love with Miss Melrose, therefore probably jealous of her, and here was the tell-tale bloodstain.",Meanwhile Reid was permitted to go his way.,"He seemed crushed by the rapid sequence of events, and read eagerly every line he could find in the public prints concerning both the murder and the elopement of Miss Dow.","This latter affair, indeed, seemed to have greater sway over his mind than the murder, or that a lifetime friend was now held as the murderer.",Meanwhile The Thinking Machine had signified to Hatch his desire to visit the scene of the crime and see what might be done there.,"Late in the afternoon, therefore, they started, taking a train for a village nearest the Monarch Inn.","""It's a most extraordinary case,"" The Thinking Machine said, ""much more extraordinary than you can imagine.""","""In what respect?""",asked the reporter.,"""In motive, in the actual manner of the girl meeting her death and in a dozen other details which I can't state now because I haven't all the facts.""","""You don't doubt but what it was murder?""","""It doesn't necessarily follow,"" said The Thinking Machine, evasively.","""Suppose we were seeking a motive for Miss Melrose's suicide, what would we have?",We would have her love affair with this man MacLean whom she refused to marry because she knew he would be disinherited.,"Suppose she had not seen him for a couple of years--suppose she had made up her mind to give him up--that he had suddenly appeared when she sat alone in the automobile in front of the Monarch Inn--suppose, then, finding all her love reawakened, she had decided to end it all?""","""But Curtis's knife and the blood on his handkerchief?""","""Suppose, having made up her mind to kill herself, she had sought a weapon?""","went on The Thinking Machine, as if there had been no interruption.","""What is more natural than she should have sought something--the knife, say--in the tool bag or kit, which must have been near her?","Suppose she stabbed herself while the men were away from the automobile, or even after they had started on again in the darkness?""",Hatch looked a little crestfallen.,"""You believe, then, that she did kill herself?""",he asked.,"""Certainly not,"" was the prompt response.","""I don't believe Miss Melrose killed herself--but as yet I know nothing to the contrary.","As for the blood on Curtis's handkerchief, remember he helped carry the body to Dr. Leonard; it might have come from that--it might have come from a slight spattering of blood.""","""But circumstances certainly implicate Curtis.""","""I wouldn't convict any man of any crime on any circumstantial evidence,"" was the response.","""It's worthless unless a man is forced to confess.""","The reporter was puzzled, bewildered, and his face showed it.","There were many things he did not understand, but the principal question in his mind took form: ""Why did you turn Curtis over to the police, then?""","""Because he is the man who owned the knife,"" was the reply.","""I knew he was lying to me from the first about the knife.","Men have been executed on less evidence than that.""","The train stopped and they proceeded to the office of the medical examiner, where the body of the woman lay.","Professor Van Dusen was readily permitted to see the body, even to offer his expert assistance in an autopsy which was then being performed; but the reporter was stopped at the door.",After an hour The Thinking Machine came out.,"""She was stabbed from the right,"" he said in answer to Hatch's inquiring look, ""either by some one sitting at her right, by some one leaning over her right shoulder, or she might have done it herself.""","Then they went on to Monarch Inn, five miles away.","Here, after a comprehensive squint at the landscape, The Thinking Machine entered and for half an hour questioned three waiters there.",Did these waiters see Mr. Reid?,Yes.,They identified his published picture as a gentleman who had come in and taken a hot Scotch at the bar.,Any one with him?,No.,Speak to anyone in the inn?,"Yes, a lady.","""What did she look like?""",asked The Thinking Machine.,"""Couldn't say, sir,"" the waiter replied.","""She came in an automobile and wore a mask, with a veil tied about her head and a long tan automobile coat.""","""With the mask on you couldn't see her face?""","""Only her chin, sir.""","""No glimpse of her hair?""","""No, sir.","It was covered by the veil.""",Then The Thinking Machine turned loose a flood of questions.,"He learned that the woman had been waiting at the inn for nearly an hour when Reid entered; that she had come there alone and at her request had been shown into a private parlor--""to wait for a gentleman,"" she had told the waiter.","She had opened the door when she heard Reid enter and had glanced out, but he had disappeared into the bar before she saw him.",When he started away she looked out again.,Then she saw him and he saw her.,"She seemed surprised and started to close the door, when he spoke to her.","No one heard what was said, but he went in and the door was closed.",No one knew just when either Reid or the woman left the inn.,Some half an hour or so after Reid entered the room a waiter rapped on the door.,There was no answer.,"He opened the door and went in, but there was no one there.",It was presumed then that the gentleman she had been waiting for had appeared and they had gone out together.,"It was a fact that an automobile had come up meanwhile--in addition to that in which Curtis, Miss Melrose and Reid had come--and had gone away again.","When all this questioning had come to an end and these facts were in possession of The Thinking Machine, the reporter advanced a theory.","""That woman was unquestionably Miss Dow, who knew Reid and who eloped that night with Morgan Mason.""","The Thinking Machine looked at him a moment without speaking, then led the way into the private room where the lady had been waiting.",Hatch followed.,"They remained there five or ten minutes, then The Thinking Machine came out and started toward the front door, only eight or ten feet from this room.",The road was twenty feet away.,"""Let's go,"" he said, finally.","""Where?""",asked Hatch.,"""Don't you see?""","asked The Thinking Machine, irrelevantly, ""that it would have been perfectly possible for Miss Melrose herself to have left the automobile and gone inside the inn for a few minutes?""",Following previously received directions The Thinking Machine now set out to find the man who had charge of the gasoline tank.,They went away together and remained half an hour.,On the scientist's return to where Hatch had been waiting impatiently they climbed into the car which had brought them to the inn.,"""Two miles

little.","""I never happened to meet one.""","""Well, this looks like a good story,"" the City Editor explained.","""It's a haunted house.","Nobody can live in it; all sorts of strange happenings,

attracted to the latest creepy mystery of a small town by the sea which in the past had not been wholly lacking in creepy mysteries.,Within two hours Hatch was there.,"He readily found the old Weston house, as it was known, a two-story, solidly built frame structure, which had stood for sixty or seventy years high upon a cliff overlooking the sea, in the center of a land plot of ten or twelve acres.","From a distance it was imposing, but close inspection showed that, outwardly, at least, it was a ramshackle affair.","Without having questioned anyone in the village, Hatch climbed the steep cliff road to the old house, expecting to find some one who might grant him permission to inspect it.",But no one appeared; a settled melancholy and gloom seemed to overspread it; all the shutters were closed forbiddingly.,"There was no answer to his vigorous knock on the front door, and he shook the shutters on a window without result.",Then he passed around the house to the back.,Here he found a door and dutifully hammered on it.,Still no answer.,"He tried it, and passed in.","He stood in the kitchen, damp, chilly and darkened by the closed shutters.","One glance about this room and he went on through a back hall to the dining-room, now deserted, but at one time a comfortable and handsomely furnished place.",Its hardwood floor was covered with dust; the chill of disuse was all-pervading.,"There was no furniture, only the litter which accumulates of its own accord.","From this point, just inside the dining-room door, Hatch began a sort of study of the inside architecture of the place.","To his left was a door, the butler's pantry.","There was a passage through, down three steps into the kitchen he had just left.","Straight before him, set in the wall, between two windows, was a large mirror, seven, possibly eight, feet tall and proportionately wide.",A mirror of the same size was set in the wall at the end of the room to his left.,From the dining-room he passed through a wide archway into the next room.,This archway made the two rooms almost as one.,"This second, he presumed, had been a sort of living-room, but here, too, was nothing save accumulated litter, an old-fashioned fireplace and two long mirrors.","As he entered, the fireplace was to his immediate left, one of the large mirrors was straight ahead of him and the other was to his right.",Next to the mirror in the end was a passageway of a little more than usual size which had once been closed with a sliding door.,Hatch went through this into the reception-hall of the old house.,"Here, to his right, was the main hall, connected with the reception-hall by an archway, and through this archway he could see a wide, old-fashioned stairway leading up.","To his left was a door, of ordinary size, closed.",He tried it and it opened.,He peered into a big room beyond.,This room had been the library.,It smelled of books and damp wood.,There was nothing here--not even mirrors.,"Beyond the main hall lay only two rooms, one a drawing-room of the generous proportions our old folks loved, with its gilt all tarnished and its fancy decorations covered with dust.","Behind this, toward the back of the house, was a small parlor.","There was nothing here to attract his attention, and he went upstairs.","As he went he could see through the archway into the reception-hall as far as the library door, which he had left closed.",Upstairs were four or five roomy suites.,"Here, too, in small rooms designed for dressing, he saw the owner's passion for mirrors again.","As he passed through room after room he fixed the general arrangement of it all in his mind, and later on paper, to study it, so that, if necessary, he could leave any part of the house in the dark.","He didn't know but what this might be necessary, hence his care--the same care he had evidenced downstairs.","After another casual examination of the lower floor, Hatch went out the back way to the barn.",This stood a couple of hundred feet back of the house and was of more recent construction.,"Above, reached by outside stairs, were apartments intended for the servants.","Hatch looked over these rooms, but they, too, had the appearance of not having been occupied for several years.","The lower part of the barn, he found, was arranged to house half a dozen horses and three or four traps.","""Nothing here to frighten anybody,"" was his mental comment as he left the old place and started back toward the village.",It was three o'clock in the afternoon.,"His purpose was to learn then all he could of the ""ghost,"" and return that night for developments.","He sought out the usual village bureau of information, the town constable, a grizzled old chap of sixty years, who realized his importance as the whole police department, and who had the gossip and information, more or less distorted, of several generations at his tongue's end.",The old man talked for two hours--he was glad to talk--seemed to have been longing for just such a glorious opportunity as the reporter offered.,"Hatch sifted out what he wanted, those things which might be valuable in his story.","It seemed, according to the constable, that the Weston house had not been occupied for five years, since the death of the father of Ernest Weston, present owner.",Two weeks before the reporter's appearance there Ernest Weston had come down with a contractor and looked over the old place.,"""We understand here,"" said the constable, judicially, ""that Mr. Weston is going to be married soon, and we kind of thought he was having the house made ready for his Summer home again.""","""Whom do you understand he is to marry?""","asked Hatch, for this was news.","""Miss Katherine Everard, daughter of Curtis Everard, a banker up in Boston,"" was the reply.","""I know he used to go around with her before the old man died, and they say since she came out in Newport he has spent a lot of time with her.""","""Oh, I see,"" said Hatch.","""They were to marry and come here?""","""That's right,"" said the constable.","""But I don't know when, since this ghost story has come up.""","""Oh, yes, the ghost,"" remarked Hatch.","""Well, hasn't the work of repairing begun?""","""No, not inside,"" was the reply.","""There's been some work done on the grounds--in the daytime--but not much of that, and I kind of think it will be a long time before it's all done.""","""What is the spook story, anyway?""","""Well,"" and the old constable rubbed his chin thoughtfully.","""It seems sort of funny.","A few days after Mr. Weston was down here a gang of laborers, mostly Italians, came down to work and decided to sleep in the house--sort of camp out--until they could repair a leak in the barn and move in there.","They got here late in the afternoon and didn't do much that day but move into the house, all upstairs, and sort of settle down for the night.","About one o'clock they heard some sort of noise downstairs, and finally all sorts of a racket and groans and yells, and they just naturally came down to see what it was.","""Then they saw the ghost.","It was in the reception-hall, some of 'em said, others said it was in the library, but anyhow it was there, and the whole gang left just as fast as they knew how.",They slept on the ground that night.,Next day they took out their things and went back to Boston.,"Since then nobody here has heard from 'em.""","""What sort of a ghost was it?""","""Oh, it was a man ghost, about nine feet high, and he was blazing from head to foot as if he was burning up,"" said the constable.","""He had a long knife in his hand and waved it at 'em.",They didn't stop to argue.,"They ran, and as they ran they heard the ghost a-laughing at them.""","""I should think he would have been amused,"" was Hatch's somewhat sarcastic comment.","""Has anybody who lives in the village seen the ghost?""","""No; we're willing to take their word for it, I suppose,"" was the grinning reply, ""because there never was a ghost there before.","I go up and look over the place every afternoon, but everything seems to be all right, and I haven't gone there at night.","It's quite a way off my beat,"" he hastened to explain.","""A man ghost with a long knife,"" mused Hatch.","""Blazing, seems to be burning up, eh?",That sounds exciting.,"Now, a ghost who knows his business never appears except where there has been a murder.","Was there ever a murder in that house?""","""When I was a little chap I heard there was a murder or something there, but I suppose if I don't remember it nobody else here does,"" was the old man's reply.","""It happened one Winter when the Westons weren't there.","There was something, too, about jewelry and diamonds, but I don't remember just what it was.""","""Indeed?""",asked the reporter.,"""Yes, something about somebody trying to steal a lot of jewelry--a hundred thousand dollars' worth.",I know nobody ever paid much attention to it.,"I just heard about it when I was a boy, and that was at least fifty years ago.""","""I see,"" said the reporter.","*     *     *     *     *     * That night at nine o'clock, under cover of perfect blackness, Hatch climbed the cliff toward the Weston house.","At one o'clock he came racing down the hill, with frequent glances over his shoulder.",His face was pallid with a fear which he had never known before and his lips were ashen.,"Once in his room in the village hotel Hutchinson Hatch, the nerveless young man, lighted a lamp with trembling hands and sat with wide, staring eyes until the dawn broke through the east.",He had seen the flaming phantom.,II.,It was ten o'clock that morning when Hutchinson Hatch called on Professor Augustus S. F. X.,Van Dusen--The Thinking Machine.,"The reporter's face was still white, showing that he had slept little, if at all.","The Thinking Machine squinted at him a moment through his thick glasses, then dropped into a chair.","""Well?""",he queried.,"""I'm almost ashamed to come to you, Professor,"" Hatch confessed, after a minute, and there was a little embarrassed hesitation in his speech.","""It's another mystery.""","""Sit down and tell me about it.""",Hatch took a seat opposite the scientist.,"""I've been frightened,"" he said at last, with a sheepish grin; ""horribly, awfully frightened.","I came to you to know what frightened me.""","""Dear me!","Dear me!""",exclaimed The Thinking Machine.,"""What is it?""","Then Hatch told him from the beginning the story of the haunted house as he knew it; how he had examined the house by daylight, just what he had found, the story of the old murder and the jewels, the fact that Ernest Weston was to be married.",The scientist listened attentively.,"""It was nine o'clock that night when I went to the house the second time,"" said Hatch.","""I went prepared for something, but not for what I saw.""","""Well, go on,"" said the other, irritably.","""I went in while it was perfectly dark.","I took a position on the stairs because I had been told the--the THING--had been seen from the stairs, and I thought that where it had been seen once it would be seen again.","I had presumed it was some trick of a shadow, or moonlight, or something of the kind.",So I sat waiting calmly.,"I am not a nervous man--that is, I never have been until now.","""I took no light of any kind with me.","It seemed an interminable time that I waited, staring into the reception-room in the general direction of the library.","At last, as I gazed into the darkness, I heard a noise.","It startled me a bit, but it didn't frighten me, for I put it down to a rat running across the floor.","""But after awhile I heard the most awful cry a human being ever listened to.",It was neither a moan nor a shriek--merely a--a cry.,"Then, as I steadied my nerves a little, a figure--a blazing, burning white figure--grew out of nothingness before my very eyes, in the reception-room.","It actually grew and assembled as I looked at it.""","He paused, and The Thinking Machine changed his position slightly.","""The figure was that of a man, apparently, I should say, eight feet high.",Don't think I'm a fool--I'm not exaggerating.,"It was all in white and seemed to radiate a light, a ghostly, unearthly light, which, as I looked, grew brighter.","I saw no face to the THING, but it had a head.","Then I saw an arm raised and in the hand was a dagger, blazing as was the figure.","""By this time I was a coward, a cringing, frightened coward--frightened not at what I saw, but at the weirdness of it.","And then, still as I looked, the--the THING--raised the other hand, and there, in the air before my eyes, wrote with his own finger--_on the very face of the air_, mind you--one word: 'Beware!'""","""Was it a man's or woman's writing?""",asked The Thinking Machine.,"The matter-of-fact tone recalled Hatch, who was again being carried away by fear, and he laughed vacantly.","""I don't know,"" he said.","""I don't know.""","""Go on.""","""I have never considered myself a coward, and certainly I am not a child to be frightened at a thing which my reason tells me is not possible, and, despite my fright, I compelled myself to action.","If the THING were a man I was not afraid of it, dagger and all; if it were not, it could do me no injury.","""I leaped down the three steps to the bottom of the stairs, and while the THING stood there with upraised dagger, with one hand pointing at me, I rushed for it.","I think I must have shouted, because I have a dim idea that I heard my own voice.","But whether or not I did I----"" Again he paused.",It was a distinct effort to pull himself together.,"He felt like a child; the cold, squint eyes of The Thinking Machine were turned on him disapprovingly.","""Then--the THING disappeared just as it seemed I had my hands on it.",I was expecting a dagger thrust.,"Before my eyes, while I was staring at it, I suddenly saw _only half of it_.","Again I heard the cry, and the other half disappeared--my hands grasped empty air.","""Where the THING had been there was nothing.","The impetus of my rush was such that I went right on past the spot where the THING had been, and found myself groping in the dark in a room which I didn't place for an instant.",Now I know it was the library.,"""By this time I was mad with terror.",I smashed one of the windows and went through it.,"Then from there, until I reached my room, I didn't stop running.",I couldn't.,"I wouldn't have gone back to the reception-room for all the millions in the world.""","The Thinking Machine twiddled his fingers idly; Hatch sat gazing at him with anxious, eager inquiry in his eyes.","""So when you ran and the--the THING moved away or disappeared you found yourself in the library?""",The Thinking Machine asked at last.,"""Yes.""","""Therefore you must have run from the reception-room through the door into the library?""","""Yes.""","""You left that door closed that day?""","""Yes.""",Again there was a pause.,"""Smell anything?""",asked The Thinking Machine.,"""No.""","""You figure that the THING, as you call it, must have been just about in the door?""","""Yes.""","""Too bad you didn't notice the handwriting--that is, whether it seemed to be a man's or a woman's.""","""I think, under the circumstances, I would be excused for omitting that,"" was the reply.","""You said you heard something that you thought must be a rat,"" went on The Thinking Machine.","""What was this?""","""I don't know.""","""Any squeak about it?""","""No, not that I noticed.""","""Five years since the house was occupied,"" mused the scientist.","""How far away is the water?""","""The place overlooks the water, but it's a steep climb of three hundred yards from the water to the house.""",That seemed to satisfy The Thinking Machine as to what actually happened.,"""When you went over the house in daylight, did you notice if any of the mirrors were dusty?""",he asked.,"""I should presume that all were,"" was the reply.","""There's no reason why they should have been otherwise.""","""But you didn't notice particularly that some were not dusty?""",the scientist insisted.,"""No.","I merely noticed that they were there.""","The Thinking Machine sat for a long time squinting at the ceiling, then asked, abruptly: ""Have you seen Mr. Weston, the owner?""","""No.""","""See him and find out what he has to say about the place, the murder, the jewels, and all that.","It would be rather a queer state of affairs if, say, a fortune in jewels should be concealed somewhere about the place, wouldn't it?""","""It would,"" said Hatch.","""It would.""","""Who is Miss Katherine Everard?""","""Daughter of a banker here, Curtis Everard.",Was a reigning belle at Newport for two seasons.,"She is now in Europe, I think, buying a trousseau, possibly.""","""Find out all about her, and what Weston has to say, then come back here,"" said The Thinking Machine, as if in conclusion.","""Oh, by the way,"" he added, ""look up something of the family history of the Westons.",How many heirs were there?,Who are they?,How much did each one get?,All those things.,"That's all.""","Hatch went out, far more composed and quiet than when he entered, and began the work of finding out those things The Thinking Machine had asked for, confident now that there would be a solution of the mystery.",That night the flaming phantom played new pranks.,"The town constable, backed by half a dozen villagers, descended upon the place at midnight, to be met in the yard by the apparition in person.",Again the dagger was seen; again the ghostly laughter and the awful cry were heard.,"""Surrender or I'll shoot,"" shouted the constable, nervously.","A laugh was the answer, and the constable felt something warm spatter in his face.","Others in the party felt it, too, and wiped their faces and hands.",By the light of the feeble lanterns they carried they examined their handkerchiefs and hands.,Then the party fled in awful disorder.,"The warmth they had felt was the warmth of blood--red blood, freshly drawn.",III.,Hatch found Ernest Weston at luncheon with another gentleman at one o'clock that day.,"This other gentleman was introduced to Hatch as George Weston, a cousin.",Hatch instantly remembered George Weston for certain eccentric exploits at Newport a season or so before; and also as one of the heirs of the original Weston estate.,"Hatch thought he remembered, too, that at the time Miss Everard had been so prominent socially at Newport George Weston had been her most ardent suitor.","It was rumored that there would have been an engagement between them, but her father objected.","Hatch looked at him curiously; his face was clearly a dissipated one, yet there was about him the unmistakable polish and gentility of the well-bred man of society.","Hatch knew Ernest Weston as Weston knew Hatch; they had met frequently in the ten years Hatch had been a newspaper reporter, and Weston had been courteous to him always.","The reporter was in doubt as to whether to bring up the subject on which he had sought out Ernest Weston, but the broker brought it up himself, smilingly.","""Well, what is it this time?""","he asked, genially.","""The ghost down on the South Shore, or my forthcoming marriage?""","""Both,"" replied Hatch.","Weston talked freely of his engagement to Miss Everard, which he said was to have been announced in another week, at which time she was due to return to America from Europe.","The marriage was to be three or four months later, the exact date had not been set.","""And I suppose the country place was being put in order as a Summer residence?""",the reporter asked.,"""Yes.","I had intended to make some repairs and changes there, and furnish it, but now I understand that a ghost has taken a hand in the matter and has delayed it.","Have you heard much about this ghost story?""","he asked, and there was a slight smile on his face.","""I have seen the ghost,"" Hatch answered.","""You have?""",demanded the broker.,"George Weston echoed the words and leaned forward, with a new interest in his eyes, to listen.",Hatch told them what had happened in the haunted house--all of it.,"They listened with the keenest interest, one as eager as the other.","""By George!""","exclaimed the broker, when Hatch had finished.","""How do you account for it?""","""I don't,"" said Hatch, flatly.","""I can offer no possible solution.","I am not a child to be tricked by the ordinary illusion, nor am I of the temperament which imagines things, but I can offer no explanation of this.""","""It must be a trick of some sort,"" said George Weston.","""I was positive of that,"" said Hatch, ""but if it is a trick, it is the cleverest I ever saw.""",The conversation drifted on to the old story of missing jewels and a tragedy in the house fifty years before.,"Now Hatch was asking questions by direction of The Thinking Machine; he himself hardly saw their purport, but he asked them.","""Well, the full story of that affair, the tragedy there, would open up an old chapter in our family which is nothing to be ashamed of, of course,"" said the broker, frankly; ""still it is something we have not paid much attention to for many years.",Perhaps George here knows it better than I do.,"His mother, then a bride, heard the recital of the story from my grandmother.""","Ernest Weston and Hatch looked inquiringly at George Weston, who lighted a fresh cigarette and leaned over the table toward them.",He was an excellent talker.,"""I've heard my mother tell of it, but it was a long time ago,"" he began.","""It seems, though, as I remember it, that my great-grandfather, who built the house, was a wealthy man, as fortunes went in those days, worth probably a million dollars.","""A part of this fortune, say about one hundred thousand dollars, was in jewels, which had come with the family from England.","Many of those pieces would be of far greater value now than they were then, because of their antiquity.","It was only on state occasions, I might say, when these were worn, say, once a year.","""Between times the problem of keeping them safely was a difficult one, it appeared.",This was before the time of safety deposit vaults.,"My grandfather conceived the idea of hiding the jewels in the old place down on the South Shore, instead of keeping them in the house he had in Boston.",He took them there accordingly.,"""At this time one was compelled to travel down the South Shore, below Cohasset anyway, by stagecoach.","My grandfather's family was then in the city, as it was Winter, so he made the trip alone.","He planned to reach there at night, so as not to attract attention to himself, to hide the jewels about the house, and leave that same night for Boston again by a relay of horses he had arranged for.","Just what happened after he left the stagecoach, below Cohasset, no one ever knew except by surmise.""",The speaker paused a moment and relighted his cigarette.,"""Next morning my great-grandfather was found unconscious and badly injured on the veranda of the house.",His skull had been fractured.,In the house a man was found dead.,No one knew who he was; no one within a radius of many miles of the place had ever seen him.,"""This led to all sorts of surmises, the most reasonable of which, and the one which the family has always accepted, being that my grandfather had gone to the house in the dark, had there met some one who was stopping there that night as a shelter from the intense cold, that this man learned of the jewels, that he had tried robbery and there was a fight.","""In this fight the stranger was killed inside the house, and my great-grandfather, injured, had tried to leave the house for aid.",He collapsed on the veranda where he was found and died without having regained consciousness.,"That's all we know or can surmise reasonably about the matter.""","""Were the jewels ever found?""",asked the reporter.,"""No.","They were not on the dead man, nor were they in the possession of my grandfather.""","""It is reasonable to suppose, then, that there was a third man and that he got away with the jewels?""",asked Ernest Weston.,"""It seemed so, and for a long time this theory was accepted.","I suppose it is now, but some doubt was cast on it by the fact that only two trails-of footsteps led to the house and none out.",There was a heavy snow on the ground.,"If none led out it was obviously impossible that anyone came out.""",Again there was silence.,Ernest Weston sipped his coffee slowly.,"""It would seem from that,"" said Ernest Weston, at last, ""that the jewels were hidden before the tragedy, and have never been found.""",George Weston smiled.,"""Off and on for twenty years the place was searched, according to my mother's story,"" he said.","""Every inch of the cellar was dug up; every possible nook and corner was searched.","Finally the entire matter passed out of the minds of those who knew of it, and I doubt if it has ever been referred to again until now.""","""A search even now would be almost worth while, wouldn't it?""",asked the broker.,George Weston laughed aloud.,"""It might be,"" he said, ""but I have some doubt.","A thing that was searched for for twenty years would not be easily found.""",So it seemed to strike the others after awhile and the matter was dropped.,"""But this ghost thing,"" said the broker, at last.","""I'm interested in that.",Suppose we make up a ghost party and go down to-night.,"My contractor declares he can't get men to work there.""","""I would be glad to go,"" said George Weston, ""but I'm running over to the Vandergrift ball in Providence to-night.""","""How about you, Hatch?""",asked the broker.,"""I'll go, yes,"" said Hatch, ""as one of several,"" he added with a smile.","""Well, then, suppose we say the constable and you and I?""","asked the broker; ""to-night?""","""All right.""",After making arrangements to meet the broker later that afternoon he rushed away--away to The Thinking Machine.,"The scientist listened, then resumed some chemical test he was making.","""Can't you go down with us to-night?""",Hatch asked.,"""No,"" said the other.","""I'm going to read a paper before a scientific society and prove that a chemist in Chicago is a fool.","That will take me all evening.""","""To-morrow night?""",Hatch insisted.,"""No--the next night.""",This would be on Friday night--just in time for the feature which had been planned for Sunday.,"Hatch was compelled to rest content with this, but he foresaw that he would have it all, with a solution.","It never occurred to him that this problem, or, indeed, that any problem, was beyond the mental capacity of Professor Van Dusen.","Hatch and Ernest Weston took a night train that evening, and on their arrival in the village stirred up the town constable.","""Will you go with us?""",was the question.,"""Both of you going?""",was the counter-question.,"""Yes.""","""I'll go,"" said the constable promptly.","""Ghost!""",and he laughed scornfully.,"""I'll have him in the lockup by morning.""","""No shooting, now,"" warned Weston.","""There must be somebody back of this somewhere; we understand that, but there is no crime that we know of.","The worst is possibly trespassing.""","""I'll get him all right,"" responded the constable, who still remembered the experience where blood--warm blood--had been thrown in his face.","""And I'm not so sure there isn't a crime.""","That night about ten the three men went into the dark, forbidding house and took a station on the stairs where Hatch had sat when he saw the THING--whatever it was.",There they waited.,"The constable moved nervously from time to time, but neither of the others paid any attention to him.",At last the--the THING appeared.,"There had been a preliminary sound as of something running across the floor, then suddenly a flaming figure of white seemed to grow into being in the reception-room.",It was exactly as Hatch had described it to The Thinking Machine.,"Dazed, stupefied, the three men looked, looked as the figure raised a hand, pointing toward them, and wrote a word in the air--positively in the air.","The finger merely waved, and there, floating before them were letters, flaming letters, in the utter darkness.","This time the word was: ""Death.""","Faintly, Hatch, fighting with a fear which again seized him, remembered that The Thinking Machine had asked him if the handwriting was that of a man or woman; now he tried to see.","It was as if drawn on a blackboard, and there was a queer twist to the loop at the bottom.",He sniffed to see if there was an odor of any sort.,There was not.,"Suddenly he felt some quick, vigorous action from the constable behind him.",There was a roar and a flash in his ear; he knew the constable had fired at the THING.,Then came the cry and laugh--almost a laugh of derision--he had heard them before.,"For one instant the figure lingered and then, before their eyes, faded again into utter blackness.",Where it had been was nothing--nothing.,_The constable's shot had had no effect_.,IV.,Three deeply mystified men passed down the hill to the village from the old house.,"Ernest Weston, the owner, had not spoken since before the--the THING appeared there in the reception-room, or was it in the library?",He was not certain--he couldn't have told.,Suddenly he turned to the constable.,"""I told you not to shoot.""","""That's all right,"" said the constable.","""I was there in my official capacity, and I shoot when I want to.""","""But the shot did no harm,"" Hatch put in.","""I would swear it went right through it, too,"" said the constable, boastfully.","""I can shoot.""",Weston was arguing with himself.,He was a cold-blooded man of business; his mind was not one to play him tricks.,Yet now he felt benumbed; he could conceive no explanation of what he had seen.,"Again in his room in the little hotel, where they spent the remainder of the night, he stared blankly at the reporter.","""Can you imagine any way it could be done?""",Hatch shook his head.,"""It isn't a spook, of course,"" the broker went on, with a nervous smile; ""but--but I'm sorry I went.","I don't think probably I shall have the work done there as I thought.""",They slept only fitfully and took an early train back to Boston.,"As they were about to separate at the South Station, the broker had a last word.","""I'm going to solve that thing,"" he declared, determinedly.","""I know one man at least who isn't afraid of it--or of anything else.",I'm going to send him down to keep a lookout and take care of the place.,"His name is O'Heagan, and he's a fighting Irishman.","If he and that--that--THING ever get mixed up together----"" Like a schoolboy with a hopeless problem, Hatch went straight to The Thinking Machine with the latest developments.",The scientist paused just long enough in his work to hear it.,"""Did you notice the handwriting?""",he demanded.,"""Yes,"" was the reply; ""so far as I _could_ notice the style of a handwriting that floated in air.""","""Man's or woman's?""",Hatch was puzzled.,"""I couldn't judge,"" he said.","""It seemed to be a bold style, whatever it was.","I remember the capital D clearly.""","""Was it anything like the handwriting of the broker--what's-his-name?--Ernest Weston?""","""I never saw his handwriting.""","""Look at some of it, then, particularly the capital D's,"" instructed The Thinking Machine.","Then, after a pause: ""You say the figure is white and seems to be flaming?""","""Yes.""","""Does it give out any light?","That is, does it light up a room, for instance?""","""I don't quite know what you mean.""","""When you go into a room with a lamp,"" explained The Thinking Machine, ""it lights the room.",Does this thing do it?,"Can you see the floor or walls or anything by the light of the figure itself?""","""No,"" replied Hatch, positively.","""I'll go down with you to-morrow night,"" said the scientist, as if that were all.","""Thanks,"" replied Hatch, and he went away.",Next day about noon he called at Ernest Weston's office.,The broker was in.,"""Did you send down your man O'Heagan?""",he asked.,"""Yes,"" said the broker, and he was almost smiling.","""What happened?""","""He's outside.","I'll let him tell you.""",The broker went to the door and spoke to some one and O'Heagan entered.,"He was a big, blue-eyed Irishman, frankly freckled and red-headed--one of those men who look trouble in the face and are glad of it if the trouble can be reduced to a fighting basis.","An everlasting smile was about his lips, only now it was a bit faded.","""Tell Mr. Hatch what happened last night,"" requested the broker.",O'Heagan told it.,"He, too, had sought to get hold of the flaming figure.","As he ran for it, it disappeared, was obliterated, wiped out, gone, and he found himself groping in the darkness of the room beyond, the library.","Like Hatch, he took the nearest way out, which happened to be through a window already smashed.","""Outside,"" he went on, ""I began to think about it, and I saw there was nothing to be afraid of, but you couldn't have convinced me of that when I was inside.",I took a lantern in one hand and a revolver in the other and went all over that house.,There was nothing; if there had been we would have had it out right there.,But there was nothing.,"So I started out to the barn, where I had put a cot in a room.","""I went upstairs to this room--it was then about two o'clock--and went to sleep.",It seemed to be an hour or so later when I awoke suddenly--I knew something was happening.,"And the Lord forgive me if I'm a liar, but there was a cat--a ghost cat in my room, racing around like mad.",I just naturally got up to see what was the matter and rushed for the door.,"The cat beat me to it, and cut a flaming streak through the night.","""The cat looked just like the thing inside the house--that is, it was a sort of shadowy, waving white light like it might be afire.","I went back to bed in disgust, to sleep it off.","You see, sir,"" he apologized to Weston, ""that there hadn't been anything yet I could put my hands on.""","""Was that all?""","asked Hatch, smilingly.","""Just the beginning.","Next morning when I awoke I was bound to my cot, hard and fast.","My hands were tied and my feet were tied, and all I could do was lie there and yell.","After awhile, it seemed years, I heard some one outside and shouted louder than ever.",Then the constable come up and let me loose.,I told him all about it--and then I came to Boston.,"And with your permission, Mr. Weston, I resign right now.","I'm not afraid of anything I can fight, but when I can't get hold of it--well----"" Later Hatch joined The Thinking Machine.",They caught a train for the little village by the sea.,"On the way The Thinking Machine asked a few questions, but most of the time he was silent, squinting out the window.","Hatch respected his silence, and only answered questions.","""Did you see Ernest Weston's handwriting?""",was the first of these.,"""Yes.""","""The capital D's?""","""They are not unlike the one the--the THING wrote, but they are not wholly like it,"" was the reply.","""Do you know anyone in Providence who can get some information for you?""",was the next query.,"""Yes.""","""Get him by long-distance 'phone when we get to this place and let me talk to him a moment.""",Half an hour later The Thinking Machine was talking over the long-distance 'phone to the Providence correspondent of Hatch's paper.,"What he said or what he learned there was not revealed to the wondering reporter, but he came out after several minutes, only to re-enter the booth and remain for another half an hour.","""Now,"" he said.",Together they went to the haunted house.,At the entrance to the grounds something else occurred to The Thinking Machine.,"""Run over to the 'phone and call Weston,"" he directed.","""Ask him if he has a motor-boat or if his cousin has one.",We might need one.,"Also find out what kind of a boat it is--electric or gasoline.""","Hatch returned to the village and left the scientist alone, sitting on the veranda gazing out over the sea.",When Hatch returned he was still in the same position.,"""Well?""",he asked.,"""Ernest Weston has no motor-boat,"" the reporter informed him.","""George Weston has an electric, but we can't get it because it is away.","Maybe I can get one somewhere else if you particularly want it.""","""Never

that, contrary to custom, she went home; that she used it liberally in her room; and that she destroyed a large bottle of violet perfume which you, Mr. Dunston, had given her.","I ascertained also that her room was disarranged, particularly the couch.","I assume from this that when she went to the office in the morning she did not have the money about her;

here he placed on canvas an elusive portrayal of success in its fullest and widest meaning.,"One's first impression of the picture is that it is sensual; another glance shows the underlying typification of success, and love and life are there.",One by one the qualities stand forth.,The artist was Constans St. George.,After the first flurry of excitement which the picture caused there came a whirlwind of criticism.,"Then the artist, who had labored for months on the work which he had intended and which proved to be his masterpiece, collapsed.",Some said it was overwork--they were partly right; others that it was grief at the attacks of critics who did not see beyond the surface of the painting.,"Perhaps they, too, were partly right.","However that may be, it is a fact that for several months after the picture was exhibited St. George was in a sanitarium.","The physicians said it was nervous collapse--a total breaking-down, and there were fears for his sanity.","At length there came an improvement in his condition, and he returned to the world.","Since then he had lived quietly in his studio, one of many in a large office building.","From time to time he had been approached with offers for the picture, but always he refused to sell.","A New York millionaire made a flat proposition of fifty thousand dollars, which was as flatly refused.",The artist loved the picture as a child of his own brain; every day he visited the museum where it was exhibited and stood looking at it with something almost like adoration in his eyes.,"Then he went away quietly, tugging at his straggling beard and with the dim blindness of tears in his eyes.",He never spoke to anyone; and always avoided that moment when a crowd was about.,"Whatever the verdict of the critics or of the public on ""Fulfillment,"" it was an admitted fact that the artist had placed on canvas a representation of a wonderfully beautiful woman.","Therefore, after awhile the question of who had been the model for ""Fulfillment"" was aroused.","No one knew, apparently.",Artists who knew St. George could give no idea--they only knew that the woman who had posed was not a professional model.,"This led to speculation, in which the names of some of the most beautiful women in the United States were mentioned.",Then a romance was woven.,This was that the artist was in love with the original and that his collapse was partly due to her refusal to wed him.,"This story, as it went, was elaborated until the artist was said to be pining away for love of one whom he had immortalized in oils.","As the story grew it gained credence, and a search was still made occasionally for the model.","Half a dozen times Hutchinson Hatch, a newspaper reporter of more than usual astuteness, had been on the story without success;
