"A bird in an empty house Sad echoes makes to ring, Flitting from room to room   On restless wing: Till from its shades he flies, And leaves forlorn and dim The narrow solitudes   So strange to him.","So, when with fickle heart I joyed in the passing day, A presence my mood estranged   Went grieved away.","THE TIRED CUPID The thin moonlight with trickling ray, Thridding the boughs of silver may, Trembles in beauty, pale and cool, On folded flower, and mantled pool.","All in a haze the rushes lean-- And he--he sits, with chin between His two cold hands; his bare feet set Deep in the grasses, green and wet.","About his head a hundred rings Of gold loop down to meet his wings, Whose feathers arched their stillness through Gleam with slow-gathering drops of dew.","The mouse-bat peers; the stealthy vole Creeps from the covert of its hole; A shimmering moth its pinions furls, Grey in the moonshine of his curls; 'Neath the faint stars the night-airs stray, Scattering the fragrance of the may; And with each stirring of the bough Shadow beclouds his childlike brow.","DREAMS Be gentle, O hands of a child; Be true: like a shadowy sea In the starry darkness of night   Are your eyes to me.","But words are shallow, and soon Dreams fade that the heart once knew;

and oh, much darker, she, Whose eyes in deep night darkness gaze on me.","No stars surround her; yet the moon seems hid Afar somewhere, beneath that narrow lid.","She darkens against the darkness; and her face Only by adding thought to thought I trace, Limned shadowily: O dream, return once more To gloomy Hades and the whispering shore!",BE ANGRY NOW NO MORE Be angry now no more!,"If I have grieved thee--if Thy kindness, mine before, No hope may now restore: Only forgive, forgive!","If still resentment burns In thy cold breast, oh if No more to pity turns, No more, once tender, yearns Thy love;

When, if I crossed The crystal verge of death, Him I should see Who these sounds murmureth.","Sweet sounds, begone-- Ask not my heart to break Its bond of bravery for Sweet quiet's sake; Lure not my feet To leave the path they must Tread on, unfaltering, Till I sleep in dust.","Sweet sounds, begone: Though silence brings apace Deadly disquiet Of this homeless place; And all I love In beauty cries to me, 'We but vain shadows And reflections be.'","ALL THAT'S PAST Very old are the woods;   And the buds that break Out of the briar's boughs,   When March winds wake, So old with their beauty are--   Oh, no man knows Through what wild centuries   Roves back the rose.","Very old are the brooks;   And the rills that rise Where snow sleeps cold beneath   The azure skies Sing such a history   Of come and gone, Their every drop is as wise   As Solomon.","Very old are we men;   Our dreams are tales Told in dim Eden   By Eve's nightingales; We wake and whisper awhile,   But, the day gone by, Silence and sleep like fields   Of amaranth lie.","WHEN THE ROSE IS FADED When the rose is faded, Memory may still dwell on Her beauty shadowed, And the sweet smell gone.","That vanishing loveliness, That burdening breath No bond of life hath then Nor grief of death.",'Tis the immortal thought Whose passion still Makes of the changing The unchangeable.,"Oh, thus thy beauty, Loveliest on earth to me, Dark with no sorrow, shines And burns, with Thee.","SLEEP Men all, and birds, and creeping beasts, When the dark of night is deep, From the moving wonder of their lives Commit themselves to sleep.","Without a thought, or fear, they shut The narrow gates of sense; Heedless and quiet, in slumber turn Their strength to impotence.","The transient strangeness of the earth Their spirits no more see: Within a silent gloom withdrawn, They slumber in secrecy.",Two worlds they have--a globe forgot Wheeling from dark to light; And all the enchanted realm of dream That burgeons out of night.,"THE STRANGER   Half-hidden in a graveyard,   In the blackness of a yew, Where never living creature stirs,   Nor sunbeam pierces through,   Is a tombstone green and crooked,   Its faded legend gone, And but one rain-worn cherub's head   To sing of the unknown.","There, when the dusk is falling,   Silence broods so deep It seems that every wind that breathes   Blows from the fields of sleep?","Day breaks in heedless beauty,   Kindling each drop of dew, But unforsaking shadow dwells   Beneath this lonely yew.","And, all else lost and faded,   Only this listening head Keeps with a strange unanswering smile   Its secret with the dead.","NEVER MORE, SAILOR Never more, Sailor, Shalt thou be Tossed on the wind-ridden, Restless sea.",Its tides may labour; All the world Shake 'neath that weight Of waters hurled: But its whole shock Can only stir Thy dust to a quiet Even quieter.,Thou mock'd'st at land Who now art come To such a small And shallow home; Yet bore the sea Full many a care For bones that once A sailor's were.,"And though the grave's Deep soundlessness Thy once sea-deafened Ear distress, No robin ever On the deep Hopped with his song To haunt thy sleep.","THE WITCH Weary went the old Witch, Weary of her pack, She sat her down by the churchyard wall, And jerked it off her back.","The cord brake, yes, the cord brake, Just where the dead did lie, And Charms and Spells and Sorceries Spilled out beneath the sky.","Weary was the old Witch; She rested her old eyes From the lantern-fruited yew trees, And the scarlet of the skies; And out the dead came stumbling, From every rift and crack, Silent as moss, and plundered The gaping pack.","They wish them, three times over, Away they skip full soon: Bat and Mole and Leveret, Under the rising moon; Owl and Newt and Nightjar: They take their shapes and creep, Silent as churchyard lichen, While she squats asleep.","All of these dead were stirring: Each unto each did call, 'A Witch, a Witch is sleeping Under the churchyard wall; 'A Witch, a Witch is sleeping....' The shrillness ebbed away; And up the way-worn moon clomb bright, Hard on the track of day.","She shone, high, wan and silvery; Day's colours paled and died: And, save the mute and creeping worm, Nought else was there beside.","Names may be writ; and mounds rise; Purporting, Here be bones: But empty is that churchyard Of all save stones.","Owl and Newt and Nightjar, Leveret, Bat and Mole Haunt and call in the twilight, Where she slept, poor soul.","ARABIA Far are the shades of Arabia, Where the Princes ride at noon, 'Mid the verdurous vales and thickets, Under the ghost of the moon; And so dark is that vaulted purple Flowers in the forest rise And toss into blossom 'gainst the phantom stars Pale in the noonday skies.","Sweet is the music of Arabia In my heart, when out of dreams I still in the thin clear mirk of dawn Descry her gliding streams; Hear her strange lutes on the green banks Ring loud with the grief and delight Of the dim-silked, dark-haired Musicians In the brooding silence of night.","They haunt me--her lutes and her forests; No beauty on earth I see But shadowed with that dream recalls Her loveliness to me: Still eyes look coldly upon me, Cold voices whisper and say-- 'He is crazed with the spell of far Arabia, They have stolen his wits away.'","THE MOUNTAINS Still, and blanched, and cold, and lone, The icy hills far off from me With frosty ulys overgrown Stand in their sculptured secrecy.","No path of theirs the chamois fleet Treads, with a nostril to the wind; O'er their ice-marbled glaciers beat No wings of eagles in my mind-- Yea, in my mind these mountains rise, Their perils dyed with evening's rose; And still my ghost sits at my eyes And thirsts for their untroubled snows.","QUEEN DJENIRA When Queen Djenira slumbers through   The sultry noon's repose, From out her dreams, as soft she lies,   A faint thin music flows.","Her lovely hands lie narrow and pale   With gilded nails, her head Couched in its banded nets of gold   Lies pillowed on her bed.","The little Nubian boys who fan   Her cheeks and tresses clear, Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful voices   Seem afar to hear.","They slide their eyes, and nodding, say,   'Queen Djenira walks to-day The courts of the lord Pthamasar   Where the sweet birds of Psuthys are.'","And those of earth about her porch   Of shadow cool and grey Their sidelong beaks in silence lean,   And silent flit away.","NEVER-TO-BE Down by the waters of the sea, Reigns the King of Never-to-be.","His palace walls are black with night; His torches star and moones light, And for his timepiece deep and grave Beats on the green unhastening wave.","Windswept are his high corridors; His pleasance the sea-mantled shores; For sentinel a shadow stands With hair in heaven, and cloudy hands; And round his bed, king's guards to be, Watch pines in iron solemnity.","His hound is mute; his steed at will Roams pastures deep with asphodel; His queen is to her slumber gone; His courtiers mute lie, hewn in stone; He hath forgot where he did hide His sceptre in the mountain-side.","Grey-capped and muttering, mad is he-- The childless King of Never-to-be; For all his people in the deep Keep everlasting fast asleep; And all his realm is foam and rain, Whispering of what comes not again.","THE DARK CHATEAU In dreams a dark chateau   Stands ever open to me, In far ravines dream-waters flow,   Descending soundlessly; Above its peaks the eagle floats,   Lone in a sunless sky; Mute are the golden woodland throats   Of the birds flitting by.",No voice is audible.,The wind   Sleeps in its peace.,"No flower of the light can find   Refuge 'neath its trees; Only the darkening ivy climbs   Mingled with wilding rose, And cypress, morn and evening, time's   Black shadow throws.","All vacant, and unknown;   Only the dreamer steps From stone to hollow stone,   Where the green moss sleeps, Peers at the river in its deeps,   The eagle lone in the sky, While the dew of evening drips,   Coldly and silently.","Would that I could press in!--   Into each secret room; Would that my sleep-bright eyes could win   To the inner gloom; Gaze from its high windows,   Far down its mouldering walls, Where amber-clear still Lethe flows,   And foaming falls.","But ever as I gaze,   From slumber soft doth come Some touch my stagnant sense to raise   To its old earthly home; Fades then that sky serene;   And peak of ageless snow; Fades to a paling dawn-lit green,   My dark chateau.","THE DWELLING-PLACE Deep in a forest where the kestrel screamed, Beside a lake of water, clear as glass, The time-worn windows of a stone house gleamed,       Named only 'Alas.'","Yet happy as the wild birds in the glades Of that green forest, thridding the still air With low continued heedless serenades,       Its heedless people were.","The throbbing chords of violin and lute, The lustre of lean tapers in dark eyes, Fair colours, beauteous flowers, dainty fruit       Made earth seem Paradise To them that dwelt within this lonely house: Like children of the gods in lasting peace, They ate, sang, danced, as if each day's carouse       Need never pause, nor cease.","Some might cry, Vanity!","to a weeping lyre, Some in that deep pool mock their longings vain, Came yet at last long silence to the wire,       And dark did dark remain.","Some to the hunt would wend, with hound and horn, And clash of silver, beauty, bravery, pride, Heeding not one who on white horse upborne       With soundless hoofs did ride.",Dreamers there were who watched the hours away Beside a fountain's foam.,"And in the sweet Of phantom evening, 'neath the night-bird's lay,       Did loved with loved-one meet.","All, all were children, for, the long day done, They barred the heavy door 'gainst lightfoot fear; And few words spake though one known face was gone,       Yet still seemed hovering near.",They heaped the bright fire higher; poured dark wine; And in long revelry dazed the questioning eye; Curtained three-fold the heart-dismaying shine       Of midnight streaming by.,"They shut the dark out from the painted wall, With candles dared the shadow at the door, Sang down the faint reiterated call       Of those who came no more.","Yet clear above that portal plain was writ, Confronting each at length alone to pass Out of its beauty into night star-lit,       That worn 'Alas!'",THE LISTENERS 'Is there anybody there?',"said the Traveller,   Knocking on the moonlit door; And his horse in the silence champed the grasses   Of the forest's ferny floor: And a bird flew up out of the turret,   Above the Traveller's head: And he smote upon the door again a second time;   'Is there anybody there?'",he said.,"But no one descended to the Traveller;   No head from the leaf-fringed sill Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,   Where he stood perplexed and still.","But only a host of phantom listeners   That dwelt in the lone house then Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight   To that voice from the world of men: Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,   That goes down to the empty hall, Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken   By the lonely Traveller's call.","And he felt in his heart their strangeness,   Their stillness answering his cry, While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,   'Neath the starred and leafy sky; For he suddenly smote on the door, even   Louder, and lifted his head:-- 'Tell them I came, and no one answered,   That I kept my word,' he said.","Never the least stir made the listeners,   Though every word he spake Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house   From the one man left awake: Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,   And the sound of iron on stone, And how the silence surged softly backward,   When the plunging hoofs were gone.","TIME PASSES     There was nought in the Valley     But a Tower of Ivory, Its base enwreathed with red     Flowers that at evening     Caught the sun's crimson As to Ocean low he sped.","Lucent and lovely     It stood in the morning Under a trackless hill;     With snows eternal     Muffling its summit, And silence ineffable.",Sighing of solitude     Winds from the cold heights Haunted its yellowing stone;     At noon its shadow     Stretched athwart cedars Whence every bird was flown.,"Its stair was broken,     Its starlit walls were Fretted; its flowers shone     Wide at the portal,     Full-blown and fading, Their last faint fragrance gone.","And on high in its lantern     A shape of the living Watched o'er a shoreless sea,     From a Tower rotting     With age and weakness, Once lovely as ivory.",BEWARE!,"An ominous bird sang from its branch,   'Beware, O Wanderer!","Night 'mid her flowers of glamourie spilled   Draws swiftly near: 'Night with her darkened caravans,   Piled deep with silver and myrrh, Draws from the portals of the East,   O Wanderer near!",'Night who walks plumed through the fields   Of stars that strangely stir-- Smitten to fire by the sandals of him   Who walks with her.',"THE JOURNEY Heart-sick of his journey was the Wanderer;   Footsore and sad was he; And a Witch who long had lurked by the wayside,   Looked out of sorcery.","'Lift up your eyes, you lonely Wanderer,'   She peeped from her casement small; 'Here's shelter and quiet to give you rest, young man,   And apples for thirst withal.'","And he looked up out of his sad reverie,   And saw all the woods in green, With birds that flitted feathered in the dappling,   The jewel-bright leaves between.","And he lifted up his face towards her lattice,   And there, alluring-wise, Slanting through the silence of the long past,   Dwelt the still green Witch's eyes.",And vaguely from the hiding-place of memory   Voices seemed to cry; 'What is the darkness of one brief life-time   To the deaths thou hast made us die?,'Heed not the words of the Enchantress   Who would us still betray!',"And sad with the echo of their reproaches,   Doubting, he turned away.","'I may not shelter 'neath your roof, lady,   Nor in this wood's green shadow seek repose, Nor will your apples quench the thirst   A homesick wanderer knows.'","'""Homesick,"" forsooth!'",she softly mocked him:   And the beauty in her face Made in the sunshine pale and trembling   A stillness in that place.,"And he sighed, as if in fear, the young Wanderer,   Looking to left and to right, Where the endless narrow road swept onward,   In the distance lost to sight.","And there fell upon his sense the briar,   Haunting the air with its breath, And the faint shrill sweetness of the birds' throats,   Their tent of leaves beneath.","And there was the Witch, in no wise heeding;   Her arbour, and fruit-filled dish, Her pitcher of well-water, and clear damask--   All that the weary wish.","And the last gold beam across the green world   Faltered and failed, as he Remembered his solitude and the dark night's   Inhospitality.","His shoulders were bowed with his knapsack;   His staff trailed heavy in the dust; His eyes were dazed, and hopeless of the white road   Which tread all pilgrims must.",And he looked upon the Witch with eyes of sorrow   In the darkening of the day; And turned him aside into oblivion;   And the voices died away.... And the Witch stepped down from her casement:   In the hush of night he heard The calling and wailing in dewy thicket   Of bird to hidden bird.,And gloom stole all her burning crimson;   Remote and faint in space As stars in gathering shadow of the evening   Seemed now her phantom face.,"And one night's rest shall be a myriad,   Midst dreams that come and go; Till heedless fate, unmoved by weakness, bring him   This same strange by-way through: To the beauty of earth that fades in ashes,   The lips of welcome, and the eyes More beauteous than the feeble shine of Hesper   Lone in the lightening skies: Till once again the Witch's guile entreat him;   But, worn with wisdom, he Steadfast and cold shall choose the dark night's   Inhospitality.","HAUNTED The rabbit in his burrow keeps No guarded watch, in peace he sleeps; The wolf that howls into the night Cowers to her lair at morning light; The simplest bird entwines a nest Where she may lean her lovely breast, Couched in the silence of the bough; But thou, O man, what rest hast thou?","The deepest solitude can bring Only a subtler questioning In thy divided heart; thy bed Recalls at dawn what midnight said; Seek how thou wilt to feign content Thy flaming ardour's quickly spent; Soon thy last company is gone, And leaves thee--with thyself--alone.","Pomp and great friends may hem thee round, A thousand busy tasks be found; Earth's thronging beauties may beguile Thy longing lovesick heart awhile; And pride, like clouds of sunset, spread A changing glory round thy head; But fade will all; and thou must come, Hating thy journey, homeless, home.","Rave how thou wilt; unmoved, remote, That inward presence slumbers not, Frets out each secret from thy breast, Gives thee no rally, pause, nor rest, Scans close thy very thoughts, lest they Should sap his patient power away, Answers thy wrath with peace, thy cry With tenderest taciturnity.","SILENCE With changeful sound life beats upon the ear;   Yet striving for release   The most delighting string's     Sweet jargonings,     The happiest throat's   Most easeful, lovely notes Fall back into a veiling silentness.","Even 'mid the rumour of a moving host,   Blackening the clear green earth,   Vainly 'gainst that thin wall     The trumpets call,     Or with loud hum   The smoke-bemuffled drum: From that high quietness no reply comes forth.","When all at peace, two friends at ease alone   Talk out their hearts,--yet still,   Between the grace-notes of     The voice of love     From each to each   Trembles a rarer speech, And with its presence every pause doth fill.","Unmoved it broods, this all-encompassing hush   Of one who stooping near,   No smallest stir will make     Our fear to wake;     But yet intent   Upon some mystery bent, Hearkens the lightest word we say, or hear.","WINTER DUSK Dark frost was in the air without, The dusk was still with cold and gloom, When less than even a shadow came   And stood within the room.","But of the three around the fire, None turned a questioning head to look, Still read a clear voice, on and on,   Still stooped they o'er their book.","The children watched their mother's eyes Moving on softly line to line; It seemed to listen too--that shade,   Yet made no outward sign.","The fire-flames crooned a tiny song, No cold wind moved the wintry tree; The children both in Faerie dreamed   Beside their mother's knee.","And nearer yet that spirit drew Above that heedless one, intent Only on what the simple words   Of her small story meant.","No voiceless sorrow grieved her mind, No memory her bosom stirred, Nor dreamed she, as she read to two,   'Twas surely three who heard.","Yet when, the story done, she smiled From face to face, serene and clear, A love, half dread, sprang up, as she   Leaned close and drew them near.","AGES AGO Launcelot loved Guinevere,   Ages and ages ago, Beautiful as a bird was she, Preening its wings in a cypress tree, Happy in sadness, she and he,   They loved each other so.","Helen of Troy was beautiful   As tender flower in May, Her loveliness from the towers looked down, With the sweet moon for silver crown, Over the walls of Troy Town,   Hundreds of years away.","Cleopatra, Egypt's Queen,   Was wondrous kind to ken, As when the stars in the dark sky Like buds on thorny branches lie, So seemed she too to Antony,   That age-gone prince of men.","The Pyramids are old stones,   Scarred is that grey face, That by the greenness of Old Nile Gazes with an unchanging smile, Man with all mystery to beguile   And give his thinking grace.","HOME Rest, rest--there is no rest, Until the quiet grave Comes with its narrow arch   The heart to save From life's long cankering rust, From torpor, cold and still-- The loveless, saddened dust,   The jaded will.","And yet, be far the hour Whose haven calls me home; Long be the arduous day   Till evening come; What sureness now remains But that through livelong strife Only the loser gains   An end to life?","Then in the soundless deep Of even the shallowest grave Childhood and love he'll keep,   And his soul save; All vext desire, all vain Cries of a conflict done Fallen to rest again;   Death's refuge won.","THE GHOST       Peace in thy hands,       Peace in thine eyes,       Peace on thy brow; Flower of a moment in the eternal hour,       Peace with me now.","Not a wave breaks,       Not a bird calls,       My heart, like a sea, Silent after a storm that hath died,       Sleeps within me.","All the night's dews,       All the world's leaves,       All winter's snow Seem with their quiet to have stilled in life's dream       All sorrowing now.","AN EPITAPH Here lies a most beautiful lady, Light of step and heart was she; I think she was the most beautiful lady That ever was in the West Country.","But beauty vanishes; beauty passes; However rare--rare it be; And when I crumble, who will remember This lady of the West Country?","'THE HAWTHORN HATH A DEATHLY SMELL' The flowers of the field   Have a sweet smell; Meadowsweet, tansy, thyme,   And faint-heart pimpernel; But sweeter even than these,   The silver of the may Wreathed is with incense for   The Judgment Day.","An apple, a child, dust,   When falls the evening rain, Wild briar's spiced leaves,   Breathe memories again; With further memory fraught,   The silver of the may Wreathed is with incense for   The Judgment Day.","Eyes of all loveliness--   Shadow of strange delight, Even as a flower fades   Must thou from sight; But oh, o'er thy grave's mound,   Till come the Judgment Day, Wreathed shall with incense be   Thy sharp-thorned may.","_The Third Edition, Revised and Enlarged, of_ THE HOME BOOK OF VERSE COMPILED BY BURTON E.

And there for delight of so gladsome a sight,   Walked a most beautiful lady,   Dreamed a most beautiful lady.","Birds in those branches did sing,   Blackbird and throstle and linnet, But she walking there was by far the most fair--   Lovelier than all else within it,   Blackbird and throstle and linnet.","But blossoms to berries do come,   All hanging on stalks light and slender, And one long summer's day charmed that lady away,   With vows sweet and merry and tender;   A lover with voice low and tender.","Moss and lichen the green branches deck;   Weeds nod in its paths green and shady: Yet a light footstep seems there to wander in dreams,   The ghost of that beautiful lady,   That happy and beautiful lady.","OLD SUSAN When Susan's work was done she'd sit, With one fat guttering candle lit, And window opened wide to win The sweet night air to enter in; There, with a thumb to keep her place She'd read, with stern and wrinkled face, Her mild eyes gliding very slow Across the letters to and fro, While wagged the guttering candle flame In the wind that through the window came.","And sometimes in the silence she Would mumble a sentence audibly, Or shake her head as if to say, 'You silly souls, to act this way!'","And never a sound from night I'd hear, Unless some far-off cock crowed clear; Or her old shuffling thumb should turn Another page; and rapt and stern, Through her great glasses bent on me She'd glance into reality; And shake her round old silvery head, With--'You!--I thought you was in bed!'","-- Only to tilt her book again, And rooted in Romance remain.","OLD BEN Sad is old Ben Thistlewaite,   Now his day is done, And all his children   Far away are gone.","He sits beneath his jasmined porch,   His stick between his knees, His eyes fixed vacant   On his moss-grown trees.","Grass springs in the green path,   His flowers are lean and dry, His thatch hangs in wisps against   The evening sky.","He has no heart to care now,   Though the winds will blow Whistling in his casement,   And the rain drip thro'.","He thinks of his old Bettie,   How she'd shake her head and say, 'You'll live to wish my sharp old tongue   Could scold--some day,' But as in pale high autumn skies   The swallows float and play, His restless thoughts pass to and fro,   But nowhere stay.","Soft, on the morrow, they are gone;   His garden then will be Denser and shadier and greener,   Greener the moss-grown tree.","MISS LOO When thin-strewn memory I look through, I see most clearly poor Miss Loo, Her tabby cat, her cage of birds, Her nose, her hair--her muffled words, And how she'd open her green eyes, As if in some immense surprise, Whenever as we sat at tea She made some small remark to me.","It's always drowsy summer when From out the past she comes again; The westering sunshine in a pool Floats in her parlour still and cool; While the slim bird its lean wires shakes, As into piercing song it breaks; Till Peter's pale-green eyes ajar Dream, wake; wake, dream, in one brief bar.","And I am sitting, dull and shy, And she with gaze of vacancy, And large hands folded on the tray, Musing the afternoon away; Her satin bosom heaving slow With sighs that softly ebb and flow, And her plain face in such dismay, It seems unkind to look her way: Until all cheerful back will come Her cheerful gleaming spirit home: And one would think that poor Miss Loo Asked nothing else, if she had you.","THE TAILOR Few footsteps stray when dusk droops o'er The tailor's old stone-lintelled door: There sits he stitching half asleep, Beside his smoky tallow dip.","'Click, click,' his needle hastes, and shrill Cries back the cricket 'neath the sill.","Sometimes he stays, and o'er his thread Leans sidelong his old tousled head; Or stoops to peer with half-shut eye When some strange footfall echoes by; Till clearer gleams his candle's spark Into the dusty summer dark.","Then from his crosslegs he gets down, To find how dark the evening's grown; And hunched-up in his door he'll hear The cricket whistling crisp and clear; And so beneath the starry grey Will mutter half a seam away.","MARTHA 'Once ... once upon a time ...'   Over and over again, Martha would tell us her stories,   In the hazel glen.","Hers were those clear grey eyes   You watch, and the story seems Told by their beautifulness   Tranquil as dreams.","She'd sit with her two slim hands   Clasped round her bended knees; While we on our elbows lolled,   And stared at ease.","Her voice and her narrow chin,   Her grave small lovely head, Seemed half the meaning   Of the words she said.","'Once ... once upon a time ...'   Like a dream you dream in the night, Fairies and gnomes stole out   In the leaf-green light.","And her beauty far away   Would fade, as her voice ran on, Till hazel and summer sun   And all were gone:-- All fordone and forgot;   And like clouds in the height of the sky, Our hearts stood still in the hush   Of an age gone by.","THE SLEEPER As Ann came in one summer's day,   She felt that she must creep, So silent was the clear cool house,   It seemed a house of sleep.","And sure, when she pushed open the door,   Rapt in the stillness there, Her mother sat, with stooping head,   Asleep upon a chair; Fast--fast asleep; her two hands laid   Loose-folded on her knee, So that her small unconscious face   Looked half unreal to be: So calmly lit with sleep's pale light   Each feature was; so fair Her forehead--every trouble was   Smooth'd out beneath her hair.","But though her mind in dream now moved,   Still seemed her gaze to rest From out beneath her fast-sealed lids,   Above her moving breast, On Ann, as quite, quite still she stood;   Yet slumber lay so deep Even her hands upon her lap   Seemed saturate with sleep.","And as Ann peeped, a cloudlike dread   Stole over her, and then, On stealthy, mouselike feet she trod,   And tiptoed out again.","THE KEYS OF MORNING While at her bedroom window once,   Learning her task for school, Little Louisa lonely sat   In the morning clear and cool, She slanted her small bead-brown eyes   Across the empty street, And saw Death softly watching her   In the sunshine pale and sweet.","His was a long lean sallow face,   He sat with half-shut eyes, Like an old sailor in a ship   Becalmed 'neath tropic skies.","Beside him in the dust he'd set   His staff and shady hat; These, peeping small, Louisa saw   Quite clearly where she sat-- The thinness of his coal-black locks,   His hands so long and lean They scarcely seemed to grasp at all   The keys that hung between: Both were of gold, but one was small,   And with this last did he Wag in the air, as if to say,   'Come hither, child, to me!'","Louisa laid her lesson book   On the cold window-sill; And in the sleepy sunshine house   Went softly down, until She stood in the half-opened door,   And peeped; but strange to say, Where Death just now had sunning sat   Only a shadow lay;-- Just the tall chimney's round-topped cowl,   And the small sun behind, Had with its shadow in the dust   Called sleepy Death to mind.","But most she thought how strange it was   Two keys that he should bear, And that, when beckoning, he should wag   The littlest in the air.","RACHEL Rachel sings sweet--   Oh yes, at night, Her pale face bent   In the candle-light, Her slim hands touch   The answering keys, And she sings of hope   And of memories: Sings to the little   Boy that stands Watching those slim,   Light, heedful hands.","He looks in her face;   Her dark eyes seem Dark with a beautiful   Distant dream; And still she plays,   Sings tenderly To him of hope,   And of memory.","ALONE A very old woman Lives in yon house-- The squeak of the cricket, The stir of the mouse, Are all she knows Of the earth and us.","Once she was young, Would dance and play, Like many another Young popinjay; And run to her mother At dusk of day.","And colours bright She delighted in; The fiddle to hear, And to lift her chin, And sing as small As a twittering wren.",But age apace Comes at last to all; And a lone house filled With the cricket's call; And the scampering mouse In the hollow wall.,"THE BELLS Shadow and light both strove to be The eight bell-ringers' company, As with his gliding rope in hand, Counting his changes, each did stand; While rang and trembled every stone, To music by the bell-mouths blown, Till the bright clouds that towered on high Seemed to re-echo cry with cry.","Still swang the clappers to and fro, When, in the far-spread fields below, I saw a ploughman with his team Lift to the bells and fix on them His distant eyes, as if he would Drink in the utmost sound he could; While near him sat his children three, And in the green grass placidly Played undistracted on, as if What music earthly bells might give Could only faintly stir their dream, And stillness make more lovely seem.","Soon night hid horses, children, all In sleep deep and ambrosial; Yet, yet it seemed from star to star, Welling now near, now faint and far, Those echoing bells rang on in dream, And stillness made even lovelier seem.","THE SCARECROW All winter through I bow my head   Beneath the driving rain; The North wind powders me with snow   And blows me black again; At midnight 'neath a maze of stars   I flame with glittering rime, And stand, above the stubble, stiff   As mail at morning-prime.","But when that child, called Spring, and all   His host of children, come, Scattering their buds and dew upon   Those acres of my home, Some rapture in my rags awakes;   I lift void eyes and scan The skies for crows, those ravening foes,   Of my strange master, Man.","I watch him striding lank behind   His clashing team, and know Soon will the wheat swish body high   Where once lay sterile snow; Soon shall I gaze across a sea   Of sun-begotten grain, Which my unflinching watch hath sealed   For harvest once again.","NOD Softly along the road of evening,   In a twilight dim with rose, Wrinkled with age, and drenched with dew   Old Nod, the shepherd, goes.","His drowsy flock streams on before him,   Their fleeces charged with gold, To where the sun's last beam leans low   On Nod the shepherd's fold.","The hedge is quick and green with briar,   From their sand the conies creep;

His torches star and moonès light, And for his timepiece deep and grave Beats on the green unhastening wave.","Windswept are his high corridors; His pleasance the sea-mantled shores; For sentinel a shadow stands With hair in heaven, and cloudy hands;

Would that my sleep-bright eyes could win   To the inner gloom; Gaze from its high windows,   Far down its mouldering walls, Where amber-clear still Lethe flows,   And foaming falls.","But ever as I gaze,   From slumber soft doth come Some touch my stagnant sense to raise   To its old earthly home;

'What is the darkness of one brief life-time   To the deaths thou hast made us die?,'Heed not the words of the Enchantress   Who would us still betray!',"And sad with the echo of their reproaches,   Doubting, he turned away.","'I may not shelter 'neath your roof, lady,   Nor in this wood's green shadow seek repose, Nor will your apples quench the thirst   A homesick wanderer knows.'","'""Homesick,"" forsooth!'",she softly mocked him:   And the beauty in her face Made in the sunshine pale and trembling   A stillness in that place.,"And he sighed, as if in fear, the young Wanderer,   Looking to left and to right, Where the endless narrow road swept onward,   In the distance lost to sight.","And there fell upon his sense the briar,   Haunting the air with its breath, And the faint shrill sweetness of the birds' throats,   Their tent of leaves beneath.","And there was the Witch, in no wise heeding;   Her arbour, and fruit-filled dish, Her pitcher of well-water, and clear damask--   All that the weary wish.","And the last gold beam across the green world   Faltered and failed, as he Remembered his solitude and the dark night's   Inhospitality.","His shoulders were bowed with his knapsack;   His staff trailed heavy in the dust; His eyes were dazed, and hopeless of the white road   Which tread all pilgrims must.",And he looked upon the Witch with eyes of sorrow   In the darkening of the day; And turned him aside into oblivion;   And the voices died away.... And the Witch stepped down from her casement:   In the hush of night he heard The calling and wailing in dewy thicket   Of bird to hidden bird.,And gloom stole all her burning crimson;   Remote and faint in space As stars in gathering shadow of the evening   Seemed now her phantom face.,"And one night's rest shall be a myriad,   Midst dreams that come and go; Till heedless fate, unmoved by weakness, bring him   This same strange by-way through: To the beauty of earth that fades in ashes,   The lips of welcome, and the eyes More beauteous than the feeble shine of Hesper   Lone in the lightening skies: Till once again the Witch's guile entreat him;   But, worn with wisdom, he Steadfast and cold shall choose the dark night's   Inhospitality.","HAUNTED The rabbit in his burrow keeps No guarded watch, in peace he sleeps; The wolf that howls into the night Cowers to her lair at morning light; The simplest bird entwines a nest Where she may lean her lovely breast, Couched in the silence of the bough; But thou, O man, what rest hast thou?","The deepest solitude can bring Only a subtler questioning In thy divided heart; thy bed Recalls at dawn what midnight said; Seek how thou wilt to feign content Thy flaming ardour's quickly spent; Soon thy last company is gone, And leaves thee--with thyself--alone.","Pomp and great friends may hem thee round, A thousand busy tasks be found; Earth's thronging beauties may beguile Thy longing lovesick heart awhile; And pride, like clouds of sunset, spread A changing glory round thy head; But fade will all; and thou must come, Hating thy journey, homeless, home.","Rave how thou wilt; unmoved, remote, That inward presence slumbers not, Frets out each secret from thy breast, Gives thee no rally, pause, nor rest, Scans close thy very thoughts, lest they Should sap his patient power away, Answers thy wrath with peace, thy cry With tenderest taciturnity.","SILENCE With changeful sound life beats upon the ear;   Yet striving for release   The most delighting string's     Sweet jargonings,     The happiest throat's   Most easeful, lovely notes Fall back into a veiling silentness.","Even 'mid the rumour of a moving host,   Blackening the clear green earth,   Vainly 'gainst that thin wall     The trumpets call,     Or with loud hum   The smoke-bemuffled drum: From that high quietness no reply comes forth.","When all at peace, two friends at ease alone   Talk out their hearts,--yet still,   Between the grace-notes of     The voice of love     From each to each   Trembles a rarer speech, And with its presence every pause doth fill.","Unmoved it broods, this all-encompassing hush   Of one who stooping near,   No smallest stir will make     Our fear to wake;     But yet intent   Upon some mystery bent, Hearkens the lightest word we say, or hear.","WINTER DUSK Dark frost was in the air without, The dusk was still with cold and gloom, When less than even a shadow came   And stood within the room.","But of the three around the fire, None turned a questioning head to look, Still read a clear voice, on and on,   Still stooped they o'er their book.","The children watched their mother's eyes Moving on softly line to line; It seemed to listen too--that shade,   Yet made no outward sign.","The fire-flames crooned a tiny song, No cold wind moved the wintry tree; The children both in Faërie dreamed   Beside their mother's knee.","And nearer yet that spirit drew Above that heedless one, intent Only on what the simple words   Of her small story meant.","No voiceless sorrow grieved her mind, No memory her bosom stirred, Nor dreamed she, as she read to two,   'Twas surely three who heard.","Yet when, the story done, she smiled From face to face, serene and clear, A love, half dread, sprang up, as she   Leaned close and drew them near.","AGES AGO Launcelot loved Guinevere,   Ages and ages ago, Beautiful as a bird was she, Preening its wings in a cypress tree, Happy in sadness, she and he,   They loved each other so.","Helen of Troy was beautiful   As tender flower in May, Her loveliness from the towers looked down, With the sweet moon for silver crown, Over the walls of Troy Town,   Hundreds of years away.","Cleopatra, Egypt's Queen,   Was wondrous kind to ken, As when the stars in the dark sky Like buds on thorny branches lie, So seemed she too to Antony,   That age-gone prince of men.","The Pyramids are old stones,   Scarred is that grey face, That by the greenness of Old Nile Gazes with an unchanging smile, Man with all mystery to beguile   And give his thinking grace.","HOME Rest, rest--there is no rest, Until the quiet grave Comes with its narrow arch   The heart to save From life's long cankering rust, From torpor, cold and still-- The loveless, saddened dust,   The jaded will.","And yet, be far the hour Whose haven calls me home; Long be the arduous day   Till evening come; What sureness now remains But that through livelong strife Only the loser gains   An end to life?","Then in the soundless deep Of even the shallowest grave Childhood and love he'll keep,   And his soul save;
