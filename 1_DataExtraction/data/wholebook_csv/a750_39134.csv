they wouldn't invite me.","I'm one of the best little waiters you ever heard of; and all things come to him who waits.""","What a pleasant, affable young man he was!",thought Susan as she watched him jump into the car and go flying up the street.,Jones was a good deal surprised when Norton turned up at the old Chilton manor.,"""What made you come here dressed like this?""",the butler demanded.,"""I'm a suspicious duffer; maybe that's the reason.""","""Do you know anything?""","""Well, no; I can't say that I do.","But, hang it, I just had to come out here.""","""Maybe it's just as well you did,"" said Jones moodily.","""I know this place.","The housekeeper used to be my nurse, and if she is still on the job she may be of service to us.","You don't think they'll question or recognize me?""","""Hardly.",I'll put in a word for you.,"I'll say I sent for you, not knowing if we had enough servants to take care of the luncheon.""","""And now I'll go and hunt up Meg.""","Sure enough, his old nurse was still in charge of the house; and when her ""baby"" disclosed his identity she all but fell upon his neck.","""But what are you doing here, dressed up as a waiter?""","""It's a little secret, Meg.","I wasn't invited, and the truth is I'm very desperately in love with the young lady in whose honor this coaching party is being given.","And ... maybe she's in danger.""","""Danger?","What about?""","""The Lord only knows.",But show me about the house.,I've not been here in so long I've forgotten the run of it.,I remember one room with the secret panel and another with a painting that turned.,"Have they changed them?""","""No; it is just the same here as it used to be.","Come along and I'll show you.""","Norton inspected the rooms carefully, stowing away in his mind every detail.",He might be worrying about nothing; but so many strange things had happened that it was better to be on the side of caution than on the side of carelessness.,He left the house and ran across Jones carrying a basket of wine.,"""Here, Norton; take this to the party.","I want to reconnoiter.""","""All right, m'lud!","Say, Jones, how much do you think I'd earn at this job?""",comically.,"""Get along with you, Mr. Norton.","It may be the time to laugh, and then it may not.""","""I'm going back into the house and hide behind a secret panel.",I've got my revolver.,You go to the stables and take a try at my car; see if she works smoothly.,We may have to do some hiking.,"Where is the countess in this?""","""Leave that to me, Mr. Norton,"" said the butler with his grim smile.","""Be off; they are moving back toward the house.""","So Norton carried the basket around to the lawn, where it was taken from his hands by the regular servant.","He sighed as he saw Florence, laughing and chatting with a man who was a stranger and whom he heard addressed as count.","Some friend of the countess, no doubt.",Where was all this tangle going to end?,He wished he knew.,And what a yarn he was going to write some day!,It would read like one of Gaboriau's tales.,"He turned away to wander idly about the grounds, when beyond a clump of cedars he saw three or four men conversing slowly.","He got as near as possible, for when three or four men put their heads together and whisper animatedly, it usually means a poker game or something worse.","He caught a phrase or two as they came down the wind, and then he knew that the vague suspicion that had brought him out here had been set in motion by fate.","He heard ""Florence"" and ""the old drawing room;"" and that was enough.",He scurried about for Jones.,"It was pure luck that he had had old Meg show him through the house, otherwise he would have forgotten all about the secret panel in the wall and the painting.",Jones shrugged resignedly.,Were these men of the countess' party?,Norton couldn't say.,[Illustration: THE SECRET PANEL] Norton made his hiding place in safety; and by and by he could hear the guests moving about in the room.,Then all sounds ceased for a while.,A door closed sharply.,"""No; here you must stay, young lady,"" said a man's voice.","""What do you mean, sir?""",demanded the beloved voice.,"""It means that no one will return to this room and that you will not be missed until it is too late.""","The sound of voices stopped abruptly, and something like scuffling ensued.",Later Norton heard the back of a chair strike the panel and some one sat heavily upon it.,He waited perhaps five minutes; then he gently slid back the panel.,Florence sat bound and gagged under his very eyes.,It was but the work of a moment to liberate her.,"""It is I, Jim.",Do not speak or make the least noise.,"Follow me.""","Greatly astonished, Florence obeyed; and the panel slipped back into place.",The room behind the secret panel had barred windows.,To Florence it appeared to be a real prison.,"""How did you get here?""",she asked breathlessly.,"""Something told me to follow you.","And something is always going to tell me to follow you, Florence.""",She pressed his hand.,It was to her as if one of those book heroes had stepped out of a book; only book heroes always had tremendous fortunes and did not have to work for a living.,"Oddly enough, she was not afraid.","""Who was the man?""",he asked.,"""The Count Norfeldt.","Some one has imposed upon the countess.""","""Do you think so?""",with a strange look in his eyes.,"""What do you mean?""","""Nothing just now.",The idea is to get out of here just as quickly as we can.,"See this painting?""",He touched a spot in the wall and the painting slowly swung out like a door.,"""Come; we make our escape to the side lawn from here.""",At the stable they were confronted with the knowledge that Norton's car was out of commission; Jones could do nothing with it.,"Then Norton suggested that he make an effort to commandeer the limousine of the countess; but there were men about, so the limousine was out of the question.","""Horses!""",whispered Jones.,"""There are several saddle horses, already saddled.","How about these people, the owners?""","""Oh, they are beyond reproach.",They have doubtless been imposed upon.,But let us get aboard first.,There will be time to talk later.,"I'll have to do some explaining, taking these nags off like this.",We won't have to ride out in front where the picnickers are.,"There's a lane back of the stable, and a slight detour brings us back into the main road.""",The three mounted and clattered away.,To Florence it had the air of a prank.,She was beginning to have such confidence in these two inventive men that she felt as if she was never going to be afraid any more.,When the Countess Olga saw the three horses it was an effort not to fly into a rage.,"But secretly she warned her people, who presently gave chase in the limousine, while she prattled and jested and laughed with her company, who were quite unaware that a drama was being enacted right under their very noses.","The countess, while she acted superbly, tore her handkerchief into shreds.","There was something sinister in the way all their plans fell through at the very moment of consummation; and that night she determined to ask Braine to withdraw from this warfare, which gradually decimated their numbers without getting anywhere toward the goal.",Jones shouted that the limousine was tearing down the road.,Something must be done to stop it.,"He suggested that he drop behind, leave his horse, and take a chance at potting a tire from the shrubbery at the roadside.","""Keep going.","Don't stop, Norton, till you are back in town.","I'll manage to take good care of myself.""",CHAPTER VII When all three finally met at the Hargreave home Florence suddenly took Jones by the shoulders and kissed him lightly on the cheek.,"Jones started back, pale and disturbed.",Norton laughed.,"He did not feel the slightest twinge of jealousy, but he was eaten up with envy, as the old wives say.","""You are wondering if I suspect the Countess Perigoff?""",said Jones.,"""I am.""",This man Jones was developing into a very remarkable character.,"The reporter found himself side glancing at the thin, keen face of this resourceful butler.",The lobe of the man's left ear came within range.,"Norton reached for a cigarette, but his hands shook as he lit it.",There was a peculiar little scar in the center of the lobe.,"""Well,"" said Jones, ""I can find no evidence that she has been concerned in any of these affairs.""","""You are suspicious?""","""Of everybody,"" looking boldly into the reporter's eyes.","""Of me?""",smiling.,"""Even of myself sometimes.""",Conversation dropped entirely after this declaration.,"""You're a taciturn sort of chap.""","""Am I?""","""You are.","But an agreement is an agreement, and while I'd like to print this story, I'll not.","We newspaper men seldom break our word.""",Jones held out his hand.,"""Sometimes I wish I'd started life right,"" said the reporter gloomily.","""A newspaper man is generally improvident.",He never looks ahead for to-morrow.,"What with my special articles to the magazines, I earn between four and five thousand the year; and I've never been able to save a cent.""","""Perhaps you've never really tried,"" replied Jones, with a glance at his companion.","It was a good face, strong in outline; a little careworn, perhaps, but free from any indications of dissipation.","""If I had begun life as you did, I'd have made real and solid use of the great men I met.","I'd have made financiers help me to invest my earnings, or savings, little as they might be.","And to-day I'd be living on the income.""","""You never can tell.","Perhaps a woman might have made you think of those things; but if you had remained unattached up to thirty-one, as I have, the thought of saving might never have entered your head.","A man in my present condition, financially, has no right to think of matrimony.""","""It might be the saving of you if you met and married the right woman.""","""But the right woman might be heiress to millions.","And a poor devil like me could not marry a girl with money and hang on to his self-respect.""","""True.","But there are always exceptions to all rules in life, except those regarding health.","A healthy man is a normal man, and a normal man has no right to remain single.","You proved yourself a man this afternoon, considering that you did not know I occupied the wheel seat.","Come to think it over, you really saved the day.",You gave me the opportunity of steering straight for the police station.,"Well, good-by.""","""Queer duck!""","mused the reporter as, after telephoning, he headed for his office.","Queer duck, indeed!",What a game it was going to be!,And this man Jones was playing it like a master.,It did not matter that some one else laid down the rules; it was the way in which they were interpreted.,Braine heard of the failure.,The Black Hundred was finding its stock far below par value.,"Four valuable men locked up in the Tombs awaiting trial, to say nothing of the seven gunmen gathered in at the old warehouse.","Braine began to suspect that his failures were less due to chance than to calculation, that at last he had encountered a mind which anticipated his every move.",He would have recognized this fact earlier had it not been that revenge had temporarily blinded him.,The spirit of revenge never makes for mental clarity.,There was a meeting that night of the Black Hundred.,"Four men were told off, and they drew their chairs up to Vroon's table for instructions.",Braine sat at Vroon's elbow.,These four men composed the most dangerous quartet in New York City.,They were as daring as they were desperate.,They were the men who held up bank messengers and got away with thousands.,They had learned to swoop down upon their victims as the hawk swoops down upon the heron.,"The newspapers referred to them as the ""auto bandits,"" and the men took a deal of pride in the furore they had created.",[Illustration: FOUR MEN WERE TOLD OFF] Vroon went over the Hargreave case minutely; he left no detail unexplained.,"Bluntly and frankly, the daughter of Stanley Hargreave must be caught and turned over to the care of the Black Hundred.",It must be quick action.,Four valuable members were in the Tombs.,They might or might not weaken under pressure.,For the first time in its American career the organization stood facing actual peril; and its one possible chance of salvation lay in the fact that no one's face was known to his neighbor.,"He, Vroon, and the boss alone knew who and what each man was.","But the plans, the ramifications of the organization might become public property; and that would mean an end to an exceedingly profitable business.",The daughter of Hargreave rode horseback early every morning.,She sought the country road.,She was invariably attended by the riding master of a school near by.,"""You four will make your own plans.""","""If she should be injured?""","""Avoid it if possible.""","""We have a free hand?""","""Absolutely.""","""We risk a bad fall from her horse if it's a spirited one.""","""Pretend a breakdown in the road,"" interpolated Braine.","""As they approach, draw and order them to dismount.","That method will prevent any accident.""","""We'll plan it somehow.","It looks easy.""","""Nothing is easy where that girl is concerned.","A thousand eyes seem to be watching her slightest move.""","""We shan't leave anything to chance.","How many days will you give us?""","""Seven.","A failure, mind you, will prove unhealthy to all concerned,"" with a menace which made the four stir uneasily.",The telephone rang.,Braine reached for the receiver.,"""A man just entered the Hargreave house at the rear.","Come at once,"" was the message.","""Is your car outside?""",Braine asked.,"""We are never without it.""","""Then let us be off.","No one will stop us for speeding on a side street.""",Fourteen minutes by the clock brought the car to a stand at the curb a few houses below the Hargreave home.,The men got out.,The watcher ran up.,"""He is still inside,"" he whispered.","""Good!",Spread out.,"If any one leaves that house, catch him.","If he runs too fast, shoot.","We can beat the police.""","The man obeyed, and the watcher ran back to his post.",He was desperately hoping the affair would terminate to-night.,He was growing weary of this eternal vigilance; and it was only his fear of the man known as the boss that kept him at his post.,"He wanted a night to carouse in, to be with the boys.",The man for whom they were lying in wait was seen presently to creep cautiously round the side of the house.,He hugged a corner and paused.,They could see the dim outline of his body.,The light in the street back of the grounds almost made a silhouette of him.,"By and by, as if assured that the coast was clear, he stole down to the street.","""Halt!""",Instantly the prowler took to his heels.,Two shots rang out.,"The man was seen to stop, stagger, and then go on desperately.","""He's hit!""",By the time the men reached the corner they heard the rumble of a motor.,One dashed back to the car they had left standing at the curb.,"He made quick work of the job, but he was not quick enough.","Still, they gave chase.",They saw the car turn toward the city.,"But, unfortunately for the success of the chase, several automobiles passed, going into town and leaving it.",Checkmate.,Braine was keen enough to-night.,"""He is hit; whether badly or not remains to be seen.",We can find that out.,Drive to the nearest drug store and get a list of hospitals.,"It's a ten to one shot that we land him somewhere among the hospitals.""",But they searched the hospitals in vain.,"None of them had that night received a shooting case, nor had they heard one reported.",The man had been unmistakably hit.,He would not have dared risk the loss of time for a bit of play-acting.,Evidently he had kept his head and sought his lodgings.,To call up doctors would be utter folly; for it would take a week for a thorough combing.,This was the second time the man had got away.,"""Perhaps I'm to blame,"" admitted Braine.","""I should have advised Miles to stalk him and pot him if he got the chance.","There's a master mind working somewhere back of all this, and it's time I woke up to the fact.","But you,"" turning to the auto bandits, ""you men have your instructions.","More than that, you have been given a free rein.","See that you make good, or by the Lord Harry!","I'll break the four of you like pipestems.""","""We haven't had a failure yet,"" spoke up one of the men, more courageous than his companions.","""You are not holding up a bank messenger this trip.",Remember that.,Drive me as far as Columbus Circle.,"Leave me on the side street, between the lights, so I can take off this mask.""",Later Braine sauntered into Pabst's and ordered a light supper.,"This night's work, more than anything else, brought home to him the fact that his luck was changing.",For years he had proceeded with his shady occupations without encountering any memorable failure.,"He moved in the high world, quite unsuspected.","He had written books, given lectures, been made a lion of, all the while laughing in his sleeve at the gullibility of human nature.",But within the last two weeks he had received serious checks.,From now on he must move with the utmost caution.,"Some one was playing his own game, waging warfare unseen.",A battle of wits?,"So be it; but Braine intended to play with rough wits, and he wasn't going to care which way the sword cut.",He hated Stanley Hargreave with all the hatred of his soul; the hatred of a man balked in love.,"And the man was alive, defying him; alive somewhere in this city this very night, with a bullet under his skin.","""Is everything satisfactory, sir?""",he heard the head waiter say.,"""Satisfactory?""",Braine repeated blankly.,"""Yes, sir.","You struck the table as though displeased.""","""Oh!""",Then Braine laughed relievedly.,"""If I struck the table, it was done unconsciously.","I was thinking.""","""Beg pardon, sir.","Anything else, sir?""","""No.","Bring me the check.""","""Your master gives riding lessons?""",The groom who had led the horse back from Hargreave's eyed his questioner rather superciliously.,"""Yes.""",The groom fondled the animal's legs.,"""How much is it?""","""Twenty dollars for a ticket of five rides.",The master is the fashion up here.,"He doesn't cater to any but the best families.""","""Pretty steep.","Who was that young lady riding this morning with your master?""","""That's the girl all the newspapers have been talking about,"" answered the groom importantly.","""Actress?""","""Actress!",I should say not.,"That young woman is the daughter of Stanley Hargreave, the millionaire who was lost at sea.",And it won't be long before she puts her finger in a pie of four or five millions.,"If you want any rides, you'll have to talk it over with the boss.",He may or may not take any more rides.,"You'd probably have to ride in the afternoon, anyhow, as every nag is out in the morning.""","""Where's the most popular road?""","""Toward the park; but Miss Hargreave always goes along the riverside road.","She doesn't like strangers about.""","""Oh, I see.","Well, I'll drop in this afternoon and see your master.",They say that riding is good for a torpid liver.,"Have a cigar?""","""Thanks.""",The groom proceeded into the stables and the affable stranger took himself off.,A free rein; they could work it to suit themselves.,There wasn't the least obstacle in the way.,"On the face of it, it appeared to be the simplest job they had yet undertaken.",To get rid of the riding master in some natural way after he and the girl had started.,It was like falling off a log.,"""Susan,"" said Florence, as she came into breakfast after her exhilarating ride, ""did you hear pistol shots last night?""","""I heard some noise, but I was so sleepy I didn't try to figure out what it was.""","""Did you, Jones?""","""Yes, Miss Florence.",The shots came from the street.,A policeman came running up later and said he saw two automobiles on the run.,But evidently there wasn't anybody hurt.,One has to be careful at night nowadays.,There are pretty bad men abroad.,"Did you enjoy the ride?""","""Very much.","But there were some spots of blood on the walk near the corner.""","""Blood?""",Jones caught the back of a chair to steady himself.,"""Yes.",So some one was hurt.,"Oh, let's leave this place!""",impulsively.,"""Let us go back to Miss Farlow's.","You could find a place in the village, Jones.",But if I stay here much longer in this state of unrest I shall lose faith in everything and everybody.,"Whoever my father's enemies are, they do not lack persistence.","They have made two attempts against my liberty, and sooner or later they will succeed.",I keep looking over my shoulder all the time.,"If I hear a noise I jump.""","""Miss Florence, if I thought it wise, you should be packed off to Miss Farlow's this minute.",But not an hour of the day or night passes without this house being watched.,I seldom see anybody about.,I can only sense the presence of a watcher.,At Miss Farlow's you would be far more like a prisoner than here.,I could not accompany you.,"I am forbidden to desert this house.""","""My father's orders?""",Jones signified neither one way nor the other.,He merely gazed stolidly at the rug.,"""That blood!""","She sprang from her chair, horrified.","""It was his!",He was here last night and they shot him!,"Oh!""","""There, there, Miss Florence!",The man was only slightly wounded.,"He's where they never will look for him.""","Then Jones continued, as with an effort: ""Trust me, Miss Florence.",It would not pay to run away.,The whole affair would be repeated elsewhere.,"We might go to the other end of the world, but it would not serve us in the least.","It is not a question of escape, but of who shall vanquish the other.","There is nothing to do but remain here and fight, fight, fight.","We have put four of them in the Tombs, to say nothing of the gunmen.","That is what we must do--put them in a safe place, one by one, till we reach the master.",Then only may we breathe in safety.,"But if they watch, so do we.","There is never a moment when help is not within reach, no matter where you go.","So long as you do not deceive me, no real harm shall befall you.",Don't cry.,"Be your father's daughter, as I am his servant.""","""I am very unhappy!""",And Florence threw her arms around Susan and laid her head upon her friend's shoulder.,"""Poor child!""","Susan, however, recognized the wisdom of Jones' statements.",They were safest here.,The morning rides continued.,"To the girl, who loved the open, it was glorious fun.","Those mad gallops along the roads, the smell of earth and sea, the tingle in the blood, were the second best moments of the day.",The first?,She invariably blushed when she considered what these first best moments were.,"He was a brave young man, good to look at, witty, and always cheerful.",Why shouldn't she like him?,"Even Jones liked him--Jones, who didn't seem to like anybody.",It did not matter whether he was wise or not; a worldly point of view was farthest from her youthful thoughts.,It was her own affair; her own heart.,"Five days later, as she and the riding master were cantering along the road, enjoying every bit of it, they heard the beat of hoofs behind.",They drew up and turned.,A rider was approaching them at a run.,It was the head groom.,The man stopped his horse in a cloud of dust.,"""Sir, the stables are on fire.""","""Fire?""",All the riding master's savings were invested in the stables.,"The fact that he had solemnly promised never to leave Florence alone, and that he had accepted a generous bonus slipped from his mind at the thought of fire, a terrible word to any horseman.","He wheeled and started off at breakneck speed, his head groom clattering behind him.","Florence naturally wondered which of two courses to pursue: follow them, when she would be perfectly helpless to aid them, or continue the ride and save at least one horse from the terror of seeing flames.",She chose the latter.,But she did not ride with the earlier zest.,She felt depressed.,"She loved horses, and the thought of them dying in those wooden stables was horrifying.","The fire, however, proved to be incipient.",But it was plainly incendiary.,Some one had set fire to the stables with a purpose in view.,Norton recognized this fact almost as soon as the firemen.,He had come this morning with the idea of surprising Florence.,He was going out on horseback to join her.,His spine grew suddenly cold.,A trap!,She had been left alone on the road!,"He ran over to the garage, secured a car, and went humming out toward the river road.","A trap, and only by the sheerest luck had he turned up in time.",Meantime Florence was walking her mount slowly.,For once the scenery passed unobserved.,"She was deeply engrossed with thoughts, some of which were happy and some of which were sad.",If only her father could be with her she would be the happiest girl alive.,She was brought out of her revery by the sight of a man staggering along the road ahead of her.,Finally he plunged upon his face in the road.,"Like the tender-hearted girl she was, she stopped, dismounted, and ran to the fallen man to give him aid.",She suddenly found her wrists clasped in two hands like iron.,"The man rose to his feet, smiling evilly.",She struggled wildly but futilely.,"""Better be sensible,"" he said.","""I am stronger than you are.",And I don't wish to hurt you.,Walk on ahead of me.,It will be utterly useless to scream or cry out.,You can see for yourself that we are in a deserted part of the road.,If you will promise to act sensibly I shan't lay a hand on you.,"Do you see that hut yonder, near the fork in the road?",We'll stop there.,"Now, march!""","[Illustration: ""BETTER BE SENSIBLE,"" HE SAID] She dropped her handkerchief, later her bracelet, and finally her crop, in hope that these slight clues might bring her help.","She knew that Jones would hear of the fire, and, finding that she had not returned with the riding master, would immediately start out in pursuit.","She was beginning to grow very fond of Jones, who never spoke unless spoken to, who was always at hand, faithful and loyal.",From afar came the low rumble of a motor.,She wondered if her captor heard it.,"He did, but his ears tricked him into believing that it came from another direction.","Eventually they arrived at the hut, and Florence was forced to enter.",The man locked the door and waited outside for the automobile which he was expecting.,"He was rather dumfounded when he saw that it was coming from the city, not going toward it.",It was Norton.,The riderless horse told him enough; the handkerchief and bracelet and crop led him straight for the hut.,The man before the hut realized by this time that he had made a mistake.,He attempted to re-enter the hut and prepare to defend it till his companions hove in sight.,"But Florence, recognizing Norton, held the door with all her strength.","The man snarled and turned toward Norton, only to receive a smashing blow on the jaw.",Norton flung open the door.,"""Into the car, Florence!",There's another car coming up the road.,"Hurry!""",It was not a long chase.,"The car of the auto bandits, looking like an ordinary taxicab, was a high-powered machine, and it gained swiftly on Norton's four-cylinder.",The reporter waited grimly.,"""Keep your head down!""",he warned Florence.,"""I'm going to take a pot at their tires when they get within range.",If I miss I'm afraid we'll have trouble.,Under no circumstances attempt to leave this car.,"Here they come!""",He suddenly leaned back and fired.,It was only chance.,The manner in which the cars were lurching made a poor target for a marksman even of the first order.,"Chance directed Norton's first bullet into the right forward tire, which exploded.","Going at sixty-odd miles an hour, they could not stop the car in time to avoid fatality.",The car careened wildly and plunged down the embankment into the river.,"Florence covered her eyes with her hands, and, quite unconscious of what he was doing, Norton put his arms around her.",CHAPTER VIII After the affair of the auto bandits--three of whom were killed--a lull followed.,"If you're a sailor you know what kind of a lull I mean--blue-black clouds down the southwest horizon, the water crinkly, the booms wabbling.","Suddenly a series of ""accidents"" began to happen to Norton.",At first he did not give the matter much thought.,The safe which fell almost at his feet and crashed through the sidewalk merely induced him to believe he was lucky.,"At another time an automobile came furiously around a corner while he was crossing the street, and only amazing agility saved him from bodily hurt.",The car was out of sight when he thought to recall the number.,Then came the jolt in the subway.,Only a desperate grab by one of the guards saved him from being crushed to death.,Even then he thought nothing.,"But when a new box of cigarettes arrived and he tried one and found it strangely perfumed, and, upon further analysis, found it to contain a Javanese narcotic, a slow but sure death, he became wide awake enough.",They were after him.,"He began to walk carefully, to keep in public places as often as he possibly could.","He was not really afraid of death, but he did abhor the thought of its coming up from behind.","Except for the cigarettes they were all ""accidents;"" he could not have proved anything before a jury of his intimate friends.",He never entered an elevator without scrupulous care.,He never passed under coverings over the sidewalks where construction was going on.,"Still, careful as he was, death confronted him once more.",It was his habit to have his coffee and rolls--he rarely ate anything more for his breakfast--set down outside his door every morning.,"The coffee, being in a silver thermos bottle, kept its heat for hours.","When he took the stopper out and poured forth a cup it looked oddly black, discolored.","It is quite probable that had there been no series of ""accidents"" he would have drunk a cup--and died in mortal agony.",It contained bichloride of mercury.,Very quietly he set about to make inquiries.,This was really becoming serious.,In the kitchens clown-stairs nothing could be learned.,The maid had set the thermos bottle before the door at ten-thirty.,Norton had opened the door at one-thirty--three hours after.,The outlook was not the cheerfulest.,"He knew perfectly well why all these things ""happened;"" he had interfered with the plans of the scoundrels who were making every possible move to kidnap Florence Hargreave.",One afternoon he paid Florence a visit.,Of course he told her nothing.,They had become secretly engaged the day after he had rescued her from the auto bandits.,They were secretly engaged because Florence wanted it so.,For once Jones suspected nothing.,Why should he?,He had troubles enough.,"As a matter of fact, Norton was afraid of him in the same sense as a boy is afraid of a policeman.","[Illustration: THEY HAD BECOME SECRETLY ENGAGED] But on this day, when the time came, he accosted the butler and drew him into the pantry.","""Jones, they are after me now.""","""You?","Explain.""",Norton briefly recounted the deliberate attempts against his life.,"""You see, I'm not liar enough to say that I'm not worried.","I am, devilishly worried.",I'm not worth any ransom.,"I'm in the way, and they seem determined to put me out of it.""","""To any other man I would say travel.","But to you I say when you leave your rooms don't go where you first thought you would--that is, some usual haunt.","They'll be everywhere, near your restaurants, your clubs, your office.",You're a methodical young man; become erratic.,"Keep away from here for at least three days, but always call me up by telephone some time during the day.","Never under any circumstance, unless I send for you, come here at night.","Only one man now watches the house during the day, but five are prowling around after dark.",They might have instructions to shoot you on sight.,"I can't spare you just at present, Mr. Norton.","You've been a godsend; and if it seems that sometimes I did not trust you fully it was because I did not care to drag you in too deep.""",Deep?,Norton thought of Florence and smiled inwardly.,Could anybody be in deeper than he was?,"Once it was on the tip of his tongue to confess his love for Florence, but the gravity of Jones' countenance was an obstacle to such move; it did not invite it.","To be sure, Jones had no real authority to say what Florence should or should not do with her heart.","Still, from all points of view, it was better to keep the affair under the rose till there came a more propitious hour in which to make the disclosure.","Love, in the midst of all these alarms!","Sharp, desperate rogues on one side, millions on the other, and yet love could enter the scene serenely, like an actor who had missed his cue and come on too

you know of their existence only by the bleached bones of them, strewn along the coast.","You who crave adventures on high seas, you purchase a ticket, a steamer chair, and a couple of popular novels, go on board to the blare of a very indifferent brass band, and believe you are adventuring; when, as a matter of fact, you are about to spend a dull week or a fortnight on a water hotel, where the most exciting thing is the bugle's call to meals or the discovery of a card sharp in the smoking-room.","Take a real ship, go as supercargo, to the South Seas; take the side streets of the ocean, and learn what it can do with hurricanes, typhoons, blistering calms, and men's souls.",There will be adventure enough then.,"If you are a weakling, either you are made strong, or you die.","An honest ship, but run down at the heel, rode at anchor in the sound, a fourth-rater of the hooker breed; that is, her principal line of business was hauling barges up and down the coast.","When she could not pick up enough barges to make it pay, why she'd go gallivanting down to Cuba for bales of tobacco or even to the Bermudas for the heaven-smelling onion.",To-day she was an onion ship; which precludes any idea of adventure.,"She was about four thousand tons, and her engines were sternward and not amidship.","She carried two masts and a half-dozen hoist booms, and the only visible sign of anything new on her was her bowsprit.",This was new doubtless because she had poked her nose too far into her last slip.,Her crew was orderly and tractable.,"There were shore drunks, to be sure, because they were sailors; but they were at work.","They moved about briskly, for they were on the point of sailing for the Bahamas--perhaps for more onions.","Presently the windlass creaked and shrilled, and the blobby links, much in need of tar paint, red as fish gills, clattered down into the bow.","Sometimes they painted the chain as it came over; but paint was costly, and this was done only when the anchor threatened to stay on the bottom.","There was a sailor among this crew, and he went by the name of Steve Blossom; and he was one of his kind.","A grimy dime novel protruded rakishly from his hip pocket, and his right cheek was swollen as with the toothache, due, probably, to a generous ""chaw"" of Seaman's Delight.","He was a real tobacco chewer, for he rarely spat.","He was as peaceful as a backwater bay in summer; non-argumentative and passive, he stood his watch in fair weather and foul.",No one gave the anchor any more attention after it came to rest.,The great city over the way was fairy-like in its haziness and softened lines.,"It was the poetry of angles, of shafts and spars of stone;

simply, they did not splice any more effectually than cotton rope and hemp splice.",Sailors are moody and superstitious; at least they generally are on hookers of the _Captain Manners_ breed.,Steve was superstitious and Jim Dunkers was moody and had no thumb on his left hand.,Steve hated the sight of that red nubbin.,"He was quite certain that it had been a whole thumb once, on the way to gouge out somebody's eye, and had inadvertently connected with somebody's teeth.",Spanish doubloons and pearls and diamonds and rubies!,"It was mighty hard not to say these words out loud, too;

and the moment a man has money he has troubles; there is always some one who wants to take it away from you.,"His bunk was on the port side, and there was plenty of hiding space between the iron plates and the wooden partition.","He intended to loosen three or four planks, and then when the time came, slip the box behind them.","Some time during the morning the forecastle would be empty, and then would be his time.",But he suffered the agonies of damnation during the four-hours' watch.,Supposing some fool should go rummaging about his bunk and discover the box?,Suppose ...,But he dared not suppose.,There was nothing to do but wait.,If he created any curiosity on the part of his mates he was lost.,"He would have to divide with them all, from the captain down to the cook's boy.",It was a heart-rending thought.,"From being the most open and frank man aboard, he became the most cunning.","From being a man without enemies, he saw an enemy even in his shadow.",At four o'clock he turned in and slept like a log.,In the morning he found his opportunity.,For half an hour the forecastle was empty of all save himself.,"Feverishly he pried back the boards, found the brace beam, and gently laid the box there.",It was a mighty curious-looking box.,"Once he had stoked up the Chinese coast from the Philippines, and he judged it to be Chinese in origin.",He tried to pry open the cover and feast his eyes upon the treasure; but under the leather and ivory and mother of pearl was impervious steel.,It would take an ax or a crowbar to stir that lid.,He sighed.,"He replaced the boards, and became to all appearances his stolid self again.","But all the way down to the Bahamas he was moody, and when he answered any questions it was with words spoken testily and jerkily.","""I know whut's th' matter,"" said Dunkers.","""He's in love.""","""Shut your mouth!""","""Didn't I tell yuh?""","laughed the tantalizer, dancing toward the companion way.","""Steve's in love, 'r he didn't git drunk enough on shore t' satisfy his whale's belly!""",A boot thudded spitefully against the door jamb.,"""You fellahs let me alone, 'r I'll bash in a couple o' heads!""","""Oh, yuh will, will yuh?""",cried Dunkers from the deck.,"""If yuh want a little exercise, yuh can begin on me, yuh moonsick swab!","Whut's th' matter with yuh, anyhow?",Where'd yuh git this grouch?,Whut've we done t' yuh?,"Huh?""","""You keep out o' my way, that's all.","I'm mindin' my watches, an' don't ask no odds of you duffers.",What if I have a grouch?,Is it any o' your business?,All right.,"When we step ashore at th' Bahamas, Mister Jim Dunkers, I'll tear the ropes out o' your pulley blocks.","But till we git there, you t' th' upper bunk an' me t' mine.""","""Leave th' ol' grouch alone, Jim.",Th' mate won't stand for no scrappin' aboard.,We'll have th' thing done right in th' custom sheds.,"We'll have a finish fight, Queensberry rules, an' may th' best man win.""","""I'm willin',"" said Jim.","""So'm I,"" agreed Steve.",But his intentions were not honorable.,He proposed to desert before any fight took place.,Not that he was physically afraid;

his disputes could be settled only in one manner, by his calloused fists.","When the old mudhook (and some day Steve was going to buy it and hang it over the entrance to the Gilson House) slithered down into the smiling waters of the bay, Steve concluded that discretion was the better part of valor.",He would steal ashore on the quarantine tug which lay alongside.,"He was willing to fight under ordinary circumstances, but he must get his treasure in safety first.",They could call him a welcher if they wanted to;

most valuable asset.","He was furious, not only at the maid, who, he realized, was virtually helpless, but at his own negligence.",In the midst of his violent harangue the bell sounded.,In his bones he knew what was going to be found there.,It was a letter on the back of which was drawn the fatal black mask.,"With shaking fingers he tore open the envelope and read the contents: ""Florence is now in our power.",Only the surrender of the million will save her.,Our agent will call in an hour for an answer.,"THE BLACK HUNDRED.""","As a matter of fact, they had wanted Jones almost as badly as Florence, but her desire for a book--some popular story of the day--had saved him from the net.",The letter had been written against this possibility.,"Jones became cool, now that he knew just what to face.",The Queen Hotel meant nothing.,Florence would not be taken there.,He called up Norton.,"It took all the butler's patience, however, as it required seven different calls to locate the reporter.",Meantime the taxicab containing Florence and Susan spun madly toward the water front.,Here the two were separated by an effective threat.,Florence recognized the man Vroon and knew that to plead for mercy would be a waste of time.,She permitted herself to be led to a waiting launch.,Always when she disobeyed Jones something like this happened.,"But this time they had cunningly struck at her heart, and all thought of her personal safety became as nothing.",For the present she knew that she was in no actual physical danger.,She was merely to be held as a hostage.,Would Susan have mentality enough to tell Jones where the taxicab had stopped?,She doubted.,"In an emergency Susan had proved herself a nonentity, a bundle of hysterical thrills.","As a matter of fact, for once Florence's deductions were happily wrong.","When the chauffeur peremptorily deposited Susan on the lonely country road, several miles from home, she ran hot-foot to the nearest telephone and sent a very concise message home.","Susan was becoming acclimated to this strange, exciting existence.","Norton arrived in due time, and he and Jones were mapping out a plan when Susan's message came.","[Illustration: THEY WERE MAPPING OUT A PLAN WHEN SUSAN'S MESSAGE CAME] ""Good girl!""",said Jones.,"""She's learning.","Can you handle this alone, Norton?","They want me out of the house

morosely.","""We'll put all the questions we wish when we're at our destination.""",And he nodded significantly toward the ships riding at anchor.,Florence felt her heart sink in spite of her abundant courage.,Were they going to take her to sea again?,"She had acquired a horror of the sea, so big, so terrible, so strong.",She had had an experience with its sullen power.,They had gone about four miles down when she looked back longingly toward shore.,Something white seemed to be spinning over the water far behind.,At first she could not discern what it was.,As she watched it it grew and grew.,It finally emerged from the illusion of a gigantic bird into the actuality of an every-day hydroplane.,Her heart gave a great bound.,This flying machine was coming directly toward the launch; it did not deviate a hair's breadth from the line.,"Fortunately the men were looking toward the huge freighter a quarter of a mile farther on, and from their talk it was evident that the freighter was to

for us!""",Vroon stared under his palm.,It was not credible that pursuit had taken place so quickly.,To test yonder man-bird he abruptly changed the course of the launch.,The hydroplane veered its course to suit.,Florence heard her name called faintly.,"One of the men drew his revolver, but Vroon knocked it out of his hand.","""There's the police boat, you fool!""","""Jump!""",a voice called to Florence.,She flung herself into the water without the slightest hesitation.,All this came about something after this fashion.,When Norton arrived at the foot of Corey Street a boatman informed him

away.,Norton had not served twelve years as a metropolitan newspaper man for nothing.,He approached the mechanics who were puttering about the machine.,"""How about twenty apiece?""",he began.,"""For what?""",the men asked.,"""For sending that paddle around a few times.""","""Get into that seat, but don't touch any of those levers,"" one of them warned.","""Twenty is twenty, Jack, and the boss is

and it is needless to say that some of the million went with them, but there was no mystery about it!","THE END Harold MacGrath A Sketch of the Author at Work and at Play Harold MacGrath, author of more than a dozen best sellers, the book of an operetta, and short stories without number, is a native of Syracuse, N. Y., having been born in that city on September 4, 1871, and lived there ever since, except when he is out circling the globe or in Gotham looking things over.","Mr. MacGrath was a journalist before he essayed the higher form of literature that sells on a royalty basis, instead of by the yard, and he claims that he owes his start in ""romancing"" to a physical defect.","Mr. MacGrath is partially deaf and while serving as a newspaper reporter he heard only about half of what was said to him, and had to ""make up"" the other half himself.","Thus, his imagination was given quite a course in physical culture before its owner's conscience began to prick him.","""Why not do the thing right?""",MacGrath asked himself.,"""I don't knew,"" he replied.","""Let's try it,"" he suggested.","""All right,"" he answered.","And he quit the newspaper game and started a novel, ""Arms and the Woman,"" which appeared in 1890.","This was followed by many good sellers, the speed limit of the author being three books some years.",Next to being a novelist MacGrath is a globe-trotter.,He has been in every nook and corner on the face of the globe where white man dares to go and can get there without swimming or flying.,"As a result, he has obtained the inspirations for most of his novels while amid the fascinating surroundings in some Asiatic harbor town, while traveling down the Rhine, or while listening to strains of Viennese music in some little out-of-the-way cafe along the Danube.","He is a genius in pen picturing and can impart the color, the life, the action of real life into his pages in a manner that is bound to attract.",He is fond of tennis and out-of-door sports.,He likes boxing and is one of the best amateur pool and billiard players in the country.,"He has friends in almost every large city in the world and has met more ""crowned heads"" than any other author, perhaps, outside of Hallie Erminie Rives, wife of Post Wheeler, the versatile secretary of the American Embassy at Tokio.","As a collector and connoisseur, Mr. MacGrath has a wide reputation, his especial hobby being Turkish rugs and antique jewelry, of which he has a wonderful collection.","Another of his hobbies is horses, and although he owns only one himself, he will never pass a good looking horse by without stopping to pat it.","He even carries lump sugar in his pocket and takes great delight in feeding it to the horses of the mounted officers in New York, many of whom (the officers) know him.",His method of working up his stories is unique.,"According to his own statement, he first ""thinks out"" the start of his story, carrying his idea through what develops into the first few chapters of the book.","Then he drops the thread of thought and starts again, but this time at the end, and figures out how he will dispose of his characters and how best the story should end.","This accomplished, he sits down to his typewriter and ""goes to work.""","While writing, he often strikes on good ideas to be incorporated in parts already considered.","Immediately he jots down his idea on the back of an envelope or a scrap of paper and inserts the note among the pages of his manuscript just where it belongs After completing his first draft, he goes back over the entire manuscript, making corrections here and there and additions.",He then sits down to sum the whole story up in his mind and by this process is able to pick out the flaws.,"His second draft, therefore, is quite a finished product.","He makes the final draft of his manuscript himself, as he has found that he often strikes upon improvements at the eleventh hour that go far to better his stories.","If he turned the work of making the final draft over to a stenographer, this last chance would be lost.",He is one of the few modern writers who does not have to try to be funny.,It is natural with him to amuse.,"Those interested in the chronological order of his stories will find them as follows: In 1901 he published his second book, ""The Puppet Crown.""","""The Grey Cloak"" followed in 1903, and by the time it appeared, most of the readers of fiction had acquired the MacGrath habit and were on the lookout for the next dose of his delightful literary stimulant that chased the ""blues.""","Then came the story which established MacGrath's reputation, ""The Man on the Box,"" which appeared in 1904 and is still one of the best sellers in popular editions.",In 1905 MacGrath put on some extra speed.,He worked a double shift in his brain mill and the result was that before the dawn of the next New Year's Day he had three more successful books to his credit.,"They were ""The Princess Elopes,"" a novelette; ""Enchantment,"" a book of short stories, and ""Hearts and Masks,"" a novel that dealt with entanglements developing at a mask ball.","In the same year he wrote ""Half a Rogue,"" another highly popular story.","In 1906 he turned out ""The Watteau Shepherdess,"" an operetta.","These two productions were followed by ""The Best Man"" in 1907; ""The Enchanted Hat"" and ""The Lure of the Mask"" in 1908.","""The Goose Girl"" was MacGrath's next novel, and went far to uphold his reputation.","""A Splendid Hazard"" and ""The Carpet of Bagdad"" followed within the space of little more than a year.","Next ""The Place of Honeymoons"" was published, then ""Parrot & Co.,"" ""Deuces Wild,"" ""Pidgin Island,"" ""The Adventures of Kathlyn,"" and ""Voice in the Fog.""","The ""purpose novel,"" as that term is generally understood, finds but little sympathy at the hands of Harold MacGrath.",Yet he has a definite purpose of his own.,It is to amuse.,"""The one definite idea I have in mind in writing stories,"" he says, ""is to afford an agreeable, pleasant hour or two to my readers.","I wish to amuse them, to make them wish that they, too, might have lived as this or that hero, in this or that land, probable or improbable.","I prefer sunshine, mirth, buoyancy, and I believe most readers prefer the same.","Grown-up people never wholly lose their love of fairy tales; and grown up fairy tales have been the scheme of most of my novels.""",Could an author have a better purpose than this?,Could he serve men to better advantage than by lightening the burden they are destined to carry through life by allowing their minds to dwell in pleasant places and to rejoice with the people of a make-believe world?,"""I usually begin a story as a dramatist begins a play--with the end,"" says MacGrath.","""The characters work out the plot themselves; I have very little to do with it after they have started.""","""The structure of a plot must naturally be foremost; for, after all is said and done, the story's the thing.","I never outline a plot; I carry the main thread in my head until I am ready to put it on paper, and after it assumes body on paper, it has many devious twists and turns of which I have no prior idea.""","""I write whenever I feel like it, for when I am in the mood I do better work.",I never force myself to do so much work each day.,"There are days when it is impossible to write one hundred words; again, I have written as many as seven thousand words a day.",Obstacles?,There are altogether too many to demonstrate.,"A character that doesn't ""balk"" never fails to be uninteresting.","I have always tried to place human people in absurd or unique situations and to let them extricate themselves as you or I, if so placed.","""The anatomy of a motif for a story is a complex thing, but of a practical joke, 'The Man on the Box' was evolved.",A young man disguised as a coachman drove his sister and her friend to a ball one night.,"This happened in my native town, Syracuse, and it amused me greatly when critics said that the exploit was highly improbable.",Out of the Italian state and church marriage came the plot of 'The Lure of the Mask.',The most trivial thing sometimes will suggest a plot.,I found the ten of hearts one night on the sidewalk.,It became the motif of 'Hearts and Masks.',"Once, in Indianapolis, I chanced to see an Italian selling plaster images.",It gave me a starting point for 'A Splendid Hazard.',Walking down Broadway one day I stopped to look in a window where oriental rugs were being advertised.,"When I turned away the seed germ for my latest book, 'The Carpet from Bagdad,' was in my mind.""",Mr. MacGrath is an enthusiastic fisherman.,"He goes to Cape Vincent, Lake Ontario, every summer, when he isn't ambling in China, or India, or Africa.","He believes that the best bass grounds in the world are within a radius of twenty miles from Cape Vincent, which is really in the head of the St. Lawrence River.","A friend undertook to convince him that there were other places, so MacGrath consented to accompany him to Canada.","They arrived at sunset, and the host extemporized over the glories of the setting sun.","""Ever see anything to beat that, Mac?""","""Fine!""",On the following morning they went out for bass.,At four o'clock in the afternoon they had caught exactly one.,The host again rhapsodized over the sunset.,The second day they caught no bass at all.,On their way back to the hotel the host was silent.,"As they came up to the landing, MacGrath touched his host on the shoulder.","""There's your darned sunset, Jim!""","End of Project Gutenberg's The Million

""I shall always come back to see you.""","She meant it, poor child; but how was she to know the terrors which lay beyond the horizon!","The house of Stanley Hargreave, in Riverdale, was the house of no ordinary rich man.","Outside it was simple enough, but within you learned what kind of a man Hargreave was.","There were rare Ispahans and Saruks on the floors and tapestries on the walls, and here and there a fine painting.",The library itself represented a fortune.,Money had been laid out lavishly but never wastefully.,"It was the home of a scholar, a dreamer, a wide traveler.","In the library stood the master of the house, idly fingering some papers which lay on the study table.","He shrugged at some unpleasant thought, settled his overcoat about his shoulders, took up his hat, and walked from the room, frowning slightly.","The butler, who also acted in the capacity of valet and was always within call when his master was about, stepped swiftly to the hall door and opened it.","""I may be out late, Jones,"" said Hargreave.","""Yes, sir.""","Hargreave stared into his face keenly, as if trying to pierce the grave face to learn what was going on behind it.","""How long have you been with me?""","""Fourteen years, sir.""","""Some day I shall need you.""","""My life has always been at your disposal, sir, since that night you rescued me.""","""Well, I haven't the least doubt that when I ask you will give.""","""Without question, sir.","It was always so understood.""","Hargreave's glance sought the mirror, then the smileless face of his man.","He laughed, but the sound conveyed no sense of mirth; then he turned and went down the steps slowly, like a man burdened with some thought which was not altogether to his liking.","He had sent an order for his car, but had immediately countermanded it.","He would walk till he grew tired, hail a taxicab, and take a run up and down Broadway.",The wonderful illumination might prove diverting.,For eighteen years nearly; and now it was as natural for him to throw a glance over his shoulder whenever he left the house as it was for him to breathe.,"The average man would have grown careless during all these years; but Hargreave was not an average man; he was, rather, an extraordinary individual.","It was his life in exchange for eternal vigilance, and he knew and accepted the fact.",Half an hour later he got into a taxicab and directed the man to drive down-town as far as Twenty-third Street and back to Columbus circle.,"The bewildering display of lights, however, in nowise served to lift the sense of oppression that had weighed upon him all day.",South of Forty-second Street he dismissed the taxicab and stared undecidedly at the brilliant sign of a famous restaurant.,He was neither hungry nor thirsty; but there would be strange faces to study and music.,It was an odd whim.,He had not entered a Broadway restaurant in all these years.,He was unknown.,He belonged to no clubs.,Two months was the longest time he had ever remained in New York since the disposal of his old home in Madison Avenue and his resignation from his clubs.,"This once, then, he would break the law he had written down for himself.",Boldly he entered the restaurant.,"Some time before Hargreave surrendered to the restless spirit of rebellion, bitterly to repent for it later, there came into this restaurant a man and a woman.","They were both evidently well known, for the head waiter was obsequious and hurried them over to the best table he had left and took the order himself.","The man possessed a keen, intelligent face.","You might have marked him for a successful lawyer, for there was an earnestness about his expression which precluded a life of idleness.",His age might have been anywhere between forty and fifty.,The shoulders were broad and the hands which lay clasped upon the table were slim but muscular.,"Indeed, everything about him suggested hidden strength and vitality.","His companion was small, handsome, and animated.",Her frequent gestures and mutable eyebrows betrayed her foreign birth.,Her age was a matter of importance to no one but herself.,"[Illustration: YOU MIGHT HAVE MARKED HIM FOR A SUCCESSFUL LAWYER] They were at coffee when she said: ""There's a young man coming toward us.","He is looking at you.""",The man turned.,Instantly his face lighted up with a friendly smile of recognition.,"""Who is it?""",she asked.,"""A chap worth knowing;

the eye became cold.,Over the smoke of his cigarette he was looking into the wall mirror.,A man had passed behind him and sat down at the next table.,"Still gazing into the mirror, Braine saw Norton wave his hand; saw also the open wonder on the reporter's pleasant face.","""Who is your friend, Norton?""","Braine asked indifferently, his head still unturned.","""Stanley Hargreave.",Met him in Hongkong when I was sent over to handle a part of the revolution.,War correspondence stuff.,First time I ever ran across him on Broadway at night.,We've since had some powwows over some rare books.,"Queer old cock;

two, then one, then three, and again one.",The door opened and he slipped inside.,"Round a table sat several men, also masked.",They were all tried and trusted rogues; but not one of them knew what Braine looked like.,"He alone remained unknown save to the man designated as the chief, who was only Braine's lieutenant.","The mask was the insignia of the Black Hundred, an organization with all the ramifications of the Camorra without their abiding stupidity.","From the assassination of a king, down to the robbery of a country post-office, nothing was too great or too small for their nets.",Their god dwells in the hearts of all men and is called greed.,"The ordinary business over, the chief dismissed the men, and he and Braine alone remained.","""Vroon, I have found him,"" said Braine.","""There are but few: which one?""","""Eighteen years ago, in St.","Petersburg.""","""I remember.",The millionaire's son.,"Did he recognize you?""","""I don't know.",Probably he did.,But he always had good nerves.,He is being followed at this moment.,We shall strike quick;

along?""","""In his capacity of butler only.""",Norton smiled.,"""Well, I'll take a jaunt out there myself.","You are sure of the location?""","""Yes.""","""Well, good-by.","I'll go as a waiter, since they wouldn't invite me.","I'm one of the best little waiters you ever heard of; and all things come to him who waits.""","What a pleasant, affable young man he was!",thought Susan as she watched him jump into the car and go flying up the street.,Jones was a good deal surprised when Norton turned up at the old Chilton manor.,"""What made you come here dressed like this?""",the butler demanded.,"""I'm a suspicious duffer; maybe that's the reason.""","""Do you know anything?""","""Well, no; I can't say that I do.","But, hang it, I just had to come out here.""","""Maybe it's just as well you did,"" said Jones moodily.","""I know this place.","The housekeeper used to be my nurse, and if she is still on the job she may be of service to us.","You don't think they'll question or recognize me?""","""Hardly.",I'll put in a word for you.,"I'll say I sent for you, not knowing if we had enough servants to take care of the luncheon.""","""And now I'll go and hunt up Meg.""","Sure enough, his old nurse was still in charge of the house; and when her ""baby"" disclosed his identity she all but fell upon his neck.","""But what are you doing here, dressed up as a waiter?""","""It's a little secret, Meg.","I wasn't invited, and the truth is I'm very desperately in love with the young lady in whose honor this coaching party is being given.","And ... maybe she's in danger.""","""Danger?","What about?""","""The Lord only knows.",But show me about the house.,I've not been here in so long I've forgotten the run of it.,I remember one room with the secret panel and another with a painting that turned.,"Have they changed them?""","""No; it is just the same here as it used to be.","Come along and I'll show you.""","Norton inspected the rooms carefully, stowing away in his mind every detail.",He might be worrying about nothing; but so many strange things had happened that it was better to be on the side of caution than on the side of carelessness.,He left the house and ran across Jones carrying a basket of wine.,"""Here, Norton; take this to the party.","I want to reconnoiter.""","""All right, m'lud!","Say, Jones, how much do you think I'd earn at this job?""",comically.,"""Get along with you, Mr. Norton.","It may be the time to laugh, and then it may not.""","""I'm going back into the house and hide behind a secret panel.",I've got my revolver.,You go to the stables and take a try at my car; see if she works smoothly.,We may have to do some hiking.,"Where is the countess in this?""","""Leave that to me, Mr. Norton,"" said the butler with his grim smile.","""Be off; they are moving back toward the house.""","So Norton carried the basket around to the lawn, where it was taken from his hands by the regular servant.","He sighed as he saw Florence, laughing and chatting with a man who was a stranger and whom he heard addressed as count.","Some friend of the countess, no doubt.",Where was all this tangle going to end?,He wished he knew.,And what a yarn he was going to write some day!,It would read like one of Gaboriau's tales.,"He turned away to wander idly about the grounds, when beyond a clump of cedars he saw three or four men conversing slowly.","He got as near as possible, for when three or four men put their heads together and whisper animatedly, it usually means a poker game or something worse.","He caught a phrase or two as they came down the wind, and then he knew that the vague suspicion that had brought him out here had been set in motion by fate.","He heard ""Florence"" and ""the old drawing room;"" and that was enough.",He scurried about for Jones.,"It was pure luck that he had had old Meg show him through the house, otherwise he would have forgotten all about the secret panel in the wall and the painting.",Jones shrugged resignedly.,Were these men of the countess' party?,Norton couldn't say.,[Illustration: THE SECRET PANEL] Norton made his hiding place in safety; and by and by he could hear the guests moving about in the room.,Then all sounds ceased for a while.,A door closed sharply.,"""No; here you must stay, young lady,"" said a man's voice.","""What do you mean, sir?""",demanded the beloved voice.,"""It means that no one will return to this room and that you will not be missed until it is too late.""","The sound of voices stopped abruptly, and something like scuffling ensued.",Later Norton heard the back of a chair strike the panel and some one sat heavily upon it.,He waited perhaps five minutes; then he gently slid back the panel.,Florence sat bound and gagged under his very eyes.,It was but the work of a moment to liberate her.,"""It is I, Jim.",Do not speak or make the least noise.,"Follow me.""","Greatly astonished, Florence obeyed; and the panel slipped back into place.",The room behind the secret panel had barred windows.,To Florence it appeared to be a real prison.,"""How did you get here?""",she asked breathlessly.,"""Something told me to follow you.","And something is always going to tell me to follow you, Florence.""",She pressed his hand.,It was to her as if one of those book heroes had stepped out of a book; only book heroes always had tremendous fortunes and did not have to work for a living.,"Oddly enough, she was not afraid.","""Who was the man?""",he asked.,"""The Count Norfeldt.","Some one has imposed upon the countess.""","""Do you think so?""",with a strange look in his eyes.,"""What do you mean?""","""Nothing just now.",The idea is to get out of here just as quickly as we can.,"See this painting?""",He touched a spot in the wall and the painting slowly swung out like a door.,"""Come; we make our escape to the side lawn from here.""",At the stable they were confronted with the knowledge that Norton's car was out of commission; Jones could do nothing with it.,"Then Norton suggested that he make an effort to commandeer the limousine of the countess; but there were men about, so the limousine was out of the question.","""Horses!""",whispered Jones.,"""There are several saddle horses, already saddled.","How about these people, the owners?""","""Oh, they are beyond reproach.",They have doubtless been imposed upon.,But let us get aboard first.,There will be time to talk later.,"I'll have to do some explaining, taking these nags off like this.",We won't have to ride out in front where the picnickers are.,"There's a lane back of the stable, and a slight detour brings us back into the main road.""",The three mounted and clattered away.,To Florence it had the air of a prank.,She was beginning to have such confidence in these two inventive men that she felt as if she was never going to be afraid any more.,When the Countess Olga saw the three horses it was an effort not to fly into a rage.,"But secretly she warned her people, who presently gave chase in the limousine, while she prattled and jested and laughed with her company, who were quite unaware that a drama was being enacted right under their very noses.","The countess, while she acted superbly, tore her handkerchief into shreds.","There was something sinister in the way all their plans fell through at the very moment of consummation; and that night she determined to ask Braine to withdraw from this warfare, which gradually decimated their numbers without getting anywhere toward the goal.",Jones shouted that the limousine was tearing down the road.,Something must be done to stop it.,"He suggested that he drop behind, leave his horse, and take a chance at potting a tire from the shrubbery at the roadside.","""Keep going.","Don't stop, Norton, till you are back in town.","I'll manage to take good care of myself.""",CHAPTER VII When all three finally met at the Hargreave home Florence suddenly took Jones by the shoulders and kissed him lightly on the cheek.,"Jones started back, pale and disturbed.",Norton laughed.,"He did not feel the slightest twinge of jealousy, but he was eaten up with envy, as the old wives say.","""You are wondering if I suspect the Countess Perigoff?""",said Jones.,"""I am.""",This man Jones was developing into a very remarkable character.,"The reporter found himself side glancing at the thin, keen face of this resourceful butler.",The lobe of the man's left ear came within range.,"Norton reached for a cigarette, but his hands shook as he lit it.",There was a peculiar little scar in the center of the lobe.,"""Well,"" said Jones, ""I can find no evidence that she has been concerned in any of these affairs.""","""You are suspicious?""","""Of everybody,"" looking boldly into the reporter's eyes.","""Of me?""",smiling.,"""Even of myself sometimes.""",Conversation dropped entirely after this declaration.,"""You're a taciturn sort of chap.""","""Am I?""","""You are.","But an agreement is an agreement, and while I'd like to print this story, I'll not.","We newspaper men seldom break our word.""",Jones held out his hand.,"""Sometimes I wish I'd started life right,"" said the reporter gloomily.","""A newspaper man is generally improvident.",He never looks ahead for to-morrow.,"What with my special articles to the magazines, I earn between four and five thousand the year; and I've never been able to save a cent.""","""Perhaps you've never really tried,"" replied Jones, with a glance at his companion.","It was a good face, strong in outline; a little careworn, perhaps, but free from any indications of dissipation.","""If I had begun life as you did, I'd have made real and solid use of the great men I met.","I'd have made financiers help me to invest my earnings, or savings, little as they might be.","And to-day I'd be living on the income.""","""You never can tell.","Perhaps a woman might have made you think of those things; but if you had remained unattached up to thirty-one, as I have, the thought of saving might never have entered your head.","A man in my present condition, financially, has no right to think of matrimony.""","""It might be the saving of you if you met and married the right woman.""","""But the right woman might be heiress to millions.","And a poor devil like me could not marry a girl with money and hang on to his self-respect.""","""True.","But there are always exceptions to all rules in life, except those regarding health.","A healthy man is a normal man, and a normal man has no right to remain single.","You proved yourself a man this afternoon, considering that you did not know I occupied the wheel seat.","Come to think it over, you really saved the day.",You gave me the opportunity of steering straight for the police station.,"Well, good-by.""","""Queer duck!""","mused the reporter as, after telephoning, he headed for his office.","Queer duck, indeed!",What a game it was going to be!,And this man Jones was playing it like a master.,It did not matter that some one else laid down the rules; it was the way in which they were interpreted.,Braine heard of the failure.,The Black Hundred was finding its stock far below par value.,"Four valuable men locked up in the Tombs awaiting trial, to say nothing of the seven gunmen gathered in at the old warehouse.","Braine began to suspect that his failures were less due to chance than to calculation, that at last he had encountered a mind which anticipated his every move.",He would have recognized this fact earlier had it not been that revenge had temporarily blinded him.,The spirit of revenge never makes for mental clarity.,There was a meeting that night of the Black Hundred.,"Four men were told off, and they drew their chairs up to Vroon's table for instructions.",Braine sat at Vroon's elbow.,These four men composed the most dangerous quartet in New York City.,They were as daring as they were desperate.,They were the men who held up bank messengers and got away with thousands.,They had learned to swoop down upon their victims as the hawk swoops down upon the heron.,"The newspapers referred to them as the ""auto bandits,"" and the men took a deal of pride in the furore they had created.",[Illustration: FOUR MEN WERE TOLD OFF] Vroon went over the Hargreave case minutely; he left no detail unexplained.,"Bluntly and frankly, the daughter of Stanley Hargreave must be caught and turned over to the care of the Black Hundred.",It must be quick action.,Four valuable members were in the Tombs.,They might or might not weaken under pressure.,For the first time in its American career the organization stood facing actual peril; and its one possible chance of salvation lay in the fact that no one's face was known to his neighbor.,"He, Vroon, and the boss alone knew who and what each man was.","But the plans, the ramifications of the organization might become public property; and that would mean an end to an exceedingly profitable business.",The daughter of Hargreave rode horseback early every morning.,She sought the country road.,She was invariably attended by the riding master of a school near by.,"""You four will make your own plans.""","""If she should be injured?""","""Avoid it if possible.""","""We have a free hand?""","""Absolutely.""","""We risk a bad fall from her horse if it's a spirited one.""","""Pretend a breakdown in the road,"" interpolated Braine.","""As they approach, draw and order them to dismount.","That method will prevent any accident.""","""We'll plan it somehow.","It looks easy.""","""Nothing is easy where that girl is concerned.","A thousand eyes seem to be watching her slightest move.""","""We shan't leave anything to chance.","How many days will you give us?""","""Seven.","A failure, mind you, will prove unhealthy to all concerned,"" with a menace which made the four stir uneasily.",The telephone rang.,Braine reached for the receiver.,"""A man just entered the Hargreave house at the rear.","Come at once,"" was the message.","""Is your car outside?""",Braine asked.,"""We are never without it.""","""Then let us be off.","No one will stop us for speeding on a side street.""",Fourteen minutes by the clock brought the car to a stand at the curb a few houses below the Hargreave home.,The men got out.,The watcher ran up.,"""He is still inside,"" he whispered.","""Good!",Spread out.,"If any one leaves that house, catch him.","If he runs too fast, shoot.","We can beat the police.""","The man obeyed, and the watcher ran back to his post.",He was desperately hoping the affair would terminate to-night.,He was growing weary of this eternal vigilance; and it was only his fear of the man known as the boss that kept him at his post.,"He wanted a night to carouse in, to be with the boys.",The man for whom they were lying in wait was seen presently to creep cautiously round the side of the house.,He hugged a corner and paused.,They could see the dim outline of his body.,The light in the street back of the grounds almost made a silhouette of him.,"By and by, as if assured that the coast was clear, he stole down to the street.","""Halt!""",Instantly the prowler took to his heels.,Two shots rang out.,"The man was seen to stop, stagger, and then go on desperately.","""He's hit!""",By the time the men reached the corner they heard the rumble of a motor.,One dashed back to the car they had left standing at the curb.,"He made quick work of the job, but he was not quick enough.","Still, they gave chase.",They saw the car turn toward the city.,"But, unfortunately for the success of the chase, several automobiles passed, going into town and leaving it.",Checkmate.,Braine was keen enough to-night.,"""He is hit; whether badly or not remains to be seen.",We can find that out.,Drive to the nearest drug store and get a list of hospitals.,"It's a ten to one shot that we land him somewhere among the hospitals.""",But they searched the hospitals in vain.,"None of them had that night received a shooting case, nor had they heard one reported.",The man had been unmistakably hit.,He would not have dared risk the loss of time for a bit of play-acting.,Evidently he had kept his head and sought his lodgings.,To call up doctors would be utter folly; for it would take a week for a thorough combing.,This was the second time the man had got away.,"""Perhaps I'm to blame,"" admitted Braine.","""I should have advised Miles to stalk him and pot him if he got the chance.","There's a master mind working somewhere back of all this, and it's time I woke up to the fact.","But you,"" turning to the auto bandits, ""you men have your instructions.","More than that, you have been given a free rein.","See that you make good, or by the Lord Harry!","I'll break the four of you like pipestems.""","""We haven't had a failure yet,"" spoke up one of the men, more courageous than his companions.","""You are not holding up a bank messenger this trip.",Remember that.,Drive me as far as Columbus Circle.,"Leave me on the side street, between the lights, so I can take off this mask.""",Later Braine sauntered into Pabst's and ordered a light supper.,"This night's work, more than anything else, brought home to him the fact that his luck was changing.",For years he had proceeded with his shady occupations without encountering any memorable failure.,"He moved in the high world, quite unsuspected.","He had written books, given lectures, been made a lion of, all the while laughing in his sleeve at the gullibility of human nature.",But within the last two weeks he had received serious checks.,From now on he must move with the utmost caution.,"Some one was playing his own game, waging warfare unseen.",A battle of wits?,"So be it; but Braine intended to play with rough wits, and he wasn't going to care which way the sword cut.",He hated Stanley Hargreave with all the hatred of his soul; the hatred of a man balked in love.,"And the man was alive, defying him; alive somewhere in this city this very night, with a bullet under his skin.","""Is everything satisfactory, sir?""",he heard the head waiter say.,"""Satisfactory?""",Braine repeated blankly.,"""Yes, sir.","You struck the table as though displeased.""","""Oh!""",Then Braine laughed relievedly.,"""If I struck the table, it was done unconsciously.","I was thinking.""","""Beg pardon, sir.","Anything else, sir?""","""No.","Bring me the check.""","""Your master gives riding lessons?""",The groom who had led the horse back from Hargreave's eyed his questioner rather superciliously.,"""Yes.""",The groom fondled the animal's legs.,"""How much is it?""","""Twenty dollars for a ticket of five rides.",The master is the fashion up here.,"He doesn't cater to any but the best families.""","""Pretty steep.","Who was that young lady riding this morning with your master?""","""That's the girl all the newspapers have been talking about,"" answered the groom importantly.","""Actress?""","""Actress!",I should say not.,"That young woman is the daughter of Stanley Hargreave, the millionaire who was lost at sea.",And it won't be long before she puts her finger in a pie of four or five millions.,"If you want any rides, you'll have to talk it over with the boss.",He may or may not take any more rides.,"You'd probably have to ride in the afternoon, anyhow, as every nag is out in the morning.""","""Where's the most popular road?""","""Toward the park; but Miss Hargreave always goes along the riverside road.","She doesn't like strangers about.""","""Oh, I see.","Well, I'll drop in this afternoon and see your master.",They say that riding is good for a torpid liver.,"Have a cigar?""","""Thanks.""",The groom proceeded into the stables and the affable stranger took himself off.,A free rein; they could work it to suit themselves.,There wasn't the least obstacle in the way.,"On the face of it, it appeared to be the simplest job they had yet undertaken.",To get rid of the riding master in some natural way after he and the girl had started.,It was like falling off a log.,"""Susan,"" said Florence, as she came into breakfast after her exhilarating ride, ""did you hear pistol shots last night?""","""I heard some noise, but I was so sleepy I didn't try to figure out what it was.""","""Did you, Jones?""","""Yes, Miss Florence.",The shots came from the street.,A policeman came running up later and said he saw two automobiles on the run.,But evidently there wasn't anybody hurt.,One has to be careful at night nowadays.,There are pretty bad men abroad.,"Did you enjoy the ride?""","""Very much.","But there were some spots of blood on the walk near the corner.""","""Blood?""",Jones caught the back of a chair to steady himself.,"""Yes.",So some one was hurt.,"Oh, let's leave this place!""",impulsively.,"""Let us go back to Miss Farlow's.","You could find a place in the village, Jones.",But if I stay here much longer in this state of unrest I shall lose faith in everything and everybody.,"Whoever my father's enemies are, they do not lack persistence.","They have made two attempts against my liberty, and sooner or later they will succeed.",I keep looking over my shoulder all the time.,"If I hear a noise I jump.""","""Miss Florence, if I thought it wise, you should be packed off to Miss Farlow's this minute.",But not an hour of the day or night passes without this house being watched.,I seldom see anybody about.,I can only sense the presence of a watcher.,At Miss Farlow's you would be far more like a prisoner than here.,I could not accompany you.,"I am forbidden to desert this house.""","""My father's orders?""",Jones signified neither one way nor the other.,He merely gazed stolidly at the rug.,"""That blood!""","She sprang from her chair, horrified.","""It was his!",He was here last night and they shot him!,"Oh!""","""There, there, Miss Florence!",The man was only slightly wounded.,"He's where they never will look for him.""","Then Jones continued, as with an effort: ""Trust me, Miss Florence.",It would not pay to run away.,The whole affair would be repeated elsewhere.,"We might go to the other end of the world, but it would not serve us in the least.","It is not a question of escape, but of who shall vanquish the other.","There is nothing to do but remain here and fight, fight, fight.","We have put four of them in the Tombs, to say nothing of the gunmen.","That is what we must do--put them in a safe place, one by one, till we reach the master.",Then only may we breathe in safety.,"But if they watch, so do we.","There is never a moment when help is not within reach, no matter where you go.","So long as you do not deceive me, no real harm shall befall you.",Don't cry.,"Be your father's daughter, as I am his servant.""","""I am very unhappy!""",And Florence threw her arms around Susan and laid her head upon her friend's shoulder.,"""Poor child!""","Susan, however, recognized the wisdom of Jones' statements.",They were safest here.,The morning rides continued.,"To the girl, who loved the open, it was glorious fun.","Those mad gallops along the roads, the smell of earth and sea, the tingle in the blood, were the second best moments of the day.",The first?,She invariably blushed when she considered what these first best moments were.,"He was a brave young man, good to look at, witty, and always cheerful.",Why shouldn't she like him?,"Even Jones liked him--Jones, who didn't seem to like anybody.",It did not matter whether he was wise or not; a worldly point of view was farthest from her youthful thoughts.,It was her own affair; her own heart.,"Five days later, as she and the riding master were cantering along the road, enjoying every bit of it, they heard the beat of hoofs behind.",They drew up and turned.,A rider was approaching them at a run.,It was the head groom.,The man stopped his horse in a cloud of dust.,"""Sir, the stables are on fire.""","""Fire?""",All the riding master's savings were invested in the stables.,"The fact that he had solemnly promised never to leave Florence alone, and that he had accepted a generous bonus slipped from his mind at the thought of fire, a terrible word to any horseman.","He wheeled and started off at breakneck speed, his head groom clattering behind him.","Florence naturally wondered which of two courses to pursue: follow them, when she would be perfectly helpless to aid them, or continue the ride and save at least one horse from the terror of seeing flames.",She chose the latter.,But she did not ride with the earlier zest.,She felt depressed.,"She loved horses, and the thought of them dying in those wooden stables was horrifying.","The fire, however, proved to be incipient.",But it was plainly incendiary.,Some one had set fire to the stables with a purpose in view.,Norton recognized this fact almost as soon as the firemen.,He had come this morning with the idea of surprising Florence.,He was going out on horseback to join her.,His spine grew suddenly cold.,A trap!,She had been left alone on the road!,"He ran over to the garage, secured a car, and went humming out toward the river road.","A trap, and only by the sheerest luck had he turned up in time.",Meantime Florence was walking her mount slowly.,For once the scenery passed unobserved.,"She was deeply engrossed with thoughts, some of which were happy and some of which were sad.",If only her father could be with her she would be the happiest girl alive.,She was brought out of her revery by the sight of a man staggering along the road ahead of her.,Finally he plunged upon his face in the road.,"Like the tender-hearted girl she was, she stopped, dismounted, and ran to the fallen man to give him aid.",She suddenly found her wrists clasped in two hands like iron.,"The man rose to his feet, smiling evilly.",She struggled wildly but futilely.,"""Better be sensible,"" he said.","""I am stronger than you are.",And I don't wish to hurt you.,Walk on ahead of me.,It will be utterly useless to scream or cry out.,You can see for yourself that we are in a deserted part of the road.,If you will promise to act sensibly I shan't lay a hand on you.,"Do you see that hut yonder, near the fork in the road?",We'll stop there.,"Now, march!""","[Illustration: ""BETTER BE SENSIBLE,"" HE SAID] She dropped her handkerchief, later her bracelet, and finally her crop, in hope that these slight clues might bring her help.","She knew that Jones would hear of the fire, and, finding that she had not returned with the riding master, would immediately start out in pursuit.","She was beginning to grow very fond of Jones, who never spoke unless spoken to, who was always at hand, faithful and loyal.",From afar came the low rumble of a motor.,She wondered if her captor heard it.,"He did, but his ears tricked him into believing that it came from another direction.","Eventually they arrived at the hut, and Florence was forced to enter.",The man locked the door and waited outside for the automobile which he was expecting.,"He was rather dumfounded when he saw that it was coming from the city, not going toward it.",It was Norton.,The riderless horse told him enough; the handkerchief and bracelet and crop led him straight for the hut.,The man before the hut realized by this time that he had made a mistake.,He attempted to re-enter the hut and prepare to defend it till his companions hove in sight.,"But Florence, recognizing Norton, held the door with all her strength.","The man snarled and turned toward Norton, only to receive a smashing blow on the jaw.",Norton flung open the door.,"""Into the car, Florence!",There's another car coming up the road.,"Hurry!""",It was not a long chase.,"The car of the auto bandits, looking like an ordinary taxicab, was a high-powered machine, and it gained swiftly on Norton's four-cylinder.",The reporter waited grimly.,"""Keep your head down!""",he warned Florence.,"""I'm going to take a pot at their tires when they get within range.",If I miss I'm afraid we'll have trouble.,Under no circumstances attempt to leave this car.,"Here they come!""",He suddenly leaned back and fired.,It was only chance.,The manner in which the cars were lurching made a poor target for a marksman even of the first order.,"Chance directed Norton's first bullet into the right forward tire, which exploded.","Going at sixty-odd miles an hour, they could not stop the car in time to avoid fatality.",The car careened wildly and plunged down the embankment into the river.,"Florence covered her eyes with her hands, and, quite unconscious of what he was doing, Norton put his arms around her.",CHAPTER VIII After the affair of the auto bandits--three of whom were killed--a lull followed.,"If you're a sailor you know what kind of a lull I mean--blue-black clouds down the southwest horizon, the water crinkly, the booms wabbling.","Suddenly a series of ""accidents"" began to happen to Norton.",At first he did not give the matter much thought.,The safe which fell almost at his feet and crashed through the sidewalk merely induced him to believe he was lucky.,"At another time an automobile came furiously around a corner while he was crossing the street, and only amazing agility saved him from bodily hurt.",The car was out of sight when he thought to recall the number.,Then came the jolt in the subway.,Only a desperate grab by one of the guards saved him from being crushed to death.,Even then he thought nothing.,"But when a new box of cigarettes arrived and he tried one and found it strangely perfumed, and, upon further analysis, found it to contain a Javanese narcotic, a slow but sure death, he became wide awake enough.",They were after him.,"He began to walk carefully, to keep in public places as often as he possibly could.","He was not really afraid of death, but he did abhor the thought of its coming up from behind.","Except for the cigarettes they were all ""accidents;"" he could not have proved anything before a jury of his intimate friends.",He never entered an elevator without scrupulous care.,He never passed under coverings over the sidewalks where construction was going on.,"Still, careful as he was, death confronted him once more.",It was his habit to have his coffee and rolls--he rarely ate anything more for his breakfast--set down outside his door every morning.,"The coffee, being in a silver thermos bottle, kept its heat for hours.","When he took the stopper out and poured forth a cup it looked oddly black, discolored.","It is quite probable that had there been no series of ""accidents"" he would have drunk a cup--and died in mortal agony.",It contained bichloride of mercury.,Very quietly he set about to make inquiries.,This was really becoming serious.,In the kitchens clown-stairs nothing could be learned.,The maid had set the thermos bottle before the door at ten-thirty.,Norton had opened the door at one-thirty--three hours after.,The outlook was not the cheerfulest.,"He knew perfectly well why all these things ""happened;"" he had interfered with the plans of the scoundrels who were making every possible move to kidnap Florence Hargreave.",One afternoon he paid Florence a visit.,Of course he told her nothing.,They had become secretly engaged the day after he had rescued her from the auto bandits.,They were secretly engaged because Florence wanted it so.,For once Jones suspected nothing.,Why should he?,He had troubles enough.,"As a matter of fact, Norton was afraid of him in the same sense as a boy is afraid of a policeman.","[Illustration: THEY HAD BECOME SECRETLY ENGAGED] But on this day, when the time came, he accosted the butler and drew him into the pantry.","""Jones, they are after me now.""","""You?","Explain.""",Norton briefly recounted the deliberate attempts against his life.,"""You see, I'm not liar enough to say that I'm not worried.","I am, devilishly worried.",I'm not worth any ransom.,"I'm in the way, and they seem determined to put me out of it.""","""To any other man I would say travel.","But to you I say when you leave your rooms don't go where you first thought you would--that is, some usual haunt.","They'll be everywhere, near your restaurants, your clubs, your office.",You're a methodical young man; become erratic.,"Keep away from here for at least three days, but always call me up by telephone some time during the day.","Never under any circumstance, unless I send for you, come here at night.","Only one man now watches the house during the day, but five are prowling around after dark.",They might have instructions to shoot you on sight.,"I can't spare you just at present, Mr. Norton.","You've been a godsend; and if it seems that sometimes I did not trust you fully it was because I did not care to drag you in too deep.""",Deep?,Norton thought of Florence and smiled inwardly.,Could anybody be in deeper than he was?,"Once it was on the tip of his tongue to confess his love for Florence, but the gravity of Jones' countenance was an obstacle to such move; it did not invite it.","To be sure, Jones had no real authority to say what Florence should or should not do with her heart.","Still, from all points of view, it was better to keep the affair under the rose till there came a more propitious hour in which to make the disclosure.","Love, in

you know of their existence only by the bleached bones of them, strewn along the coast.","You who crave adventures on high seas, you purchase a ticket, a steamer chair, and a couple of popular novels, go on board to the blare of a very indifferent brass band, and believe you are adventuring; when, as a matter of fact, you are about to spend a dull week or a fortnight on a water hotel, where the most exciting thing is the bugle's call to meals or the discovery of a card sharp in the smoking-room.","Take a real ship, go as supercargo, to the South Seas; take the side streets of the ocean, and learn what it can do with hurricanes, typhoons, blistering calms, and men's souls.",There will be adventure enough then.,"If you are a weakling, either you are made strong, or you die.","An honest ship, but run down at the heel, rode at anchor in the sound, a fourth-rater of the hooker breed; that is, her principal line of business was hauling barges up and down the coast.","When she could not pick up enough barges to make it pay, why she'd go gallivanting down to Cuba for bales of tobacco or even to the Bermudas for the heaven-smelling onion.",To-day she was an onion ship; which precludes any idea of adventure.,"She was about four thousand tons, and her engines were sternward and not amidship.","She carried two masts and a half-dozen hoist booms, and the only visible sign of anything new on her was her bowsprit.",This was new doubtless because she had poked her nose too far into her last slip.,Her crew was orderly and tractable.,"There were shore drunks, to be sure, because they were sailors; but they were at work.","They moved about briskly, for they were on the point of sailing for the Bahamas--perhaps for more onions.","Presently the windlass creaked and shrilled, and the blobby links, much in need of tar paint, red as fish gills, clattered down into the bow.","Sometimes they painted the chain as it came over; but paint was costly, and this was done only when the anchor threatened to stay on the bottom.","There was a sailor among this crew, and he went by the name of Steve Blossom; and he was one of his kind.","A grimy dime novel protruded rakishly from his hip pocket, and his right cheek was swollen as with the toothache, due, probably, to a generous ""chaw"" of Seaman's Delight.","He was a real tobacco chewer, for he rarely spat.","He was as peaceful as a backwater bay in summer; non-argumentative and passive, he stood his watch in fair weather and foul.",No one gave the anchor any more attention after it came to rest.,The great city over the way was fairy-like in its haziness and softened lines.,"It was the poetry of angles, of shafts and spars of stone;

simply, they did not splice any more effectually than cotton rope and hemp splice.",Sailors are moody and superstitious; at least they generally are on hookers of the _Captain Manners_ breed.,Steve was superstitious and Jim Dunkers was moody and had no thumb on his left hand.,Steve hated the sight of that red nubbin.,"He was quite certain that it had been a whole thumb once, on the way to gouge out somebody's eye, and had inadvertently connected with somebody's teeth.",Spanish doubloons and pearls and diamonds and rubies!,"It was mighty hard not to say these words out loud, too;

and the moment a man has money he has troubles; there is always some one who wants to take it away from you.,"His bunk was on the port side, and there was plenty of hiding space between the iron plates and the wooden partition.","He intended to loosen three or four planks, and then when the time came, slip the box behind them.","Some time during the morning the forecastle would be empty, and then would be his time.",But he suffered the agonies of damnation during the four-hours' watch.,Supposing some fool should go rummaging about his bunk and discover the box?,Suppose ...,But he dared not suppose.,There was nothing to do but wait.,If he created any curiosity on the part of his mates he was lost.,"He would have to divide with them all, from the captain down to the cook's boy.",It was a heart-rending thought.,"From being the most open and frank man aboard, he became the most cunning.","From being a man without enemies, he saw an enemy even in his shadow.",At four o'clock he turned in and slept like a log.,In the morning he found his opportunity.,For half an hour the forecastle was empty of all save himself.,"Feverishly he pried back the boards, found the brace beam, and gently laid the box there.",It was a mighty curious-looking box.,"Once he had stoked up the Chinese coast from the Philippines, and he judged it to be Chinese in origin.",He tried to pry open the cover and feast his eyes upon the treasure; but under the leather and ivory and mother of pearl was impervious steel.,It would take an ax or a crowbar to stir that lid.,He sighed.,"He replaced the boards, and became to all appearances his stolid self again.","But all the way down to the Bahamas he was moody, and when he answered any questions it was with words spoken testily and jerkily.","""I know whut's th' matter,"" said Dunkers.","""He's in love.""","""Shut your mouth!""","""Didn't I tell yuh?""","laughed the tantalizer, dancing toward the companion way.","""Steve's in love, 'r he didn't git drunk enough on shore t' satisfy his whale's belly!""",A boot thudded spitefully against the door jamb.,"""You fellahs let me alone, 'r I'll bash in a couple o' heads!""","""Oh, yuh will, will yuh?""",cried Dunkers from the deck.,"""If yuh want a little exercise, yuh can begin on me, yuh moonsick swab!","Whut's th' matter with yuh, anyhow?",Where'd yuh git this grouch?,Whut've we done t' yuh?,"Huh?""","""You keep out o' my way, that's all.","I'm mindin' my watches, an' don't ask no odds of you duffers.",What if I have a grouch?,Is it any o' your business?,All right.,"When we step ashore at th' Bahamas, Mister Jim Dunkers, I'll tear the ropes out o' your pulley blocks.","But till we git there, you t' th' upper bunk an' me t' mine.""","""Leave th' ol' grouch alone, Jim.",Th' mate won't stand for no scrappin' aboard.,We'll have th' thing done right in th' custom sheds.,"We'll have a finish fight, Queensberry rules, an' may th' best man win.""","""I'm willin',"" said Jim.","""So'm I,"" agreed Steve.",But his intentions were not honorable.,He proposed to desert before any fight took place.,Not that he was physically afraid;

his disputes could be settled only in one manner, by his calloused fists.","When the old mudhook (and some day Steve was going to buy it and hang it over the entrance to the Gilson House) slithered down into the smiling waters of the bay, Steve concluded that discretion was the better part of valor.",He would steal ashore on the quarantine tug which lay alongside.,"He was willing to fight under ordinary circumstances, but he must get his treasure in safety first.",They could call him a welcher if they wanted to;

most valuable asset.","He was furious, not only at the maid, who, he realized, was virtually helpless, but at his own negligence.",In the midst of his violent harangue the bell sounded.,In his bones he knew what was going to be found there.,It was a letter on the back of which was drawn the fatal black mask.,"With shaking fingers he tore open the envelope and read the contents: ""Florence is now in our power.",Only the surrender of the million will save her.,Our agent will call in an hour for an answer.,"THE BLACK HUNDRED.""","As a matter of fact, they had wanted Jones almost as badly as Florence, but her desire for a book--some popular story of the day--had saved him from the net.",The letter had been written against this possibility.,"Jones became cool, now that he knew just what to face.",The Queen Hotel meant nothing.,Florence would not be taken there.,He called up Norton.,"It took all the butler's patience, however, as it required seven different calls to locate the reporter.",Meantime the taxicab containing Florence and Susan spun madly toward the water front.,Here the two were separated by an effective threat.,Florence recognized the man Vroon and knew that to plead for mercy would be a waste of time.,She permitted herself to be led to a waiting launch.,Always when she disobeyed Jones something like this happened.,"But this time they had cunningly struck at her heart, and all thought of her personal safety became as nothing.",For the present she knew that she was in no actual physical danger.,She was merely to be held as a hostage.,Would Susan have mentality enough to tell Jones where the taxicab had stopped?,She doubted.,"In an emergency Susan had proved herself a nonentity, a bundle of hysterical thrills.","As a matter of fact, for once Florence's deductions were happily wrong.","When the chauffeur peremptorily deposited Susan on the lonely country road, several miles from home, she ran hot-foot to the nearest telephone and sent a very concise message home.","Susan was becoming acclimated to this strange, exciting existence.","Norton arrived in due time, and he and Jones were mapping out a plan when Susan's message came.","[Illustration: THEY WERE MAPPING OUT A PLAN WHEN SUSAN'S MESSAGE CAME] ""Good girl!""",said Jones.,"""She's learning.","Can you handle this alone, Norton?","They want me out of the house

morosely.","""We'll put all the questions we wish when we're at our destination.""",And he nodded significantly toward the ships riding at anchor.,Florence felt her heart sink in spite of her abundant courage.,Were they going to take her to sea again?,"She had acquired a horror of the sea, so big, so terrible, so strong.",She had had an experience with its sullen power.,They had gone about four miles down when she looked back longingly toward shore.,Something white seemed to be spinning over the water far behind.,At first she could not discern what it was.,As she watched it it grew and grew.,It finally emerged from the illusion of a gigantic bird into the actuality of an every-day hydroplane.,Her heart gave a great bound.,This flying machine was coming directly toward the launch; it did not deviate a hair's breadth from the line.,"Fortunately the men were looking toward the huge freighter a quarter of a mile farther on, and from their talk it was evident that the freighter was to

for us!""",Vroon stared under his palm.,It was not credible that pursuit had taken place so quickly.,To test yonder man-bird he abruptly changed the course of the launch.,The hydroplane veered its course to suit.,Florence heard her name called faintly.,"One of the men drew his revolver, but Vroon knocked it out of his hand.","""There's the police boat, you fool!""","""Jump!""",a voice called to Florence.,She flung herself into the water without the slightest hesitation.,All this came about something after this fashion.,When Norton arrived at the foot of Corey Street a boatman informed him

away.,Norton had not served twelve years as a metropolitan newspaper man for nothing.,He approached the mechanics who were puttering about the machine.,"""How about twenty apiece?""",he began.,"""For what?""",the men asked.,"""For sending that paddle around a few times.""","""Get into that seat, but don't touch any of those levers,"" one of them warned.","""Twenty is twenty, Jack, and the boss is
