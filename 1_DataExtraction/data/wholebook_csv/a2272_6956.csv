"Reach beyond reach all down the valley gleamed,-- Thick branches ringed them.","Scarce a bowshot past My platan, thro' the woven leaves low-hung, Trembling in meshes of the woven sun, A yellow-sanded pool, shallow and clear, Lay sparkling, brown about the further bank From scarlet-berried ash-trees hanging over.","But suddenly the shallows brake awake With laughter and light voices, and I saw Where Artemis, white goddess incorrupt, Bane of swift beasts, and deadly for straight shaft Unswerving, from a coppice not far off Came to the pool from the hither bank to bathe.","Amid her maiden company she moved, Their cross-thonged yellow buskins scattered off, Unloosed their knotted hair; and thus the pool Received them stepping, shrinking, down to it.","Here they flocked white, and splashed the water-drops On rounded breast and shoulder snowier Than the washed clouds athwart the morning's blue,-- Fresher than river grasses which the herds Pluck from the river in the burning noons.","Their tresses on the summer wind they flung; And some a shining yellow fleece let fall For the sun's envy; others with white hands Lifted a glooming wealth of locks more dark Than deepest wells, but purple in the sun.","And She, their mistress, of the heart unstormed, Stood taller than they all, supreme, and still, Perfectly fair like day, and crowned with hair The color of nipt beech-leaves: Ay, such hair Was mine in years when I was such as these.","I let it fall to cover me, or coiled Its soft thick coils about my throat and arms; Its color like nipt beech-leaves, tawny brown, But in the sun a fountain of live gold.","Even as thus they played, and some lithe maids Upreached white arms to grasp the berried ash, And, plucking the bright bunches, shed them wide By red ripe handfuls, not far off I saw With long stride making down the beechy glade, Clear-eyed, with firm lips laughing, at his heels The clamor of his fifty deep-tongued hounds, Actaeon.","I beheld him not far off, But unto bath and bathers hid from view, Being beyond that mighty rock whereon His wont was to be stretched at dip of eve, When frogs are loud amid the tall-plumed sedge In marshy spots about Asopus' bank,-- Deeming his life was very sweet, his day A pleasant one, the peopled breadths of earth Most fair, and fair the shining tracts of sea; Green solitudes, and broad low-lying plains Made brown with frequent labors of men's hands, And salt, blue, fruitless waters.","But this mount, Cithaeron, bosomed deep in soundless hills, Its fountained vales, its nights of starry calm, Its high chill dawns, its long-drawn golden days,-- Was dearest to him.","Here he dreamed high dreams, And felt within his sinews strength to strive Where strife was sorest and to overcome, And in his heart the thought to do great deeds, With power in all ways to accomplish them.","For had not he done well to men, and done Well to the gods?",Therefore he stood secure.,"But him,--for him--Ah that these eyes should see!-- Approached a sudden stumbling in his ways!","Not yet, not yet he knew a god's fierce wrath, Nor wist of that swift vengeance lying in wait.",And now he came upon a slope of sward Against the pool.,"With startled cry the maids Shrank clamoring round their mistress, or made flight To covert in the hazel thickets.","She Stirred not; but pitiless anger paled her eyes, Intent with deadly purpose.","He, amazed, Stood with his head thrust forward, while his curls Sun-lit lay glorious on his mighty neck,-- Let fall his bow and clanging spear, and gazed Dilate with ecstasy; nor marked the dogs Hush their deep tongues, draw close, and ring him round, And fix upon him strange, red, hungry eyes, And crouch to spring.",This for a moment.,"Then It seemed his strong knees faltered, and he sank.","Then I cried out,--for straight a shuddering stag Sprang one wild leap over the dogs; but they Fastened upon his flanks with a long yell, And reached his throat; and that proud head went down Beneath their wet, red fangs and reeking jaws.","I have lived long, and watched out many days, Yet have not seen that ought is sweet save life, Nor learned that life hath other end than death.","Thick horror like a cloud had veiled my sight, That for a space I saw not, and my ears Were shut from hearing; but when sense grew clear Once more, I only saw the vacant pool Unrippled,--only saw the dreadful sward.","Where dogs lay gorged, or moved in fretful search, Questing uneasily; and some far up The slope, and some at the low water's edge, With snouts set high in air and straining throats Uttered keen howls that smote the echoing hills.","They missed their master's form, nor understood Where was the voice they loved, the hand that reared;-- And some lay watching by the spear and bow Flung down.","And now upon the homeless pack And paling stream arose a noiseless wind Out of the yellow west awhile, and stirred The branches down the valley;

I watch the narrowing flats, the strip Of red clay at the water's lip; Far off the net-reels, brown and high, And boat-masts slim against the sky; Along the ridges of the dikes Wind-beaten scant sea-grass, and spikes Of last year's mullein; down the slopes To landward, in the sun, thick ropes Of blue vetch, and convolvulus, And matted roses glorious.","The liberal blooms o'erbrim my hands; I walk the level, wide marsh-lands; Waist-deep in dusty-blossomed grass I watch the swooping breezes pass In sudden, long, pale lines, that flee Up the deep breast of this green sea.","I listen to the bird that stirs The purple tops, and grasshoppers Whose summer din, before my feet Subsiding, wakes on my retreat.","Again the droning bees hum by; Still-winged, the gray hawk wheels on high; I drink again the wild perfumes, And roll, and crush the grassy blooms.","Blown back to olden days, I fain Would quaff the olden joys again; But all the olden sweetness not The old unmindful peace hath brought.","Wind of this summer afternoon, Thou hast recalled my childhood's June; My heart--still is it satisfied By all the golden summer-tide?","Hast thou one eager yearning filled, Or any restless throbbing stilled, Or hast thou any power to bear Even a little of my care?-- Ever so little of this weight Of weariness canst thou abate?","Ah, poor thy gift indeed, unless Thou bring the old child-heartedness,-- And such a gift to bring is given, Alas, to no wind under heaven!","Wind of the summer afternoon, Be still;

and Clote Scarp launched his birch canoe, And spread his yellow sail, and moved from shore, Though no wind followed, streaming in the sail, Or roughening the clear waters after him.","And all the beasts stood by the shore, and watched.","Then to the west appeared a long red trail Over the wave; and Clote Scarp sailed and sang Till the canoe grew little like a bird, And black, and vanished in the shining trail.","And when the beasts could see his form no more, They still could hear him, singing as he sailed, And still they listened, hanging down their heads In long row, where the thin wave washed and fled.","But when the sound of singing died, and when They lifted up their voices in their grief, Lo!",on the mouth of every beast a strange New tongue!,"Then rose they all and fled apart, Nor met again in council from that day.",A BREAK.,"Oh, the scent of the hyacinth blossom!","The joy of that night,   But the grievous awaking!",The speed of my flight   Thro' the dawn redly breaking!,Gray lay the still sea;   Naked hillside and lea;   And gray with night frost   The wide garden I crossed!,But the hyacinth beds were a-bloom.,"I stooped and plucked one--   In an instant 'twas done,--   And I heard, not far off, a gun boom!","In my bosom   I thrust the crushed blossom;   And turned, and looked back   Where She stood at her pane   Waving sadly farewell once again;   Then down the dim track   Fled amain,   With the flower in my bosom.","Oh, the scent of the hyacinth blossom!","TO A LADY, AFTER HEARING HER READ KEATS' ""NIGHTINGALE.""","This supreme song of him who dreamed   All beauty, and whose heart foreknew The anguish of vain longing, seemed   To breathe new mystery, breathed by you.","As if the rapture of the night,   Moon-tranced, and passion-still, were stirred To some undreamed divine delight   By sudden singing of a bird!",RONDEAU.,TO LOUIS HONORE FRÉCHETTE.,Laurels for song!,"And nobler bays, In old Olympian golden days   Of clamor thro' the clear-eyed morn,   No bowed triumphant head hath borne, Victorious in all Hellas' gaze!","They watched his glowing axles graze The goal, and rent the heavens with praise;--   Yet the supremer heads have worn          Laurels for song."
