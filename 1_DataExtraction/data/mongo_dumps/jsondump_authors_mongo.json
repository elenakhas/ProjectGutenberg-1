Although his existence remains unclear and no writings by him survive, numerous tales credited to him were gathered across the centuries and in many languages in a storytelling tradition that continues to this day. Many of the tales are characterized by animals and inanimate objects that speak, solve problems, and generally have human characteristics.\nScattered details of Aesop's life can be found in ancient sources, including Aristotle, Herodotus, and Plutarch. An ancient literary work called The Aesop Romance tells an episodic, probably highly fictional version of his life, including the traditional description of him as a strikingly ugly slave (\u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) who by his cleverness acquires freedom and becomes an adviser to kings and city-states. Older spellings of his name have included Esop(e) and Isope. Depictions of Aesop in popular culture over the last 2500 years have included many works of art and his appearance as a character in numerous books, films, plays, and television programs."}, "literarymovements": ["fable"], "authornum": "a18"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da2aa"}, "authorname": "Aguilar Grace", "books_info": {"18387": "The Days of Bruce: A Story from Scottish History.

Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children: his stories express themes that transcend age and nationality.\nAndersen's fairy tales, of which no fewer than 3381 works have been translated into more than 125 languages, have become culturally embedded in the West's collective consciousness, readily accessible to children, but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers as well. His most famous fairy tales include \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", \"The Little Mermaid\", \"The Nightingale\", \"The Snow Queen\", \"The Ugly Duckling\", \"The Little Match Girl\" and \"Thumbelina\". His stories have inspired ballets, plays, and animated and live-action films. One of Copenhagen's widest and busiest boulevards is named \"H.C.

January 2, 1920 \u2013 April 6, 1992) was an  American writer and professor of biochemistry at Boston University. He was known for his works of science fiction and popular science. Asimov was a prolific writer who wrote or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards. His books have been published in 9 of the 10 major categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification.Asimov wrote hard science fiction. Along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, Asimov was considered one of the \"Big Three\" science fiction writers during his lifetime. Asimov's most famous work is the \"Foundation\" series; his other major series are the \"Galactic Empire\" series and the Robot series. The Galactic Empire novels are set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series. Later, with Foundation and Earth (1986), he linked this distant future to the Robot stories, creating a unified \"future history\" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A. Heinlein and previously produced by Cordwainer Smith and Poul Anderson. He also wrote hundreds of short stories, including the social science fiction novelette \"Nightfall\", which in 1964 was voted the best short science fiction story of all time by the Science Fiction Writers of America. Asimov wrote the Lucky Starr series of juvenile science-fiction novels using the pen name Paul French.Asimov also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as well as much nonfiction. Most of his popular science books explain concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. Examples include Guide to Science, the three-volume set Understanding Physics, and Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery.  He wrote on numerous other scientific and non-scientific topics, such as  chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, history, biblical exegesis, and literary criticism.\nHe was president of the American Humanist Association. The asteroid 5020 Asimov, a crater on the planet Mars, a Brooklyn elementary school, and a literary award are named in his honor."}, "literarymovements": ["hard sf", "social sf", "golden age of science fiction", "mystery fiction"], "authornum": "a35316"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da2dc"}, "authorname": "Atherton Gertrude Franklin Horn", "books_info": {"31858": "Ancestors: A Novel (English) (as Author)", "7863": "The Avalanche: A Mystery Story (English) (as Author)", "14256": "The Bell in the Fog and Other Stories (English) (as Author)", "25542": "Black Oxen (English) (as Author)", "21903": "The Californians (English) (as Author)", "13246": "The Conqueror: Being the True and Romantic Story of Alexander Hamilton (English) (as Author)", "35512": "A Daughter of the Vine (English) (as Author)", "12270": "The Doomswoman: An Historical Romance of Old California (English) (as Author)", "30502": "The Gorgeous Isle: A Romance; Scene-- Nevis, B.W.I. 1842 (English) (as Author)", "50169": "Hermia Suydam (English) (as Author)", "57922": "Julia France and Her Times: A Novel (English) (as Author)", "48160": "Life in the War Zone (English) (as Author)", "14197": "The Living Present (English) (as Author)", "39443": "Mrs. Balfame: A Novel (English) (as Author)", "51059": "Mrs. Pendleton's Four-in-hand (English) (as Author)", "53009": "Patience Sparhawk and Her Times: A Novel (English) (as Author)", "491": "Rezanov (English) (as Author)", "6091": "Senator North (English) (as Author)", "8535": "The Sisters-In-Law: A Novel of Our Time (English) (as Author)", "6884": "Sleeping Fires: a Novel (English) (as Author)", "12697": "The Splendid Idle Forties: Stories of Old California (English) (as Author)", "56340": "Tower of Ivory: A Novel (English) (as Author)", "50391": "The Travelling Thirds (English) (as Author)", "3706": "The Valiant Runaways (English) (as Author)", "12833": "What Dreams May Come (English) (as Author)", "13496": "The White Morning: A Novel of the Power of the German Women in Wartime (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Atherton"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a263"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da2dd"}, "authorname": "Atherton William H.

Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike.With the publications of Sense and Sensibility (1811),  Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1816), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled Sanditon, but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript, a short epistolary novel Lady Susan, and another unfinished novel, The Watsons. Her six full-length novels have rarely been out of print, although they were published anonymously and brought her moderate success and little fame during her lifetime.\nA significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and sold as a set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.\nAusten has inspired a large number of critical essays and literary anthologies. Her novels have inspired many films, from 1940's Pride and Prejudice to more recent productions like Sense and Sensibility (1995), Emma (1996), Mansfield Park (1999), Pride & Prejudice (2005), and  Love & Friendship (2016)."}, "literarymovements": ["romance novel"], "authornum": "a68"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da2e4"}, "authorname": "Austin Mary Hunter", "books_info": {"27792": "The Arrow-Maker: A Drama in Three Acts (English) (as Author)", "35502": "The Basket Woman: A Book of Indian Tales for Children (English) (as Author)", "44764": "California: The Land of the Sun (English) (as Author)", "365": "The Land of Little Rain (English) (as Author)", "51893": "The Land of Little Rain (English) (as Author)", "10217": "The Land of Little Rain (English) (as Author)", "20359": "The Lovely Lady (English) (as Author)", "9913": "The Trail Book (English) (as Author)", "38592": "A Woman of Genius (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Hunter_Austin"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a201"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da2e5"}, "authorname": "Avery Harold", "books_info": {"36341": "Gunpowder Treason and Plot, and Other Stories for Boys (English) (as Author)", "33680": "Highway Pirates; or, The Secret Place at Coverthorne (English) (as Author)", "29415": "Soldiers of the Queen (English) (as Author)", "10027": "The Triple Alliance, Its Trials and Triumphs (English) (as Author)", "31231": "Under Padlock and Seal (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Avery"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a3270"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da2e6"}, "authorname": "Aycock Roger D.", "books_info": {"32665": "The Anglers of Arz (English) (as Author)", "32209": "Assignment's End (English) (as Author)", "32212": "Clean Break (English) (as Author)", "24949": "Control Group (English) (as Author)", "51518": "The Feeling (English) (as Author)", "32344": "Pet Farm (English) (as Author)", "33839": "Problem on Balak (English) (as Author)", "48880": "Rough Beast (English) (as Author)", "50884": "Today is Forever (English) (as Author)", "31599": "To Remember Charlie By (English) (as Author)", "23103": "Traders Risk (English) (as Author)", "50940": "Wailing Wall (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Dee"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a25679"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da2e7"}, "authorname": "Ayres Ruby M.

He was born and educated in Scotland and then moved to London, where he wrote a number of successful novels and plays. There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys, who inspired him to write about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens (included in The Little White Bird), then to write Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, a \"fairy play\" about an ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland.\nAlthough he continued to write successfully, Peter Pan overshadowed his other work, and is credited with popularising the name Wendy. Barrie unofficially adopted the Davies boys following the deaths of their parents.

He was one of the most prolific writers in England during the early twentieth century. He was known as a writer, orator, poet, sailor, satirist, man of letters, soldier and political activist. His Catholic faith had a strong impact on his works. He was President of the Oxford Union and later MP for Salford from 1906 to 1910. He was a noted disputant, with a number of long-running feuds, but also widely regarded as a humane and sympathetic man. Belloc became a naturalised British subject in 1902, while retaining his French citizenship.\nHis poetry encompassed comic verses for children and religious poetry. His widely sold Cautionary Tales for Children included \"Jim, who ran away from his nurse, and was eaten by a lion\" and \"Matilda, who told lies and was burnt to death\".

His story \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\" has been described as \"one of the most famous and frequently anthologized stories in American literature\"; and his book Tales of Soldiers and Civilians (also published as In the Midst of Life) was named by the Grolier Club as one of the 100 most influential American books printed before 1900.A prolific and versatile writer, Bierce was regarded as one of the most influential journalists in the United States, and as a pioneering writer of realist fiction. For his horror writing, Michael Dirda ranked him alongside Edgar Allan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft. His war stories influenced Stephen Crane, Ernest Hemingway, and others, and he was considered an influential and feared literary critic. In recent decades Bierce has gained wider respect as a fabulist and for his poetry.In December 1913, Bierce traveled to Chihuahua, Mexico, to gain first-hand experience of the Mexican Revolution. He disappeared, and was rumored to be traveling with rebel troops.

Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age. What he called his prophetic works were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form \"what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language\". His visual artistry led 21st-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him \"far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced\". In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham, he produced a diverse and symbolically rich \u0153uvre, which embraced the imagination as \"the body of God\" or \"human existence itself\".Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as \"Pre-Romantic\". A committed Christian who was hostile to the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American Revolutions. Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an amiable relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such as Emanuel Swedenborg. Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes him difficult to classify. The 19th-century scholar William Rossetti characterised him as a \"glorious luminary\", and \"a man not forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable successors\"."}, "literarymovements": ["romanticism", "poetry"], "authornum": "a295"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da37e"}, "authorname": "Blanchan Neltje", "books_info": {"1889": "Bird Neighbors\rAn Introductory Acquaintance with One Hundred and Fifty Birds Commonly Found in the Gardens, Meadows, and Woods About Our Homes (English) (as Author)", "37735": "Bird Neighbors\rAn Introductory Acquaintance with One Hundred and Fifty Birds Commonly Found in the Gardens, Meadows, and Woods About Our Homes (English) (as Author)", "38233": "Birds Every Child Should Know (English) (as Author)", "3003": "Wild FlowersAn Aid to Knowledge of Our Wild Flowers and Their Insect Visitors (English) (as Author)", "8866": "Wild Flowers Worth Knowing (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neltje_Blanchan"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a738"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da37f"}, "authorname": "Blanchard Amy Ella", "books_info": {"31244": "A Dear Little Girl (English) (as Author)", "28966": "A Dear Little Girl at School (English) (as Author)", "41631": "A Dear Little Girl's Summer Holidays (English) (as Author)", "30007": "A Dear Little Girl's Thanksgiving Holidays (English) (as Author)", "56725": "An Everyday Girl: A Story (English) (as Author)", "45601": "The Four Corners (English) (as Author)", "45026": "The Four Corners Abroad (English) (as Author)", "45518": "The Four Corners in Japan (English) (as Author)", "53920": "Kittyboy's Christmas (English) (as Author)", "19988": "Little Maid Marian (English) (as Author)", "19025": "A Sweet Little Maid (English) (as Author)", "46367": "Talbot's Angles (English) (as Author)", "26208": "Three Little Cousins (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Ella_Blanchard"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a8406"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da380"}, "authorname": "Blank Clair", "books_info": {"45343": "The Adventure Girls at Happiness House (English) (as Author)", "44693": "The Adventure Girls at K Bar O (English) (as Author)", "45308": "The Adventure Girls in the Air (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a42876"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da381"}, "authorname": "Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Vicente", "books_info": {"54222": "Blood and Sand (English) (as Author)", "33799": "The Blood of the Arena (English) (as Author)", "38165": "The Cabin [La barraca] (English) (as Author)", "27068": "The Dead CommandFrom the Spanish Los Muertos Mandan (English) (as Author)", "38458": "The Enemies of Women (Los enemigos de la mujer) (English) (as Author)", "1484": "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (English) (as Author)", "39062": "The Last Lion, and Other Tales (English) (as Author)", "21870": "Luna Benamor (English) (as Author)", "11697": "Mare Nostrum (Our Sea): A Novel (English) (as Author)", "29577": "Mayflower (Flor de mayo): A Tale of the Valencian Seashore (English) (as Author)", "12041": "The Shadow of the Cathedral (English) (as Author)", "31821": "S\u00f3nnica (English) (as Author)", "11674": "The Torrent (Entre Naranjos) (English) (as Author)", "18876": "Woman Triumphant (La Maja Desnuda) (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Blasco_Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez", "es": "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Blasco_Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a647"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da382"}, "authorname": "Blatchford Robert", "books_info": {"34534": "Britain for the British (English) (as Author)", "6172": "God and My Neighbour (English) (as Author)", "43466": "Not Guilty: A Defence of the Bottom Dog (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Blatchford"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a1983"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da383"}, "authorname": "Blavatsky H.

In the first half of the 20th century she published nearly 50 books of girls' fiction, the vast majority being boarding school stories. She also published numerous short stories in magazines.\nHer books were commercially successful, widely read by pre-adolescent girls, and influenced them. Though interest in girls' school stories waned after World War II, her books remained popular until the 1960s. They were seen as disruptive and a negative influence on moral standards by some figures in authority during the height of their popularity, and in some cases were banned, or indeed burned, by headmistresses in British girls' schools.While her stories have been much imitated in more recent decades, and many of her motifs and plot elements have since become clich\u00e9s or the subject of parody, they were innovative when they first appeared. Brazil made a major contribution to changing the nature of fiction for girls. She presented a young female point of view which was active, aware of current issues and independent-minded; she recognised adolescence as a time of transition, and accepted girls as having common interests and concerns which could be shared and acted upon."}, "literarymovements": ["school stories"], "authornum": "a2544"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da3b7"}, "authorname": "Brebner Percy James", "books_info": {"9849": "The Brown Mask (English) (as Author)", "34468": "Christopher Quarles: College Professor and Master Detective (English) (as Author)", "13312": "The Light That Lures (English) (as Author)", "9796": "The Master Detective: Being Some Further Investigations of Christopher Quarles (English) (as Author)", "6374": "Princess Maritza (English) (as Author)", "39652": "Vayenne (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a3142"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da3b8"}, "authorname": "Breckenridge Gerald", "books_info": {"39574": "The Radio Boys on Secret Service Duty (English) (as Author)", "14278": "The Radio Boys on the Mexican Border (English) (as Author)", "36314": "The Radio Boys Rescue the Lost Alaska Expedition (English) (as Author)", "35987": "The Radio Boys' Search for the Inca's Treasure (English) (as Author)", "54446": "The Radio Boys Seek the Lost Atlantis (English) (as Author)", "56695": "The Radio Boys with the Border Patrol (English) (as Author)", "28735": "The Radio Boys with the Revenue Guards (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a5443"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da3b9"}, "authorname": "Brereton F.

She also attended a boarding school in Mirfield between 1836 and 1837. At 19 she left Haworth and worked as a governess between 1839 and 1845. After leaving her teaching position, she fulfilled her literary ambitions. She published a volume of poetry with her sisters (Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, 1846) and two novels. Agnes Grey, based upon her experiences as a governess, was published in 1847. Her second and last novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, which is considered to be one of the first sustained feminist novels, appeared in 1848. Like her poems, both her novels were first published under the masculine pen name of Acton Bell. Anne's life was cut short when she died of what is now suspected to be pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of 29.\nPartly because the re-publication of The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was prevented by Charlotte Bront\u00eb after Anne's death, she is not as well known as her sisters.

Humor and a somewhat postmodern outlook carried over into his novels as well. One of his stories, \"Arena\", is officially credited for an adaptation as an episode of the American television series Star Trek.\nAccording to his wife, Fredric Brown hated to write. So he did everything he could to avoid it\u2014he'd play his flute, challenge a friend to a game of chess, or tease Ming Tah, his Siamese cat. If Brown had trouble working out a certain story, he would hop on a long bus trip and just sit and think and plot for days on end.\nWhen Brown finally returned home and sat himself in front of the typewriter, he produced work in a variety of genres: mystery, science fiction, short fantasy, black comedy\u2013and sometimes, all of the above.\n\n\"There are no rules. You can write a story, if you wish, with no conflict, no suspense, no beginning, middle or end. Of course, you have to be regarded as a genius to get away with it, and that's the hardest part \u2013 convincing everybody you're a genius.\"\n-- Fredric Brown"}, "literarymovements": ["science fiction", "fantasy", "mystery fiction"], "authornum": "a32063"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da3d6"}, "authorname": "Browning Elizabeth Barrett", "books_info": {"56621": "Aurora Leigh (English) (as Author)", "25643": "'He Giveth His Beloved Sleep' (English) (as Author)", "13018": "The Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning (Volume 1 of 2) (English) (as Author)", "16646": "The Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning (Volume 2 of 2) (English) (as Author)", "16182": "The Letters of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Barrett, Vol. 1 (of 2) 1845-1846 (English) (as Author)", "20742": "O May I Join the Choir Invisible! and Other Favorite Poems (English) (as Author)", "37452": "The Poetical Works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Volume 1 (English) (as Author)", "33363": "The Poetical Works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Volume 2 (English) (as Author)", "31015": "The Poetical Works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Volume 4 (English) (as Author)", "2002": "Sonnets from the Portuguese (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a781"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da3d7"}, "authorname": "Browning Robert", "books_info": {"2880": "A Blot in the 'Scutcheon (English) (as Author)", "16376": "Browning's Shorter Poems (English) (as Author)", "6670": "Christmas Eve (English) (as Author)", "50954": "The Complete Poetic and Dramatic Works of Robert BrowningCambridge Edition (English) (as Author)", "4253": "Dramatic Romances (English) (as Author)", "59123": "Index of the Project Gutenberg Works of Robert Browning (English) (as Author)", "260": "An Introduction to the Study of Robert Browning's Poetry (English) (as Author)", "16182": "The Letters of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Barrett, Vol. 1 (of 2) 1845-1846 (English) (as Author)", "655": "Life and Letters of Robert Browning (English) (as Author)", "17393": "Men and Women (English) (as Author)", "20742": "O May I Join the Choir Invisible! and Other Favorite Poems (English) (as Author)", "18343": "The Pied Piper of Hamelin (English) (as Author)", "42850": "The Pied Piper of Hamelin, and Other Poems\rEvery Boy's Library (English) (as Author)", "53335": "Pomegranates from an English GardenA selection from the poems of Robert Browning (English) (as Author)", "28041": "Selections from the Poems and Plays of Robert Browning (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Browning"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a146"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da3d8"}, "authorname": "Brown John", "books_info": {"37640": "Health: Five Lay Sermons to Working-People (English) (as Author)", "45929": "Horae subsecivae.

In addition to The Pilgrim's Progress, Bunyan wrote nearly sixty titles, many of them expanded sermons.\nBunyan came from the village of Elstow, near Bedford. He had some schooling and at the age of sixteen joined the Parliamentary Army during the first stage of the English Civil War. After three years in the  army he returned to Elstow and took up the trade of tinker, which he had learned from his father. He became interested in religion after his marriage, attending first the parish church and then joining the Bedford Meeting, a nonconformist group in Bedford, and becoming a preacher. After the restoration of the monarch, when the freedom of nonconformists was curtailed, Bunyan was arrested and spent the next twelve years in jail as he refused to give up preaching. During this time he wrote a spiritual autobiography, Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners, and began work on his most famous book, The Pilgrim's Progress, which was not published until some years after his release.\nBunyan's later years, in spite of another shorter term of imprisonment, were spent in relative comfort as a popular author and preacher, and pastor of the Bedford Meeting. He died aged 59 after falling ill on a journey to London and is buried in Bunhill Fields. The Pilgrim's Progress became one of the most published books in the English language; 1,300 editions having been printed by 1938, 250 years after the author's death.\nHe is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 30 August, and on the liturgical calendar of the United States Episcopal Church on 29 August. Some other churches of the Anglican Communion, such as the Anglican Church of Australia, honour him on the day of his death (31 August)."}, "literarymovements": ["christian fiction", "sermon"], "authornum": "a81"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da3f2"}, "authorname": "Burgess Gelett", "books_info": {"10870": "Are You a Bromide?\rThe Sulphitic Theory Expounded and Exemplified According to the Most Recent Researches into the Psychology of Boredom, Including Many Well-Known Bromidioms Now in Use (English) (as Author)", "59004": "Burgess UnabridgedA new dictionary of words you have always needed (English) (as Author)", "13035": "The Goop Directory of Juvenile Offenders Famous for their Misdeeds and Serving as a Salutary Example for all Virtuous Children (English) (as Author)", "36664": "Goops and How to Be Them (English) (as Author)", "13004": "More Goops and How Not to Be Them: A Manual of Manners for Impolite Infants (English) (as Author)", "55164": "The Picaroons (English) (as Author)", "30656": "The Purple Cow!

He is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of the poets who have written in the Scots language, although much of his writing is also in English and a light Scots dialect, accessible to an audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English, and in these writings his political or civil commentary is often at its bluntest.\nHe is regarded as a pioneer of the Romantic movement, and after his death he became a great source of inspiration to the founders of both liberalism and socialism, and a cultural icon in Scotland and among the Scottish diaspora around the world. Celebration of his life and work became almost a national charismatic cult during the 19th and 20th centuries, and his influence has long been strong on Scottish literature. In 2009 he was chosen as the greatest Scot by the Scottish public in a vote run by Scottish television channel STV.\nAs well as making original compositions, Burns also collected folk songs from across Scotland, often revising or adapting them. His poem (and song) \"Auld Lang Syne\" is often sung at Hogmanay (the last day of the year), and \"Scots Wha Hae\" served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of the country. Other poems and songs of Burns that remain well known across the world today include \"A Red, Red Rose\", \"A Man's a Man for A' That\", \"To a Louse\", \"To a Mouse\", \"The Battle of Sherramuir\", \"Tam o' Shanter\" and \"Ae Fond Kiss\"."}, "literarymovements": ["romanticism"], "authornum": "a583"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da3fc"}, "authorname": "Burpee Lawrence J.

April 1832 in Wiedensahl; \u2020 9. Januar 1908 in Mechtshausen) war einer der einflussreichsten humoristischen Dichter und Zeichner Deutschlands. Seine ersten Bildergeschichten erschienen ab 1859 als Einblattdrucke. In Buchform wurden sie erstmals 1864 unter dem Titel \u201eBilderpossen\u201c ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Schon seit den 1870er Jahren in ganz Deutschland ber\u00fchmt, galt er bei seinem Tod dank seiner \u00e4u\u00dferst volkst\u00fcmlichen Bildergeschichten als \u201eKlassiker des deutschen Humors\u201c. Als Pionier des Comics schuf er u. a. Max und Moritz, Die fromme Helene, Plisch und Plum, Hans Huckebein, der Ungl\u00fccksrabe, die Knopp-Trilogie und weitere, bis heute popul\u00e4re Werke. Oft griff er darin satirisch die Eigenschaften bestimmter Typen oder Gesellschaftsgruppen auf, etwa die Selbstzufriedenheit und Doppelmoral des Spie\u00dfb\u00fcrgers oder die Fr\u00f6mmelei von Geistlichen und Laien. Viele seiner Zweizeiler sind im Deutschen zu festen Redewendungen geworden, z. B. \u201eVater werden ist nicht schwer, Vater sein dagegen sehr\u201c oder \u201eDieses war der erste Streich, doch der zweite folgt sogleich\u201c. \nBusch war ein ernster und verschlossener Mensch, der viele Jahre seines Lebens zur\u00fcckgezogen in der Provinz lebte. Seinen Bildergeschichten ma\u00df er selbst wenig Wert bei und bezeichnete sie als \u201eSchosen\u201c (franz\u00f6sisch chose = Sache, Ding, quelque chose = etwas, irgendwas). Er betrachtete sie zu Beginn nur als Broterwerb, mit dem er nach einem abgebrochenen Kunststudium und jahrelanger finanzieller Abh\u00e4ngigkeit von den Eltern seine dr\u00fcckende wirtschaftliche Situation aufbessern konnte. Sein Versuch, sich als ernsthafter Maler zu etablieren, scheiterte an seinen eigenen Ma\u00dfst\u00e4ben. Die meisten seiner Gem\u00e4lde hat Wilhelm Busch vernichtet, die erhaltenen wirken h\u00e4ufig wie Improvisationen oder fl\u00fcchtige Farbnotizen und lassen sich nur schwer einer malerischen Richtung zuordnen. Seine vom Stil Heinrich Heines und der Philosophie Arthur Schopenhauers beeinflusste Lyrik und  Prosadichtung stie\u00dfen beim Publikum, das mit seinem Namen komische Bildergeschichten verband, auf Unverst\u00e4ndnis. Dass seine k\u00fcnstlerischen Hoffnungen entt\u00e4uscht wurden und er \u00fcbersteigerte Erwartungen an sich selbst zur\u00fccknehmen musste, sublimierte er mit Humor. Dies spiegelt sich sowohl in seinen Bildergeschichten als auch in seinem literarischen Werk wider.", "en": "Heinrich Christian Wilhelm Busch (15 April 1832 \u2013 9 January 1908) was a German humorist, poet, illustrator, and painter. He published comic illustrated cautionary tales from 1859, achieving his most notable works in the 1870s. Busch's illustrations used wood engraving, and later, zincography.\nBusch drew on contemporary parochial and city life, satirizing Catholicism, Philistinism, strict religious morality, and bigotry. His comic text was colourful and entertaining, using onomatopoeia, neologisms, and other figures of speech, that led to some work being banned by the authorities.\nBusch was influential in both poetry and illustration, and became a source for future generations of comic artists. The Katzenjammer Kids was inspired by Busch's Max and Moritz, one of a number of imitations produced in Germany and the United States. The Wilhelm Busch Prize and the Wilhelm Busch Museum help maintain his legacy. The 175th anniversary of his birth in 2007 was celebrated throughout Germany. Busch remains one of the most influential poets and artists in Western Europe.\n\n"}, "literarymovements": ["caricature"], "authornum": "a4959"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da407"}, "authorname": "Busk Rachel Harriette", "books_info": {"44746": "Household stories from the Land of Hofer; or, Popular Myths of Tirol (English) (as Author)", "45859": "Patra\u00f1as; or, Spanish Stories, Legendary and Traditional (English) (as Author)", "43614": "The Valleys of Tirol: Their traditions and customs and how to visit them (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a40608"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da408"}, "authorname": "Butler Elizabeth (Elizabeth Southerden Thompson)", "books_info": {"41638": "An Autobiography (English) (as Author)", "40925": "From sketch-book and diary (English) (as Author)", "46187": "Letters from the Holy Land (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Thompson"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a40898"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da409"}, "authorname": "Butler Ellis Parker", "books_info": {"44153": "The Adventures of a Suburbanite (English) (as Author)", "27317": "The Cheerful Smugglers (English) (as Author)", "44148": "The Confessions of a Daddy (English) (as Author)", "44220": "Dominie Dean: A Novel (English) (as Author)", "28389": "Goat-Feathers (English) (as Author)", "44147": "The Great American Pie Company (English) (as Author)", "44155": "How It Feels to Be Fifty (English) (as Author)", "44219": "The Incubator Baby (English) (as Author)", "44149": "In Pawn (English) (as Author)", "44150": "The Jack-Knife Man (English) (as Author)", "3427": "Kilo : being the love story of Eliph' Hewlitt, book agent (English) (as Author)", "15300": "Mike Flannery On Duty and Off (English) (as Author)", "44151": "Perkins of Portland: Perkins The Great (English) (as Author)", "29721": "Philo Gubb, Correspondence-School Detective (English) (as Author)", "2004": "Pigs is Pigs (English) (as Author)", "44152": "Red Head and Whistle Breeches (English) (as Author)", "44221": "The Revolt: A Play In One Act (English) (as Author)", "26856": "Solander's Radio Tomb (English) (as Author)", "44154": "Swatty: A Story of Real Boys (English) (as Author)", "44146": "That Pup (English) (as Author)", "17937": "The Thin Santa Claus: The Chicken Yard That Was a Christmas Stocking (English) (as Author)", "1285": "The Water Goats, and Other Troubles (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Parker_Butler"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a585"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da40a"}, "authorname": "Butler Joseph", "books_info": {"53346": "The Analogy of Religion to the Constitution and Course of Nature\rTo which are added two brief dissertations: I.

Cabell was well regarded by his contemporaries, including H. L. Mencken, Edmund Wilson, and Sinclair Lewis. His works were considered escapist and fit well in the culture of the 1920s, when they were most popular. For Cabell, veracity was \"the one unpardonable sin, not merely against art, but against human welfare.\"Although escapist, Cabell's works are ironic and satirical. H. L. Mencken disputed Cabell's claim to romanticism and characterized him as \"really the most acidulous of all the anti-romantics. His gaudy heroes ... chase dragons precisely as stockbrockers play golf.\" Cabell saw art as an escape from life, but once the artist creates his ideal world, he finds that it is made up of the same elements that make the real one.Interest in Cabell declined in the 1930s, a decline that has been attributed in part to his failure to move out of his fantasy niche despite the onset of World War II.

Caine's popularity during his lifetime was unprecedented. Writing fifteen novels on subjects of adultery, divorce, domestic violence, illegitimacy, infanticide, religious bigotry and women's rights he became an international literary celebrity, selling ten million books. Caine was the most highly paid novelist of his day. The Eternal City is the first novel to sell over a million copies worldwide. In addition to his books, Caine is the author of more than a dozen plays and was one of the most commercially successful dramatists of his time; many were West End and Broadway productions. Caine adapted seven of his novels for the stage. He collaborated with leading actors and managers, including Wilson Barrett, Viola Allen, Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Louis Napoleon Parker, Mrs Patrick Campbell, George Alexander, and Arthur Collins. Most of Caine's novels were adapted into silent black and white films. A. E. Coleby's 1923 18,454 feet, nineteen-reel film The Prodigal Son became the longest commercially made British film. Alfred Hitchcock's 1929 film The Manxman, is Hitchcock's last silent film.\nBorn in Runcorn to a Manx father and Cumbrian mother, Caine was raised in Liverpool. After spending four years in school, Caine was trained as an architectural draughtsman. While growing up he spent childhood holidays with relatives in the Isle of Man. At seventeen he spent a year there as schoolmaster in Maughold. Afterwards he returned to Liverpool and began a career in journalism, becoming a leader-writer on the Liverpool Mercury. As a lecturer and theatre critic he developed a circle of eminent literary friends that he was influenced by. Caine moved to London at Dante Gabriel Rossetti's suggestion and lived with the poet, acting as secretary and companion during the last years of Rossetti's life.  Following the publication of his Recollections of Rossetti in 1882, Caine began his career as a writer spanning four decades.\nCaine established his residency in the Isle of Man in 1895, where he sat from 1901 to 1908 in the Manx House of Keys, the lower house of its legislature. Caine was elected President of the Manx National Reform League in 1903 and chair of the Keys' Committee that prepared the 1907 petition for constitutional reform. In 1929\nCaine was granted the Freedom of the Borough of Douglas, Isle of Man. Caine visited Russia in 1892 on behalf of the persecuted Jews. In 1895 Caine travelled in the United States and Canada, where he represented the Society of Authors  conducting successful negotiations and obtaining important international copyright concessions from the Dominion Parliament.\nDuring the Great War (1914\u20131918) Caine wrote many patriotic articles and edited King Albert's Book, the proceeds of which went to help Belgian refugees. In 1917, Caine was created an Officer of the Order of Leopold by King Albert I of Belgium. Caine cancelled many literary contracts in America to devote all his time and energy to the British war effort. On the recommendation of the Prime Minister Lloyd George for services as an Allied propagandist in the United States, King George V made him a Knight of the British Empire in 1918 and a Companion of Honour in 1922.

He was editor of Astounding Science Fiction (later called Analog Science Fiction and Fact) from late 1937 until his death and was part of the Golden Age of Science Fiction.  Campbell wrote super-science space opera under his own name and stories under his primary pseudonym, Don A. Stuart. Campbell also used the pen names Karl Van Kampen and Arthur McCann. His novella Who Goes There? was adapted as the films The Thing from Another World (1951), The Thing (1982), and The Thing (2011).\nCampbell began writing science fiction at age 18 while attending MIT. He published six short stories, one novel, and six letters in the science fiction magazine Amazing Stories from 1930 to 1931.  This work established Campbell's reputation as a writer of space adventure. When in 1934 he began to write stories with a different tone, he wrote as Don A. Stuart.  From 1930 until the later part of that decade, Campbell was prolific and successful under both names, though he stopped writing fiction shortly after he became editor of Astounding in 1937.\nIt is as editor of Astounding Science Fiction (later called Analog Science Fiction and Fact) from late 1937 until his death for which Campbell is primarily remembered today. As well, in 1939, Campbell started the fantasy magazine Unknown, although it was canceled after only four years.  Referring to his time spent as an editor, The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction wrote: \"More than any other individual, he helped to shape modern sf.\" Isaac Asimov called Campbell \"the most powerful force in science fiction ever\" and said the \"first ten years of his editorship he dominated the field completely.\"  In his capacity as an editor, Campbell published some of the very earliest work, and helped shape the careers, of virtually every important sf author to debut between 1938 and 1946, including Robert A. Heinlein, Theodore Sturgeon, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke.\nAn increasingly strong interest in pseudoscience later alienated Campbell from many of the writers whose careers he had nurtured; Heinlein, Sturgeon, Asimov, and Clarke rarely worked with him after about 1950.  As well, beginning in the 1960s, Campbell's controversial essays supporting segregation, and other remarks and writings surrounding slavery and race, served to distance him from many in the science fiction community.  Nevertheless, Campbell remained an important figure in science fiction publishing up until his death.  Campbell and Astounding shared one of the inaugural Hugo Awards with H. L. Gold and Galaxy at the 1953 World Science Fiction Convention. Subsequently, Campbell and Astounding (later renamed Analog) won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine seven times.\nShortly after his death in 1971, the University of Kansas science fiction program established the annual John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and also renamed after him its annual Campbell Conference. The World Science Fiction Society established the annual John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Campbell in 1996, in its inaugural class of two deceased and two living persons."}, "literarymovements": ["science fiction"], "authornum": "a9112"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da425"}, "authorname": "Camp Wadsworth", "books_info": {"10869": "The Abandoned Room (English) (as Author)", "33230": "The Gray Mask (English) (as Author)", "33733": "The Guarded Heights (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a3731"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da426"}, "authorname": "Canada.

She is known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving around her fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. Christie also wrote the world's longest-running play, a murder mystery, The Mousetrap, and, under the pen name Mary Westmacott, six romances. In 1971 she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature.Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon. Before marrying and starting a family in London, she had served in a Devon hospital during the First World War, tending to troops coming back from the trenches. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed when The Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring Hercule Poirot, was published in 1920. During the Second World War, she worked as a pharmacy assistant at University College Hospital, London, acquiring a good knowledge of poisons which feature in many of her novels.\nGuinness World Records lists Christie as the best-selling novelist of all time. Her novels have sold roughly 2 billion copies, and her estate claims that her works come third in the rankings of the world's most-widely published books, behind only Shakespeare's works and the Bible. According to Index Translationum, she remains the most-translated individual author, having been translated into at least 103 languages. And Then There Were None is Christie's best-selling novel, with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever, and one of the best-selling books of all time. Christie's stage play The Mousetrap holds the world record for longest initial run. It opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25 November 1952, and as of September 2018 is still running after more than 27,000 performances.In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's highest honour, the Grand Master Award. Later the same year, Witness for the Prosecution received an Edgar Award by the MWA for Best Play.\nIn 2013, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was voted the best crime novel ever by 600 fellow writers of the Crime Writers' Association. On 15 September 2015, coinciding with her 125th birthday, And Then There Were None was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate. Most of her books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games and comics, and more than thirty feature films have been based on her work.\n\n"}, "literarymovements": ["crime fiction", "golden age of detective fiction", "murder mystery", "romance novel", "detective fiction", "thriller"], "authornum": "a451"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da46c"}, "authorname": "Christophe Jules Fran\u00e7ois", "books_info": {"17635": "Repertory of The Comedie Humaine, Complete, A \u2014 Z (English) (as Author)", "2468": "Repertory of The Comedie Humaine, Part 1 (English) (as Author)", "2469": "Repertory of The Comedie Humaine, Part 2 (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a925"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da46d"}, "authorname": "Church Alfred John", "books_info": {"41471": "Callias: A Tale of the Fall of Athens (English) (as Author)", "44083": "The Count of the Saxon Shore; or The Villa in Vectis.\rA Tale of the Departure of the Romans from Britain (English) (as Author)", "55765": "The Faery Queen and Her Knights: Stories Retold from Edmund Spenser (English) (as Author)", "44550": "The Hammer: A Story of the Maccabean Times (English) (as Author)", "41464": "Lords of the World: A story of the fall of Carthage and Corinth (English) (as Author)", "13481": "Roman life in the days of Cicero (English) (as Author)", "24030": "Stories From Livy (English) (as Author)", "14994": "Stories from the Greek Tragedians (English) (as Author)", "40622": "Stories from Virgil (English) (as Author)", "43982": "Stories of the Old World (English) (as Author)", "6370": "The Story of the Odyssey (English) (as Author)", "42197": "With the King at Oxford: A Tale of the Great Rebellion (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_John_Church"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a2020"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da46e"}, "authorname": "Churchill Winston", "books_info": {"58647": "Index of the Project Gutenberg Works of Sir Winston Spencer Churchill (English) (as Author)", "18419": "Liberalism and the Social Problem (English) (as Author)", "14426": "London to Ladysmith via Pretoria (English) (as Author)", "42817": "Lord Randolph Churchill (English) (as Author)", "43035": "My African Journey (English) (as Author)", "4943": "The River War: An Account of the Reconquest of the Sudan (English) (as Author)", "50906": "Savrola: A Tale of the Revolution in Laurania (English) (as Author)", "9404": "The Story of the Malakand Field Force: An Episode of Frontier War (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a1601"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da46f"}, "authorname": "Church J.

He wrote the poems The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan, as well as the major prose work Biographia Literaria. His critical work, especially on William Shakespeare, was highly influential, and he helped introduce German idealist philosophy to English-speaking culture. Coleridge coined many familiar words and phrases, including suspension of disbelief. He had a major influence on Ralph Waldo Emerson and on American transcendentalism.\nThroughout his adult life Coleridge had crippling bouts of anxiety and depression; it has been speculated that he had bipolar disorder, which had not been defined during his lifetime. He was physically unhealthy, which may have stemmed from a bout of rheumatic fever and other childhood illnesses. He was treated for these conditions with laudanum, which fostered a lifelong opium addiction."}, "literarymovements": ["romanticism"], "authornum": "a95"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da496"}, "authorname": "Collingwood W.

His work explored philosophical, social, and political themes, with stories dominated by monopolistic corporations, alternative universes, authoritarian governments, and altered states of consciousness. His writing also reflected his interest in metaphysics and theology, and often drew upon his life experiences in addressing the nature of reality, identity, drug abuse, schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences.\nBorn in Illinois, he eventually moved to California and began publishing science fiction stories in the 1950s. His stories initially found little commercial success. His 1962 alternative history novel The Man in the High Castle earned Dick early acclaim, including a Hugo Award for Best Novel. He followed with science fiction novels such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and Ubik (1969). His 1974 novel Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for best novel. Following a series of religious experiences in February 1974, Dick's work engaged more explicitly with issues of theology, philosophy, and the nature of reality, as in such novels as A Scanner Darkly (1977) and VALIS (1981). A collection of his non-fiction writing on these themes was published posthumously as The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick (2011). He died in 1982, at age 53, due to complications from a stroke.\nDick's writing produced 44 published novels and approximately 121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction magazines during his lifetime.A variety of popular films based on Dick's works have been produced, including  Blade Runner (1982), Total Recall (adapted twice: in 1990 and in 2012), Minority Report (2002), A Scanner Darkly (2006), The Adjustment Bureau (2011), and Blade Runner 2049 (2017). The Man in the High Castle, was made into a multi-season television series.\nIn 2005, Time named Ubik one of the hundred greatest English-language novels published since 1923.

He was the South's spokesperson; he especially wanted to counter what he considered lies in Uncle Tom's Cabin by telling the South's version of the Reconstruction era.\nDixon was a proud racist and believed in white supremacy and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, which he did more than anyone else to popularize. He also opposed female as well as black suffrage. Two of his novels, The Leopard's Spots: A Romance of the White Man's Burden \u2013 1865\u20131900 (1902) and The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan (1905), in which the Klan saves the country, were combined by film director D. W. Griffith in The Birth of a Nation (1915), the most expensive, successful, and innovative movie ever made up to that date. The movie had as direct result the rebirth of the Klan (the second Klan).

Published through the 1930\u2019s, it reflected the death of idealism and a pessimistic view of national politics.\nBorn in Chicago, Dos Passos graduated from Harvard College in 1916. He was well-traveled, visiting Europe and the Middle East, where he learned about literature, art, and architecture. During World War I, he was an ambulance driver for American volunteer groups in Paris and Italy before joining the United States Army Medical Corps.\nIn 1920, his first novel, One Man's Initiation: 1917, was published, and in 1925, his novel Manhattan Transfer became a commercial success. In 1928, he went to the Soviet Union to study socialism, and later became a leading participant in the 1935 First American Writers Congress sponsored by the communist-leaning League of American Writers. He was in Spain in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. The murder of his friend Jos\u00e9 Robles soured his attitude toward Communism, and led to severing his relationship with fellow writer Ernest Hemingway.\nHis U.S.A. trilogy, which consists of the novels The 42nd Parallel (1930), 1919 (1932), and The Big Money (1936), was ranked by the Modern Library in 1998 as 23rd of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.\nBy the 1950s, his political views had changed dramatically, and he had become more conservative. In the 1960s, he campaigned for presidential candidates Barry Goldwater and Richard M. Nixon.\nAs an artist, Dos Passos created his own cover art for his books, influenced by modernism in 1920s Paris. He died in Baltimore, Maryland.

He is noted for the pioneering use of sexual and religious themes in his work, his fascination for, and reworking of, the lore of celebrated pulp heroes, and occasional tongue-in-cheek pseudonymous works written as if by fictional characters. Farmer often mixed real and classic fictional characters and worlds and real and fake authors as epitomized by his Wold Newton family group of books. These tie all classic fictional characters together as real people and blood relatives resulting from an alien conspiracy. Such works as The Other Log of Phileas Fogg (1973) and Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life (1973) are early examples of literary mashup.\nLiterary critic Leslie Fiedler compared Farmer to Ray Bradbury as both being \"provincial American eccentrics\" who \"strain at the classic limits of the [science fiction] form,\" but found Farmer distinctive in that he \"manages to be at once naive and sophisticated in his odd blending of theology, pornography, and adventure.\""}, "literarymovements": ["fantasy fiction"], "authornum": "a33989"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da5bd"}, "authorname": "Farnol Jeffery", "books_info": {"9879": "The Amateur Gentleman (English) (as Author)", "10064": "Beltane the Smith (English) (as Author)", "2424": "Black Bartlemy's Treasure (English) (as Author)", "5257": "The Broad Highway (English) (as Author)", "16074": "The Definite Object: A Romance of New York (English) (as Author)", "8165": "The Geste of Duke Jocelyn (English) (as Author)", "27866": "Great Britain at War (English) (as Author)", "24922": "The Honourable Mr. Tawnish (English) (as Author)", "9835": "Martin Conisby's Vengeance (English) (as Author)", "10418": "The Money Moon: A Romance (English) (as Author)", "2025": "My Lady Caprice (English) (as Author)", "33597": "Our Admirable Betty: A Romance (English) (as Author)", "7059": "Peregrine's Progress (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffery_Farnol"}, "authorabstracts": {"en": "Jeffery Farnol (10 February 1878 \u2013 9 August 1952) was a British writer from 1907 until his death, known for writing more than 40 romance novels, some formulaic and set in the Georgian Era or English Regency period, and swashbucklers.

She was the first full-time American female book reviewer in journalism. Her book Woman in the Nineteenth Century is considered the first major feminist work in the United States.\nBorn Sarah Margaret Fuller in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she was given a substantial early education by her father, Timothy Fuller. She later had more formal schooling and became a teacher before, in 1839, she began overseeing her Conversations series: classes for women meant to compensate for their lack of access to higher education. She became the first editor of the transcendentalist journal The Dial in 1840, before joining the staff of the New York Tribune under Horace Greeley in 1844. By the time she was in her 30s, Fuller had earned a reputation as the best-read person in New England, male or female, and became the first woman allowed to use the library at Harvard College. Her seminal work, Woman in the Nineteenth Century, was published in 1845. A year later, she was sent to Europe for the Tribune as its first female correspondent. She soon became involved with the revolutions in Italy and allied herself with Giuseppe Mazzini. She had a relationship with Giovanni Ossoli, with whom she had a child. All three members of the family died in a shipwreck off Fire Island, New York, as they were traveling to the United States in 1850. Fuller's body was never recovered.\nFuller was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. She also encouraged many other reforms in society, including prison reform and the emancipation of slaves in the United States. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including Susan B. Anthony, cite Fuller as a source of inspiration. Many of her contemporaries, however, were not supportive, including her former friend Harriet Martineau.  She said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist. Shortly after Fuller's death, her importance faded; the editors who prepared her letters to be published, believing her fame would be short-lived, censored or altered much of her work before publication."}, "literarymovements": ["transcendentalism"], "authornum": "a2829"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da623"}, "authorname": "Fullerton George Stuart", "books_info": {"6463": "A Handbook of Ethical Theory (English) (as Author)", "16406": "An Introduction to Philosophy (English) (as Author)", "57998": "On Sameness and Identity: A Psychological Study\rBeing a Contribution to the Foundations of a Theory of Knowledge (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stuart_Fullerton"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a2054"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da624"}, "authorname": "Fullerton Georgiana", "books_info": {"40151": "Constance Sherwood: An Autobiography of the Sixteenth Century (English) (as Author)", "31180": "Ellen Middleton\u2014A Tale (English) (as Author)", "8495": "The Life of St. Frances of Rome, and Others (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgiana_Fullerton"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a2774"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da625"}, "authorname": "Furneaux William S.", "books_info": {"34131": "Butterflies and Moths (British) (English) (as Author)", "42696": "Field and Woodland Plants (English) (as Author)", "42978": "The Sea Shore (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a36811"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da626"}, "authorname": "Furniss Harry", "books_info": {"29425": "The Confessions of a Caricaturist, Vol. 1 (English) (as Author)", "22689": "The Confessions of a Caricaturist, Vol. 2 (English) (as Author)", "29560": "M.

As a pre-teen Gibran emigrated with his family to the United States, where he studied art and began his literary career, writing in both English and Arabic. In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a literary and political rebel. His romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature, especially prose poetry, breaking away from the classical school. In Lebanon, he is still celebrated as a literary hero.A member of the New York Pen League, he is chiefly known in the English-speaking world for his 1923 book The Prophet, an early example of inspirational fiction including a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose. The book sold well despite a cool critical reception, gaining popularity in the 1930s and again especially in the 1960s counterculture.Gibran is the third-best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi. The Prophet has been translated into as many as 110 languages  His mother, Kamila, daughter of a priest, was thirty when he was born; his father, Khalil, was her third husband. As a result of his family's poverty, Gibran received no formal schooling during his youth in Lebanon. However, priests visited him regularly and taught him about the Bible and the Arabic language.\n\nGibran's father initially worked in an apothecary, but with gambling debts he was unable to pay, he went to work for a local Ottoman-appointed administrator. Around 1891, extensive complaints by angry subjects led to the administrator being removed and his staff being investigated. Gibran's father was imprisoned for embezzlement, and his family's property was confiscated by the authorities. Kamila Gibran decided to follow her brother to the United States. Although Gibran's father was released in 1894, Kamila remained resolved and left for New York on June 25, 1895, taking Kahlil, his younger sisters Mariana and Sultana, and his elder half-brother Peter (in Arabic, Butrus).\n\nThe Gibrans settled in Boston's South End, at the time the second-largest Syrian-Lebanese-American community in the United States. Due to a mistake at school, he was registered as \"Kahlil Gibran\". His mother began working as a seamstress peddler, selling lace and linens that she carried from door to door. Gibran started school on September 30, 1895. School officials placed him in a special class for immigrants to learn English. Gibran also enrolled in an art school at Denison House, a nearby settlement house. Through his teachers there, he was introduced to the avant-garde Boston artist, photographer, and publisher Fred Holland Day, who encouraged and supported Gibran in his creative endeavors. A publisher used some of Gibran's drawings for book covers in 1898.\nGibran's mother, along with his elder brother Peter, wanted him to absorb more of his own heritage rather than just the Western aesthetic culture he was attracted to. Thus, at the age of 15, Gibran returned to his homeland to study at a Maronite-run preparatory school and higher-education institute in Beirut, called \"al-Hikma\" (The Wisdom). He started a student literary magazine with a classmate and was elected \"college poet\". He stayed there for several years before returning to Boston in 1902, coming through Ellis Island (a second time) on May 10. Two weeks before he returned to Boston, his sister Sultana died of tuberculosis at the age of 14. The year after, Peter died of the same disease and his mother died of cancer. His sister Mariana supported Gibran and herself by working at a dressmaker's shop."}, "literarymovements": ["parable", "new york pen league", "mahjar"], "authornum": "a1813"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da64e"}, "authorname": "Gibson W.

His works include four novels; epic and lyric poetry; prose and verse dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; literary and aesthetic criticism; and treatises on botany, anatomy, and colour. In addition, there are numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him extant.\nA literary celebrity by the age of 25, Goethe was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Karl August, in 1782 after taking up residence there in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774). He was an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe was a member of the Duke's privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace. In 1998 both these sites together with nine others were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site under the name Classical Weimar.Goethe's first major scientific work, the Metamorphosis of Plants, was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of Italy. In 1791, he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period, Goethe published his second novel, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship; the verse epic Hermann and Dorothea, and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, Faust. His conversations and various common undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and August and Friedrich Schlegel have come to be collectively termed Weimar Classicism.\nThe German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer named Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship one of the four greatest novels ever written (along with Tristram Shandy, La Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse, and Don Quixote), while the American philosopher and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson selected Goethe as one of six \"representative men\" in his work of the same name (along with Plato, Emanuel Swedenborg, Montaigne, Napoleon, and Shakespeare). Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, notably Johann Peter Eckermann's Conversations with Goethe."}, "literarymovements": ["weimar classicism", "romanticism in science", "sturm und drang"], "authornum": "a586"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da668"}, "authorname": "Gogol Nikolai Vasilevich", "books_info": {"58409": "Cossack Tales (English) (as Author)", "1081": "Dead Souls (English) (as Author)", "58070": "Home Life in Russia, Volumes 1 and 2\r[Dead Souls] (English) (as Author)", "3735": "The Inspector-General (English) (as Author)", "36238": "The Mantle, and Other Stories (English) (as Author)", "1197": "Taras Bulba, and Other Tales (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"de": "https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Wassiljewitsch_Gogol", "en": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Gogol", "fi": "https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Gogol"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a531"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da669"}, "authorname": "Gold H.

He was also a five-time nominee for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Around fifteen years before success as a writer, he frequently changed jobs and roamed across the Russian Empire; these experiences would later influence his writing. Gorky's most famous works were The Lower Depths (1902),  Twenty-six Men and a Girl (1899), The Song of the Stormy Petrel (1901), My Childhood (1913\u20131914), Mother (1906), Summerfolk (1904) and Children of the Sun (1905). He had an association with fellow Russian writers Leo Tolstoy and Anton Chekhov; Gorky would later mention them in his memoirs.\nGorky was active with the emerging Marxist social-democratic movement. He publicly opposed the Tsarist regime, and for a time closely associated himself with Vladimir Lenin and Alexander Bogdanov's Bolshevik wing of the party, but later became a bitter critic of Lenin as an overly ambitious, cruel and power-hungry potentate who tolerated no challenge to his authority. For a significant part of his life, he was exiled from Russia and later the Soviet Union. In 1932, he returned to the USSR on Joseph Stalin's personal invitation and lived there until his death in June 1936."}, "literarymovements": ["socialist realism"], "authornum": "a348"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da678"}, "authorname": "Gosse Edmund", "books_info": {"35813": "Aspects and Impressions (English) (as Author)", "2540": "Father and Son: A Study of Two Temperaments (English) (as Author)", "32477": "The Future of English Poetry (English) (as Author)", "11628": "Gossip in a Library (English) (as Author)", "8152": "Henrik Ibsen (English) (as Author)", "28270": "Hypolympia; Or, The Gods in the Island, an Ironic Fantasy (English) (as Author)", "27580": "Raleigh (English) (as Author)", "18649": "Some Diversions of a Man of Letters (English) (as Author)", "19872": "Three French Moralists and The Gallantry of France (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Gosse"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a959"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da679"}, "authorname": "Gosse Philip Henry", "books_info": {"39910": "Omphalos: An Attempt to Untie the Geological Knot (English) (as Author)", "32800": "The Romance of Natural History, Second Series (English) (as Author)", "49022": "A Year at the Shore (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a36052"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da67a"}, "authorname": "Gottschall Rudolf von", "books_info": {"35373": "Withered Leaves: A Novel.

Hamsun's work spans more than 70 years and shows variation with regard to the subject, perspective and environment. He published more than 20 novels, a collection of poetry, some short stories and plays, a travelogue, and some essays.\nThe young Hamsun objected to realism and naturalism. He argued that the main object of modernist literature should be the intricacies of the human mind, that writers should describe the \"whisper of blood, and the pleading of bone marrow\". Hamsun is considered the \"leader of the Neo-Romantic revolt at the turn of the 20th century\", with works such as Hunger (1890), Mysteries (1892), Pan (1894), and Victoria (1898). His later works\u2014in particular his \"Nordland novels\"\u2014were influenced by the Norwegian new realism, portraying everyday life in rural Norway and often employing local dialect, irony, and humour.Hamsun is considered to be \"one of the most influential and innovative literary stylists of the past hundred years\" (ca. 1890\u20131990). He pioneered psychological literature with techniques of stream of consciousness and interior monologue, and influenced authors such as Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka, Maxim Gorky, Stefan Zweig, Henry Miller, Hermann Hesse, and Ernest Hemingway.

A Victorian realist in the tradition of George Eliot, he was influenced both in his novels and in his poetry by Romanticism, especially William Wordsworth. He was highly critical of much in Victorian society, especially on the declining status of rural people in Britain, such as those from his native South West England.\nWhile Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898. Initially, therefore, he gained fame as the author of such novels as Far from the Madding Crowd (1874), The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886), Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1891), and Jude the Obscure (1895). During his lifetime, Hardy's poetry was acclaimed by younger poets (particularly the Georgians) who viewed him as a mentor. After his death his poems were lauded by Ezra Pound, W. H. Auden and Philip Larkin.Many of his novels concern tragic characters struggling against their passions and social circumstances, and they are often set in the semi-fictional region of Wessex; initially based on the medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom, Hardy's Wessex eventually came to include the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, Hampshire and much of Berkshire, in southwest and south central England. Two of his novels, Tess of the d'Urbervilles and Far from the Madding Crowd, were listed in the top 50 on the BBC's survey The Big Read."}, "literarymovements": ["naturalism", "victorian literature"], "authornum": "a23"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da6da"}, "authorname": "Hare Augustus J.

The topics she wrote and spoke about include: \"enslavement and abolitionism, human rights and dignity, women's rights and equality, racial and social justice, lynching and mob violence, voting rights, moral character, racial self-help and uplift, and multiracial cooperation for common good.\" She was active in social reform and was a member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which advocated the federal government taking a role in progressive reform. She is considered \"the mother of African-American journalism.\"Born free in Baltimore, Maryland, she had a long and prolific career, publishing her first book of poetry at the age of 20, making her one of the first African-American published writers. At 67, she wrote her widely praised novel Iola Leroy (1892). In 1850, she became the first woman to teach sewing at the Union Seminary. In 1851, alongside William Still, chairman of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, she helped escaped slaves along the Underground Railroad on their way to Canada. She began her career as a public speaker and political activist after joining the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1853.\nPoems on Miscellaneous Subjects (1854) became her biggest commercial success. Her short story \"Two Offers\" was published in the Anglo-African in 1859, making literary history by being the first short story published by a black woman.\nHarper founded, supported and held high office in several national progressive organizations. In 1883 she became superintendent of the Colored Section of the Philadelphia and Pennsylvania Women's Christian Temperance Union. In 1894 she helped found the National Association of Colored Women and served as its vice president.\nHarper died aged 85 on February 22, 1911, nine years before women gained the right to vote.\n\n"}, "literarymovements": ["essays", "poetry", "short story"], "authornum": "a345"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da6df"}, "authorname": "Harper Ida Husted", "books_info": {"15220": "The Life and Work of Susan B.

Dezember 1797 als Harry Heine in D\u00fcsseldorf, Herzogtum Berg; \u2020 17. Februar 1856 in Paris) war einer der bedeutendsten deutschen Dichter, Schriftsteller und Journalisten des 19. Jahrhunderts.\nHeine gilt als \u201eletzter Dichter der Romantik\u201c und zugleich als deren \u00dcberwinder. Er machte die Alltagssprache lyrikf\u00e4hig, erhob das Feuilleton und den Reisebericht zur Kunstform und verlieh der deutschen Literatur eine zuvor nicht gekannte elegante Leichtigkeit. Die Werke kaum eines anderen Dichters deutscher Sprache wurden bis heute so h\u00e4ufig \u00fcbersetzt und vertont. Als kritischer, politisch engagierter Journalist, Essayist, Satiriker und Polemiker war Heine ebenso bewundert wie gef\u00fcrchtet. Im Deutschen Bund mit Publikationsverboten belegt, verbrachte er seine zweite Lebensh\u00e4lfte im Pariser Exil. Antisemiten und Nationalisten feindeten Heine wegen seiner j\u00fcdischen Herkunft und seiner politischen Haltung \u00fcber den Tod hinaus an. Die Au\u00dfenseiterrolle pr\u00e4gte sein Leben, sein Werk und dessen Rezeptionsgeschichte.", "en": "Christian Johann Heinrich Heine (German: [\u02c8ha\u026an\u0281\u026a\u00e7 \u02c8ha\u026an\u0259]; 13 December 1797 \u2013 17 February 1856) was a German-Jewish poet, journalist, essayist, and literary critic. He is best known outside of Germany for his early lyric poetry, which was set to music in the form of Lieder (art songs) by composers such as Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert. Heine's later verse and prose are distinguished by their satirical wit and irony. He is considered part of the Young Germany movement. His radical political views led to many of his works being banned by German authorities\u2014which, however, only added to his fame. He spent the last 25 years of his life as an expatriate in Paris."}, "literarymovements": ["romanticism"], "authornum": "a1049"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da710"}, "authorname": "Helps Arthur Sir", "books_info": {"30238": "The Claims of Labour: An essay on the duties of the employers to the employed (English) (as Author)", "7438": "Friends in Council \u2014 First Series (English) (as Author)", "15336": "The Life of Columbus (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Helps"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a2469"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da711"}, "authorname": "Hemstreet Charles", "books_info": {"31814": "Literary New York: Its Landmarks and Associations (English) (as Author)", "40072": "Nooks and Corners of Old London (English) (as Author)", "39789": "Nooks & Corners of Old New York (English) (as Author)", "13842": "The Story of Manhattan (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a5242"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da712"}, "authorname": "Hemyng Bracebridge", "books_info": {"7335": "Jack Harkaway and His Son's Escape from the Brigands of Greece (English) (as Author)", "46588": "Jack Harkaway in New York; or, The Adventures of the Travelers' Club (English) (as Author)", "20320": "Jack Harkaway's Boy Tinker Among The TurksBook Number Fifteen in the Jack Harkaway Series (English) (as Author)", "46653": "The Slave of the Mine; or, Jack Harkaway in 'Frisco (English) (as Author)", "59012": "Young Jack Harkaway Fighting the Pirates of the Red Sea (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a2425"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da713"}, "authorname": "Henderson W.

He produced a large body of work, consisting of essays, short fiction, and novels, spanning several overlapping genres including horror, fantastic fiction, and science fiction. Hodgson used his experiences at sea to lend authentic detail to his short horror stories, many of which are set on the ocean, including his series of linked tales forming the \"Sargasso Sea Stories\". His novels, such as The House on the Borderland (1908) and The Night Land (1912), feature more cosmic themes, but several of his novels also focus on horrors associated with the sea. Early in his writing career Hodgson dedicated effort to poetry, although few of his poems were published during his lifetime. He also attracted some notice as a photographer and achieved renown as a bodybuilder. He died in World War I at age 40."}, "literarymovements": ["weird fiction", "horror fiction"], "authornum": "a3260"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da736"}, "authorname": "Hoffmann E. T. A.

The rhetorician Quintilian regarded his Odes as just about the only Latin lyrics worth reading: \"He can be lofty sometimes, yet he is also full of charm and grace, versatile in his figures, and felicitously daring in his choice of words.\"Horace also crafted elegant hexameter verses (Satires and Epistles) and caustic iambic poetry (Epodes). The hexameters are amusing yet serious works, friendly in tone, leading the ancient satirist Persius to comment: \"as his friend laughs, Horace slyly puts his finger on his every fault; once let in, he plays about the heartstrings\".His career coincided with Rome's momentous change from a republic to an empire. An officer in the republican army defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, he was befriended by Octavian's right-hand man in civil affairs, Maecenas,  and became a spokesman for the new regime. For some commentators, his association with the regime was a delicate balance in which he maintained a strong measure of independence (he was \"a master of the graceful sidestep\") but for others he was, in John Dryden's phrase, \"a well-mannered court slave\"."}, "literarymovements": ["lyric poetry"], "authornum": "a1790"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da755"}, "authorname": "Hornaday William T.

He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre.\nHoward was born and raised in Texas. He spent most of his life in the town of Cross Plains, with some time spent in nearby Brownwood. A bookish and intellectual child, he was also a fan of boxing and spent some time in his late teens bodybuilding, eventually taking up amateur boxing. From the age of nine he dreamed of becoming a writer of adventure fiction but did not have real success until he was 23. Thereafter, until his death by suicide at age 30, Howard's writings were published in a wide selection of magazines, journals, and newspapers, and he became proficient in several subgenres. His greatest success occurred after his death.\nAlthough a Conan novel was nearly published in 1934, Howard's stories were never collected during his lifetime. The main outlet for his stories was Weird Tales, where Howard created Conan the Barbarian. With Conan and his other heroes, Howard helped fashion the genre now known as sword and sorcery, spawning many imitators and giving him a large influence in the fantasy field. Howard remains a highly read author, with his best works still reprinted.\nHoward's suicide and the circumstances surrounding it have led to speculation about his mental health. His mother had been ill with tuberculosis his entire life, and upon learning she had entered a coma from which she was not expected to wake, he walked out to his car and shot himself in the head."}, "literarymovements": ["historical novel", "sword and sorcery", "boxing", "horror fiction", "weird fiction", "western fiction"], "authornum": "a36031"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da75f"}, "authorname": "Howe Julia Ward", "books_info": {"38127": "From the Oak to the Olive: A Plain record of a Pleasant Journey (English) (as Author)", "34271": "Is Polite Society Polite? and Other Essays (English) (as Author)", "32511": "Margaret Fuller (Marchesa Ossoli) (English) (as Author)", "36489": "Modern Society (English) (as Author)", "32603": "Reminiscences, 1819-1899 (English) (as Author)", "38203": "A Trip to Cuba (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Ward_Howe"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a35885"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da760"}, "authorname": "Howitt William", "books_info": {"54800": "Colonization and ChristianityA popular history of the treatment of the natives by theEuropeans in all their colonies (English) (as Author)", "41164": "Homes and Haunts of the Most Eminent British Poets, Vol. 1 (of 2) (English) (as Author)", "45887": "Homes and Haunts of the Most Eminent British Poets, Vol. 2 (of 2) (English) (as Author)", "43245": "Luke Barnicott, and Other Stories (English) (as Author)", "36576": "The Student-Life of Germany (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a38358"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da761"}, "authorname": "Hubback Mrs. (CatherineAnne Austen)", "books_info": {"54010": "The Younger Sister: A Novel, Vol. I.

The most popular of her four novels is Their Eyes Were Watching God, published in 1937. She also wrote more than 50 short stories, plays, and essays.\nHurston was born in Notasulga, Alabama, and moved with her family to Eatonville, Florida, in 1894. She later used Eatonville as the setting for many of her stories. It is now the site of the Zora! Festival, held each year in her honor.In her early career, Hurston conducted anthropological and ethnographic research while a student at Barnard College and Columbia University. She had an interest in African-American and Caribbean folklore, and how these contributed to the community's identity. \nShe also wrote fiction about contemporary issues in the black community and became a central figure of the Harlem Renaissance. Her short satires, drawing from the African-American experience and racial division, were published in anthologies such as The New Negro and Fire!! After moving back to Florida, Hurston wrote and published her literary anthropology on African-American folklore in North Florida, Mules and Men (1935), and her first three novels: Jonah's Gourd Vine (1934); Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937); and Moses, Man of the Mountain (1939). Also published during this time was Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica (1938), documenting her research on rituals in Jamaica and Haiti.\nHurston's works concerned both the African-American experience and her struggles as an African-American woman. Her novels went relatively unrecognized by the literary world for decades. Interest was revived in 1975 after author Alice Walker published an article, \"In Search of Zora Neale Hurston\", in the March issue of Ms. magazine that year. Hurston's manuscript Every Tongue Got to Confess, a collection of folktales gathered in the 1920s, was published posthumously in 2001 after being discovered in the Smithsonian archives. Her nonfiction book Barracoon: The Story of the Last \"Black Cargo\", about the life of Cudjoe Lewis (Kossola), was published posthumously in 2018."}, "literarymovements": ["harlem renaissance"], "authornum": "a6368"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da77f"}, "authorname": "Hutchens Paul", "books_info": {"58514": "The Green Tent Mystery at Sugar Creek (English) (as Author)", "58626": "North Woods Manhunt (A Sugar Creek Gang Story) (English) (as Author)", "27426": "Shenanigans at Sugar Creek (English) (as Author)", "56553": "The Sugar Creek Gang Digs for Treasure (English) (as Author)", "56554": "The Sugar Creek Gang Goes North (English) (as Author)", "58628": "Watermelon Mystery at Sugar Creek (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hutchens"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a32685"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da780"}, "authorname": "Hutcheson John C.

K. or J.-K.). He is most famous for the novel \u00c0 rebours (1884, published in English as Against the Grain or Against Nature). He supported himself by a 30-year career in the French civil service.\nHuysmans' work is considered remarkable for its idiosyncratic use of the French language, large vocabulary, descriptions, satirical wit and far-ranging erudition. First considered part of Naturalism, he became associated with the decadent movement with his publication of \u00c0 rebours. His work expressed his deep pessimism, which had led him to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. In later years, his novels reflected his study of Catholicism, religious conversion, and becoming an oblate. He discussed the iconography of Christian architecture at length in La cath\u00e9drale (1898), set at Chartres and with its cathedral as the focus of the book.\nL\u00e0-bas (1891), En route (1895) and La cath\u00e9drale (1898) are a trilogy that feature Durtal, an autobiographical character whose spiritual progress is tracked and who converts to Catholicism.

As one of the founders of modernism in theatre, Ibsen is often referred to as \"the father of realism\" and one of the most influential playwrights of his time. His major works include Brand, Peer Gynt, An Enemy of the People, Emperor and Galilean, A Doll's House, Hedda Gabler, Ghosts, The Wild Duck, When We Dead Awaken, Pillars of Society, The Lady from the Sea, Rosmersholm, The Master Builder, and John Gabriel Borkman. He is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after Shakespeare, and by the early 20th century A Doll's House became the world's most performed play.Several of his later dramas were considered scandalous to many of his era, when European theatre was expected to model strict morals of family life and propriety. Ibsen's later work examined the realities that lay behind the fa\u00e7ades, revealing much that was disquieting to a number of his contemporaries. He had a critical eye and conducted a free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. His early poetic and cinematic play Peer Gynt, however, has also strong surreal elements.Ibsen is often ranked as one of the most distinguished playwrights in the European tradition. Richard Hornby describes him as \"a profound poetic dramatist\u2014the best since Shakespeare\". He is widely regarded as the most important playwright since Shakespeare. He influenced other playwrights and novelists such as George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Miller, James Joyce, Eugene O'Neill, and Miroslav Krle\u017ea. Ibsen was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1902, 1903, and 1904.Ibsen wrote his plays in Danish (the common written language of Denmark and Norway during his lifetime) and they were published by the Danish publisher Gyldendal. Although most of his plays are set in Norway\u2014often in places reminiscent of Skien, the port town where he grew up\u2014Ibsen lived for 27 years in Italy and Germany, and rarely visited Norway during his most productive years. Born into a merchant family connected to the patriciate of Skien, Ibsen shaped his dramas according to his family background. He was the father of Prime Minister Sigurd Ibsen. Ibsen's dramas have a strong influence upon contemporary culture."}, "literarymovements": ["naturalism", "realism"], "authornum": "a861"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da78a"}, "authorname": "Imbert de SaintAmand", "books_info": {"9831": "The Court of the Empress Josephine (English) (as Author)", "4289": "The Duchess of Berry and the Court of Charles X (English) (as Author)", "8575": "The Happy Days of the Empress Marie Louise (English) (as Author)", "32408": "Marie Antoinette and the Downfall of Royalty (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a1431"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da78b"}, "authorname": "Inchbald Mrs.", "books_info": {"4554": "Lover's Vows (English) (as Author)", "3787": "Nature and Art (English) (as Author)", "38759": "Next Door Neighbours: A Comedy; In Three Acts (English) (as Author)", "22002": "A Simple Story (English) (as Author)", "38653": "Such Things Are: A Play, in Five Acts (English) (as Author)", "35959": "The Widow's Vow: A Farce, in Two Acts (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Inchbald"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a1305"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da78c"}, "authorname": "Ingelow Jean", "books_info": {"12303": "Fated to Be Free: A Novel (English) (as Author)", "32867": "Mopsa the Fairy (English) (as Author)", "13223": "Poems by Jean Ingelow, In Two Volumes, Volume I.

He is best known for his short stories \"Rip Van Winkle\" (1819) and \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" (1820), both of which appear in his collection The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. His historical works include biographies of Oliver Goldsmith, Islamic prophet Muhammad, and George Washington, as well as several histories of 15th century Spain that deal with subjects such as Alhambra, Christopher Columbus, and the Moors. \nIrving served as ambassador to Spain from 1842 to 1846. He made his literary debut in 1802 with a series of observational letters to the Morning Chronicle, written under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle. He moved to England for the family business in 1815 where he achieved fame with the publication of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., serialized from 1819\u201320. He continued to publish regularly throughout his life, and he completed a five-volume biography of George Washington just eight months before his death at age 76 in Tarrytown, New York.\nIrving was one of the first American writers to earn acclaim in Europe, and he encouraged other American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allan Poe. He was also admired by some British writers, including Lord Byron, Thomas Campbell, Charles Dickens, Francis Jeffrey, and Walter Scott. He advocated for writing as a legitimate profession and argued for stronger laws to protect American writers from copyright infringement."}, "literarymovements": ["romanticism"], "authornum": "a34"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da796"}, "authorname": "Irwin Wallace", "books_info": {"5332": "The Love Sonnets of a Car Conductor (English) (as Author)", "4756": "The Love Sonnets of a Hoodlum (English) (as Author)", "5408": "The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Jr. (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Irwin"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a1567"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da797"}, "authorname": "Irwin Will", "books_info": {"3314": "The City That Was: A Requiem of Old San Francisco (English) (as Author)", "12678": "The House of Mystery: An Episode in the Career of Rosalie Le Grange, Clairvoyant (English) (as Author)", "55164": "The Picaroons (English) (as Author)", "28443": "The Readjustment (English) (as Author)", "24735": "Stanford Stories: Tales of a Young University (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Irwin"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a26707"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da798"}, "authorname": "Isham Frederic Stewart", "books_info": {"14249": "Half A Chance (English) (as Author)", "36083": "The Lady of the Mount (English) (as Author)", "10402": "A Man and His Money (English) (as Author)", "43916": "Nothing But the Truth (English) (as Author)", "29726": "The Strollers (English) (as Author)", "23675": "Under the Rose (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a3515"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da799"}, "authorname": "Jacks L.

He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge (1913\u201315).\nThough James's work as a medievalist and scholar is still highly regarded, he is best remembered for his ghost stories, which some regard as among the best in the genre. James redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal Gothic clich\u00e9s of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings. However, James's protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests.

Johnson established his reputation as a writer, and was known during the Harlem Renaissance for his poems, novels, and anthologies collecting both poems and spirituals of black culture.\nHe was appointed under President Theodore Roosevelt as US consul in Venezuela and Nicaragua for most of the period from 1906 to 1913. In 1934 he was the first African-American professor to be hired at New York University. Later in life, he was a professor of creative literature and writing at Fisk University, a historically black university."}, "literarymovements": ["harlem renaissance"], "authornum": "a3793"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7bd"}, "authorname": "Johnson Owen", "books_info": {"46892": "The Eternal Boy: Being the Story of the Prodigious Hickey (English) (as Author)", "46098": "In the Name of Liberty: A Story of the Terror (English) (as Author)", "33761": "Making Money (English) (as Author)", "46358": "Max Fargus (English) (as Author)", "12686": "Murder in Any Degree (English) (as Author)", "36355": "The Salamander (English) (as Author)", "25465": "Skippy Bedelle\rHis Sentimental Progress From the Urchin to the Complete Man of the World (English) (as Author)", "46674": "Stover at Yale (English) (as Author)", "25272": "The Varmint (English) (as Author)", "47910": "The Wasted Generation (English) (as Author)", "47640": "The Woman Gives: A Story of Regeneration (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Johnson"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a4502"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7be"}, "authorname": "Johnson Rossiter", "books_info": {"47746": "Campfire and BattlefieldAn Illustrated History of the Campaigns and Conflicts of the Great Civil War (English) (as Author)", "48404": "The Hero of Manila: Dewey on the Mississippi and the Pacific (English) (as Author)", "49393": "A History, of the War of 1812-15 Between the United States and Great Britain (English) (as Author)", "48313": "Phaeton Rogers: A Novel of Boy Life (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossiter_Johnson"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a3308"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7bf"}, "authorname": "Johnson Samuel", "books_info": {"10835": "Dr. Johnson's Works: Life, Poems, and Tales, Volume 1\rThe Works of Samuel Johnson, LL.D., in Nine Volumes (English) (as Author)", "15097": "A Grammar of the English Tongue (English) (as Author)", "4679": "Johnson's Lives of the Poets \u2014 Volume 1 (English) (as Author)", "4678": "Johnson's Lives of the Poets \u2014 Volume 2 (English) (as Author)", "2064": "A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (English) (as Author)", "5101": "Lives of the English Poets : Prior, Congreve, Blackmore, Pope (English) (as Author)", "5098": "Lives of the English Poets : Waller, Milton, Cowley (English) (as Author)", "9823": "Lives of the Poets, Volume 1 (English) (as Author)", "7780": "Notes to Shakespeare \u2014 Volume 01: Comedies (English) (as Author)", "15566": "Notes to Shakespeare, Volume III: The Tragedies (English) (as Author)", "11254": "Poetical Works of Johnson, Parnell, Gray, and SmollettWith Memoirs, Critical Dissertations, and Explanatory Notes (English) (as Author)", "5430": "Preface to a Dictionary of the English Language (English) (as Author)", "5429": "Preface to Shakespeare (English) (as Author)", "652": "Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia (English) (as Author)", "34766": "Shorter Novels, Eighteenth Century\rThe History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia; The Castle of Otranto, a Gothic Story; Vathek, an Arabian Tale (English) (as Author)", "13350": "The Vanity of Human Wishes (1749) and Two Rambler papers (1750) (English) (as Author)", "577": "The Works of Samuel Johnson, in Sixteen Volumes.

He resigned his ministry following his experiences in the First World War and caused a scandal with his 1921 novel Simon Called Peter, the tale of a priest's wartime affair with a young nurse. The book sold 600,000 copies in the 1920s alone, was referenced in The Great Gatsby, and was cited in a double murder investigation. F\u00eated in the United States, but critically less than well-received, Keable moved to Tahiti where he continued to write, producing both novels and theological works, until his death at age 40 of a kidney complaint.\nKeable was raised in Bedfordshire and educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He entered a theological college after graduation and was ordained a priest in 1911. He spent the next several years as a missionary in Africa, stationed on Zanzibar and in Basutoland, before returning to Europe as an army chaplain during the First World War. There, he met and fell in love with a young nurse, Grace Eileen Joly Beresford Buck, a development over which he eventually quit the Church of England and left his wife, Sybil. Returning to England after the war, Keable resigned his ministry and began to write novels: his first, 1921's Simon Called Peter, became a runaway success and launched Keable into a life of literary celebrity. Increasingly disillusioned with the hypocrisies he saw in contemporary British life, he and Buck left Europe for Tahiti in 1922. The couple lived there happily until Buck's death in childbirth in 1924, after which Keable's health began to fade. He nonetheless struck up a later relationship with a Tahitian woman, Ina, with whom he had a son, and continued to publish novels until his death of a kidney condition in 1927.\nKeable's most famous publication was his first novel, Simon Called Peter, but he produced a prodigious literary output, spanning theological tracts through poetry to travel guides. Simon Called Peter's sequel, Recompense, was made into a film, and his later novels all attracted substantial attention. His writings generally met with much greater popular than critical approbation, and Simon Called Peter was sufficiently incendiary to be banned. The book nonetheless became a contemporary best-seller.\nMuch of Keable's fiction contained autobiographical elements, often centring on his attitudes toward and experience of the Christian religious establishment. As well as these fictional explorations he produced a final, non-fiction work, The Great Galilean, outlining the religious views he developed during a lifetime's uneasy relationship to Anglicanism and Catholicism. He came to believe that the historical Jesus bore little relationship to the Jesus of Christian tradition, and, in The Great Galilean, attempted to reconcile his ambivalence about the orthodoxies of the Church with his enduring belief in an all-loving God. Keable's views earned him many unfavourable reviews and the contempt of the church in which he had practised, but foreshadowed ideas of free love that became prominent later in the 20th century."}, "literarymovements": ["war novel", "romance novel"], "authornum": "a5579"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7e2"}, "authorname": "Keats John", "books_info": {"24280": "Endymion: A Poetic Romance (English) (as Author)", "23684": "Keats: Poems Published in 1820 (English) (as Author)", "2490": "Lamia (English) (as Author)", "35698": "Letters of John Keats to His Family and Friends (English) (as Author)", "8209": "Poems 1817 (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats"}, "authorabstracts": {"en": "John Keats (; 31 October 1795 \u2013 23 February 1821) was an English Romantic poet. He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets, along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley, despite his works having been in publication for only four years before his death from tuberculosis at the age of 25.Although his poems were not generally well received by critics during his lifetime, his reputation grew after his death, and by the end of the 19th century, he had become one of the most beloved of all English poets. He had a significant influence on a diverse range of poets and writers. Jorge Luis Borges stated that his first encounter with Keats' work was the most significant literary experience of his life.The poetry of Keats is characterised by sensual imagery, most notably in the series of odes. This is typical of romantic poets, as they aimed to accentuate extreme emotion through an emphasis on natural imagery. Today his poems and letters are some of the most popular and most analysed in English literature. Some of the most acclaimed works of Keats are \"Ode to a Nightingale\", \"Sleep and Poetry\", and the famous sonnet \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\"."}, "literarymovements": ["romanticism"], "authornum": "a935"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7e3"}, "authorname": "Keck Christine M.", "books_info": {"6963": "Elson Grammar School Literature v4 (English) (as Author)", "9106": "The Elson Readers, Book 5 (English) (as Author)", "54825": "Junior High School Literature, Book 1 (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a4654"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7e4"}, "authorname": "Keefe Eugene K.", "books_info": {"32129": "Area Handbook for Albania (English) (as Author)", "32627": "Area Handbook for Bulgaria (English) (as Author)", "32700": "Area Handbook for Romania (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a35675"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7e5"}, "authorname": "Keesey Walter M.", "books_info": {"54197": "Cambridge: A Sketch-Book (English) (as Author)", "54198": "Canterbury: A Sketch Book (English) (as Author)", "54355": "Harrow: A Sketch Book (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a47758"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7e6"}, "authorname": "Keightley Thomas", "books_info": {"41006": "The Fairy MythologyIllustrative of the Romance and Superstition of Various Countries (English) (as Author)", "38785": "Secret Societies of the Middle Ages (English) (as Author)", "45160": "The Shakespeare-Expositor: An Aid to the Perfect Understanding of Shakespeare's Plays (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a4962"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7e7"}, "authorname": "Kelland Clarence Budington", "books_info": {"56247": "Catty Atkins (English) (as Author)", "56718": "Catty Atkins, Sailorman (English) (as Author)", "46252": "The Highflyers (English) (as Author)", "57884": "The Little Moment of Happiness (English) (as Author)", "57165": "Mark Tidd: His Adventures and Strategies (English) (as Author)", "46269": "Mark Tidd in Business (English) (as Author)", "57197": "Mark Tidd in the Backwoods (English) (as Author)", "57229": "Mark Tidd, Manufacturer (English) (as Author)", "57199": "Mark Tidd's Citadel (English) (as Author)", "13307": "Scattergood Baines (English) (as Author)", "44079": "Sudden Jim (English) (as Author)", "5797": "Youth Challenges (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Budington_Kelland"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a4987"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7e8"}, "authorname": "Keller Gottfried", "books_info": {"34506": "German Fiction (English) (as Author)", "34505": "Seldwyla Folks: Three Singular Tales (English) (as Author)", "34504": "Seven Legends (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"de": "http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Keller", "en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Keller"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a2159"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7e9"}, "authorname": "Keller Helen", "books_info": {"31622": "Optimism: An Essay (English) (as Author)", "12093": "The Song of the Stone Wall (English) (as Author)", "2397": "The Story of My Life\rWith her letters (1887-1901) and a supplementary account of her education, including passages from the reports and letters of her teacher, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, by John Albert Macy (English) (as Author)", "27683": "The World I Live In (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a895"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7ea"}, "authorname": "Kellogg Elijah", "books_info": {"48904": "Arthur Brown, The Young Captain\rThe Pleasant Cove Series (English) (as Author)", "51141": "Charlie Bell, The Waif of Elm Island (English) (as Author)", "54767": "The Hard-Scrabble of Elm Island (English) (as Author)", "50993": "Lion Ben of Elm IslandElm Island Stories (English) (as Author)", "54772": "The Turning of the Tide; Or, Radcliffe Rich and His Patients (English) (as Author)", "53738": "The Unseen Hand; or, James Renfew and His Boy Helpers (English) (as Author)", "49745": "The Young Deliverers of Pleasant CoveThe Pleasant Cove Series (English) (as Author)", "50475": "The Young Ship-Builders of Elm IslandElm Island Stories (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a45035"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7eb"}, "authorname": "Kellogg Vernon L.

Though a prolific poet whose works celebrated the common beauty of the natural world as well as his Roman Catholic religious faith, Kilmer was also a journalist, literary critic, lecturer, and editor.  While most of his works are largely unknown, a select few of his poems remain popular and are published frequently in anthologies.  Several critics\u2014including both Kilmer's contemporaries and modern scholars\u2014have disparaged Kilmer's work as being too simple and overly sentimental, and suggested that his style was far too traditional, even archaic.  Many writers, including notably Ogden Nash, have parodied Kilmer's work and style\u2014as attested by the many parodies of \"Trees\".\nAt the time of his deployment to Europe during World War I, Kilmer was considered the leading American Roman Catholic poet and lecturer of his generation, whom critics often compared to British contemporaries G. K. Chesterton (1874\u20131936) and Hilaire Belloc (1870\u20131953). He enlisted in the New York National Guard and was deployed to France with the 69th Infantry Regiment (the famous \"Fighting 69th\") in 1917.  He was killed by a sniper's bullet at the Second Battle of the Marne in 1918 at the age of 31. He was married to Aline Murray, also an accomplished poet and author, with whom he had five children."}, "literarymovements": ["poetry magazine"], "authornum": "a149"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7fa"}, "authorname": "King Basil", "books_info": {"9944": "The Conquest of Fear (English) (as Author)", "28590": "The Dust Flower (English) (as Author)", "35463": "The High Heart (English) (as Author)", "14393": "The Inner Shrine (English) (as Author)", "20443": "The Letter of the Contract (English) (as Author)", "30301": "The Side Of The Angels: A Novel (English) (as Author)", "14394": "The Street Called Straight (English) (as Author)", "13212": "The Wild Olive: A Novel (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a3214"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da7fb"}, "authorname": "King Charles", "books_info": {"19330": "An Apache Princess: A Tale of the Indian Frontier (English) (as Author)", "49320": "Cadet Days: A Story of West Point (English) (as Author)", "37480": "Campaigning with Crook, and Stories of Army Life (English) (as Author)", "19023": "A Daughter of the Sioux: A Tale of the Indian frontier (English) (as Author)", "16557": "The Deserter (English) (as Author)", "17806": "Foes in Ambush (English) (as Author)", "25884": "Found in the Philippines: The Story of a Woman's Letters (English) (as Author)", "37672": "From School to Battle-field: A Story of the War Days (English) (as Author)", "16558": "From the Ranks (English) (as Author)", "37244": "Kitty's Conquest (English) (as Author)", "19507": "Lanier of the Cavalry; or, A Week's Arrest (English) (as Author)", "31188": "\"Laramie;\" Or, The Queen of Bedlam.

His collected works represent, among other things, an extended reflection upon the dehumanising effects of modernity and industrialisation. Some of the issues Lawrence explores are sexuality, emotional health, vitality, spontaneity, and instinct.\nLawrence's opinions earned him many enemies and he endured official persecution, censorship, and misrepresentation of his creative work throughout the second half of his life, much of which he spent in a voluntary exile he called his \"savage pilgrimage\". At the time of his death, his public reputation was that of a pornographer who had wasted his considerable talents. E. M. Forster, in an obituary notice, challenged this widely held view, describing him as \"the greatest imaginative novelist of our generation.\" Later, the literary critic F. R. Leavis championed both his artistic integrity and his moral seriousness."}, "literarymovements": ["modernism"], "authornum": "a123"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da83f"}, "authorname": "Lawrence George A.

He is associated with the Fireside Poets, a group of New England writers who were among the first American poets that rivaled the popularity of British poets. These writers usually used conventional forms and meters in their poetry, making them suitable for families entertaining at their fireside.\nLowell graduated from Harvard College in 1838, despite his reputation as a troublemaker, and went on to earn a law degree from Harvard Law School. He published his first collection of poetry in 1841 and married Maria White in 1844. The couple had several children, though only one survived past childhood. They soon became involved in the movement to abolish slavery, with Lowell using poetry to express his anti-slavery views and taking a job in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the editor of an abolitionist newspaper. After moving back to Cambridge, Lowell was one of the founders of a journal called The Pioneer, which lasted only three issues. He gained notoriety in 1848 with the publication of A Fable for Critics, a book-length poem satirizing contemporary critics and poets. The same year, he published The Biglow Papers, which increased his fame. He went on to publish several other poetry collections and essay collections throughout his literary career.\nMaria died in 1853, and Lowell accepted a professorship of languages at Harvard in 1854; he continued to teach there for twenty years. He traveled to Europe before officially assuming his teaching duties in 1856, and married Frances Dunlap shortly thereafter in 1857. That year, Lowell also became editor of The Atlantic Monthly. It was not until 20 years later that he received his first political appointment, the ambassadorship to the Kingdom of Spain. He was later appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James's. He spent his last years in Cambridge in the same estate where he was born, and died there in 1891.\nLowell believed that the poet played an important role as a prophet and critic of society. He used poetry for reform, particularly in abolitionism. However, his commitment to the anti-slavery cause wavered over the years, as did his opinion on African-Americans. He attempted to emulate the true Yankee accent in the dialogue of his characters, particularly in The Biglow Papers. This depiction of the dialect, as well as his many satires, was an inspiration to writers such as Mark Twain and H. L. Mencken."}, "literarymovements": ["romanticism"], "authornum": "a456"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da89e"}, "authorname": "Lowell Percival", "books_info": {"47015": "Mars and Its Canals (English) (as Author)", "2605": "Noto: An Unexplored Corner of Japan (English) (as Author)", "1409": "The Soul of the Far East (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percival_Lowell"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a626"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da89f"}, "authorname": "Lowe Samuel E.

Marlowe was the foremost Elizabethan tragedian of his day. He greatly influenced William Shakespeare, who was born in the same year as Marlowe and who rose to become the pre-eminent Elizabethan playwright after Marlowe's mysterious early death. Marlowe's plays are known for the use of blank verse and their overreaching protagonists.\nSome scholars believe that a warrant was issued for Marlowe's arrest on 18 May 1593. No reason was given for it, though it was thought to be connected to allegations of blasphemy\u2014a manuscript believed to have been written by Marlowe was said to contain \"vile heretical conceipts\". On 20 May, he was brought to the court to attend upon the Privy Council for questioning. There is no record of their having met that day, however, and he was commanded to attend upon them each day thereafter until \"licensed to the contrary\".

Among his best known works are Typee (1846), a romantic account of his experiences of Polynesian life, and his whaling novel Moby-Dick (1851).\nMelville was born in New York City, the third child of a merchant who dealt in French dry goods and his wife. Years as a common sailor from 1839 to 1844 were the basis of his early writings. His first book was Typee (1846), a highly romanticized account of his life among Polynesians. It became such a best-seller that he wrote the sequel Omoo (1847). These successes gave him the financial basis to marry Elizabeth Shaw, daughter of a prominent Boston family, but the success proved hard to sustain. His first novel that was not based on his own experiences was Mardi (1849), a sea narrative that develops into a philosophical allegory\u2014but it was not well received. He received warmer reviews for Redburn (1849), a story of life on a merchant ship, and his 1850 description of the harsh life aboard a man-of-war in White-Jacket, but they did not provide financial security.\nMoby-Dick (1851), although now considered one of the great American novels, was not well received, and critics scorned his psychological novel, Pierre: or, The Ambiguities (1852). From 1853 to 1856, Melville published short fiction in magazines, most notably \"Bartleby, the Scrivener\" (1853), \"The Encantadas\" (1854), and \"Benito Cereno\" (1855). These and three other stories were collected in 1856 as The Piazza Tales. In 1857, he traveled to England and then toured the Near East. The Confidence-Man (1857) was the last prose work that he published. He moved to New York to take a position as Customs Inspector and turned to poetry. Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866) was his poetic reflection on the moral questions of the American Civil War.\nIn 1867, his oldest child Malcolm died at home from a self-inflicted gunshot. Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land was published in 1876, a metaphysical epic. In 1886, his son Stanwix died, and Melville retired. During his last years, he privately published two volumes of poetry, left one volume unpublished, and returned to prose of the sea. The novella Billy Budd was left unfinished at his death but was published in 1924. Melville's death from cardiovascular disease in 1891 subdued a reviving interest in his work. The 1919 centennial of his birth became the starting point of the \"Melville Revival\". Critics discovered his work, scholars explored his life; his major novels and stories have come to be considered world classics, and his poetry has gradually gained respect."}, "literarymovements": ["tall tale", "travel literature", "allegory", "gothic romanticism", "captivity narrative", "sea story", "romanticism"], "authornum": "a9"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da93d"}, "authorname": "Melville Lewis", "books_info": {"39980": "Farmer George, Volume 1 (English) (as Author)", "39981": "Farmer George, Volume 2 (English) (as Author)", "10590": "Lady Mary Wortley Montague, Her Life and Letters (1689-1762) (English) (as Author)", "13790": "Life And Letters Of John Gay (1685-1732), Author of \"The Beggar's Opera\" (English) (as Author)", "50606": "Some Eccentrics & a Woman (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a3588"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094da93e"}, "authorname": "Mencken H.

He was also a noted archaeologist and historian, and an important figure in the history of architectural preservation. He is best known for his novella Carmen, which became the basis of Bizet's opera Carmen. He learned Russian and translated the work of several important Russian writers, including Pushkin and Gogol, into French. From 1830 until 1860 he was the inspector of French historical monuments, and was responsible for the protection of many historic sites, including the medieval citadel of Carcassonne, and the restoration of the fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. Along with the writer George Sand, he discovered the series of tapestries The Lady and the Unicorn, and arranged for their preservation.

He is regarded as national poet in Poland, Lithuania and Belarus. A principal figure in Polish Romanticism, he is counted  as one of Poland's \"Three Bards\" (\"Trzej Wieszcze\") and is widely regarded as Poland's greatest poet. He is also considered one of the greatest Slavic and European poets and has been dubbed a \"Slavic bard\". A leading Romantic dramatist, he has been compared in Poland and Europe to Byron and Goethe.He is known chiefly for the poetic drama Dziady (Forefathers' Eve) and the national epic poem Pan Tadeusz. His other influential works include Konrad Wallenrod and Gra\u017cyna. All these served as inspiration for uprisings against the three imperial powers that had partitioned the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth out of existence.\nMickiewicz was born in the Russian-partitioned territories of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which had been part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and was active in the struggle to win independence for his home region.  After, as a consequence, spending five years exiled to central Russia, in 1829 he succeeded in leaving the Russian Empire and, like many of his compatriots, lived out the rest of his life abroad.  He settled first in Rome, then in Paris, where for a little over three years he lectured on Slavic literature at the Coll\u00e8ge de France.

He was a contemporary of the older Virgil and Horace, with whom he is often ranked as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature. The Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. He enjoyed enormous popularity, but, in one of the mysteries of literary history, was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes his exile to carmen et error, \"a poem and a mistake\", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars.\nThe first major Roman poet to begin his career during the reign of Augustus, Ovid is today best known for the Metamorphoses, a 15-book continuous mythological narrative written in the meter of epic, and for works in elegiac couplets such as Ars Amatoria (\"The Art of Love\") and Fasti. His poetry was much imitated during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and greatly influenced Western art and literature. The Metamorphoses remains one of the most important sources of classical mythology."}, "literarymovements": ["elegy", "epic poetry", "drama"], "authornum": "a2868"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094daa0a"}, "authorname": "Ovington Mary White", "books_info": {"39742": "Half a Man: The Status of the Negro in New York (English) (as Author)", "58719": "How the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Began (English) (as Author)", "33101": "The Shadow (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_White_Ovington"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a36204"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094daa0b"}, "authorname": "Owen Catherine", "books_info": {"26311": "Choice Cookery (English) (as Author)", "29982": "Culture and Cooking; Or, Art in the Kitchen (English) (as Author)", "46144": "Six Cups of Coffee\rPrepared for the Public Palate by the Best Authorities on Coffee Making (English) (as Author)", "49521": "Ten Dollars Enough: Keeping House Well on Ten Dollars a Week\rHow It Has Been Done; How It May Be Done Again (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a31905"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094daa0c"}, "authorname": "Oxenford John", "books_info": {"49882": "A Day Well Spent: A Farce, in One Act (English) (as Author)", "49296": "Retained for the Defence: A Farce, in One Act (English) (as Author)", "49481": "Twice Killed: A Farce in One Act (English) (as Author)"}, "wiki_info": {"en": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Oxenford"}, "authorabstracts": {}, "literarymovements": [], "authornum": "a4723"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6218936c7d25094daa0d"}, "authorname": "Oxenham John", "books_info": {"27126": "'All's Well!'

His rediscovery of Cicero's letters is often credited with inventing the 14th-century Renaissance. Petrarch is often considered the founder of Humanism. In the 16th century, Pietro Bembo created the model for the modern Italian language based on Petrarch's works, as well as those of Giovanni Boccaccio, and, to a lesser extent, Dante Alighieri. Petrarch would be later endorsed as a model for Italian style by the Accademia della Crusca.\nPetrarch's sonnets were admired and imitated throughout Europe during the Renaissance and became a model for lyrical poetry.

He has historically been regarded as a writer of fantasy, satire, the grotesque, bawdy jokes and songs. His best known work is Gargantua and Pantagruel. Because of his literary power and historical importance, Western literary critics consider him one of the great writers of world literature and among the creators of modern European writing.

Among his best-known work is The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's. He was a regular and prolific contributor to The Boy's Own Paper (B.O.P.), in which most of his fiction first appeared. Through his family's business, Reed became a prominent typefounder, and wrote a standard work on the subject: History of the Old English Letter Foundries.\nReed's father, Charles Reed, was a successful London printer who later became a Member of Parliament (MP). Talbot attended the City of London School before leaving at 17 to join the family business in Fann Street. His literary career began in 1879, when the B.O.P. was launched. The family were staunchly Christian, pillars of the Congregational Church, and were heavily involved in charitable works. However, Reed did not use his writing as a vehicle for moralising, and was dismissive of those early school story writers who did, such as Dean Farrar. Reed's affinity with boys, his instinctive understanding of their standpoint in life and his gift for creating believable characters, ensured that his popularity survived through several generations. He was widely imitated by other writers in the school story genre.\nIn 1881, following the death of his father, Reed became head of the company. By then he had begun his monumental  history which was published in 1887. Along with his B.O.P. contributions Reed wrote regular articles and book reviews for his cousin Edward Baines's newspaper, the Leeds Mercury. He was  a co-founder and first honorary secretary of the Bibliographical Society,  and   a trustee for his family's charities. All this activity may have undermined his health; after struggling with illness for most of 1893, Reed died in November that year, at the age of 41. Tributes honoured him both for his contribution to children's fiction and for his work as the definitive historian of English typefounding."}, "literarymovements": ["children's literature"], "authornum": "a9657"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6219936c7d25094daaab"}, "authorname": "Rees Arthur J.

A radical in his poetry as well as in his political and social views, Shelley did not see fame during his lifetime, but recognition of his achievements in poetry grew steadily following his death. Shelley was a key member of a close circle of visionary poets and writers that included Lord Byron, John Keats, Leigh Hunt, Thomas Love Peacock, and his own second wife, Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein.\nShelley is perhaps best known for classic poems such as \"Ozymandias\", \"Ode to the West Wind\", \"To a Skylark\", \"Music, When Soft Voices Die\", \"The Cloud\", and \"The Masque of Anarchy\". His other major works include a groundbreaking verse drama The Cenci (1819) and long, visionary, philosophical poems such as Queen Mab (later reworked as The Daemon of the World), Alastor, The Revolt of Islam, Adona\u00efs, Prometheus Unbound (1820)\u2014widely considered to be his masterpiece\u2014Hellas: A Lyrical Drama (1821), and his final, unfinished work, The Triumph of Life (1822).\nShelley's close circle of friends included some of the most important progressive thinkers of the day, including his father-in-law, the philosopher William Godwin, and Leigh Hunt. Though Shelley's poetry and prose output remained steady throughout his life, most publishers and journals declined to publish his work for fear of being arrested for either blasphemy or sedition. Shelley's poetry sometimes had only an underground readership during his day, but his poetic achievements are widely recognized today, and his political and social thought had an impact on the Chartist and other movements in England, and reach down to the present day. Shelley's theories of economics and morality, for example, had a profound influence on Karl Marx; his early\u2014perhaps first\u2014writings on nonviolent resistance influenced Leo Tolstoy, whose writings on the subject in turn influenced Mahatma Gandhi, and through him Martin Luther King Jr. and others practicing nonviolence during the American civil rights movement.\nShelley became a lodestar to the subsequent three or four generations of poets, including important Victorian and Pre-Raphaelite poets such as Robert Browning and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. He was admired by Oscar Wilde, Thomas Hardy, George Bernard Shaw, Leo Tolstoy, Bertrand Russell, W. B. Yeats, Upton Sinclair and Isadora Duncan. Henry David Thoreau's Civil Disobedience was apparently influenced by Shelley's writings and theories on non-violence in protest and political action. Shelley's popularity and influence has continued to grow in contemporary poetry circles."}, "literarymovements": ["romanticism"], "authornum": "a1529"}, {"_id": {"$oid": "5cba6219936c7d25094dab62"}, "authorname": "Sheridan Philip Henry", "books_info": {"4546": "Memoirs of the Union's Three Great Civil War Generals (English) (as Author)", "4362": "Personal Memoirs of P.

Born in the Allegheny West neighborhood of Pittsburgh, and raised in Oakland, California, Stein moved to Paris in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris salon, where the leading figures of modernism in literature and art, such as Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Ezra Pound, Sherwood Anderson and Henri Matisse, would meet.In 1933, Stein published a quasi-memoir of her Paris years, The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, written in the voice of Alice B. Toklas, her life partner. The book became a literary bestseller and vaulted Stein from the relative obscurity of the cult-literature scene into the limelight of mainstream attention. Two quotes from her works have become widely known: \"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose,\" and \"there is no there there\", with the latter often taken to be a reference to her childhood home of Oakland.\nHer books include Q.E.D. (1903), about a lesbian romantic affair involving several of Stein's friends, Fernhurst, a fictional story about a love triangle, Three Lives (1905\u201306), and The Making of Americans (1902\u20131911). In Tender Buttons (1914), Stein commented on lesbian sexuality.Her activities during World War II have been the subject of analysis and commentary. As a Jew living in Nazi-occupied France, Stein may have only been able to sustain her lifestyle as an art collector, and indeed to ensure her physical safety, through the protection of the powerful Vichy government official and Nazi collaborator Bernard Fa\u00ff.

These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus, in 14 AD, to the years of the First Jewish\u2013Roman War, in 70 AD. There are substantial lacunae in the surviving texts, including a gap in the Annals that is four books long.\nTacitus' other writings discuss oratory (in dialogue format, see Dialogus de oratoribus), Germania (in De origine et situ Germanorum), and the life of his father-in-law, Agricola, the general responsible for much of the Roman conquest of Britain, mainly focusing on his campaign in Britannia (De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae).\nTacitus is considered to be one of the greatest Roman historians.

He reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse\" of Gitanjali, he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his \"elegant prose and magical poetry\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He is sometimes referred to as \"the Bard of Bengal\".A Brhamo from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bh\u0101nusi\u1e43ha (\"Sun Lion\"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent anti-nationalist, he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy also endures in the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University.Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed\u2014or panned\u2014for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation.

He wrote three of the most famous poems in Latin literature: the Eclogues (or Bucolics), the Georgics, and the epic Aeneid. A number of minor poems, collected in the Appendix Vergiliana, are sometimes attributed to him.Virgil is traditionally ranked as one of Rome's greatest poets. His Aeneid has been considered the national epic of ancient Rome since the time of its composition. Modeled after Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, the Aeneid follows the Trojan refugee Aeneas as he struggles to fulfill his destiny and reach Italy, where his descendants Romulus and Remus were to found the city of Rome.

Westlake is perhaps best-remembered for creating two professional criminal characters who each starred in a long-running series: the relentless, hard-boiled Parker (published under the pen name Richard Stark), and John Dortmunder who featured in a more humorous series.\nHe was a three-time Edgar Award winner, and alongside Joe Gores and William L. DeAndrea was one of few writers to win Edgars in three different categories (1968, Best Novel, God Save the Mark; 1990, Best Short Story, \"Too Many Crooks\"; 1991, Best Motion Picture Screenplay, The Grifters).
