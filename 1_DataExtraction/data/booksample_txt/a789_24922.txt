Ha!	"Ha!"	began Jack, staring.	And so, having presently summoned a coach (for Jack's foot was become too swollen for the stirrup), we all three of us got in and were driven to the Manor.	"Faith!"	"I do not doubt it for a moment, sir," says Mr. Tawnish, "but these were written, if you remember, to--the lady."	"But bethink you, Dick," says Bentley flushing, "he had never so much as seen her and, when he heard we were all so set on having him married, he writ me saying he 'preferred a wife of his own choosing' and then--well, he bolted!"	"Yes," says I, from the window, gazing across the bleak, grey desolation of the park.	"And now," says he, "suppose we have a hand at picquet."	"Egad!"	Ha!	"Cannot go on--the devil, sir!"	"Why, to be sure," says I, readily, "'twas an accident.	"On the grounds that mine is the prior claim to the sword of Sir Harry Raikes."	How think you, Dick?"	One who will not faint if a dog bark too loudly, nor shiver at sight of a pistol, nor pick his way ever by smooth roads.	"Yes," says Pen, "and Saladin's such a quiet old horse as a rule!"	and then suddenly in a louder tone: "Off with them!"	"As for you, sir," says she, "you stole away my letter,--was that gentle, was it loving, was it kind?	"I'll see you hanged for this," said Raikes, betwixt his teeth.	"Why--er--no," stammered Bentley, "but you see, Pen--" "Then, Sir John," she continued, with her calm, reproving gaze still fixed upon her father's face the while he fidgetted in his chair, "then yesterday, Sir John, when I found you'd taken it, and came to demand it back again, you heard me coming and slipped out--through the window, and hid yourself--in the stables, and rode away without even stopping to put on your riding-boots, and--in that terrible old hat!	"Such very small, pink fingers!"	"What can we do?"	"That settles it!"	To my mind, 'tis but a cloak to mask his cowardice,   as you will both doubtless agree when you shall have read this note.	"Jack," says I, as I rejoined him, "you will fight with your back to the door, though there is little difference save that the wall is a trifle lighter there, and will make you less conspicuous."	I heard some talk that he had won a thousand or so from young Vesey, by this one bout alone."	Lord!	says Bentley.	But at this moment, as luck would have it, Bentley reappeared, nor was I ever more glad to see him.	'My pretty maid!'	"Which I take leave to doubt," says I, sourly, "or he would have fallen in with our wishes and married Pen a year ago, instead of running away like a craven fool!"	CHAPTER FIVE           _Concerning the true Identity of our Highwayman_ 'Twas some half-hour later that we found Jack in his library, seated before the fire, his wine at his elbow and Pen at his feet, reading aloud from Mr. Steele's "Tatler."	"Nor I!"	So, my dear Sir John, in hopes of soon gaining your esteem and   blessing (above all), I rest your most devoted, humble, obedient,                             HORATIO TAWNISH.	"Did Jack tell thee all that?"	"Humph!"	says Jack.	"And what's more, he's a fine lad, a lovable lad, and a very fine gentleman into the bargain, as you will be the first to admit when--" but here Bentley broke off to turn and look at me mighty solemn all at once: "Dick," says he, "do you think young Raikes is so great a swordsman as they say?"	"Sir Harry Raikes," says I, stepping up to his stirrup, "you will notice that I have here a sword and a whip--which shall it be?"	"Aye, but I shall!"	A child has teething-rash!--'A clyster!	"And 'twas you caught the bridle, now, wasn't it?"	"Dick," says Bentley, in my ear, speaking in a strange, uneven voice, such as I had never heard from his lips before, while Jack busied himself untying his cravat--"Dick, they must not--shall not fight," and I saw that the sweat stood out in great drops upon his brow.	"For what, Dick?"	"What I says," returned the other, with a flourish of his pistols, "such being my natur', d'ye take me?	Raikes is a dangerous fellow and generally pinks his man, sir."	"Aye, Tawnish!"	"No!	"But now," says I after a while, "the time is come to be resolute, for her sake--and her mother's."	We must be stern to be kind."	says Bentley, staring like a fool, "Jack--ah yes, to be sure--to be sure."	"Well, but where's his meaning?	And thus it has ever been--for her dead mother's sake!"	"One!"	"You possibly allude to my friend Sir John Chester," I corrected.	Here," he continued, tossing a folded paper on the table in front of Bentley, "it seems the young rascal's been meeting her--over the orchard wall.	"Sir John," says Mr. Tawnish, bowing across the table, "allow me to suggest in the most humble and submissive manner, that the word 'persecution' is perhaps a trifle--I say just a trifle--unwarranted."	"This was the first great sorrow of my life--that by my happiness you two were rendered desolate," says he, laying his hand upon my shoulder.	As he ended, he helped himself to another pinch of snuff with a pretty, delicate air such as a lady would use in taking a comfit; indeed his hand, small and elegantly shaped, whose whiteness was accentuated by the emerald and ruby ring upon his finger, needed no very strong effort of fancy to be taken for a woman's outright.	CHAPTER THREE           _Of a Flight of Steps, a Stirrup, and a Stone_ Autumn, with its dying flowers and falling leaves, is, to my thinking, a mournful season, and hath ever about it a haunting melancholy, a gentle sadness that sorts very ill with this confounded tune of "Lillibuleero," more especially when whistled in gusts and somewhat out of key.	"Uncle Bentley!"	"Indeed, gentlemen," says Mr. Tawnish, glancing at his memoranda with a slight frown, "I think the labours of Hercules were scarce to be compared to these, yet I do not altogether despair, and to prove to you my readiness in the matter, I will, with your permission, go and set about the doing of them."	says Bentley, pointing to the letter--"look at the blots."	"We must be harsh," says I, "if need be and--" But here, perceiving Bentley's face to be screwed up warningly, observing his ponderous wink and eloquent thumb, I glanced up and beheld Penelope herself regarding us from the doorway.	says Bentley, scratching his chin, and presently sets off towards the house, whistling lustily.	They were still howling with laughter, and Bentley's face had already assumed a bluish tinge, when the door opened and a servant appeared, who handed a letter to Jack.	"Curse it, Dick!"	"I say he shouldn't marry her now, no--not if he were ten thousand times Bentley's nephew, sir--deuce take him!"	I nodded, and spreading out the paper I read (with no little difficulty) as follows:   DEAR DICK AND BENTLEY,   Come round and see me at once, for the devil anoint me if I ever   heard tell the like on't, and more especially after the exhibition   of a week ago.	says Bentley, "why--egad, Pen--" "And Uncle Dick caught father as he fell," she continued.	"Yes, Sir John dear."	"Mr. Bentley," says he, with a flourish of his hat, "I fancy 'twould be as well for Sir Richard were I and Captain Hammersley to ride on before, yet do not loose him till I am out of sight, I beg."	The duel had been settled for twelve o'clock, and it was exactly half after eleven by my chronometer when a servant came to warn us that the coach was at the door.	"By God, you don't, Dick!"	"Humph!"	[Illustration: "Oh!	"So they tell me," nodded Mr. Tawnish, jotting down a few lines in his memorandum.	cried Jack, "the jade!"	exclaimed the Captain, glancing about apprehensively, while I stared at Bentley in surprise, for this was the first I had heard of it.	"Checkmate!"	And if the gentleman in the muddy hat moves a finger nearer his barkers, I'll blow his head off--curse me if I won't."	And you, Uncle Bentley, what have you to say?"
