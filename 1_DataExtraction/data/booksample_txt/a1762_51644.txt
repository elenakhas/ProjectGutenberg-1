Oh, how I understand her--Carmen!--_fruit défendu_ attracted her so--the beautiful, wicked, fascinating snake.	_Thursday night, Nov. 24th._ “Now that you have embarked upon this,” Lady Ver said, when I ventured into her sitting-room, hearing no voices, about six o’clock (Mr. Carruthers had left me at the door, at the end of our walk, and I had been with the angels at tea ever since), “Now that you have embarked upon this opera, I say, you will have to dine at Willis’s with us.	But she looked so charming, and I felt a little proud, and perhaps ashamed to show that I am very much interested in Lord Robert, especially if he belongs to her, whatever that means, and so I said it was a bargain, and of course I had never thought of playing with him, but when I came to reflect afterwards, that is a promise, I suppose, and I sha’n’t be able to look at him any more under my eyelashes.	“CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE.	Has some one been unkind to you--tell me, tell me,” his voice was trembling with distress.	Even he might have been better than the botanist, but I suppose Lady Katherine felt these two would be a kind of half mourning for me.	Oh!	“I have searched for you all over the place.” “You do not know it all yet, or you would have found me,” I said, pretending to walk on.	Well, I think it is very probable his fears will be realized, as I shall be in London,” said Lord Robert.	“Forgive me, Anderson,” she said, humbly, “you were saying?” “Campion has thrown me over,” glared Mr. Montgomerie.	I WONDER how I lived before I met Robert.	She was sure it would amuse me, it so amused her--but it made me a teeny bit remember the story of the boys and the frogs!	“What others have you to bring forward as to why you can’t marry me in a fortnight?” I was silent--I did not know how to say it--the principal reason of all.	“What am I to do, Katherine?” he said, presently; “that confounded fellow Campion has thrown me over for next week, and he is my best gun: at short notice like this, it’s impossible to replace him with the same class of shot.” “Yes, dear,” said Lady Katherine, in that kind of voice that has not heard the question--she was deep in her own letters.	_Tuesday night_ IT is quite late, nearly twelve o’clock, but I feel so wide awake I must write.	“You are perfectly beautiful--slender, stately, exquisite tiger-lily--only--only--you don’t look cold--and it is just your red hair, and those fascinating green eyes, and your white lovely skin and black eyelashes that, that--oh!	And nothing could have been more smooth and silent than the service.	About eighteen hundred a year, I suppose, and you know, darling boy, you are often in debt.	“I was suddenly put on guard yesterday, and could not get leave,” he said, not answering the first part.	I have a big armchair and books, and this, my journal, and all is cosy--only I feel so miserable.	Shall I marry Mr. Carruthers?	I can’t bear it.	But oh!	The world looked wet and bleak outside.	LADY MERRENDEN is so nice--one of those kind faces that even a tight fringe in a net does not spoil.	I was watching you!	CLARIDGE’S,   _Monday afternoon_.	I sniffed at him, and was as disagreeable as could be.	The blue tea-gown, with the pink roses, and the lace cap, and the bad cold were not for nothing.	Lady Ver evidently knows much better about it than Mary Mackintosh, although she does not talk in that way.	“Why are you so capricious?” he asked.	those dams!” I burst out, not thinking for a moment--then I stopped, remembering.	I have played with so many.” Then she roused herself up.	“Little cat!” but she wasn’t angry.	His face was disturbed.	All the time I was conscious that Lord Robert was fidgeting and playing with a china cow that was on a table near, and just before the butler announced Mrs. Fairfax, he dropped it on the floor, and broke its tail off.	Should she run on, and stop the young ladies?	To-morrow Mrs. Mackintosh, the eldest daughter, is arriving with her four children.	Mr. Barton was waiting patiently for us in the white drawing-room, and we had not been munching muffins for five minutes when the sound of wheels crunching the gravel of the great sweep--the windows of this room look out that way--interrupted our manufactured conversation.	“Hello, Bob!” said Mr. Carruthers, cheerfully.	“That is not the least consequence--we are almost related.	Even his self-appreciation did not deserve such a blow as this!	He grew exasperated.	“Now you are going to tell me everything about it,” he commanded.	They were waiting for us just inside the door, and again I noticed that they were both lovely creatures, and both exceptionally distinguished looking.	“Now, isn’t it?” replied Lord Robert.	_Oh!	“Have they?” “Lady Ver said no husband could do that--the fact of there being one kept your heart quite quiet, and often made you yawn--but she said it was not necessary, as long as you could make theirs, so that they would do all you asked.” “Then do women’s hearts never beat--did she tell you?” “Of course they beat!	No look more kind could be expressed in a human countenance than is expressed in hers.	He is violently in love with you for the moment, and he wants to marry you because he cannot obtain you on any other terms.” “You are flattering,” I said, rather hurt.	Shall send this up by  express, you will get it in time for the 4 train.	Then I rang the bell, and had it sent by a messenger in a cab, who was to wait for an answer.	He came over, and forcibly took my hand.	I am sure any one would be terribly shocked to read what I have written, but not so much if they knew Robert, and how utterly adorable he is.	It was from Lady Katherine Montgomerie.	“Evangeline, I was so angry with you yesterday,” he said, “I very nearly left London, and abandoned you to your fate, but now that I have seen you again----” he paused.	“You might give me away at my wedding,” I said, gaily.	She has tact!	“Charlie has just wired he comes back to-night,” she announced at length.	You will catch cold in the damp.” “Oh no, not yet.	I would rather be anything in the world than married to that!	I am only telling you everything, so that we may consult how best to act.” “Yes, I know,” I said, and I squeezed her hand again; she does not put out claws like Lady Ver.	I shall have them reset by Cartier.	I settled myself more comfortably on the velvet cushions.	They looked all round at the dead-daffodil-coloured cretonne and things, and at last I could see their eyes often straying to my night-gown and dressing-gown, laid out on a chair beside the fire.	God knows what has come between us since--it is not of my doing--but I want to take care of you, dear little girl to-day.	Oh, dear!	It was getting almost dusk, and suddenly I felt tired, and sat down on a bench.	She did seem surprised.	Mr. Carruthers stood quite still, and put his light back on the table.	“You can marry me, and I will take you to Paris, or where you want, and I won’t order you about,--only I shall keep the other beasts of men from looking at you.” But I told him at once I thought that would be very dull.	“I could not get away, I do not know what possessed Christopher, he would sample ports, and talked the hind leg off a donkey, till at last I said to him straight out I wanted to come to you.	There is a misty fog.	Tea was a pandemonium!	The lace, too, will suit me, and the sables, and I shall have the suite that Mrs. Carruthers used at Branches done up with pale green, and burn all the Early Victorians.	That next day after I last wrote, it poured with rain, and every one came down cross to breakfast.	Sir Charles seemed bored and uncomfortable; he kissed his three exquisite bits of Dresden china, so like, and yet unlike himself--they have Lady Ver’s complexion, but brown eyes and golden hair like him.	“Mademoiselle is doubtless _fiancée_ to Mr. Carruthers.	And how masterful, and simple, and direct!	tell me, tell me what is it.	Lord Robert was stroking the hair of the eldest angel, who had not gone to bed.	She says Lady Verningham is not engaged to-night, she knows, and we might dine quietly, and all go, don’t you think so?” Lord Robert said he would, but he added, “Miss Travers would never come out before; she said she was in too deep mourning.” He seemed aggrieved.	“Now I think we have demolished all your silly little reasons for making me miserable,” he said.
