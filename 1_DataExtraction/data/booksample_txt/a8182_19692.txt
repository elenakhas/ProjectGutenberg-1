Section 3.	Some Englishmen are always having rows about this window question; but the best plan is to say nothing, and remember that every country has its own customs, which strangers ought to observe.	It is all flat, with canals, and long, straight roads, paved with stones, running across it.	Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at http://pglaf.org/fundraising.	When a child is born, the parents should send to all their friends a box of _dragees_--that is, sugared almonds or sugar-plums.	Next morning the children wake early, and jump out of bed to see what has happened during the night.	That is Flemish, their language, and it means: "Happy night, oh, happy night!	There are prizes for those who build the best castles, and it is curious to see hundreds of little Belgian, English, French, and German flags flying on these small forts, and to hear the children shouting to each other in so many different languages.	This was tidings of great joy to the Belgians; but England would not allow the Treaty of Münster to be torn up in this way, and a war began between England and France, which lasted till the fall of Napoleon in 1814.	This, it is thought, will make them bear next year.	A broad channel led from the sea to Bruges, and ships entered daily laden with goods from every country in Europe, as well as from India and all parts of the world.	Cricket has lately been tried, but it has not as yet spread much, and is not likely to become very popular, as it requires too much patience and steadiness for Belgian young men and boys.	The King never went there himself, but both he and his friends, who were also making money, said that the English (for it was the English who found most fault with him) were jealous, and that everything was going well.	The son of this marriage was Charles V., who was neither mad nor handsome, but one of the most famous men in history.	One, which they call _balle dans la maison_ (ball in the house), is much the same as rounders, and there is another game called _camp ruine_, which girls play at school.	The tall houses with their projecting wooden gables were gay with flags.	The custom is for all members of the family to wear new clothes on the day of a _Première Communion_, but the child's dress is the important thing.	There is another of these rhymes which is not so polite, in which the saint is told that if he gives something, the child will serve him for life, but if he doesn't, the child will not serve him at all!	This village belonged to a fierce robber, called Hacco, and it was at his door that the pilgrims knocked.	It is crossed, a long way up, by slender spars, like the yards of a ship, only they are no thicker than a walking-stick.	Their houses were full of precious stones, tapestries, silk, fine linen, and cloth of gold.	When you wander about among the towns of Flanders and Brabant you might think that the whole of Belgium was one level plain.	The drawing generally takes place in the _Hotel de Ville_ of the chief town in the part of the country to which the boys belong.	They first set their affections on a son of Louis Philippe, the King of France, and asked him to be their King.	The shooting takes place in a hall, where a supper-table is laid with various dishes of ham, salads, fish, and other eatables.	The French now declared the Scheldt a free river, to be used by all nations.	Two years ago, in the summer of 1907, there was a pageant at Bruges, when the marriage festivities of Charles the Bold and Margaret of York were represented.	In the bull's-eye of the target there is the figure of an ape, and if anyone hits that he can eat of any dish he pleases.	The spectators laugh and clap their hands, and the village children scream with delight.	In the long run England and France managed to persuade the others that the best thing was to let the Belgians have their own way, and choose a King for themselves.	All Belgian children, even those whose parents are not Catholics, go, with scarcely an exception, to first Communion, and are confirmed, for there may be relatives with money to leave, and they must not be displeased.	By going there you will get a far better idea of the family life of those times than by reading any number of story-books or looking at any number of pictures.	They lent money to Kings and Princes, and lived themselves in almost royal luxury.	The part of this forest nearest the town is called the _Bois de la Cambre_, which is a favourite place for walking and riding in.	The golf-course at this place is laid out among the dunes, and is entirely natural, with "bunkers" of fine sand.	Hacco and the robbers run after him, scrambling about among bushes and trees, as if they were playing at hide-and-seek.

They all go to church in the morning, and the rest of the day is given up to play.	CHAPTER IX THE STORY OF ST. EVERMAIRE: A COUNTRY PAGEANT Once upon a time there was a good man called St. Evermaire, who went on a pilgrimage to a part of Belgium called the Hesbaye, which is near the River Meuse.

It is about the children of the _bonne bourgeoisie_ that I am going to speak, for they are a very numerous class, and their customs are in many respects the same as those of most Belgians.	The commonest name, however, for girls is Marie, a name given in honour of the Virgin Mary, to whom many baby girls are devoted from their birth.	They took this advice, and in 1831 he accepted the offer they made him, and was crowned at Brussels as Leopold I., King of the Belgians.	So on the Eve of St. Nicholas Belgian children, before they go to bed, fill their shoes, or sometimes a basket, with hay or carrots, and place them near the chimney of their sleeping-room, so that when St. Nicholas comes to the house he may find something for his donkey or horse to eat, and in return leave presents for them.	It stands on an eminence overlooking the lower part of the town, and is so huge that it may almost be said to make the capital of this tiny kingdom look top-heavy.	They can put on their parents' clothes, and go about the house making as much noise as they like, teasing the servants and giving them orders.	There are two sides.	The priests have so much influence, and work so hard at the elections, that, except in Brussels, Liege, and a few more places, the people are frightened to vote against them.	If a candle or lamp goes out suddenly on Christmas Eve, it is believed that someone in the room will die soon.	At last a day came when a certain Count of Flanders died, leaving no heir male, and a Duke of Burgundy, called Philip the Hardy, married a Flemish Princess, and obtained possession of Flanders.	They don't wait to be offered money; they ask for it, like common street-beggars asking alms.	In front of each cottage there is a pathway of rough stones, and a gutter full of dirty water.	In order to keep up this force of 40,000 it is necessary to find about 13,000 new men each year.	It is said that once upon a time, when the moon was shining brightly through the open stonework of the tower, the people thought there was a fire, and tried to put it out with water!	CHAPTER XII THE ARCHERS: GAMES PLAYED IN BELGIUM Let us imagine we are taking a walk along some country road in Flanders on a summer afternoon.	It is quite common in Belgium to be in a railway carriage where, when the guard comes round, all the passengers pull out season tickets.	The more shots he fires the more she thinks he loves her, and to reward him she ought to hide a bottle of gin in some corner outside the house, from which he can drink her health.	There are very few shells to gather; but there are no dangerous rocks or slippery places, and children can wade about and play in perfect safety.	There are those of the highest rank, who are called the _grande_, or _vraie, noblesse_.	Through the streets, between crowds of people standing on the pavements or looking down from the windows--while the church bells ring, and wreaths of incense fill the air, bands of music, squadrons of cavalry, crucifixes, shrines, images, the banners of the parishes, heralds in their varied dresses, bareheaded pilgrims from England, France, and other countries, maidens in white, bearing palms or crowns of thorn or garlands--priests and chanting choristers, move slowly along, and, when the relic of the Holy Blood passes, all the people sink to the ground.	He not only ruled over the Netherlands, as Belgium and Holland were called, but also over Spain, and all the immense Spanish Empire, and was, moreover, Emperor of Germany.	Thus, in little Belgium there are not only three different languages, but various ways of speaking Flemish, the original language of the country.	They are followed by about fifty men on horseback, dressed up as Hacco and his band of robbers.	Belgian families often go there to spend the summer afternoons.	There would be constant rows, and no match would ever be finished.

The rooms in these public-houses are pretty large, but they get dreadfully hot and stuffy.	In the belfry there was a famous bell called "Roland," and if any of their rulers attempted to tax them against their will, this Roland was rung, and wagged his iron tongue so well that the townsmen armed themselves at once, and the tax-gatherers were driven away.

The village street is full of stalls covered with cheap toys, sweetmeats, and all sorts of tempting little articles, and you may be sure the pennies melt away very quickly.	Suppose there are 150 boys, and 50 are wanted for the army, then those who draw the 50 lowest numbers are those who have to serve.	The commonest name, however, for girls is Marie, a name given in honour of the Virgin Mary, to whom many baby girls are devoted from their birth.	On Christmas Day in Flanders people wish each other "A Merry Christmas," just as they do in England; and many parents of the upper classes send their children, in charge of a servant, to visit their relatives, from whom they may receive some small gifts.	The children are confirmed on the Monday, the day after their first Communion, and are then taken to visit the friends of the family to be shown off, and to receive presents.	They always seem to be in good humour with each other and with themselves.	So on the Eve of St. Nicholas Belgian children, before they go to bed, fill their shoes, or sometimes a basket, with hay or carrots, and place them near the chimney of their sleeping-room, so that when St. Nicholas comes to the house he may find something for his donkey or horse to eat, and in return leave presents for them.	In Belgium the fathers and mothers of the _petite bourgeoisie_, or lower-middle class, seem always to go about on holidays with their children.	The railway passes close in front of them.
