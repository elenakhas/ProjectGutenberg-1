She remembered the queer way the partly buried briefcase had resisted her first tug, like a rooted plant.	They think of us as devils who will some day return through the door to destroy them.	I inhabit the disguised and jetless spaceship which is your Earth."	In some manner they successfully camouflage their ships.	*       *       *       *       * _The other gods_, Dotty dreamt, _are combing the whole Universe for us.	Then he lifted the scotch-and-soda in his clawlike hand and took a satisfying swallow.	There are roughly four of those items, as I see it.	"That about winds up the story for the present.	Edmund had turned his back on the window.	She felt cowed by the mysterious night about her, and literally dwarfed, as if she had grown several inches shorter.	*       *       *       *       * Edmund rapped for attention.	"Nearer thirty, I believe," Edmund answered, "and still going down."	Theodor lost a step.	We'll be late."	Where am I to find it?"	But I don't know that any of them have ever suggested that the Earth, together with all the planets and moons of the Solar System, might be...." In a whisper, Frieda finished for him, "... a camouflaged fleet of gigantic spherical spaceships."	She expected blackness, but it was as if the light of the path stayed with her, making a little glow all around.	Edmund waited.	"No, just Frieda's," Celeste said bitterly.	It resists their hardest drills, their strongest corrosives.	As the poem was ending, Celeste saw the door open and Rosalind come slowly in.	She thought, _he'd just have had time to scribble that note on his briefcase and toss it away._ She jerked off a glove, leaned out as far as she could, and made a frantic effort to drive its fingers into the powdery path.	After a bit she looked at Celeste and her little lips parted in a smile.	A lady of uneasy virtue in a dissolving world._ But then she straightened her shoulders and went on.	Celeste swayed a step forward.	Perhaps I should look for it in Edmund or Ivan."	I and my god-friends like to keep some of our thoughts secret, but the other gods have forbidden us to._ A little smile flickered across the lips of the sleeping girl, and the woman in gold tights and gold-spangled jacket leaned forward thoughtfully.	"How far have they got with that?"	The Colonel said, "Ah!"	Dotty's eyes opened without making Celeste feel she had quite come awake.	Frieda asked idly.	"Don't be silly.	One of the few really startling coincidences of reality and literature."	At approximately twenty-nine miles below the surface, the delvers have encountered a metallic obstruction which they have tentatively named the durasphere.	Then he saw a figure hunched monkeylike on the last stool, almost lost in the blue shadows, while behind the bar, her crystal dress blending with the tiers of sparkling glasses, stood a grave-eyed young girl who could hardly have been fifteen.	We'll probably go into action soon.	Her footsteps were silent and he never looked back along the path whose feeble white glow rose only knee-high, lighting a low strip of shrub and mossy tree trunk to either side, no more.	His voice was clipped, rapid.	"Anyway, Dotty will be there," he said.	In each case my thoughts suit themselves to your level of comprehension.	*       *       *       *       * Rosalind didn't catch up with Theodor.	"Second, Palomar reports a large number of dark bodies approaching the Solar System at an equally incredible velocity.	"Hello," she said sleepily.	The Colonel winked at Theodor.	She told herself that this fear was an expression of her own hostility, yet she didn't really believe it.	Midway I found this half-buried in the dirt.	"Stop being eerie," Celeste said sharply.	"Well, we are a whole and, I believe, indivisible family," Theodor told her warmly.	She drew on her gloves, but she didn't hurry.	"Baby...." she implored.	Theodor said to Celeste, "Come on, dear.	"_Your guess happens to be the precise truth._" At that familiar, yet dreadly unfamiliar voice, all four of them swung toward the inner door.	But Celeste didn't want to move too fast.	"You know, Teddy," she said uncomfortably, "all this reminds me of those old myths where too much good fortune is a sure sign of coming disaster.	The Colonel laughed.	It was Colonel Fortescue, a military antique long retired from the Peace Patrol and reputed to have seen actual fighting in the Last Age of Madness.	And to whom Man is no more than a minor stage property--a trifling part of a clever job of camouflage."	Celeste started at the word.	Dotty was standing there, a sleep-stupefied little girl with a blanket caught up around her and dragging behind.	"Your planets must be burst asunder--this particular planet in the area of the Pacific--so that we may have our last chance to escape.	Without warning, an eerie tingling went through her and she was seized by a horror of the cold, grainy Earth underfoot--an ancestral terror from the days when men shivered at ghost stories about graves and tombs.	She beat at the powdery path with her hands and threw her body from side to side in agonized frenzy like some sinner frozen in the ice of the innermost circle of the ancients' hell.	Frieda stretched out on a couch and closed her eyes.	It is our last chance._        *       *       *       *       * Edmund rapped the table to gain the family's attention.	The few spaceships on Earth were reported to have blasted off, or be preparing to leave, with as many passengers as could be carried.	She wondered madly if a volume of air were falling with her through the stone.	"Why do you act so nervous around me?"	Then, after a pause, frowning, "I really am a god, you know.	Gravity would diminish abruptly to a fraction of its former value.	Their own daughter.	Celeste heard her name called.	"The rest will also be!"	Meanwhile, however, we can take courage from the words of a poem written even before Dr. Kometevsky's book:     "This Earth is not the steadfast place     We landsmen build upon;     From deep to deep she varies pace,     And while she comes is gone.	Kometevskyites have staged helicopter processions at Washington, Peking, Pretoria, and Christiana, demanding that instant preparations be made for--and I quote--'Earth's coming leap through space.'	Beneath my feet I feel     Her smooth bulk heave and dip;     With velvet plunge and soft upreel     She swings and steadies to her keel     Like a gallant, gallant ship."	There's a marked lessening of tension.	The Colonel said, "Ah-ha!"	In short, her family.	First, Lunar Observatory One says that it is visually tracking fourteen small bodies which it believes may be the lost moons of Jupiter.	Why, you'd send your scouts and destroyers fanning out toward them.	Or had they merely been playing family, experimenting with their notions of complex marriage like a bunch of silly adolescents?	They flee in great boats or ships of some sort.	"We need a break."
