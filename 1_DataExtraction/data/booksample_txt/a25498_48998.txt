Their savor only went up and rested in beads on the pane, making a veil behind which they could stiffen and grow cold in protest against an unappreciative public.	“Mother,” said Josephine, “we belong to the people who do not succeed.” “True!” replied Madame Labrosse, disconsolately.	That afternoon he dozed on the gallery and dreamed.	This one had mistaken the last month of spring for the last month of summer, and had lighted a May day with an August sun.	*        *        *        *        * Monsieur Cuerrier commenced to wear a gallant blue waistcoat all dotted with white spots, and a silk necktie with fringed ends.	I must go away—you will watch my little place when I am gone!” The postmaster was struck with pity, and he assisted her.	Adèle and Philippe kept up a conversation throughout the meal, but Charles hardly spoke.	In vain he stumped up and down his gallery, and in vain his English oaths—the roadway went through.	He held it in his emaciated fingers.	those mice and rats must have been after them again!” and would chuckle to himself to hear the children trying to keep back the laughter, out of sight around the corner.	But something had been troubling him all day, and at last, when his evening mail was closed, he put on his boots and went out.	He was seen at his best on Sunday, when, clothed in a complete suit of black, with a single carnation in his buttonhole, and with an irreproachable silk hat, he promenaded with Madame Arbique on his arm.	At last he got greater confidence; and Louis awoke from a doze one day to find him gnawing his wooden leg.	“Guess again,” he cried, “you are near it.	What hold has he upon you?	He tore it out of the bush and trampled on it.	“Of course,” he said, “I’ll have them send it to the Bardé Bank.” “Just keep cool,” said Potvin.	What if there was nothing in the box!	Let us set up a little shop.” And accordingly the front room was cleared out and transformed.	68 RUE ALFRED DE MUSSET.	Louis clutched his knife, and turned toward home.	The sunlight was streaming down on him, reflected up from the pavement and back from the house, and he basked in the heat with his eyes half shut.	Charles kept on his wonted way; if they talked in the parlor, they could hear him stirring upstairs; if they strolled in the road, they could see his light in the window.	He was a sensitive being, this, and his master’s idea had taken hold upon him.	The Arbiques considered themselves very much superior to the village people, because they had come from old France.	Maurice looked from his window into the tree on which the leaves were not yet thick enough to hide the old nests.	And they seem to talk together in sweet unsaid words until he ceases.	Something like this——” he was silent.	Opposite the window of this room there was a window in Madame Laroque’s house.	This was galling.	Adieu.” Reading this on the step, he scrawled hurriedly on a leaf of his note-book: “I would not have you thank me, but I must see you again.	He hesitated whether to ascend the gallery-steps or the ladder.	She had been accustomed to wait on the guests sometimes, when Arbique was incapacitated, and his gentle manner had won her regard.	“The name of my aunt’s second husband was Durocher.” “It will not do!” said the widow.	She let her come down to work, but watched her like a cat.	Look at me, Maurice—tell me now—” She stood with her head thrown back; and poised lightly, and with a little frown on her face.	His coat is thrown back from his shoulder.	St. Renard—St.	After the sun had set the atmosphere hung dense, falling into darkness without a movement, and when night had come the sultry air was broken by flashes of pale light, that played fitfully and without direction.	“There!” said she, thrusting it under the postmaster’s nose so that he could not get his pipe back to his mouth.	He chose the ladder.	They had attempted to fill her place by adopting a little girl, but the experiment had not been a success, and she grew to be something between a servant and a poor relation working for her board.	With his foot on the lowest rung, he said: “If I hadn’t this little scheme on hand I would go in, but—” He went up the ladder and looked in at the window.	Pierre took a step toward her.	On the hill slope stood a delicate maple that reddened the moment summer had gone, which old Etienne watched with a sigh and a shake of the head.	He swore never to be tempted again, but the morning when he took that oath, April was bleak on the hills, and a tardy spring circled in cold sunshine, leaving the buds suspended.	It is still later when he falls asleep, overcome by excitement and the stimulants which have been administered to him; and through his feverish dreams runs the sound of singing, of Josephine’s voice, inexpressibly sweet and tender, like the voice of a happy angel, but the song that she sings is—“C’est dans la vill’ de Bytown.”                               THE PEDLER.	The door opened slowly, and, taking this as an invitation to enter, he stepped into the hall.	A supercilious young man minced forward, and Josephine gave her message.	“Here comes my little fairy,” and he would go out to guide her across the one plank thrown over the ditch in front of his cabin.	His gratification was not unmixed when he saw Césarine pick it up and carry it away, blushing delicately.	HE used to come in the early spring-time, when, in sunny hollows, banks of coarse snow lie thawing, shrinking with almost inaudible tinklings, when the upper grass-banks are covered thickly with the film left by the melted snow, when the old leaves about the gray trees are wet and sodden, when the pools lie bare and clear, without grasses, very limpid with snow-water, when the swollen streams rush insolently by, when the grosbeaks try the cedar buds shyly, and a colony of little birds take a sunny tree slope, and sing songs there.	“Tell me, Philippe, what has happened?” “I cannot.” “I must know, Philippe; where have I been?” “On Wednesday night,” said he, as if the words were choking him, “you said, ‘I am the Great Napoleon!’ Then you said something about the nation, and you have not spoken since.” Charles dropped on his knees beside the table against which Philippe was leaning.	“Here they will fight—you for your abominable Prussia, I for my beautiful France.” He fell into a dramatic attitude.	This young man, of high spirit and passionate courage, found himself, at the age of twenty-five, after two years of intermittent study at a Jesuit College, fatherless, and without a sou to call his own.	Without a word she preceded him with an air of shyness, and led the way into the front room.	“Yet the furniture must be sold,” she said aloud.	I speak of what has become tradition, for the pedler walks no more up the St. Valérie road, bearing those magical baskets of his.	Listening intently, his eyes seemed to sink into his head, and burn there darkly.	It was quite late and there was not a soul on the street.	It was only for one moment; in the second, the pedler had gathered his things, blind as he was, had turned his back, and was striding up the street; in the third, one of the sudden storms had gathered the dust at the end of the village and came down with it, driving every one indoors.	“I will get it for you.	IT had been one of those days that go astray in the year, and carry the genius of their own month into the alien ground of another.	It read: “Very handsome old oak furniture.	Felice had always had her own way, and owing to Paul’s incapacity, which had overtaken him gradually, the affairs of the house had been left in her hands.	The next day no one came at all; but on the next, about four o’clock in the afternoon, a young man drove up in a dog-cart.	“No, but I am leaving everything.” “Yes, even the old furniture; if it had not been for that I would never have known you,” he said.	It was necessary to sell these heir-looms.	He took advantage of the map, and as Arbique had set pins, to which were attached red and blue pieces of wool, to show the positions of the armies, he even studied the locations and movements with interest.	“Do you regret?” whispered Pierre.	The telegram was for her.	“We must cut ourselves off; we must be the last of our race.” In those words, which in after years were often on his lips, he seemed to find some comfort, and he continued to repeat them to himself.	At last it came to be reality for him, and then he could not sit quietly and watch the lovers; he would let his pipe go out, and stride impatiently up and down the veranda.	In vain for months had the candy hearts and the red-and-white walking-sticks hung in the window.	You are the only one.” “That binds us.” “How can I thank you?” “You must not try, I have done nothing.” Just then a burning brand was hurled from the window; it fell into the lilac-tree where it devoured a cone of blossom and withered the leaves around it.	“Josephine, do not dare!” When she next found her at work she said nothing, but instead of kissing her cheek, kissed her fingers.	He mutters the words of the song which the chorus is roaring outside—“C’est dans la vill’ de Bytown.” Madame Labrosse implores him with words to come some other time.	Then, taking the empty cage, they went back to the cabin.	I think he will tell you some day.” But the “some day” seemed to recede; and all the days of May had gone and June had begun, and still Josephine did not know.	THERE was a house on the outskirts of Viger called, by courtesy, the Seigniory.	But Latulipe overheard their plan from the stairway, and as soon as she could get away without being noticed, she ran over to the watchmaker’s shop.	But why was it that trouble seemed never very far away?	“Now,” she said, “we will not see her come out again.” Mademoiselle Viau refused to take any more work.
