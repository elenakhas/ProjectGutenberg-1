A few times I had to stay around for an hour or so.	I knew her concern wasn't really for me, but it was pleasant all the same.	"As long as you leave me alone while you're doing your digging, I don't give a hang if I'm under arrest for suspicion of murder.	I was supposed to have both cash and a bank account, and I was outside a bank.	_A primary school!_ The salesman had said to me, "Everybody learns about the Dynapack in primary education."	He survived just long enough to tell me that the future has something we need.	I rubbed my pipe disgruntledly against the side of my nose to oil it.	"If there's anything I can do to help--" I told him there wasn't and left him standing there.	He turned to me puzzledly.	Naturally--everybody learns about the Dynapack in primary education.

I remembered thinking how Lou Pape would have felt if I had died of starvation with over $15,000, after borrowing from him all the time between jobs.	She ordered me to open a door on the fourth floor, and we were inside the room I'd seen from the fire escape.	Of course, being a senile psychotic, he could have considered himself broke even with that amount of money.	When I was inside, I saw a light over the window blinking red.	Any time she needed more, all she had to do was send somebody back to put down bets and buy stocks that she knew were winners.	"What others?	"You're not afraid to have us dig for her body, Mark?"	Are these things what you people have to live on?"	You're not old."	I am.	I pushed the door open and let it slam shut, hoping she'd hear it upstairs.	And a name that sounded like "El Greco."	I was just--well, you know, interested in knowing if the new models are much different or better than the old ones."	It stopped the moment I was in the room.	"Tear the place apart if you want."	Several paintings that had been lost for centuries."	The grass and trees and shrubs grew around every building, separating them from each other by wide lawns.	I obeyed, my mind anxiously chasing one possibility after another, all of them ending up with my death.	Concealed lights in the ceiling and walls began glowing, getting brighter, while the room gradually turned dark.	I didn't argue.	He went on shaking with his eyes closed and his mouth open.	"Not very appetizing.	I sat and tried to stupefy myself with brandy that should long ago have dried to brick-hardness, while Lou Pape stood at the door with his hand near his holster and glared at me.	I asked, startled.	The law couldn't convict you of them, but I can.	It could have blown up or electrocuted me, for all I knew.	Remember the Poe story that shows the best place to hide something is right out in the open, which is the last place anyone would look?	On the other hand, you know where I'm working from and could nag Sergeant Pape into getting a search warrant.	The place could have been cordoned off, with the police, the army and the navy all cooperating to nab me.

I wasn't old, but that didn't seem very comforting.	"That's a mistaken notion of how it functions.	Lost, completely lost in a totally alien world, but one in which I could still be killed or starve to death ... and God knew what was waiting for me in my own time in case I came back without the information she wanted.
