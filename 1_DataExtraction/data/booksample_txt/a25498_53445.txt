Thinks to run the talk to earth,                  Talk that carries rumor’s lease;                  Cloudy talk of vapor birth,                  Chases on the plains of peace,                  Or where tides of trade convulse;                  Something mantled like a shape                  Grasps at last with pounding pulse—                  Mist he holds; while mocking rings                  All the riot sprung anew,                  With the flap and clap of wings.	Sing me a song of the quince and the gage,               Of the apricot by the orchard wall,               Where bends my love Armitage,               Gathering the fruit of the windfall.	Pallid poplars cast a shade,                  Twinkling gray and dun,                  Where the wind and water wove                  Into one                  All the linnet leaves,                  Greening from the mere and grove                  In the undern sun.	“Avis—Avis!” cried a voice;                  Then the voice was mute.	When Spring goes by.”                                  MARCH.	A song that will bid her remember                  The north nights cool and still,                  With the thrushes fluting deep, deep,                  Deep on the pine-wood hill,                  With a star at her open window,                  When the cuckoo wakes with a start:                  Oh!	Bid him chirp and cry,                       “Everything must die,                       She is dead,”                       Now in exequy,                       All is said.	She sank and sank by yard and mast,             Sank down the shimmering gradual dark;             A little drooping pennon last             Showed like the black fin of a shark.	The very flowers are musing                  On something they longed to be,                  In a land of peace and promise,                  In a province of the sea.	When the color is free in the grasses,                 And the martins whip the mere,                 And the Maryland-yellow-throat passes,                 With his whistle quick and clear,                 The willow is full of catkins;                 May is here.	Sing me a song of the thyme and the sage,                Of sweet-marjoram in the garden gray,                Where goes my love Armitage                Pulling the summer savory.	Silent they rowed him, dip and drip,             The oars beat out an exequy,             They laid him down within the ship,             They loosed a rocket to the sky.	We plough the field,                        And harrow the clod,                        And hurl the seed.	Nothing moved along the wall,                  Weltered on the floor;                  Only in the purple deep,                  Streaming o’er,                  Came the dream of sound                  Silent as the dale of sleep,                  Where the dreams are four.	Here is pleasure; drink it down.	Here at last is something good,                    Just to warm your flagging blood.	AT LES ÉBOULEMENTS.	Then she heard within the vast                  Closure of the spell,                  Rolled and moulded into one                  Rounded swell,                  All the sounds that ever were                  Uttered underneath the sun,                  Heard in heaven or hell.	The moon is wrapped in a film,                  She looks wan and chill:                  Gather yourself in your cloak,                  The winter is over the hill.	And sometimes in the liquid night             The hull is changed, a solid gem,             That glows with a soft stony light,             The lost prince of a diadem.	She stands full-throated and with careless pose,             This woman of a weird and waning race,             The tragic savage lurking in her face,             Where all her pagan passion burns and glows;             Her blood is mingled with her ancient foes,             And thrills with war and wildness in her veins;             Her rebel lips are dabbled with the stains             Of feuds and forays and her father’s woes.	can she ever forget me                  With a song of mine in her heart?	Dear God!	How they wreathe and run,                    Silvern as a filmy light,                    Filtered from the sun:                    The god of sound is out of sight,                    And the bell is like a cloud,                    Humming to the outer rim,                    Low and loud:                    (Bim—bim—bim.)	Hunger and poverty                    Heaped like the ocean                    Welters and mutters,                    _Hold back the sickles!_                    Millions of children                    Born to their terrible                    Ancestral hunger,                    Starved in their mothers’ womb,                    Starved at the nipple, cry,—                    _Ours is the harvest!_                    Millions of women                    Learned in the tragical                    Secrets of poverty,                    Sweated and beaten, cry,—                    _Hold back the sickles!_                    Millions of men                    With a vestige of manhood,                    Wild-eyed and gaunt-throated,                    Shout with a leonine                    Accent of anger,                    _Leave us the wheat-fields!_                    When will the reapers                    Strike in their sickles?	A SONG.	Sing me a song of the spangled dells,              Where hepaticas tremble in starry groups,              Of the adder-tongue swinging its golden bells              As the light wind swoops.	October 3rd, 1893.	DIRGE FOR A VIOLET.	But she neither moved nor heard,                  Trancèd was her breath;                  Lip on charmèd lip was laid                  (One who saith                  “Love—Undone” and falls).	Then the prophet robin                  Hidden in the crab-tree                  Railed upon the farmer,                  “I told you so, I told you so.”                  As the rain grew stronger,                  And his heart grew prouder,                  Notes so full and slow                  Coming blither, louder,                  “I told you so, I told you so,”                  “I told you so.”                            THE DAME REGNANT.	“Avis!” soft the echo lay                  As the lute.	Her life was touched with early frost,                 About the April of her day,                 Her hold on earth was lightly lost,                 And like a leaf she went away.	Where quick speech is dammed we find                  Cactus deserts sharp and dim,                  Dead for water, ruin lined,                  With a mirage on the rim                  Of the sundown.	shifty Dame,                  Rumor’s last must be the same!	A SONG.	The birds cry out and are silent,                  They are dreaming once again                  Of the tawny-throated hollow,                  And the fern in the glen.	The reader will grow weary of the play,           Finding his heart half understood,           And with the young moon in the early dusk will stray           Beside the starry water in the wood.	And then she claims her sleep,             As if she knows my love and trusts it deep.	A SONG.	The world is spinning for change,                  And life has rapid wings;                  Oh, one needs a steady heart                  Not to falter while he sings.	Now the wind is gusty                        In the maple tops,                        Striking out the lusty                        Storms of gleaming drops.	The fruit that is checked and marred                 Goes under the sod:                 The good lives here in the world;                 It persists,—it is God.	Then shaking out her lawny sails,             Forth on the misty sea she crept;             She left the dawning of the dales,             Yet in his cloak the piper slept.	Whoo—whoo—                     The steam from the thatches,                     The casement tawny in patches;                     Look not yet,                     You might never forget                     The ghost of breath,                     Or the leper Death,                       Whoo—whoo;—yu-loô—yu-loô.	ON THE MOUNTAIN.	II.	IN MAY.	And often in the morning of the heart,            When memories are like crocus-buds in spring,            Thou hast up-builded in thy crystal soul            Immutable forms of things loved once and lost,            Or loved and never gained.	to whom the bravest of us is a child,             When I am weary, when I cannot rest,             I have stretched out my hand into the dark,             And felt the shadow stark,             But no face brooding near,             Nor any tear             Compassionately wept:             I have not slept.	what rapture the glad robin wakes—       “When Spring goes by; Spring!	Her soul was chartered for great deeds,                 For gentle war unwonted here:                 Her spirit sought her clearer needs,                 An Empyrean atmosphere.	Ah!	Like the kernels in quern,                        Each in turn,                        Comes to his hour,                        Nor fast nor slow:                        It is well: even so.	[1]         Vengeance was once her nation’s lore and law:         When the tired sentry stooped above the rill,         Her long knife flashed, and hissed, and drank its fill;         Dimly below her dripping wrist she saw,         One wild hand, pale as death and weak as straw,         Clutch at the ripple in the pool; while shrill         Sprang through the dreaming hamlet on the hill,         The war-cry of the triumphant Iroquois.	Mark your Dame of many crowns,                  How she hardens into sphinx,                  When she hears the airy ring                  Of the master that she owns,                  How, amorphous bulk, she shrinks,                  How she trails and leers and winks,                  Just a moment of gray rags,                  Ere the wind has pounced and packed                  All her baggage and her bags                  Into limbo, and the dust                  Rises in a smoke, and wracked                  Drives the cloud in shreds and shags.	From hazy hamlets, one by one,                    Beyond the island bars,                    The casements in the setting sun                    Flash back in violet stars.	the soft budding of the virginal woods,       Of the frail fruit trees by the vanishing lakes:       There’s the new moon where the clear sunset floods,       A trace of dew upon the rose leaf sky;       And hark!	It trails into a silver blur,                And hangs about the cherry tops                That sprinkle, with the wind astir,                In little sudden whirls of drops.	TO B. W. B.	Speech is but the fluid mind,                  Reaching outward over life.	They saw the salt plain spark and shine,             They threw their faces to the sky;             Beneath a deepening film of brine             They saw the star-flash blur and die.	When the great day is done,             That seems so long,             So full of fret and fun,             Our little girl is in her cradle laid:             She takes the soft dark-petaled flower of sleep             Between her fragile hands,             Striving to pluck it:             And as the dream-roots slowly part,             She is not in possession of the lands,             Where flowered her tender heart,             Nor in this turmoil dire of cark and strife,             Which we call life,             The which, husbanding all our art,             We will keep veiled until the latest day,             And from her wrapt away:             Then when the drowsy flower             Has parted from the dreamful mead,             And in her palm lies plucked indeed,             When her dear breathing steadies after sighs,             And the soft lids have clouded the blue eyes,             A tiny hand falls on my cheek—             Lightly and so fragrantly             As if a snow-flake could a rose-leaf be—             And in the dark touches a tear             Which has sprung clear,             From eyes unconscious of their own distress,             At the deep pathos of such tender helplessness.	It broke in many a crimson sphere             That grew to gold and floated far,             And left the sudden shore-line clear,             With one slow-changing, drifting star.	THE HAPPY FATALIST.	Sing me a song of the fallen mast,                Of the sharp odor the pomace sheds,                Of the purple beets left last                In the garden beds.	EQUATION.	And down so slowly, down and down,             Rivet by rivet, plank by plank;             A little flood of ocean flown             Across the deck, she sank and sank.	And now to the wheat-fields                    Come the weird reapers                    Armed with their sickles,                    Whipping them keenly                    In the fresh-air fields,                    Wild with the joy of them,                    Finding them trusty,                    Hilted with teen.

He springs upon the trees,                  And he shakes the sleeping nest;                  And every little water-pool                  Has a troubled breast.	Sing me a song of the toiling bees,                Of the long flight and the honey won,                Of the white hives under the apple-trees,                In the hazy sun.	I cherish and cherish my timid guest,            For oh, he has grown so dear to me            That my heart would break if he left his nest,            And dwelt in the strange land down by the sea.	this comedy began                  When the earth was blithe and young,                  When the less fair of the fair                  Daughters of the world of men,                  Whispered in their errant hair,                  How their sisters of the glance,                  Clear and deep of star in blue,                  Met the eager sons of God,                  In the valley, in the dew,                  On the myrtle-scented sod:                  And the truants from the spheres                  Heard like donging of herd-bells,                  In the flow of harp and flute,                  How those others in eclipse,                  Withered up in jealousies,                  Crowning malice in the eyes,                  Over malice on the lips,                  Hissed their word of hate and lies.	The wind is wild to-night,                  In the dark he turns and stirs,                  Or he falls into dream and quiet,                  In the gloomy heart of the firs.	WATKWENIES.	A brig is straining out for sea,                    To Norway or to France she goes,                    And all her happy flags are free,                    Her sails are flushed with rose.	And the comments run from “Pish,”                  To the most convenient curse,                  In the beggar’s damning purse.	Then she heard her mother’s voice,                  Tender as a dove;                  Then her lover plain and sigh,                  “Avis—Love!”                  Like the mavis bird                  Calling, calling lonelily                  From the eerie grove.	Ask not the question!—                    Something tremendous                    Moves to the answer.	When will the reapers                    Strike in their sickles,                    Bending and grasping,                    Shearing and spreading;                    When will the gleaners                    Searching the stubble                    Take the last wheat-heads                    Home in their arms?	Sing me a song of the shallow lakes,              Of the hollow fall of the nimble rill,              Of the trolling rapture the robin wakes              On the windy hill.	The rain is awake on the mountain,              ’T is lashing the forest afar              With fall of a shattering fountain              And the tramp and tumult of war,              With the drums of the detoning thunder,              And the clang in the bugles of wind,              With the gonfalons tortured asunder              By the rush of the host from behind.
