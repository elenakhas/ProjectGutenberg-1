Tom grinned tiredly, his eyes far away.	The life of David Ingersoll.	Shandor stared.	Ingersoll was one man the people could trust.	"I don't get it," he said dully.	Shandor stared at her.	Suddenly he galvanized into action.	Shandor stumbled to a chair, sat down woodenly.	We've been puppets on strings, and one man engineered it, from the very start.	Shandor's face was deathly white.	"But if that conference fails, _we're in full-scale war_!"	Motors and materials, all for Arizona--something caught his mind, brought a frown to his large bland face, some off-key note in the monstrous symphony of production and intrigue that threw up a red flag in his mind, screamed for attention-- And then he sipped the fresh coffee at his elbow and sighed, and looked up at the girl standing there, saw her hand tremble as she steadied herself against the desk, and sat down beside him.	Shandor's voice cut sharply through the room.	It won't do you any good to be here if the Earth is blasted to bits.	Shandor frowned, a snag in the chain drawing his attention.	_That's_ the truth--why not tell that to the people?"	"Munitions people, mostly.	"Name anybody in the current administration.	"I never meant anything more in my life."	"I didn't think there was anybody left like that," she said.	I also know that most of your writing, while you were doing Public Information Board work, was never ordered by PIB.	Where are they?"	Shandor growled angrily, surveying the pile of notes with a sinking feeling of incredulity.	Mile upon mile of jagged, rocky crags, black rock, ageless, unaged rock.	I need some help, badly."	"I'm sorry.	Shandor flushed angrily.	How about it, Mariel?	he whispered.	Educated at Rutgers University and MIT.	Washington DC was badly hit, as were New York and Philadelphia, and further raids are expected to originate from Siberia, coming across the great circle to the West coast or the Middle west.	A second blow from the side caught him solidly in the blackness, grunting, flailing out into a tangle of legs and arms, cursing, catching a foot in his face, striking up into soft, yielding flesh-- And his head suddenly exploded into a million dazzling lights as he sank unconscious to the ground--        *       *       *       *       * It was a tiny room, completely without windows, the artificial light filtering through from ventilation slits near the top.	Lincoln Airbase was in a flurry of activity; the field was alive with men, like little black ants, preparing the reserve fighters and pursuits for use in a fever of urgent speed.	A simple, innocuous listing, which froze him to his seat.	Shandor read off his list, giving dates.	I'll go over it closely when I get out of here.	A little dose is so painful you can't do anything but holler for a while, but it won't hurt you permanently unless you get it all over you.	So ideologies arose to try to solve the dilemma of a basically static society, and they fought wars.	I might say I'm a very expert propagandist.	His calculations placed him over Eastern Nebraska, and a few moments later he nosed down cautiously and verified his location.	I know I'm right, but I have to go, to check something--to make sure of something."	They've got a smaller one in Nevada."	The little man twisted his hands, almost in tears.	But I can't remember anything specific, except that he used to say over and over how he hated the thought of another war.	Baker grinned and chomped his tobacco.	He flipped off the connection before Prex could reply.	The girl shrugged.	David P. Ingersoll.	And there isn't any air.	"You've pointed out the whole trouble.	"Is it serious?"	I don't think he wanted me because of the writing.	"You set me up for a sucker, but the plan fell through.	Mariel's eyes were sullen.	He got in people's way, and they hated him for it.	He always--" "No, no--that's not right.	I need somebody along who knows how to make things painful."	He took up a dozen of the stories, analyzed them carefully, word for word, sentence by sentence.	Some of the dispatches were Associated Press; many came direct desk from Public Information Board in New York; two other networks sponsored some of the wordage.	"I've only met him a couple of times.	Because a crazy, twisted, impossible idea was in his mind, an idea that had plagued him since he had started reading that morning, an idea with an answer, an acid test, folded in the briefcase under his arm.	Shandor's eyes narrowed.	He shrugged his huge shoulders and settled affably down on a bench near the wall.	You're the only one I know that could do the job."	"A propagandist has to write it, Tommy--an ace propagandist.	He read it, unbelievingly, yet knowing that it was the only possible link.	Don't know who it was, but he sounded mighty agitated."	A small grate in the panel before him popped open, and a small spool plopped out onto a spindle.	Then he sat back, his body tired, eyes closed in concentration, an incredible idea twisting and writhing and solidifying in his mind.	"You say it's all right, it's all right.	"Long enough."	Things happened so fast, and I was so confused--" She looked straight at him.	You're crazy!"	"But you'll have to read it in the newspapers."	Shandor blinked.	I'll fight what he stands for now he's dead--" Shandor's eyes narrowed.	Police are following all possible leads, and are confident that there has been no foul play.	Prex shrugged.	Oh, Tom, I was afraid-- Oh, _Tom_!"	How big could Dartmouth Bearing be?	"Ann, I've got to go ahead.	Told his daughter to send it to Public Information Board immediately in event of his death.	"All the administration offices are in Chicago.
