For the soul of man is a guest that has gone hungry these centuries back, and never has it to be summoned twice to the nuptial feast.	Did we but dread beauty less it would come about that nought else in life would be visible; for in reality it is beauty that underlies everything, it is beauty alone that exists.	I felt that I had arrived, alone, at that sad zone of kisses when it seems to us that we are visiting the hovels of the poor, while she, who had lingered on the road, was still smiling in the palace of the first days.	It is as though men dreaded the contact of their soul, and were anxious to keep its beauty at immeasurable distance.	One might almost believe that there exists, somewhere, a place where all is weighed in the presence of the spirits, or perhaps, out yonder, the other side of the night, a reservoir of certitudes whither the silent herd of souls flock every morning to slake their thirst.	It means that each day will reveal to us a new beauty in that mysterious angel, and that we shall walk together in a goodness that shall ever become more and more living, loftier and loftier.	It cannot forgive, for forgiveness here were but the denial of itself.	Do you not think it would be more akin to the discourse that would naturally be held between two souls?	Loving thus, we can no longer have anything to conceal, for that the ever-present soul transforms all things into beauty.	Why not dare to be the one to "begin."	Thus, he continued, I have caused suffering because I loved, and also have I caused suffering because I did not love--but how great was the difference in the two cases!	Needs must one god beckon to another, and no signal is so imperceptible but they will every one of them respond.	Can the beauty not exist that is not understood, and is there not in every man something that does understand--in regions far beyond what he seems to understand, far beyond, too, what he believes he understands?	It means that the least gesture will call forth the presence of the soul with all its treasure.	Does not evil itself become precious so soon as it has gathered therefrom the deep lying diamond of repentance?	I said just now that the soul changed into beauty the little things we gave to it.	But it matters not; we have learned that nothing can be lost in the soul, and that even to the very pettiest there come moments of splendor.	This is brought home to us at every moment of our life, and is no less evident to the man by whom beauty may more than once have been denied than to him who is ever seeking it in his heart.	Would you go to him whose shake of the head had sullied a generous action or a mere impulse that was pure?	It requires more effort to fall, perhaps, than to rise.	And yet will you have rendered no assistance to the untiring queen; other thoughts will have filled your mind, and it will be without your knowledge that the act will have been purified in the silence of your being, and will have flown into the precious waters that lie in the great reservoir of truth and beauty, which, unlike the shallower reservoir of true or beautiful thoughts, has an ever unruffled surface, and remains for all time out of reach of the breath of life.	They will see it and their greeting to you will be very different than had you been meditating how best to deceive your brother.	Its nature changes from the moment that it manifests itself by means of an exterior act; and we are no longer in the truth according to the soul, but in a kind of falsehood as conceived by man.	Nothing responds more infallibly to the secret cry of goodness than the secret cry of goodness that is near.	Grief is love's first food, and every love that has not been fed on a little pure suffering must die like the babe that one had tried to nourish on the nourishment of a man.	And if our eyes bring it nothing, still will it know how to turn its pitiful disillusion into something ineffable, that it will conceal even till its death.	They themselves had been the first to be beautiful, and had therefore attracted all the beauty that passed by, as a lighthouse attracts the vessels from the four corners of the horizon.	Is it all that is admirable and sorrowful in the mere act of living that, at such moments, floods our being--is it the aspect of life, one and indivisible?	And yet does it not reveal itself to the eyes of the body.	Loving thus, we have no longer even the need to forgive.	Even he who rejects your word will, in spite of himself, have taken a step towards the beauty that is within him.	But one day, peradventure, the word comes up again extraordinarily transformed, and revealing the unexpected fruit it has borne in the darkness; then silence once more falls over all.	If we could but probe to the root of things it might well be discovered that it is by the strength of some souls that are beautiful that others are sustained in life.	If you have never in your life felt the power of your invisible goodness, go no further; it would be useless.	These men had "begun."	Do you imagine it would pass quite unnoticed or merely arouse surprise?	Bear it in mind, however, that here we are on the mountains, where not to know oneself means far more than mere ignorance of what takes place within us at moments of jealousy or love, fear or envy, happiness or unhappiness.	It cannot be said too often that, be the crevice never so small, it will yet suffice for all the waters of heaven to pour into our soul.	Loving thus, we perceive truth in happiness as profoundly as some of the heroes perceived it in the radiance of greatest sorrow.	We know now that another love had sprung to life, a love that demands not the words, the little attentions and smiles of ordinary love.	I have for a long time followed that man's life, and have seen the inexplicable power he exercised over the most obscure, the most unapproachable, the blindest, even the most rebellious of souls.	And would it not be in accordance with the primal truth if all men were to feel that they were face to face with each other, even as the woman feels with the man she loves?	Resignedly does it labor, its whole life long, in the darkness whither most of us relegate it, where it is spoken to by none.	But if the door open not (and how many lives are there wherein it does open?)	But in this idea how much is there of the soul that is chosen, how much of him who chooses?	It is there in its simplicity, smiling on the threshold of our soul; and those in whom its smiles lies deepest, or shine forth most frequently, may make us suffer day and night and they will, yet shall it be beyond our power to cease to love them....	There are within us lives in which we love unconsciously.	e._ divine--concludes thus: "As regards ourselves, we are beautiful when we belong to ourselves, and ugly when we lower ourselves to our inferior nature.	And yet with the generality of men, ingenuity, strength and skill do but imply that the soul must first of all be banished from their life, and that every impulse that lies too deep must be carefully brushed aside.	"Even to the very wretchedest of all," said to me one day the loftiest minded creature it has ever been my happiness to know, "even to the very wretchedest of all I never have the courage to say anything in reply that is ugly or mediocre."	We are surprised when certain men tell us that they have never come across real ugliness, that they cannot conceive that a soul can be base.	But are there really any who have not felt this power, and have the worst of us never been invisibly good?	Wherefore you will do well to think it over, for none are alone, and those who are good must watch.	"Much is to learn, much to forget,        Through worlds I shall traverse not a few."	It is no law of our making, and I know not whether I would dare to love the man who had made no one weep.	At moments we might believe it to be a recollection, furtive, but excessively keen, of the great primitive unity.	Some there are who do thus in beauty love each other.	There is no soul but is conscious of this, none that is not in readiness; but where are those that hide not their beauty?	The souls of all our brethren are ever hovering about us, craving for a caress, and only waiting for the signal.	Even though perhaps you had been of those who commended him, you would none the less, when it was truth that knocked at your door, turn to the man who had known how to prostrate himself and love.	There, never complaining, does it do all that in its power lies, striving to tear from out the pebbles we fling to it the nucleus of eternal light that peradventure they contain.	We see nothing but bucklers and helmets, we touch nothing but iron and brass.	Hide as it may, let it but raise its head, move a link of its chain or open its hand, and the prison is illumined, the pressure of radiance from within bursts open the iron barrier, and then, suddenly, there yawns a gulf between words and beings, a gulf peopled with agitated angels; silence falls over all: the eyes turn away for a moment and two souls embrace tearfully on the threshold....	"For my part," said a sage to me one day, "I have never come across a single woman who did not bring to me something that was great."	But there are those who complain of women, for instance, never dreaming that, the first time a man meets a woman, a single word or thought that denies the beautiful or profound will be enough to poison for ever his existence in her soul.	While you are actively good in the invisible, all those who approach you will unconsciously do things that they could not do by the side of any other man.	As we wander from the gods within us so does ugliness enwrap us; as we discover them, so do we become more beautiful.	No longer is there need of death, disaster or tears for that the soul shall appear; a smile suffices.	Whereas, on the contrary, we should endeavor to move in advance of ourselves.	And yet in the domain where we are everything is effective, for that everything is waiting.	To love thus means more than to have pity, to make inner sacrifices, to be anxious to help and give happiness; it is a thing that lies a thousand fathoms deeper, where our softest, swiftest, strongest words cannot reach it.	Ah!	This was brought home to me that evening.	We are afraid of everything that cannot be explained by word or gesture; and we shut our eyes to all that we do, ourselves notwithstanding, in the empire where explanations are vain!	And yet what is needed to become the grown-up person for whom they lie in wait?	It is unmistakably borne home to us that even the unhappiest and the most destitute of men have at the depths of their being and in spite of themselves a treasure of beauty that they cannot despoil.	Why are we so fearful lest we exhaust the heaven within us?	And to love thus means that, little by little, the sense of ugliness is lost; that one's eyes are closed to all the littlenesses of life, to all but the freshness and virginity of the very humblest of souls.	Then why keep back a lofty, beautiful word, for that you doubt whether others will understand?	Might not everything naturally turn into beauty, were we not unceasingly interrupting the arduous labors of our soul?	When we raise our eyes it yearns for a ray of sun or star, that it may weave into a thought, or, haply, an impulse, which shall be unconscious and very pure.	The soul is not exacting.	And yet it is possible that nothing is changing in the life one sees; but is it only that which matters, and is our existence indeed confined to actions we can take in our hand like stones on the highroad?
