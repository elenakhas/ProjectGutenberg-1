You are ill.	[With surprise.]	Will you, Erhart?	ELLA RENTHEIM.	[Looking away from her.]	She wants to stand in your mother's place to you, Erhart!	She bows formally to BORKMAN, who returns         her bow in silence.	ELLA RENTHEIM.	MRS. BORKMAN.	It may be that a mother's sorrows and tears were what I needed most.	It was all he possessed.	Very well, Ella; the house is yours---- ELLA RENTHEIM.	[Repelling the idea.]	Is this meant for me?	For if you hadn't that to cling to, you feel that you would utterly despair.	It's just round the corner.	She tells me that they start early to-morrow morning; quite early.	Really?	MRS. BORKMAN.	It was a covered sledge, and the curtains were down.	No doubt--after all the money you have spent upon him.	Go on!	ELLA RENTHEIM.	Oh, you must not believe that, Ella.	I see it in your face.	Perhaps after all----!	FOLDAL.	What do you want with me again?	Has he really been so close to your heart?	He has not come yet; but I expect him every moment.	Do not do it, Erhart!	MRS. BORKMAN.	As I was saying, I know all the sacrifices you have made for me and for your sister.	Well, then, say it right out.	You might perfectly well have been happy with him.	[Staring at her.]	Not when I am fighting to preserve a mother's power over my son!	That is plain enough in the letters he writes me from time to time.	You took charge of Erhart, and cared for him in every way---- ELLA RENTHEIM.	Oh, help him, Erhart!	Without his support I could not have done anything.	Can you tell me of a single one that is good for anything?	ERHART.	But isn't that just the essence of friendship, John Gabriel?	[BORKMAN, lost in thought, goes up to the piano, and is about         to close it, but changes his mind.	FOLDAL.	For happiness, mother!	BORKMAN.	No, no, I won't let you out!	You?	[Raising her head proudly.]	ELLA RENTHEIM.	[Nods.]	We are only wasting each other's time.	I can quite understand that it must appear impossible to you, Mrs. Borkman.	I knew nothing of this.	I could see you--the whole of you--in his letters of late.	[Firmly and emphatically.]	Who?	And live your life-- and be as happy--as happy as ever you can.	I have never known pity, since you deserted me.	Oh, indeed!	ERHART stands for a          moment as though wavering; then he turns and follows her.	ELLA RENTHEIM.	What one?	Indeed?	Oh, I beg your pardon--you have a visitor.	That you shall never have in this world!	[Inquiringly.]	MRS. BORKMAN.	ERHART.	BORKMAN.	The power to create human happiness in wide, wide circles around me!	It wouldn't greatly matter, I should say.	She has made quite a study of Erhart; looked deep into his character--into his soul.	[Wringing her hands.]	But don't you hear, he has been run over!	BORKMAN.	ELLA RENTHEIM.	ERHART.	BORKMAN.	MRS. WILTON.	BORKMAN.
