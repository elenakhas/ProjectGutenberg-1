*       *       *       *       *     They know no light, nor any star,     Those ruined plains of Tantramar.	There they died to a man, but not till they had slain so many of the savages that the invading force was shattered and compelled to withdraw.]	High through the drenched and hollow night their wings       Beat northward hard on winter’s trail.	_THE FORTRESS_     While raves the midnight storm,     And roars the rain upon the windy roof,     Heart held to heart and all the world aloof,     We laugh secure and warm.	The time is the time of vision;       The hour is the hour of calm;     Hark!	From the high gray tower       The great bell sobs in its brazen throat.	Naked of flock and fold the fallows lie,     Thin streaked with meagre drift.	_THE FLIGHT OF THE GEESE_     I hear the low wind wash the softening snow,       The low tide loiter down the shore.	Only in this high pasture is there dearth,       Where the gray thistles crowd in ranks austere,       As if the sod, close-cropt for many a year,     Brought only bane and bitterness to birth.	Is it no more than lover’s pain         That makes thy heart so wild?	But at the marsh’s inmost edge,     Where a tall fringe of flag and sedge     Catches a climbing hawthorn hedge,         A lonely hulk is seen.	Through the hush benign     One white-throat voices, till the stars appear,       The benediction of the Thought Divine.	The dyke!	Then I hitched the mare in the pung an’ soon was bowlin’ along     Down by the crick to Nance’s while the moon was white an’ high.	St. Lawrence, whose wide water laves     The shores that ne’er have nourished slaves!	What profit now to know if just the doom,       Though harsh!	I     Grows the great deed, though none     Shout to behold it done!	Now beat the yelling butchers down.	The wine-warm dusks, that brim the valley, gleam       With here and there a lonely casement.	So many visions, so entranced a slumber,       Such dreams possess the noonday’s luminous sphere,       That earth, content with knowing Heaven so near,     Hath done with aspiration and desire.	The squaws steered themselves and their captors over the Falls.]	II     Comes night to the quiet hills     Where the Madawaska spills,--     To his slumbering huts no warning,     Nor mirth of another morning!	All this you knew and loved with me;       All this in our delight had part;     And now--though us earth sees no more       As comrades, heart to heart--     This kindly strength of open fields,       This faith of eve, this calm of air,     They lift my spirit close to you       In memory and prayer.	---- One moment in that surging hell     The old wharf shook, then cringed and fell.	Across the tide a sail       That tosses, and is gone--     And in my heart the kiss       That longing dreams upon.	We started off with racing-teams and moonlight on the snow;         _Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_     And soon again the winter world was voiceless as of old,     Alone with all the wheeling stars, and the great white cold.	Down the dusk hillside       Lumbers the wain; and day fades out like smoke.	She does not heed the storm.	O’er the loud world sweep       The scourge and the rod;     But in deep beyond deep       Is the stillness of God;--     At the Fountains of Life     No cry, no strife.	Sombre, impenetrable, round its rim       The fir-trees bend and brood.	The great flood lifts.	Into the happy harbour hastening, gay       With press of snowy canvas, tall ships throng.	III     Where the shoaling waters froth,     Churned thick like devils’ broth,--     Where the rocky shark-jaw waits,     Never a bark that grates.	Come, boys, and bring a load!’     ’Twas a new idee in them parts, an’ Bill Simmons made ’n oration     About ‘High Church innovation,’ an’ ‘a-driftin’ back to Rome,’     But I backed the parson’s rights to have Church o’ moonlight nights;     An’ I thought of Nance’s cute red lips, an’ pinted straight fur home.	The harvest light is on the hills anew,     And cheer in the grave acres’ fruitful girth.	This is that ancient cape of tears and storm,       Whose towering front inviolable frowns     O’er vales Evangeline and love keep warm--       Whose fame thy song, O tender singer, crowns.	Set hand to hand, lay brand to brand,       But we shall not return.	It was easier goin’ now, an’ Nance woke up all rosy.	The thick dark hems me, even to the restless brain.	And all noon long the sun, with chemic ray,       Seals up each cordial essence in its cell,     That in the dusky stalls, some winter’s day,       The spirit of June, here prisoned by his spell,       May cheer the herds with pasture memories.	The crying knives glide on; the green swath lies.	They stopped the breach; they healed the scar.	_MIDWINTER THAW_     How shrink the snows upon this upland field,       Under the dove-grey dome of brooding noon!	The plains lie dim below.	_MARSYAS_     A little grey hill-glade, close-turfed, withdrawn     Beyond resort or heed of trafficking feet,     Ringed round with slim trunks of the mountain ash.	They go where follow our smiles and tears,       The gold of youth and the gray of age,     Where falls the storm and falls the stillness,       The laughter of spring and winter’s rage.	Faints in the sudden blare     The cry of their swift despair,     And the captives’ death-chant shrills ...	_Oh, merry swing the axes, and the bright chips fly!_     The dishes on the dresser-shelves were shining blue and white,     And o’er the loaded table the lamps beamed bright.	To-night athwart an inky sky     A narrowing sun dropped angrily,     Scoring the gloom with dreadful dye,         A bitter and flaming scar.	Black on the ridge, against that lonely flush,       A cart, and stoop-necked oxen; ranged beside       Some barrels; and the day-worn harvest-folk,     Here emptying their baskets, jar the hush       With hollow thunders.	These common fields appear     The consecrated home of hopes past number.	And we washed them down with tides of tea and oceans of spruce beer.	_THE MOWING_     This is the voice of high midsummer’s heat.	_Oh, merry swing the axes, and the bright chips fly!_     The hard wood and the soft wood, we felled them for our use;     And chiefly, for its scented gum, we loved the scaly spruce;         _Oh, the frost is on the forest, and the snow piles high!_     And here and there, with solemn roar, some hoary tree came down,     And we heard the rolling of the years in the thunder of its crown.	And when our last has fallen in blood       Between these waters black,     Their tribe shall no more lust for war,--       For we shall not turn back.	She didn’t keep me waitin’, fur church was at half-pas’ seven;     An’ my idee of Heaven, as I tucked her into the furs,     Was a-ridin’ with Nance at night when the moon was high an’ white,     An’ the deep sky all a-sparkle like them laughin’ eyes of hers.	O zithern-winged musician, whence it came,       I wonder, this insistent song of thine!	And at her spinning-wheel within     The mother’s hands forget to spin.	The spell of night and wind,       Baffling desire and dream, dost thou too find?	’Twas a tallish tramp, I tell you, a-leadin’ that flounderin’ mare     Thro’ snow drifts anywheres from four to six foot deep.	It seems the spirit of a flower,     This offspring of the Autumn hour,     Wandering back to earth to bring     Some kindly afterthought of Spring.	The snow hung down the woodpiles all scalloped-like an’ curled.	I see thy cool green plains afar.	_THE OAT-THRESHING_     A little brown old homestead, bowered in trees       That o’er the Autumn landscape shine afar,       Burning with amber and with cinnabar.	Annapolis, do thy floods yet feel     Faint memories of Champlain’s keel,       Thy pulses yet the deed repeat     Of Poutrincourt and d’Iberville?	But ’twas grand to hear Nance sing ‘Glory to the new-born King,’     Tho’ the way the choir folks stared at us, it made me kind of narvous.	The night       Full filled with April forecast, hath no light.	IV     The clear stream glimmers before them;     The faint night falters o’er them;     Lashed lightly bark to bark,     They glide the windless dark.	_Oh, merry swing the axes, and the bright chips fly!_     So still the air and chill the air the branches seemed asleep,     But we broke their ancient visions as the axe bit deep.	And, to pilot the noiseless foe     Through the perilous passes, go     Two women who could not die--     Whom the knife in the dark passed by.	When comes the hour to break this ’prisoning shard,       And reunite with Him that breathed me forth,     Then shall this atom of the Eternal Soul     Encompass thee in its benign control!	Amid its gold-green coverts meet     The late dew and the noonday heat;     Around it, to the sea-rim harsh,     The patient levels of the marsh;     And o’er it the pale heavens bent,     Half sufferance and half content.	_THE SUCCOUR OF GLUSKÂP_ (A MICMAC LEGEND)     The happy valley laughed with sun,       The corn grew firm in stalk,     The lodges clustered safe where run       The streams of Peniawk.	In vain       These aching lips, these hungering hearts that strain     Toward the denied fruition of our bliss,       Had love not learned of longing to devise       Out of desire and dream our paradise.	An’ I could feel her shoulder, kind of comfortin’ an’ warm,     Nestlin’ agin my arm,--sech a sweet an’ cunnin’ shoulder.	The brute sea shakes     The sheltering wall.	_THE VALLEY OF THE WINDING WATER_     The valley of the winding water       Wears the same light it wore of old,     Still o’er the purple peaks the portals       Of distance and desire unfold.	A holy music, heard in vain     By coward heart and sordid brain,       To whom this strenuous being seems     Naught but a greedy race for gain.	My eyes are on the greening earth,       The exultant bobolinks wild awing;     And yet, of all this kindly gladness,       My heart beholds not anything.	Long rest we soon shall earn.	_TIDES_     Through the still dusk how sighs the ebb-tide out       Reluctant for the reed-beds!	And when the windless noon grew hot,       And the white sun beat like steel,     In shade about the shimmering pot       They gathered to their meal.	It lies forgotten of all tides,     The grass grows round its bleaching sides,     An endless inland peace abides         About its mouldering age.
