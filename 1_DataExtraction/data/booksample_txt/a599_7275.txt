There is evident, and more strongly in certain later poems, a tendency toward quantitative measure.	Compare, for instance, a passage from "Provincia Deserta":   I have walked                into Perigord   I have seen the torch-flames, high-leaping,   Painting the front of that church,--   And, under the dark, whirling laughter,   I have looked back over the stream                and seen the high building,   Seen the long minarets, the white shafts.	Some of the poems (including several of the "Contemporanea") are a more direct statement of views than Pound's verse had ever given before.	He has said himself that when one has the proper material for a sonnet, one should use the sonnet form; but that it happens very rarely to any poet to find himself in possession of just the block of stuff which can perfectly be modelled into the sonnet.

OTHER PUBLICATIONS "DES IMAGISTES," poems by several authors selected by Ezra   Pound, published as a number of "The Glebe," in New York.	It is, in fact, just this adaptability of metre to mood, an adaptability due to an intensive study of metre, that constitutes an important element in Pound's technique.	The only kind of emotion     worthy of a poet is the inspirational emotion which     energises and strengthens, and which is very remote from the     everyday emotion of sloppiness and sentiment.... And as for the platform of Imagism, here are a few of Pound's "Don'ts for Imagists":     Pay no attention to the criticisms of men who have never     themselves written a notable work.

There are not, as a matter of fact, two kinds of verse, the strict and the free; there is only a mastery which comes of being so well trained that form is an instinct and can be adapted to the particular purpose in hand.

"GAUDIER-BRZESKA," an article in "The New Age," February 4,   1915.	Mr. Richard Aldington (whose own accomplishments as a writer of vers libre qualify him to speak) called the poem "unsurpassed and unsurpassable," and a writer in the _New Age_ (a literary organ which has always been strongly opposed to metrical innovations) called it "one of the finest literary works of art produced in England during the last ten years."	There are influences, but deviously.	There are, here and there, deliberate archaisms or oddities (e.g., "herward"); there are deliberately arbitrary images, having their place in the total effect of the poem:   Red leaf that art blown upward and out and over   The green sheaf of the world ...

The virile complaint,     the revolt of the poet, all which shows his emotion,--that     is poetry.	His "Canzoni" are in a way aside from his direct line of progress; they are much more nearly studies in mediaeval appreciation than any of his other verse; but they are interesting, apart from their merit, as showing the poet at work with the most intricate Provencal forms--so intricate that the pattern cannot be exhibited without quoting an entire poem.	The   first arrangements for the anthology were made through the   kind offices of John Cournos during the winter of 1912-13.	The Noh are not so important as the Chinese poems (certainly not so important for English); the attitude is less unusual to us; the work is not so solid, so firm.	After work in Spain and Italy, after pursuing the Provençal verb from Milan to Freiburg, he deserted the thesis on Lope de Vega and the Ph.D. and the professorial chair, and elected to remain in Europe.	Though I've roamed through many places,   None there is that my heart troweth   Fair as that wherein fair groweth   One whose laud here interlaces   Tuneful words, that I've essayed.	He     has succeeded, where all others have failed, in evolving a     blend of the imagery of the unfettered West, the vocabulary     of Wardour Street, and the sinister abandon of Borgiac     Italy.	Other poets have manipulated a great variety of metres and forms; but few have studied the forms and metres which they use so carefully as has Pound.	He was supersaturated in Provençe; he had tramped over most of the country; and the life of the courts where the Troubadours thronged was part of his own life to him.

Nor shall we enter into other phases of Mr.	And the rough, stern beauty of the Anglo-Saxon, we may remark, is at the opposite pole from that of the Provençal and Italian poets to whom Pound had previously devoted his attention.	... And a few lines later comes an example of his favourite     use of spondee, followed by dactyl and spondee, which comes     in strangely and, as we first read it, with the appearance     of discord, but afterwards seems to gain a curious and     distinctive vigour:       "Eyes, dreams, lips, and the night goes."	What     poetry should be, that they are.	Sometimes there is a strange     beating of anapaests when he quickens to his subject; again     and again he unexpectedly ends a line with the second half     of a reverberant hexameter:       "Flesh shrouded, bearing the secret."	Tree you are,   Moss you are,   You are violets with wind above them.	It would be interesting to compare Pound's use of images with Mallarme's; I think it will be found that the former's, by the contrast, will appear always sharp in outline, even if arbitrary and not photographic.
