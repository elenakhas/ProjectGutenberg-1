How could they take him?	.	It seemed the very picture of an Algerian village after a swarm of locusts, a bare, devastated, devoured, and riddled scene; the houses with doors and windows all wide open, even to the little iron gates of the kennels and the latticed shutters of the rabbit-hutches.	.	.	.	A few days before, it had been bitten on the muzzle by a viper, and it had been turned out to graze in a little field of after-grass; and there he was, looking at his masters going away, leaning his swollen head, which gave him the appearance of one of the beasts of the Apocalypse, over the hedge.	[Picture: On the steps by the lock] Near us, moored some fifty or sixty feet from the shore, a dredging-boat reared its black mass above the water, with its barrels and bucket-chain to clear away the sand.	—To the dredger .	.	One day, while crossing the forest of Sénart, I discovered the Hermitage, and for the last ten years I have spent all my summers there.	.	The village seemed to awaken.	All the little details in which I used to take pleasure, like those egotists in disguise—recluses and hermits—I now find despicable.	We impatiently waited for daybreak, not knowing exactly what distance separated us from the land, nor how we should be able to reach it.	.	However, I must make the attempt .	When I am there, the forest surrounds me like an ocean, with the swell of the foliage, the ebb and flow of the breezes, the murmuring softness of a calm.	.	.	A window above the dairy opens cautiously, and I see the cunning, somewhat unkempt head of the farmer appear, with his untrimmed beard, and his small round, suspicious eyes hidden under bushy eyebrows.	The very first Prussian I met on the road I sprang upon like a wild beast and cut his throat with this .	—It always buys tobacco, as good old Guillard used to say.	.	Our journey has failed.	If I harnessed Colaquet, we might go and fetch some flour .	And now, good mother, let us start; and above all, you know what I said to you; try not to cry.	How had I got home?	During the last three months the unhappy village had been in this condition.	The pretty country village, where I had so often breakfasted before a day’s shooting, seemed to be sixty miles farther away .	To-day I have seen no one.	MYSELF.	.	.	I am sure that already the grass is growing across my threshold, and that the invading forest is hemming me closely in.	.	.	.	One would think there was an evil spirit within me that the war has called forth .	I had to bake some bread to-day, and could not summon up courage to do it.	I already saw the Hermitage invaded, searched, my retreat discovered; and I felt angry with that unfortunate peasant for having sought refuge so near me, as if all the forest were not large enough.	However, I am a complete prisoner.	.	.	.	.	In a small brick-floored room behind the kitchen, a green paper had been put up, coloured glass had been let into the window, and a pair of gilt fire-dogs, a round tea-table, and a large arm-chair covered with worn chintz, had been placed in it.	Then, walking slowly, and leaning on a stick, I go round the garden, picking the ripe fruit; and from the long, dry, sunburnt stalks I gather the beans, whose pods burst open and shed their contents through my fingers.	At Port-Courcelles we had the same fear.	[Picture: Overgrown quarry]                                 * * * * *                      [Picture: Robert gathering wood]                                                       _Unknown date_ .	I must even make a confession, Mr. Robert.	The four principal walls remain standing, but mouldering and crumbling at intervals, making on the turf, heaps of red stone quickly re-clothed by a rich and luxuriant vegetation: poppies, barley, stiff-growing plants with regular and pointed leaves, are divided by the stones like inlaid metal-work.	.	if I could only have gone off with them, stuck on my head their ridiculous headgear, and fought in their ranks, under the walls of the good city!	.	I am filled with feelings of indignation, pity, horror, and anger .	.	My wife will leave you our keys.	When my poultry-yard is empty, I shall be able to snare some of those fine cock-pheasants that come round the Hermitage to pick up the grains of buckwheat hidden in the wet soil.	Then I understood the flag, the splinters of wood, the pieces of cast iron, and the smell of burnt powder we had noticed in the cabin.	.	You can do what you will with them .	—I trust you are not going to remain here, Mr. Robert, the good woman called out as she crossed the orchard .	I have cut away just enough of it to be able to open my windows.	It would soon, however, reach it, for in several places the sides of the room were cracked almost down to the level of the waves, and we found ourselves lighted by the leaden reflection of the darkness on the water.	They are firing on Paris, the wretches!	It was a monastery of “Cordeliers,” burnt down in ‘93.	How had I been able to avoid the Uhlans, who swarmed on the highway.	.	.	.	.	In spite of the slight jolting, I found the drive delightful.	.	The enormous gnarled willows of the two islets became in the night so many shoals, that we narrowly escaped.	Yet it seems to me that it must be October.	.	.	The Prussian officers are like our own, they are very fond of playing billiards.	.	I hear something like the snap of a stick in my leg, followed by horrible pain.	Let loose in the room, he quietly went about pecking between the tiles.	Poor man!
