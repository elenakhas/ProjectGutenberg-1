In April I shall see again--In April!	Winds of the white poppy!	The white moon   is up among her scattered stars--   like the bare thighs of   the Police Seargent's wife--among   her five children....   No answer.	Time is a green orchid.	I wanted you!	I married you because I liked your nose.	there is no escape!--   An interminable talking, talking,   talking ... it has happened before.	Teach me, O master.	and come!	Offal!	And they are right.	Ah, March--              Flowers are a tiresome pastime.	And the night passes--and never passes-- OVERTURE TO A DANCE OF LOCOMOTIVES I   Men with picked voices chant the names   of cities in a huge gallery: promises   that pull through descending stairways   to a deep rumbling.	GREAT MULLEN   One leaves his leaves at home   being a mullen and sends up a lighthouse   to peer from: I will have my way,   yellow--A mast with a lantern, ten   fifty, a hundred, smaller and smaller   as they grow more--Liar, liar, liar!	Raising a glass of yellow Rhine wine in the narrow   space just beyond the light-varnished woodwork and   the decorative column between dining-room and hall,   she smiled the smile of water tumbling from one ledge   to another.	Your eyes   are half closed, you are a child,   oh, a sweet one, ready to play   but I will make a man of you and   with love on his shoulder--!	All night they lie together   under her bed's edge.	She will play for her husband.	The colour ran true but the plant is small.	Night is a room   darkened for lovers,   through the jalousies the sun   has sent one gold needle!	It's   the fillip of novelty.	A CELEBRATION   A middle-northern March, now as always--   gusts from the south broken against cold winds--   but from under, as if a slow hand lifted a tide,   it moves--not into April--into a second March,   the old skin of wind-clear scales dropping   upon the mould: this is the shadow projects the tree   upward causing the sun to shine in his sphere.	It's a fire in the blood.	Nimbly the shadows   of my fingers play   unlacing   over shoes and flowers.	My friend on the left who has spent the   whole day in a car the like of which some old fellow   would give to an actress: flower-holders, mirrors,   curtains, plush seats--my friend on the left who is   chairman of the Streets committee of the town council--and   who has spent the whole day studying automobile   fire-engines in neighbouring towns in view of   purchase,--my friend, at the Elks last week at the   breaking-up hymn, signalled for them to let Bill--a   familiar friend of the saloon-keeper--sing out all alone   to the organ--and he did sing!	Clean.	Sighs--!	Here is no question of whiteness,   white as can be, with a purple mole   at the center of each flower.	I pick the hair from her eyes   and watch her misery   with compassion.	It will not do.	Ha!	And in the marshes   the crickets run   on the sunny dike's top and   make burrows there, the water   reflects the reeds and the reeds   move on their stalks and rattle drily.	QUEEN-ANN'S-LACE   Her body is not so white as   anemony petals nor so smooth--nor   so remote a thing.	Joy!	It's   a fire in the blood, willy-nilly!	With excellent precision   the tulip bed   inside the iron fence   upreared its gaudy   yellow, white and red,   rimmed round with grass,   reposedly.	Under the leafy trees   where the suburban streets   lay crossed,   with houses on each corner,   tangled shadows had begun   to join   the roadway and the lawns.	The crackle of a newspaper,   the movement of the troubled coat beside you--   sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep....	And this, a certain July from Iceland:   a young woman of that place   breathed it toward the south.	MEMORY OF APRIL   You say love is this, love is that:   Poplar tassels, willow tendrils   the wind and the rain comb,   tinkle and drip, tinkle and drip--   branches drifting apart.	He storms at your sill with   cooings, with gesticulations, curses!	Come!	Men are not friends where it concerns   a woman?	The birches are opening their leaves one   by one.	Their delicate leaves unfold cold   and separate, one by one.	Thirtyfive years   I lived with my husband.	Love has not even visited this country.	--rivers are tunneled: trestles   cross oozy swampland: wheels repeating   the same gesture remain relatively   stationary: rails forever parallel   return on themselves infinitely.	And these the orange-trees, in blossom--no need   to tell with this weight of perfume in the air.	Porters in red hats run on narrow platforms.	This day has blossomed long enough.	I am crushed.	And amazed my heart leaps   at the thought of love   vast and grey   yearning silently over me.	Wolff is a   terrific smoker: if the telephone goes off at night--so   his curled-haired wife whispers--he rises from bed but   cannot answer till he has lighted a cigarette.	I have wiped out the red night and lit a blaze   instead which will at least warm our hands   and stir up the talk.	It is in this town the saloon flourishes,   the saloon of my friend on the right whose wife has   twice offended with chance words.	He would keep you from sleeping.	Youth!	But she is.	Thus having prepared their buds   against a sure winter   the wise trees   stand sleeping in the cold.	DAISY   The dayseye hugging the earth   in August, ha!	THE DARK DAY   A three-day-long rain from the east--   an interminable talking, talking   of no consequence--patter, patter, patter.	I smile, enter and   shake off the cold.	A masterly caviare sandwich.	Food!	Not twoeight.	Go to sleep to the lunge between foam-crests,   refuse churned in the recoil.	And he made to snatch an orange from the vender's cart.	--A car overturned and two crushed bodies   under it.--Always!	Those fleas that escaped   earth and fire   died by the cold.	When they are in bloom--                           You would waste words   It is clearer to me than if the pink   were on the branch.	One turns the thing over   in his hand and looks   at it from the rear: brownedged,   green and pointed scales   armor his yellow.	The plumtree is white today   with masses of flowers.	APRIL   If you had come away with me   into another state   we had been quiet together.	A GOODNIGHT   Go to sleep--though of course you will not--   to tideless waves thundering slantwise against   strong embankments, rattle and swish of spray   dashed thirty feet high, caught by the lake wind,   scattered and strewn broadcast in over the steady   car rails!	Colored cooks sweating   in a small kitchen.	You are a   dungcake, birdlime on a fencerail.--   I love you, straight, yellow   finger of God pointing to--her!	Offal!	You will not succeed.	Out of the dark change   all day long   rain falls and falls   as if it would never end.	Crash!	I must be   steaming with love, colored   like a flamingo.	It is in this town that the saloon is situated,   close to the railroad track, close as may be, this side   being dry, dry, dry: two people listening on opposite   sides of a wall!--The Day Nursery had sixty-five   babies the week before last, so my wife's eyes shine   and her cheeks are pink and I cannot see a blemish.
