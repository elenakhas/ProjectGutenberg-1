Those strings thou callest from quiet mute to yearn,          Of other hearts did hapless secrets learn,          And thy strange skill will turn          To uses that thy bosom dreams not of:          Ay, summon from their dark and dreadful grove          The chaunting, pale-cheeked votaries of love.	A chaffinch clankt, a robin woke               An eerie stave in the leafless oak.	O foolish one, what wonder thou did'st pine?	I raised my head; smiled too.	The drummers will be drumming; the fiddlers at their thrumming;    Nuns at their beads; the mummers at their mumming;    Heaven's solemn Seraph stoopt weary o'er his summing;    The palsied fingers plucking, the way-worn feet numbing—          And the end of things coming.	And lo!	In vain yelps the wainscot mouse;                In vain beats the hour;                Vacant, his body must drowse                Until daybreak flower—                Staining these walls with its rose,                And the draughts of the morning shall stir                Cold on cold brow, cold hands.	Her sailors, drowned, forgotten, rot in mould,            Or hang in stagnant quiet of the deep;            The brave, the afraid into one silence sold;            Their end a memory fainter than of sleep.	Alas, the futility of care              That, spinning thought to thought, doth weave              An idle argument on the air              We love not, nor believe.	Noonday to night the enigma of thine eyes          Frets with desire their travel-wearied brain,        Till in the vast of dark the ice-cold moon arise                  And pour them peace again;                And with malign mirage uprears an isle          Of fountain and palm, and courts of jasmine and rose,        Whence far decoy of siren throats their souls beguile,                  And maddening fragrance flows.	The linnet sings.	Where the sure hope thy soul would feign?'	In nakedness sit; pierce thy stagnation, and weep;      Or corrupt in thy grave—all Heaven around thee.	Yet, see him, stooping low to naked weed          That meeks its blossom in his anxious eye,          Mark how he grieves, as if his heart did bleed,          And wheels his wondrous features to the sky;          As if, transfigured by so small a grace,          He sought Companion in earth's dwelling-place.	Aloft, on that weed-hung turret, suns                  Smote on her hair—                  Of a gold by Archiac sought,                  Of a gold sea-hid,                  Of a gold that from core of quartz                  No flame shall bid                  Pour into light of the air                  For God's Jews to see.'	2ND STRANGER.	NOT THAT WAY              NO, no.	They passed me, unseeing, a waft of flocking linnets;           Sadly I fared on my way;         And came in my dream to a dreamlike habitation,           Close-shut, festooned and grey.	Flits moth to flower.	Thick-juiced with poison hang those fruits that shine        Where sick phantasmal moonbeams brood and beat,          And dark imaginations ripe the vine.	Yet waste though the shallowing day might seem,             And fainter than hope its rose,             Strangely that speech in my thoughts welled on;             As water in-flows:             Like remembered words once heard in a room             Wherein death kept far-away tryst;             'Not often alone, we two; but thou,             How sorely missed!'	No snowdrop yet its small head nods,                  In winds of winter drear;                  No lark at casement in the sky                  Sings matins shrill and clear;                  Yet in this frozen mirk the Dawn                        Breathes, Spring is here!	While on high from an attic stare                Horrors, in beauty apparelled,                Down the dark air.	Haply on strange roads I shall be, the moorland's peace around me;    Or counting up a fortune to which Destiny hath bound me;    Or—Vanity of Vanities—the honey of the Fair;    Or a greybeard, lost to memory, on the cobbles in my chair—    How shall I know that the end of things is coming?	Yet, whether hazel, grey, or blue,                 Or that even lovelier lilac hue,                 I cannot guess: why—why deny                 Such beauty to the passer-by?	Why have the rains of summer veiled her flowers with their sheen      And this black heart untold?	LONG ago from radiant palace,                 Dream-bemused, in flood of moon,                 Stole the princess Seraphita                 Into forest gloom.	Pine now no more, to pine in vain.	Running water I hear,                        Keeping lugubrious tryst                        With its cresses and grasses and weeds,                        In the white obscure light from the sky.	Each turned a head,               And each its own clear radiance shed               With joy and peace at play.	Yet 'twas their silence breathed only this—               'I love you.'	THE VEIL                 I think and think; yet still I fail—                 Why does this lady wear a veil?	The sea swung by.	Yet transparent as glass these walls,                      If thou lean near.	And the wanderer                Back to flesh house must return.	This is the Inn at the Cross Roads,     Sign of the _Rising Sun_, of the _World's End_:     Ay, O Wanderer, footsore, weary, forsaken,         Knock, and we will open to thee—Friend.	'Happy, forsooth!	Yet, happy beyond words, I marked their sunlit faces,           Stealing soft enchantment from their eyes,         Tears in my own confusing their small image,           Harkening their bead-like cries.	THE SUICIDE                   DID these night-hung houses,                   Of quiet, starlit stone,                   Breathe not a whisper—'Stay,                   Thou unhappy one;                   Whither so secret away?'	Voice after voice in smooth impartial drone         Erects horrific in his darkening brain         A timber framework, where agape, alone         Bright life will kiss good-bye the cheek of Cain.	Couching my cheeks upon my sun-scorched hands,           Down from bare rock I gazed.	Long hours there are,                      When mutely tapping—well,                    Is it to Vacancy                      I these tidings tell?	We speak               A tongue that may earth's secrets tell:               Why further will you seek?'	The night comes.... 'Tis late.	'My mouth breathes love, thou dear.	I saw a crazèd face, did I,                  Stare from the lattice of a mill,                  While the lank sails clacked idly by                  High on the windy hill.	_Who walks with us on the hills?_          WILD BIRD.	Blinded the rooms wherein no foot falls.	Stumble his shadowy feet                Through shine, through mire;                And the flames leap higher.	Vaunt thy rose.	I too                   Tryst with the Atlantic waste.'	'Her name, crazed soul?	Sudden like wolf he cries; and sweats to see         When howls man's soul, it howls inaudibly.	Rent hull, and broken mast,            She sprawls sand-mounded, of sea birds the mock.	And I saw from concealment a company of elf-folk           With faces strangely fair,         Talking their unearthly scattered talk together,           A bind of green-grasses in their hair,         Marvellously gentle, feater far than children,           In gesture, mien and speech,         Hastening onward in translucent shafts of sunshine,           And gossiping each with each.	Yet many a creeping thing                   Its haven has made                   In these least crannies, were falls                   Dark's dew, and noonday shade.	THE WRECK            STORM and unconscionable winds once cast            On grinding shingle, masking gap-toothed rock,            This ancient hulk.	Guard thee.	Our shrouded day                     Dwindles away                 To final black of eve.	'Myriad the lights are,                 Wayworn landsman,             Rocking the dark through                     On the deep:         She alone burns none to prove her _Sleep_.'	Weep a prayer                    For the true and fair.'	FUTILITY              SINK, thou strange heart, unto thy rest.	Silence, as of a virginal laid aside,          Did there abide.	There harbours no wild bird,                     No wanderer strays there;                   Wreathed in mist, sheds pale Ishtar                     Her sorrowful rays there.	'Are we not flesh and blood?	_SOTTO VOCE_                            (To Edward Thomas)               THE haze of noon wanned silver-grey               The soundless mansion of the sun;               The air made visible in his ray,               Like molten glass from furnace run,               Quivered o'er heat-baked turf and stone               And the flower of the gorse burned on—               Burned softly as gold of a child's fair hair               Along each spiky spray, and shed               Almond-like incense in the air               Whereon our senses fed.	Comfort thee, comfort thee.	Wherefore such heavy sighs?'	The claw of the tender bird                   Finds lodgment here;                   Dye-winged butterflies poise;                   Emmet and beetle steer                   Their busy course; the bee                   Drones, laden, near.	Thou givest thyself too strait a room therein.	Nectarous those flowers, yet with venom sweet.	Lean closer, then;                      Lay palm on stony wall.	'Poor hands, poor feeble wings,                   Folded, a-droop, O sad!	'Cracked my voice and broken my wing,                     God knows.'	CRAZED                  I know a pool where nightshade preens                  Her poisonous fruitage in the moon;                  Where the frail aspen her shadow leans                  In midnight cold a-swoon.	FOG               STAGNANT this wintry gloom.	Inland wellsprings are sweet;                     But to lips, parched and dry,                   Salt, salt is the savour                     Of these; faint their sigh.	Her eyes, it's plain, survey with ease                 Whatever to glance upon they please.	He gloats in beastlike trance.	While the birds in her tresses make merry;              Burns the Sun in the skies.	Ay, at danger slake          Thy thirst, lest life in thee should, sickening, quail;        But not toward nightmare goad a mind awake,          Nor to forbidden horizons bend thy sail—        Seductive outskirts whence in trance prolonged          Thy gaze, at stretch of what is sane-secure,        Dreams out on steeps by shapes demoniac thronged          And vales wherein alone the dead endure.	O Self!	And your cry faints out in my mind.
