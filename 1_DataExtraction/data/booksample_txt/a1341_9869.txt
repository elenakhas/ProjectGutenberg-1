the juice of a grape crushed under the foot suffices to dissipate the deepest sorrow and to break all the invisible threads that the fates weave about our pathway.	Behold what is found at the bottom of the glass when the nectar of the gods has been drained; behold the corpse of love."	"It is true; what is your meaning?"	One day I felt like arming myself with a knife and threatening to kill them if they did not tell me why they were so sad; another day I turned all this fury against myself.	"Sir, I am afraid of no one, and I have told you what you ought to know."	He did not find her; I sent him to her house.	"You hope so!	Do you wish to set out for Switzerland?	I fell on my knees and wept, but she took my hand and said: 'Do not weep, do not weep!'	"Sir," he said, "you exhibited signs of anger which it does not become a man of my character to resent.	"But tell me," she said, "is it irrevocable?	All this time I had seen nothing but her face.	Ah!	What do you know about it?"	Let us decide.	My thoughts were so confused that I had no recollection of what had happened.	Yes, she has traversed these mountains and valleys through storm and fair weather, she goes hither and thither, bearing life and hope wherever they fail, holding in her hand that fragile cup, caressing her goat as she passes.	There breathes under the wind of those dismal forests that are called secrets of the body, one of those mysteries that the angels of destruction whisper in the ear of night as it descends upon the earth.	We repeated that we would despise the world, that we would yield nothing, that we would not change our manner of life.	He surely knew my face, and whether he knew it or not, a man who sees another approaching him, ought, at least, to wait for him.	"Civilization thwarts the ends of nature.	I have, after all, a pretty mistress; she has given herself to a libertine, let her take me for what I am."	"Listen to me," she said; "I know all; but if it has come to that, Octave, you must go away.	In the morning, I passed entire hours in the contemplation of nature.	What have I told you?	I revolved in my mind all the things I had heard and seen; from time to time, I went to the door and cast my eyes over our trunks which had been piled against the wall for a month; I opened them and examined the contents so carefully packed away by those delicate little hands; I listened to the sound of passing carriages; the slightest noise made me tremble.	I have been weak because I have suffered.	"My friend," I said to myself, "behold what has been sent you.	I sat still, as though awakened from a dream, and began to repeat his questions.	It seemed that, once started, she had to accomplish a difficult but sacred task; she walked in front like a soldier, her arms swinging, her voice ringing through the woods in song; suddenly she turned, came to me, and kissed me.	There was no mark of suffering on her face: she was resting from her sorrow as from great fatigue and seemed not even to remember it.	She arose and stood behind me.	There would be in me something that resembled that man but for the fact that my favorite bones were those of a well-beloved skeleton; they were the debris of my love, all that remained of the past.	CHAPTER IX IF I were a jeweler, and had in my stock a pearl necklace that I wished to give a friend, it seems to me I would take great pleasure in placing it about her neck with my own hands; but if I were that friend, I would rather die than snatch the necklace from the jeweler's hand.	--"Why, when that man looks at her, does she seem to fear to meet his glance?"	Which of us had lived?	I had no sooner read these words when a flash of light came to me.	She had it in her possession not an hour ago.	Although I had followed my friends into all manner of dissipation, I had no desire to resume my place in the world of society.	It seemed to me that her face wore a grieved expression.	I entered and saw my father dead.	What do you mean by first comer?	"He left about midnight."	When Smith left us in the evening, we either kept silence or talked of him.	We separated at these words, and the coldness with which she had expressed her resolution saddened me more than a refusal.	If you love her, forget her; if she is pretty and you do not love her, keep her for your pleasure; there will always be time to leave her, if it is merely a matter of beauty, and one is worth as much as another."	I ground the pieces under my feet.	Madame Pierson soon arrived, preceding the servant; she descended rapidly, and did not see me in the darkness; I stepped up to her and touched her arm.	I cried.	I cried, impatiently.	You murderer!	As zinc, that demi-metal, drawn from the blue vein where it lies sleeping, attracts to itself a ray of light when placed near a piece of green leather, thus Brigitte's kisses gradually awakened in my heart what had been buried there.	And why not?	I dissuaded her from her plans, I told her what I had just done and why I had not carried out my first impulse.	My reply did not please him; he frowned and changed the subject.	he repeated in surprise.	I cried, "even that consolation is refused me!"	"That is woman as we have made her; such are your mistresses.	The night was beautiful; the moon was setting and the stars shone brightly in a field of deep azure.	Then a gust of wind passes, and behold the smallest of these arrows, the very lightest and most futile, is carried beyond our vision, beyond the horizon, to the dwelling-place of God himself.	thou principle of life!	I found a narrow room where workmen who had but one shirt, rented a suit for the evening for twenty _sous_, police stationed at the door and starving wretches staking a crust of bread against a pistol-shot.	Give me a last kiss."	In the morning, music, reading; in the evening, cards with the aunt as in the days of my father; and she, always there smiling, her presence filling my heart.	Brigitte accorded me a timid greeting; she could see her troubled image in my eyes.	I asked myself.	He replied that he did not know, unless it was because she had been rosy and the name had clung to her.	I know that you love me, Brigitte, and you are safer here than a king in his palace."	What frightful power over your irritable nerves has that life you have led, that such insults mount to your lips in spite of you?	She listlessly extended her arm and filled it to the brim with Cyprian and a sweetened Oriental wine which I afterward found so bitter on the deserted Lido.	O, Heaven!	A journey she was compelled to take, forced her to confide me to the care of my future father-in-law.	he asked.	What joy!	In truth, his brain resembles the dungeons of the Inquisition whose walls are covered with so many instruments of torture, that one is dazed and asks whether these horrible contrivances he sees before him are pincers or playthings.	"I have stopped my ears and am looking at it."	Had he recognized me at the opera or had he not, had he shed tears for some unknown reason, what would it matter so long as I was happy?	Yes, more than you love me, alas!	It is true that these whirlpools are traversed, and have been since the beginning of the world, by seven personages who are always the same: the first is called hope; the second, conscience; the third, opinion; the fourth, desire; the fifth, sorrow; the sixth, pride; and the seventh, man.	I went to bed with a sense of comfort and happiness, such as I had not known for a long time.	She had often formed one of our party when I called on my mistress in the evening!	Then, blase and corrupted, with no human sentiment, not even disgust, she meets a fine youth with raven locks, ardent eye and hopeful heart; she recalls her own youth, she remembers what she has suffered, and telling him the story of her life, she teaches him to shun love.	Thus the poets who understand life, after having known much of love, more or less transitory, after having felt that sublime exaltation which passion can for the moment inspire, deducting from human nature all elements which degrade it, created the mysterious names which through the ages are passed from lip to lip: Daphne and Chloe, Hero and Leander, Pyramus and Thisbe.
