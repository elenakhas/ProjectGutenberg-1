And then, when Jeree got a little boring, there was Sybil in the accounting department.	Naturally, we only act as agents, you might say.

The only physical difference apparent even to an expert was the tiny finger-depression buried in the hair above his ear.	He builds it up and maintains it against assault in the very teeth of his wife's natural instinct to clean, poke, pry and rearrange things.	I told the man so rather bluntly.	I couldn't very well complain to the cops that my wife had run off with an android.	The rest of the time, George Prime cooled his heels in his closet.
