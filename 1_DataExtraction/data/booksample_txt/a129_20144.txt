«Rejoice, my friend, while I the means impart, 595   To gain his love or drive him from my heart:       A place there is where Æthiopia ends,       And into ocean's lap the sun descends;       Where Atlas on his spreading shoulders bears,       And turns the shining glory of the spheres.	340   These rising tow'rs--If satisfied with these,       You barter glory for ignoble ease,       Your injur'd heir--your young Ascanius view,       Rome and th' Italian reign to him are due.»       While thus the God convey'd what Jove resolv'd, 345   From human eyes in air his form dissolved.	But Love shall wind this torrent from its course,       And soil his glories in their limpid sourse;       Spite of the virtues which adorn his mind,       In am'rous chains that haughty spirit bind.	But will Jove's Queen who guards the nuptial vow, 460   Will mighty Jove himself, such deeds allow?	260   Such modest candour temper'd manly sense,       When Mornay censur'd, none could take offense;       For truth by him, in winning form convey'd,       Was but the virtue which his life display'd.	what pangs your bosom tore,       What sighs you heav'd, as on the moving shore,       The busy crews, assembling in your sight,       With dashing waves, their horrid shouts unite.	245   This, all around Fame glories to diffuse,       And to Iarba next her flight pursues,       To fan the flame that in his bosom glows.	*       *       *       *       *                                THE                              HENRIAD.	Have I disturb'd his father's sacred shade,       That to be heard--not mere--in vain I've pray'd?	Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.	Her aching eyes did broken slumbers close,       AEneas like a vengeful fury rose: 580   Alone--forsaken--distant from her home,       Driv'n o'er the desert--she appears to roam       With sinking steps,--abandoned--left behind,       Thro' burning sands her native Tyre to find.	To life, to love, the god recall'd the fair,       And bid young Hope repeat the tender pray'r.	If he, unmov'd, such' proferr'd greatness sees,       Renouncing glory for ignoble ease.     }	Thro' the wide desert fierce Barceans roam:  55   Why need I mention from our former home,       The deadly war, a brother's threats prepare?	Great God, whoe'er you be       Thy words again exulting we obey.	Cast upon my shore,       Shipwreck'd, distress'd, a friendly aid I bore:       Himself, his fleet, his friends, from ruin drew,       Nay, foolish woman!	Ill fated Queen!	Of the sad deed be left no conscious trace--"       She ceas'd and smil'd,--but death was in her face.	Around her dress he threw that careless air, 195   It seem'd what Nature's self would choose to wear;       Her auburn locks in easy tresses play'd,       Now hid her snowy neck, and now betray'd;       No muse can paint what playful zephyr show'd,       Nor tell the charm that modesty bestow'd: 200   Not the stiff airs that prudish virtue arm,       The foes of love, the bane of ev'ry charm:       Sweet, bashful grace, that bends the timid eye,       Spreads o'er the glowing cheek a heav'nly dye,       With soft respect extatic rapture blends, 205   And heavn's pure bliss to Love triumphant lends.	why doubt of what is plain?

Or when thy thunder rolls       Do causeless fears, O Father, shake our souls?	That new in grief no lover should succeed,       Tyrians in vain, in vain Iarba plead;       That every chief of Afric's wide domain,       In triumphs proud, should learn to sue in vain;  50   'Twas well; but why a mutual flame withstand?	'Tis me you fly--Oh, by your sacred vow,       By these sad tears, (they're all that's left me now 390   To move your heart); by all our solemn ties,       By what I've suffer'd, by our shortliv'd joys,       If gratitude has giv'n me any right,       If any charm in me once gave delight,       Do not desert the wreck yourself have made, 395   Nor from my falling state withdraw your aid.	Were it not fix'd, determin'd in my mind,       That me no more the nuptial tye shall bind,       Since Death deceiv'd the first fond flame I knew:  25   Were Hymen's rites less odious to my view,       To this one fault perhaps I might give way;       For must I own it?	Nor race divine,       Nor Dardan sire, nor Goddess mother thine!	Whose purple sail before Augustus flew,       Who lost the world for Egypt's queen and you?	The Queen her sacred off'ring in her hands, 645   With one foot bar'd, before the altar stands;       Her zone unbound releas'd her flowing vest;       The conscious gods her dying words attest,       The start that bear our fate, and if above       A pow'r remains, that pities injur'd love.	Then, when you call on injure!	A charm invincible he calls around,       Their tender boughs enchanted myrtles spread,       Rise thro' the earth and wave their taper head: 210   Deluded mortals seek the tempting shades,       The secret charm their languid sense invades,       Around, a stream in lulling manner flows,       Of deep forgetfulness, of soft repose;       Bound in the chain no more they seek to move; 215   Fame, honor, duty, what are you to Love?	Can you forget who owns this hostile land?	Non ita certandi cupidus, quam propter amorem     Quod te imitari aveo---- I have the honor to be with great respect, Your most obedient humble servant, P. L.                                 PREFACE.	Whereas it would seem that the situation of her mind is meant to be described before she addresses him, rather as wild and frantic with doubt and fear, than actuated by rage.	A worthy object, truly, for his care!	How could d'Etree with such a pow'r contest!	While Dido, now with rising cares opprest,       Indulg'd the pain; the flame within her breast       In silence prey'd, and burn'd in every vein.	380   Has love no charm, has plighted faith no tie?	705   Woman's a thing so variable and light!	Two mighty gods--one woman have undone!	After two brillant ages of literature the French language did not, till you appeared, possess one translation of the great masterpieces of antiquity, which might fairly be said to have attained the rank of a classical work: while the English had been long enriched with such translations of most of them, as will like yours, in all probability share the immortality of their originals.	Venus, aware of the deceit, appears in a very complimentary style to give into it, and consents to her projects.	Graceful on high the god o'er Cynthio glides,       His wanton locks with pliant gold divides,       With tender foliage crowns his radiant hair; 190   Wide sounds the dart bu spreading shoulders bear.	those eyes that view the Moor 260   From painted coaches full libations pour,       See they not this?	By friendship guided, gen'rous Mornay came       Where loiter'd Henry, mindless of his fame; 275   The artful god prolong'd the am'rous trance,       And in her hero rul'd the fate of France.

Æneas, after escaping from the destruction of Troy and a long series of adventures by sea and land, is driven by a storm raised by the hatred of Juno on the coast of Affrica, where he is received by Dido, in the new town of Carthage, which she was building, after her flight from the cruelty of her brother in law Pigmalion, who had murdered her husband Sicheus.--Venus dreading for her son Æneas, the influence of Juno upon the mind of Dido, makes Cupid assume the forme of his child Julus or Ascanius, and raise in the bosom of the Queen the most ungovernable passion for Æneas.	SIR, After reading with infinite pleasure your masterly translations of Virgil, I have been led into a train of reflection on the mechanism of words, and on the manners, the ideas, and pursuits of Nations in as much as they frequently give rise to the difference of character which we remark in their language.	There stands the priestess with dishevell'd hair;       (Her voice like thunder shakes the trembling air)       Thrice on the hundred gods aloud she calls, 635   Deep night and chaos, thrice her Voice appalls;       The triple form that Virgin Dian wears,       Infernal Hecate's threefold nature hears.	Here all alike the sweet delusion share,       And breathe delicious poison with the air.	What mean these structures in a hostile place?	What hopes deceitful from his mind efface       Th' Ausonian offspring, the Lavinian land?	By friendship guided, gen'rous Mornay came       Where loiter'd Henry, mindless of his fame; 275   The artful god prolong'd the am'rous trance,       And in her hero rul'd the fate of France.	520   Now grant me, Anna, grant this one request!

Oh had I thought such ills could e'er ensue       Perhaps I should have learn'd to bear them too?	While yet she spoke, she trembling turn'd away,       Broke from his sight, and shun'd the light of day.	But if--which way!	Not only have the easy elegance and courtly air of your verses displayed the French tongue in these respects worthy of your original; but have inclined me to think that they have raised it near the highest pitch of perfection of which it is at present capable, in the translation of a Latin poet.	U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.	Crush'd by his hand, behold my serpents die!	O thou for faith, for piety rever'd!	Herself the goblet lovely Dido bears,       Her graceful arm the sacred vessel rears;  80   And where the horns above the forehead join,       Upon the snow-white heifer pours the wine:       Before the god with awful grace she bows,       Moves round the altar rich with daily vows,       Hangs o'er the victim, in its bosom pries,  85   And through the breathing entrail darts her eyes.	Scarce had she gain'd the charming dang'rous years,       A pow'r too sure, when rising passion bears.	670   Oh!	shar'd my kingdom too, 465   Now,--my rage to very madness tends:       Now Lycian fates, now Phæbus he pretends,     } Nay mighty Jove himself, thro' flitting air     } Sends down a god his dread command to bear.     }	The fee is      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.	When Juno view'd the tumult in her breast,       That Fame with Passion could no more contest,       She sought the Cyprian queen, «What praise, what fame» 126   She cried, «what glorious triumph you may claim,       What high renown, for you and for your son!	Through misty air as nearer earth he drew,       Cutting the winds and whirling sands, he flew 320   Like birds, that hov'ring o'er the fishy main,       Drop from the sky', and skim the watry plain.

Soon thro' the Lybian towns, Fame blew the deed;       Fame, that outstrips all other ills in speed,       That feeds on motion, strengthens as she flies, 225   Weak, timid first, but soon of monstrous size,       Her feet on earth, amid the clouds her head.	Still lean'd his heart the faults of men to bear, 265   While reason told him, all men had their share;       But mid surrounding vices ever pure,       Nor ease nor pleasure could his soul allure.	But now the ripen'd project chill'd her soul;       Thro' starting blood her eyeballs burning roll;       Her cheek convuls'd with spots of livid red, 790   All pale and ghastly, Death approaching spread.	1.E.4.

Had Troy herself existed, who would brave       For Troy herself, the treach'rous wintry wave.	No sameness there the varied bliss destroy'd,       No languor chill'd, no forward pleasure cloy'd;       Each wish attain'd, another wish inspires; 280   Each new enjoyment led to new desires:       Such vary'd ways to please, love taught d'Etree,       Nor time nor habit stole one charm away.	Sure of his triumph with such beauty's aid,       Full in the monarch's sight he plac'd the maid.	And from the filly's infant forehead shorn       A powerful philter from the mother torn.	145   Would Fortune friendly on our project wait.	and rites too fondly paid!
