'I'll consider whether I am or not,' he pleasantly replied.	Conjecture was directed to the question how Bellston had got there; and conjecture alone could give an explanation.	Then the merry guests tumbled through doors at the further end, and dancing began.	'You are quite positive?'

'I should like to live in London best,' murmured Picotee, her head sinking mournfully to one side.	The baritone started at the unexpected sight, but recovering from his surprise said, 'Very well, as you will,' though perhaps his tone showed a slight want of confidence.	'By God!	He musingly looked out of the window.	'For I see what you don't, that it is a good and flourishing match for you; a very honourable offer in Mr. Darton.

By a sorry but unconscious misapplication of sound and wide reasoning did the active mind of Ethelberta thus find itself a solace.	'There, that's just it!	It happened to be market-day, and Nicholas, having postponed the engagements which called him thither to keep the appointment with her in the Sallows, rushed off at the end of the afternoon to attend to them as well as he could.
