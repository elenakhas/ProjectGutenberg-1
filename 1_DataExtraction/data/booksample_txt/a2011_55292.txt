I knaw who wears 'em in this 'ouse, an' it ain't the old man.	Teddy.	I like a man that can take 'is liquor.	(_He rises._) Polly.	Teddy (_dogmatically_).	Yer not eatin' much.	Yus.	(_Teddy and Liza enter, suspicious and reluctant.	Lisa.	'E's all right.	I ain't.	Comin' 'ere an' whistlin' abart the 'ouse as if yer felt feared o' bein' seen.	'Ere, I say, Liza, yer not offended are yer?	Liza didn't never 'ave much ter say for 'erself out in street.	I'll raise a lump on 'is thick 'ead big enough for 'im to 'ang 'is 'at on.	Polly (_detaining him with her hand on his arm_).	That's right enough, Teddy, but I don't like looks of this.	(_Finishing the removal of ironing from table._) Now, Liza, get a move on.	Polly (_grimly_).	(_Teddy empties his glass._) That's better.	Fond of yer, I reckon, too, eh, Liza?	Polly (_mimicking_).	I'm deep in love an' I'll not take no for an answer.	(_Teddy shifts uncomfortably._) But that's all over now.	Wot made yer tell me they'd be against it if they knew'?	(_Whistle sounds off l._) Andrew (_moving to door c._).	Oh, I see.	Andrew.	Polly.	Polly.	Too fond to part.	That's 'er artfulness.	(_Sitting and putting his thumbs in his waistcoat armholes._) Yer never know yer luck.	(_Cordially._) Well, yer'll 'ave no need to carry on that road now.	Teddy.	Trust a girl to be careful when she's got 'er eye on a man.	Yer bally well beggin' me to 'ave 'er.	Yus.	No.	Yer'd 'ave a foine belly ache, an all, if 'er flesh were as sour as 'er temper.	Polly.	Teddy.	(_Enter l. Liza, a girl of sixteen, with black alpaca skirt to her ankles, gaudy stockings, cheap "flash" shoes, a purple blouse and a hat with coster feathers._) Polly.	Teddy.	Make 'im think yer'd be glad to get shut of 'er.	Liza.	Liza ull go the way o' all flesh when 'er time comes.	Garn, yer've no need to colour up like that if yer did forget 'em.	Polly.	I'll tell yer wot I'm thinkin.	Creditin' anything a feller tells yer when 'e's lurin' yer to 'is arms.	Yer've got a sight better kind of a man than yer sisters ever 'ad.	Yer've only to go in and win.	I've 'ad enough.	That gas.	I'm thinkin' there's somethin' wrong with 'er or yer'd not be so humble abart it.	I dunno what the world's comin' to.	Yer drink as if it feared yer.	Yer didn't 'elp blokes wot come after yer other girls only with yer old man's strap.	Hark to that now.	Liza (_timidly_).	I must keep on the sweet side of yer mother.	Teddy.	Me an' yer didn't arsk our old 'uns for leave to start courtin'.	They didn't set abort it this road with my sisters' fellers.	Polly hands a chair out._) Sit yer down.	Polly (_roughly_).	Yus.	Yer'll not go out this night.	(_A whistle pipes a little tune at back._) Rot it!	She leaves door ajar without entering._) Polly.	'Ere, where's Mr. Bettesworth?	Polly.	Now, yer'll ave a bit of bacon?	I don't call to moind 'avin said I'd wed yer.	Teddy.	Polly.	Andrew.	That don't signify.	Liza.	Ain't there no more in jug?	Bustle round, girl.	I tell you wot, Mr. Dawson, yer slip in fur yer dinner on Sunday.
