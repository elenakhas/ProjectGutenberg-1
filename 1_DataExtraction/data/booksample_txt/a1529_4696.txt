She, all those human figures breathing there,  Beheld as living spirits--to her eyes                         _570  The naked beauty of the soul lay bare,  And often through a rude and worn disguise  She saw the inner form most bright and fair--  And then she had a charm of strange device,  Which, murmured on mute lips with tender tone,                _575  Could make that spirit mingle with her own.

'And ye with them will perish, one by one;--  If I must sigh to think that this shall be,  If I must weep when the surviving Sun                         _235  Shall smile on your decay--oh, ask not me  To love you till your little race is run;  I cannot die as ye must--over me  Your leaves shall glance--the streams in which ye dwell  Shall be my paths henceforth, and so--farewell!'	23.	32.	73.	These were the pranks she played among the cities             _665  Of mortal men, and what she did to Sprites  And Gods, entangling them in her sweet ditties  To do her will, and show their subtle sleights,  I will declare another time; for it is  A tale more fit for the weird winter nights                   _670  Than for these garish summer days, when we  Scarcely believe much more than we can see.	_600  70.	The brinded lioness led forth her young,  That she might teach them how they should forego  Their inborn thirst of death; the pard unstrung  His sinews at her feet, and sought to know                    _100  With looks whose motions spoke without a tongue  How he might be as gentle as the doe.	Mute, breathing, beating, warm, and undecaying,               _610  Like one asleep in a green hermitage,  With gentle smiles about its eyelids playing,  And living in its dreams beyond the rage  Of death or life; while they were still arraying  In liveries ever new, the rapid, blind                        _615  And fleeting generations of mankind.	76.

Aurora, what wouldst thou have given  For such a charm when Tithon became gray?	A haven beneath whose translucent floor  The tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably,  And around which the solid vapours hoar,                      _435  Based on the level waters, to the sky  Lifted their dreadful crags, and like a shore  Of wintry mountains, inaccessibly  Hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray,  And hanging crags, many a cove and bay.

And when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended  From the white pinnacles of that cold hill,  She passed at dewfall to a space extended,                    _275  Where in a lawn of flowering asphodel  Amid a wood of pines and cedars blended,  There yawned an inextinguishable well  Of crimson fire--full even to the brim,  And overflowing all the margin trim.

And where within the surface of the river  The shadows of the massy temples lie,  And never are erased--but tremble ever                        _515  Like things which every cloud can doom to die,  Through lotus-paven canals, and wheresoever  The works of man pierced that serenest sky  With tombs, and towers, and fanes, 'twas her delight  To wander in the shadow of the night.

By Moeris and the Mareotid lakes,                             _505  Strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors,  Where naked boys bridling tame water-snakes,  Or charioteering ghastly alligators,  Had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes  Of those huge forms--within the brazen doors                  _510  Of the great Labyrinth slept both boy and beast,  Tired with the pomp of their Osirian feast.	The silver noon into that winding dell,  With slanted gleam athwart the forest tops,  Tempered like golden evening, feebly fell;                    _355  A green and glowing light, like that which drops  From folded lilies in which glow-worms dwell,  When Earth over her face Night's mantle wraps;  Between the severed mountains lay on high,  Over the stream, a narrow rift of sky.

But her choice sport was, in the hours of sleep,  To glide adown old Nilus, where he threads  Egypt and Aethiopia, from the steep  Of utmost Axume, until he spreads,                            _500  Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep,  His waters on the plain: and crested heads  Of cities and proud temples gleam amid,  And many a vapour-belted pyramid.	The priests would write an explanation full,                  _625  Translating hieroglyphics into Greek,  How the God Apis really was a bull,  And nothing more; and bid the herald stick  The same against the temple doors, and pull  The old cant down; they licensed all to speak                 _630  Whate'er they thought of hawks, and cats, and geese,  By pastoral letters to each diocese.	See paragraph 1.C below.	14.	The king would dress an ape up in his crown  And robes, and seat him on his glorious seat,  And on the right hand of the sunlike throne                   _635  Would place a gaudy mock-bird to repeat  The chatterings of the monkey.--Every one  Of the prone courtiers crawled to kiss the feet  Of their great Emperor, when the morning came,  And kissed--alas, how many kiss the same!	46.	_480  55.	1.B.	16.	And when the wizard lady would ascend                         _385  The labyrinths of some many-winding vale,  Which to the inmost mountain upward tend--  She called 'Hermaphroditus!'	- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm      License.

They framed the imperial tent of their great Queen            _465  Of woven exhalations, underlaid  With lambent lightning-fire, as may be seen  A dome of thin and open ivory inlaid  With crimson silk--cressets from the serene  Hung there, and on the water for her tread                    _470  A tapestry of fleece-like mist was strewn,  Dyed in the beams of the ascending moon.	31.

She spoke and wept:--the dark and azure well  Sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears,  And every little circlet where they fell  Flung to the cavern-roof inconstant spheres  And intertangled lines of light:--a knell                     _245  Of sobbing voices came upon her ears  From those departing Forms, o'er the serene  Of the white streams and of the forest green.	- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days      of receipt of the work.	1.E.

Mortals found  That on those days the sky was calm and fair,  And mystic snatches of harmonious sound  Wandered upon the earth where'er she passed,                  _495  And happy thoughts of hope, too sweet to last.	And ever as she went, the Image lay  With folded wings and unawakened eyes;  And o'er its gentle countenance did play  The busy dreams, as thick as summer flies,  Chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay,                 _365  And drinking the warm tears, and the sweet sighs  Inhaling, which, with busy murmur vain,  They had aroused from that full heart and brain.	--and the pale  And heavy hue which slumber could extend  Over its lips and eyes, as on the gale                        _390  A rapid shadow from a slope of grass,  Into the darkness of the stream did pass.	And then it winnowed the Elysian air  Which ever hung about that lady bright,  With its aethereal vans--and speeding there,  Like a star up the torrent of the night,  Or a swift eagle in the morning glare                         _405  Breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight,  The pinnace, oared by those enchanted wings,  Clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs.	53.	A sexless thing it was, and in its growth  It seemed to have developed no defect                         _330  Of either sex, yet all the grace of both,--  In gentleness and strength its limbs were decked;  The bosom swelled lightly with its full youth,  The countenance was such as might select  Some artist that his skill should never die,                  _335  Imaging forth such perfect purity.	63.	And then the Witch would let them take no ill:  Of many thousand schemes which lovers find,  The Witch found one,--and so they took their fill  Of happiness in marriage warm and kind.	1.E.5.	1.E.8.	And there lay Visions swift, and sweet, and quaint,  Each in its thin sheath, like a chrysalis,  Some eager to burst forth, some weak and faint  With the soft burthen of intensest bliss.

Which when the lady knew, she took her spindle                _145  And twined three threads of fleecy mist, and three  Long lines of light, such as the dawn may kindle  The clouds and waves and mountains with; and she  As many star-beams, ere their lamps could dwindle  In the belated moon, wound skilfully;                         _150  And with these threads a subtle veil she wove--  A shadow for the splendour of her love.	And ever down the prone vale, like a cloud  Upon a stream of wind, the pinnace went:                      _370  Now lingering on the pools, in which abode  The calm and darkness of the deep content  In which they paused; now o'er the shallow road  Of white and dancing waters, all besprent  With sand and polished pebbles:--mortal boat                  _375  In such a shallow rapid could not float.	26.	1.E.6.	68.	This boat she moored upon her fount, and lit  A living spirit within all its frame,  Breathing the soul of swiftness into it.	And odours in a kind of aviary  Of ever-blooming Eden-trees she kept,                         _170  Clipped in a floating net, a love-sick Fairy  Had woven from dew-beams while the moon yet slept;  As bats at the wired window of a dairy,  They beat their vans; and each was an adept,  When loosed and missioned, making wings of winds,             _175  To stir sweet thoughts or sad, in destined minds.	Her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device,           _185  The works of some Saturnian Archimage,  Which taught the expiations at whose price  Men from the Gods might win that happy age  Too lightly lost, redeeming native vice;  And which might quench the Earth-consuming rage               _190  Of gold and blood--till men should live and move  Harmonious as the sacred stars above;  19.
