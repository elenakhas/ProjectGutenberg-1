***** LESLEY CASTLE LETTER the FIRST is from Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL.	EDWARD the 4th This Monarch was famous only for his Beauty and his Courage, of which the Picture we have here given of him, and his undaunted Behaviour in marrying one Woman while he was engaged to another, are sufficient proofs.	"Law, Lady Scudamore replied I blushing how can you think of such a thing?"	I should like to see the girl married and Cleveland has a very good estate.	Our visits therefore to Dunbeath, were now less frequent and by far less agreable than they used to be.	When we arrived at Warleigh, poor Augusta could scarcely breathe, while Margaret was all Life and Rapture.	Pistoletta) Pray papa how far is it to London?	***** THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND FROM THE REIGN OF HENRY THE 4TH TO THE DEATH OF CHARLES THE 1ST BY A PARTIAL, PREJUDICED, AND IGNORANT HISTORIAN.	I had wept over her every Day--had bathed her sweet face with my tears and had pressed her fair Hands continually in mine--.	The Jewels I should imagine too will undoubtedly be hers, and there is too much reason to think that she will preside at her Husbands table in preference to his Daughter.	Can it be that I have a greater affection for Willoughby than I had for his amiable predecessors?	As soon as we had thus happily disencumbered ourselves from the weight of so much money, we began to think of returning to our Mothers, but accidentally hearing that they were both starved to Death, we gave over the design and determined to engage ourselves to some strolling Company of Players, as we had always a turn for the Stage.	Sophia shreiked and fainted on the ground--I screamed and instantly ran mad--.	Enviable Mortal!	H. T. Austen L105.	But still I am not without apprehensions of your being shortly obliged to degrade yourself in your own eyes by seeking a support for your wife in the Generosity of Sir Edward.” “Never, never Augusta will I so demean myself.	That Philippa still retaining her affection for her ungratefull Husband, had followed him to Scotland and generally accompanied him in his little Excursions to Sterling.	Though it is an improvable Estate--.	The Estate near Aberdeen which my brother possesses by the bounty of his great Uncle independant of Sir George, was entirely sufficient to support him and my Sister in Elegance and Ease.	(said she) the servants are out.” “I think we had.” (replied I.)	Many have been the cares and vicissitudes of my past life, my beloved Ellinor, and the only consolation I feel for their bitterness is that on a close examination of my conduct, I am convinced that I have strictly deserved them.	When we arrived at the town where we were to Breakfast, I was determined to speak with Philander and Gustavus, and to that purpose as soon as I left the Carriage, I went to the Basket and tenderly enquired after their Health, expressing my fears of the uneasiness of their situation.	What cannot you get a partner?	my Laura (replied she hastily withdrawing her Eyes from a momentary glance at the sky) do not thus distress me by calling my Attention to an object which so cruelly reminds me of my Augustus's blue sattin waistcoat striped in white!	Tho' I do not profess giving many dates, yet as I think it proper to give some and shall of course make choice of those which it is most necessary for the Reader to know, I think it right to inform him that her letter to the King was dated on the 6th of May.	You are Venus herself.	Adeiu my dear Charlotte; Matilda unites in best wishes to you, and Eloisa, with yours ever M. L. LETTER the SIXTH LADY LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL Lesley-Castle March 20th We arrived here my sweet Freind about a fortnight ago, and I already heartily repent that I ever left our charming House in Portman-square for such a dismal old weather-beaten Castle as this.	WE soon saw through his character.	But never shall I be able so far to conquer my tender sensibility as to enquire after him.	We see little of Sir George, who is almost always at the gaming-table.	“Do you intend staying long in this part of England Miss Grenville?” “Yes Ma'am, some time I beleive.” “But how will Mr and Mrs Grenville bear your absence?” “They are neither of them alive Ma'am.” This was an answer I did not expect--I was quite silenced, and never felt so awkward in my Life---.	When we arrived at Edinburgh Sir Edward told me that as the Widow of his son, he desired I would accept from his Hands of four Hundred a year.	I have been a perjured witness in every public tryal for these last twelve years; and I have forged my own Will.	"Well, then, in the first place; they are both so horribly tall!"	The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.	I executed my Plan with great Punctuality.	So much so, that they inspired me with a great curiosity to know the history of her Life, who were her Parents, where she came from, and what had befallen her, for it was then only known that she was a relation of Mr Evelyn, and that her name was Grenville.	(cried I) how canst thou thus undauntedly endeavour to sully the spotless reputation of such bright Excellence?	LETTER the FOURTH From a YOUNG LADY rather impertinent to her freind We dined yesterday with Mr Evelyn where we were introduced to a very agreable looking Girl his Cousin.	Accordingly we offered our services to one and were accepted; our Company was indeed rather small, as it consisted only of the Manager his wife and ourselves, but there were fewer to pay and the only inconvenience attending it was the Scarcity of Plays which for want of People to fill the Characters, we could perform.	To this purpose we therefore divided it into nine parcels, one of which we devoted to Victuals, the 2d to Drink, the 3d to Housekeeping, the 4th to Carriages, the 5th to Horses, the 6th to Servants, the 7th to Amusements, the 8th to Cloathes and the 9th to Silver Buckles.	Alas why are not Edward and Augustus here to enjoy its Beauties with us?” “Ah!	“And whither shall we go (said I) to shelter us from either?” “To that white Cottage.” (replied she pointing to a neat Building which rose up amidst the grove of Elms and which I had not before observed--) I agreed and we instantly walked to it--we knocked at the door--it was opened by an old woman; on being requested to afford us a Night's Lodging, she informed us that her House was but small, that she had only two Bedrooms, but that However we should be wellcome to one of them.	Consider but for a moment Janetta, and you must be convinced how absurd it is to suppose that he could ever make a Bow, or behave like any other Person.”  Having settled this Point to our satisfaction, the next we took into consideration was, to determine in what manner we should inform M'Kenrie of the favourable Opinion Janetta entertained of him.... We at length agreed to acquaint him with it by an anonymous Letter which Sophia drew up in the following manner.	But of HER, I shall have occasion to speak more at large in future.	Adorable Henrietta how beautiful you are!	If I have not now convinced you of her Beauty, Sense and Prudence, I have nothing more to urge in support of my assertion, and you will therefore have no way of deciding the Affair but by coming to Lesley-Castle, and by a personal acquaintance with Louisa, determine for yourself.	"Nay, (said I), I know nothing of that."	"What a beautifull sky!	My Mother rode upon our little poney and Fanny and I walked by her side or rather ran, for my Mother is so fond of riding fast that she galloped all the way.	Besides these two fair Damsels, I found a little humoured Brat here who I beleive is some relation to them, they told me who she was, and gave me a long rigmerole story of her father and a Miss SOMEBODY which I have entirely forgot.	The only difference is that all disputes on the superior excellence of our Employments THEN so frequent are now no more.	I soon perceived that tho' Lovely and Elegant in her Person and tho' Easy and Polite in her Address, she was of that inferior order of Beings with regard to Delicate Feeling, tender Sentiments, and refined Sensibility, of which Augusta was one.	Alas why are not Edward and Augustus here to enjoy its Beauties with us?"	We were in the Inn-yard when his Carriage entered and perceiving by the arms to whom it belonged, and knowing that Lord St Clair was our Grandfather, we agreed to endeavour to get something from him by discovering the Relationship--.	See paragraph 1.C below.	Accordingly I entered and whilst the rest of the party were devouring green tea and buttered toast, we feasted ourselves in a more refined and sentimental Manner by a confidential Conversation.

It is sufficient to say that he was beheaded on the 25th of Feb, after having been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, after having clapped his hand on his sword, and after performing many other services to his Country.	But I will say no more on so melancholy a subject--let me entertain you with something more pleasing--Matilda had a letter this morning from Lesley, by which we have the pleasure of finding that he is at Naples has turned Roman-Catholic, obtained one of the Pope's Bulls for annulling his 1st Marriage and has since actually married a Neapolitan Lady of great Rank and Fortune.	Yes Madam, I had the happiness of adoring you, an happiness for which I cannot be too grateful.	"I arrived on Tuesday."	A soft languor spread over her lovely features, but increased their Beauty--.	Oh!	They were neither of them very rich; their united fortunes had originally amounted to nine thousand Pounds, but as they had always lived on the principal of it, when we were fifteen it was diminished to nine Hundred.	You must not expect scandal for by the same rule we are equally debarred either from hearing or inventing it.--You must expect from me nothing but the melancholy effusions of a broken Heart which is ever reverting to the Happiness it once enjoyed and which ill supports its present wretchedness.	But you must not expect to receive such from me when I get to Town; for it is only at Lesley castle, that one has time to write even to a Charlotte Lutterell.--.	You cannot think your Husband so deficient in personal Charms as you speak of, nor can you surely see any resemblance between him and the Miss Lesleys who are in my opinion perfectly unlike him and perfectly Handsome.” “If that is your opinion with regard to the girls it certainly is no proof of their Fathers beauty, for if they are perfectly unlike him and very handsome at the same time, it is natural to suppose that he is very plain.” “By no means, (said he) for what may be pretty in a Woman, may be very unpleasing in a Man.” “But you yourself (replied I) but a few minutes ago allowed him to be very plain.” “Men are no Judges of Beauty in their own Sex.” (said he).	My Voice faltered, My Eyes assumed a vacant stare, my face became as pale as Death, and my senses were considerably impaired--.	While the VILLIANS of the time would make too long a list to be written or read; I shall therefore content myself with mentioning the leaders of the Gang.	I suppose I shall not see them any more, and yet as a family party we are so stupid, that I do not know what to do with myself.	SCENE CHANGES TO THE SUN-- ENTER Chloe and a chorus of ploughboys.	Well, the sooner the better; and I wish you success."	However, I thought it was proper to give myself a few Airs--so I said to her-- "This is all very pretty Lady Scudamore, but you know that we young Ladies who are Heiresses must not throw ourselves away upon Men who have no fortune at all."	My Dear Brother since you were five years old, I entirely acquit you of ever having willingly contributed to the satisfaction of your Father.	Nothing therfore could be expected from her--she could not be supposed to possess either exalted Ideas, Delicate Feelings or refined Sensibilities--.	my dear Miss Jane (said I) how infinitely am I obliged to you for so entertaining a story!	Imagine my surprise when he was introduced to me by the name of Cleveland--I instantly recognised him as the Brother of Mrs Marlowe, and the acquaintance of my Charlotte at Bristol.	“Certainly, (added my Father) by all means.” “Shall we go now?” (said my Mother,) “The sooner the better.” (answered he.)	I assure you that I am not in the least surprised at your being so warm an advocate for the Beauty of these girls."	They will do very well as foils to myself, so I have invited them to accompany me to London where I hope to be in the course of a fortnight.	It was a most fortunate accident as it diverted the attention of Sophia from the melancholy reflections which she had been before indulging.	We spent a very pleasant Day, and had a very good Dinner, tho' to be sure the Veal was terribly underdone, and the Curry had no seasoning.
