Somewhat later he marries; he does not lose his old love for the poets of the Greek anthology; he has children born to him; he breeds game fowls, and looks after them as closely as a New England farmer’s wife after her poultry; but with him poetry and poultry go together.	“I was married     this day week.	Always, too (if his letters may be trusted), he is eager to make his escape between whiles--wearied of this _tintamarre_--and to rush away to his cottage at Sloperton[52] for a little slippered ease, and a romp with the children.	In the year 1837 he died; and then and there began--within the memory of a good many of us old stagers--that reign of his young niece Victoria, daughter of his brother, the Duke of Kent (who had died seventeen years before)--which reign still continues, and is still resplendent with the virtues of the Sovereign and the well-being of her people.	So, too, those who love real poetry will never cease to admire his subtle turns of thought, and his superb command of all the resources of language.	He had been already enrolled with those Carbonari--the forerunners of the Mazzinis and the Garibaldis--who had labored in vain for the independence and unity of Italy; and in many a burst of his impassioned song he had showered welcoming praises upon a Greece that should be free, and with equal passion attuned his verse to the lament--that     “Freedom found no champion and no child       Such as Columbia saw arise when she     Sprung forth a Pallas, armed and undefiled.” How much all this was real and how much only the romanticism of the poet, was now to be proven.	In estimating our indebtedness to Macaulay as a historian--where his fame and execution were largest--we must remember that his method of close detail forbade wide outlook or grasp of long periods of time.	it seemed very awkward; so it did to his cabinet.	Like Gibbon, he never hunted, never fished, rarely rode.	Welcome to me, and to this silent bed,     Where deep forgetfulness succeeds the roar     Of life, and fretting passions waste the heart no more!’” CHAPTER VII.	But even his victims forgot his severities in his pleasantly magnetic presence and under the caressing suavities of his manner.	We have wandered much in our two last chapters beyond what may be reckoned strictly English lands, into that pleasant region lying between the Tweed and the Firth of Forth; and it was north of the heights of Lammermuir and of the Pentland Hills, and in that delightful old city which is dominated by the lesser heights of the Salisbury crags, the Castle Rock, and Calton Hill, that we found the builders of that great _Review_, which in its livery of buff and blue still carries its original name.	Milk diet might sate that other; but this one, if occasion served, would lap blood.	Wordsworth is conquered by the Art, but has melancholy doubts of the soul that seems caught and hindered in the meshes of its own craftsmanship.	Lady Blessington was always keenly awake for such arrivals.	But the few who did read it thought there were other reasons for its want of success.	;[44] loved too,--in a way--and more than any other creature in the world except himself, that darling daughter of his, the Princess Charlotte, who at seventeen became the bride of Leopold, afterward King of Belgium,--she surviving the marriage only a year.	But now and then--among the thorn-trees reddening into bloom and the rhododendrons bursting their buds, the May mornings were “delicious” to him.	These were Benjamin Disraeli and Edward Lytton Bulwer.	Brougham[29] was always a debater from his boy-days--and not a little of a bully and outlaw; precocious too--a capital Latinist--writing a paper on Optics at eighteen, which found publishment in the Philosophical Transactions; member of the Speculative Society where Jeffrey and Mackintosh, and Alison were wont to go, and where his disputatious spirit ran riot.	_Some Tory Critics._ Among those who sought with a delightsome pertinacity for flaws in the historic work of Macaulay, in his own time, was John Wilson Croker, to whom I have already alluded.	And when thou would’st solace gather,     When our child’s first accents flow,       Wilt thou teach her to say ‘Father’     Though his care she must forego?	The quick dreams,       The passion-winged ministers of thought     Who were his flocks, whom near the living streams       Of his young spirit he fed, and whom he taught       The Love which was its music, wander not--     Wander no more from kindling brain to brain,       But droop there whence they sprung; and mourn their lot     Round the cold heart, where, after their sweet pain,     They ne’er will gather strength, or find a home again.” The weak place in this impassioned commemorative poem lies in its waste of fire upon the heads of those British critics, who--as flimsy, pathetic legends used to run--slew the poet by their savagery.	He receives occasional wandering friends; has a new pet of a dog to fondle.	And this young curate, poor as he is and with a young wife, has an itch for getting into print; and does after a little time (the actual date being 1800) publish a booklet, which you will hardly find now, entitled _Six Sermons preached at Charlotte Chapel, Edinboro, by Rev.	[68] Rossetti, in _Ency.	But they are breezy; they are always pushing forward; spars and sails are all ship-shape; and so are the sailors’ oaths, and the rattle of the chain-cables, and the slatting of the gaskets, and the smell of the stews from the cook’s galley.	_John Keats._ Yet another singer of these days, in most earnest sympathy with the singing moods of Shelley--for whom I can have only a word now, was John Keats;[75] born within the limits of London smoke, and less than three-quarters of a mile from London Bridge--knowing in his boy days only the humblest, work-a-day ranges of life; getting some good Latinity and other schooling out of a Mr. Clarke (of the Cowden Clarke family)--reading Virgil with him, but no Greek.	Of course, such a success broke up the doctoring business, and launched Mackintosh upon a new career.	1828; d. 1858   b.	An eye-witness says:--     “I went prepared to join in a cabal which was formed to put him     down.	We had our rough and ready interviews with that first of “War Correspondents”--Henry Crabb Robinson--who knew all the prominent men of this epoch, and has given us such entertaining chit-chat about them, as we all listen to, and straightway forget.	He lies buried in Clevedon Church, which overhangs the waters of Bristol Channel; and his monument is Tennyson’s wonderful memorial poem.	_The Pleasures of Hope_, 1799; _Gertrude of Wyoming_, 1809; _Life of Petrarch_, 1841; Dr. Beattie’s _Life_, 1850.	He forgot his dignity; he insulted his ministers; he gave to Queen Adelaide, who survived him many years as dowager, many most uncomfortable half-hours; and if he read the new sea-stories of Captain Marryat--though he read very little--I suspect he loved more the spicier condiments of _Peregrine Pickle_ and of _Tom Jones_.	_Francesca da Rimini_, 1816; _Recollections of Byron_, 1828; _The Indicator_, 1819-21; _Autobiography_, 1850.	He was the son of a Dr. Landor, of Warwick, in middle England, who by reason of two adroit marriages was a man of fortune, and so secured eventually a very full purse to the poet, who if he had depended only on the sale of his literary wares, would have starved.	The horses rush along     amidst their glancing harness.	[88] Lang’s _Lockhart_, p. 42, vol.	Dugald Stewart was then active, and did on one or two occasions bring his honored presence to the little chapel to hear the preaching of the young English curate I spoke of.	1801; d. 1860.	His ashes lie in the Protestant burial-ground there--under the shadow of the pyramid of Caius Cestius.	He could not make domiciliary visits, to kiss the babies--whether of patrons, or of editors; he could not listen to twaddle from visiting committees, without breaking into a righteous wrath that hurt his chances.	It is very rare that so poor a book gets so good a name, and wears it so long.	His vanities are not only elastic, but--by his own bland and child-like admissions--they seem sometimes almost monumental.	This novel was suppressed on the eve of publication, and it is said not above five copies of the original edition are extant.” The _Maclise Portrait Gallery_ speaks of an issue in 1872.	For very many years his domestic life,--what little there was of it,--passed without weighty distractions.	iii., Paris edition.	thus disunited,       Torn from every nearer tie,     Seared in heart and lone, and blighted--       More than this, I scarce can die.” I should have felt warranted in giving some intelligible account of the poet’s infelicities at home were it only to lead up to this exhibit of his wondrous literary skill; but I find still stronger reasons in the fact that the hue and cry which followed upon his separation from his wife seemed to exalt the man to an insolent bravado, and a challenge of all restraint--under which his genius flamed up with new power, and with a blighting splendor.	But these all--needed a Macready.	[43] _English Lands and Letters_, vol.	P. 215, _Memoir of John Wilson_.	But ’tis done, all words are idle;       Words from _me_ are vainer still;     But the thoughts we cannot bridle       Force their way, without the will.	Sydney was seeking preaching chances; but was eyed doubtfully by those who had pulpits in their gift.	Reading it, is like a swift, glad stepping along the borders of the brook.	ii.	Of his modern reading he does not tell; yet he was plotting the _History of England_, and the bouncing balladry of the _Lays of Rome_ was even then taking shape in the intervals of his study.	Better lectures in his province may very possibly have been written by others elsewhere--more close, more compact, more thoroughly thought out, more methodic.	The trials of _Peter Simple_ grow largely out of the cruel action of the British laws of primogeniture; nor does the jolly midshipman--grandson, or nephew--forego his satiric raps at my lord “Privilege.” Yet Marryat shows no special admiration for such evolutions of the democratic problem as he encounters in America.	There is also long account in the book to which I have called attention, of a private discourse by George IV., of which Mr. Croker was sole auditor; and it is hard to determine whether Croker is more elated by having the discourse to record, or Mr. Jennings by having such a record to edit.	But he saw on Palatinus       The white porch of his home;     And he spake to the noble river       That rolls by the towers of Rome.	[77] But other and graver disaster was impending.	Colonel Wildman, a distinguished officer in the Peninsular War, who succeeded to the ownership (by purchase) about 1817, expended very large sums upon such judicious improvements as took away its old look of desolation.	[48] From Como Landor went to Pisa--afterward to Florence, his home thenceforth for very many years; first in the town proper and then in a villa at Fiesole from which is seen that wondrous view--none can forget who have beheld it--of the valley, which seems a plain--of the nestling city, with its great Brunelleschi dome, its arrow-straight belfry of Giotto, its quaint tower of the Palazzo Vecchio, its cypress sentinels on the Boboli heights, its River Arno shining and winding, and stealing away seaward from the amphitheatre of hills--on whose slopes are dotted white convents, sleeping in the sun, and villas peeping out from their cloakings of verdure, and the gray shimmer of olive orchards.	On that which the poet navigates,     he rises intrepidly as the waves riot around him, and sits     composedly as they subside.…”     “Level the Alps one with another, and where is their sublimity?	’Twas too late.	This was so far successful as to make the ministerial divorce scheme a failure; but the poor Queen came out of the trial very much bedraggled; whether her Continental life had indeed its criminalities or not, we shall never positively know.	As for the poet Moore, of whom also we may have spoken in terms which may seem of too great disparagement to those who have loved to linger in his                               “Vale of Cashmere       With its roses, the brightest that earth ever gave.	Meantime that wonderful History had been written, and its roll of magniloquent periods made echo in every quarter of the literary world.	The town is small, straggly, bricky,[78] and neither church nor hamlet nor neighbors’ houses are suffused with those softened tints which verdure, and nice keeping, and mellow sunshine give to so many villages of southern England.	CHAPTER VI.	He worried his daughter, Marguerite (Lady Blessington), into marrying, at fifteen, a man whom she detested.	The editorial stand-point may be judged by this averment from the preface,--“the sole English poet bred since Milton to live a master-influence in the world at large.” Another full edition of works, with editing by Earl of Lovelace (grandson of Byron), is announced as shortly to appear from the press of Murray in London, and of Scribners in New York.	Young Hazlitt drifts away from such early influences to Paris and to painting--he thinking to master that art.	These kept his fame alive, but seemed after all only the work of a man playing with literature, rather than of one in earnest.	“Border Minstrelsy,” Scott’s, 60.	His speeches are misplaced treatises; his treatises are epitomes of didactic systems.	_Landor in Italy._ It was in Florence that Landor wrote the greater part of those _Imaginary Conversations_ which have given him his chief fame; but which, very possibly, may be outlived in the popular mind by the wonderful finish and the Saxon force which belong to many of his verselets.	Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,     And saw within the moonlight in his room,     Making it rich and like a lily in bloom,     An Angel, writing in a book of gold.	[57] Edward L. Bulwer (Lord Lytton), b.	This bore a new stamp and had qualities that could not be overlooked.	Or how should she--who has no robes that will stand alone--bring her pretty home gowns into that blazon of the salons?	It was a dark day for him when his mirror showed wrinkles that his cosmetics would not cover, and a stoop in the shoulders which his tailors could not bolster out of sight.
