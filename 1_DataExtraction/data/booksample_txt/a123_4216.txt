Ha!--aren't you just the same?	CLERK.	Any.	Don't say "this young woman," mother dear--it's slightly vulgar.	Yes, I know you believe more in hate than in love.	How she hates the dark gods!	Yes, of course.	ANABEL.	They were county, you know--we never were: father never gave mother a chance, there.	Oh, surely--- MR. BARLOW.	JOB ARTHUR.	Poor old Anabel!	JOB ARTHUR.	GERALD.	Get on with it, then.	JOB ARTHUR.	GERALD.	And what will you do when we leave here?	OLIVER.	I say, why did you come, Anabel?	That's what I say.	GERALD.	Too late now.--I suppose if the men come out, the clerks will come out with them?	And Gerald has done it.	I think so.	ANABEL (after a pause).	(Laughter.)	Only, I don't.	You mean you want to be told?	Good night.	I feel very much more INdifferent.	GERALD.	You seem to smile all over yourself.	MRS. BARLOW.	Well--it's very unfortunate--because we can't give the clerks their increase now, you know.	GERALD.	I only fear they won't.	MR. BARLOW.	GERALD.	GERALD.	WILLIAM.	How long have you been back in England?	No, it doesn't.	I can't think any more.	Keep away from him, if you are going to be a wife to him.	ANABEL.	I don't believe in one strong man appearing out of so many little men.	No, they aren't--not in themselves.	Then why don't you want me to be happy?	We went apart after you had gone.	One panders to the system--one panders to the system.	VOICES.	You see, dear, you can never understand that, although I am weak and wasted, although I may be crossed out from the world like a mistake, I still have peace in my soul, dear, the peach that passeth all understanding.	GERALD.	ANABEL.	ANABEL.	The men will be quiet enough for a bit, if it's all right about the office men, you know.	What principle?	I wanted to see you again.	He will do it.--I suppose you know Oliver?	However, since that year I have had to acknowledge a new situation--a radical if unspoken opposition between masters and men.	GERALD.	MRS. BARLOW (to OLIVER).	Ah, splendid!	JOB ARTHUR.	It's hopeless, you know--it would be far best if they'd all give it up, and try a new line.	Yes, when you went away with that Norwegian--playing your game a little too far.	(Enter BUTLER.)	Then we shall never be happy.	The men of this generation are not like my men.	That's too vague, my boy.	What do you mean to say?--I mean you to say less, do you see?--a great deal less--do you see?	WINIFRED.	The wolf--I love the wolf--he pounces so beautifully.	You are wrong, dear, you are wrong.	Why did you come back, Anabel?	What ballet, Winifred?	OLIVER.	I didn't intend to.	GERALD.	But, Anabel--we must fix a meeting.	But what can they do?	Good!
