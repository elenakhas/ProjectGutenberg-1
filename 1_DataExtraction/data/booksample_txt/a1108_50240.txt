No trophy in my hands I bring,     To this sad, sighing stream,     The neighings and the trumps and cries         Were but a dream--a dream.	THE FOOL’S SONG     Never, no, never, listen too long,     To the chattering wind in the willows, the night bird’s song.	O, be beauty for all my blindness,     A moon in the air where the weary wend,     And dews burdened with loving-kindness             In the dark of the end.	‘Not that she’ll tear out thy innocent eyes,     Poison thy mouth with deviltries.	Dark his eye, wild his face--     Stranger, if in this lonely place     Bide such an one, then, prythee, say     _I_ am come here to-day.’     ‘Many his like, Mistress Fell?’     ‘I did not look, so cannot tell.	“Come in, Come in!”’      THE DARK HOUSE     See this house, how dark it is     Beneath its vast-boughed trees!	Let no night     Seal thy sense in deathly slumber           Till to delight     Thou have paid thy utmost blessing;     Since that all things thou wouldst praise     Beauty took from those who loved them           In other days.	Nay, some are happy whose delight     Is hid even from themselves from sight;     And some win peace who spend     The skill of words to sweeten despair     Of finding consolation where     Life has but one dark end;     Who, in rapt solitude, tell o’er     A tale as lovely as forlore     Into the midnight air.	Oh, when this my dust surrenders     Hand, foot, lip, to dust again,     May these loved and loving faces           Please other men!	May the rusting harvest hedgerow     Still the Traveller’s Joy entwine,     And as happy children gather           Posies once mine.	“Surely,” he sighed, “some load of grief,     Past all our thinking--and belief--     Must weigh upon his back!”     Do, then, in turn, tell me,--If joy     Thy heart as well as voice employ,     Why dost thou now, most Sable, shine     In plumage woefuller far than mine?	ALEXANDER     It was the great Alexander,     Capped with a golden helm,     Sate in the ages, in his floating ship,         In a dead calm.	O vision grave,     Take all the little all I have!	And One, with a lanthorn, draws near,     At clash with the moon in our eyes:     ‘Where art thou?’ he asks: ‘I am here,’     One by one we arise.	‘Thus have they told me.	MRS. GRUNDY     ‘Step very softly, sweet Quiet-foot,     Stumble not, whisper not, smile not:     By this dark ivy stoop cheek and brow.	Naught was in me to tempt your feet     To seek a lodging.	Not one trembling leaflet cries     To that Watcher in the skies--     ‘Remove, remove thy searching gaze,     Innocent, of Heaven’s ways,     Brood not, Moon, so wildly bright,     On secrets hidden from sight.’     ‘Secrets,’ sighs the night-wind,     ‘Vacancy is all I find;     Every keyhole I have made     Wail a summons, faint and sad,     No voice ever answers me,             Only vacancy.’     ‘Once, once ...’ the cricket shrills,     And far and near the quiet fills     With its tiny voice, and then             Hush falls again.	Still even thy heart!	I am that Adam who, with broken wings,     Fled from the Seraph’s brazen trumpetings.	Strip me of what in voiceless thought     Life’s kept of life, unhoped, unsought!--     Reverie and dream that memory must             Hide deep in dust!	Not tears I give; but all that he     Clasped in his arms sweet charity;     All that he loved--to him I bring     For a close whispering.’      THE STRANGER     In the woods as I did walk,     Dappled with the moon’s beam,     I did with a Stranger talk,     And his name was Dream.	Ah, then, sweet face burn on,     While yet quick memory lives!	Hush!...	Yet Pity whispered, ‘Why?’     Thou silly thing, off to thy daisies go.	For the thing unsaid that heart asked of me     Be a dark, cool water calling--calling     To the footsore, benighted, solitary,             When the shadows are falling.	I use words     I hardly know the meaning of;     And the mute birds     Are glancing at Love     From out their shade of leaf and flower,     Trembling at treacheries     Which even in noonday cower.	How black it is     Beneath these thick-boughed trees!	Not simple happy mad like me,     Who am mad like an empty scene     Of water and willow tree,     Where the wind hath been;     But that foul Satan-mad,     Who rots in his own head,     And counts the dead,     Not honest one--and two--     But for the ghosts they were,     Brave, faithful, true,     When head in air,     In Earth’s clear green and blue     Heaven they did share     With Beauty who bade them there....	‘The flower and the thorn are here;     Falleth the night-dew, cold and clear;     Out of her bower the bird replies,     Mocking the dark with ecstasies:     See how the earth’s green grass doth grow,     Praising what sleeps below!	Cold are their stones, beloved,     To hand and side.	Thou with thy cheek on mine,     And dark hair loosed, shalt see     Take the far stars for fruit     The cypress tree,     And in the yew’s black     Shall the moon be.	Stand watch--O days no number keep     Of hours when this dark clay is blind.	Time, heedless of the past,     No loving-kindness knows;     Chill unto mortal lip     Still Lethe flows.	And lest some hideous listener tells,     I’ll ring my bells.	What seest thou?’     ‘High coifed, broad-browed, aged, suave yet grim,     A large flat face, eyes keenly dim,     Staring at nothing--that’s me!--and yet,     With a hate one could never, no, never forget....’     ‘This is my world, my garden, my home,     Hither my father bade mother to come     And bear me out of the dark into light,     And happy I was in her tender sight.	EYES     O strange devices that alone divide     The seër from the seen--     The very highway of earth’s pomp and pride     That lies between     The traveller and the cheating, sweet delight     Of where he longs to be,     But which, bound hand and foot, he, close on night,     Can only see.	THE TRYST     Why in my heart, o grief,     Dost thou in beauty bide?	THE DREAMER     O thou who giving helm and sword,     Gav’st, too, the rusting rain,     And starry dark’s all tender dews         To blunt and stain:     Out of the battle I am sped,     Unharmed, yet stricken sore;     A living shape ’mid whispering shades         On Lethe’s shore.	Thy silence is a sadder thing     Than any dirge I sing!’     Thus then these two small birds, perched there,     Breathed a strange riddle both did share     Yet neither could expound.	I know a Blind Man, too,     Who with a sharp ear listens and listens the whole world through.	And none lifts a hand to withhold     A friend from the touch of that foe:     Heart cries unto heart, ‘Thou art old!’     Yet reluctant, we go.	There, now!	’Tis sad in sooth to lie under the grass,     But none too gladsome to wake and grow cold where life’s shadows pass.	Look thy last on all things lovely,     Every hour.	Oh, sit we snug to our feast,     With platter and finger and spoon--and good victuals at least.	Ay, and the light doth dim,     And asleep ’s the rose,     And tired Innocence     In dreams is hence....     Come, Love, my lad,     Nodding that drowsy head,     ’Tis time thy prayers were said!	FAREWELL     When I lie where shades of darkness     Shall no more assail mine eyes,     Nor the rain make lamentation           When the wind sighs;     How will fare the world whose wonder     Was the very proof of me?	Ay, music hath small sense,     And a tune’s soon told,     And Earth is old,     And my poor wits are dense;     Yet have I secrets,--dark, my dear,     To breathe you all: Come near.	‘Oh yes, thou most blessed, from Monday to Sunday     Has lived on me, preyed on me, Mrs. Grundy:     Called me, “dear Nephew”; on each of those chairs     Has gloated in righteousness, heard my prayers.	Nay, but a dream I had     Of a world all mad.	CLEAR EYES     Clear eyes do dim at last,     And cheeks outlive their rose.	Dead is my well-content,     And buried deep my pride.	All the high pomp of Asia,     Charmed by that siren lay,     Out of their weary and dreaming minds,         Faded away.	Oh, from wide circuit, shall at length I see     Pure daybreak lighten again on Eden’s tree?	MISTRESS FELL     ‘Whom seek you here, sweet Mistress Fell?’     ‘One who loved me passing well.	Traitor to life, of life betrayed--     O, of thy mercy deep,     A dream my all, the all I ask         Is sleep.	When the world’s clocks are dumb in sleep     ’Tis then I seek my kind.	Wonderly strange was earth to see,     Flowers white as milk did gleam;     Spread to Heaven the Assyrian Tree     Over my head with Dream.	No more with wordless grief a loved one grieve,     But to heaven’s nothingness re-welcome Eve?	Voices of sea-maids singing     Wandered across the deep:     The sailors labouring on their oars         Rowed, as in sleep.	MOTLEY     Come, Death, I’d have a word with thee;     And thou, poor Innocency;     And Love--a lad with broken wing;     And Pity, too:     The Fool shall sing to you,     As Fools will sing.	Softly his breast-brooch burned and shone;     Hill and deep were in his eyes;     One of his hands held mine, and one     The fruit that makes men wise.	Memory fades, must the remembered           Perishing be?	FOR ALL THE GRIEF     For all the grief I have given with words     May now a few clear flowers blow,     In the dust, and the heat, and the silence of birds,             Where the lonely go.	O, thy veiled, lovely face--     Joy’s strange disguise--     Shall be the last to fade     From these rapt eyes,     Ere the first dart of daybreak     Pierce the skies.	Vast broods the silence of night,     The ruinous moon     Lifts on our faces her light,     Whence all dreaming is gone.	Heed, heed not what I said     Of frenzied hosts of men,     More fools than I,     On envy, hatred fed,     Who kill, and die--     Spake I not plainly, then?	This only I say,--Though cold and bare     The haunted house you have chosen to share,     Still ’neath its walls the moonbeam goes     And trembles on the untended rose;     Still o’er its broken roof-tree rise     The starry arches of the skies;     And ’neath your lightest word shall be     The thunder of an ebbing sea.	Stealthily lave those waters     That solemn shore.	THE EXILE     I am that Adam who, with Snake for guest,     Hid anguished eyes upon Eve’s piteous breast.	Only this I surely know,     When his voice called me, I must go;     Touched me his fingers, and my heart     Leapt at the sweet pain’s smart.’     ‘Why did he leave you, Mistress Fell?’     ‘Magic laid its dreary spell.--     Stranger, he was fast asleep;     Into his dream I tried to creep;     Called his name, soft was my cry:     He answered--not one sigh.	And I come,     As flies the wounded wild-bird home.	Time like a falling dew,     Life like the scene of a dream     Laid between slumber and slumber,         Only did seem....     O Alexander, then,     In all us mortals too,     Wax thou not bold--too bold         On the wave dark-blue!	Else, had not death so lured you on,     You would have grieved--’twixt joy and fear--     To know how my small loving son     Had wept for you, my dear.	And we--who sing but as we can,     In the small knowledge of a man--     Have we an answer found?	Griefs, too, but brief while stay,     And sorrow, being o’er,     Its salt tears shed away,     Woundeth the heart no more.	He hath supped where creep     Eyeless worms in hush of sleep;     Yet, when he smiles, the hand he draws     Athwart his grinning jaws--     Faintly the thin bones rattle, and--There, there;     Hearken how my bells in the air     Drive away care!...	THE OLD MEN     Old and alone, sit we,     Caged, riddle-rid men;     Lost to earth’s ‘Listen!’ and ‘See!’     Thought’s ‘Wherefore?’ and ‘When?’     Only far memories stray     Of a past once lovely, but now     Wasted and faded away,     Like green leaves from the bough.	We will tell no old tales,     Nor heed if in wandering air     Die a lost song of love     Or the once fair;     Still as well-water be     The thoughts we share!	THE FLIGHT     How do the days press on, and lay     Their fallen locks at evening down,     Whileas the stars in darkness play     And moonbeams weave a crown--     A crown of flower-like light in heaven,     Where in the hollow arch of space     Morn’s mistress dreams, and the Pleiads seven     Stand watch about her place.	Come the calm, infinite night,     Who then will hear     Aught save the singing         Of the sea-maids clear?	And, while the ghosts keep     Tryst from chill sepulchres,     Dreamless our gaze shall sleep,     And sealed our ears;     Heart unto heart will speak,     Without tears.
