I hope she was _prospecting_ with a view to settlement in our garden.	In building the nest, a long piece of packthread had been somewhat loosely woven in.	There was no growth of any kind to conceal them, and yet these ordinarily shy birds were almost as indifferent to my passing as common poultry would have been.	A pair of pewees have built immemorially on a jutting brick in the arched entrance to the ice-house; always on the same brick, and never more than a single pair, though two broods of five each are raised there every summer.	(1) The home of the Nortons, in Cambridge, who were at the time of this paper in Europe.	Some birds have left us, I suppose, because the country is growing less wild.	scarce higher than the tops of the chimneys.	_The Titmouse,_ lines 75, 76.	He never has these fine intervals of lunacy into which his cousins, the catbird and the mavis, are apt to fall.	Can such an open bosom cover such depravity?	I thought it not impossible that a few simple stories of my winged acquaintances might be found entertaining by persons of kindred taste.	Yet such men are doubtless sent into the world for this special end, and perhaps there is no kind of accurate observation, whatever its object, that has not its final use and value for some one or other.	They grew so wonted as to throw off a great part of their shyness, and to tolerate my near approach.	empty of its so long-loved household) they build by hundreds, and nothing can be more cheery than their creaking clatter (like a convention of old-fashioned tavern-signs) as they gather at evening to debate in mass meeting their windy politics, or to gossip at their tent-doors over the events of the day.	But his opera-season is a short one.	I have no doubt that in his old age he accounted for his lameness by some handsome story of a wound received at the famous Battle of the Pines, when our tribe, overcome by numbers, was driven from its ancient camping-ground.	Not Wellington's veterans made cleaner work of a Spanish town; not Federals or Confederates were ever more impartial in the confiscation of neutral chickens.	(1) Shakespeare: _King Henry V.,_ act i, scene 2.	I remember when the whippoorwill could be heard in Sweet Auburn.	What may be called local migrations are doubtless dictated by the chances of food.	There is a common notion that animals are better meteorologists than men, and I have little doubt that in immediate weather-wisdom they have the advantage of our sophisticated senses (though I suspect a sailor or shepherd would be their match), but I have seen nothing that leads me to believe their minds capable of erecting the horoscope of a whole season, and letting us know beforehand whether the winter will be severe or the summer rainless.	This spring, as I was cleansing a pear-tree of its lichens, one of these little zigzagging blurs came purring toward me, couching his long bill like a lance, his throat sparkling with angry fire, to warn me off from a Missouri-currant whose honey he was sipping.	Certain birds have disappeared from our neighborhood within my memory.	(1) Of savage birds, a hen-hawk now and then quarters himself upon us for a few days, sitting sluggish in a tree after a surfeit of poultry.	For a few years I had crows, but their nests are an irresistible bait for boys, and their settlement was broken up.	Men learn to value thermometers of the true imaginative temperament, capable of prodigious elations and corresponding dejections.	Nor do I doubt that he had a true country-gentleman's interest in the weather-cock; that his first question on coming down of a morning was, like Barabas's,    "Into what quarter peers my halcyon's bill?"	On the whole, he is a doubtful friend in the garden.	I happened to meet a neighbor; as we mopped our brows at each other, he told me that he had just cleared 100o, and I went home a beaten man.	This very year I saw the linnets at work thatching, just before a snow-storm which covered the ground several inches deep for a number of days.	But one who, like me, has always lived in the country and always on the same spot, is drawn to his book by other occult sympathies.	Almost every season a solitary quail visits us, and, unseen among the currant bushes, alls _Bob White, Bob White,_ as if he were playing at hide-and-seek with that imaginary being.	When I took out my knife to cut their hempen bonds, the heads of the family seemed to divine my friendly intent.	It is even to be hoped that the speculations of our newspaper editors and their myriad correspondence upon the signs of the political atmosphere may also fill their appointed place in a well-regulated universe, if it be only that of supplying so many more jack-o'-lanterns to the future historian.	Perhaps, like other unlettered folk, they came to the conclusion that the Devil was in it, and yielded to the invisible persecution of witchcraft.	Never before this summer (1870) have the king-birds, handsomest of flycatchers, built in my orchard; though I always know where to find them within half a mile.	_They_ do not use their poor wits in regulating God's clocks, nor think they cannot go astray so long as they carry their guide-board about with them,--a delusion we often practise upon ourselves with our high and mighty reason, that admirable finger-post which points every way and always right.	And yet the mere taming of the neighborhood does not quite satisfy me as an explanation.	With shame I confess it, I have been bullied even by a hummingbird.	I have never been quite able to fathom the local, or rather geographical partialities of birds.	They must have sent out spies, as did the Jews into the promised land, before I was stirring.	They are very bold, by the way, in quest of cordage, and I have often watched them stripping the fibrous bark from a honeysuckle growing over the very door.	I had not felt the heat before, save as a beautiful exaggeration of sunshine; but now it oppressed me with the prosaic vulgarity of an oven.	Ever since I can remember, a pair of them have built in a gigantic syringa near our front door, and I have known the male to sing almost uninterruptedly during the evenings of early summer till twilight duskened into dark.	But some old friends are constant.	They had fairly sacked the vine.	The crow is very comical as a lover, and to hear him trying to soften his croak to the proper Saint Preux(1) standard has something the effect of a Mississippi boatman quoting Tennyson.	Their port is grave, and their stalk across the turf as martial as that of a second-rate ghost in Hamlet.	The brown thrush has moved farther up country.	The bobolinks are generally chance visitors, tinkling through the garden in blossoming-time, but this year, owing to the long rains early in the season, their favorite meadows were flooded, and they were driven to the upland.	The barn-swallows, which once swarmed in our barn, flashing through the dusty sun-streak of the mow, have been gone these many years.	This, owing to the fluttering terror of the prisoners, was an affair of some delicacy; but ere long I was rewarded by seeing one of them fly away to a neighboring tree, while the cripple, making a parachute of his wings, came lightly to the ground, and hopped off as well as he could with one leg, obsequiously waited on by his elders.	they perched quietly within reach of my hand, and watched me in my work of manumission.	One can hardly help fancying that he sings in his dreams.	is a rational question that bears not remotely on the making of hay and the prosperity of crops.	It had but just been discovered that a surface inclined at a certain angle with the plane of the horizon took more of the sun's rays.	The fact remained that his herald Mercury, standing a tiptoe, could look down on mine.	There was a native grape-vine close by, blue with its less refined abundance, but my cunning thieves preferred the foreign flavor.	But, in spite of his name of migratory thrush, he stays with us all winter, and I have seen him when the thermometer marked 15 degrees below zero of Fahrenheit, armed impregnably within,(1) like Emerson's Titmouse, and as cheerful as he.	The rose-breasted grosbeak has been a familiar bird in Brookline (three miles away), yet I never saw one here till last July, when I found a female busy among my raspberries and surprisingly bold.	Twice have the crow-blackbirds attempted a settlement in my pines, and twice have the robins, who claim a right of preemption, so successfully played the part of border-ruffians as to drive them away,--to my great regret, for they are the best substitute we have for rooks.	More than thirty years ago, a cherry-tree, then in full bloom, near my window, was covered with humming-birds benumbed by a fall of mingled rain and snow, which probably killed many of them.	In that case, the imitation was by no means so close as to deceive, but a free reproduction of the notes of some other birds, especially of the oriole, as a kind of variation in his own song.	whose sole knowledge of the subject has been derived from a life-long success in getting a living out of the public without paying any equivalent therefor, will perhaps be of interest hereafter to some explorer of our _cloaca maxima,_ whenever it is cleansed.	J.R.L.	The bank-swallows, wellnigh innumerable during my boyhood, no longer frequent the crumbly cliff of the gravel-pit by the river.	He, too, has shared in these mercurial triumphs and defeats.	I have known him to station his young in a thick cornel-bush on the edge of the raspberry-bed, after the fruit began to ripen, and feed them there for a week or more.	I do not believe, however, that he robbed any nests hereabouts, for the refuse of the gas-works, which, in our free-and-easy community, is allowed to poison the river, supplied him with dead alewives in abundance.	The tortoise had always known this (though he unostentatiously made no parade of it), and used accordingly to tilt himself up against the garden-wall in the autumn.	It should seem that their coming was dated by the height of the sun, which betrays them into unthrifty matrimony;    "So priketh hem Nature in hir corages;"(1) but their going is another matter.	These songsters love the neighborhood of man because hawks and owls are rarer, while their own food is more abundant.	But it was Sunday, and I gave him the benefit of its gracious truce of God.	Of late years the jays have visited us only at intervals; and in winter their bright plumage, set off by the snow, and their cheerful cry, are especially welcome.	One of them once offered me a near shot from my study-window one drizzly day for several hours.	My father would lead me out to see them gather on the roof, and take counsel before their yearly migration, as Mr. White used to see them at Selborne.	I might suspect his thermometer (as indeed I did, for we Harvard men are apt to think ill of any graduation but our own); but it was a poor consolation.	They did not fall-to and deliberately destroy it, for they might have been caught at their mischief.	One very hot day I stood for some time within twenty feet of a mother and three children, who sat on an elm bough over my head gasping in the sultry air, and holding their wings half-spread for coolness.	On second thought, I remember to have heard the cuckoo strike the hours nearly all night with the regularity of a Swiss clock.	He feels and freely exercises his right of eminent domain.	After all, his claim is only for tithes, while the robin will bag your entire crop if he get a chance.	He is a shy bird, but a few days ago I had the satisfaction of studying him through the blinds as he sat on a tree within a few feet of me.
