The whole day passes thus: you excuse yourself from all companionship: you have not the heart to tell the story of your troubles to Dalton,--least of all, to Miss Dalton.	No walls of brick and mortar cramp one; no factitious distinctions mould your habit.	You are at the cottage-door.-- "Good night, Maggie;"--very feelingly.	In the town, small as it may be, and darkened as it may be with the shadows of trees, you cannot forget--men.	There are the Births,--your father's, and your mother's; it seems as if they were born a long time ago; and even your own date of birth appears an almost incredible distance back.	Does the soul wither at that Rubicon which lies between the Gallic country of youth and the Rome of manliness?	But you have a classmate--I will call him Dalton--who is very intimate with a dashing Senior; they room near each other outside the college.	She does not seek to provoke any special attention.	----Aye, my boy, kiss your mother,--kiss her again; fondle your sweet Nelly; pass your little hand through the gray locks of your father; love them dearly while you can!	Dr. Bidlow is no more!	I love better to count time from spring to spring; it seems to me far more cheerful to reckon the year by blossoms than by blight.	And he rouses himself,--passes his arm around her,--looks in her face fondly,--draws her to him, and prints a kiss upon her forehead.	With somewhat of this strange vanity growing on you, you do not suffer the heart to wake into life except in such fanciful dreams as tempt you back to the sunny slopes of childhood.	The doors are opened and shut softly, and they all step noiselessly about your chamber; and when you groan with pain, you are sure of meeting sad, sympathizing looks.	You are silent on your return.	instructs him in some little phrase of endearment that she knows will touch your heart; and then she watches your coming; and the little fellow runs toward you, and warbles out his lesson of love in tones that forbid you any answer,--save only those brimming eyes, turned first on her, and then on him,--and poorly concealed by the quick embrace, and the kisses which you shower in transport!	You sit still, with your hand in Nelly's, and look thoughtfully into the blaze.	And she, who made that home so dear to your boyhood, so real to your after-years,--standing amid all the flights of your youthful ambition, and your paltry cares (for they seem paltry now), and your doubts, and anxieties and weaknesses of heart, like the light of your hope--burning ever there under the shadow of the sycamores,--a holy beacon, by whose guidance you always came to a sweet haven, and to a refuge from all your toils,--is gone, gone forever!	----So it is, that, as you lie there upon the sunny greensward, at the old Squire's door, you muse upon the time when some rich-lying land, with huge granaries, and cosy old mansion sleeping under the trees, shall be yours,--when the brooks shall water your meadows, and come laughing down your pasture-lands,--when the clouds shall shed their spring fragrance upon your lawns, and the daisies bless your paths.	In one or two individual instances, it is true, it has been broken down by an unfortunate squabble with thick-set fellows in the Chapel aisle.	The monster elms, which have bowered your proud steps through four years of proudest life, lift up to the night their rounded canopy of leaves with a quiet majesty that mocks you.	"I am calm," says your mother; but you do not think it, for you see her tremble very plainly.	She is good; her hopes live where the angels live.	It makes you wish it were yours.	Autumn brings to the home the cheerful glow of "first fires."	Is there not a ringing desire in many minds to seize hold of what floats above us in the universe of thought, and drag down what shreds we can to scatter to the world?	If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.	"And did she leave no message for me, Nelly?"	Beside all which he has an immense deal of information.	The world is stronger than the night; and the bindings of sense are tenfold stronger than the most exquisite delirium of soul.	I pile my fire with the clean-cleft hickory; and musing over some sweet story of the olden time, I wander into a rich realm of thought, until my eyes grow dim, and dreaming of battle and of prince, I fall to sleep in my old farm-chamber.	They cross a little valley with slow, faltering steps.	"I am sure Nelly loves you very much."	Your note-book shows long lines of figures.	I shall lay no claim to the title of moralist, teacher, or romancist: my thoughts start pleasant pictures to my mind; and in a garrulous humor I put my finger in the button-hole of my indulgent friend, and tell him some of them,--giving him leave to quit me whenever he chooses.	You consult some gray old veteran in the war of gold, scarred with wounds, and crowned with honors, and watch eagerly for the words and the ways which have won him wealth.	The high-road passes a stone's-throw away; but there is little "travel" to be seen; and every chance passer will inevitably come under the range of the kitchen windows, and be studied carefully by the eyes of the stout dairy-maid,--to say nothing of the stalwart Indian cook.	As for Jenny,--your first, fond flame!--lively, romantic, black-eyed Jenny,--the reader of "Thaddeus of Warsaw,"--who sighed and wore blue ribbons on her bonnet,--who wrote love-notes,--who talked so tenderly of broken hearts,--who used a glass seal with a Cupid and a dart,--dear Jenny!--she is now the plump and thriving wife of the apothecary of the town!	You have quoted poetry to Miss Dalton; you have clasped Miss Dalton's hand!	Another Madge is sister to Frank; and a little Nelly is younger sister to this other Madge.	The full-risen moon, that dapples the ground beneath the trees, touches the tall church-spires with silver, and slants their loftiness--as memory slants grief--in long, dark, tapering lines upon the silvered Green.	And she pushes her ventures with a bold hand; she makes timidity strong, and weakness valiant.	"Yes, Clarence,--to meet her one day!"	Say it to yourself when the night is far over, and you wake with some sudden start from pleasant dreams,--"gone."	It is not a little odd, that, when we have least strength to combat the world, we have the highest confidence in our ability.	Madge _is_ true.	He studies moral sparring.	_INTRODUCTORY._                                                  page I.	Her words have a gentle earnestness and honesty that could never nurture guile.	You are again at the home of Nelly; she is very joyous; she is the confidante of Madge.	I thank Heaven every summer's day of my life, that my lot was humbly cast within the hearing of romping brooks, and beneath the shadow of oaks.	The letters of your mother, as I said, make you sigh: there is no moment in our lives when we feel less worthy of the love of others, and less worthy of our own respect, than when we receive evidences of kindness which we know we do not merit,--and when souls are laid bare to us, and we have too much indifference to lay bare our own in return.	The very atmosphere of these courts, wakened with high metaphysic discourse, seems to lend them a Greek beauty and fineness; and you attach to the prettiest, that your eye can reach, all the charms of some Sciote maiden, and all the learning of her father--the professor.	You think how good a life you will lead; and you map out great purposes, spreading themselves over the school-weeks of your remaining boyhood; and you love your friends, or seem to, far more dearly than you ever loved them before; and you forgive the boy who provoked you to that sad fall from the oak, and you forgive him all his wearisome teasings.	----Yet even now there is a lurking goodness in you that traces its beginning to the old garret-home,--there is an air in the harvest heats that whispers of the bloom of spring.	You draw out Nelly to speak of Madge: Nelly is very prudent.	He will never be subjugated on his own ground of action and energy; but let him be lured to that border country over which the delicacy and fondness of a womanly nature presides, and his energy yields, his haughty determination faints, he is proud of submission!	1.F.	_SUMMER;_ OR, _THE DREAMS OF YOUTH._ _DREAMS OF YOUTH._ _Summer._ I feel a great deal of pity for those honest but misguided people who call their little, spruce suburban towns, or the shaded streets of their inland cities,--the country and I have still more pity for those who reckon a season at the summer resorts--country enjoyment.	The first keen grief of youth seeks little of the sympathy of companions: it lies--with a sensitive man--bounded within the narrowest circles of the heart.	over the edge of the bed.	They only who hold the key to its innermost recesses can speak consolation.	There it is, Maggie, under the willow,--my poor mother's grave!"	A little maturity of heart is wanted to make up what the poets call sensibility.	Ay, close your doors; shut out the world; draw close your curtains; fold them to your heart,--your crushed, bleeding, desolate heart!	That Providence, whose eye and hand are the spy and the executioner of the Fateful changes of our life, may bring you back in Manhood, or in Age, to this mountain home of New England; and that very willow yonder, which your fancy now makes the graceful mourner of your leave, may one day shadow mournfully your grave!	The demands of this new, Western life of ours are practical and earnest.	The birds sing sweetly; you catch yourself watching to see what new songsters they can be: they are only the old robins and thrushes, yet what a new melody is in their throats!	He bewilders you, too, with his talk about the great bridges of London,--London Bridge specially, where they sell kids for a penny; which story your new acquaintance unfortunately does not confirm.	Is their vitality necessarily young?	He has grown spare, and wears spectacles.	Now they grow into the affections like new-found friends, and gain a hold upon the heart, and light a fire in the brain, that the years and the mould cannot cover nor quench.	It supposes no extensions or increase; it is integral, fixed, perfect,--the whole.	The trees are greenest in that direction; the shadows are softest; the flowers are thickest.	"Maggie," you say, "Mr. Thornton has been very kind to me."	The creaking of the timbers, and the lashing of the waves, are quieting music compared with the storm of your raging fears.	You meantime profess to be very much engrossed with your grammar--turned upside-down; you think it must have hurt, and are only sorry that it did not happen to a tall, dark-faced boy, who cheated you in a swop of jackknives.	"It's very awkward," said he to me one day; "I have had large occasion for practice to be sure; but I rather fancy, after all, our own language; it's heartier and easier."	Or perhaps she is under the fierce eye of some Cerberus of a schoolmistress, about whose grounds you prowl piteously, searching for small knot-holes in the surrounding board fence, through which little _souvenirs_ of impassioned feeling may be thrust.	"And she says"-- "That I must speak with you, sir."	They grapple you indeed oftener than you dare to speak of.

It was a fancy of hers to give special, social patronage to foreign artists; and among those just then at Saratoga, and the recipients of her favor, were a distinguished violinist--whose name I do not now recall--and the newly married Mme.
