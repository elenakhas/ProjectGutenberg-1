Then there came down from Langdale Pike  A cloud, with lightning, wind and hail;  It swept over the mountains like  An ocean,--and I heard it strike  The woods and crags of Grasmere vale.	And yet a strange and horrid curse  Clung upon Peter, night and day;  Month after month the thing grew worse,                         700  And deadlier than in this my verse  I can find strength to say.

And this is Hell--and in this smother  All are damnable and damned;  Each one damning, damns the other;  They are damned by one another,                                 220  By none other are they damned.	'Or,' cried he, a grave look collecting,  'Is it my genius, like the moon,  Sets those who stand her face inspecting,                       505  That face within their brain reflecting,  Like a crazed bell-chime, out of tune?'

But from the first 'twas Peter's drift  To be a kind of moral eunuch,  He touched the hem of Nature's shift,                           315  Felt faint--and never dared uplift  The closest, all-concealing tunic.	Yet the Reviews, who heaped abuse  On Peter while he wrote for freedom,                            620  So soon as in his song they spy  The folly which soothes tyranny,  Praise him, for those who feed 'em.	And these obscure remembrances  Stirred such harmony in Peter,  That, whensoever he should please,                              420  He could speak of rocks and trees  In poetic metre.	50  11.

The Devil then sent to Leipsic fair  For Born's translation of Kant's book;  A world of words, tail foremost, where                          520  Right--wrong--false--true--and foul--and fair  As in a lottery-wheel are shook.

''Tis you are cold--for I, not coy,  Yield love for love, frank, warm, and true;  And Burns, a Scottish peasant boy--                             325  His errors prove it--knew my joy  More, learned friend, than you.	She laughed the while, with an arch smile,  And kissed him with a sister's kiss,  And said--My best Diogenes,                                     320  I love you well--but, if you please,  Tempt not again my deepest bliss.	He is--what we are; for sometimes  The Devil is a gentleman;  At others a bard bartering rhymes  For sack; a statesman spinning crimes;  A swindler, living as he can;                                   85  3.	'It happens fortunately, dear Sir,  I can.	20.	Then seriatim, month and quarter,  Appeared such mad tirades.--One said--  'Peter seduced Mrs. Foy's daughter,                             470  Then drowned the mother in Ullswater,  The last thing as he went to bed.'	490  For carriage, tenpence Peter paid--  Untied them--read them--went half mad.	17.	4.	1.E.8.	8.	The Devil WAS in it:--he had bought  Peter for half-a-crown; and when  The storm which bore him vanished, nought  That in the house that storm had caught  Was ever seen again.	And all the rest rushed through the door  And tumbled over one another,  And broke their skulls.--Upon the floor  Meanwhile sat Peter Bell, and swore,  And cursed his father and his mother;                           40  9.	21.	And all this, though quite ideal,--  Ready at a breath to vanish,--  Was a state not more unreal  Than the peace he could not feel,                               135  Or the care he could not banish.	Like gentle rains, on the dry plains,  Making that green which late was gray,  Or like the sudden moon, that stains                            440  Some gloomy chamber's window-panes  With a broad light like day.	PART 6.	For he now raved enormous folly,  Of Baptisms, Sunday-schools, and Graves,                        615  'Twould make George Colman melancholy  To have heard him, like a male Molly,  Chanting those stupid staves.	32.	7.	60  13.	11.

So good and bad, sane and mad,  The oppressor and the oppressed;  Those who weep to see what others  Smile to inflict upon their brothers;                           255  Lovers, haters, worst and best;  23.	I have found the way                                   630  To make a better thing of metre  Than e'er was made by living creature  Up to this blessed day.'	'O that mine enemy had written  A book!'

The Devil now knew his proper cue.--  Soon as he read the ode, he drove  To his friend Lord MacMurderchouse's,                           655  A man of interest in both houses,  And said:--'For money or for love,  2.

Thus--though unimaginative--  An apprehension clear, intense,  Of his mind's work, had made alive                              310  The things it wrought on; I believe  Wakening a sort of thought in sense.	And Peter bowed, quite pleased and proud,  And after waiting some few days  For a new livery--dirty yellow  Turned up with black--the wretched fellow                       145  Was bowled to Hell in the Devil's chaise.	At night he oft would start and wake  Like a lover, and began  In a wild measure songs to make                                 405  On moor, and glen, and rocky lake,  And on the heart of man--  8.	3.	1.	12.	480  Thief!
