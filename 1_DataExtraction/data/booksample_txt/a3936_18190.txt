said Raggedy Ann as she put her arms about Jeanette.	And, it was Marcella herself who found her.	He is sure to come home soon!'	[Illustration] They did not take time to climb from the shelves, but all rolled or jumped off to the floor and scrambled back to their room as fast as they could run, leaving a trail of bread crumbs and jam along the way.	All the dolls lay as still as mice for a few minutes, then Raggedy Ann raised up on her cotton-stuffed elbows and said: "I have been thinking!"	Raggedy Ann turned her rag head to see the humming-bird and lost her balance--_plump!_ she went, down amongst the chickens.	But such a comical looking Raggedy Ann!	So they followed the brook until they found her.	It was Boots.	"Would you let me take Raggedy Ann for a few days?"	"Then let us waste no more time in talking!"	"I remember now that I threw dear old Raggedy Ann from me as I ran out the door and she must have fallen in the clothes hamper!	Fido continued.	Have you had a nice time?"	I will never let you leave me again."	Then she hung them all out on the clothes-line in the sunshine to dry.	Then she saw Raggedy Ann's face and picked her up.	They swarmed upon the pantry shelves and in their eagerness spilled a pitcher of cream which ran all over the French dolly's dress.	some of the boys said when they saw Marcella's troubled face, and they started running in the direction Raggedy Ann had fallen.	said they.	Raggedy cried, as she stooped and picked up one of the little puff-balls.	"Oh yes," replied Raggedy Ann, "I was so happy I forgot to tell you.	"I was so interested in looking out of the window I did not pay any attention to what they said, for we were on a train and the scenery was just flying by!	said the dollies each night.	"Come in," Peterkins said when he saw and recognized the dolls, so all the dollies went into Peterkins' house and sat about while Raggedy told him why they had come.	"We just left the nests when you fell into the pen!"	"And at the end of the three weeks do the eggs sprout?"	In the center of the bridge, Fido caught up with the new puppy dog and they had a lively tug-of-war with Raggedy Ann stretched between then.	You see, we never leave the nests only just once in a while to get a drink and to eat a little.	Suddenly the rag parted and Raggedy Ann went sailing away as the wind caught in her skirts.	Cheery!"	"Tell us how to start about it."	Raggedy Ann knew just how it all happened and her remaining shoe-button eye twinkled.	"See the nice yarn!	"Then show us the way!"	And _you_ would have been angry, too, for something had happened to Jeanette.	Something or someone had stolen into the nursery that night when the dolls were asleep and nibbled all the wax from Jeanette's beautiful face--and now all her beauty was gone!	said the older painter, "and now you are in for it!"	I haven't had any bones since the folks had beef last Sunday.	"Yes!"	said Raggedy Ann.	"I do believe she scrubbed my face so hard she wore off my smile!"	"Very much ashamed of myself!"	The nursery window was open, so the dolls helped each other up on the sill and then jumped to the soft grass below.	He walked over to the table and sniffed, in hopes Marcella had given the dolls real food and that some would still be left.	Raggedy Ann did not sleep a wink, for she shared her bed with Fido and he kept her awake whispering to her.	Both new dolls were silent for a while, thinking deeply.	She called to Daddy Robin and told him to come.	Raggedy Ann said.	Now it happened Raggedy lit in the clothes hamper and there she lay all doubled up in a knot.	Then she went over and gave Raggedy Ann a good night hug.	"At the last place I lived the people found out about my kittens and do you know, all the kittens disappeared!	They are coming this way!"	asked the tin soldier and Uncle Clem, in one voice.	When the catch was raised, the dogs were so anxious to get out they pushed and jumped against the gate so hard it flew open, knocking Peterkins and Raggedy Ann into the mud.	"I was visiting the mice inside the walls and wandered out here to pick up cake crumbs!	replied Raggedy Ann, "It made me very happy.	Cheery!	Raggedy Ann and Fido again ran to the window and saw the Fairy troop dancing among the flowers.	"I feel that something is about to happen!"	At last they came to the dog catcher's place.	When Daddy fished Raggedy Ann from the water, Marcella hugged her so tightly to her breast the water ran from Raggedy Ann and dripped all over Marcella's apron.	"My!	Mamma and Daddy said the kittens could stay in the nursery and belong to Marcella, so Marcella took them back to Fido's basket while she hunted names for them out of a fairy tale book.	The dolls drew to one side, where Raggedy Ann and Uncle Clem whispered together.	Even then Mamma mouse was out in the barn with her children, warning them to beware of kittens and cats.	said Marcella.	"You'll have the little girl after you!	[Illustration] Then Dinah put Raggedy Ann's feet in the wringer and turned the crank.	"She and I are having a lovely time playing."	Cheery!	Presently the robins returned and quarreled at Raggedy Ann for laying so close to their nest, but Raggedy Ann only smiled at them and did not move.	[Illustration] [Illustration] RAGGEDY ANN'S TRIP ON THE RIVER When Marcella had a tea party out in the orchard, of course all of the dolls were invited.	Mamma did not tell Marcella that she had been cross and naughty for she knew Marcella felt very sorry.	She wished us to know that we could have had all the goodies we wished, whenever we wished, if we had behaved ourselves.	"When next I was taken from the grip I was in a large, clean, light room and there were many, many girls all dressed in white aprons.	he asked.	"Oh tell us the secret!"	cried the French dolly.	So Raggedy was placed back upon the shelf and the paint ran from her head and trickled down upon her dress.	"Tell us what you have been thinking, dear Raggedy," said the tin soldier.	[Illustration] [Illustration] Peterkins was too large to sleep in the nursery, so he had a nice cozy dog-house under the grape arbor.	When the Fairies' music ceased and they had flown away, Raggedy Ann and Fido returned to Raggedy's bed to think it all out.
