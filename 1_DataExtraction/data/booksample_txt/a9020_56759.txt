I’ve hardly got my breath yit.	“I only took what was my own.	“He’s somewhere about the barn, with a lantern,” replied the woman, regarding him with some curiosity.	There, Phin, I guess you can go along with the belly now.	“What do you say, Harry?” asked Len.	And where’ll ye be agin in less’n no time, if ye ain’t plaguy careful?	------------------------------------------------------------------------                              CHAPTER XXXVII                      ONE OF THE DEACON’S BLUNDERS.	ALONE in her lonely little house, in the closing twilight, Aunt Patsy had put up the leaf of her rickety pine table, and, having placed upon it a pewter plate and a cracked teacup, was busy preparing her humble supper,—bending over the hearth, toasting a crust of bread on a fork, beside a simmering teapot,—when the door was softly pushed open and somebody looked in.	But he went in just as I did,—swimming under water.	The deacon was touched; and even Phin looked conscience-smitten,—white about the mouth, and scared and excited about the eyes,—as he thought of his share in Jack’s disgrace.	I’m sure this money is bogus!—I wish I had called to ’em ’fore they got out o’ hearin’!” “Why didn’t ye?” asked Jack.	Byron in the mean time carefully tested one of the coins, cutting it with his knife and ringing it on the hearth.	“’T will keep me out of mischief, while I’m waiting.	Two or three times he turned his head, and there was the dim shape striding upon his heels, with a hand outstretched to grasp him, he more than once imagined.	There the harness was quickly taken off.	“Bless you, dear boy!	Kate clung to him with affection and wild grief.	“How happy he is!” thought Jack, following him with yearning eyes.	I want to keep you close by my side, for a few hours anyway.	“Here!	“Aft’noon!” said Hick.	Didn’t think of that, did ye?	He placed his stool beside one of them; and there he sat milking in the cool of the morning,—keeping all the while an anxious lookout for the deacon,—when the large front gate rattled, and he saw a man trying to unfasten it.	“Say, Dock!” said Hank (nickname for Henry), skulking behind some bushes, “le’s put for Chatford’s orchard, and scatter rines by the way, so if we’re tracked the old man’ll think ’t was the deacon’s boys hooked his melons.” “Go ahead!” said Dock (nickname for Jehoshaphat), carrying two fine ripe melons on his left arm while he dug into one of them with a jack-knife in his right hand.	“That’s all!” And he limped away towards the house.	“Either cross over, or go round by the bridge.” “Here comes an old wheat-boat; maybe the steersman ’ll put us across,” said Sellick.	talking to the family.	To-morrow I’ll see about it.” “To-morrow!” echoed Jack, with a fierce laugh.	“We may as well go home.” They walked back past the tree which Hod, in his imperfect attire, was still clubbing for the obstinate trousers, getting mad at them finally, and pelting them as if they were to blame for sitting there so quietly on the limb, in spite of him.	The idea of finding so much money, and then of having it taken from me, made me wild; I wasn’t myself; but I guess I’m all right now, and I hope you’ll forgive me,” he said, winking away a tear or two.	how they have abused you!’ why, then, you haven’t known what a real friend I am to you.	“Moses will be glad enough to go.	I’m a constable, you know.	Be quick, for we can’t stay much longer ’n it’ll take to finish our melons.” Notwithstanding his anxious doubts, Jack was persuaded that the best thing he could do was to run in all haste for the deacon, leaving Lion, Peternot, and the Huswick boys to watch each other and take care of the treasure in his absence.	“I took him yisterday, and he took me this morning—by surprise.	Or Lion took the old man down and held him while his young master bore off the coin.	Don’t wait for me longer than that.	“We must all help.	Do come quick!	May be cool ridin’.—In your hands?	He went behind his counter, lit a lamp, looked at your half-dollar, cut into it, and then flung it into his drawer.” “Kept it!” gasped out Jack.	She was greatly surprised when told that Jack was not to accompany her.	And now a man in a buggy was observed whipping his horse rather fast down the main street of the village.	The squire continued reading:— “_The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites._” A thrill of terror crept over poor Jack, who could not help thinking that all this applied, somehow, particularly to himself.	“What’s yer name?” “Jack Hazard.” “Ockepation?” “I work for Mr. Chatford.” “What did ye do ’fore that?” (Another bite.)	“Mebby we shall fall in with ’em, crossin’ the pastur’,” said Hank.	“No, it wasn’t!” Jack maintained stoutly.	“Sick!” said Duffer, cracking his whip, and the dog started.	Mr. Chatford walked from the house to the barn and back again, and about the yard and stables, in an absent-minded way, frowning, and looking strangely uneasy in his mind.	“It’s Mr. Chatford!” He knew the deacon’s peculiar “_Ca dep!_” (get up) to the horse.	“To think of my keepin’ you standin’ outside!	“I was dreadful ’fraid you wouldn’t come back,” said the old woman, welcoming him.	That’s nat’ral.	I didn’t know what I wanted to run away for.	If you hadn’t lied to me, and got me out of the way first, you never would have taken that money,—somebody would have been hurt first!” “Look out!” said Cub, seizing a broken branch, and advancing towards the audacious youngster.	She went on into another room, and Mr. Chatford commenced talking to Phin.	The wagon was standing before a grocery, on the corner of the street and the canal.	Guess he’d wish—” “Mr.	me an’ you’s got to go over to the Basin with the squire, on business.	“It don’t seem like the Huswick tribe to part with plunder once fairly in their hands, for fear of a writ out arter ’em.	You’re a rich man now.	“No matter; money is all right; we can afford to lose a pair of stockin’s or two,” was Hank’s consolatory remark.	“If that don’t beat all!” said Mrs. Chatford.	on my land!” and the gray eyes glittered.	“Seems to be a dispute about it.	“Now I feel as if I had traded myself off for another boy.	I am amazed that anybody in this house should be found to excuse or stand up for such a profane, house-breakin’, hardened little villain!” “I don’t stand up for anything he has said or done that is wrong.	Sellick ran back to a safe place, and descended quickly to the edge of the pond, just in time to see Jack come up once, gasp, turn heavily in the water, and sink again.	“If you git out of this scrape, I shouldn’t wonder if I would hire you.	“Promise me you’ll stay here!” Jack couldn’t help laughing at the old man’s simplicity.	I hope you haven’t been getting into any serious trouble.” They found the squire sitting stiffly in a straight-backed chair, with his horn-headed cane between his knees, and his hat and an odd-looking bundle on the floor beside him.	“I shall never eat anything in this house again!” he exclaimed, with short, convulsive sobs.	The deacon hastily untied the bag, looked into it, and then as hastily tied it up again.	Let Squire Peternot claim it if he can!” Yet Jack longed to tell somebody of his discovery.	what have you done with ’em?” cried Jack, choking with impatience and anger.	“Don’t you think you’ve been a little too hard on our good neighbor Peternot?	Is that the best he can do, I wonder?” Peternot soon showed that he could do better, his voice rising as he proceeded in a manner that greatly encouraged Jack, who now slipped from his corner, in order to make an observation.	He was still nourishing in his excited mind these fiery fancies, when, the milking over, he went to walk in the orchard; having all sorts of fearful adventures with the gaunt old Peternot, and always coming off triumphant with his treasure.	That must ’a’ been the trunk, and he hid it in the woods.	Why, he’s the party at fault, if anybody!	He did not press Peternot, to know what that “something fair and liberal” should be.	She took his hand with one of hers, and laid the other kindly and soothingly upon his shoulder.	I don’t want it to make trouble ’twixt me and my neighbors, though; and, Byron, if you are going over to the deacon’s, you might see what he has to say about it; tell him it’s counterfeit, and that I thought so—kind o’ thought so—all along, but considered it my duty—you understand?” Byron understood, and smilingly replied that he would “make it all right” for his uncle.
