"No one would visit her," muttered Jem, who had often inveighed at the folly of social prejudice.	"It will be very unromantic if you don't get anything to try your constancy," said Flossy, teasingly.	Mary, the third, was slightly the cleverer of the four, and had aspirations in less obvious directions; consequently, she fulfilled the claims of her actual state in life a little less perfectly; while Kitty, the youngest, was the softest, prettiest, and most attractive of them all, and had the greatest claim to stand alone as a beauty.	"Why, Flossy," said Mysie, "I think he's only what old Miss Rogers used to call `Mr Right.'"	"Then you will send the children down to the Rectory, Alice?"	I will talk to father first."	And when Hugh's thoughts took that turn he sometimes felt as if he were making a sort of secret atonement.	"Oh, I did not see you--I--I'll go!"	But as she has lost the   exceptional power that made it expedient, and is still, I believe,   under eighteen, it seems desirable that she should turn her mind in   another direction.	Don't you trouble yourself, Arty.	It was of Mysie that he thought hour after hour, of her face and her voice and her sweet eyes, and of every word and look they had exchanged during their brief and sweet betrothal.	"Oh, yes," said Hugh; "I wish you joy, and certainly would not be the means of interfering with your good fortune."	It was Mr Spencer who met us at Caletto.	I must just cross over and speak to him."	Frederica, in her white muslin and red ribbons, was teasing Snap.	"He mentioned you in one of his letters.	But I should not have cried at it."	Had not Hugh stroked the long, soft hair?	That is to say, all his brains--and they were good ones--had been given to the composition of Greek and Latin, and to the acquirement of the knowledge necessary to the attainment of a good degree.	She used to walk up and down my room and spout poetry till her eyes would flash!	How should you like-- you never thought that I should be engaged to anyone?"	"Well," she said, "I don't suppose you will ever make a great hand at it; but I should think you might get to act well enough not to spoil your singing if you were stronger and less frightened."	Who doesn't?"	Don't you know, Violante, there is so much within us that cannot come out, and art--music--acting is a means of expressing it.	"Oh, yes; Miss Venning knows her aunt, I believe."	"Arthur," said Miss Venning, in a deep, full voice, somewhat appalling to hear, "if you had anything particular to say to Miss Crofton, you have ample opportunities without following her here."	James was so horrified with this view of Hugh's situation that he began vehemently to controvert it, and was ready to recommend a renewal of the acquaintance rather than the rejection of it on such a motive.	The poor child had many weary yearning hours; but pleasure and novelty and affectionate kindness were not powerless; nor was she miserable.	"Yes, but I believe there's nothing extraordinary about her.	I meant to tell you.	He had meditated much on the scene of the olive-leaves; but, in the new light thrown on Arthur's mind, it had lost much of its sting.	"But flower-girls always do smile, Mr Crichton."	Her mind went on, even in these first sad days, to plans for a little lightening the cloud that covered them; and she was not a person who could sympathise with an unhappiness of which she did not thoroughly admit the necessity, or the duration of which she thought extreme.	Hugh crossed the lawn, but had he wished to win Mysie for himself he could hardly have felt a bitterer pang of jealousy than that which came upon him as he looked at Arthur's gladsome eyes and heard the proud satisfaction in his tones through all their embarrassment.	She had not taken so vivid an interest in each one of her pupils, nor been so anxious to extend her sphere of labour, that she could scarcely, as Flossy's sisters said, see a girl passing in the street without wanting to teach her, and had always a plea for extending some of the advantages of Oxley Manor "just this once" to some poor little outsider who stood just "next" in the social scale to those who already enjoyed them.	"I don't know why I am talking such nonsense," he added.	said Miss Venning, still judicial, but interested.	"I came back because I supposed there would be things to attend to," said Hugh, in an odd unnatural voice.	Of course, father, I see _all_ the risks--they are fearful ones; but the other way is such certain misery," said Rosa, faltering.	Presently he said: "I'll go and change my things.	George and Frederica went to church again for the sake of something to do; but they could not go to the Rectory afterwards, and came home to find their aunt, James, and Miss Venning gathered round a small, unaccustomed-looking fire, with some tea on the table, while Hugh sat at the far end of the long room by himself.	With fatigue and weariness such as he had never known before he stumbled over the heather, and came at last into Fordham village as the church clock struck half-past eleven.	"She--she _may_ not die."	ah, she is no good at all," said Signor Mattei, mournfully--"_she_ can do nothing."	Why, what have you been doing?"	I daresay the change will distract his mind and do him good."	"Signor Mattei is not with you?"	"Now go to your lessons."	Signorina, I love you; though I cannot tell you so in persuasive words.	I could never give Arthur up, and there will be plenty of time for you to see, as he says he thinks that--that--there must be a year at least.	"Mr Fairfax is not a youth, father," said Rosa, slightly hurt; "he is five-and-thirty, and he has a very good income, which he will explain to you, himself, to-night, if you will allow him.	The words fell on Violante's ears with a double sense: she hid her face in her hands, and ran out of the room, down through the olive trees, towards the lake.	And James was suddenly seized with a sensation of fierce unreasonable jealousy on his brother's account.	"If you please, sir, I don't know."	she said, as Rosa ventured a remonstrance.	and, in the little laugh that followed Flossy's return to her natural inclination for argument, Arthur took his leave.	"Have you read much of your own literature--Dante or Tasso?"	"Profanation!"	"I was obliged to come up on business, and I thought I should find you here--sooner or later," said Hugh, thinking his brother's excitement unnecessary.	Hugh's the last fellow I should have suspected of--of--" "Making such a fool of himself?"	Hugh would not interfere, save by the brief remark: "Yes, things are wrong; but it will take more than that to set them right;" but at last he said: "You do not wish to go, Arthur?"	"No, father;" answered Violante, with a sudden droop into her old timid self and falling into silence.	Extravagant as was the language, there was real distress in his faltering voice and tearful eyes.	For you see, Hugh, we know all about each other so well."	Violante caught the prevailing tone and worshipped Miss Florence with innocent ardour.	"Don't you know, mother, how it was?"	Rosa's fears were fulfilled.	I wonder if I could make her see how to do it--it seems such incredible incapacity.	And then there's Hugh, who won't dance four times with a girl for fear of `exciting false expectations,' has gone and broken her heart--if hearts ever are broken.	"I shall go and look at her," said Emily.	said Emily, wickedly.	He was so weary of his heavy heart.	She could make her dresses, too, _not_ quite so well as the dressmaker, and was much prouder of them than of the drawing or the book either.	She would have expected him to fall a victim to Violante at once.	And there," taking it from the chair, "is another one for you."	"I never would!"	"What became of him?	Arthur's involuntary laugh at her _naive_ statement died away as her question recalled the very sweetest, brightest picture of his English Mysie, in her white Sunday dress, walking down the churchyard path.	Filled with a wild, exaggerated sense of blood-guiltiness, he counted up every aggravating circumstance, his old jealousy of his cousins' happiness--his impatience of their laughter and their love, the fact that he was Mysie's guardian, and so responsible for her lot, and that he had been hardly willing to trust her happiness to Arthur's care.	As if I should interfere with you about it!	said James.	"I don't think he was pleased to see us," said Rosa.	Arthur started up and went forward.
