_Shakuntala_.	I have examined the garden.	I too will descend.	Journeying over every sea,   His car will travel easily;   The seven islands of the earth   Will bow before his matchless worth;   Because wild beasts to him were tame,   All-tamer was his common name;   As Bharata he shall be known,   For he will bear the world alone.	_Sixth canto.	_Clown_ (_smiling_).	(_Enter the portress with a document_.)	The sacrifice is over and the good king was dismissed to-day by the hermits.	There is irony in the fact that the works of the illustrious authors mentioned have perished, that we should hardly know of their existence were it not for the tribute of their modest, youthful rival.	_Shakuntala_.	Odysseus and AEneas do not grow; they go through adventures.	The eyes with which he seems to embrace you are overflowing with tears of joy.	Then those who lived in Kanva's hermitage gave him a name.	She looks like a painted picture.	I shall be most happy to do so.	I had my way.	It is only natural that I should forget to wink when I see my darling.	_Portress_.	Himalaya therefore bids his daughter wait upon Shiva.	This will do.	Alas!	You wicked hermit-woman, go!"	(_She takes a step and looks about_.)	A voice from heaven that recited a verse when he had entered the fire-sanctuary.	I give first a somewhat detailed analysis of the matter of the poem.	Now the moment he was gone, Kanva came to the hermitage.	You are good at guessing.	Thus blindness works in men,   Love's joy to shake;   Spurning a garland, lest   It prove a snake.	_King_ (_joyfully_).	I am not guilty of such a crime.	And this is Kanva's daughter, Shakuntala.	_King_ (_joyfully_).	_Sharngarava_.	Look, Shakuntala!	Pray turn back, sir.	'Twas festival in her pure life     When budding blossoms showed;   And now she leaves you as a wife--     Oh, speed her on her road!	Take it.	Thus the great Bhavabhuti spent his life in constructing three dramas; mighty spirit though he was, he yet suffers from the very scrupulosity of his labour.	_Anusuya_.	The twilight glow is fading far     And stains the west with blood-red light,   As when a reeking scimitar     Slants upward on a field of fight.	He wanders disconsolate, finds her, and pleads with her, by her duty as a wife, by her love for her child, even by a threat of suicide.	It was not true,   But lulling phrase, my coming grief to soften:     Else in thy death, my life had ended, too.	_Boy_ (_running to his mother_).	Criticism of the large outlines of this plot would be quite unjust, for it is completely conventional.	Have you nothing to say, O King?	She is my sister.	The clown manages to detain her some little time by starting a discussion as to her art, and when she is finally permitted to depart, both she and the king are deeply in love.	The proclamation shall be made.	We have to understand the disease before we can even try to cure it.	But my heart trembles, for fear he will despise me.	(_Exit_.)	The conventional clown plays a much smaller part in this play than in the others which Kalidasa wrote.	He rejected his true wife.	Enter_ KANVA, _returning after his ablutions_.)	Thus:   Security slays nothing but ambition;     With great possessions, troubles gather thick;   Pain grows, not lessens, with a king's position,     As when one's hand must hold the sunshade's stick.	_Anusuya_.	I am going to ask her.	How feebly small are powers of mine!	Thy shafts are blossoms; coolness streams   From moon-rays: thus the poets sing;   But to the lovelorn, falsehood seems   To lurk in such imagining;   The moon darts fire from frosty beams;   Thy flowery arrows cut and sting.	I am so glad, dear.	And off he chases on a summer noon through woods where shade is few and far between.	But I shall be a burden to you.	My soldiers are disturbing the pious grove in their search for me.	_Anusuya_.	Far the most charming of these are Shakuntala's girl friends.	(_Exit_.)	When the marriage ceremony has been happily celebrated, the disappointed suitors say farewell with pleasant faces and jealous hearts, like peaceful pools concealing crocodiles.	_King_.	How his fault distresses him!	That was why it was so impossible for me to win your confidence.	LIX     Like powder black and soft I seem to see   Thine outline on the mountain slope as bright     As new-sawn tusks of stainless ivory;   No eye could wink before as fair a sight   As dark-blue robes upon the Ploughman's shoulder white.	If you cling to a lie, and will not believe, alas!	_Clown_.	Nor is it wonderful that one whose arm   Might bolt a city gate, should keep from harm     The whole broad earth dark-belted by the sea;   For when the gods in heaven with demons fight,   Dushyanta's bow and Indra's weapon bright     Are their reliance for the victory.	My matter must await a fitter time.	_Harita_.	For   The stems from which she gathered flowers   Are still unhealed;   The sap where twigs were broken off   Is uncongealed.	_Maid_.	How could we understand his birth?	_Mishrakeshi_.	If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law.	_King_.	_Shakuntala_.
