Genes are therefore usually referred to by the body change they bring about, and one can, for instance, speak of a “gene for color blindness”.	The remaining, unaffected cells take up the slack, however, and if the proportion of affected cells is small enough, symptoms are not visible and never become visible.	Past a certain critical point, when too many cells are made incapable of division, this is no longer possible.	Chemicals can interfere with the process of replication by offering alternate pathways with which the cellular machinery is not prepared to cope.	Furthermore, one can’t predict which chromosome combination in the sperm cell will end up in combination with which in the egg cell, so that by this reasoning, a single married couple could produce children with any of 100 trillion (100,000,000,000,000) possible chromosome combinations.	Those affected by genetic damage drop out and the slack is taken up by those not affected.	Thus, there are genes governing eye color, one of which is sufficiently important to be considered a “gene for blue eyes” and another a “gene for brown eyes”.	These deleterious genes make up the _genetic load_.	These undesirable genes may be passed along for generations, even if dominant, before natural selection culls them out.	(See page 34.	In that case, the equilibrium level for that gene will be lower than it would otherwise be.	To put it another way, Americans are just about tripling their radiation dosage by reason of the human activities that are now adding man-made radiation to the natural supply.	If a particular enzyme (or group of enzymes) is, for any reason, formed imperfectly or not at all, this may show up as some visible abnormality of the body—an inability to see color, for instance, or the possession of two joints in each finger rather than three.	There is no recovery, because the sex cells, after formation, do not work in cooperation, and affected cells are not replaced by those that are unaffected.	The heterozygotes, or carriers, who possess a single gene of this sort, and who live out normal lives, keep that gene in being.	The workings of the gene-repair mechanism ought (it is to be hoped) eventually to be puzzled out.	The truth seems to be that the gene pool, as it exists now, supplies us with all the variability we need for the effective working of the evolutionary mechanism.	_Genetics in the Atomic Age_ (second edition), Charlotte Auerbach,   Oxford University Press, Inc., Fair Lawn, New Jersey 07410, 1965, 111   pp., $2.50.	The total number of mutations would increase from 100 to 102—an increase of 2%, not an increase of 200% that one would expect if all spontaneous mutations were caused by background radiation.	If the same dose is delivered over years, only a small bit of radiation is absorbed on any given day and only small proportions of growing cells lose the capacity for division at any one time.	After the crossover, one would carry genes for blue eyes and straight hair, the other for brown eyes and wavy hair.	When mutated body cells divide, new cells with changed characteristics are produced.	As conditions change, one combination of varieties might gain over another and this, in turn, might produce changes in body characteristics that would then further alter the relative “goodness” or “badness” of certain gene patterns.	We must be careful how we use this term.	The body is, so to speak, continually repairing the radiation damage and no serious symptoms will develop.	Yet one can see that the genetic load is quite heavy and that anything that would tend to increase it would certainly be undesirable, and perhaps even dangerous.	Enough chemical bonds may be disrupted so that a chromosome struck by a high-energy wave or particle may break into fragments.	What’s more, whereas X rays used in diagnosis and therapy have a humane purpose and chiefly affect the patient who hopes to be helped in the process, nuclear fallout affects all of humanity without distinction and seems, to many people, to have as its end only the promise of a totally destructive nuclear war.	The heat thus formed is sufficient to cause atoms and molecules to vibrate more rapidly, but this added vibration is not usually sufficient to pull molecules apart and therefore does not bring about chemical changes.

[6] [Illustration: _Studies at the California Institute of Technology furnish information on the nature of radiation effects on genes.	Fertilization added the father’s chromosome, which made three Nos.	On the other hand, it is only fair to point out that the foregoing appraisal may be an over-optimistic view.	What is left of the atom will carry a positive electric charge with the charge size proportional to the number of electrons lost.	That is why there is no threshold in the genetic effect of radiation and why there is no “safe” amount of radiations insofar as genetic effects are concerned.	The genetic load might increase to the point where the species as a whole would degenerate and fade toward extinction—a sort of “racial radiation sickness”.	The _roentgen_, abbreviated _r_, and named in honor of the discoverer of X rays, Wilhelm Roentgen, is a unit based on the number of ions produced by radiation.	In a world in which human beings are more mobile than they have ever been in history and in which intercultural marriages are increasingly common, information on this point is particularly important.	It will redden the skin, stimulate the production of pigment, and break up certain steroid molecules to form vitamin D. It will even interfere with replication to some extent.	It is those persons with nearsightedness, with diabetes, and so on, who, with the aid of glasses, insulin, or other props, can go on to live normal lives and have children in the usual numbers.	On the other hand, it is _not_ correct to argue, as some do, that an increase in mutation rate might be actually beneficial.	Radiations may consist of flying particles, too, and if these carry sufficient energy they are also ionizing in character.	There is overwhelming evidence to indicate that this is true in general, although there are specific instances where it is not completely true and scientists must tread softly while drawing conclusions.	This opens a door for the future, too.	Such changes are called _mutations_.	In the first place, environment is not fixed.	Suppose only one sex cell out of a million is damaged.

Nearsightedness would therefore spread more generally through civilized societies than through primitive ones.	Note that the tracks are much farther apart than those of alpha particles.	All these radiations can bring about somatic mutations—all can cause cancer, for instance.	It seems reasonable that random changes in the gene pattern are almost sure to be bad.	When an individual is heterozygous for a particular characteristic, it frequently happens that he shows the effect associated with only one of the gene varieties.	The situation is rather analogous to that of a man who owns a good house that is heavily mortgaged.	Such creatures may have fewer chromosomes than man does and the sites of mutation are more easily pinned down.	Sometimes through the accidental jostling of molecules a wrong turn may be taken, and the result is a spontaneous mutation.	If he were offered a second house with a similar mortgage, he would have to refuse.	The chromosomes of the pair may carry different varieties: A gene for blue eyes on one chromosome and one for brown eyes on the other.	Those persons with two such genes, who alone show the bad effects, are like the visible portion of an iceberg and represent only a small part of the whole.	The only safe course for mankind then is to err, if it must, strongly on the side of conservatism.	However, near-misses may also be deadly.	Sometimes, then, one speaks of the _relative biological effectiveness_ (RBE) of radiation, or the _roentgen equivalent, man_ (rem).	Each chromosome can be considered as being composed of small sections called _genes_, usually pictured as being strung along the length of the chromosome.	Those with strongly deleterious genes either die despite all that can be done for them even today or, at the least, do not have a chance to have many children.	One estimate, involving a number of technologically advanced countries (including the United States) showed that an average of somewhere between 0.02 and 0.18 rem per year was absorbed, as a result of radiations (usually X rays) used in medical diagnosis and therapy.	It may be that the usefulness of a single deleterious gene is greater than we may suspect in many cases, and that there are greater advantages to heterozygousness than we know.	People possessing two such genes usually die young.	When the rate of removal equals the rate of production, a condition of _genetic equilibrium_ is reached and the level of occurrence of that gene then remains stable over the generations.	In a human being, however—even in an adult who is no longer experiencing overall growth—there are many tissues whose cells must undergo division throughout life.	It is generally believed that the straight line continues all the way down without deviation to very low radiation absorptions.	It will then kill even though the corresponding gene on the other chromosome of the pair is normal.	Dr. Muller won a Nobel Prize in 1946 for showing that radiation can cause mutations.	Background Radiation Ionizing radiation in low intensities is part of our natural environment.	[Illustration: _Geneticist Hermann J. Muller studying_ Drosophila _in his laboratory.	At the very end of an electron track the proximity of the ions approximates that in an alpha-particle track._] Ionizing radiation is capable of imparting so much energy to molecules as to cause them to vibrate themselves apart, producing not only ions but also high-energy uncharged molecular fragments called _free radicals_.	Even within the populations of the three major nuclear powers there are strong feelings that the possible benefits of nuclear testing do not balance the certain dangers.	Then, too, even when a gene molecule is replicated perfectly, it may undergo change afterward through the action upon it of some chemical or other environmental influence.

A heterozygote possessing only one of these genes is not seriously affected and has red blood cells that are, apparently, less appetizing to malaria parasites.	In every generation those individuals with a gene pattern that fit them better for their environment won out over those with less effective patterns—won out in the race for food, for mates, and for safety.	X rays and gamma rays are therefore examples of _ionizing radiation_.	If so, a damaged sex cell will, on the average, take part in one out of every million fertilizations.
