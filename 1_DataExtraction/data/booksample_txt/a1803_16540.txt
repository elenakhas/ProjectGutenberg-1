On three sides of the pedestal are bas-relief designs illustrating some of his works, whereby three fellow-countrymen added to their fame; and on the fourth is a fine inscription in Latin, setting forth his talents, and his virtues, and the honours conferred on him, and stating in conclusion (on the authority of his eulogizer) that his works have gained for him immortality.	So Monsieur the Viscount dragged his pallet away from the toad, placed another stone by it, and removed the pitcher; and then, wearied with his efforts, lay down and slept heavily.

This was a funny account; but the speaker looked so far from funny that one of the sisters, who was very tender-hearted, crept up to him, and said, gently-- "Richard is only joking; he doesn't really want to get rid of us.	The way had seemed long to come, it was short to look back upon, and now the golden gates were almost reached, the everlasting doors were open.	"I have seen them," said the tutor, "in Monsieur Claude's pocket.	I had a strong natural desire to be pretty, but I felt sure I had been taught somehow that it was much more meritorious not to care about it.	Be calm, my child: consider that even if truly also the fast-bound-eternally-immutable-condition of everlastingly-varying-circumstance--" But by this time Friedrich was at home.	Let them wrap the book carefully up, put it in the hole, and replace the bricks.

So they met, and so they parted; and as Monsieur the Viscount went back to his prison, he flattered himself that the last link was broken for him in the chain of earthly interests.	"Tell me, my friend, has there ever been, since you first began your career, a bit of homage or approbation that has really pleased you?"

I am glad he is my godfather.	"Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.	"Be hoff with you," he said.	and Friedrich went home with two sentences ringing in his head-- "Do I mean to be a dunce all my life?"	I took pleasure in trying to make her as angry as myself.
