Earth has not any thing to shew more fair:   Dull would he be of soul who could pass by   A sight so touching in its majesty:   This City now doth like a garment wear   The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,   Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie   Open unto the fields, and to the sky;   All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.	While riding near her home one stormy night   A single Glow-worm did I chance to espy;   I gave a fervent welcome to the sight,   And from my Horse I leapt; great joy had I.	my spirits play           With kindred motion:                             60   At dusk, I've seldom mark'd thee press   The ground, as if in thankfulness,   Without some feeling, more or less,           Of true devotion.	With a tiger-leap half way   Now she meets the coming prey,   Lets it go as fast, and then   Has it in her power again:   Now she works with three or four,   Like an Indian Conjuror;                                   30   Quick as he in feats of art,   Far beyond in joy of heart.	I know not which way I must look   For comfort, being, as I am, opprest,   To think that now our Life is only drest   For shew; mean handywork of craftsman, cook,   Or groom!	With his lance Sir Eustace pointed,   And to Hubert thus said he,   "What I speak this Horn shall witness   For thy better memory.	"Nay but I gave her pence, and she will buy you bread."	Art thou the Bird whom Man loves best,   The pious Bird with the scarlet breast,       Our little English Robin;   The Bird that comes about our doors   When Autumn winds are sobbing?	Festively she puts forth in trim array;   As vigorous as a Lark at break of day:   Is she for tropic suns, or polar snow?	And, almost as it was when ships were rare,   From time to time, like Pilgrims, here and there   Crossing the waters; doubt, and something dark,   Of the old Sea some reverential fear,   Is with me at thy farewell, joyous Bark!	16.	_THE SAILOR'S MOTHER_.

What strife would then be yours, fair Creatures, driv'n   Now up, now down, and sparkling in your glee!	Seven years, alas, to have received   No tidings of an only child;   To have despair'd, and have believ'd,                    10   And be for evermore beguil'd;   Sometimes with thoughts of very bliss!	dear Girl!	For who could be,   Who, even the best, in such condition, free   From self-reproach, reproach which he must share   With Human Nature?	4.	We had a fellow-Passenger who came   From Calais with us, gaudy in array,   A Negro Woman like a Lady gay,   Yet silent as a woman fearing blame;   Dejected, meek, yea pitiably tame,   She sate, from notice turning not away,   But on our proffer'd kindness still did lay   A weight of languid speech, or at the same   Was silent, motionless in eyes and face.

I'd rather be   A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;   So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,   Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;   Have sight of Proteus coming from the sea;   Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.	9.

In all my walks, through field or town,     Such Figure had I never seen:     Her face was of Egyptian brown:     Fit person was she for a Queen,                        10     To head those ancient Amazonian files:   Or ruling Bandit's Wife, among the Grecian Isles.

None could tell if it were night-time,   Night or day, at even or morn;   For the sound was heard by no one   Of the proclamation-horn.	How piteous then that there should be such dearth   Of knowledge; that whole myriads should unite   To work against themselves such fell despite:   Should come in phrenzy and in drunken mirth,   Impatient to put out the only light   Of Liberty that yet remains on Earth!	END OF THE FIRST PART.	Months pass'd on, and no Sir Eustace!	7.	Dear fellow Traveller!	This tiresome night, O Sleep!	"Fear not," quickly answer'd Hubert;   "As I am thy Father's son,   What thou askest, noble Brother,   With God's favour shall be done."	Methought I saw the footsteps of a throne   Which mists and vapours from mine eyes did shroud,   Nor view of him who sate thereon allow'd;   But all the steps and ground about were strown   With sights the ruefullest that flesh and bone   Ever put on; a miserable crowd,   Sick, hale, old, young, who cried before that cloud,   "Thou art our king, O Death!

The ancient Spirit is not dead;     Old times, thought I, are breathing there;     Proud was I that my country bred     Such strength, a dignity so fair:                      10     She begg'd an alms, like one in poor estate;   I look'd at her again, nor did my pride abate.
