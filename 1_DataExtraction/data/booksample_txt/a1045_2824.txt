According to tradition, the young Niflung, son of Hogni, the last of his race, had there ended darkly a sad and unsuccessful life.	We could not by any possibility have touched him.	It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.	One of the esquires said with a low sigh: "The Lord have mercy on his poor wild soul!"	The good Rolf looked sorrowfully in the boy’s face, saying, “Ah, my dear young master, you are so much better than you would make people believe.	Folko made a sign to the pale Gabrielle to retire behind his followers, saying to her, "Be of good cheer, my noble wife, weaker Christians have braved, for the sake of God and of His holy Church, greater dangers than now seem to threaten us.	It addressed him in a grating man's voice: "Well, my brave young knight, whence come you?	"To be sure he accepted them," whispered the little Master.	They could never exactly ascertain the situation of the rocks on which their vessel stranded; but so much is certain, that very near the sea-shore stood a huge castle, to which the father and son betook themselves, seeking for that assistance and shelter which Christian people are ever willing to afford each other in case of need.	Next they repair to the houses where strangers and travellers receive hospitality at their cost; and at last they return to their own abode, to entertain their guests, rich and noble like kings, and simple and unconstrained like shepherds.	In a low voice he said, “Proceed, noble baron.	"See, my son," began the old man, softly and mildly, "I have lain for a long time in a death-like sleep, and have known nothing of what was going on around me; but within,--ah!	I am therefore accustomed to see him so; though, at the first, I too was disquieted by it.	His fall gave the signal for that of all Eric’s army.	The Lord will be with me, as He was with those holy men.	“The wise man up there knows me well.	He suffered it to approach so near that its fearful claws were almost upon him; then he made a thrust, and the spear-head was buried deep in the bear’s breast.	It must surely have all been a foreboding of our poor young Lord Sintram, whom I love as if he were my own child; and now the words of the weeping father in the Gospel often come into my mind,--‘Lord, I believe; help Thou my unbelief;’ and something similar I may very likely have repeated to-day as a chant or a prayer.	We have overcome.	He almost thought that he must have missed the traces of the fearful beast; when close beside him from a cleft in the rock issued a long growl, and a huge black bear appeared on the snow, standing on its hind legs, and with glaring eyes it advanced towards the baron.	Near also is the downfall of thy dearest happiness."	He again stretched out his hand towards the boar’s head, as if about to make some dreadful vow, when Folko snatched a gauntlet of Biorn’s off the table, with which he, with his unwounded left arm, struck so powerful a blow on the gilt idol, that it fell crashing to the ground, shivered to pieces.	asked Montfaucon.	Thrilling with strange forebodings, but nevertheless strong and vigorous in spirit, Sintram did according to the holy man's desire.	There was nothing in thy heroic feat.	Sometimes, if he had been reckoning up the nights till it should come, a cold sweat would stand on his forehead, while he said, "Mark my words, dear old foster-father, this time something most awfully decisive lies before me."	Thereupon I awoke; and I knew that all depended upon whom thou wouldst bring with thee.	Stooping suddenly to avoid some overhanging branches, he unexpectedly came upon something against which he had almost struck, and which, at first sight, he took for a small bear standing on its hind legs, with a long and strangely crooked horn on its head.	Folko the while called up all the brightness of his fancy, all his courtly grace, in order to make Gabrielle forget that she was living in this wild castle, and that the long, hard northern winter was setting in, which would ice them in for many a month.	whither go you?	In half-an-hour we shall come out of this passage, and we shall be in thy beauteous lady's apartment.	"Those are wise and pious thoughts," replied Folko calmly, "and I will treasure them in a pure heart."	For, my lord, either I am mad and have forgotten all that is past, or that Being has met you in the wood, whom I look upon as my very powerful twin brother."	Here one day three beautiful sorceresses appeared to him, disputing about a golden apple; and from him they sought to know which of them was the most beautiful, since to her the golden fruit was to be awarded.	Suddenly a cloudy shadow passed over him, and he looked up, expecting to see a flight of cranes in the air; but the sky was clear and blue.	who would dare accompany?"	The she-bear and her whelps will be upon me, and I cannot use my right arm!	The pleased smile of the youth seemed to say, Yes; and the pilgrim, touching the strings with a light hand, sang these words:                   "Sleep peacefully, dear boy;                      Thy mother sends the song                    That whispers round thy couch,                      To lull thee all night long.	But Rolf stopped him, and said, entreatingly: “My dear young master, you would do better to take your meal to-day alone here in your own apartment; for there is a guest with your father, in whose company I should be very sorry to see you.	And how can one single night have so fearfully altered you?” Sintram stood still, thunderstruck, and feeling as if he himself did not know what had befallen him.	But before he went down, he caused a shield to be brought, saw himself therein, and cut close round, in grief and horror, the rest of his long black hair, so that he made himself look almost like a monk; and thus he joined the others already assembled round the table.	But at the same time also, a tall, gigantic, haggard figure passed along the valley, in some measure like the departed pilgrim, only much, very much, larger, and he raised his long bony arm fearfully threatening, then disappeared in an ancient tomb.	“I bring a precious Christmas gift,”  said the priest.	"Some welcome visitor must have arrived," said the knight; and he spurred his horse to a quicker pace over the dewy meadow.	Have you not a lute here?"	Now midst yonder hostile ranks,               In his warlike pride he meets us,               Folko comes!	The mysterious man seemed to be the while listening to the motionless air, as if he were hearing a most pleasant discourse or lofty music; and as Rolf was about to speak, he made him a sign of entreaty to remain quiet, and continued in his eager listening attitude.	And with detestable craft he wove in that tale with what was actually happening, bringing in the most highly wrought praises of the lovely Gabrielle; and alas!	the noblest victory!	Give heed awhile."	About this time,--when Christmas was drawing near, and Sintram was seeking to overpower his dread of the awful dreams by the most daring expeditions,--about this time, Folko and Gabrielle stood together on one of the terraces of the castle.	Then Gabrielle buckled on his sword, saying, "For the honour of God and the service of virtuous ladies, young knight.	Sintram gave his horse hastily to some retainers in the court-yard, and ran up the steps, whilst Skovmark stayed by the well-known horse.	But if a promise binds thee, it is different.	When he was tended by your mother in the castle, and when even your father still showed himself kind towards him, he asked, as a favour, that his armour and his lance should be allowed to hang in Biorn's armoury--Weigand himself, as you well know, intended to build a cloister and to live there as a monk--and he put his old esquire's helmet with it, instead of another, because he was yet wearing that one when he first saw the fair Verena's angelic face.	The Knight of Montfaucon, pale and bleeding, was half kneeling against the rock; his right arm, crushed in his fall, hung powerless at his side; it was plain that he could not draw his good sword out of the scabbard.	And must I forego the joy of seeing you fight?	Just then the warder blew his horn from his tower, and a trooper came into the room with a look of surprise.

"Not yet, my Sintram.	my foster-child, darling of my heart, what has come over thee, thus fearfully stirring thee to rage?” The youth stood awhile as if spell-bound; he looked in his old friend’s face with a fixed and melancholy gaze, and his eyes became dim, like expiring watch-fires seen through a thick cloud of mist.	The good Rolf was often with Folko and Gabrielle, and made a connecting link between the two widely differing parties in the castle.	Folko and Gabrielle are revived from the Magic Ring, that Folko may by example and influence enhance all higher resolutions; while Gabrielle, in all unconscious innocence, awakes the passions, and thus makes the conquest the harder.	CHAPTER 18 Sounds of wailing were heard from the castle as they approached; the chapel was solemnly lighted up; within it knelt Gabrielle, lamenting for the death of the Knight of Montfaucon.	Verena went into a cloister!"	Let me again hear you sing that lay of the land of flowers; for I am sure that it will now sound much sweeter than when you accompanied it with the vibrations of your fearful harp."	thou art come to visit me after all.	More fell on the side of those who made than of those who received the assault; and the strangers appeared to understand surprisingly the Norwegian manner of fighting.	And a few weeks ago, when the snow was yet lying hard in the valleys, I came unawares quite close upon the strange building.	It is within the bounds of possibility that the similarities of folk-lore may have brought to Fouque’s knowledge the outline of the story which Scott tells us was the germ of “Guy Mannering”; where a boy, whose horoscope had been drawn by an astrologer, as likely to encounter peculiar trials at certain intervals, actually had, in his twenty-first year, a sort of visible encounter with the Tempter, and came off conqueror by his strong faith in the Bible.	The hard spirit of the fierce lord of the castle was now quite broken, and he watched with increased humility every look of Folko and Gabrielle.	Folko rushed through--he and his war-steed unwounded--followed by a troop of chosen knights.	No, no; suffer me rather to fetch my own huge harp, strung with bears’ sinews set in brass, for in truth I do feel myself inspired to play and sing.” Gabrielle murmured a half-frightened assent; and Sintram having quickly brought his harp, began to strike it loudly, and to sing these words with a voice no less powerful:              “Sir knight, sir knight, oh!	CHAPTER 28 "He is dead!	The dry, many-coloured oak-leaves on its head were waving like the flames around a sacrifice, in the uncertain moonlight.	So be not angry, dear Rolf, if I determine to go and look that strange palmer in the face.” And he shut the door of the chamber behind him, and with firm and echoing steps proceeded to the hall.	For some pirates had sailed from the southern seas, and, hearing of the building of this monastery, their chief thought to find much gold belonging to the lord of the castle and to the master builders, or else, if he surprised and carried them off, to extort from them a mighty ransom.	“For Heaven’s sake,” whispered the good Rolf to his knight--“for Heaven’s sake, Sir Sintram, what kind of companions have you here?	They are only begging of him, and therefore they jump up so boldly round him; and he gives them bountiful alms--very bountiful, that I can assure thee.” In fact, as it seemed, the pilgrim threw some bones into the sea, and passed scatheless on his way.	"Then so let it be," replied Folko solemnly; "and if that must come forth openly which should ever have remained hidden in the darkness which belongs to such deeds of wickedness, at least let it come forth less fearfully with a sudden flash.	The knight well knew that his father was meant; and he urged on his noble steed, which now obeyed his master willingly and gladly, and the faithful dog also again ran beside him fearlessly.	Now, in his joy at again seeing his young master, he did not remark his altered appearance; but as he accompanied him to his sleeping-room he said, "Witches and spirits of the tempest must have taken up their abode on the sea-shore.
