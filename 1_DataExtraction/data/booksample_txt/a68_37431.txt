I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all.	But that gentleman seemed to think the country was nothing at all.	ELIZABETH.	Perhaps.	But how would you ever have explained things to Charlotte and Mr. Collins without his help?	This extreme delicacy of constitution would seem to be the only bar to their happiness.	WICKHAM.	One moment.	DARCY.	[_Taking her silence for encouragement._] Miss Bennet, I can well understand your own astonishment at this declaration, for I am amazed at myself!	The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or distributed: This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.	Pray let me have the basket now, Mr. Darcy.	ELIZABETH.	BINGLEY.	JANE.	MRS. BENNET.	[_Going over smilingly to_ JANE.]	Only this--that if it is so, you can have no reason to suppose Mr. Darcy will make an offer to me.	MRS. BENNET.	DARCY.	Oh, yes!	No, Jane, you stay where you are.	[_Coldly._] Your judgment in the matter of my sister's happiness has given me a gauge by which I can measure your fairness to a man who has been so unfortunate as to offend you.	[_Recovering herself._] But as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	You do not know what the result may be.	JANE.	All, Madam.	Oh!	Let us make up a set here; I think there will be room.	[_Following her._] Why _did_ I promise to dance with Mr. Darcy just now!	If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.

[_Looking about her._] It is vastly pretty, Charles, but I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball will be rather a punishment than a pleasure.	I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.	COLONEL FITZWILLIAM.	For me?	I could not bear to lose you, Eliza!	ELIZABETH.	Wickham_!	Will you present me?	Leave Netherfield!	MRS. BENNET.	ELIZABETH.	JANE.	Here I am again, Mrs. Bennet.	But you are always giving her the preference.	Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him.	I have a high respect for your nerves.	At sight of_ DARCY, WICKHAM _starts and is      greatly confused_.	[_Looking at the letter._] Why, it is from Jane!	Thank you.	This time the sight of him seems to make_ BINGLEY _somewhat angry, and he pulls himself together and speaks in a firmer tone and in a more cheerful manner_.]	DARCY.	He really cannot help it.	[ELIZABETH _turns away_.]	I had not known you a month, before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed upon to marry.	I may ask you later for dinner.	Everybody has tried to warn me.	WICKHAM.	Then who taught you?	MRS. BENNET _and_ MRS. LONG _follow them_.]	BINGLEY.	I think, with your permission, I will now retire again to the library.	JANE.	You must stay to dinner, Mr. Wickham.	General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.	You go fast, Darcy.	My daughter Anne is very fond of it, which is fortunate, since she will probably spend the most of her life there.	I share it with everyone who has the happiness of knowing you.	We shall miss it, altogether.	You may depend upon my not mentioning it.	I am so glad you think so.	MR. COLLINS.	[_Turning to_ ELIZABETH.]	[_After a slight pause, with impatience_.]	I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and I shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.	Yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed!	ALL.	[FITZWILLIAM _hesitates_.]	I must send someone for a carriage.	You must not indeed.
