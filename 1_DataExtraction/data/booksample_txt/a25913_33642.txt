She figured it out.	They took their time, adjusting their focus rods for death and destruction.	Are you ready?"	"We're not quitting 'til we finish--I'm sure of that."	I could ...	Things are going all wrong.	How is it we haven't seen it?"	... sometimes...." "I am hearing thoughts from a Lyrian on Earth," Walt said in dull amazement.	There's a lot of things funny about this boy, she thought.	**I feel infinitely better, now that she's out of the way,** the Elder commented.	"Oh, my," Julia said.	I don't know; I can't think; I can't _think_!	"Lyrians have a superficial resemblance to earthlings."	Half an hour later, Julia and Walt and the colonel reached their destination.	I can't.	She leaned against the wrecked car.	She was weak with relief.	"... you said you were on a ship?"	"What is the radius of destruction?"	A medical aide trailed up at the rear, carrying his hypodermic kit.	He sat down and huddled up to protect himself from it.	She went to the door and looked out.	He glared up at her.	He had known it was impossible to teleport higher life forms against their resistance; he had hoped she would have been caught off guard.	She braced him with her hip when he started to slip to the floor.	**If he travels fast--if he has luck--by another five hours.	"We've got rooms for you downtown."	"I'm coming to that possibility....	Could I have?	Teleporting, Walt jerked it from the man's hand and hit him behind the ear with it.	His skin was smooth and boyish.	Stop!	I should have--what should I have done?	The ship folded upon itself and collapsed into a powder of dry, red rust.	"Hello, where did you come from?"	The man brought out a cigarette lighter.	"I'm not sure.	They will cut his speed down.	It never did any good.	I'll be careful."	She raced for the entrance.	She realized something was badly wrong.	"Gas," he ordered the attendant.	"First you get ready to brain him with a tire iron and then you say he's got to live.	"Sit down beside me," he commanded.	He must ask Forential about the process by which babies are created; what was the connection between parent and child?	"I'm ready."	I'll be back soon."	I could have....	One of the general officers made a check mark on his note book.	He hurtled through her as through the air itself.	"You are in contact with her through the shielding?	** **If all goes well,** Forential thought, **we may yet succeed.	"What?"	He trembled violently and whimpered for Forential.	This is in your reports somewhere, too.	I'll phone the head office there.	The general went to the handbag.	She could feel Walt creeping up on her.	She began to dress.	Earth grew in the viewplate; expanding majestically to obliterate the surrounding space, it grew shimmery along its almost regular circumference.	The F.B.I.	Walt followed instructions.	Losing altitude, they hurtled on a sloping trajectory toward Washington.	*       *       *       *       * Julia had felt the bridge in her mind snap shut.	The answer to her question was suddenly obvious.	He closed the door and pressed against it to be as far away from the earthling as possible.	There were shadows along the far wall.	It's the same principle as concussion affecting the displacement area."	He was such an innocent!	But the required concentration was too great to be long maintained.	"We consulted with the President this morning."	I'm on the frequency of that group.	"War?"	Julia knew they were both incorrect: his statement and his conviction.
