Her feeble and delicate body yielded without a struggle; the strain had been too great.	He could have no other excuse than a desire to avoid an awkward interview, during which questions might be asked which he did not care to answer.	I remained alone all evening; I had paper before me, and was trying to collect my thoughts in order to write, but in vain.	Even were it possible that Smith could share some secret of which I knew nothing, what could be the nature of the mystery?	As a husbandman, when the storm has passed, counts the sheaves that remain in his devastated field, thus I began to estimate the evil I had done.	Nothing could be more simple or more beautiful than this landscape.	Ah!	A horrible madness seized me; I began to run here and there in search of some instrument of death.	How shall I describe it?	Then I would spring up, crying: "Impossible!"	He lay almost lifeless on the dusty field.	In vain I tried to think of some means of forcing her to enlighten me; for such power I would have given all I possessed.	It pleased me to leave them alone before the fire, and to go out on the quay to dream, leaning on the parapet and looking at the water.	"Here I am recovered and everything is ready."	Ah!	By that course you deprive yourself of the only happiness there is in the world--perfect love.	At this very moment?"	How cheerful, how free, how careless!	she cried, "you will never know how to love!"	CHAPTER V TRUTH AT LAST What a frightful weapon is human thought!	I asked.	-- "Because you are in the shadow, would you deny the existence of light?	The name of the young man I was going to see was Smith; he was living near us.	She was about to faint as I led her to a chair where she sank down and her head fell on my shoulder.	Then, when he arose to leave us, I accompanied him to the door, and stood there, pensively listening to the sound of his footsteps on the stairs.	--" Why, when that man looks at her, does she seem to fear to meet his glance?"	None, perhaps!	Since I have referred to these good moments, let me mention one of them, they were so rare.	How much do you fear my wrath when you come before me with such mimicry?	I felt ashamed of my own strategy and abandoned it.	Why do you die of hunger, clasping a priceless treasure in your hands?	I experienced a dull languor and could distinguish nothing clearly.	Just God!	Think of it.	Unless a man is brutalized by debauchery, eager curiosity is one of his marked traits.	But when he returns, the youth looks upon his sister; and see what has taken place in him during an hour passed in the society of brutal reality!	"You will do as you wish, and achieve my ruin," she said.	When with me, she had no thought but of me; why should I care to solve a mystery that did not threaten my happiness?	And all the while I was thinking neither of my responsibility, nor of the past, nor future; I thought neither of Smith nor his connection with the affair; I could not say who had led me there, or what I had done during the last hour.	To what torture canst thou submit that thou hast not already endured?	"If I should lose Brigitte?"	"Yes, I hope so."	and thy beauty, and thy love, and thy happiness, where will they be?	I did not close my eyes that night, and the next morning I resolved to call on that young man I had seen at the opera.	While thus buried in thought I tried to invent some expedient that would lead to the truth.	You have begun by being good, you will become weak, and you will become a monster.	"Is it possible," I repeated, "that I am going to lose you?	I demanded, with horror.	I do not regret those tears, for they were such as I could shed only when my heart was right; I do not speak merely of Salsdorf, and do not care for that particular instance.	Do they not raise, for some pieces of silver, the vesture of chastity, that robe so full of mystery, which respects the being it embellishes and engirds her without touching?	She called him Henri and smiled on him sweetly.	For the second time I saw tears fall from the young man's eyes; I was ready to shed tears myself, and not knowing what was passing in me, I held out my hand to him.	O child, child!	"If some one should say to me: 'You are a coward!'	No, not at present; no, not while there is between us a lie or a mask.	Behold my arms are ready to receive you; lean your head on me and weep.	"Is that all?"	What would have been the result if I had started at once on our trip?	Why should annihilation frighten thee, poor body, destined to corruption?	"If I should try this with Brigitte, she might be deceived and tell me her secret."	Whatever the secret she was concealing from me, was she not going away with me?	My anger had become furious when the idea of resorting to such trickery occurred to me.	"When do you go?"	For six months I had been engaged in that task, not a day had passed that I had not worked at that impious occupation, and I had at that moment the proof before my eyes.	I have learned how to kill, and observe that I already, weep; learn that God made me better than you see me.'	When will all this cease?"	"Listen to me," she began with an effort, "I have suffered much.	It is time for day to break, I have loved long enough in the night.	Fool that I am!	In short, since we were happy I did not see why we should make a change; and I did not think of going away at present.	There was one view that seemed to attract her more than the others; it was a certain spot in the canton of Vaud, some distance from Brigues; some trees with cows grazing in the shade; in the distance a village consisting of some dozen houses, scattered here and there.	Poor dreamer!	"Brigitte," I suddenly inquired, "what secret are you concealing from me?	I repeated aloud.	What can you hope for if you remain?	I tried to interrupt her.	fool, as you say, who would know the truth!	I am ready, as you see.	In to-morrow's journal would appear the intelligence that Octave de T----- had killed his mistress, and the day after no one would speak of it.	What evil hast thou committed that there should be placed in thy breast a fever that consumes!	Very well then, why would you leave me?	She departs with you," said the conscience."	"Why should we delude ourselves?"
