Why, I’ve often watched a ploughman, with two horses harnessed to the plough, doing his best to get it _forwards_; while the opposition-ploughman, with three donkeys harnessed at the _other_ end, was doing _his_ best to get it _backwards_!	Go and brush it _toreckly_!’ Then—‘Oh, Bruno, oo mustn’t dog’s-ear the daisies!’ Did oo learn _oor_ spelling wiz daisies, Mister Sir?” “I want to hear about that Boy’s _Birthday_,” I said.	“If she loves him truly,” (I seemed at last to grasp the clue to the problem) “is not _that_, for her, the voice of God?	“Why, of _course_ you can!” Sylvie exclaimed.	After all, I’m afraid there’s no part for you but the ‘Well-dressed Villain’: only,” with a critical side-glance, “I’m a _leetle_ uncertain about the dress!” We found Lady Muriel alone, the Earl having gone out to make a call, and at once resumed old terms of intimacy, in the shady arbour where the tea-things seemed to be always waiting.	They look like troops of hovering angels!” To _me_ they looked very ordinary clouds indeed: but then _I_ had not fed ‘_on honey-dew, And drunk the milk of Paradise_’!	“What is it like?” “Almost exactly like this one.	Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast!’ Down came the little Foxes!	As we passed the head of the lane that led down to the beach, I noticed a single figure, moving slowly along it, seawards.	“And so Bruno went back to the Lion.	If _A_ promises something to _B_, _B_ has a claim upon _A_.	“We call it ‘Artificial Selection.’” “Exactly so,” said Mein Herr.	336   Eternity, contemplation of.	“Pray don’t disturb yourself.	“Why, I had nearly forgotten the most important part of the entertainment!	“Thank you so much for coming out to tell me!” And, thinking he had now said all he had come to say, I held out my hand to bid him good night.	And be very good and obedient.’ “The Lamb’s speech.	There each would find a comfortable room provided for her, and also a cheap second-hand piano-forte, on which she might play for hours, without adding one needless pang to the sum of human misery!” Lady Muriel glanced round in alarm, lest these barbarous sentiments should be overheard.	Hip!	Bird thou never wert,   That from Heaven, or near it,     Pourest thy full heart!’” he read from the page he had spread open before her.	However, it took in _one_ of her audience, and Bruno hastened to interpose, as peacemaker in a rising quarrel, with the remark “_I_ likes Peoples!” Arthur laid a loving hand on the little curly head.	And Bruno was ever so frightened, and he ran——” “No, he wasn’t _flightened_ a bit!” Bruno interrupted.	“_Crabbed age and youth cannot live together!_” the old man cheerfully replied, with a most genial smile.	“Quick!	“Why, that’s _true_!” he murmured to himself.	“That’s Sylvie singing!	“Bruno’s speech to the Lion.	“It isn’t as hot as it might be,” the Professor replied, catching at the first idea that came to hand.	_Hadn’t_ it?” he enquired.	I could explain it in—in—but you would not understand it!” “No indeed!” said Lady Muriel, graciously dispensing with the _name_ of the unknown language.	Assuming it to have no _moral_ responsibility, isn’t that a greater mystery than a man over-driving a horse?” “I think it _is_,” said Lady Muriel, looking a mute appeal to her father.	Now let me ask you _another_ question.	“It’s too important a question to be settled by Amateurs!	“Something wonderful—like  Fortunatus’s Purse?	After the Examination, he mentioned to me the few facts which he knew but had _not_ been able to bring in, and I can assure you they were trivial, Sir, absolutely trivial!” I feebly expressed my surprise and delight.	There were only some eight or nine left—to whom the Count was explaining, for the twentieth time, how he had had his eye on the children during the last verse of the song; how he had then glanced round the room, to see what effect “de great chest-note” had had upon his audience; and how, when he looked back again, they had both disappeared—when exclamations of dismay began to be heard on all sides, the Count hastily bringing his story to an end to join in the outcry.	They are either vapid or controversial.	“Good night, little ones!” said the Professor.	“Instead of saying ‘_what_ book shall I write?’ an author will ask himself ‘_which_ book shall I write?’ A mere verbal distinction!” Lady Muriel gave me an approving smile.	“_To shelter the sane!_” said Arthur.	And he went to buy some sweeties in a shop.	And the old Sheep said ‘Do you know your A B C yet?	The Professor looked at his watch.	‘Care,’ you know, killed the Cat.	“Three cheers for the Emperor!” The faintest possible sound followed _this_ announcement: and the Chancellor, with admirable presence of mind, instantly proclaimed “A speech from the Emperor!” The Emperor had begun his speech almost before the words were uttered.	There certainly was a sort of witchery of beauty about them.	“Course he knows no better, if he’s Flench!	“It’s difficult to get things started,” the Professor remarked to Bruno.	We would not concern ourselves.	“Then _chorus_ agin!” was shouted out by one of the red-faced men in the window: and forthwith a dozen voices yelled, to a harsh discordant melody, the refrain:—   “There’s him, an’ yo’ an’ me,             Roarin’ laddies!	“I like to think of you as an _old_ friend,” (“—though you don’t look it!” would have been the almost necessary sequence, with any other lady; but she and I seemed to have long passed out of the time when compliments, or any such trivialities, were possible.)	“It has Introductory Verses at the beginning, and at the end.” “It ca’n’t have Introductory Verses at the _end_, can it?” said Sylvie.	“Sylvie!” he said, in a perfectly audible whisper.	“And when it had nubbled _all_ his head off, he went away, and he never said ‘thank you’!” “That were very rude,” said Bruno.	By this time the other guests had arrived; and dinner was announced.	“This must be looked into,” he muttered to himself, taking out a note-book.	Do you know, I think we _began_ as old friends?” she said with a playfulness of tone that ill accorded with the tears that glistened in her eyes.	“That jump would take it at _least_ five miles!	“Who then _are_ these dear children, I pray you?” he said.	Say _that_ took ten times as long (you see we have _unlimited_ time to deal with).	“Something about a duck?” I hazarded.	“No bad news, Sir, I hope?” my landlady said, as she saw me out.	“And, when he had got a little way, he thought he would look into the hamper, and see how the little Foxes were getting on.” “So he opened the door——” said Bruno.	“Is that _all_?” I asked, despondingly.	“I entirely agree with you,” said Lady Muriel: “but don’t orthodox writers condemn that view, as putting Man on the level of the lower animals?	It is a melancholy pleasure to place on record the names of these genuine martyrs—than whom none, surely, are more worthy to be entered on the glory-roll of England’s heroes!	Little Birds are playing       Bagpipes on the shore,       Where the tourists snore:   “Thanks!” they cry.	“I heard it had all come to an end.” “I would like to tell you how it happened,” she said; “as that is the very point I want your advice about.	“Is it Life or Death?” I asked him, as soon as we were far enough from the house for me to speak in ordinary tones.	For instance, if I were to say ‘Here we are!’, that would be accepted without any contradiction, and it’s a nice sort of remark to _begin_ a conversation with.	I asked that foreigner to take her in, because _he’s_ very musical, too.	When the Other Professor had recited this Verse, he went across to the fire-place, and put his head up the chimney.	Who shall stop him?	“‘_The funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage-tables_,’” I could not help repeating to myself.	“About a thousand and four,” said Bruno.	“How many Axioms are you going to give us?	“I don’t like Owls.	Suppose you discover a remedy for some disease hitherto supposed to be incurable.	“It were too tiny,” he repeated.	You needn’t be afraid of _me_!	But no man, in his senses—” (he looked sternly round the table, as if defying contradiction) “—ever yet discussed _WINE_ with a lady!” He sipped his glass of port, leaned back in his chair, and slowly raised it up to his eye, so as to look through it at the lamp.	What they were I could not at all make out, but some mysterious change seemed instantly to pass over us.	“I’m agoan whoam.” “What, withouten thy drink, Willie man?” shouted the others.
