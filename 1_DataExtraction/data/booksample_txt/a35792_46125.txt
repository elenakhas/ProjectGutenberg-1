They made as if to go home because it grew late, and took their leave, charging me to be sure the page should go as privately as might be.	One of the boys cut his hair.	My Journey from Alcalá to Segovia, and what Happened by the way till I came to Rejas, where I lay that Night                                 75 CHAP.	The slain man being discovered to be a person of rank, nearly related to those who had power at Court, Quevedo was forced to fly the country, taking refuge in Sicily, then a dependency of Spain.	Being thus at variance with the old woman, and no way now left to put upon her, I contrived new ways to play my pranks, and fell to that the scholars call snatching and shoplifting, at which sport I had many pleasant adventures.	One asked him for his cloak, another for his girdle; by which I perceived he was such a true friend to his friend, that he had nothing which was his own.	If any unmannerly creature happens to bite us before ladies, we have ways to scratch in public, without being taken notice of; for if it happened to be on the thigh, we tell a story of a soldier we saw had a shot through there, clapping our fingers on the place that itches, and clawing instead of pointing.	and the knaves, that he might not be heard, fell a-singing all together, and rattled their chains.	The simplicity with which the story is told, without those digressions and interruptions to which the Spanish story-teller is so prone, make it a work almost unique among books of the kind.	VII.	He answered, in a great passion, "Learned!	Every now and then I would let fly, "Juan de Madrid!	But in 1554 Mendoza was at the very climax of his public reputation, having just returned from Italy with great credit as Charles V.'s ambassador to the Pope.	Pitiful scoundrel, there are those that receive the holy saints' alms that are fit to be bishops, or for any other dignity; I myself am a graduate of Siguenza."	I and the other servant prayed heartily that God would put it into their hearts to leave something; and when they had devoured every bit, and the curate was picking the bones over again, one of the bullies turned about, and said, "God bless us, we have left nothing for the servants; come hither, gentlemen.	In 1617 he was in Madrid, where he was received with great honour by the King, Philip III., and his minister, the all-powerful Duke of Lerma.	_Of my flight from Segovia, with what Happened to me by the Way to Madrid._ A carrier was setting out that morning with a load from the inn for Madrid.	I told them I would wait on them, if they would give me leave; and left word with the saddler, that in case my pages and footmen came thither, he should send them after me, describing the livery to him; which said, I clapped in between the two gentlemen, and away we went.	We parted them, and inquiring into the cause of the quarrel, the soldier cried, "Put tricks upon me!	There was I informed, that my steed, finding himself in distress, summoned up all the strength he had to salute his enemies with his heels, but was so weak that he put out his hips with the effort, and lay in the mud expiring.	I travelled about a league without meeting anybody, and was considering with myself how difficult a matter it was for me to tread the paths of virtue and honour, since it was requisite, in the first place, that I should hide the scandal of my parents, and then have so much worth myself as to conceal me from their shame.	They favoured me so much that all the boys were envious.	After all this ceremony we came to plain _thee_ and _thou_; and to clench the notion of my quality, already conceived, I went abroad, hired a mule, and muffling myself up in my cloak, and changing my voice, asked for myself, inquiring whether Don Ramiro de Guzman, lord of Valcerado and Vellorete, lived there.	The _picaro_, in fact, is the direct descendant and the legitimate child of the debased knight-errant.	It was dished up in broken platters, and pieces of old crocks and pans, being dressed in a stinking cellar, which was still more plague and confusion to me.	I sold what little I had got underhand, to bear my charges on the way; and with some tricks and sleights of hand, made up about forty crowns, hired a mule, and left my lodging, where I had nothing to leave behind.	In which the Story is continued, with other Incidents  and notable Misfortunes                                             199 CHAP.	There I hit his vein, for he fetched up a deep sigh, and said, "That country has cost me more than it has done the king; for I have been upon a project about these fourteen years, which were it not impracticable, as it is, would have set all right there long ago."	My very teeth were already all furred, and looked as yellow as amber; such a wonderful change had one day wrought.	One of them had a plain badge of knighthood on his breast, the other his hanging at a chain set with diamonds; and therefore, to amuse them, I said I was looking out to buy some choice horses for myself and a kinsman of mine that were to be at some sports on horseback.	After this solemnity they were banished for six years.	But if there have been any more artistic drawings, or engravings of drawings, produced from the time of Dürer or Bellini, Rembrandt or of Piranesi, I have yet to find them, though I have gone in search of them through the chief Museums and Galleries of Europe.	This said, I fell a-weeping; which he perceiving, believed me, looked for the cassock, and seeing it, took pity on me, and said, "Pablo, be on your guard, and take care of yourself, for you have no father or mother to take your part here."	"By my grandame's soul, you don't deserve to be called man since you did not tear his beard for him.	[21] In conclusion, for a small spill of money, he was so much my friend as to prevail with the rest to let me go with them.	Without occupying any more of my space on this subject, it is enough to repeat that the weight of testimony since the days of Nicolas Antonio, the learned and accurate author of the _Bibliotheca Hispana Nova_, to the present time, is in favour of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza as the author of _Lazarillo de Tormes_.	I knew all they said, and sometimes heard it, but did not think fit to make any reply.	However, the fright I was in may excuse my ignorance, especially considering the misfortune came so suddenly upon me.	His estate had been sequestrated, and he was never able to recover more than a small part of it, so that poverty was added, for the first time in his life, to his other trials.	Moreover, as one who had been intended for the priesthood--a calling which he abandoned for soldiership--he could be no friend to the cloth, and was precisely the man to ridicule, as he has done, the abuses of the Church and the vices of the priests, even to caricature the _bulero_ and the hawker of indulgences.	At our coming out of the shop, I remember, I called over one of the pages from the other side of the way, beckoning to him very stately with my hand, and pretending to order him and the rest of them to wait there till I came, but in reality only asked whether he did not belong to my uncle the Commander; he answered me he did not, and so I dismissed him, setting myself off with borrowed feathers.	Do you consider what a thing it is for a man to have a stock of eight hundred thousand songs and ballads by him, and to hear such a decree?	There is no vice in the book, even though it deals exclusively with vicious people.	Don Diego offered his service and begged pardon for the affront of taking me for the barber's son, adding, "Sir, you will scarce believe it, but his mother was a witch, his father a thief, his uncle the hangman, and he himself the wickedest base fellow in the world."	The night we came, he showed us our room, and made us a short speech, which was no longer, out of mere good husbandry.	They gave me two or three prologues to get by heart, and some other grave parts, which suited well with my voice.	The dining-room was as big as a half peck; five gentlemen could eat in it at one table.	This was beautifully done by Gillot (and it is interesting to compare the latter's work of ten years ago with that in this volume done by him to-day), while the printing of Lahure was most careful and satisfactory; but the appearance of Vierge's work in many cases was entirely changed, though he himself knew how it would be changed.	"Daughter to Juan de Madrid?"	He was going up the mountain, with a servant behind him, and an umbrella over his head, much like a rich usurer.	But his four years' imprisonment, during part of which time he had been treated, as he complains, _like a wild beast_ shut up alone without human intercourse, had ruined his health and broken his spirits.	As God would have it, there came two of those creatures that raise money upon their handsome faces to the shop; they were both close veiled, with only one eye bare to see their way, and attended by an old woman and a little page boy.	Through all his changes of character and of costume he is still rogue, entire and perfect, without any sprouts of honesty or repinings after a better life.	With this business and my trade, I have made a shift to maintain your mother as decently as I could."	The soldier compared the rocks to the forts he pretended to have seen, observed what place was strong, and where the cannon might be planted for battery.	That it was composed before 1624 is proved, I think, by the character of the book, which is certainly more juvenile than belongs to a man of forty-six, as well as by a piece of evidence to be found within.	"My back is virgin still," said the swineherd.	Now drink off this quart of wine," said he, "for without you vapour you will not look like a true bully."	My master made me sit next to him, and gave me good marks every day, because I came first and went away last, staying behind to run on some errands for my mistress, and thus I gained all their affections.	She stood as if she had been thunder-struck, and after a while cried, "'Tis true I said so, Pablo, but may I be curs'd if I did it with any ill design.	With this approbation he drew near the poor sleeping old fellow, and slipped a wallet from under his feet, untied it, and took out a box, all the company flocking about, as if it had been lawful prize taken in war.	For this reason he provided a small tin case, all full of holes, like a nutmeg-grater, which he opened, and put in a bit of bacon that filled it; then shutting the box close, hung it with a string in the pot, that some relish of it might come through the holes, and the bacon remain for the next day.	As soon as the friend comes in, we fall into a passion, and cry, 'It is a strange thing that I can never make this maid sweep the room in time.	He was the _conquistador_ out of date--the gold-seeker run to seed.	Thus the farthings came tumbling in by shoals; I got abundance of money, and was in a way of getting much more, had I not been thwarted by an ill-looking lusty young fellow, lame of both arms and with but one leg, who plied my own walks in a wheelbarrow, and picked up more pence than I did, though he begged not half so genteelly; for he had a hoarse voice, which ended in a squeak, and said, "Faithful servants of Jesus Christ, behold how the Lord hath afflicted me for my sins; give one farthing to the poor, God will reward you," and then he added, "for the sweet Jesu's sake."	Some of his works have been lost, but enough remains to testify to the astonishing vigour, exuberance, and versatility of his genius.	To prevent being known by him, he let fall his long hair, which before was tucked up behind his ears, and looked like a shock dog that was never shorn.	The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.	All that one knew was contained in a short note by the publisher: Vierge had been stricken with a grave malady, for some years he disappeared as a working artist.	There is reason to believe that it was written some years before, being probably circulated in manuscript among the author's friends before being printed, as was the custom of the time.	He gave thanks, and said, "Now let us give way to the servants, and go ye use some exercise until two of the clock, lest your dinner do you harm."	It can be executed, for its being impracticable is another matter; and were it not for fear of being troublesome, I would tell you what is; but it will all out; for I design very suddenly to print it, with some other small works of mine, among which I propose to the king two several methods for recovering Ostend.	I gave the same character of her, and so we put upon the whole house.	The better to colour the matter, I fell a-laughing, as if I had not regarded it; but it availed me not, for eight or nine of them standing about me began to grin and laugh out.	"Then he called me Jew," quoth she, "and you could take it so calmly.	and I answered, "I have plenty of stories to tell you, Mr. Licentiate; all that troubles me is, that I must be gone to-night."	"And for my part, ladies," I said, "I had rather have a wife well born, in her smock, than the wealthiest Jew that is; for, God be praised, my patrimony is worth about forty thousand ducats a year; and if I succeed in a law suit, which goes hitherto well on my side, I shall want no more."	what a pedigree I have of his!"	At length, fearing they would really put that villainy in execution, for they had really put cords about my thighs, I made as if I came to myself; yet I was not so quick, but that the rogues being knavishly bent, had whipped the cords about my thighs, and tugged so hard that they sunk them an inch into my flesh.	Some went one way, and some another, and I went directly home from the market place, punishing all the noses I met by the way.	These thoughts seemed to me so honourable, that I congratulated myself on them, and said, "It will be much more honourable in me, who had none to learn virtue from, than in those who had it hereditary from their predecessors."	But it was now two of the clock, and having to travel further, we left Madrid.
