NEW YEAR’S EVE    “I HAVE finished another year,” said God,       “In grey, green, white, and brown;    I have strewn the leaf upon the sod,    Sealed up the worm within the clod,       And let the last sun down.”    “And what’s the good of it?” I said.	“‘I—_failed_!’ escaped him glumly.	From Clock-corner steps, as each quarter ding-dongs,          Away the folk roam    By the “Hart” and Grey’s Bridge into byways and “drongs,”          Or across the ridged loam;    The younger ones shrilling the lately heard songs,       The old saying, “Would we were home.”    The shy-seeming maiden so mute in the fair          Now rattles and talks,    And that one who looked the most swaggering there          Grows sad as she walks,    And she who seemed eaten by cankering care       In statuesque sturdiness stalks.	“Discovery borders near,    And then!	‘But—I _saw_ you—          By the wall,    Half-hid.	Here in the avenue       Raking up leaves,    Lords’ ladies pass in view,       Until one heaves    Sighs at life’s russet hue,       Raking up leaves!

How we cried the day she died!	A yellowing marble, placed there          Tablet-wise,       And two joined hearts enchased there          Meet the eyes;    And reading their twin names we moralize:       Did she, we wonder, follow          Jealously?	II    Who now remembers gay Cremorne,       And all its jaunty jills,    And those wild whirling figures born       Of Jullien’s grand quadrilles?	“Here a day onward, towards the eventide,    Our men were piping to a Pyrrhic dance    Trod by their comrades, when the young women came    To fill their pitchers, as their custom was.

What girl is she who peeps       From the gallery stair,    Smiles palely, redly weeps,    With feverish furtive air    As though not fitly there?

When the summer dawns clearly,    And the appletree-tops seem alight,    Who will undraw the curtain and cheerly    Call out that the morning is bright?

IN CHILDBED       IN the middle of the night    Mother’s spirit came and spoke to me,       Looking weariful and white—    As ’twere untimely news she broke to me.	—“She married yester-morning—only mother yet has known    The secret o’t!” shrilled one small boy.	Thenceforward she shunned me, and languished;       Till one day the park-pool    Embraced her fair form, and extinguished       Her eyes’ living blue.	We shall no more evade       The searching light of the sun,    Our game of passion will be played,          Our dreaming done.	’       “’Twas fixed; no more was spoken          Thereupon;       Our silences were broken          Only on    The petty items of his needs were gone.

Mother said: “She’s a sport-making maiden, my son”;       And a pretty sharp quarrel had we;    O why do you prove by this wrong you have done       That I saw not what mother could see?	.	“Straight pleaded I: ‘Forsooth, Love,          Had I gone,       I must have been in truth, Love,          Mad to don    Such well-known raiment.’  But he still went on       “That he was not mistaken          Nor misled.—       I felt like one forsaken,          Wished me dead,    That he could think thus of the wife he had wed!	“That’s right, my Heart!	“There’s many a heart now mangled,       And waiting its time to go,    Whose tendrils were first entangled       By my sweet viol and bow!” THE HUSBAND’S VIEW    “CAN anything avail    Beldame, for my hid grief?—    Listen: I’ll tell the tale,    It may bring faint relief!—    “I came where I was not known,    In hope to flee my sin;    And walking forth alone    A young man said, ‘Good e’en.’    “In gentle voice and true    He asked to marry me;    ‘You only—only you    Fulfil my dream!’ said he.

Is Death the partner who doth moue       Their wormy chaps and bare?	THE REJECTED MEMBER’S WIFE    WE shall see her no more       On the balcony,    Smiling, while hurt, at the roar       As of surging sea    From the stormy sturdy band       Who have doomed her lord’s cause,    Though she waves her little hand       As it were applause.	I said: How beautiful are these flowers, this wood,    One little bud is far more sweet to me    Than all man’s urban shows; and then I stood    Urging new zest for bird, and bush, and tree;    And strove to feel my nature brought it forth    Of instinct, or no rural maid was I;    But it was vain; for I could not see worth    Enough around to charm a midge or fly,    And mused again on city din and sin,    Longing to madness I might move therein!	.
