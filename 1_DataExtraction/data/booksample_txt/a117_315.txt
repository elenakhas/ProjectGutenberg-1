And shall I miss the biggest?	Picters, statoos, is that why  You should be let off to die?	Soft his pale hands touched them, tenderly caressing;  Soft into his tired eyes came a little light;  Such a wistful love-look, gentle as a blessing;  There amid the flowers waited he the night.	God bless her, that little Fleurette!	Now to fasten it.	_IT SEEMED TO DO JUST THE SAME._ Only a Boche  We brought him in from between the lines:  we'd better have let him lie;  For what's the use of risking one's skin for a _TYKE_ that's going to die?	And I laughed as the silly old bullets came,  For the bullet ain't made wot's got me name.	So back I went with my Boches, as gay as a two-year-old colt,  And it suddenly struck me as rummy, I still was a-humming "Ben Bolt".	.	On the Wire  O God, take the sun from the sky!	You're awful cold and dirty, and a-cursin' of your lot;  You scoff the blushin' 'alf of it, so rich and rippin' 'ot;  It bucks you up like anythink, just seems to touch the spot:   God bless the man that first discovered Tea!	A Song of Winter Weather  It isn't the foe that we fear;  It isn't the bullets that whine;  It isn't the business career  Of a shell, or the bust of a mine;  It isn't the snipers who seek  To nip our young hopes in the bud:  No, it isn't the guns,  And it isn't the Huns--  It's the MUD,                MUD,                     MUD.	The way of the gallant piou-piou,  The dashing and smashing piou-piou;  The way grim and gory that leads us to glory  Is the way of the little piou-piou.	Stand and fight!	'Ow!	what a glorious "do".	)_ Fleurette  (The Wounded Canadian Speaks)  My leg?	"Sorry, sir.

And the rockets like corpse candles hauntit the sky,  And the winds o' destruction went shudderin' by.	.	And there as 'e showed me in triumph, and 'orror was chokin' me breath,  On came another bullet on its 'orrible mission of death;  On through the night it cavorted, seekin' its 'aven of rest,  And it zipped through a crack in the sandbags,    and it wolloped me bang on the breast.	.	Well, _SEARCH THE POTTER'S FIELD._ The Song of the Soldier-born       _Give me the scorn of the stars and a peak defiant;       Wail of the pines and a wind with the shout of a giant;       Night and a trail unknown and a heart reliant._  Give me to live and love in the old, bold fashion;  A soldier's billet at night and a soldier's ration;  A heart that leaps to the fight with a soldier's passion.

He always 'ad tracts in his pocket, the which he would haste to present,  And though the fellers would use them in ways that they never was meant,  I used to read 'em religious, and frequent I've been impressed  By some of them bundles of 'oly dope he carried around in his vest.	The Revelation       _The same old sprint in the morning, boys, to the same old din and smut;       Chained all day to the same old desk, down in the same old rut;       Posting the same old greasy books, catching the same old train:       Oh, how will I manage to stick it all, if I ever get back again?_  We've bidden good-bye to life in a cage, we're finished with pushing a pen;  They're pumping us full of bellicose rage, they're showing us how to be men.	.	The Major puffed his cigarette, amusement in his eye.	Weel, I waited a wee, then I crawled oot masel,  And the big stuff wis gorin' and roarin' around,  And I seemed tae be under the oxter o' hell,  And Creation wis crackin' tae bits by the sound.	There's all kinds of 'owlin' and 'ootin';  It's black as a bucket of tar;  Oh, I'm doin' my bit,  But I'm 'avin' a fit,  And I wish I was 'ome wiv Mar.	Now there's his dog by his empty bed,  And the flute he used to play,  And his favourite bat .	but we carried him in like our own.

Yet still I'm sitting dreaming in the glare and grime;  And once again I'm hearing of them church-bells chime;  And how I wonder whether in the golden summer weather  We will fetch the cows together when it's milking time.	Show you mercy?	You should have seen them:  they'd slipped death's clutches,  But sadder a sight you will rarely find;  One had a leg off and walked on crutches,  The other, a bit of a boy, was blind.	Carry on!	That the tale of my fights will never be ancient story;  That though my eye may be dim and my beard be hoary,  I'll die as a soldier dies on the Field of Glory.	No-o-o."

"So I 'eld 'em back and I yelled wiv fright,  And the boys attacked and we 'ad a fight,  And we 'captured a section o' trench' that night   Which we didn't expect to get;  And they found me there with me Maxim gun,  And I'd laid out a score if I'd laid out one,  And I fainted away when the thing was done,   And I 'aven't got over it yet."	We've finished with trousers of scarlet,  They're giving us breeches of blue,  With a helmet instead of a cap on our head,  Yet still we're the little piou-piou.	"Well, wot abaht it, lad?"
