NILS LYKKE (gravely).	Ay, you are right.	But now you must ride back and join your people.	I had not pictured her thus.	NILS STENSSON.	That is where you must help me.	These?	The Council is now sitting in Copenhagen, considering how best to aim the blow.	And in an hour of terror I have signed away his rights.	ELINA.	LADY INGER (touches her arm).	Suppose, now, I had long purposed to make atonement, as far as might be, where I had sinned.	ELINA.	Hm!	LADY INGER (hesitates).	Peter Kanzler chanced to be on the spot; he took me into his care, brought me up, and taught me the trade of arms.	NOTES.	Damnation!	Farewell.	Oh, no, no!	THE PEASANTS.	LADY INGER.	Your mother keeps me waiting.	Hist, Olaf Skaktavl!	that was the question that was ever ringing in my ears.	THE PEASANTS.	Then we have your leave to----?	LADY INGER.	LADY INGER.	Then she is still awake----     (A thought seems to strike him.)	NILS LYKKE.	NILS LYKKE (approaches him confidentially).	Ah, I have it, I have it!	Since I have learnt this secret, I feel, as it were, older and wiser.	LADY INGER.	An ambuscade that was to snap him up, as soon as you had got the promise that should destroy me!	LADY INGER.	Ah,--this young man is----?	See you not now?	Knights and nobles sang your praise in the feast-hall, and the peasants, far and near, called you the country's pillar and its hope.	In one word, what do you demand?	But to take up arms--to begin open warfare--what would come of that, so long as we are not united?	Nothing.	Truly, there is something in what you say.	He was to bring letters with him, and from them, and from you, I was to learn who he is.	NILS LYKKE.	'Tis not _I_ that am murdering him.	I could do no less.	Be generous--and silent!	All the swords in Norway are rusted.	None could call me to account; yet there lacked not covert threats from Denmark.	ELINA.	Do you fear for your power and your favour with----?	FINN.	Even thus did I ever picture her.	LADY INGER.	Then hear what I have to say--I have sought, so far as lay in my power, to keep you in ignorance of all our griefs and miseries.	So I said to myself: As you are bidden to be in Ostrat to-night, if you have to go through fire and water, you may surely make free to creep through a window.	It sounds well, Elina; Denmark has scarce a nobler name.	He loses the habit of roundabout ways----   ELINA.	You hesitate, lady?	No; not yet.	"I have nurtured him since he was a year old; but up to this day I have ever refused to give him back, trusting to have in him a sure hostage for Inger Gyldenlove's faithfulness to us and to our friends.	Both Olaf Skaktavl and Inger Gyldenlove seem blind to the mistrust 'twill waken, when 'tis rumoured that I am in their league.--Or can Lady Inger have seen through my purpose?	He _is_ here!	Do you but help me with good counsel as long as there is need; when counsel gives place to blows I shall look to myself.	LADY INGER.	No; but it seems she keeps him hidden in one of her own rooms; for----   NILS LYKKE.	On the mother's side too your blood is noble.	You asked what I would with them.	He reached Trondhiem yesterday by a trading ship.	I am----   NILS LYKKE.	OLAF SKAKTAVL.	What mean you by that?	OLAF SKAKTAVL.	But mark well that then our coming had made a stir.	NILS LYKKE.	It is well.	What is it?	NILS LYKKE.	NILS LYKKE.	Mighty voices summoned me to come forth;--yet I dared not.	NILS STENSSON.
