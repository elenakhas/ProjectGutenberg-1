Rosie sat up then, and sniffled.	The doctor's examination was over, but he hesitated and cleared his throat.	Gertrude, who had been standing aloof at a window, turned suddenly.	I was as certain as possible that he did.	I put on my bonnet and sent for what the Casanova liveryman called a "stylish turnout."	Who had made the hole in the trunk-room wall?	Why, at a quarter to three--" "Listen," she said.	Gertrude shuddered.	The night the detective arrived, Saturday, I had a talk with him.	Here was I, Rachel Innes, spinster, a granddaughter of old John Innes of Revolutionary days, a D. A. R., a Colonial Dame, mixed up with a vulgar and revolting crime, and even attempting to hoodwink the law!	"I shan't stir a foot."	There were lights there, streaming cheerfully out on to the trees, and from an upper room came wavering shadows, as if some one with a lamp was moving around.	She got up in her excitement and took hold of my arm.	"The revolver--my revolver--thrown into the tulip bed!"	"Young Walker, down in Casanova, has been attending them.	The evening dragged along slowly.	Her name was Carrington, and the doctor made things pretty strong.	He asked to be shown where Arnold Armstrong's body had been found, and I took him there.	And then Gertrude opened the door, admitting Mr. Jamieson and a stocky, middle-aged man.	Why?"	"Only a couple of weeks."	But when at last we had left the family on the porch and the good doctor was untying our steed, I asked him the same question I had put to Doctor Walker.	I am very sorry for Miss Gertrude.	When she came, however, I could hardly restrain a gasp of surprise.	so that unless a thief was as blind as--as some detectives, he could walk right in."	As soon as they were out of earshot, he turned to me.	And now, can't you see where this thing puts me?	I wake yet and feel myself cold and trembling with the horror of Halsey's situation for three days after his disappearance.	So stop quarreling and be good.	"To the station, Gertrude?	But Gertrude had risen angrily.	"It's the hack, I am sure," she said, evidently relieved.	One day I thought Gertrude knew or at least suspected that Jack had done it; the next I feared that it had been Gertrude herself, that night alone on the circular staircase.	"Good afternoon, Doctor," I said formally.	Gertrude had gone to bed, having been up almost all night, and Halsey was absent on one of those mysterious absences of his that grew more and more frequent as time went on, until it culminated in the event of the night of June the tenth.	She reported a decided coolness in the greeting between Louise and her mother, and that Doctor Walker was there, apparently in charge of the arrangements for the funeral.	This young Doctor Walker--have you any idea why Mr. Innes should have gone there last night?"	"Shall I bring him in?"	But there was nothing to be seen.	As the card went around, I think both the detective and I watched for any possible effect it might have, but, beyond perplexity, there seemed to be none.	He was met by Mr. Jarvis, who took him at once to the east wing.	The window was the same grayish rectangle in the blackness as before.	Was Louise under surveillance?	"I have given you all I would have given my mother, had she lived--my love, my trust.	He took a watch from his pocket and put it on the table.	Mr. Jarvis was called next, but his testimony amounted to little.	"Mrs. Watson went into her room, and found she had gone without her hat.	It was Thomas--Thomas without a mark of injury on him, and dead.	Once in the night I wakened and thought I heard the tapping again.	But Liddy seldom replied to my gibes.	I am a coward--a coward!"	he said.	I asked unceremoniously, ignoring the stranger.	Halsey spent part of the day with Mr. Jamieson, but he said nothing of what happened.	In some way the woman had learned of the substitution, and had tried to use her knowledge for blackmail.	"She is ill, and not able to be moved.	Arnold Armstrong and his father rested side by side in the Casanova churchyard, and at the Zion African Church, on the hill, a new mound marked the last resting-place of poor Thomas.	And I gathered that Mr. Burns, the other detective, had followed a similar car for miles at dawn, only to find it was a touring car on an endurance run.	Mr. Trautman, however, was a shrewd business man, and he did not like the appearance of things.	I might have known."	I have been here one week, during which I have had not a single night of uninterrupted sleep, and I intend to stay until I have recuperated.	He said--he said--'Not so fast, young lady; I want you to let me see what's in that basket.'"	It was an address in fresh ink--             LUCIEN WALLACE, 14 Elm Street, Richfield.	Now, Miss Innes," he said, turning to me, "I must ask you some questions.	The left lung was collapsed, and the exit point of the ball had been found in the muscles of the back to the left of the spinal column.	What did Thomas see in the shadows the night he died?	As to the reason for Louise's flight from California, or why she had not gone to the Fitzhughs', or to some of her people in town, he had no more information than I had.	I have never been a nervous woman, as I said before.	Then she seemed to make up her mind.	I give it as she told it.	I thought, Trude and I thought, we were helping him, but it was the wrong way.	A woman who wished to reach the Country Club, unperceived, might choose such a method.	"Do you know, I believe she is glad, glad!	Halsey and I stood helpless before the storm.	The whole situation was terrible: had the issues been less vital, it would have been absurd.	"Aunt Ray, when I found Jack at the Greenwood Club last Saturday night, he was frantic.	"Miss Rachel!	Isn't that the act of an innocent man?"	The strongest thing against him is his preparation for flight, and his deciding to come back after the murder of Arnold Armstrong.	And then I noticed that Gertrude was limping--not much, but sufficiently to make her progress very slow, and seemingly painful.	Mr. Bailey came down across the lawn, through the hedge, and got into the car on the road."	Where can I find him?"	Barbara Fitzhugh flounced out without waiting to speak to me, but Mr. Harton came up, as I knew he would.
