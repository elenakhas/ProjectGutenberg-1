"Hey, you over by the first-aid kit.	Stan went through Sornal's history, quoting figures and dates from the Personnel files he had read.	Good man sees to it the workers work.	For a large part of his life, he had dreamed of working with them, but he had been unable to find any way of so much as applying for membership in their select group.	"Guy's competent enough at programming, anyway.	His right hand darted up, gripping the outstretched hand before him.	"That was when they nailed me down," he said.	"Wow!"	"Real smart little fella," he added.	Stan looked at the body in consternation.	"Got trouble?"	He talks to the determinators and the joes don't worry you none.	He came closer, then reached out, his hand open.	I went ahead and finished my run.	He looked around, startled.	He jabbed at a sheet with a forefinger.	Again, he punched his palm.	Man, you just don't know how many guys been watching that Vernay."	Stan blinked.	Only maybe he don't like punching keys.	Otherwise, you'll never get a sharp focus and your spray'll make a real mess."	They got to be right."	He commenced rechecking against the print.	"So he's a graduate--who ain't?	You fed him some tea, talked for a while, then left him."	He comes out of the bone-house in a couple days, and he ain't gonna like you at all.	The woman shook her head and returned to her work.	"All right, that's it.	He flipped an index, then punched a combination of numbers on his selector.	Go out, pull a good job, then I lay around, maybe a year and think up another.	Stan grinned tightly and eased off on the knob.	"Yeah."	What sort of man was Vernay, Stan wondered.	"Well, now, perhaps--" Stan looked at him sternly.	Over here."	See what I mean?"	Deftly, Stan swung his toe through a small arc, sweeping Vernay's ankle aside and putting the man off balance.	And for just a flash, he'd really thought of it as a simple possibility.	Turn off that gravito unit.	"Here."	I said we want to see the commander.	Junior machinist.	See what I mean?"	The trouble was, he thought, in the formal way of doing things.	Pete grinned and rubbed his neck again.	Stan reached for his bag of toilet articles.	Delicately, he turned a couple of microdrive dials till the needles settled on their red lines.	It's a sort of preserve we really enjoy at home."	"Don't worry.	You got a good profesh already, know what I mean?"	He pulled another form to him.	"I don't get it," said someone.	For over twenty years, he'd moved around, working in space-yards over the galaxy.	Stan walked through the short corridor, stopping in front of a door.	"Wizow, will you step in here, please?"	And I ain't so dumb I don't know when I'm licked."	Even let you set it up for 'em.	Where'd you learn that stuff anyway?"	His smile faded.	"This is what they pay this guy for.	"Here," Stan told him, "stick this in the test jig and run it."	Marlo waved a hand carelessly.	"I really should spin this thing up to a proof load," he said.	With a startled cry of pain, Vernay spun around and bent toward the ground.	"Sure."	He grinned.	He shook his head slowly.	It focused.	Wonder what he wants."	Give it a little power, too, while you're at it."	Then you can run test on a real piece."	He closed the folder and handed it back to the clerk.	He spread his hands.	He was still a little hazy as to how he'd managed to land in prison on Kell's planet.	"Graham.	Sit down."	He tapped at some notes.	Sornal carefully set the block into an aperture, then reached for a switch.	"Here's trouble.	I do.	"All right, driver," he said peremptorily, "when we get to the Federation Building, swing into the official driveway."	And he'd limped over to file a complaint at the Federation Residency.	Stan examined the tabulated sheets again.
