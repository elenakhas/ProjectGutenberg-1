They had a regular little airtight city, with air-locks and all.	Meanwhile, the young lady kept looking around at us as if we were saints, and telling us we'd done something amazing, and suddenly she broke down and cried.	Inside, he said to me, touching helmets, "If you see something like that again, son, don't tell the others.

Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States.	But there wasn't any light moving around inside them now, or anywhere else.	Pa's voice stopped and his eyes turned to the widening slit and his hand went out until it touched and gripped the handle of the hammer beside him.	So he had to start over and throw the Nest together quick without any advantages, just using any stuff he could lay his hands on.	"It's so small and there's just the four of us.	Pa'd like to seal the whole place, but he can't--building's too earthquake-twisted, and besides he has to leave the chimney open for smoke.	I have to take his word for that, not ever remembering the Sun as being anything more than a big star.	*       *       *       *       * "You know that game we sometimes play, sitting in a square in the Nest, tossing a ball around?	*       *       *       *       * Pa led the way and I took hold of his belt.	So we were all settled around the fire in a wink, and Ma pushed up some cans to thaw for supper, and Pa began.	It's simply impossible."	Neither do I, for that matter, not having to carry the whole responsibility for keeping the human race going, so to speak.	We have to watch sharp not to let the air run low.	You see, I'd just remembered the face I'd thought I'd seen in the window.	1.F.2.	1.F.3.	And two other faces peered over her shoulders--men's faces, white and staring.	In another, a man and woman are huddled together in a bed with heaps of covers over them.	It makes everything else worth while.	And there was a bright light somewhere behind it.	Nursed me and took care of the two of you, too."	He stood for a moment frowning.	The human race is done.	The Earth is done.

I'll be twenty in only ten years.	Now it'll be good to have a real huge world again, the way it was in the beginning."	Pa heard the last radio voices fade away years ago, and had seen some of the last folks die who weren't as lucky or well-protected as us.	Something coming down from the dark star and making the frozen folk move, using them to do its work.	Like a pussy caffay, Pa laughingly says, whatever that is.

When we got back in the Nest and took off our outside clothes, Pa laughed about it all and told them it was nothing and kidded me for having such an imagination, but his words fell flat.	We know that everything is dead out there.	We were all sitting very still.	*** START: FULL LICENSE *** THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at http://gutenberg.org/license).

We've often asked Pa how people acted during that time, whether they were scared or brave or crazy or stunned, or all four, but he's sort of leery of the subject, and he was again tonight.	I'd forgotten about that on account of trying to hide it from the others.	He touched his helmet to mine so we could talk easier and he asked me to point out the windows to him.	That would fit with both things I'd seen--the beautiful young lady and the moving, starlike light.	He nodded and put another piece of coal on the fire.	Funny thing, though--I didn't do much talking at all and Sis hung on to Ma all the time and hid her face when anybody looked at her.	But it didn't wipe away the thing outside from the back of my mind--or the fact that Pa took it seriously.	I sort of wished they'd all quit crowding the Nest and let us be alone and get our feelings straightened out.	I could feel it, too.	Or maybe we will join the pioneers who are going to try to establish a new colony at the uranium mines at Great Slave Lake or in the Congo.	Still, I've got an idea of some of the things that happened from the frozen folk I've seen, a few of them in other rooms in our building, others clustered around the furnaces in the basements where we go for coal.	We started climbing into our outside clothes--mine had been warming by the fire.	As for liquid oxygen, all you had to do was go out and shovel the air blanket at the top _level_.	Why not give up, I asked myself--and all of a sudden I got the answer."	Pa says that all sorts of cliffs and buildings toppled, oceans slopped over, swamps and sandy deserts gave great sliding surges that buried nearby lands.	You see, when the Earth got cold, all the water in the air froze first and made a blanket ten feet thick or so everywhere, and then down on top of that dropped the crystals of frozen air, making another white blanket sixty or seventy feet thick maybe.	There was even the start of a rush to get to a place called China, because people thought the star would hit on the other side.	Even the fire was burning silently.	Pa says there used to be some of that feeling even in the old days, but then every morning the Sun would come and chase it away.	So after they'd got things going smoothly at Los Alamos, which had taken years, they'd decided to make some trips to likely places where there might be other survivors.

She stood there looking at us the strangest way, and she carried something bright and unwinking in her hand.	He didn't convince Ma and Sis any more than he did me.	1.E.7.	Ma quieted down pretty suddenly, though her eyes were still kind of wild as she watched Pa fix on his helmet tight and pick up a pail and the two of us go out.	*       *       *       *       * Well, the strangers are gone, but they're coming back.	That was one of the things Pa had been thinking of when I told him about the light, but I had thought of it myself first and known it wasn't so.	I felt pretty uncomfortable and disturbed myself, even about the young lady.	My skin tightened all over me.	"And it didn't look like stray electricity or crawling liquid or starlight focused by a growing crystal, or anything like that?"	Maybe the Nest will be kept up as what one of the strangers called a "survival school."	Right away Ma got nervous and began making eyes at the entry-slit in the blankets and wringing her hands together--the hand where she'd lost three fingers from frostbite inside the good one, as usual.
