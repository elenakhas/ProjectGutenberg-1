"It is better so.	Never again shall so great a calamity come to mankind anywhere if it be within the Wanderer's power to prevent it.	He came over from New York about a year ago and rented this old house.	Abruptly then, like the turning of a page in some gigantic book, the swift-moving phantasmagoria swung back into the blackness of the infinite and was gone.	"_Will_ be located!	Against the brilliant background of swift color changes and geometric light-shapes that so quickly merged into the familiar blur, Bert saw his companions as dim wraithlike forms.	Bert was properly impressed; the old gleam of the enthusiastic scientist was in Tom's keen eyes.	"See, the gateway," the Wanderer was saying.	You're putting it up to me entirely?"	His placid serenity of countenance had returned, but there was a new eagerness in his intense gaze and his strong fingers trembled while he manipulated the tiny levers and dials.	But I saw...." And then Joan Parker slumped into a high-backed chair that stood in the ancient paneled hall.	"This is a surprise.	Haven't you noticed, man?"	"Not on your life!"	You go on.	The same bowl!	Then the Wanderer continued: "Nevertheless, I roamed these planes as a nonexistent visitor in so far as their peoples were concerned.	Panicky, Bert crossed to her.	"I visited planes where other monsters, as clever and as vicious as the metal ones who devastated Urtraria, were bending every effort of their sciences toward obtaining actual contact with other planes of the fifth dimension.	Some fearful secret must be gnawing at the big man's vitals.	And your friends will be located."	Now they were over the city and the sphere came to rest above a spacious flat roof where there were luxurious gardens and pools, and a small glass-domed observatory.	Joan was white and wan, a mere shadow of her old self.	All was hazy and indistinct outside the sphere that held them, with a rushing blur of dimly gray light-forms.	"We should leave," he said.	The machine of the metal monsters was provided with a huge lens and a reflector, and these were trained on the bowl.	And yet there was this sense of strangeness in his surroundings, a feeling that he had been transported over some nameless gulf of space.	Weapons were in their hands, and a huge engine of warfare like a caterpillar tractor was skimming over the sea from the cliff wall with a great grinding and clanking of its mechanisms.	Roads, stretching endless ribbons of wide metallic surface across the countryside.	They stood in a spherical chamber of silvery metal, Bert and this giant, and the gentle vibration of delicately balanced machinery made itself felt in the structure.	asked Bert, marveling.	A bedlam rose up from the reinforcing hordes as they came in to enter the force area.	Would that there were."	"We go into the past, through eons of time as it is counted in your world."	He stared foolishly at his host, whose eyes glittered strangely in the flickering light.	"It isn't time travel really," explained the Wanderer.	Bert Redmond, his body racked by insupportable tortures, was hurled into the black abyss of infinity....        *       *       *       *       * This was not death nor was it a dream from which he would awaken.	A woman was seated by one of the pools, a beautiful woman with long golden hair that fell in soft profusion over her ivory shoulders and bosom.	There was a sharp click from the control panel and the scene was blotted out by the familiar maze of geometric shapes, the whirling, dancing light-forms that rushed madly past over the vast arch which spanned infinity.	"It is indeed."	Then came the tremendous thump, the swinging of a colossal page across the void, the warping of the very universe about them, the physical torture and the swift rush through Stygian inkiness....	My plane segregator--this sphere--will accomplish this in due season."	It is the beginning of the end of Urtraria--all as it occurred in the dim and distant past."	Then a mound was rising up from the sea near the cliff, a huge tortoiselike shape that stretched forth several flat members which adhered to the vertical white wall is if held by suction disks.	"Where am I?"	"Life--plane--dimensions?"	My friends...." "Have patience, Earthling.	And the man was unheeding, impatient with her demonstrations.	The motors screamed in rising crescendo as their speed increased.	The mysterious intangibilities of the cosmos whirled by unheeded by either as the Wanderer's tale unfolded.	They were mechanical contrivances--the metal monsters of which the Wanderer had spoken.	Long cylindrical things with glistening gray hide, like armor plate and with fearsome heads that reared upward occasionally to reveal the single flaming eye and massive iron jaws each contained.	When reason returned, I set myself to the task of visiting other planes where beings of my own kind might be found and I soon learned that it was impossible to do this in the body.	The illusion of physical nearness was perfect.	Bert, two objects can occupy the same space at the same time, though only one is perceptible to our earthbound senses.	I--I'm sorry."	We can not enter this plane, for there is no gateway.	"Before I let you look," Tom was saying, "I'll give you an idea of it, to prepare you.	"Joan!	Whether their brains were comprised of active living cells or whether they were cold, calculating machines of metallic parts, Bert was never to know.	Here, Bert understood now, the structure of matter was entirely different.	We shall reach there a few seconds after the actual capture."	There came a throbbing of the very air surrounding them, and Bert saw Tom and Joan on the other side of the force area, their white faces indistinct and wavering as if blurred by heat waves rising between.	There was a tremendous thump and the warping of the very universe about them all.	But it's nonsense, Bert, I swear it is.	Swallowing hard, Bert Redmond held her close.	With Joan in one encircling arm he was battling the spider men, driving swift short-arm jabs into their soft bloated bodies with devastating effect.	*       *       *       *       * Raising himself slowly and dazedly from where he had been flung, he saw they were in Tom's laboratory.	"Why torment yourself with such memories?	Guess I'll have to send her to the doctor?"	It was a fetish with him, a past he was in duty bound to revisit time and again, and to mourn over.	"You don't say."	Our normal senses perceive and understand them--length, breadth and thickness.	Bert was surprised that the fastidious older brother should leave his comfortable city quarters and lose himself in this God-forsaken place.	Bert saw that the man hardly glanced in her direction, so intent was he upon an object over which he stood.	Smooth broad lakes, there were, and glistening streams that ran their winding courses through well-kept and productive farmlands.	It was the only object that seemed substantial and fixed in an intangible and madly gyrating universe.	A force area like that used by Tom Parker, an area existent in many planes of the fifth dimension simultaneously, an area where the various components of wave motion merged and became as one.	"Make haste," the Wanderer said.	Within its confines he saw Joan and her brother scuffling with the spider men, tearing at the tentacle arms that encircled them and drew them relentlessly into the basket-weave cage.	Wave-less, glass-smooth, these waters.	"And that--what's that?"	I saw the desolation and the blackness of my once fair land.
