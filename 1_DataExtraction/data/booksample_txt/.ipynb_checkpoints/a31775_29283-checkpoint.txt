That's what Dad and the captain think.	He fought to keep it away; he knew that it would burn through even the insulated fabric of his suit.	"Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.	He clambered back to the rocket, changed the angle of the flaming exhaust, to drive him directly across the path of the object ahead, filled the magazine again with the little pellets of uranite, which were fed automatically into the combustion chamber, and increased the firing rate.	A queer ache came into his heart.	The lanes more frequently used, between Earth, Mars, Venus and Mercury, were of course far inside the orbits of the asteroids.	If only the girl were still living....	Rubbish, of course.	The monster, apparently, had succeeded in killing every man upon the flier, even though some of them had been armed.

The cabins of the navigator, calculator, chief technician, and first officer were empty, and forbidding with the ominous silence of the ship.	No, her face had seemed too calm and peaceful for that.	So, at the end of the long space, he found the treasure.	It was filled with monstrous things, colossal creatures, such as nothing that ever lived upon the Earth; like nothing known in the jungles of Venus or the deserts of Mars, or anything that has been found upon Jupiter's moons.	Thad heard its claws scratching across the door again.	He returned to the rocket, adjusted the angle of the nozzle again, and advanced the firing time slightly, even at the risk of a ruinous explosion.	It must have been a struggle of peculiar violence, to judge by the dark spattered stains, and the indescribable condition of the remnants of clothing.	No wonder the cook was afraid of them.	Nor any other sound.	1.D.	See paragraph 1.E below.	And at first he did not notice the strange odor upon it: a curious, unpleasant scent, earthly, almost fetid, unfamiliar.	For hours he had waited, thinking desperately.	What, then, was the matter?	Reading the diary had made him like her.	Thad whispered.	The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.	He approached the main air-lock, at the center of the hull, behind the projecting dome of the bridge.	For the controls of a modern rocket-flier are so simple and so nearly automatic that a single man at the bridge can keep a vessel upon her course.	But what had he fought?	The mounted creatures he had seen in the hold were evidence that the flier had visited some unknown planet, where weird life reigned.	It vanished from sight in the darkness of space, appeared again against the white, burnished hull of the rocket ship.	Gripping the welding arc, Thad approached the after hatch, giving to the cargo hold.	A metal dome covered it, studded with transparent ports.	*       *       *       *       * Thad opened the exhaust valve, let the air hiss from the chamber of the lock.	The bright, eager eyes were alight with joy.	A terrible choking, strangling sound came from the air.	Then he saw the coffer, lying beyond the piled, gleaming ingots--a huge box, eight feet long; made of some crystal that glittered with snowy whiteness, filled with sparkling, iridescent gleams, and inlaid with strange designs, apparently in vermilion enamel.	"This woman is not dead.	The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work.	Perhaps some deadly gas, from the combustion chambers.... Thad opened the inner valve, and came upon the upper deck of the vessel.	Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!)	Skilfully he judged, from its apparent rate of motion and its slow increase in brilliance, its size and distance from him.	Thad's mass of metal swung on past the ship, as he returned to the rocket and stopped its clattering explosions.	Necessity, however, left him no choice but to seize any chance of learning more of this ship of mystery and her invisible haunter.	The air that struck his face was cool and clean.	But it returned in a sickening wave when he heard the short, shrill, coughing cries, hideously eager, that greeted the opening of the door.	Collected specimens of some alien life.	Invisible claws!	can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.	He breathed deeply, gratefully.	With new anxiety, he measured the relative motion of the gleaming ship.	A long time she looked up at him, first in fearful wonder, then with confidence, and dawning understanding.	The ship then came from the Earth!	*       *       *       *       * For many minutes Thad stood upon the deck, waiting, tensely grasping the welding tool.	Most of the pages were blank.	How had her body come to be in the coffer, he wondered, when all the others were--gone?	A floor ran the full length of the ship, broken with hatches and companionways that gave to the rocket rooms, cargo holds, and quarters for crew and passengers below.	It looked as if it might have been living but minutes before.	Hands quivering, Thad snapped back the hasp, lifted the lid.	He found the life-tubes, six of them, slender, silvery cylinders, lying secure in their niches, three along each side of the flier.	He set the drum on which the wire was wound upon the metal at his feet, fastened it with its magnetic anchor, wondering if it would stand the terrific strain when the wire tightened.	His heart paused, then beat very quickly.	When he had time to think, the invisibility of the thing was not so incredible.	No more time for speculation.	He was carried backward into the room, hurled to the floor.	He realized that the nervous strain and anxiety of waiting was aging him.	The yellow dog seemed half to forget its fear.	He dragged it to the lock through which he had entered the flier, and consigned it to space....        *       *       *       *       * Five days later Thad brought the _Red Dragon_ into the atmosphere of Mars.	Thad thought that the unpleasant earthy odor he had noticed upon opening the face-plate of his helmet was stronger here.	The vessel was plainly a derelict.	He heard the sharp, rending sound, as the tough fabric of his suit was torn, and felt a thin pencil of pain drawn along his body, where a claw cut his skin.	Pondering the significance of those few lines, Thad climbed back to the deck.	Weird forms.	One of them      swears he saw Dad's stuffed specimens moving about in the      hold.	First he ascended the ladder to the bridge.

"Please do not fail me.	What a tragedy her death had been!	The creature's body was so heavy that Thad had to return to the bridge, and shut off the current in the gravity plates along the keel, before he could move it.	Many pages had been torn from the book, and the remainder, soaked with blood, formed a stiff black mass.	No mean prize, that.	Was it a derelict, with all dead upon it?
