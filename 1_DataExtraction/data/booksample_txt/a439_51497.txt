But I stood at my post, with my heart beating, so that the long sword quivered like a candle.	But rudeness is not argument.	To-morrow I will start upon my little errand cheerfully.	Frida de Wichehalse knew for certain, and forever felt it settled, that in all the world of worlds never had been any body, any mind, or even soul, fit to think of twice when once you had beheld Lord Auberley.	My godson would shout all the angels deaf and outdrum all the cherubim.” “Poor little chap!	And we staked half a crown, in a sporting manner, each on his own watch to be the truer by sun upon our way back again.	Wherever have you got to?” leaping on a little rock, I saw a thing that stopped me.	Until then I am your Lordship’s poor and humble     servant,             “AUBYN AUBERLEY.” Lord de Wichehalse made his mind up not to let his daughter know until the following morning what a heavy blow had fallen on her faith and fealty.	But nothing of that sort told at all according to her intention.	At last she was come to a time of life when maidens really must begin to consider their responsibilities--a time when it does matter how the dress sits and what it is made of, and whether the hair is well arranged for dancing in the sunshine and for fluttering in the moonlight; also that the eyes convey not from that roguish nook the heart any betrayal of “hide and seek”; neither must the risk of blushing tremble on perpetual brinks; neither must--but, in a word, ’twas the seventeenth year of a maiden’s life.	I started with terror, and rushed forward, and heard myself called, and saw young Bowring leap up, and stand erect and firm, although with a gesture of horror.	Filled with vain remembrance thus, and counting up the many presents sent to her for this occasion, but remaining safe at home, Frida came to the little coving bower just inside the Point, where she could go no further.	No counter-echo came to me; no ring of any sonorous voice made crag, and precipice, and mountain vocal with the sound of “Bob!” “He must have gone back.	But upon every great occasion there arises a great man; or to put it more accurately, in the present instance, a mighty and distinguished boy.	“I know all that from your picture, uncle.	Among them also was John Pike, a born Zebedee, if ever there was one.	In truth, she was such a charming person that I myself, in a quiet way, had taken a very great fancy to her before George Bowring saw her; but as soon as I found what a desperate state the heart of poor George was reduced to, and came to remember that he was fitted by money to marry, while I was not, it appeared to me my true duty toward the young lady and him, and even myself, to withdraw from the field, and have nothing to say if they set up their horses together.	I am not by any means of that nature.	I looked at her with wonder, suspecting for the moment that the venerable Councillor--who was clever enough to make a cow forget her calf--might have paid her a visit while I was away.	Sylvia, thou shalt come with me.” The man who spoke with this mighty voice was a terror to the others, for they fell away before him, and he was the biggest monster there--Carver Doone, whose name for many a generation shall be used to frighten unruly babes to bed.	There had been in the interval many seasons--or at least I am informed so--of sickness more widely spread, and of death more frequent, if not so sudden.	Suddenly a light form flitted over the rocks, as the shadows flit; and though Frida ran away for fear of interrupting them, they knew who it was, and both, of course, began to think about her.	“Now for another!” the farmer cried, and his deep voice rang above the roar of Lynn; “or two at once, if it suits you better.	Albert de Wichehalse, with a sudden start of intuition, saw what her father had been unable to descry or even dream.	And then I got into a fuzz-rick, and slept all night, for I durstn’t go home to tell Mother Pring.	A LEGEND OF THE WEST COUNTRY.	when the mystery of George Bowring’s death was solved without an effort.	A fine, brave fellow as ever lived, with a short, straight nose and a resolute chin, he touched the measuring-bar quite fairly at seventy-four inches, and turned the scales at fourteen stone and a quarter.	Awaking from a long, long dream--through which I had been working hard, and laying the foundations of a thousand pounds hereafter--I felt the invisible damp of evening settling in the valleys.	“She is not the mistress!” cried Evan Peters, in great excitement, as I thought.	He was up and away upon the mill-stream before breakfast; and the forenoon he devoted to his favourite course--first down the Craddock stream, a very pretty confluent of the Culm, and from its junction, down the pleasant hams, where the river winds toward Uffculme.	He must have been sadly confused by that blow on his heart to think mine so tender, or that this was the way to deal with it, though later explanations proved that Deborah, if she had been just, would have taken the whole reproach upon herself.	The captain could scarcely have seen me, I believe more than half a dozen times to speak of; and generally he had shut his eyes, gentle as they were and beautiful; not only to make me feel less afraid, but to fill me with pity for his weakness.	“I am sorry for it, but it cannot be.	“And I am deeply indebted to your lordship for the grievance; but it must be so.	And here I found him, and we supped at Oxford, and did very well at the Mitre.	And the way in which John found him out was this.	Even so she now was looking at the mounting glory of the sun above the sea-clouds, the sun that lay along the land, and made the distance roll away.	Such things must be happening always, and it seems so unchristian to repine; and if any money has been left them, truly they must attend to it.	“I shall not go near him,” that lad replied, “until I have got a new collar.” No piece of personal adornment was it, without which he would not act, but rather that which now is called the fly-cast, or the gut-cast, or the trace, or what it may be.	I knew that my friend had no gold watch; neither, of course, did I possess one.	The very best girls ever seen are sure to have their failings; and Frida, though one of the very best, was not above all nature.	At that I was so scared that I couldn’t look no more, and the water came bubbling into my mouth, and I thought I was at home along of mother.	“Almost a woman, and a comely one, for those who think of such matters.	In spite of difficulties, dangers, and the pressing need of men, he contrived to send her by some very valiant messengers (none of whom would ride alone) a beautiful portrait of himself, set round with sparkling diamonds; also a necklace of large pearls, as white and pure as the neck whose grace was to enhance their beauty.	Let us fill our pipes and watch the shadows; they do not fall quite to suit me yet.” “How these things make one think,” cried Bowring, as we sat on a stone and smoked, “of the miserable littleness of men like you and me, Bob!” “Speak for yourself, sir,” I said, laughing at his unaccustomed, but by no means novel, reflection.	This is no farmhouse wench, but a lady of birth and breeding.	In her dull, forlorn condition, Frida still, through force of habit or the love of solitude, made her daily round of wood and rock, seashore and moorland.	We trudged along thus at a merry swing, for the freshness of autumnal dew was sparkling in the valley, until we came to a rocky pass, where walking turned to clambering.	And as we laid it upon the grass, reverently and carefully, the face, although it could smile no more, still appeared to wear a smile, as if the new world were its home, and death a mere trouble left far behind.	Thomas Pring was gone, as behooved an ancient warrior, to see how his successors did things, and the boy Dick Hutchings had begged leave to sit in a tree and watch the smoke.	Not that the name is at all a bad one, as among friends and relations, but that, when I am addressed by strangers, “Mr.	What allowance have you made for windage?	Here was a genuine paradise of cats, carefully ministered to and guarded by a maiden lady of Portuguese birth and of advanced maturity.	Ah!	No sooner was lesson done than Pike, whose rod was ready upon the lawn, dashed away always for the river, rushing headlong down the hill, and away to the left through a private yard, where “no thoroughfare” was put up, and a big dog stationed to enforce it.	I remember how hard I tried to get my fingers up to wipe my eyes, so as to obtain some knowledge; but jerk and bump and helpless wonder were all that I could get or take; for my hands were strapped, and my feet likewise, and I seemed like a wave going up and down, without any judgment, upon the open sea.	“You cannot enter this house,” he said in very good English, and by no means rudely.	To his own plain way of judging, and that human instinct which, when highly cultivated, equals that of the weaker dogs, also to his recollection of what used to be expected in the time when he was young, Viscount Auberley did not give perfect satisfaction.	Kind and worthy people scarcely knew the way to look at things.	With men it can scarcely be so cruel; because they can always convince themselves that they did their best; and if it fail, they can throw the fault upon Providence, or bad luck, or something outside their own power.	He behaved very well when he said good-bye,--for I could not deny him that occasion,--and, perhaps, if he had not assured me so much of his everlasting gratitude, I should have felt surer of deserving it.	What of equal purport could the fierce rat-hunter show?	But inasmuch as it has been said by those who should know better, that my father in some way provoked his merciless end by those vile barbarians, I will put into plainest form, without any other change, except from outlandish words, the tale received from Dick Hutchings, the boy, who had seen and heard almost everything while crouching in the water and huddled up inside a bush.	“Did you leave that brave man to be shot?” I asked, as if that were all my gratitude.	“You always tell the truth, my boy, in Latin or in English.” Although it was a long walk, some fourteen miles to Wellington and back, I got permission to go with Pike; and as we crossed the bridge and saw the tree that overhung Crocker’s Hole, I begged him to show me that mighty fish.	Captain Purvis of the Somerset I know not what--for the regiments now be all upside down.	She, however, in her own heart, knew the ups and downs of it.	However, when they tried to make them go, with the help of a good many horses, upon places that had no roads for war, and even no sort of road at all, the difficulty was beyond them.	All this way she thought of pretty little things said to her in the early days of love.	Swift is the flight of Time whenever a man would fain lay hold of him.	All my sentiments at that period ran in Greek senarii; and perhaps it would show how good and lofty boys were in that ancient time, though now they are only rude Solecists, if I were to set these verses down--but, after much consideration, I find it wiser to keep them in.	Therefore, as soon as our Bob had descended into the gray stone-pit, in which his dear father must have breathed his last, I took good care to be out of sight, after observing that he sat down exactly as his father must have sat, except that his attitude, of course, was sad, and his face pale and reproachful.	Even to her father she behaved as if there had been nothing more than happens every day.	Not the interlopers you put up with; but your real master, on whose property you were born.	When the baron at last received the letter which this rider had been so abashed to deliver, slow but lasting wrath began to gather in his gray-lashed eyes.	Haply even you, young maiden, have listened to slander about us.” I told him with some concern, although not caring much for such things now, that I never had any chance of listening to tales about anybody, and was yet without the honour of even knowing who he was.	The sound of the woods was with me now, both night and day, to dwell upon.	“My son, my Bob, my eldest boy!” cried Mistress Pring, jumping up and falling into my arms, like a pillow full of wire, for she insisted upon her figure still.	Therefore Frida was as happy as the day and night are long.	Barwise was then considered the best watchmaker in London, and perhaps in the world.	So, past many a briered rock, and dingle buff with littered fern, green holly copse where lurked the woodcock, and arcades of zigzag oak, Frida kept her bridal robe from spot, or rent, or blemish.	And even sweeter hope was always fluttering in the distance, on the sea, or clouds, or flitting vapour of the morning.
