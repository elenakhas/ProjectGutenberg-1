Forgive this openness, which comes from honest benevolence, and let me greet you                                   "yours truly                                                 Peter Rosegger."	After the three months had past, I moved away from the Münchmeyers, but I stayed in Dresden.	My eyes were burning;  I was all ablaze inside.	He is not allowed to choose the book;  he has to take what he gets.	Even if I had earned nothing for myself, I would have had all I needed to live.	I completed the schedule of my work and then started to carry it out.	Considering these mentally and spiritually so significant, yes even hard, contents of my novels, it would be incomprehensible how they could be described as "literature for young people" and I as an "author for young people", if we would not know that all who commit this mistake have either not understood them or have not read them at all.	Ask her to keep silent about this!"	The manager's wife petted my cheek.	I am going to skip the differences between the Protestant and the Catholic religious services, but to every reasonable person it will be entirely natural and self-evident that I could not participate and even be an active part in the latter for four years, without being influenced by it.	One in every cell and one on every chair in the workshops.	I still had enough of my mental faculties left to open the wardrobe and to change into another, a clean suit.	Going through the list of authors, both men and women, who have written for him, the percentage of those with a criminal record is rather significant.	Unfortunately, father did not possess grandmother's intelligent modesty, nor mother's silent thoughtfulness.	Incessantly, I heard the order inside of me, to seek revenge against human society by violating its laws.	Though he contemplated seeking employment as a minister, he was nonetheless in his heart more a philosopher than a theologian, and tended towards a freer way of thinking.	Nobody else saw and heard it;  no one suspected of what and how terribly I suffered.	It goes without saying that I had to join them!	I possess letters on this topic, written to me by no ordinary person.	[d] Hans von Hunsrück or the Robber-Knight as a Protector of the Poor.	During my entire imprisonment, I have never heard anything about hatching evil plans for the future.	The old, venerable, minister Schmidt made speeches for peace;  and Judge Layritz, too.	She gave her an astonished look, but said nothing.	Her name was Anarchy, and she lived in the deepest forest;  but at night, she came into the towns, to tear down the houses and to burn down the barns;  what a beast!	To work myself up by what is great, beautiful, noble, out of my present deep and low state!	From the companionship of the other prisoners?	This is that I am not the one who has to prove that these indecent passages were not written by me, but rather they will have to prove to me that I am the author.	They read:  "Choose between me and your grandfather;  if you choose him, stay;  if you choose me, come to Dresden right away!"	I guess, this is the right place to clarify a misconception about me from the very start.	And here, the contrasts, which outside intermix like on a plane surface, rise high up like mountains, so that, in this magnification, everything is revealed which would otherwise remain concealed in secrecy.	Recriminations formed within me, but none of the kind which are mere thoughts, like in other people who do not have the same tendencies as I, but recriminations of a much more essential, much more compact kind.	Nobody would think of it!	They were joined by an old, very well known scoundrel, whom nobody may trust, no matter how much flattery he may use;  I am talking about thirst.	I also started to like my work.	What I wanted was something absolutely beyond a common person.	Just now, I started to realize this properly and felt just the more unhappy with this, as I could not talk to a single human being about it, without embarrassing myself.	I rushed to his apartment.	And in all this, there was one contradiction which simply could not be removed.	There it clustered into shapes, which developed arms and legs and eyes and faces and moved inside of me.	If this article really exists, it is more than time for parliament, to put it under a serious examination.	It enveloped me and invaded my soul.	But I met with the greatest resistance, as soon as I rose to even higher paths in my work or in my reading.	The newspapers wrote that I was not in the Orient at all, but that I was hiding, on account of a malignant disease, in the iodine resort Bad Tölz, in upper Bavaria.	The curse on the house took on the form of the following lines: [a] Ludwig Uhland (1787-1862) "The mortgage does await this,   that you, today, shall fall.	I was permitted to go with grandmother.	But I did not allow him to interview me.	In the meantime, at home, my note had been found and read.	I even kept silent, when in Wilhelm Bruhn's magazine "Wahrheit" <Truth> in Berlin, he published a perfectly outrageous assault against me, in which he branded me as an "atavistic criminal", who had been, for almost one decade, in prisons and penitentiaries on account of "continued burglaries"!	[a] Hobble-Frank:  a character from several of Karl May's novels.	There met the teacher Schulze, the principal, the rich man Wetzel, the grocer Thiele, the merchant Vogel, the captain of the rifle-men Lippold, and others for bowling or for playing skat.	There is an attempt to separate the two, to define them sharply, to prove their differences.	He could only help me and testify in my favour, if I would drop this injunction and settle with him.	Quite unexpectedly, I was hereby offered this most outstanding opportunity to get acquainted with printing, typesetting, stereotyping, and everything else which was a part of this, in the most comfortable manner.	He who abuses them, shall not hold me or them responsible, but only himself.	How unlogical!	He has been forbidden to    | | live in a city.	In spite of all opposition, I managed to complete my poem on time.	Once we understood this, the rest was easy.	This equally weird and callous man clapped his hands over his head, as soon as he saw our garden and our beautiful pond, and declared that his cesspool of pestilence and cholera had to disappear at once.	The success of the "Waldröschen" did not just seem to turn out well, but even quite extraordinarily.	During all of this long time until now, he has been their faithful champion; whether he had planed it this way or not, the effect remains the same.	Finally, I received a few lines, in which she told me that she had been to Paris, but nothing further.	Everything I pieced together and tried to build up inside of me, turned out shapeless, ugly, untrue, and unlawful.	"But what does one get out of it?"	To write for the theatre!	Return it to him secretly, but don't let anybody see it now!	Batzendorf had its own council, its own minister, its own administration, but all of this was regarded in a manner which was meant to be humorous.	Not symbolic?	In respect to my mental possessions, I was a squid, which had neither internally nor externally something to hold on to, and therefore also no place to feel at home.	I myself was also faced with such opponents, but I have always seen that our judges never allowed themselves to be influenced by this kind of filth.	That is because he did not just lack the guts to seek a higher position than that of cantor in Ernstthal, but most of all he lacked the permission of his very strict wife Friederike, who had been a prosperous girl and therefore dominated the marriage like a thirty-two foot "principal" [a], while the cantor was only allowed the voice of a soft "vox humana".	And there were moments when I was really convinced that I had received all those slaps, pushes, blows, and head-punches only for the benefit and safety of the king of Saxony and his cabinet!	Stepping out from under the trees, I saw the sky red as blood;  smoke rose up to it.	The wages could only be described as meagre, often even more than meagre.	At that time, I was still much too young, to realize, where this dryness came from.	Hundreds of trashy stories of the most morally corrupting kind have been read by such a boy, and also one volume or several volumes by Karl May.	It was like this:  When I was, at the age of fourteen, a proseminarist in Waldenburg, one day in November, I went from there to Ernstthal to see my parents and to get my laundry.	Now, my plans had to be kept quiet for the time being, but I did not give them up.	But just as much, the behaviour of the lawyer, who had been appointed by the court as my defence attorney, cannot be comprehended.	Everywhere, he found something objectionable.	I felt urged to leave, to go so far, so very far away!	Living in the present times of prosperity, it is almost impossible to imagine how miserably people starved through their days in the end of the 1840s.
