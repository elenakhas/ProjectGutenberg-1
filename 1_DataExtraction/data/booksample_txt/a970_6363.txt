SECOND SERVANT.	All salute thee, fair Senora, Ordnance as their Queen proclaim thee, Beauteous birds as their Aurora, As their Pallas trumpets name thee, And the sweet flowers as their Flora; For Aurora sure thou art, Bright as day that conquers night -- Thine is Flora's peaceful part, Thou art Pallas in thy might, And as Queen thou rul'st my heart.

Being all the world to me, And if birthday it could be, Since my birthday I have known But this desert wild and lone, Where throughout my life's sad course I have lived, a breathing corse, I have moved, a skeleton; And though I address or see Never but one man alone, Who my sorrows all hath known, And through whom have come to me Notions of earth, sky, and sea; And though harrowing thee again, Since thou'lt call me in this den, Monster fit for bestial feasts, I'm a man among wild beasts, And a wild beast amongst men.	.	I say no more.	Therefore there is little need To say how the hapless daughter, Heiress of such scant good luck, Had her own peculiar portion.	There still lives Prince Sigismund, Miserable, poor, in prison.	but what to-day Shall I do in this emergence?-- If I tell my name, Clotaldo, Unto whom I am indebted For my very life and honour, May be with me much offended; Since he said my reparation Must in silence be expected.

She could not advise me better, As the cure of my misfortunes, Than to follow and compel him By prodigious acts of boldness To repay my honour's debt: And that such attempt might cost me Less, my fortune wished that I Should a man's strange dress put on me.	*     *     *     *     * SCENE XIV.

Noble-hearted Sigismund!	Muttering something restlessly, See he lies.	Prince!	See me presently, for I Much must speak upon this business, And for me you much must do For a part will be committed To you in the strangest drama That perhaps the world e'er witnessed.	CLOTALDO.	It will cost thee .	This alone I ponder o'er, My strange mystery to pierce through; Leaving wholly out of view Germs my hapless birthday bore, How have I offended more, That the more you punish me?	-- No need have we to discuss That this fact can really happen, Since, my lord, experience gives us Many a clear and proved example; Certain 'tis that Nature's secrets May by medicine be extracted, And that not an animal, Not a stone, or herb that's planted, But some special quality Doth possess:  for if the malice Of man's heart, a thousand poisons That give death, hath power to examine, Is it then so great a wonder That, their venom being abstracted, If, as death by some is given, Sleep by others is imparted?

See in me One who will this land deliver From a stranger's alien yoke.	By the choice that I have made, Loyal to the land I'll be, I am liberal with thee, And Astolfo's debt is paid; Choose then, nay, let honour, rather, Choose for thee, and for us two, For, by Heaven!	But I call them brave, intrepid, Who go straight unto their end, And ne'er turn their backs in terror:-- By the man who brings them with him Everything may be attempted, Since he need on no occasion Have the fear of being deserted.	More obstinate doth he grow; What course to take, O heavens!	FIRST SOLDIER.	CLOTALDO.
