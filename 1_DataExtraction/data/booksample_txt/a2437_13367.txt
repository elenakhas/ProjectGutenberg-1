But it was easy for me to be happy, since I was on a horse and warm and well fed; yet even for me such days are capricious.	But that is not the place where Roland really died.	They could build, as it-were, with nothing but the last ruins of Rome.	He loves men and eats the things they plant, especially the tender shoots of young trees, wheat, and the choice roots in gardens.	The stars were so pale on the lingering white light of the pure north, the smoky cloud so deep and heavy and steadfast and low above the hills, the fire so near to it, so sharp against it, and so huge, that the awe and sinister meaning of conflagrations dominated the impression of all the scene.	He said to me in answer, "Nothing here is earthly," and after he had said this we both fell into a profound sleep in which we forgot not only cold, great hunger, and fatigue, but our own names and our very souls, and passed, as it were, into a deep bath of forgetfulness.	They carried all her canvas, and cried out to the north-east wind: "We know her better than you!	To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.	Then the seller, saying also "Mr." (for twin brothers rocked in one cradle give each other ceremonious observance here), the seller, I say, admits, as though with reluctance, the strength and beauty of the pig, and falls into deep thought.	We sat and looked at the peaks immeasurably above us, and at the veils of rain between them, and at the black background of the sky.	History, therefore, once a man has begun to know it, becomes a necessary food for the mind, without which it cannot sustain its new dimension.	After that I got aboard.	We in Europe are the healthiest and most normal of our kind.	He bestowed upon them, under his own hand the power not only of remembering all songs, but even of composing light airs of their own; and Pan, who is hairy by nature and a lurking fellow afraid of others, was reconciled to their easy comradeship, and would accompany them into the mountains when they were remote from mankind.	I will consider that I have more perfectly tasted in the mind that which may have been denied to my mere body, and I will produce for myself and others a greater pleasure than any pleasure of the sense.	So set had the surging of the sea become that she rose and fell to it with rhythm, and the helm could be kept quite steady, and the regular splash of the rising bows and the little wisps of foam came in ceaseless exactitude like the marching of men, and in all this one mixed with the life of the sea.	I affirm it.	It comes even to men in cities; men of the stupid political sort, who think in maps and whose interest is in the addition of numbers.	The grass we had mown was but a little over two acres; for that is all the pasture on my little tiny farm.	This path broke up from the kennels near Waltham, and made for the High Wood between Gumber and No Man's Land.	Why was it open thus?	The sea roared over the fore-peak, and gurgled out of the scuppers, and still we held on.	The Spaniards pleaded that Llivia was not a village but a town, and their plea was admitted.	She would point very nearly north, and so I laid her for that course, though that would have taken me right outside the Goodwins, for I knew that the tide was making westerly down the Channel, ebbing away faster and faster, and that, like a man crossing a rapid river in a ferry-boat, I had to point up far above where I wanted to land, which was at Dover, the nearest harbour.	You cannot say where one begins and the other ends.	She will not dissolve by expansion, nor be broken by internal strains.	I mean that the unexpected turning of the ways in such a port is perpetually revealing something new; that the little spaces frame, as it were, each unexpected sight: thus at the end of a street one will catch a patch of the Fens beyond the river, a great moving sail, a cloud, or the sculptured corner of an excellent house.	For the men who make our laws are the same as those that sell us our bricks and our land and our metals; and they make the laws so that rebuilding shall go on: and vile rebuilding too.	Then he did speak, and as he was an honest English gentleman the papers called him ridiculous names and said he had no brains.	For the people of the plain were self-governing; they had no lords.	The peasants sitting about the board and fire had risen, looking at the door; for strangers were rare, and it was very late as I came out of the empty cold into that human room.	They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.	Here, as at Boston, the boats cannot turn round; if they come in frontways they have to go out backwards, like Mevagissey bees: an awkward harbour.	We remembered also--for it was in our common faith--the gross, permanent, and irremediable imperfection of human affairs.	Their style was excellent; their good faith shone even in their style.	There was a legend in the yard where she was built that she drew five feet four, but on a close examination of her (on the third time she was wrecked), I calculated with my companion that she drew little if anything under six feet.	It is still doing so, and I know an old man who can remember a forty-acre field all along by Clymping having been eaten up by the sea; and out along past Rustington there is, about a quarter of a mile from the shore, a rock, called the Church Rock, the remains of a church which quite a little time ago people used for all the ordinary purposes of a church.	I had seen that brick, and picked it loose from an Arab stable on the edge of the Sahara, and I had seen it jutting through moss on the high moors of Northumberland.

Earth, heaped and beaten hard, is the most enduring of things; the tumuli all over England have outlasted even the monoliths, and the great defensive mounds at Norwich and at Oxford are stronger and clearer cut than anything that the Middle Ages have left.	She'll carry away before she capsizes, and she'll burst long before she'll carry away."	I pointed him out where he still lay sleeping.	It is connected with its own country by a neutral road, but it is an island of territory all the same, and the reason that it was so left isolated is very typical of the old regime, with its solemn legal pedantry, which we in England alone preserve in all Western Europe.	This people is not receding--it holds its own, as it deserves to do; but as there are new fields which it has occupied within the present century upon the more western hills, so there are others to the east, and this valley among them, from whence it has disappeared.	The same unbounded power, never at fault and never in calculation, which comprehends all the landscape, and which has made the woods, has worked in each one separate leaf as well; they are inconceivably varied.	MYSELF: It looks to be good land.	At this the gravest and oldest of them, looking as it were far away with his eyes, answered: "By the name of our country and a wholesome terror of the people."	And as to the method of doing this, we may go bicycling (though that is a little flurried) or driving (though that is luxurious and dangerous, because it brings us constantly against servants and flattery); but the best way of all is on foot, where one is a man like any other man, with the sky above one, and the road beneath, and the world on every side, and time to see all.	They had, therefore, vague memories of how the Romans tilled the land.	I said: When would that be?	He digs the point of the scythe hard into the ground with a jerk.	To engrave characters was to cast a spell; and when they seek for some infallible authority upon earth, they can only discover it in the written characters traced in a sacred book.	MYSELF: I mean it seems dry enough.	The outward expression is most manifest, and to pass in and out along the lanes in front of the old houses inspires in one precisely those emotions which are aroused by a human crowd.	Manning was here in his short married life; he lived at Barlton (which foolish men call Barlavington), under the old Downs, where the steep woods make a hollow.	She wandered down the garden paths ruling the flowers upon either side, and receiving as she went autumn and the fruition of her fields; plenitude and completion surrounded her; the benediction of Almighty God must have been upon her, for she was the fulfilment of her world.	There is an art also in the sharpening of a scythe, and it is worth describing carefully.	I, poor and unencumbered, will go and visit these remote places, which have in their time received all the influences of the world, and which yet have no history; for I am tired of this Africa, where so many men are different from me."	Also they see things in the dark and are cognisant of evil.	He chose me out for this favour because I already knew the countryside of the upper Champagne, and had twice seen his city.	The good mower, serene and able, stands as nearly straight as the shape of the scythe will let him, and follows up every stroke closely, moving his left foot forward.	It was not yet two in the morning.	I will not conceal his name.	[Footnote 1: The 22nd of December.]	At one place it invited us to cross, upon two shaking pine trunks, the abyss of a cataract; in another it invited us to climb, in spite of our final weariness, a great barrier of rock that lay between an upper and a lower jasse.	"By what is he controlled?"	But to them it is of no service; for they are too idle to take root in the soil."	They led us into it, down a short steep bit of road, and lined us up by a great basin of sparkling water, and every man was mad to break ranks and drink; but no one dared.	But the principal thing about him was his care for the old wood; and when he rode out to look at it, as I say, he would speak to any one around so early--his bailiff, as might be, or sometimes his agent, or even the foreman of the workshop or the carpenter, or any hedger or ditcher that might be there, and point out bits of the wood, and say, "That branch looks pretty dicky.	For no one can eat or drink the metaphysic, or take any sustenance out of it, and it has no movement or colour, and it does not give one joy or sorrow; one cannot paint it or hear it, and it is too thin to swim about in.	For, in the first place, you lose many hours of work (and those the coolest), and next--which is more important--you lose that great ease and thickness in cutting which comes of the dew.	And as I went still westward, remembering the duties of the land, the sails still held full, the sheets and the weather shrouds still stood taut and straining, and the little clatter of the broken water spoke along the lee rail.	We stood up in the clear and happy light and found that everything was changed.	He saluted me, and, when he had eaten, asked me if I also were familiar with this inn.	*       *       *       *       * Yet I will affirm with the tongue of faith that it is the noblest house of call in the Fens.	THE SEA-WALL OF THE WASH The town of Wisbeach is very like the town of Boston.	And they answered: "Your grace, we commend you to God."	Their God is jealous; he is vengeful; he is (awfully present and real to them!)	And it does more than this.	The rooms in it are so many and so great that the owners of such a bank (having become princes by its success) could inhabit them with a majesty worthy of their new title.	It touched one as does the reiterated note of a chaunt; if not with an impression of doom, at least with that of calamity.
