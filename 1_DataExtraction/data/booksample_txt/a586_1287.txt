What is the fairy's name?--Is't Lily?--Ask not me!	I look after the field work; the house is carefully managed By my father; my mother the hostelry cheers and enlivens.	Who help'd me Against the Titans' insolence?	Though three times and four times they quaff the good cheer The pitchers remain still unemptied.	Oh thou, born among the ruins Spread by great antiquity, On thee rest her spirit!	Is this the vale?	Wito hu!	The rushing water the wilderness covers, Yet Susan's image still o'er it hovers.-- The water sinks, the plains re-appear.	Until at length the full moon, lustre-fraught, Burst thro' the gloom wherein she was enshrined; And then the willing, active, rapid thought Around the past, as round the future twined,               At midnight hour.	* ----- EFFECTS AT A DISTANCE.	Up, still up!	This you appear to understand, for a girl you have chosen As your servant, and that of your parents, who thoroughly good is.	----- ONE PAIR MORE.	MENALCAS.	* ----- ON THE LAKE, [Written on the occasion of Goethe's starting with his friend Passavant on a Swiss Tour.]	See, the archfiend comes, all-glowing!	1765.	----- WELCOME AND FAREWELL.

Yet turn'd I thence, till she had onward pass'd, While closer still the folds to draw I tried,   As though with heat self-kindled to grow warm; But follow'd her.	Ne'er can I be gay!	Sweetly seem'd his eves to laugh Neath his flow'ry chaplet's load; With the drink that brightly glow'd,   He the circle enter'd in.	Decision with speed How to fame to ascend?	----- Is' thou'rt in earnest, no longer delay, but render me happy; Art thou in jest?	Let a funeral pile be straightway dress'd; Open then my cell so sad and drear,   That the flames may give the lovers rest!	And then again To earth descendeth, Changing ever.	Oh, how mysterious Fortune's direction!	Great is my perplexity.	But in thy look, what bitter smart!	oh, what bliss were the night!	Go, tell her straight, and often too, The boy's mute hopes and wishes true.	As now all, yes, all thus moved together,-- Flowers, river, trees, the veil,--all moving,-- And the gentle foot of that most fair one, Can ye think that on my rock I linger'd, Like a rock, as though fast-chain'd and silent?	Smilingly, when she had closed the door, continued the father "What a wonderful race of people are women and children.	----- CAT-PIE.	Stop, for, lo!	I.	Are they hither wending?	* ----- THE SWISS ALPS.

Then with a smile replied the worthy old magistrate, saying "Your reminder is wise, like that which they give to the suff'rer Who has had his dwelling burnt down, that under the ruins, Gold and silver are lying, though melted and cover'd with ashes.	If on rugged hills she wander, If she haste the vale along, Pinions seem to flutter yonder, And the air is fill'd with song; With the glow of youth still playing, Joyous vigour in each limb, One in silence is delaying, She alone 'tis blesses him.	* (+ This oriental belief in the power of the pure to roll-up water into a crystal hail is made the foundation of the Interesting Pariah Legend, that will be found elsewhere amongst the Ballads.)	1815.	Let us in a cunning wise, Yon dull Christian priests surprise With the devil of their talk We'll those very priests confound.	A regal banquet held he In his ancestral ball, In yonder sea-wash'd castle, 'Mongst his great nobles all.	My chamber, the court, and Garden, the beautiful field which spreads itself over the hillside; All appears but a desert to me: I still am unmarried!"	Let me, 'gainst this rocky wall, Neath the elm-tree's shadow, Lay aside my burden, Near thee take my rest.	Remember, ye who live, Though frowns the fleeting day, That to your friends ye give What never will decay.	Alas!	Ay, of a truth, the chain shall indeed be a chain, oh my Dora!	* ----- WARNING.	Both of them came in a friendly manner, and greeted the couple, Taking their seats on the wooden benches under the doorway, Shaking the dust from their feet, their handkerchiefs using to fan them.

Fain the youth would, in his first alarm,   With the veil that o'er her had been spread, With the carpet, shield his love from harm;   But she casts them from her, void of dread,       And with spirit's strength,       In its spectre length,   Lifts her figure slowly from the bed.	Thou art indeed a world, oh Rome; and yet, were Love absent, Then would the world be no world, then would e'en Rome be no Rome.	1803.	Quickly the wise man advanced to the spot, and witness'd the maiden's Silent vexation and tearful eyes and scarce-restrain'd sorrow.	QUICK throbb'd my heart: to norse!	Tell me, then, how best I can win your father and mother."	Amor enter'd in, and found me sitting, And he gently smiled in modest fashion, Smiled as though the foolish one he pitied.	"When that infant vow of love was spoken,   Venus' radiant temple smiled on both.	1815.	Me it astonisheth not,--of the ocean was born Aphrodite,-- Did not a flame, too, proceed from her for us, in her son?	Up!	And the mightiest was Imoski's Cadi, And the woman weeping begg'd her brother: By thy life, my brother, I entreat thee, Let me not another's wife be ever, Lest my heart be broken at the image Of my poor, my dearly-cherish'd children!"	Such actions false will cause no surprise,   Or wonder.	Through the thicket, Turning to the left, Here!	In my confusion I let my hat fall down, and the titt'ring Lasted all the time the singing and playing continued.	Love still closer rivets now their lips,   Tears they mingle with their rapture blest, From his mouth the flame she wildly sips,   Each is with the other's thought possess'd.	As though a flaming cherub bade them move; The unwilling eye the dark road wanders o'er, Backward it looks, but closed it sees the door.	keep ev'ry storm far away!	When at length the sun, in hated splendour.	----- ONCE when I a spider had kill'd, Then methought: wast right or wrong?	Sooner through sadness I'd wish to be slain, Than all the gladness Of life to sustain All the fond yearning That heart feels for heart, Only seems burning To make them both smart.	But inquire of others, and hearken to all that they tell you, When you have learnt enough to satisfy father and mother, Then return to me straight, and we'll settle future proceedings.
