_Dada_ Who are you?	Well, that goes entirely against current opinion.	It is not those who have plunged deep down into the Pundit's _Ocean of Renunciation_, nor those who are always clinging to their possessions; it is not those who have become adepts in turning out quantities of work, nor those who are ever telling the dry beads of duty,--it is not these who win at last.	Do you know the reason?	Who knows what is the hour of the night?	I know about the way; but he knows about the wayfarers.	The same, King.	Why don't you make a trial?	And we shall go on like this to the end.	And it seems to me that I shall find the way, that reaches the land of         lost love beyond the evening stars._ What a strange tune is this, that comes out of the music of Spring.	The beautiful earth!	The little stream that flows past our village comes to my mind.	He lives within the ribs of creation.	These truly win, for they truly surrender.	Ho there, Guard.	If we capture him, then we shall take away your leadership.	How do you know that?	Quite mad!	No, King, that's a lie.	Then let us go.	The wedding festival is being made ready, behind the scene.	Their cry is repeated, I admit, but the reason remains most monotonously the same.	The flowers go, the leaves go, the waves in the river go, and we shall also follow them.	It is a response to the cry of the Universe.	May it please Your Royal Highness, here is Sruti-bhushan, the Pundit, coming back with his _Book of Devotions_.	_Minstrel_ Let me sing, and walk on as I sing, and you follow me.	Come on, then, Dada.	We call them in bird songs,       Beckon them in nodding branches.	Have you got anything ready to hand?	And some say he is dark, like the socket of a skeleton's eye.	But, King, I must tell you before I forget it.	_Oilman_ Black.	What is never-changing, for the river, is the desert sand, where it loses its course.	I was very busy, Your Majesty.	You will undo everything.	As soon as we are started on our way fear will leave us.	Are you still suffering from the quatrain fever?	All we want is to see him.	_Youths_ [_Together._] They come!	I am sure it is our Leader, who has led us astray.	Oh, dear, Poet.	That is my leadership.	Yes, we're queer.	And who else?	It means, that if the bamboos were no better than those noisy instruments---- No, Dada, we must not understand.	Very well.	The sun and stars are drawn in the whirl of rapture._ Now, Ferryman, give us news of the Old Man.	And who are you?	You back out at the very start.	_Watchman_ Our master used to tell us that there are plenty of men to say good things, but very few to listen.	Are _you_ going to read?	_Leader_ And you will become your own elder brothers, pulling your own ears to set yourselves right.	What a good riddance!	We shall never deceive you.	He is the guiding impulse in our life.	No, that can't be.	Why did you not go with him?	No.	_Watchman_ But what do you want?	Your mantle is blown in the wind like the fragrance of the Spring.	_Leader_ You shall let him join in your Spring Festival.	O Sirish, you have cast your perfume-net round our hearts,         Drawing them out in songs._ (_Disclosed among the branches of trees, suddenly lighted up, boys representing champak blossoms._) SONG OF THE BLOSSOMING CHAMPAK    _My shadow dances in your waves, everflowing river,     I, the blossoming champak, stand unmoved on the bank, with my        flower-vigils.	False!"	How can you find out the path by simply singing?	Yet his love rose above all that.	You are there, King.	They have just crossed the waters of pleasure, and are in sight of the land of pure gladness.	You come as a soldier-boy winning life at death's gate,--         Oh, the wonder of it.	Dada, if you use force to make us understand we shall use force to force ourselves not to understand.	Shall I ask the General?	And the Chinese Ambassador?	We Poets call to every one to carry all their joys and sorrows lightly, in a rhythmic measure.	_Chandra_ Again we are found out.	Yes, I, King.	It is they who create, because they know the secret of true joy, which is the secret of detachment.	It seems like the tears of midnight.	He makes us toil for nothing, while he himself remains idle.	For if you stayed out of it, instead of coming into it, then the King would begin to abuse the Poet and send for Sruti-bhushan again.	But whether it is a drama, or a poem, or a play, or a masque, I cannot say.	Let us improve the occasion with good words.	Which way did he go to get there?	My poetry is like the cry of that new-born child.	_Chandra_ You can always find another Dada.
