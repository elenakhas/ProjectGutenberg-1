That's why you're all out here.	The important thing now was to get to know this process.	It was true--he hadn't the faintest notion, really.	She laughed and clapped his shoulder.	You'll go there and, on your first evening, retire early.	Berg turned back to Lancaster.	It's a funny mixture of barium and titanium compounds with some rare earths and--well, read the report for yourself."	"Sleepy time," he said.	Security doesn't like the government's right hand to know what its left is doing."	"Thanks," he grinned wryly.	And you've overcome the fuel problem.	Come, come, now, let's not waste the whole night.	Now that we know how, anybody can make it in his own home--if he's handy at tinkering apparatus together."	True, the equipment was old and cranky, much of it haywired together, much of it invented from scratch.	"Okay, boy, you can pack now.	It was the doctor's voice, and the doctor looked nothing at all like Charon, but still Lancaster wondered if he weren't being ferried over the river of death.	And I think the chance to work independently on something that really interests you will prove every bit as restful to your nerves as a summer's travel.	The voice of Harris had a ripple in it, wavering up and down, up and down.	"Smoke?	"But you said this project was top secret!"	Berg extended a wallet.	"I feel fine," he said.	They aren't hankering to have the Hemispheric Wars back again."	To the entrenched powers and their jackals.	But he didn't dare.	Ici-git, oui, oui, oui,        Ici-git, non, non, non--'"_ Lancaster knew that he had never been really happy before.	The machine should tell you that I'm not doing so out of disloyalty.	"No," said Lancaster.	After all, he was well off.	"That's a shame," he said inadequately.	So the balance struck depends on comparative strength.	He was a successful jackal.	To celebrate."	*       *       *       *       * The interior of the van was roomy, even allowing for the car.	He followed the news, but in a cursory fashion, without troubling to analyze the meaning of it.	His companions--Berg and the one-armed Jessup, who piloted the spaceboat--respected his need for silence.	"We did it!"	So we've got to develop it before the rebels do.	He sighed at last.	"The spaceship's 'way over in Colorado."	Anyway, knowing the orbit of the meteors and that of the _Waikiki_ at the time, he could calculate where the disaster must have taken place--which gave us a lead in searching for the hulk.	He moved his head, feeling the ache of it.	Also, I'm a little suspicious about this man's heart.	"It's not well known today, but the original Manhattan Project that constructed the first atomic bombs had quite an international character," said Berg.	Since you insist, here he is."	Or maybe a simple spot check.	It isn't enough to decide the outcome of a war all by itself, but it may very well be precisely the extra element which will tip the military balance against the government.	"But I'm hot.	If he, a member of the intelligentsia, wasn't sufficiently acquainted with the political and military facts of life to make rational decisions, it certainly behooved the ill-educated masses to obey.	"Go ahead, American," said the man.	"So what?"	The other sat down, whistling tunelessly.	Just tell the truth."	We both have many other things to do."	Secrecy or not, the most competent men on Earth should have been tapped for this job, and they should have been given everything they needed to carry it through.	The station had been painted non-reflecting black, which complicated temperature control but made accidental observation of its existence almost impossible.	"There'll be sun lamps where you're going, my friend.	"Of course, I've no objection at all to your using a lie detector on me."	Just as well that elections had been suspended and bade fair to continue indefinitely in abeyance.	"What's wrong with setting up a world-wide federation of countries?	A table was wheeled forth, bearing the instrument.	Lancaster put his elbows on his knees and rested his forehead on shaking hands.	It was explained to Lancaster that one Dr. Sophoulis had first seen the possibilities and organized the research.	It _increases_ with applied voltage.	I wrote my thesis on the theory of dielectric polarization and since then--no, that's classified."	He assumed Rakkan was somebody's slave--but since when did slaves act as social equals?	Berg introduced the humans casually.	*       *       *       *       * "You probably don't appreciate the hold that kind of argument has on all too many intellectuals--and a lot of the common herd, too," said Berg.	"I still can't tell you anything, not without proper clearance."	"Yes.	None of them quite had the synthesizing mentality needed for an overall picture and a fore-vision of the general direction of work--that had been Sophoulis' share, and was now Lancaster's--but they were all cheerful and skilled where it came to detail work and could often make suggestions in a theoretical line.	Later he was put on a stretcher and carried down endless halls to another cell.	Then, not really knowing why he did it, he lifted a defiant head.	We found it after a lot of investigation, moved it here, and built the station up around it.	"Good.	The station and all its wacky inhabitants.	Berg hadn't lied; this was big!	"There's been some mistake, I tell you," pleaded Lancaster.	Then as war again became an art--well, you see how it goes.	"That's not what I mean, sir," said the doctor.	They ran a few harmless calibrating questions.	They didn't do things like this out in the station.	Lancaster escorted her to her apartment.
