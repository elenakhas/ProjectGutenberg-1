But grudge not, sailor, of driven sand to cast        A handful on my head, that owns no grave.	Their power of condensation naturally recommends them to a writer who has to deal with inconvenient clauses, threatening to swallow up the greater part of a line; but there is no doubt that in the Augustan poets, as compared with the poets of the republic, they are chiefly conspicuous for their absence, and it is equally certain, I think, that a translator of an Augustan poet ought not to suffer them to be a prominent feature of his style.	The commentators seem generally to connect Necessitas with Leti; I have preferred to separate them.	what should man        Think first of doing?	See, narrow-brow'd Lycoris, how she glows        For Cyrus!	On me the Muse has laid her charge to tell        Of your Licymnia's voice, the lustrous hue      Of her bright eye, her heart that beats so well            To mutual passion true:      How nought she does but lends her added grace,        Whether she dance, or join in bantering play,      Or with soft arms the maiden choir embrace            On great Diana's day.	BOOK III, ODE 3.	Black day he chose for planting thee,         Accurst he rear'd thee from the ground,      The bane of children yet to be,        The scandal of the village round.	Your fathers' guilt you still must pay,        Till, Roman, you restore each shrine,      Each temple, mouldering in decay,        And smoke-grimed statue, scarce divine.	Their banks between.	XIX.	Restore, dear chief, the light thou tak'st away:        Ah!	O prompt him still the foe to smite,            The fallen to spare!	DONEC GRATUS ERAM.	Perhaps my translation is not explicit enough.	Who the uneven Muses loves,      Will fire his dizzy brain with three times three;          Three once told the Grace approves;      She with her two bright sisters, gay and free,          Shrinks, as maiden should, from strife:      But I'm for madness.	O, 'tis sweet        To fool, when friends come home again!	The first of March!	BOOK II, ODE 18.	Hedges set round clients' farms      Your avarice tramples; see, the outcasts fly,          Wife and husband, in their arms      Their fathers' gods, their squalid family.	Daughter Pholoe may succeed,      But mother Chloris what she touches mars.	For me, they show in yonder fane          My dripping garments, vow'd            To Him who curbs the main.	What god shall echo's voice repeat        In mocking game      To Helicon's sequester'd shade,        Or Pindus, or on Haemus chill,      Where once the hurrying woods obey'd        The minstrel's will,      Who, by his mother's gift of song,        Held the fleet stream, the rapid breeze,      And led with blandishment along        The listening trees?	Put glory on,        My own Melpomene, by genius won,      And crown me of thy grace with Delphic bay.	JAM PAUCA ARATRO.	but why, my Ligurine,      Steal trickling tear-drops down my wasted cheek?	'Twas wrath that laid Thyestes low;        'Tis wrath that oft destruction calls      On cities, and invites the foe        To drive his plough o'er ruin'd walls.	O headlong Anio!	The interval between the two has been too short to admit of my altering my judgment in any large number of instances; but I have been glad to employ the present opportunity in amending, as I hope, an occasional word or expression, and, in one or two cases, recasting a stanza.	Yes, I may sing the Thyiad crew,        The stream of wine, the sparkling rills      That run with milk, and honey-dew        That from the hollow trunk distils;      And I may sing thy consort's crown,        New set in heaven, and Pentheus' hall      With ruthless ruin thundering down,        And proud Lycurgus' funeral.	Tecmessa's charms enslaved her lord,        Stout Ajax, heir of Telamon;      Atrides, in his pride, adored            The maid he won,      When Troy to Thessaly gave way,        And Hector's all too quick decease      Made Pergamus an easier prey            To wearied Greece.	XIII.	To suffer hardness with good cheer,        In sternest school of warfare bred,      Our youth should learn; let steed and spear        Make him one day the Parthian's dread;      Cold skies, keen perils, brace his life.	Mild thoughts you plant, and joy to see        Mild thoughts take root.	What are great or small?	Why strain so far?	O DIVA, GRATUM.	Achilles' light was quench'd at noon;        A long decay Tithonus minish'd;      My hours, it may be, yet will run          When yours are finish'd.	be sure her sires were great;            She weeps for THEM.	sure to die,      Whether in gloom you spend each year,        Or through long holydays at ease      In grassy nook your spirit cheer        With old Falernian vintages,      Where poplar pale, and pine-tree high        Their hospitable shadows spread      Entwined, and panting waters try        To hurry down their zigzag bed.	BOOK II, ODE 1.	For ease, in wide Aegean caught,        The sailor prays, when clouds are hiding      The moon, nor shines of starlight aught          For seaman's guiding:      For ease the Mede, with quiver gay:        For ease rude Thrace, in battle cruel:      Can purple buy it, Grosphus?	Well, shall I take a toper's part        Of fierce Falernian?	And lords of land      Affect the sea.	To-morrow shall be thine            A kid, whose crescent brow      Is sprouting all for love and victory.	But should any dream of licence, there's a lesson may be read,      How 'twas wine that drove the Centaurs with the Lapithae to fight.	The judge accurst, incontinent,        And stranger dame have dragg'd thee down.	Not such the rule      Of Romulus, and Cato sage,        And all the bearded, good old school.	But mark with what a front of fear        Orion lowers.	then come without delay        And bring your ware: be sure, 'tis not my plan      To let you drain my liquor and not pay,          As might some wealthy man.	Who can talk of want or warfare when the wine is in his head,      Not of thee, good father Bacchus, and of Venus fair and bright?	Our guest,      Megilla's brother.	SOLVITUR ACRIS HIEMS.	Let the Capitolian fane,      The favour'd goal of yon vociferous crowd,          Aye, or let the nearest main      Receive our gold, our jewels rich and proud:          Slay we thus the cause of crime,      If yet we would repent and choose the good:          Ours the task to take in time      This baleful lust, and crush it in the bud.	Quintilius dies;        By none than you, my Virgil, trulier wept:      Devout in vain, you chide the faithless skies,          Asking your loan ill-kept.	The gales of Thrace, that hush the unquiet sea,        Spring's comrades, on the bellying canvas blow:      Clogg'd earth and brawling streams alike are free          From winter's weight of snow.	But it would, I think, be a mistake to attempt to get rid of this monotony by calling in the aid of that variety of images and forms of language which modern poetry presents.	Whether 'twas Libra saw me born        Or angry Scorpio, lord malign      Of natal hour, or Capricorn,        The tyrant of the western brine,      Our planets sure with concord strange        Are blended.	Jove's favour is their guiding star,      And watchful potencies unweave        For them the tangled paths of war.	The case is really one of those noticed in the Preface, where an interpretation which would not commend itself to a commentator may be adopted by a poetical translator simply as a free rendering.	XVII.	Sometimes, where the general effect of two views of the construction of a passage has been the same, I have followed that which I believed to be less correct, for reasons of convenience.	at length appear,      A cloud round thy bright shoulders thrown,                Apollo seer!	Alcides too shall be my theme,        And Leda's twins, for horses be,      He famed for boxing; soon as gleam        Their stars at sea,      The lash'd spray trickles from the steep,        The wind sinks down, the storm-cloud flies,      The threatening billow on the deep        Obedient lies.	It is this, indeed, which constitutes the grand difficulty of the translator, who may well despair when he undertakes to reproduce beauties depending on expression by a process in which expression is sure to be sacrificed.	You by Jove's blest power      Were snatch'd from out the baleful range        Of Saturn, and the evil hour      Was stay'd, when rapturous benches full        Three times the auspicious thunder peal'd;      Me the curst trunk, that smote my skull,        Had slain; but Faunus, strong to shield      The friends of Mercury, check'd the blow        In mid descent.	DELICTA MAJORUM.	L.     I love my own fond lover,      Young Calais, son of Thurian Ornytus:              For him I'd die twice over,      Would Fate but spare the sweet survivor thus.	and all the while I thrill      With jealous pangs I cannot, cannot check.	Let him smile in triumph gay,      True heart, victorious over lavish hand,          By the Alban lake that day      'Neath citron roof all marble shalt thou stand:          Incense there and fragrant spice      With odorous fumes thy nostrils shall salute;          Blended notes thine ear entice,      The lyre, the pipe, the Berecyntine flute:          Graceful youths and maidens bright      Shall twice a day thy tuneful praise resound,          While their feet, so fair and white,      In Salian measure three times beat the ground.	While I had power to bless you,        Nor any round that neck his arms did fling              More privileged to caress you,      Happier was Horace than the Persian king.	Ay, Venus smiles; the pure nymphs smile,        And Cupid, tyrant-lord of hearts,      Sharpening on bloody stone the while            His fiery darts.	TE MARIS ET TERRA.	Fish feel the narrowing of the main        From sunken piles, while on the strand      Contractors with their busy train        Let down huge stones, and lords of land      Affect the sea: but fierce Alarm        Can clamber to the master's side:      Black Cares can up the galley swarm,        And close behind the horseman ride.	Our Hercules, they told us, Rome,        Had sought the laurel Death bestows:      Now Glory brings him conqueror home            From Spaniard foes.	It would indeed be a satisfaction to me to think that the question of translating Horace had been brought a step nearer to its solution by the experiment which I again venture to submit to the public.	I have taken feminis with divides, but it is quite possible that Orelli may be right in constructing it with grata.	O, 'twas a gallant sight to see        The shocks that beat upon the brave      Who chose to perish and be free!	Begin the mournful stave,      Melpomene, to whom the Sire of all          Sweet voice with music gave.	Not large my cups, nor rich my cheer,          This Sabine wine, which erst I seal'd,      That day the applauding theatre          Your welcome peal'd,      Dear knight Maecenas!	to my comrades true        Rich cups, rare bronzes, gladly would I send:      Choice tripods from Olympia on each friend        Would I confer, choicer on none than you,      Had but my fate such gems of art bestow'd        As cunning Scopas or Parrhasius wrought,        This with the brush, that with the chisel taught      To image now a mortal, now a god.	Some of my predecessors seem hardly to distinguish between the Lyciae dumeta and the natalem silvam of Delos, Apollo's attachment to both of which warrants the two titles Delius et Patareus.	Guardian of hill and woodland, Maid,        Who to young wives in childbirth's hour      Thrice call'd, vouchsafest sovereign aid,            O three-form'd power!
