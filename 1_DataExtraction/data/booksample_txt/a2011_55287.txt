ELLEN           Come back, lass.	Hae ye made the bed?	POLLY           Naw, ye’ll no’.	[The door from the bedroom has been           opening slowly, and Mary listens.	MARY           Why did ye no’ shout on us frae yer           room?	MARY           Naw.	MARY           It’s a wee sherp this mornin’ too.	A tell’t ye A’d gie ye yer           answer the nicht an’ ye’ll huv tae wait           till the nicht fur it.	MARY           Aye, an’ huv ye gaun aboot tellin’           everybody that aw ye hud tae dae wis           whistle an’ A rushed intae yer airms.	MARY           Oh, why did ye no’ tell me at first?	Naw, we musnae dae           that.	He tak’s a pride in           bein’ at the pithead regular for the           first cage gaun doon; he’d be rare an’           mad wi’ me if A brung him back fur           naethin’.	A wis only a wee lassie           then, bit ma mither had nae mair sense           nor tae let me oot tae the pit—heid tae           see the bodies brung up.	MARY           (puzzled by her appearance, decides to           be consoling) Weel, A’m sorry ye left           yer bed fur naethin’, before the room’s           aired tae.	A must go.	POLLY           It’s a handy thing tae huv aboot the           hoose.	Ye’ve never           tell’t me hoo it happen’t.	A’m no’ gaun back.	POLLY           But it’s a comfort tae think he’ll no’           be burnt.	Come an’ sit quiet, ravin’ aboot as if           ye were mad.	Ye’ll stay whaur ye           are.	We ken           naethin’ yit, an’ if we did, greetin’           ‘ll no’ mend it.	ELLEN           Come in, wull ye?	JOCK           (as he opens the door slowly, morn has           broken fully, and a hard grey light           enters the room)           A’ll be hame pretty quick so ye’ll           better be ready.	(She rises from her           chair.)	POLLY           Aye.	Look at the clock.	JOCK           Rats wur busy at it yesterday whin A           cam’ to pit my pick doon an look fur ma           dinner.	There wis mair than twinty kill’t that           time an’ mebbe forty or mair that wis           hurt.	It wis only a fancy.	It           tak’s mair than a year or twa tae git           intae the wey o’ pits when ye’re born           strange tae them.	A’d best shut the door, tac, an’           keep oot the row or she’ll be wantin’           tae go.	ELLEN           Only an auld wife’s fancy, lass.	JOCK           (tasting)Aye.	It’s a thing ye cannae forget.	ELLEN           There’ll be plenty fills o’ wimmen there           seein’ whit’s up and keepin’ the men           frae their wark, withoot you gaun an’           helpin’ them tae dae it.	ELLEN           Aye.	MARY           Why no’?	ELLEN           D’ye think A don’t love him, lassie?	Goes weel wi’ a cup o’ tea,           tae, on a cauld mornin’.	ELLEN           (as she takes a coarse white cloth from           a drawer, spreads it and proceeds to lay           breakfast.)	JOCK           It’s wi’ thinkin’ o’ you, lass.	Ye sit there quiet an’ calm as if           there wis naethin’ the maitter.	We’ll hae tae keep her           mind aff it.	Look here, lass, if ye cannae           talk o’ naethin’ bit accidents, ye’d           better shut up.	ELLEN           Mine’s is in’t.	MARY           A dream?	ELLEN           Aye.	ELLEN           Naw.	Bless the lass, whit’s the use o’           that!	Mary, left alone, begins to           tidy up and prepare the house for the           use of the day.	The doctors were there           afore A come away, and ambulance men tae           wi’ aw they’ll need.	MARY           Bit whit can we dae?	ELLEN           Oh aye, he’s a good lad.	ELLEN           A’ll be ready.	ELLEN           Ye’d better dae it then.	MARY           A cannae wait, A must ken.	Ye never ken, Mary,           what’ll happen doon a pit.	Can ye mind o’ onything           else we micht want?	[Mary goes to the bedroom again.	MARY           Yes, auntie.	Rushin’ oot tae the pit-heid ‘ll dae ‘im           nae guid.	Eh, it micht a’           been yesterday.	Seems as if it wis only the ither day A           heard the bell ringin’ an’ saw ma man           brung up.	Come tae           mention’t, it’s a funny thing.	MARY           Fur——           ELLEN           Hoo dae A ken whit fur?	Get the           kettle filled.	ELLEN           Look here, lass, A tell’t ye ye widnae           go, an’ A’ve made sure o’t.	A wisnae long o’ askin’ ye           whin it wis.           MARY           Then ye’ll jist hae tae wait till mine           is med up.	A mind the day when the           pit wis on fire.	But ye’ll jist huv tae pit up           wi’t.	There’s           wimmen keepin’ hoose in the places the           coal goes that pay fur their coal wi’           brass.	Aye, the           nichtmare’s no pleasant fur ony yin.	ELLEN           A didnae think o’ that.	Whaur are ye gaun, lass?	MARY           Let me go tae him.	ELLEN           Naw, ye’ll no’.	That’s richt.	JOCK           A’ richt.	A don’t mind o’ hearin’           the alarm bell ringin’ mair than yince,           or mebbe twict since yer uncle wis           kill’t.	MARY           Aw richt, auntie.	MARY           Mebbe no’.	ELLEN           (quietly and slowly bending her head as           if to a physical blow)           God’s wull be dune.
