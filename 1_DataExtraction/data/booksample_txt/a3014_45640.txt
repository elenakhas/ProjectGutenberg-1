A romance of most uncommon sincerity."	Another objection lodging-house keepers have to women lodgers is that when they begin a quarrel they are so long in bringing it to an end, especially if under the influence of drink.	Manchester Jack, being active and business-like, could call at three times more houses than a man that was afflicted by age or accident.	Of course, these callers do not matter much to the true beggar, for he goes blindly to work, careless of his surroundings; but the timid beginner, who looks to the right and left of him, before and behind, is very apt to pass on if a neighbourhood is not kept more quiet for his work.	Beggars, however good-natured they may be in a lodging-house, are all selfish on this one point.	Although I have met several men and women that could claim to being born beggars, having been born of beggars on the road, yet for all that, people must not think that this is quite common.	As I was not an old traveller in England, I did not understand him, but thought I would find out for myself what a "nark" really was.	Yes, when I was about to call at a house for my dinner, the Baltimore Kid suddenly clutched my shoulders, and said impressively: "Whatever you do, do not address that woman as Lady, but call her Madam, or Mrs." Just to humour the Kid, for I thought such advice was ridiculous, I addressed the lady as Madam, and explained my needs.	Then there is the razor-man, with his very cheap razors, which look so very good.	He was always heard to be humming a tune--often an old familiar hymn--so that it could not have been mental worry that fastened his skin so tight to his bones.	Day after day I thought of the lovely tall lady; and it was not her height, grace, or beauty, nor her wealth and social position that were uppermost in my thoughts--but that she had written a book!	But when I exposed such articles at the camp, before the eyes of other beggars, I always took the credit on myself for having begged them, for fear of Brum's scorn.	I cannot now read with enjoyment books that are borrowed or are likely to be wanted back.	The "nark" is either a cattle-drover, a small hawker, a mechanic that only has a couple of days' work a week, or a man that earns a few pennies by doing odd jobs for people that know him.	He asked me then if I would write a few lines to his mother if anything serious happened to him.	He is only too glad to perform these tasks at every opportunity, but the true English beggar is a Briton that never will be a slave.	Now, sometimes a very common pair of glasses will suit better than costly ones for which the eyes were tested; even as a brass watch may keep better time than a gold one, or a pair of ready-made boots fit better than a pair made to order.	Now a beggar knows that if he asks at a house point-blank for money, nothing will he get; or, occasionally a woman will say, "I will give you something to eat."	Sometimes--more often than not--it is only dry bread; and they offer it to a beggar who perhaps has better food in his pockets.	I then asked him the size of the town, but this he did not know, for he had never been there, but came very near going there a year ago.	They are suspicious of him, in spite of his good-natured offers to oblige them with a shake of pepper.	The following day I received a letter with a postal order for twenty shillings.	But the man to whom this kind of life properly belongs is the American tramp.	I may as well say here what kind of begging the man was doing at this time of his life, which became known to me after, for I had his company for several days.	It quite upset Pat to think that he had been induced to go first, so he made up his mind that Tim should share his misfortune.	Another time I went to a small cottage, and the door was answered by a very shabby-looking old lady.	Seeing nothing unusual in this, I said, "What's the matter?"

On one occasion I had the pleasure of hearing Irish Molly speak her mind to a landlord who begrudged coke for the kitchen fire, making it necessary for lodgers to bring in pieces of wood, picked up in the streets.	In this case he cannot continue begging--which he must, or go into the workhouse--so he throws the food away and continues to beg more of it, in the hope of getting money for his bed.	This invitation he would accept only on one condition--that I would then have another with him.	Hearing this, I could do no other than take him to the lodging-house where I lived.	Leaving him I went in quest of a fourpenny lodging-house in the East End, and soon found one.	"'Cinders' has too much sense for that," said "Red-Nosed Scotty," who happened to be sitting near.	When I arrived in London, I had a gold sovereign and a few shillings; and, being full of hope, like all young people, went to a small hotel, had a good meal, and paid two shillings and sixpence for my bed.	Sometimes he carries a few laces, pins, and needles, etc., so as to get a few coppers at places where spectacles would not be needed.	We must approach this man very seriously, for he is forced to beg through a terrible affliction.	It never occurred to his suspicious mind that one potato had become small in the extra boiling, and we three strangers had to tolerate his savage looks.	But, unfortunately, this life was too good to last long, for something happened the following day that not only put an end to my ball-playing, but forced me to leave the green common.	The first day I arrived I happened to find a green, open space where I could lie down and take my ease between meals.	People do not know that he enters as a beggar, not as a customer, and that he often gets tipsy because beer is often easier to beg than bread or pennies.	XXV Narks A man cannot be a very long time on the road before he understands the meaning of the word "narks."	These beggars generally ask a workman, when they see him with his food-tin, if he has anything left from dinner.	While the meeting was going on, several members not only went from house to house, but even begged passers-by--aye, even came to me and my seedy friend.	I lifted the glass of water slowly to my lips, so slowly that the lady had heard my remark, weighed it for a second, and then promised a cup of tea, before my lips had touched the water.	I am quite used to these things now, and take little notice of them, regarding them indeed as peculiar to the house of Fame.	Houses _are_ marked, but in nine cases out of ten children are the guilty ones.	mark you, when this true beggar is earning ale and money!	Of course, our workhouses are not hotels, neither are they rough boarding camps, so that the ratepayers are, after supporting them, far from being relieved, seeing that this tramp is forced to make personal application for more food, or starve.	Thanking her I left, and at the first opportunity sat down to examine the contents.	On their deep-sea boats they get hard biscuits, salt meat, dried peas, and cheap molasses; but on the lakes they get soft bread, fresh meat, green vegetables, and luxurious fruit.	Few of the lodgers took any notice of him, until he came to one that had on a silk hat and a frock-coat.	How it pleased my Uncle T---- to hear this, who is himself a good beggar, but confines himself to Wales, with an occasional trip to an adjoining county.	Owing to this I could never feel comfortable, for if I happened to look up from my book and saw the librarian looking my way, I always thought that he was weighing in his mind what manner of man I was.	All eyes turned towards him, and who do you think Algernon Dudley was?	Yet this man "Cinders" had been seen on several occasions walking the streets with a woman on his arm.	he shouted; "didn't I see you playing ball with the children all day yesterday, only a few yards from here?	It did me no harm at all, for I was soon on my feet and going to his assistance.	And what do you think this Cockney had the impudence to say to Brum?	In fact I made a special journey to Toronto for that very purpose, but was petted and spoilt by the many good people in that town.	I think now of that memorable morning in America, when Brum, an excellent beggar, saw a lady kiss a horse.	If I had been living in London during these last two years, my books would now run into several hundreds, and I would not have spent five pounds.	Now, if a man or woman gave such a beggar this dry bread, he would most likely receive it with indifference and cold thanks, and throw it away, being none too particular in carrying it beyond the eyes of the giver.	Ah!	When he is once at the bar, he seldom leaves it till the house closes at night.	This paper parcel had kept him for three years, but he had missed it several times.	In the winter this man spent all his days on one particular seat, when he could get it, and as near to it as possible when it was already taken.	One night, when I was at the office paying for my bed, I heard a man come in at the front door and stand behind me, but did not turn my head, thinking that he was one of the many lodgers that lived there.	I was in the lodging-house kitchen one night when "Brummy" Sam brought a married friend of his to see me.	It is generally in public-houses where the razor-man succeeds.	"Why don't you go to bed?"	Not many days after this the big, healthy schemer had to walk out for his living, and had heavy tasks put before him, which he was well able to perform.	In about half an hour I had several pennies over my bed money, also a quantity of food, so I thought I would get a newspaper and return to the lodging-house, and take it easy for the rest of the day.	But this musician knew well what the houses were, for he had been to them before and--in a whisper--these almshouses were almost his best pitch.	To understand my good fortune people must know that Saturday morning is the worst time in the week for a beggar.	Although he whispered this information, it was quite loud enough for Alf to hear, and the big fellow looked at Sam with gratitude.	I earn three, four, and sometimes five dollars a day at my trade, and am the main support of a family of little sisters and brothers.	In fact, he would be the first to explain his business, whether he was there first or not.	One day an old lady gave me half a chicken and a sponge cake, with the information that she was getting parish relief.	_Athenaeum._        *       *       *       *       *   H. W. Nevinson's New Book   ESSAYS IN FREEDOM "The author is one of our best prose writers with a magnificent nervous force and reserve, a true and natural stylist.	Half the tramps in America will not ride a train if they cannot get the comfort of an empty car--not even on a road where the brakesmen are good and indifferent as to the number of tramps they carry.	XII American and English Beggars A man that has camped out much in the open air must always after be on the look-out for places suitable for camps.
