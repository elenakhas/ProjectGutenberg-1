thought I, what sorrow art thou like to have for thy portion in this world!	But yet could not be content, unless I was found in the exercise of my gift, unto which also I was greatly animated, not only by the continual desires of the godly, but also by that saying of _Paul_ to the _Corinthians_: _I beseech you_, _brethren_ (_ye know the household of Stephanas_, _that it is the first fruits of Achaia_, _and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints_) _that ye submit yourselves unto such_, _and to every one that helpeth with us_, _and laboureth_.	now, how was my soul led from truth to truth by God!	236.	I would then add to these men’s sins, the sins of _Manasseh_; how that he built altars for idols in the house of the Lord; he also observed times, used enchantments, had to do with wizards, was a wizard, had his familiar spirits, burned his children in the fire in sacrifice to devils, and made the streets of _Jerusalem_ run down with the blood of innocents.	I cannot now express what then I saw and felt of the steadiness of Jesus Christ, the rock of man’s salvation: What was done, could not be undone, added to, nor altered.	But, saith he, you must submit to the laws of the land, and leave off those meetings which you was wont to have; for the statute-law is directly against it; and I am sent to you by the justices to tell you that they do intend to prosecute the law against you if you submit not.	I found myself as on a miry bog, that shook if I did but stir, and was, as there, left both of God and Christ, and the Spirit, and all good things.	iii.	38, 39.	that the work of man’s redemption was yet to be done by Christ!	This man made it much his business to deliver the people of God from all those false and unsound tests, that by nature we are prone to.	To which one made me some answer: but my jailor pulling me away to be gone, I could not tell what he said.	127.	And again, I did look upon it as my duty to do as much good as I could, not only in my trade, but also in communicating to all people wheresoever I came the best knowledge I had in the Word.	257.	172.	That also was an help unto me, _Because I live_, _ye shall live also_.	192.	I remember that one day, as I was travelling into the country, and musing on the wickedness and blasphemy of my heart, and considering the enmity that was in me to God, that scripture came into my mind, _Having made peace through the blood of His cross_.	272.	So as I was going home, these words came again into my thoughts; and I well remember, as they came in, I said thus in my heart, _What shall I get by thinking on these two words_?	_Fost._  He said that I was ignorant, and did not understand the Scriptures; for how, said he, can you understand them when you know not the original Greek?	* * * * * WHEN I had lain in prison other twelve weeks, and now not knowing what they intended to do with me, upon the third of April 1661, comes Mr Cobb unto me (as he told me), being sent by the justices to admonish me; and demand of me submittance to the church of England, etc.	145.	Thus He served me, and that justly, for I should have believed His word, and not have put an _if_ upon the all-seeingness of God.	168.	Matt.	This did sweetly revive my spirit, and help me to hope in God; which when I had with comfort mused on a while, that word fell with great weight upon my mind, _O death_, _where is thy sting_?	It may be you are not, said the Tempter; it may be so indeed, thought I.	_Secondly_, It was a public and open action, even before his brother, if not before many more; this made his sin of a far more heinous nature than otherwise it would have been.	Saith he, I come to tell you, that it is desired you would submit yourself to the laws of the land, or else at the next sessions it will go worse with you, even to be sent away out of the nation, or else worse than that.	_Fost._  He said, To have any such meetings was against the law; and, therefore, he would have me leave off, and say, I would call the people no more together.	This was a good day to me; I hope I shall never forget it.	136.	Having thus in a few words given you a taste of the sorrow and affliction that my soul went under, by the guilt and terror that this my wicked thought did lay me under; and having given you also a touch of my deliverance therefrom, and of the sweet and blessed comfort that I met with afterwards, which comfort dwelt about a twelvemonth with my heart, to my unspeakable admiration: I will now (God willing), before I proceed any farther, give you in a word or two, what, as I conceive, was the cause of this temptation; and also after that, what advantage, at the last, it became unto my soul.	_Bun._  I said, Because I did not find it commanded in the Word of God.	But of particulars here, I intend nothing; only this methinks I must let fall before all men—I do prefer this book of _Martin Luther_ upon the _Galatians_ (excepting the Holy Bible) before all the books that ever I had seen, as most fit for a wounded conscience.	19, 20.	So one day I walked to a neighbouring town, and sate down upon a settle in the street, and fell into a very deep pause about the most fearful state my sin had brought me to; and after long musing, I lifted up I sat my head, but methought I saw, as if the sun that shineth in the heavens did grudge to give light; and as if the very stones in the street, and tiles upon the houses, did bend themselves against me.	3.	80.	306.	255.	That Christ Jesus, as crucified, and dying sixteen hundred years ago, did not satisfy divine justice for the sins of the people.	Thus was my soul at this time (and as I then did think for ever) set at liberty from being afflicted with my former guilt and amazement.	5.	16, and the Spirit that stirreth up in our hearts desires to come to God, for such things as we stand in need of, Matt.	_children are an heritage of the Lord_; _and the fruit of the womb is His reward_.—_As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man_, _so are children of the youth_.	I thought verily I was the man that must enter, because I had smitten my neighbour _unwittingly_, _and hated Him not aforetime_.	* * * * * _The Substance of some Discourse had between the Clerk of the Peace and myself_; _when he came to admonish me_, _according to the tenor of that Law_, _by which I was in prison_.	37.	Gen. xxx.	Now I thought, _surely I am possessed of the devil_: at other times, again, I thought I should be bereft of my wits; for instead of lauding and magnifying God the Lord, with others, if I have but heard Him spoken of, presently some most horrible blasphemous thought or other would bolt out of my heart against Him; so that whether I did think that God was, or again did think there was no such thing, no love, nor peace, nor gracious disposition could I feel within me.	_Fost._  He said, Which of the Scriptures do you understand literally?	167.	_Bun._  Yes, Sir, said I, I think I should not be forbid to do as much good as I can.	Hebrew x.)	_A wounded spirit who can bear_!	’Tis to no boot, said he.	When this was read, the clerk of the sessions said unto me, What say you to this?	I saw in this condition I was as a man who was pulling down his house upon the head of his wife and children; yet, thought I, I must do it, I must do it: and now I thought on those _two milch kine that were to carry the ark of God into another country_, _and to leave their calves behind them_.	Oh!	6; _Fox’s Acts_ and _Mon._ 271.	Heb.	Before I came to prison, I saw what was coming, and had especially two considerations warm upon my heart; the first was, how to be able to encounter death, should that be here my portion.	_Bun._  I thank you, Sir, said I, very well, blessed be the Lord.	I never saw those heights and depths in grace, and love, and mercy, as I saw after this temptation; great sins to draw out great grace; and where guilt is most terrible and fierce, there the mercy of God in Christ, when showed to the soul, appears most high and mighty.	_Oh_!	Heb.	_Bun._  That practice of theirs, I abhor, said I; yet it doth not follow that, because they did so, therefore all others will do so.	I could neither hear Him, nor see Him, nor feel Him, nor favour any of His things; I was driven as with a tempest, my heart would be unclean, and the _Canaanites_ would dwell in the land.	267.	2 Sam.	1 Cor.	xii.	5.	xii.	183.	Something also there was upon my heart at the same time, which I cannot now call to mind, which, with this text, did sweeten my heart, and make me conclude, that His mercy might not be quite gone, nor clean gone for ever.	After this, I found by reading the word, that those that must be glorified with Christ in another world _must be called by Him here_; called to the partaking of a share in His word and righteousness, and to the comforts and first-fruits of His Spirit; and to a peculiar interest in all those heavenly things, which do indeed prepare the soul for that rest, and house of glory, which is in heaven above.	as He in whom all these, and all His other virtues, relations, offices and operations met together, and that He sat on the right hand of God in heaven.	Their company alone, I cannot away with; I seldom so much as touch a woman’s hand; for I think these things are not so becoming me.
