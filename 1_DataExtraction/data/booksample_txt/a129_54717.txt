They reached at last the place where now the mighty walls   And newly rising citadel of Carthage stand.	See the swarthy Memnon’s arms,   And that fierce maid, who, clad in gleaming armor, dares   To lead her Amazons and mingle in the fray.	We had a king, Æneas, more than peer   Of all in justice, piety, and warrior’s might.	I fear this Tyrian hospitality;   For well I know their faithless hearts and lying tongues.	Meanwhile, by that same prophet warned, did they   This wooden image fashion to appease   Th’ offended goddess, and atonement make   To her outraged divinity.	When foemen strive,   Who questions aught of trickery or might?	He throws down his bow in disgust, and points in the direction of the hunt with a gesture of impatience.	Corœbus, though the odds are overwhelmingly against him, rushes in to save his beloved Cassandra.	Can it be that under wintry skies   Thou wouldest launch thy fleet and urge thy onward way   Mid stormy blasts across the sea, O cruel one?	_Venus_ (594-620):   What grief inflames thee to this boundless wrath?	_Hector_, with deep sighs and groans (289-295):                           Oh, get thee hence,   Thou son of Venus, flee these deadly flames.	_Æneas_, overwhelmed with astonishment, aside (281-294):   O Jove, and I had near forgot my destiny,   To oblivion lulled amid the sweets of this fair land!	Then cease to vex thyself and me with these complaints;   ‘T is not of mine own will I fare to Italy.	renown’d in every clime   Through the long records of succeeding time;   Who saw protecting gods from heaven descend   Full oft, thy royal bulwarks to defend.	ACT II.	Her face assumes an expression of cunning.	Then fare thee on, and follow where the path of fate   May lead.	Ilioneus kneels before her; she extends the scepter, which he touches.	But how   From this benumbing passion shall I free myself?	The servants hastily finish their work.	Barce comes tremblingly to her.	In the foreground are two great moss-grown rocks, on one of which sits Cupid, draped with garlands of wild flowers, shooting his arrows at a heart-shaped target hung from the branches of a tree in the center of the stage.	The mighty glory of the Trojan state   Is of the past, and we, alas, no more   May call ourselves of Ilium; for lo,   The cruel gods have given all to Greece,   And foemen lord it in our blazing town;   The great horse stands upon our citadel,   And from his roomy side pours armed men;   While Sinon, gloating o’er his victory,   With blazing torch is busy everywhere.	Enter a band of Greeks led by Ajax, the Atridæ, and others, dragging Cassandra roughly along by the hair.	O fatherland!	My fame   O’erleaps the stars.	_Cassandra_:   O fatherland!	Thus arrayed, they mingle with the parties of Greeks who straggle in, and slay them.	He hurls his spear, which sticks fast in the wooden horse and stands quivering there.	Anna sits in the foreground, spinning.	Did he one sympathetic sigh of sorrow heave?	ASCANIUS, son of Æneas and Creüsa (silent).	The Trojans are moved to tears by this tale of woe; and Priam bids the chains be stricken from him.	Then, I confess it, did I break my bonds.	May the gods   A fitting gift bestow upon thee; if indeed   They feel a true regard for pious souls, if e’er   The truth and conscious virtue aught avail.	So Calchas bade.	Through the columns there is a view (1) out over the moonlit sea.	The Carthaginians are more elaborately and richly dressed than in the first scene.	Æneas and Achates, meantime, are greatly agitated by her words.	Music is heard in the distance, flutes and zithers leading a chorus.	Dido, who has stood with averted face and scornful look, now turns upon him, in a passion of grief and rage.	Shall I forsake my kingdom and accompany   The joyful sailors, or with all my Tyrian bands   Around me, follow in pursuit and force again   My friends upon the deep and bid them spread their sails,   My comrades whom with pain I weaned from Sidon’s halls?	Come hither then;   These sacred altar stairs shall shield us all,   Or in their sight will we together die.	Then comes the Ithacan with clamor loud,   The prophet Calchas dragging in our midst,   And bids with charge insistent that he tell   The will of heaven.	But whensoe’er they addressed them to the sea,   Rough wintry blasts and storms affrighted them.	For if Minerva’s gift   Should by your hands be desecrated, then   Would dreadful doom (Heaven send it on _their_ heads)   Upon old Priam and his Phrygians come;   But if within your walls this sacred horse   Should by your voluntary hands be set,   Then would all Asia rise with one accord,   And sweep in mighty war against the Greeks,   And that dire doom upon our grandsons fall.	No, within this horse   The crafty Greeks are lying even now,   Or else its towering bulk has been contrived   To give them spying place upon our homes,   Or chance to scale our city’s battlements.	The vessels float, the swelling sails salute the breeze,   And now the sailors crown the sterns with festive wreaths!	Be man of ours.	They kneel upon the steps and Anna advances to the altar.	Dido, during this speech, has gone to her husband’s shrine.	I fled from death and in the sedgy reeds   Along the muddy margin of a lake   All night I lay in hiding, hoping there   To lurk until their homeward sails were spread.	Thou seest all is well.	Re-enter Trojans led by Æneas.	In battle order stand the long drawn lines   Of gleaming steel prepared for deadly strife.	When she can no longer see her in the gathering twilight, she turns with a sigh to her chamber.	Anna, hastily putting aside her work, goes to her sister, whose face is buried in her hands.	As the storm increases, the courtiers flee across the scene in every direction.	_Priam_, springing up and facing Pyrrhus (535-543):   For that base crime of thine, that impious deed,   I pray the gods, if there are gods in heaven   Who care for men, to grant thee dire return,   And give thee what thou hast so richly earned.

Across the stage at the first wing a low, broad marble wall (1), forming one end of a colonnade which leads back to an arch (2), through which the distant sea is visible (3).	Through the trees growing along the summit of this cliff, comes the shimmer of the distant sea.	To such an one I liken yonder queen.	Anna is asleep on a couch in the foreground.	For, in this pregnant crisis of affairs, be sure   She will be active.	Now Tyrian Dido holds him, and with fawning words   Delays his course; and much do I distrust and fear   The shelter which our envious rival Juno gives.	Whence these wounds   And horrid scars I see?	She dismisses with a gesture all except old Barce, who approaches her mistress.	And soon, and suddenly, the sea retraced,   Will they be here again.	_Æneas_, aside (515-521):                                       Nay, not so, for still   Our fortune in the balance hangs.	Now hear thy part:   Obedient to the summons of his doting sire,   The youthful prince Ascanius goes to Dido’s town   With gifts which Ocean and the flames of Troy have spared;   Him, lapped in sleep, will I to far Cythera bear,   Or hide him in my sacred fane on Ida’s top,   Lest he should know what we intend, and thwart our plans.	He makes as if to give the sacred images to Æneas, and vanishes.

They gaze at each other in silence.	But now to thee she trusts her sacred gods   And all their sacred rites; take these with thee   As comrades of thy fates; seek walls for these,   Which, when the mighty deep thou hast o’ercome,   Thou shalt at length in lasting empire set.	Lo, to thy hand   Is cause of dalliance, while still the blustering winds   Of winter sweep the sea, Orion’s storms prevail,   Their fleet is shattered, and the frowning heavens lower.	My Hector’s corpse he gave for burial   And sent me back in safety to my home.	_Æneas_ (469-478):   And here behold the ill-starred Rhesus’ white-winged tents,   Where fierce Tydides slays his sleeping foe; and drives   Those snowy steeds to join the Grecian camp, before   They graze in Trojan meadows or the Xanthus drink.
