Don Diego beckoned two guards, who immediately drew near their prisoner.	The noble candour in his eyes almost dazzled the stedfast, doubting gaze of Elizabeth.	He declared his ancient and inexorable hatred of Wharton and his politics; he boasted that the transaction to which the Duke de Richelieu was privy, had been one of mutual vengeance; that he quarrelled with Wharton at the Cardinal's table, and the same night took his revenge with the sword.	He remained some time, like a pillar transfixed in the earth, after the Duke had disappeared.	3 OF 4 *** ***** This file should be named 46637.txt or 46637.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:         http://www.gutenberg.org/4/6/6/3/46637/ Produced by Beth Baran and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images generously made available by The Internet Archive) Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.	Marcella did not follow her in, but sunk into a seat, near the door of the chamber.	Their agents were indefatigable and subtle; and as they were various, and apparently insignificant, the work moved onward as surely as invisibly, to the object of its aim.

He gazed on it in a strange tumult of mind.	General Stanhope then repeated to him, all that the impassioned resentment of Ripperda had excited him to avow.	"With the woman you scorn.	Wharton laughed.	Wharton went in with his companions.	The secret wishes of half the nobility in Spain, were also unfolded to him by the envy of de Patinos; and the venality of Orendayn was at his service.	Several sentinels drew around the vehicle, with demands whence it came, and what was the object of the persons it contained.	The moon was now full upon them, and Martini putting out his head a little from the wall distinctly saw the musket and waving feather of the soldier as he walked to and fro at his post.	He clenched the letter against his bursting heart, and fell back in the seat.	If it were, I should starve in this generation."	He inclosed it under a cover to the Marquis Santa Cruz, who had a villa in the neighbourhood.	cried she, "had you been true, those words, that voice, would have been evidence to out-weigh a multitude.	"You must be my prisoner, Marquis," returned the warden, "until those men have searched the neighbourhood.	Her own discretion seconded his plea; and when she approached him again, it was with a gracious countenance, and to say that his petition should be considered with indulgence.	In many of these parties, Louis met Duke Wharton; but he never staid more than a few minutes, though those few were hailed by an adulation that might have detained a prouder spirit.	Though his portmanteau had been brought to him, the writing materials and money it contained, were taken out in his presence, and even his books of devotion shared the same fate.	The charges were to be supported at Madrid, by a powerful majority of grandees; and should the scheme go on, there could be no doubt of the impeachment of Ripperda under a cloud of false witnesses; and most probably, the perpetration of some iniquitous sentence against his life.	Here he is not.	Lorenzo glided in also; and at the very moment in which the deputy had pressed before Louis, to announce to the sleeping Ripperda, the arrival of his son, the page's eye fell on a letter which lay on the table.	A triangle encases my heart," continued he, with one of his wonted smiles; "and you have one of its sides."	When Spain sees me again, it will not be as a benefactor."	"No;" replied Louis, with a wan and wintery smile; "nothing that you would propose."	It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.	He was her counsellor, her friend.	This we have done!	Can you pardon and receive him again to your heart?"	He directed the brief letter to the Marquis de Montemar, and left it on the table.	The falling dew, and the howling wind raised him not from that bed of lonely despair.	This desertion from his party, incensed de Patinos the more; and a lurid fire burnt in his angry eye, whenever it encountered his admired rival.	Her beautiful eyes swam, like sapphire gems in the summer dew.	Is this the alternative I expected to hear from the lips of my only friend, in this fearful extremity of my fate!"	He walked on, and thought of the rapt liberty of the soul in the sweet serenities of beautiful solitude.	England proclaimed a rough indignation at the demand for Gibraltar, which Austria had made in behalf of Spain.	said she, "Do not you think so, Duke?"	But attributing her displeasure, to a suspicion that he had wrought on his father to influence the Queen to prevent his marriage, after the momentary shock of his, first surprise, he calmly and respectfully answered her;--"that he was as faithful to all his bonds, made under the sanction of Her Majesty, as he believed, were the dictates of his father's heart.	"It shall be my corpse!"	My father, then    full of life and enterprize, went to the old Count Sinzendorff's.	CHAP.	But a noise of approaching steps, withdrawing his attention for a moment from his guard, a desperate lunge from the infuriate arm of his adversary, ran him through the breast, and he fell.	The door was opened; and the deputy stood back, while the son of the Duke entered the vestibule of the prison.	She accosted him with wonder at his early flight.	"Thy ensign may light me back to this castle in a different garb from that in which I leave it!	She was pale as himself; and did not look up while she addressed him.	"It will not do!"	"Fortune favours me!"	On arriving there, the Ambassador was from home; but Ripperda did not hesitate to assume the rights of hospitality at the house of the representative of a sovereign, to whose legal accession to the throne of England, he had obtained the acknowledgement of half Europe.	The Duke continued.	And are such arguments yours?	Ripperda desired that the person might be told, it was not his custom to admit strangers to his presence, and never to suffer dictation in the manner he was to receive them.	"Madam," exclaimed he, "I am now a ruined man!	Impressed with the deepest gratitude, Louis confided to his disinterested friend, the whole contents of the packet he had left in the care of the Marchioness.	"But," added Louis, with a smothered sigh; "in the august ceremony of next week, I conjure Your Majesty not to command me to be proxy!"	The Marchioness observed a brilliant flush shoot over the face of her auditor, as he bowed his head to her last words.

Wharton pressed his hand.	I have written to    her, and to Mrs. Coningsby; and she is perfectly free: every bond is    relinquished, but that of the heart.	When that sun arose, which, he believed, was to set on him a completed wretch, he turned from its beams with a loathing sense of what his vain credulity and headlong passion had brought upon him; a joyless youth, an old age of desolation!	There would then be no need of a window in the bosom, to understand how each man might be stimulated or restrained.	"And so," added the smiling ecclesiastic, "I doubt not, he seeks to revenge the triumphant magnanimity of his transcendant rival."	1.B.	"Yes;" rejoined the ambassador, "he made a shew of rescuing the Duke de Ripperda from the fury of the populace; but it was only to betray him to the ministry.	"I see you anticipate what I have to tell you," said the Duke.	The Duke owned, that as circumstances were, there was a necessity for the marriage; or, at least, an appearance of preparing for its celebration.	Whether in its public or private circumstances, all bore the marks of universal excommunication.	"There are virtues for every season of life; and I thought you had been made sensible that it is the privilege of manhood to make all nature subservient to his interest and his pleasure.	"Had I sought a subterfuge," replied he, "I should have merited the utmost of Your Majesty's disdain; but from the first moment that I found myself too sensible to her charms, I struggled against the disclosure; and when circumstances extorted the confession from me, with the declaration of my love, I also declared that I was not at my own disposal.	XIV.	The Cardinal feared Ripperda; and flattered himself, that he might work upon the zeal and good-nature of Wharton, to serve the interest of His Holiness by this concession.	Merciless men!"

During this defence, the Empress frequently shook her head; and when it was finished, she rose from her chair.	Louis grasped the hand of his friend.--"Oh, Wharton!	The Duke was now insensible, from a blow he had received on the temple, in the scuffle.
