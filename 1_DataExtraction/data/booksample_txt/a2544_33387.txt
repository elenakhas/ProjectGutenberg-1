"Are you ready?"	I myself was Father Neptune, with a toasting-fork for a trident, and as we paraded round the nursery, pelting each other with pieces of torn-up paper for confetti, I think we rivalled in noise the wildest carnival I had ever witnessed at San Carlos.	"Looks much too comfortable!"	"Knight and squire and dame are there       Priests beside the altar wait,     Frets and fumes the bridegroom fair.	"Are there any other changes?"	"Wind up the lines, and we'll row back to the jetty and land her.	"But I think after such a list of good omens the weather could hardly, for shame, disappoint us, though I can't give the English climate much of a character, after all."	ho!"	Millicent hustled me into the pink costume, and twisted the gold ornaments into my hair with nervous fingers.	"She's burning the midnight oil.	It was perhaps only natural after all that my new life should in some measure erase the old one from my mind; it was what my father had desired, and if I were beginning to think that England was far more to me than the country I had left, he would be the first to rejoice over my altered views.	"Catherine and Philippa have done well, but we must not turn their heads by overpraising them.	Fired by an article in a boys' magazine, he once volunteered to stuff a dead bullfinch which Cathy had found in the garden, and after a long operation of skinning and drying, he produced it in the school-room with great pride.	"Then draw up the curtain, and begin."	"You've no right to say so!"	My aunt was inclined to take the same view, and when on further inquiries it was found that Mrs. Marshall was equally highly thought of in other quarters, and that Mrs. Winstanley's only daughter Catherine was already a pupil at the school, the question was considered settled.	If I could have bidden the company leave the room, I think I might have acquitted myself better, but to discourse sweet strains with Mrs. Marshall's eye upon me, my music-mistress sitting close by, and an audience of critical school-mates listening, was an ordeal from which many a girl might shrink.	We waited rather anxiously for further developments, and they were not long in coming.	I heard her tell Mrs. Marshall afterwards that she had rarely met a more intelligent girl, and she thought I should make an ideal clergyman's wife!"	"I see the roof of the arbour has fallen in," said Cathy, as we wandered round on a tour of exploration after breakfast the first morning.	Perhaps of all our expeditions I enjoyed our walks the most.	said Dick, somewhat mollified.	I whispered to Cathy, feeling just a little compunction when I heard the old man's cough.	Flocks of plovers scared at our approach flew off with warning cries, and a sea-gull or two, which had been feeding with them, flapped majestically away towards the silvery line of the sea in the far distance.	"We're not half quits yet," returned George grimly.	He kissed Lucy and Mary and my dear Cathy, who was nearly crying for joy, and had a hearty hand-shake for each of my companions.	"There is!	My aunt, I am sure, did her very best for me according to her lights, and perhaps she thought that I should settle all the sooner if I were left judiciously alone, but, looking back now upon her upbringing, I think she might have shown me more tenderness.	"Um!	Cathy generally carried out her intentions, so one afternoon about a week later she came from the tool-house carrying two small garden spades in her hand.	"Tell us again about San Carlos, and the forest, and the tree-witches, and the gri-gri man," said Edgar and Mary, who listened spell-bound to my reminiscences of Tasso's marvellous stories; and I would sit in the dusk by the nursery fire, with an audience of eager little faces around me, putting such horrible realism into my narratives that Donald brought Blair from her supper by screaming that the gri-gri man was under his bed, while poor Mary never dared in future to pass the lumber-room door, for fear of seeing a grinning goblin pop his head suddenly out of the darkness.	Why shouldn't we have a sham burglar, and rouse them all in the middle of the night?	Cathy's letter was a product of genius.	"Yes," she said slowly, "you have your father's eyes, but otherwise you're the image of your mother: the same slight build, and the same light hair and colour which I remember so well in my poor sister-in-law.	He likes birds' eggs, too, but such a dreadful accident happened last holidays that he'll have to begin all over again."	I wrote regularly to my father.	I shall certainly try some day, when I have time."	"Don't make any noise, and perhaps we may be able to catch him.	I had been so successful in the elocution class, that many of the girls would have been willing to include me, but Ernestine Salt, who seemed no more friendly towards me than before, had always exerted her influence very strongly against it, and as she was an older girl than myself, and had also been longer in the school, she was able to carry her point.	I was more than willing, so we started briskly up the steep stony road towards the moors.	The mound proved to be a small green hillock in the corner of a very stony field close to the bridge.	I echoed.	She had no favourites, but I think that Cathy and I, as being more interested than the others in the botany and natural history, which were her special subjects, came in for an extra share of her affection, and I know we both worshipped her with that depth of devotion which school-girls are ever ready to offer to a teacher whom they really respect and love.	"My broom's too busy sweepin' floors, miss, to be used for anything else."	Let us go up that path through the glen that led on to the moors."	Would you like to see it?"	We all have to play, whether we want to or not.	"Oh, I hope you'll be able to remember the part!	We tried our honest best to be pleasant little hostesses, and the visitors were indulgent, but I often think we must have afforded them much amusement by our "improving conversation".	This time they did not take Cathy and me into their confidence beforehand, though from various dark hints we imagined they must have some scheme of revenge brewing in their minds.	"Why, I was down the village with the governor this morning, and we dropped into old Mrs. Grainger's.	A HARD TIME                                    142        X.	In spite of the strict rules I enjoyed my new life; the variety of the school work, the excitement of the games, and the companionship of so many girls of my own age, were far pleasanter to me than the quiet humdrum of our daily round at Aunt Agatha's.	"It's a nice open situation, and the air feels bracing," said Aunt Agatha, sniffing the breeze as if to test its quality.	"I can't imagine why we shouldn't turn the clothes over the end of the bed as we do at home.	I made them out of two black-headed pins I took from the mater's bonnet."	"I could forgive her the exercises," said Millicent, "if she'd only make stronger coffee.	"And would scarcely amuse them.	We dragged the dogs away, and I saw a tall boy of sixteen, much too smart for a school-boy, who brushed the marks of the Pomeranian's paws from his coat-sleeve with tender consideration.	I stood upon the platform like one in a dream; my success and the shouting girls were nothing to me, I saw only one face in the room, for there, by the doorway, clapping and cheering louder than anyone else, her dear cheeks flushed and her dark eyes shining with generous triumph was--Cathy!	The long, low gray stone house, with its mullioned windows and flagged passages, stood just above the little village of Everton, on the verge of the moors, where one could catch a glint of the distant sea and the peaks of the Cumberland mountains.	"It was the Babe's idea, too, not mine, so I won't take the credit of it.	I had left my doll's cape on the terrace, and I begged Juanita to go and fetch it.	I felt keenly the injustice of the suggestion, but I was powerless to retort.	How I have shivered with nervousness when "Miss Philippa Seaton" was called out, and I was bound to advance with becoming grace, and shake hands elegantly with Mrs. Marshall, her critical eye upon my demeanour, and her censorious tongue ready with comment if my unlucky elbows protruded, or my hand did not give the exact warmth of pressure required!

When the weather permitted we played hockey, but there were many days when it was considered too wet for us to go out, and we were obliged to take what exercises we could in the play-room.	It was really too bad."	I have even bribed the housemaid to buy me biscuits and smuggle them into my locker, incurring thereby both the risk of her dismissal and my own disgrace, for it was one of the strictest rules of the school that the girls should obtain no private supplies.	I have much pleasure in presenting Catherine Winstanley with a copy of _Moore's Irish Melodies_, and Philippa Seaton with a volume of _Extracts from Byron_."	Keep quiet now you're here, at any rate."

"Edward will be dreadfully disappointed about it.	Didn't you hear Edward reading out an account from the newspaper this morning of a robbery at Thistleton Hall?	After all, school is one's little world, and a bad mark, an unjust reproof, or a quarrel with a companion at the time, seem as overwhelming troubles as any we may encounter in after-life.	I had lived almost entirely in the nursery and school-room, and on the few occasions when I had been allowed to come down to the drawing-room the conversation was certainly far from intellectual.	"I hope you will learn to love me some day, for your mother was my dearest friend, and I could not pass through London to-day without taking the opportunity of coming to see her only child."	"We'd better get on with our burglar," said Cathy.	At that stage of his existence Edward was a dandy.	Somehow, after my friendship with the Winstanleys I realized that in some subtle way the bond between my father and myself grew and strengthened.	Not long after, however, we began to notice a most peculiar odour in the school-room.	We'd better cut, or there'll be damage done!"
