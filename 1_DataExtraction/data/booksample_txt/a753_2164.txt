Mr. T---- was also preparing for an excursion to Germany; and he was suspected of vacillating in his Butlerite views, brought over by Lady Holberton's tears and logic.	This intelligence evidently lessened Miss Rowley's excessive gratitude.	This dress, preserved in a certain old trunk in the garret, was accordingly produced.

But stay--what's this?"	The identity of this letter, with that copied by Mr. Lumley, immediately suggested itself; and now the first sparks of controversy between the Otwaysians and the Butlerites were struck in Sir John's library.	His friend spelt it through.	It was a glance of intense admiration.	1.D.	asked the pupil looking askance at letter, and tutor.	The trunk, however, shared the young soldier's wandering life; it carried the cornet's uniform to America; it was besieged in Boston; and it made part of the besieging baggage at Charleston.	1.E.	Is it not to be feared that they will yet exterminate the whole race, that the great lion literary, like the mastodon, will become extinct?	Lady Holberton, as she advanced, invited Miss Rowley, with an ill-concealed air of triumph, to feast her eyes once more on the Lumley autograph, and not long after the party broke up.

What success followed the plan we cannot say.	Mr. Lumley was not a little pleased by this confirmation of the story, though he found that Lord G---- had not even read the letter, nor did he know any thing of its subsequent fate; he only remembered looking at the signature.	1.E.5.	She continued her applications, however, casting an eye on her list.	The parting with Lady Holberton was melancholy; she was much depressed, and the physicians had recommended the waters of Wiesbaden.	"Though altogether, I am pretty well satisfied with my Chinese negotiations; as soon as the Celestial Empire was opened to the civilized world, I engaged an agent there to collect for me.	The eye of beauty was about to kindle as it rested on the Lumley autograph; jeweled fingers were to be raised, eager to snatch the treasure from each other; busy literati stood ready armed for a war of controversy in its behalf.	"And what are your albums like?"	The trunk-maker begged to hear it.	I offered her Grizzel Baillie, two Cardinals, William Pitt, and Grace Darling, for one of her Laffarges; but she would not part with it.	Lady Holberton was still inconsolable when I left London; she was thinking of traveling among the Hottentots, or in any other clime where albums are unknown and her loss could be forgotten.	I bowed an assent to the remark.	1.C.	"It was this paper, my lord, which made me so awkward--I have lighted on a document of the greatest interest!"	As we have already observed, the controversy began in the library of Sir John Blank, and it continued throughout the life-time of that excellent and well-known collector.	Or, perhaps, by taming him down to a mere producer of autographs, his habits will change so entirely that he will no longer be the same animal, no longer bear a comparison with the lion of the past.	So said the papers at least; but I knew better.	"It must have been stolen--basely stolen--on the evening of my party.	Suddenly he paused, and his antiquarian instincts were aroused by the sight of a sheet of paper, yellow and time worn.	She blushed and courtesied.	The work itself, however, was not destined to see the light; its publication was delayed, while Mr. Lumley accompanied his pupil on the usual continental tour, and from this journey the learned gentleman never returned, dying at Rome, of a cold caught in the library of the Vatican.	"Why yes--you seem to manage the job very well; and I have a trunk, by the bye, that wants patching up before my boy carries it off with him; I'll send it round to you; Hopkins.	And then I was never taught to read writing, and these 'ere papers is all written ones.	"Do?	You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word processing or hypertext form.	"If such were your suspicions, Lady Holberton," continued Miss Rowley, speaking with great deliberation--"I am happy to say they were quite correct--you only did me justice--I am proud to declare the deed was mine--" We were all speechless at hearing this sudden and bold avowal.

My blood actually boiled, as one of the company turned to me and asked in a suspicious tone, if I did not know more of its history than I chose to confess?	How richly was I rewarded for the act of good-nature!	I assured the lady we had colonels of all sorts, and begged to know what particular variety she had placed on her catalogue--was it an officer of the regular service, or one of no service at all?	Accordingly, Sir John wrote a brief notice of Butler's Life, dwelling much upon his well-known poverty, and quoting his epitaph, with the allusion to his indigence underscored, "lest he who living wanted all things, should, when dead, want a tomb," and placed these remarks opposite the letter of our starving poet, which was registered in the volume in conspicuous characters as an "Autograph of Samuel Butler, author of Hudibras, showing to what distress he was at one time reduced."	Yet the exchange was very fair, especially as Madame Laffarge is still living."	{Milesian = slang term for Irish, from Milesius, mythical Spanish conqueror of Ireland; Nawaub = from Nabob, Anglo-Indian slang for one who has returned home from India with a large fortune} "That letter is really a curiosity in its way," said the colonel, turning from the glass and relating its history, so far at least as it was known to himself.

Dr. H----, who, as we have observed, was rather eccentric in his ways, had a son about to commence his career as a soldier; and the worthy man thought the letter might teach the youth a useful lesson of moderation and temperance, by showing him every time he opened his trunk, the extreme of want to which his fellow beings were occasionally reduced.	{Paduasoy = a strong corded or gros-grain silk fabric, traditionally associated with Padua, Italy} "Still, Mr. Howard," observed that lady; "I really cannot see why you should resent the insinuation so warmly.

Howard?"	The girl had picked up the paper early one morning, in a road near Clapham, as she was going to her work; Lady Holberton gave her a handful of guineas as the promised reward--a sum by the bye just double in amount what the poor poet had received for his best poem--and she also continued to look after the family in their troubles.
