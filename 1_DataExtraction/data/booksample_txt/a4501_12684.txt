He heard a noise as if someone were outside.	The still night under the shining stars added an impressive setting to the telling, and the girl close by his side drank in hungrily every word.	Ah, the secret was out!	"Good," replied Uncle Zed.	"Whose cows were they?"	"But what shall we do, Dorian, what shall we do!	"What's the matter with being a farmer?"	You see, I've been searching for her."	"But I do care."	We hear music, we see beauty.	Dorian's mother is there with him too, I understand."	"Are you also interested in books?"	When Dorian arrived at his destination, Carlia greeted him with: "Dorian, what's the matter?"	Any deviation from that path is sin.	"Fudge," suggested the third.	It carries sounds to our ears and smells to our nostrils.	'Or see the grand beginning     Where space did not extend?	The meeting house windows are wide open, for a wonder.	Dorian arose, thanked her, and went out.	His hat was tilted back on his head, and a half-smoked cigarette sagged from his lips.	"The people do not know it," added Dorian; "perhaps their children or their children's children will."	he asked.	"As you see, Dorian," said Uncle Zed on one such Sunday evening, "my collection of books is not large, but they are such that I can read and read again."	Listen, let me say what I want to say--I believe I can now.... You're the best man I know.	"They are as well as can be expected.	"No," replied Dorian.	Dorian prospered, and he had no time to devote to the girls, so he thought, and so he said, when occasion demanded expression.	Nowhere did I find a clear, comprehendible statement of what I, an entity with countless other entities, was doing here.	"No; I suppose not."	he smilingly asked.	She had been gone now about six months, so the search had to be in some books long since discarded, much to the annoyance of the clerks.	He could not for a moment find anything to say.	"Are you her brother?"	He visited a number of adjacent towns and made diligent enquiries at hotels, stores, and some private houses.	He glimpsed the shadowy specter lurking in her background.	His open book was still before him, but he saw not the printed page.	"How long will it take for the water to reach the bottom of the row?"	"My, all sermons?	"Carlia!"	But what could they now do?	"And milking cows and feeding pigs and pitching hay."	"No; I think not, Uncle Zed; but what do you mean about mother?"	He looked about the snow-covered earth and the clouds which threatened storm.	I studied, and prayed, and went about seeking, but never finding."	Mrs. Trent made the proper introduction, then lifted the picnic basket from the table to a corner.	"She has just died."	Mildred lay well propped up by pillows in a bed white as snow.	No, of course, it isn't.	The tree isn't in the right place, so I moved it.	Lamont raised a riding whip he had in his hand, but the men interfered, and they all moved outside into the yard.	I answer, because I knew that 'spirit and element inseparately connected receiveth a fullness of joy.'	"Mother, listen to this," he said.	In the dim consciousness of waking he seemed to hear Carlia's voice calling to him as it did that winter night when he had left her, not heeding.	Then the short winter day closed.	They lingered on the cool lawn under the colored glow of the Chinese lanterns.	Parley Pratt also is good.	"All but Carlia," she announced.	Some of the lights were extinguished.	"Where is your 'Drummond's Natural Law'?"	There are no classes such as you have in mind in the Church, even though a few unthinking members seem to imply it by their actions; but there is no real class distinction in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, only such that are based on the doing of the right and the wrong.	CHAPTER TWELVE.	"You have your hands full" she said to Dorian.	"You know why you shouldn't."	I made extensive copyings in my note books.	When they were both seated, she asked him his name.	He stood looking at the closed door, and a feeling of resentment came to him.	"I would like to."	A light as if from a wood fire in a grate danced upon the white curtain of the unshaded windows.	"Well, of course, you do not have to go," said Dorian.	"There is a hymn in our hymn book in which W.W. Phelps expresses this idea beautifully.	Carlia was not a common name, and the handwriting was familiar.	He was bound by this greater knowledge to be the stronger, the wiser, the one who could keep all situations well in hand.	That disposes of the chief topics of conversation, and will give Uncle Zed a chance.	It was the first time he had been there.	A fine girl she is, a mighty fine girl--a diamond, just a little in the rough.	The second week in December Dorian went into action in search of Carlia Duke.	He has pointed out the way by teaching us the law of progress which led Him to His exalted state.	"Yes; it ought to be and is different.	There's been a lot of hard work for both of us, but now things are coming more our way, and I like it better.	"The baby?"	He recalled the girl when he and she had walked back and forth to and from the high school how she had rapidly developed her sunny nature in the warm, somewhat care-free environment of the school life, and how lately with the continual drudgery of her work, she had changed to a pessimism unnatural to one of her years.	Then he dallied so with his chores that his mother had to call him twice.	"All agnostic writers seem to think that there is no reason in religion, and at times they come pretty near proving it too," replied Dorian.
