They run about 15 feet, so they do not reach the center of the garden until late in the season.	Thorough spraying with Bordeaux mixture begun when the plants first come thru the ground and repeated often enough to keep all new growths covered, will insure immunity from the blight.	Mr. Wm E.

In September they turn a beautiful red and are very attractive to birds and squirrels.	Grub worms eat a root now and then.	These are plants of opposite nature.	After treating him for several weeks and failing to entirely relieve him, more especially the distress in bowels and back, I concluded to add Ginseng to his treatment.	1858        366,055          $ .52   1868        370,066           1.02   1878        421,395           1.17   1888        308,365           2.13   1898        174,063           3.66   1901        149,069           5.30   * * * Export of Ginseng for ten months ending April, 1908, was 144,533 pounds, valued at $1,049,736, against 92,650, valued at $634,523, for ten months ending April, 1907, and 151,188 pounds, valued at $1,106,544 for ten months ending April, 1906.	Born on a farm near St. Joseph, Mich., he early developed an idea that money was to be made in the growing of Peppermint.	In 1904 my plants came up nicely.

The outside is brownish gray and the inside white and mealy.	I attribute the curative properties of Ginseng in rheumatism to stimulating to healthy action of the gastric juices; causing a healthy flow of the digestive fluids of the stomach, thereby neutralizing the extra secretion of acid that is carried to the nervous membranes of the body and joints, causing the inflammatory condition incident to rheumatism.

Having suffered the total loss of foliage and seed crop during the season of 1904, Dr. Curtis determined to test the efficacy of the Bordeaux mixture the following season as a preventive of the blight.	It was in that state that the cultivation of the plant originated and it is there that the culture has become most extensive and perfected.	The majority of exporters of Ginseng to China are Chinamen who are located in New York and one or two cities on the Pacific coast.

The largest garden in this country, so far as known, is that of the Consolidated Ginseng Company of New York State.	What is generally used for shading?	Growing Ginseng and Golden Seal will eventually become quite an industry, but as we have said before, those that make the greatest success at the business, will follow as closely as possible the conditions under which the plants grow in the forests, in their wild state.	The leaves of the blue flag or "poison-flag," as it has been called, are very similar to those of the Sweet-Flag, and this resemblance often leads to cases of poisoning among children who thus mistake one for the other.	The price paid for May-apple root ranges from 3 to 6 cents a pound.	The leaves alternate on the stem, are lance shaped or oblong lance shaped, thin in texture, 1 to 2 inches long, and stemless.	The roots in drying become wiry and brittle and break off very readily.	I have seen some very old roots and have been told that roots with fifty scars have been dug.	The second year's crop is obtained by the simple method of plowing under the plants in the fall.	I make the rows one foot to fifteen inches apart.	Many people have great faith in the power of the Ginseng root to increase the general strength and appetite as well as to relieve eructations from the stomach.

Ginseng should only be dug for the market late in the fall.	U. S. Department of Agriculture.	This moist soil, rich in humus and other organic substances, formed an exceedingly favorable place for the growth of fungi.	The seedlings growing in the hard ground were the size of oat kernels, those in the beds beside them three to nine inches long and weighing from four to ten times as much per root.	The stems, as they emerge from the ground, are bent over, the tops still remaining underground, and sometimes the stems show some distance above the surface before the tops are brought out from the soil.	* * * Consul-General Amos P.

A good shade is made by setting posts in the ground, nail cross-pieces on these, then cover with brush.	Then just before planting rake it down level.	Other Species--Considerable confusion seems to exist in regard to which species yields the root which has proved of greatest value medicinally.	If those engaged, or about to engage, in Ginseng growing will study closely the conditions under which the wild plants flourish best, they can learn much that they will only find out after years of experimenting.	take mulch all off from beds of set roots.
