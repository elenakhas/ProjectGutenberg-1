The fiftieth put the white handkerchief back in his pocket.	Instantly, the writhing stilled.	The vehicle was heading into the sun.	The huge easy chair in which Daddy's caller (Jack thought of him only as "Mister") sat was a fallen log.	Suddenly he was falling, hurtling helplessly and sickeningly through a void while a cold and drab blast gouged his skin and spun him around and around.	It seemed inevitable that they would track him down.	Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email business@pglaf.org.	She carried a tray on which were several containers.	"He did say this--though you won't like it--that the schizos and the transies were just two sides of the same coin.	And now the shock of being caught in the raid had speeded up what everybody had foreseen.	His informant was evidently one of those transies who spent long hours in the libraries.	He said that if this schizophrenia kept on progressing, half the world would be in rehabilitation camps.	One glance stunned him so that he could not at once understand that what he was seeing was not reality.	He had searched for the man.	Section 3.	Like hundreds of thousands of other youths, he had begged and stolen and hidden from the local police and the Bohas.	The dust of another section of road swirled up before they squeaked to a standstill and the engine turned off.	He had never seen an albino before, and, indeed, he did not know what one was.	"Got any idea where we're going?"	The opaque rose lenses set in Mister's face seemed to open a door into his naked grey skull.	It was like seeing from the wrong end of a pair of binoculars that lengthened and lengthened while the man with the long-sought-for treasure in his hand flew in the opposite direction as if he had been connected to the horizon by a rubber band and somebody had released it and he was flying towards it, away from Jack.	"I see you're interested," he continued.	Lately, even when it was quiet, people seemed to have trouble making out what he was saying.	If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy.	Now, about these monthly premiums ..." Jack shook himself and stepped out of the mold of fascination that Mister's glasses seemed to have poured around him.	He had other things to think about.	"Stand still!"	The truck from the rocket had come through a gate and stopped by the transies, and about fifty men were getting off the back.

He could feel the hands of the black-clad officers lifting him up and laying him upon some hard substance that rocked and dumped.	He himself was.	A boy by Jack's side sprawled face-down on the sand while he uttered over and over again, "Mr. Pelopoeus!	"When that happens, Mr. Crane, you will understand that the world will profit from man's secret wishes.	That didn't bother him.	"My name, translated, means gracious or kindly or well-meaning."	He did not move.	But if that occurred, the sane half would go to pot.	But how does it work?	Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg: 1.E.1.	It was a measure of their contempt for the humans around them and of their own grim wit.	"Let his fancy grow.	He could no longer feel his flesh.	Jack shook his head until it cleared.	It landed and discharged about a dozen men."

Mr. Eumenes-or-his-twin was shooting away faster and faster and becoming smaller and smaller.	Eumenes!"	A sergeant boomed orders.	Jack stared at the impenetrable lenses and nodded dumbly.	Then he was placed upon something softer and carried into what he vaguely sensed was the interior of one of the barracks.	Jack was drifting on a yielding and wine-tinted air and warmed with a wind that seemed to swell him out like a happy balloon....	We should never cripple the fine gift of imagination in the young.	He was in white and wore a stethoscope around his neck.	Nor was the Persian rug there.	If he had run across him during his search, he would have been denied the glasses, as now.	Some of those in front of Jack fell to their knees as if a sudden poison had paralyzed their legs.	They were ready at the slightest chance to offer their encyclopaedic but often useless knowledge.	How many other transies had seen that unforgettable face on the streets, the end of their search, and gone at once into that state that made them legal prey of the Bohas?	Now, let's call the toy a specterscope, because through it the subject sees the spectres that haunt his unconscious.	"Let him play here if he wants to.	They were not the pale pink of an albino's.	For two weeks.	They would fester.	He, Uncas, meant to hide behind it in ambush.	He should have known that Mr. Eumenes was the worst thing in the world for him.

Like jewels.	He nodded his head.	He had graduated from high school with only average marks, and then, instead of going to college, as his father had so much wanted him to, he had decided he would work a year.	That was almost his last rational thought.	Every lurch and thud was only dimly felt.	1.F.1.	He crouched beside the chair while his brain tried to move again, tried to engulf a thought and failed because it could not become fluid enough to find the idea that would move his tongue to shriek, _No!

He had thrown his name like a gauntlet to humanity, and humanity had stared idiotically at it and never guessed its meaning.	Jack paid him no attention.
