Alone, his pride was undamaged.	--the damned Martians and the traitors from Luna are driving over the Argentine.	The treachery even in his own army, among his own generals and admirals.	He retreated a step to keep beyond their front rank.	Times he would pace the beach at night and overhead would be the roar of jets and rockets, the ships that had roared over New Albuquerque, his capitol, in those last days before he had fled.	Mr. Smith knew that, for although his choice of destinations had been a hasty choice, yet there had been time for him to read the available reports.	Here in this new world, there was only he and the _kifs_.	"Number One ..." "Silence!"	It moved, although there was no breeze to move it.	His throat raw from the screaming invective of his hate.	Stirrings there, in the branches.	But stark fear and the memory of unendurable pain drove him on.	Like the Martians--but unlike the Martians, they did not fight back.	And there was an almost sudden _edge_, beyond which the blades thinned out quickly to barrenness.	Nothing to worry about, except the bitterness.	Fascinated, he stared down at them.	Nrana did not know the words for delirium and paranoia, but he could distinguish between them.	He said, "I will serve you, yes.	The others tied the Earthling up and threw him into one of the huts.	Mere annoyance.	Stirrings and voices in the night.	And the sound--it was like the sound of the surf, but it was continuous.	Naked, now, and with only a few _kifs_ still clinging to him.	"As you will."	"All Earthlings come from the sky.	Someday the trees-- But that was just a dream, a fancy.	This, then, was _pain_.	Then, as abruptly as light goes on when a switch is thrown, the noise vanished.	Perhaps the opportunity would come then to destroy, to destroy, _and destroy_.	The war is over, lost.	But he got himself erect again on trembling legs, and staggered on.	The _kifs_-- In the intensity of his hatred there slowly filtered through a grudging admiration.	It was more like the rustle of dry leaves, but there were no dry leaves to rustle.	Drums.	All I can give you in reward is my thanks.	But they got into his bed, into his clothes, into his food.	But the _kifs_ served a purpose for him.	There was the _marigee_ who would shriek "_All is lost!_" He had shot at it a hundred times with his needle gun, but always it flew away unharmed.	Click of heels and a salute that once greeted the Caesars, and later the pseudo-Aryan of the 20th Century, and, but yesterday, he who was now known as _the last of the dictators_.	And then, less bitterly.	And Nrana shook his head sadly, "But many of our tribe have gone back to the older gods, the cruel gods.	He stalked it to strangle it with his bare hands.	Two of the men carried Mr. Smith into the chief's hut, and the wives of the chief and the chief's son took over the Earthling's care, and rubbed him with a soothing and healing salve.	Utter silence, and at last he was strong enough to let go his grip on the tree and stand erect again, to look about to get his bearings.	"That is all.	They were the ones who persecuted him.	That eternal haze that would always be there to mock his failure and his bitter solitude.	*       *       *       *       * Into the village compound just before dawn, staggered a man, a naked terrestrial.	He could see one edge of the column, and it was a neat, orderly edge.	Those were the days when the waves of hatred from the conquered peoples beat upon his country as the waves of a stormy sea beat upon crumbling cliffs.	But for days and nights he lay without moving and without speaking or opening his eyes, and they did not know whether he would live or die.	And they talked long and the dusk grew into night while they talked of what they must do.	His ego was intact.	*       *       *       *       * Mr. Smith was coming back all right, and sooner than they had dared to hope.	Alwa gave quick, excited orders.	The eyes of the dictator closed.	He shook his fist at them and shrieked imprecations at the sky.	"You were the chief.	He retreated another step--and then, quite suddenly, his body was afire in several spreading places.	His mind is not well."	So they cared for him well, and his wounds healed, and the day came when he opened his eyes and saw the handsome blue-complexioned face of Nrana sitting there beside him, and Nrana said softly, "Good day, Mr. Man of Earth.	"There is a breakthrough at Denver, Number One!	There was no threat, for him, in that throbbing that was like the beating of the jungle's heart.	They were a simple, weak race.	In his larder, wherever he did it.	But that did not matter; there was plenty of food.	Individual _kifs_ could be killed, and he took savage satisfaction in their killing, but he knew his methods were useless save for the pleasure and the purpose they gave him.	The _kifs_, the Venusian equivalent of the Terran ant, stole his food.	The damned Martians who came back after he had driven them halfway across their damned arid planet.	Sometimes, fantastic thoughts went through his head.	He sat the legs of the cot in dishes of gasoline, but the _kifs_ still got in.	Alwa's wrinkled hands went to his scrawny neck where, just off the center, was a sudden tiny pin prick of a hole.	"In others, there is great hatred.	Goodbye."	Row after row, orderly rank after orderly rank, marching resistlessly onward.	He wet his lips when he read that.	You feel better, no?"	The crescendo of motors as he ran, sobbing now in fear, for the cover of the jungle.	You will be able to help those of us who have gone back.	So, there would be no difficulty in avoiding the natives, nor danger if he did encounter them.	Nrana could see that those eyes were not yet sane, but he saw, too, that the madness in them was not the same that it had been.	The _baroons_ and the _marigees_ didn't count.	Not the martial roll of marching, nor yet a threatening note of savage hate.
