'Tis bought: to make a lengthy tale concise, The man becomes a clown who once was nice, Talks all of elms and vineyards, ploughs and soil, And ages fast with struggling and sheer toil; Till, when his sheep are stolen, his bullock drops, His goats die off, a blight destroys his crops, One night he takes a waggon-horse, and sore With all his losses, rides to Philip's door.	When the whim leads, I saunter forth alone, Ask how are herbs, and what is flour a stone, Lounge through the Circus with its crowd of liars, Or in the Forum, when the sun retires, Talk to a soothsayer, then go home to seek My frugal meal of fritter, vetch, and leek: Three youngsters serve the food: a slab of white Contains two cups, one ladle, clean and bright: Next, a cheap basin ranges on the shelf, With jug and saucer of Campanian delf: Then off to bed, where I can close my eyes Not thinking how with morning I must rise And face grim Marsyas, who is known to swear Young Novius' looks are what he cannot bear.	Well, but for us; what thoughts should ours be, say, Removed from vulgar judgments miles away?	Davus gets called a loiterer and a scamp, You (save the mark!)	Veianius fastens to Alcides' gate His arms, then nestles in his snug estate: Think you once more upon the arena's marge He'd care to stand and supplicate discharge?

The guest, rejoicing in his altered fare, Assumes in turn a genial diner's air, When hark!	'Tis best with roasted shrimps and Afric snails To rouse your drinker when his vigour fails: Not lettuce; lettuce after wine ne'er lies Still in the stomach, but is sure to rise: The appetite, disordered and distressed, Wants ham and sausage to restore its zest; Nay, craves for peppered viands and what not, Fetched from some greasy cookshop steaming hot.	Sweet oil's the staple of the first; but wine Should be thrown in, and strong Byzantine brine.	"Quintus, the scribes entreat you to attend A meeting of importance, as their friend."	HUMANO CAPITI.	PRIMA DICTE MIHI.	What of the town of Samos, trim and neat, And what of Sardis, Croesus' royal seat?	Avarice will scarce find lodging in a heart Whose every thought is centred on its art; He lays no subtle schemes, your dreamy bard, To circumvent his partner or his ward; Content with pulse and bread of ration corn, Mres, losses, runaways he laughs to scorn; Useless in camp, at home he serves the state, That is, if small can minister to great.	Now turn to us shy mortals, who, instead Of being hissed and acted, would be read: We claim your favour, if with worthy gear You'd fill the temple Phoebus holds so dear, And give poor bards the stimulus of hope To aid their progress up Parnassus' slope.	Just as Hennogenes, when silent, still Remains a singer of consummate skill, As sly Alfenius, when he had let drop His implements of art and shut up shop, Was still a barber, so the wise is best In every craft, a king's among the rest."

Wrath is a short-lived madness: curb and bit Your mind: 'twill rule you, if you rule not it While the colt's mouth is soft, the trainer's skill Moulds it to follow at the rider's will.	II.	Make light of pleasure: pleasure bought with pain Yields little profit, but much more of bane.	The nuptial bed is in his hall; he swears None but a single life is free from cares: Is he a bachelor?	Such are the marks of freedom: look them through, And tell me, is there one belongs to you?	Now listen, dramatists, and I will tell What I expect, and all the world as well.	Well, but I called him muddy, said you'd find More sand than gold in what he leaves behind.	H. I own I'm foolish--truth must have her will-- Nay, mad: but tell me, what's my form of ill?	And yet, methinks, you've plenty on your hands In breaking up these long unharrowed lands; The ox, unyoked and resting from the plough, Wants fodder, stripped from elm or poplar bough; You've work too at the river, when there's rain, As, but for a strong bank,'twould flood the plain.	No brainless trunk is yours: a form to please, Wealth, wit to use it, Heaven vouchsafes you these.	I'm just his double: when my purse is lean I hug myself, and praise the golden mean, Stout when not tempted; but suppose some day A special titbit comes into my way, I vow man's happiness is ne'er complete Till based on a substantial country seat.	The horse would plough, the ox would draw the car.	H.                                 Or a pike?	Each has its place allotted; each is bound To keep it, nor invade its neighbour's ground.	How shall I hold this Proteus in my gripe?	Suppose I say "Your theatres have ne'er been in my way, Nor I in theirs: large audiences require Some heavier metal than my thin-drawn wire:" "You put me off," he answers, "with a sneer: Your works are kept for Jove's imperial ear: Yes, you're a paragon of bards, you think, And no one else brews nectar fit to drink."	You blame your pens, and the poor wall, accurst From birth by gods and poets, comes off worst.

"Aye, but I sit before my colleague; he Ranks with my worthy father, not with me."	you have but to appear In Mars's field to raise a general cheer: Remember too, you served a hard campaign, When scarce past boyhood, in the wars of Spain, Beneath his lead who brings our standards home, And makes each nook of earth a prize for Rome.	Though instinct tells you, Scaeva, how to act, And makes you live among the great with tact, Yet hear a fellow-student; 'tis as though The blind should point you out the way to go, But still give heed, and see if I produce Aught that hereafter you may find of use.	"O may I yet possess The goods I have, or, if Heaven pleases, less!	Nor would the land we love be now more strong In warrior's prowess than in poet's song, Did not her bards with one consent decline The tedious task, to alter and refine.	'I will know the price.'

Though here I'm kept administering relief To my poor Lamia's broken-hearted grief For his lost brother, ne'ertheless my thought Flies to my woods, and counts the distance nought.	'Tis that we look for; not to shift a weight Which little frames and little souls think great, But stoop and bear it.	The wise and good, like Bacchus in the play, When Fortune threats, will have the nerve to say: "Great king of Thebes, what pains can you devise The man who will not serve you to chastise?"	Poor bards!	H. Catius, I beg, by all that binds a friend, Let me go with you, when you next attend; For though you've every detail at command, There's something must be lost at second hand.
