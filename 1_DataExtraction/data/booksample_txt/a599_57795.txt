There is some interesting gossip about Mary Fitton and a good anecdote of Sir William Knollys.	The poetic drama must have an emotional unity, let the emotion be whatever you like.	Massinger fancied this galley-slave; for he comes with his oar again in the _Bondman_—     Never did galley-slave shake off his chains,     Or looked on his redemption from the oar.... Now these are mature plays; and the _Roman Actor_ (from which we have drawn the two previous extracts) is said to have been the preferred play of its author.	Perhaps the emotions are not significant enough to endure full daylight.	The other aspect of this Impersonal theory of poetry is the relation of the poem to its author.	Tragedy is a crude classification for plays so different in their tone as _Macbeth_, _The Jew of Malta_, and _The Witch of Edmonton_; and it does not help us much to say that _The Merchant of Venice_ and _The Alchemist_ are comedies.	In either case, you would have had at least the excitement of following the movements of an important mind groping towards important conclusions.	There are some poets whose every line has unique value.	The two great followers of Shakespeare, Webster and Tourneur, in their mature work do not borrow from him; he is too close to them to be of use to them in this way.	But not many people are capable of discovering for themselves the beauty which is only found after labour; and Jonson’s industrious readers have been those whose interest was historical and curious, and those who have thought that in discovering the historical and curious interest they had discovered the artistic value as well.	Mr. More has, it seems to me, in this sentence just failed to put his finger on the right seriousness of great literary art: the seriousness which we find in Villon’s _Testament_ and which is conspicuously absent from _In Memoriam_; or the seriousness which controls _Amos Barton_ and not _The Mill on the Floss_.	But Massinger’s comedy differs just as widely from the comedy of manners proper; he is closer to that in his romantic drama—in _A Very Woman_—than in _A New Way to Pay Old Debts_; in his comedy his interest is not in the follies of love-making or the absurdities of social pretence, but in the unmasking of villainy.	Accordingly, Mr. Whibley does not disappear in the jungle of journalism and false criticism; he deserves a “place upon the shelves” of those who care for English literature.	Jonson employs immense dramatic constructive skill: it is not so much skill in plot as skill in doing without a plot.	Very few treat art seriously.	The artistic result of _Volpone_ is not due to any effect that Volpone, Mosca, Corvino, Corbaccio, Voltore have upon each other, but simply to their combination into a whole.	It consists in an internal incoherence of feelings, a concatenation of emotions which signifies nothing.	The other method, that of Mr. Whibley, is to communicate a taste for the period—and for the best of the period so far as it is of that period.	II Honest criticism and sensitive appreciation is directed not upon the poet but upon the poetry.	He was perhaps the _satisfaction_ of more, and of more complicated feelings; and perhaps he was, as the great tragic characters must have been, the offspring of deeper, less apprehensible feelings: deeper, but not necessarily stronger or more intense, than those of Jonson.	There was a career in the Commons, a conspicuous career as Irish Secretary.	Wyndham forgets, in short, that it is not, in the end, periods and traditions but individual men who write great prose.	Jonson behaved as the great creative mind that he was: he created his own world, a world from which his followers, as well as the dramatists who were trying to do something wholly different, are excluded.	It is in this depersonalization that art may be said to approach the condition of science.	Both errors tend to make him “personal.” Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality.	We should have to understand things which Shakespeare did not understand himself.	The essay on Ralegh gives still less.	Certain works of philosophy can be called works of art: much of Aristotle and Plato, Spinoza, parts of Hume, Mr. Bradley’s _Principles of Logic_, Mr. Russell’s essay on “Denoting”: clear and beautifully formed thought.	In the indefinable touches which make up the music of a verse [says     Boyle], in the artistic distribution of pauses, and in the unerring     choice and grouping of just those words which strike the ear as the     perfection of harmony, there are, if we leave Cyril Tourneur’s     _Atheist’s Tragedy_ out of the question, only two masters in the     drama, Shakespeare in his latest period and Massinger.	From that point of view the Shavian drama is a hybrid as the Maeterlinckian drama is, and we need express no surprise at their belonging to the same epoch.	Here is the manifestation of type.	He did not apply himself to this sort of problem because this was not the sort of problem that interested him.	E il modo ancor m’offende.	In the final play of Shakespeare, on the other hand, there is a motive which is more important than that of revenge, and which explicitly “blunts” the latter; the delay in revenge is unexplained on grounds of necessity or expediency; and the effect of the “madness” is not to lull but to arouse the king’s suspicion.	His great merit as a critic is really one which, like many signal virtues, can be stated so simply as to appear flat.	We know, or think we know, from the enormous mass of critical writing that has appeared in the French language the critical method or habit of the French; we only conclude (we are such unconscious people) that the French are “more critical” than we, and sometimes even plume ourselves a little with the fact, as if the French were the less spontaneous.	This might well be Jonson.	Swinburne’s essay would have been all the better if he had applied himself to the solution of problems like this.	The choruses from Euripides by H. D. are, allowing for errors and even occasional omissions of difficult passages, much nearer to both Greek and English than Mr. Murray’s.	Mr. More indicates his own attitude in praising those whom he elevates to the position of masters of criticism:     If they deal much with the criticism of literature, this is because     in literature more manifestly than anywhere else life displays its     infinitely varied motives and results; and their practice is always     to render literature itself more consciously a criticism of life.	The lack of balance is to be suspected elsewhere.	Let us avoid the assumption that rhetoric is a vice of manner, and endeavour to find a rhetoric of substance also, which is right because it issues from what it has to express.	Consequently, the blank verse of their plays accomplished a subtlety and consciousness, even an intellectual power, that no blank verse since has developed or even repeated; elsewhere this age is crude, pedantic, or loutish in comparison with its contemporary France or Italy.	It is very much alive, with this singular life of its own.	It is a world like Lobatchevsky’s; the worlds created by artists like Jonson are like systems of non-Euclidean geometry.	But the paragraph gives the impression of more than one error of analysis.	This is in itself a considerable merit.	Mr. Cruickshank, Coleridge, and Leslie Stephen are pretty well agreed that Massinger is no master of characterization.	When there is this economy of effort it is possible to have several, even many, good poets at once.	There are hundreds of people who have read _Comus_ to ten who have read the _Masque of Blackness_.	If we look at the work of Jonson’s great contemporaries, Shakespeare, and also Donne and Webster and Tourneur (and sometimes Middleton), have a depth, a third dimension, as Mr. Gregory Smith rightly calls it, which Jonson’s work has not.	He approached everything with a mind unclouded by current opinions.	He does not wholly partake in that “conscious creation of the field of the present out of the past” which Mr. More considers to be part of the work of the critic.	It is impossible to deny the masterly construction of this passage; perhaps there is not one living poet who could do the like.	It is curious that not only Dante’s detractors, like the Petrarch of Landor’s _Pentameron_ (if we may apply so strong a word to so amiable a character), but some of his admirers, insist on the separation of Dante’s “poetry” and Dante’s “teaching.” Sometimes the philosophy is confused with the allegory.	Swinburne as Poet It is a question of some nicety to decide how much must be read of any particular poet.	His taste, even, becomes less certain as he fixes it on individuals within his period.	He says:     In meeting [Ulysses], as in meeting Pier della Vigna and Brunetto     Latini, the preacher and the prophet are lost in the poet.	The “madness” of Hamlet lay to Shakespeare’s hand; in the earlier play a simple ruse, and to the end, we may presume, understood as a ruse by the audience.	We have on the one hand the “poetic” drama, imitation Greek, imitation Elizabethan, or modern-philosophical, on the other the comedy of “ideas,” from Shaw to Galsworthy, down to the ordinary social comedy.	Let the common sewer take it from distinction....	Rose leaves, when the rose is dead,     Are heaped for the beloved’s bed;     And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,     Love itself shall slumber on.	The tendency of the romantic drama was toward a form which continued it in removing its more conspicuous vices, was toward a more severe external order.	And we need a number of educated poets who shall at least have opinions about Greek drama, and whether it is or is not of any use to us.	Just as the Old Comedy of Molière differs in principle from the New Comedy of Marivaux, so the Old Comedy of Massinger differs from the New Comedy of his contemporary Shirley.	But it is something which distinguishes Barabas from Shylock, Epicure Mammon from Falstaff, Faustus from—if you will—Macbeth; Marlowe and Jonson from Shakespeare and the Shakespearians, Webster, and Tourneur.	We may add two more passages, not given by our commentator; here the model is Webster.	It must have a dominant tone; and if this be strong enough, the most heterogeneous emotions may be made to reinforce it.	_The Spanish Tragedy_ is bombastic when it descends to language which was only the trick of its age; _Tamburlaine_ is bombastic because it is monotonous, inflexible to the alterations of emotion.	But the direction in which Marlowe’s verse might have moved, had he not “dyed swearing,” is quite un-Shakespearean, is toward this intense and serious and indubitably great poetry, which, like some great painting and sculpture, attains its effects by something not unlike caricature.	(_Doctor Faustus_) and compare the whole set with Spenser again (_F.	Here, again, is a false simplification.	He appears, more clearly than Mr. More, and certainly more clearly than any critic of equal authority in America or England, to perceive Europe as a whole; he has the cosmopolitan mind and a tendency to seek the centre.	The intervention of performers introduces a complication of economic conditions which is in itself likely to be injurious.	It is a concentration, and a new thing resulting from the concentration, of a very great number of experiences which to the practical and active person would not seem to be experiences at all; it is a concentration which does not happen consciously or of deliberation.	What may be considered corrupt or decadent in the morals of Massinger is not an alteration or diminution in morals; it is simply the disappearance of all the personal and real emotions which this morality supported and into which it introduced a kind of order.	And we have had the plays of M. Maeterlinck and M.	These Mr. Robertson believes to be scenes in the original play of Kyd reworked by a third hand, perhaps Chapman, before Shakespeare touched the play.	We shall probably be obliged to conclude that a large part of their excellence is, in some way which should be defined, fortuitous; and that therefore they are, however remarkable, not works of perfect art.	The man who wrote, in _Volpone_:                                 for thy love,     In varying figures, I would have contended     With the blue Proteus, or the hornèd flood.... and                         See, a carbuncle     May put out both the eyes of our Saint Mark;     A diamond would have bought Lollia Paulina,     When she came in like star-light, hid with jewels.... is related to Marlowe as a poet; and if Marlowe is a poet, Jonson is also.	You will not find it in the _Duke of Gandia_.	Massinger does not confuse metaphors, or heap them one upon another.	It is superficial with a vacuum behind it; the superficies of Jonson is solid.
