"We can't reach you, Raggedy Andy!"	"Good for you!"	Dickie would have been sorry, too, if he had been more than two years old, but when one is only two years old, he has very few sorrows.	Raggedy Andy laughed.	We can open a door or a window for you and let you out, if you must go!"	Raggedy Andy tried to wiggle backward up the pipe, but his clothes caught upon a little piece of tin which stuck out from the inside of the pipe and there he stayed.	His shiny wheels and the pretty yellow wheels of the red wagon creaked so loudly none of the dolls heard the cries of the tiny penny dolls who were too small to climb aboard.	Raggedy Andy tiptoed to the door and over to the head of the stairs.	Raggedy Andy and Uncle Clem stood looking out of the door, the rest of the dolls peeping over their shoulders, so when something came jumping through the door, it hit Uncle Clem and Raggedy Andy and sent them flying against the other dolls behind them.	all the dolls cried.	So, just like tonight, we went to the pincushion and found a needle and thread and I sewed it on for him!"	And Susan, although she had only a cracked head, ran out the nursery door followed by all the rest of the dolls.	When the wooden horse upset Raggedy Ann, he stood still until Uncle Clem and Henny and Raggedy Andy lifted him off Raggedy Ann's feet.	cried Raggedy Andy generously.	Raggedy Andy answered, "I'm just stuffed with white cotton and I have no candy heart, but some day perhaps I shall have!"	Ha!	Fido answered.	the bunny said.	"Hooray!"	And that was a long time.	"She won!"	"I can still feel it!	"He means a tug of war, don't you, Raggedy Andy?"	Henny, the Dutch doll, suggested.	Marcella could not remember where she put him; so when I get him nice and dry, I'll hide him in a nice easy place for her to find, and she will not know he has been out in the rain all night!"	So the stew kettle was dragged to the sink and filled with water, the dolls all taking turns scraping the candy from the sides of the kettle, and scrubbing the inside with a cloth.	After her ran all the dollies, their little feet pitter-patting across the floor and down the hall.	Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!)	But just as they got almost to the door, they dropped to the floor in a heap, for there, standing watching the whole performance, was a man.	When the kettle was nice and clean and had been wiped dry, Raggedy Andy found a roll of waxed paper in the pantry upon one of the shelves.	Then he motioned for the other dolls to come.	Raggedy Andy washed it all nice and clean, and then wet the glue which made the pretty curls stay on.	Raggedy Andy told all the dolls to rub butter upon their hands.	"I know," said Raggedy Ann, "but we cannot waken Mama to ask her!"	When the Easter bunny had finished painting the eggs he put them in his basket and, with all the dolls running along beside him, they returned to the house.	It was a large shell with many points upon it.	He thought and thought, until the yarn hair upon his head stood up in the air and wiggled.	"If that is the case, we can have the taffy pull and all the fun that goes with it!"	When they came to the Easter bunny's home, they found Mama Easter bunny and a lot of little teeny weeny bunnies who would some day grow up to be big Easter bunnies like their Mama and Daddy bunny.	"How in the world did the bunny get inside the house and into this room without awakening Fido?"	said Uncle Clem.	"Perhaps I did!"	And Raggedy Andy again leaned over the little toy stove and rubbed his rag hands briskly together.	RAGGEDY ANDY'S SMILE Raggedy Andy's smile was gone.	Raggedy Andy smiled and leaned back in his chair.	"You may come out from behind the rocking horse now, Easter bunny!"	"Oh, indeed we shall!"	"I could not tell you which way he went!"	"For although you may not enter into our games, we will always know that you are happily singing, and that will make us all happy!"	as it began to freeze.	said Raggedy Andy.	She always acted as a mother to the other dolls when they were alone.	"Indeed you may!"	"Just see here!"	All the dolls took turns putting their ears to the mouth of the beautiful shell.	It will only take a few minutes, so when I return and scratch again to make a nest, please do not bark at me!"	as plain as I hear you!"	"I am so glad!"	And I remember now, I had to jump over a basket out by the shed!	"You will like it here in the nursery very much!"	The pretty pond was covered with ice, too, and upon the ice was a soft blanket of the white, white snow.	And there I stayed and stayed until I began to feel stiff and could hear the cotton inside me go, 'Tic!	What shall it be?"	"How strange and far away it sounds!"	The dolls were all very sad.	cried Uncle Clem.	The dolls all laughed at this, for they knew very well that even had Mama been awake, they would not have asked her for needle and thread, because they did not wish her to know they could act and talk just like real people.	To the kitchen they all raced.	"Yes, indeed!"	"Oh, yes!	"May we go with you and watch you color the Easter eggs?"	he exclaimed when he had peeped around the corner of the roof, "the gutter ends here and there is nothing but a hole!"	On a nail?"	So there was nothing to do but get Raggedy Andy out of the tangle!"	over and over, until they wound up, laughing, at the bottom.	[Illustration: Watching the cuckoo clock] [Illustration: Friends] [Illustration: Raggedy Andy in the sugar] THE TAFFY PULL "I know how we can have a whole lot of fun!"	And Fido, pretending to be asleep, slowly opened one eye and winked over the edge of his basket at Raggedy Andy.	She still wore her happy smile.	Now the dolls could be very, very quiet when they really wished to be, and it was easy for them to hear the faint whispering of the shell.	he asked when Raggedy Ann stood up and smoothed her apron.	"It is queer that anything so rough on the outside could be so pretty within!"	And Raggedy Andy lay upon the floor of the nursery and showed the dollies just how it was done.	"Why don't you stay out in the woods and fields where you really belong?"
