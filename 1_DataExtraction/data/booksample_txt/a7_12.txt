Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.	With sobs and tears he sorted out       Those of the largest size.	Just then flew down a monstrous crow,       As black as a tar-barrel;      Which frightened both the heroes so,       They quite forgot their quarrel.’ ‘I know what you’re thinking about,’ said Tweedledum: ‘but it isn’t so, nohow.’ ‘Contrariwise,’ continued Tweedledee, ‘if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn’t, it ain’t.	'Well, it no use YOUR talking about waking him,' said Tweedledum, 'when you're only one of the things in his dream.	Alice couldn't say honestly that he was.	‘I hope you’ve got your hair well fastened on?’ he continued, as they set off.	I’m just one hundred and one, five months and a day.’ ‘I can’t believe THAT!’ said Alice.	The SONG is called “WAYS AND MEANS”: but that’s only what it’s CALLED, you know!’ ‘Well, what IS the song, then?’ said Alice, who was by this time completely bewildered.	They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was just looking round to see if the word "TWEEDLE" was written at the back of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one marked 'DUM.'	'It's a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say.	‘Next Boy!’ said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt quite certain he would only shout out ‘Contrariwise!’ and so he did.	'I wish I knew!'	In another moment both Queens were fast asleep, and snoring loud.	This seemed quite natural (she remembered afterwards), and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing, and it was done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one across the other, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks.	'Nohow!'	‘I should think throwing cold water over you would be better,’ Alice suggested: ‘or some sal-volatile.’ ‘I didn’t say there was nothing BETTER,’ the King replied.	I really MUST get a thinner pencil.	'But I had some poetry repeated to me, much easier than that, by--Tweedledee, I think it was.'	Well, THIS turn goes to the hill, I suppose--no, it doesn’t!	‘Then it would die, of course.’ ‘But that must happen very often,’ Alice remarked thoughtfully.	'Fan her head!'	'And as for YOU,' she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red Queen, whom she considered as the cause of all the mischief--but the Queen was no longer at her side--she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her.	'Can't you?'	said the Frog.	I wish YOU had made it.’ ‘Why do you wish _I_ had made it?’ Alice asked.	‘The rule is, jam to-morrow and jam yesterday--but never jam to-day.’ ‘It MUST come sometimes to “jam to-day,”’ Alice objected.	Humpty Dumpty growled out.	‘What would be the good of having it all over again?’ By this time it was getting light.	‘There really are--and SUCH beauties!’ ‘You needn’t say “please” to ME about ‘em,’ the Sheep said, without looking up from her knitting: ‘I didn’t put ‘em there, and I’m not going to take ‘em away.’ ‘No, but I meant--please, may we wait and pick some?’ Alice pleaded.	1.F.2.	'And darker,' said Tweedledee.	So of course Nobody walks slower than you.'	‘I shouldn’t know you again if we DID meet,’ Humpty Dumpty replied in a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake; ‘you’re so exactly like other people.’ ‘The face is what one goes by, generally,’ Alice remarked in a thoughtful tone.

'I haven't, indeed!'	said Alice, quite pleased to find that she HAD chosen a good subject, after all.	But then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name!	I suppose you wouldn’t have two pudding-courses in one dinner?’ ‘Well, not the NEXT day,’ the Knight repeated as before: ‘not the next DAY.	‘You shouldn’t have run him through with your horn, you know.’ ‘It didn’t hurt him,’ the Unicorn said carelessly, and he was going on, when his eye happened to fall upon Alice: he turned round rather instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the deepest disgust.

Alice could only look puzzled: she was thinking of the pudding.	I wonder I never thought of that before--But I can't stay there long.	‘You must hit the TREES pretty often, I should think,’ she said.	'Don't let us quarrel,' the White Queen said in an anxious tone.	‘Or else it doesn’t, you know.	They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that Alice couldn't help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying 'First Boy!'	'I say, this isn't fair!'	'You alarm me!'	I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire--and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty!	Ahoy!	'I'm afraid I'm giving you a great deal of trouble.'	The land there is worth a thousand pounds an inch!’ ‘Don’t make excuses,’ said the Guard: ‘you should have bought one from the engine-driver.’ And once more the chorus of voices went on with ‘The man that drives the engine.	Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The Looking-Glass, this was the one that she always remembered most clearly.

'Make a remark,' said the Red Queen: 'it's ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the pudding!'	Why, you’re only a sort of thing in his dream!’ ‘If that there King was to wake,’ added Tweedledum, ‘you’d go out--bang!--just like a candle!’ ‘I shouldn’t!’ Alice exclaimed indignantly.	'Oh, oh, oh!'	‘One or two--several.’ There was a short silence after this, and then the Knight went on again.	Oh, what fun it’ll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and can’t get at me!’ Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible.	'When I make a word do a lot of work like that,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'I always pay it extra.'	'Didn't I tell you?'	the Queen said in a pitying tone.	'I haven't pricked it YET,' the Queen said, 'but I soon shall--oh, oh, oh!'	I must have TWO, you know--to come and go.	'I know THAT!'	He raised his hands in some excitement as he said this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a deep ditch.	Alice hastily said, hoping to keep him from beginning.	Tweedledee began instantly:        ‘The sun was shining--’ Here Alice ventured to interrupt him.	‘I never saw anybody that looked stupider,’ a Violet said, so suddenly, that Alice quite jumped; for it hadn’t spoken before.	said Haigha.	However, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisper--so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said.	However, he gets on again pretty easily--that comes of having so many things hung round the horse--' So she went on talking to herself, as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and the Knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other.	‘Besides, if I’M only a sort of thing in his dream, what are YOU, I should like to know?’ ‘Ditto’ said Tweedledum.	Everybody seemed satisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of trains jumping at all.	‘You can’t possibly do that,’ said the Rose: ‘_I_ should advise you to walk the other way.’ This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at once towards the Red Queen.

Faster!’ And they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground, breathless and giddy.
