And as for you, squire, as sure as you stand there, this young lady is your lawful wedded wife: and to convince you that I speak nothing but the truth, here is the license by which you were married together."	Honest Farmer Williams was not last among these visitors, but heartily offered his friendship.	"Gone, child!"	Such is the patriot's boast where'er we roam,  His first, best country, ever is at home.	When I received my mother's letter from home, I immediately came down, determined to punish the betrayer of our honour, and sent him an order to meet me, which he answered, not in person, but by despatching four of his domestics to seize me.	Fall, round me fall, ye little things,             Ye statesmen, warriors, poets, kings!	HONEYW.	The gamester, too, whose wit's all high or low,  Oft risks his fortune on one desperate throw,  Comes here to saunter, having made his bets,  Finds his lost senses out, and pays his debts.	The gay coquette, who ogles all the day,  Comes here at night, and goes a prude away.	thou fond deceiver,                Still importunate and vain,              To former joys recurring ever,                And turning all the past to pain:              Thou, like the world, the oppress'd oppressing,                Thy smiles increase the wretch's woe;              And he who wants each other blessing,                In thee must ever find a foe.	I walked along with earnestness, and inquired of several by the way; but received no accounts, till entering the town, I was met by a person on horseback, whom I remembered to have seen at the squire's, and he assured me that if I followed them to the races, which were but thirty miles further, I might depend upon overtaking them; for he had seen them dance there the night before, and the whole assembly seemed charmed with my daughter's performance.	I'm proud of  bringing two persons of such merit together, that only want to know, to  esteem each other.	It  will be proper to keep up the decorums of resentment a little, if it be  only to impress her with an idea of my authority.	She could only answer with a fixed look and a flood of tears.	YOUNG MARLOW (HIS SON).	'Ay,' cried he, 'this is, indeed, a very pretty career that has been chalked out for you.	Their manner  of drinking is setting a very bad example in this house, I assure you.	I will never call her daughter more.	CROAKER.	"I must confess, sir," cried he, "that your present disappointment does not entirely displease me.	(_Aside._) A very troublesome fellow  this, as ever I met with.	JARVIS.	We must try him once more, however, and I'll go this instant  to put my scheme into execution; and I don't despair of succeeding, as  by your means, I can have frequent opportunities of being about him,  without being known.	[Illustration:   CROAKER.—"_How does he look now?_"—_p._ 310. ]	(_Reading._) For the first course at the top, a pig, and pruin  sauce.	But all is now over; I have survived my reputation,  my fortune, my friendships; and nothing remains henceforward for me but  solitude and repentance.	When vice my dart and scythe supply,             How great a king of terrors I!	I would have all men kings.	To yonder gloomy dungeon turn your eyes,  See where dethroned your captive monarch lies;  Deprived of sight and rankling in his chain,  See where he mourns his friends and children slain.	1 FEL.	I am, dear Sir,                                  Your sincere friend and ardent admirer,                                                        OLIVER GOLDSMITH.	In innocence and youth complaining,    Next appear'd a lovely maid;  Affliction, o'er each feature reigning,    Kindly came in beauty's aid;  Every grace that grief dispenses,    Every glance that warms the soul,  In sweet succession charms the senses,    While pity harmonized the whole.	rather let us triumph still the more,  And as our fortune sinks, our spirits soar.	The monster!_"—_p._ 140. ]	MISS RICH.	Damn the French, the parle vous, and all that belongs to  them.	For set in case—  HONEYW.	I had some knowledge of music, with a tolerable voice; I now turned what was once my amusement into a present means of subsistence.	Let him go on, let him go on, I say.	But this is a false compact; because no man has a right to barter his life any more than to take it away, as it is not his own.	The keeper of the prison entered, holding a man all bloody, wounded, and fettered with the heaviest irons.	(_Aside._) I see this fellow wants to give us his company, and  forgets that he's an inn-keeper, before he has learned to be a  gentleman.	I would be a king myself.	That there squire of renown, for whom I have a great friendship (but that's between ourselves) has often employed me in doing odd little things for him.	HONEYW.	How does he look now?—How does he look  now?	You all know your posts and your places;  and can show that you have been used to good company, without stirring  from home.	Well, go thy ways, Sir William Honeywood.	No, I'm to have no hand in the  disposal of my own children.	And yet Mrs. Niece thinks herself as much a woman, and is as  fond of jewels, as the oldest of us all.	"I beg, sir," returned she, scarcely able to speak, "that you'll desist, and not make me so very wretched."	She then proceeded to expatiate upon the sincerity of her son's passion; she set his duel with Mr. Thornhill in a proper light; from thence she made a rapid digression to the squire's debaucheries, his pretended marriages, and ended with a most insulting picture of his cowardice.	At his control  Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;  Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,  And his last faltering accents whisper'd praise.	TONY.	SCENE.—CROAKER'S _house_.	SIR WILL.	MISS HARD.	MRS. BULKLEY.	Have we not seen, round Britain's peopled shore,  Her useful sons exchanged for useless ore?	If the cakes at tea ate short and crisp, they were made by Olivia; if the gooseberry-wine was well knit, the gooseberries were of her gathering: it was her fingers which gave the pickles their peculiar green; and in the composition of a pudding it was her judgment that mixed the ingredients.	The waiter soon made his appearance with preparations for dinner; a table was lent us by the gaoler, who seemed remarkably assiduous; the wine was disposed in order, and two very well-dressed dishes were brought in.	[Illustration:   "_Walked along from city to city._"—_p._ 101. ]	I have gone through every receipt in the Complete  Huswife ten times over; and you have thoughts of coursing me through  _Quincy_ next spring.	Yet, why should I inquire,  when he alarms us in this manner almost every day?	Oh that this sight would break my heart at once, and let me die!"	Indeed!	The 'squire is going to  knock himself down for a song.	To be sure I loved to hear him talk, and he  loved to hear me talk; poor dear Dick!	_Enter_ HASTINGS.	What hope, but in being forgotten?	why, what should it mean, but what Mr. Lofty sent  you here to see?	"A very fine day, doctor; though I fancy we shall have some rain, by the shooting of my corns."	"I wish," cried I, "that such intruding advisers were fixed in the pillory.	I think I  know an incendiary's look; for, wherever the devil makes a purchase, he  never fails to set his mark.	Lovers are plenty, but fail to relieve me.	and never let me see thee again: go from my door!	LOFTY.	CROAKER.	Well, Mr. Croaker, I hope you now see how incapable this  gentleman is of serving you, and how little Miss Richland has to expect  from his influence.	Who copied his squibs and re-echoed his jokes;  Ye tame imitators, ye servile herd, come,  Still follow your master, and visit his tomb:  To deck it, bring with you festoons of the vine,  And copious libations bestow on his shrine;  Then strew all around it (you can do no less)  Cross-readings, Ship-news, and Mistakes of the Press.	"Sir," returned my companion, "the public think nothing about dialect, or humour, or character; for that is none of their business; they only go to be amused, and find themselves happy when they can enjoy a pantomime, under the sanction of Jonson's or Shakespeare's name."	Setting interest therefore aside, to which I never paid much attention, I must be indulged at present in following my affections.	I know at this  time no less than a hundred and twenty-seven Jesuits between  Charing-cross and Temple-bar.
