O fond pretence--   For both, for both my love is so immense,   I feel my heart is cut in twain for them."	O let me melt into thee; let the sounds   Of our close voices marry at their birth;   Let us entwine hoveringly--O dearth   Of human words!

Sleep yawned from underneath.	and when 'tis his,   After long toil and travelling, to miss   The kernel of his hopes, how more than vile:   Yet, for him there's refreshment even in toil;   Another city doth he set about,   Free from the smallest pebble-head of doubt                   150   That he will seize on trickling honey-combs:   Alas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,   And onward to another city speeds.

Endymion to heaven's airy dome   Was offering up a hecatomb of vows,   When these words reach'd him.	He bade a loth farewel   To these founts Protean, passing gulph, and dell,   And torrent, and ten thousand jutting shapes,   Half seen through deepest gloom, and griesly gapes,           630   Blackening on every side, and overhead   A vaulted dome like Heaven's, far bespread   With starlight gems: aye, all so huge and strange,   The solitary felt a hurried change   Working within him into something dreary,--   Vex'd like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,   And purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds.

Endymion feels it, and no more controls   The burning prayer within him; so, bent low,   He had begun a plaining of his woe.	At every onward step proud domes arose   In prospect,--diamond gleams, and golden glows   Of amber 'gainst their faces levelling.

Could I weed   Thy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer   All the bright riches of my crystal coffer   To Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,                        110   Golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,   Vermilion-tail'd, or finn'd with silvery gauze;   Yea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws   A virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands   Tawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands   By my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,   My charming rod, my potent river spells;   Yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup   Meander gave me,--for I bubbled up   To fainting creatures in a desert wild.	On gold sand impearl'd   With lily shells, and pebbles milky white,   Poor Cynthia greeted him, and sooth'd her light   Against his pallid face: he felt the charm   To breathlessness, and suddenly a warm   Of his heart's blood: 'twas very sweet; he stay'd   His wandering steps, and half-entranced laid   His head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,                     110   To taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,   Lashed from the crystal roof by fishes' tails.

Methought I lay   Watching the zenith, where the milky way   Among the stars in virgin splendour pours;                    580   And travelling my eye, until the doors   Of heaven appear'd to open for my flight,   I became loth and fearful to alight   From such high soaring by a downward glance:   So kept me stedfast in that airy trance,   Spreading imaginary pinions wide.	behold!"

Her eloquence did breathe away the curse:   She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse   Of happy changes in emphatic dreams,   Along a path between two little streams,--   Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,   From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow   From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;   Until they came to where these streamlets fall,   With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,                     420   Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush   With crystal mocking of the trees and sky.	120   But woe is me, I am but as a child   To gladden thee; and all I dare to say,   Is, that I pity thee; that on this day   I've been thy guide; that thou must wander far   In other regions, past the scanty bar   To mortal steps, before thou cans't be ta'en   From every wasting sigh, from every pain,   Into the gentle bosom of thy love.
