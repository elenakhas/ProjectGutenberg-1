"Look, you've got to help me.	"Cases like yours, for instance."	"Of course it was real fire!	"Let's go, Jeff," said Dr. Schiml.	Someone was coming down from above, down onto the top of the elevator; someone whose mind was filled with fear, but who moved with determination.	He'll survive, all right, unless we run into something mighty--" Conroe shook his head.	"Give him a minute's rest and reinforce the palamine.	Narcotics control was all shot to pieces during the war; heroin was all over the place.	Conroe jerked back with a cry, and then Schiml was on his feet as Jeff lunged again, his muscles tightening like bands of steel under the flimsy shirt.	Jeff leaned toward the girl, his voice hoarse.	And now, at last, nothing would go wrong.	The Nasty Frenchman nodded eagerly.	Then when things did get straightened out, we ran into the inflation, the burned-out crops, the whole rat-race.	Dr. Gabriel was back in a moment, and another needle nibbled Jeff's arm briefly.	At the end of the corridor he stepped onto the creaky, down-going escalator.	"We could both see the fire, but there was something else.	His eyes strayed once again to the curious cards, and the chill of fear went through him like a ghastly breeze.	"I'm not sure just what I want to volunteer for," he said cautiously.	If the guards had caught you at it, you wouldn't be alive right now--which would have been a dirty shame, since we have plans for you."	Her eyes pleaded with him.	"These dates must have some significance.	They've been after it for years; they start after it time after time, every time a new angle comes up.	Can't you see that?	It was impossible that Conroe could have been here at the times the dates indicated: ten years ago, when the Hoffman Center was hardly opened; five years ago, during the very time when Jeff had been tracking him down.	What could I lose?	Sometimes he wondered about it.	"That girl," he said finally.	I'm Roger Schiml, by the way.	We don't even understand fully the structure of the nervous system, much less understand its function.	I don't like the company."	Between the beds a door led into a compact lavatory and shower.	"Blackie, Blackie, think what you're saying.	"He haunts me, for years he's haunted me."	It read seven P.M.	One of them held a tiny, deadly scorcher pistol trained on his chest.	Jeff's face darkened angrily.	His face creased into a sardonic grin as he started for the door.	They played the same game night after night.	Look close.	But her eyes were troubled as she watched Jeff and lifted her coffee cup in mock salute.	Then again he punched the "Search" button.	So we hired men.	Schiml sat on the edge of a desk.	But those are the things we have to learn, Paul."	"What do you care what I do?"	Want me to take him right down?"	"Go on, throw them."	Any questions?	And the computor could take these patterns from the film and analyze them and compare them.	Jeff's eyes skimmed the letter briefly, catching words here, phrases there:   ... as director of research at the Hoffman Center, considered it my   duty to bring this unbelievable condition to the attention of higher   authorities....	Here was the answer to the whole tangled puzzle of the girl and Paul Conroe, of Dr. Schiml and the Mercy Men.	For one hundred and fifty thousand dollars."	"You've got a better chance of living sitting under an atom bomb, my friend.	But there are problems.	"A matter of business," he said, almost apologetically.	"That's just it: we've been in and we're going to be out, right out in the cold.	A twinge, the barest trace of shock, a sharp series of firing nerve cells, a flicker of light, a picture--Jeff Meyer shifted, his eyelids lowering very slightly, and a muscle in his jaw began twitching involuntarily...._        *       *       *       *       * He was floating gently on his back, resting on huge, fluffy, billowing clouds.	The dice rolled, fell into deadlock again, and the crowd around them gasped, moved in closer around them.	Remember when the guards brought me in here?	Schiml nodded gravely, adjusting the microvernier that controlled the probing instrument.	Can we play with the marbles now, Daddy?	It hasn't mattered enough.	A new sound was apparent, an unearthly sound of labored, gurgling breathing.	Cold beads of sweat stood out on his forehead as he waited, hearing the steps draw nearer.	None that I can see--yet."	His eyes caught Blackie's, far across the room, for the barest instant, and the chill of something gone wrong intensified and sent a quiver up his spine.	"You don't know Conroe?"	With trembling fingers, he typed out the coding, punched the tracer button and sat back, his heart thumping wildly.	The man shrugged, looking at him strangely.	It also referred to the investigation just concluded of possible disturbing elements in the analysis.	"The man is here.	It was Conroe's face.	All those things are beaten now, a thing of the past.	"That's right," he croaked.	"I know it, I know it.	But she wasn't the girl in the tavern.	All Jeff could do was to search the file rooms Blackie had directed him to.	Jeff's fingers sped over the coding board again, as he started coding in a description.	And then Shaggy Parsons was saying that the whole unit was being split up--that's the A unit.	"You got the wrong information," he said angrily.	Indeed, for the first time, the girl's face seemed softer.	And Daddy laughed and looked at him in a strange way and said, "Afraid?	"Oh, yes, with the dice--" The girl's eyes flickered for a moment.
