It was Drost Peter and his squire leaving the castle.	"Not I.	This Marsk Stig is a violent man, and singularly true to his word.	It was sad to look upon the man.	She was his wife, Skirmen; and thou hast conducted thyself like a brave fellow.	His forces consisted chiefly of South Jutlanders; although among them there were also a few Brandenburg and Saxon horsemen.	It is not so learned as your's; but that you also follow it, in the main, you have given me excellent proof, for which I have every esteem and honour."	The marsk became irritated, and reined in his steed; whilst the prisoner on the wall laughed aloud.	"Even your earthly judges," he added, "I hope to soften, after this your confession.	He owed, undeniably, to the queen's favour, his rapid rise from a simple knight to be drost of the kingdom; and, though it vexed him much, that he should, in consequence, be blamed as a fortunate adventurer, who had been raised to eminence through a woman's favour, these usual whisperings of envy were not of a nature to drown the voice of bold self-consciousness in his bosom.	The proximity of Drost Peter had redoubled the courage of his betrothed, although she feared that his co-operation with Rané might defeat the whole scheme.	The wily duke, however, seemed solicitous to conceal this from himself as well as from the knighthood, and, in a tone of easy dignity, he thanked the king for this gracious mark of distinction.	He rode on in silence, for some minutes, with unusual rapidity, but not inattentive to the king's angry looks and Drost Peter's uneasiness.	"That is brave!"	Drost Peter remained mute.	"Our young king is all too stern, in rejecting every petition on his behalf," sighed Aage.	he cried, "Your boat can never keep the sea."	Drost Peter paid no attention to his squire's announcement.	"They are not required," said Skirmen: "the darker the better.	Skirmen was abashed, and remained silent.	He approached the queen with as much ease and freedom as if he had already been for a long time her adviser, and the guardian of the young king.	A truer man there is not in Denmark, although he has almost as much injustice to complain of as have his kinsmen."	"Oh, yes!"	"Good!"	The illustrious fair one who, against her wish, brought us to contend against each other, shall hereafter, like a spirit of peace and reconciliation, unite our hands and hearts in that gloomy warfare wherein friends and foes know not each other.	"Pray be not angry, stern sir marsk," he muttered: "only hear the ballad out.	In these very serious times, it is certainly highly necessary that one should keep a fool to jest for him, when he can no longer jest himself.	"Confound him!	They cannot do otherwise than cross the brook."	Take Rane with thee, and compel him to lead thee in their track."	"Nothing is the matter with me," replied Skirmen, holding the stirrup for his master, "if nothing is the matter with yourself, or, perhaps, with the king.	He perceived the light bark speed like an arrow through the water, and gain upon the skiff with the blue and yellow sails, that conveyed Jomfru Inge.	The stillness of death reigned throughout the castle.	said the queen, with lofty dignity--"come you in person to hear your doom?	What I have to say to you at parting, I shall say aloud, before the whole world.	"Look once more.	"Nay, good sir!	The Swedish people will not better themselves by the bargain: for a weak and sensual, but a good-natured, and, at times, even a devout king, they have taken a strong and prudent, but a fierce and sanguinary tyrant.	Look to your own safety.	Such knowledge is never to be despised."	Now he is of age, and has become too strong for you: he is haughty and unmanageable, and you must beware how you hold out the rod to him.	Skirmen hastily brought the horses on shore; and, in an instant, the knights had mounted them, and the squire leaped on his hardy norback, when, without delay, the three horsemen proceeded through the slumbering town.	But proceed, without delay, to my warden at Harrestrup.	Her noble and beautiful figure reminded him, beyond all the women of Denmark, of her who was dearest to him; and, notwithstanding her simple dress, and the improbability of her being the Lady Inge, he remained, absorbed in reverie.	At the extremity of the quay lay a skiff, with red sails, upon which a number of silent figures were in motion.	"They must be very strict here," said the count, "when the drost himself must be reminded of the law.	exclaimed the marsk, riding up to her.	"See, there goes the algrev," said Sir Abildgaard: "he must certainly feel it hard to run from a Danish coast without booty.	"Were I in his place, I would set the eagle in the shield, instead of the red bend.	Drost Peter continued to gaze after the retiring skiff, on which he long fancied he could discern a lappet of Jomfru Inge's mantle; and sad, but wonderfully strengthened and inspirited by this fond adieu, he hastened on his necessary and appointed way.	*   *   * Many are the wonderful tales of swords in these old northern romances.	I have considered it closely, and no longer hesitate.	He must die: a noble-born knight deserves to be punished with tenfold severity, when found among robbers and highwaymen.	Neither of them used the point of the sword, but hewed with the sharp edge, and aimed only at the head and breast, or between the four limbs, as it is termed.	Such demonstrations of homage were most frequently got up by the crafty chamberlain, who sagaciously reckoned that, if these flatteries did not always obtain the king's applause, they seldom called forth his displeasure.	With these words, he left the room.	Fortunately, he has disappeared.	Rane, meanwhile, still stood undecided by the bench on which Jomfru Kirstine was seated, when Jomfru Inge and the others began to sing:--                   "Riber Ulf first dances here--                   A king is he without compeer."	"We shall never get out of the forest," he whimpered.	In his flight Odin informed him, that, as a punishment for having broken his compact, he should be slain by his meanest thrall.	One was in the dress of a huntsman, and the two others were clad as citizens on a journey; nevertheless, under their gray cloaks they had long swords, like those worn by knights.	This, in his name and by his princely soul, I dare swear to you, faithfully and piously."	Art thou here, prepared with these juggling grimaces?	One calm autumn evening, the vaadesang rose mournfully from the crypt under King Erik Christopherson's tomb, in Viborg Cathedral.	Rimaardson eyed the king with a melancholy look.	The jarl, however, had quarrelled with Halkell at the drinking-table, and killed him with a wine-stoup in the presence of the king.	Weariness, after unusual exertions, surprised me here for a moment.	muttered the jarl.	Such were the various suggestions that were loudly and rapidly uttered, but no one stirred to give them effect.	With wild shouts they tumbled among one another, and Drost Peter and Tygé alone fought with deliberation and security; but they were nearly overwhelmed, when a noise in the court and the sound of a horn were heard.	The terrified peasants crossed themselves, and repeated their paternosters; none doubting but that it was the Evil One himself whom they had seen.	exclaimed Aase, throwing her arms around him.	They happened to be riding side by side, when the chancellor turned to the duke, with an antiquarian remark, on the name and origin of the ancient city of Viborg, which he thought was derived from a certain Queen _Vebeca_, or from the Gothic people _Viti_, or, perhaps, with better reason, from its elevated position and ancient use as a place of sacrifice; or even from the heathen war-god _Vig_; and hence that the place had been originally called _Vigbierg_--the hill of Vig.	In one of these subterranean dungeons lay Sir Lave.	interrupted Thorstenson, in a low voice, as he was on the point of starting up.	Onwards."	"Now, by my soul!"	I fancied I heard you calling from the thicket, and sprang towards the sound: I then rushed wildly into the cursed elfin-moss, but could find no traces of the house."	observed his companion, with a smile.	And yet such a fellow brags of his princely descent, and scorns an honest and irreproachable knight!	"Look at the sand-glass, child: is it near midnight?"	Dorothy was carried sick to bed; and the sight which had operated so violently upon her, had also made a singularly painful impression on the other domestics.	If, as I hope, you accede to it, I may soon have the pleasure of opening this door for you altogether.
