They have this new miracle drug, senopoline.	"A miracle...." She threw her arms about him; they hadn't held each other since the accident a year ago, the accident that had snapped his spine in several places.	"For a minute there, I thought we were back at Finger Lake.	When he opened his eyes, he was surprised to find that the boat was a bed, the water only pelting rain against the window, and the willow trees long shadows on the walls.	He had never felt so well in his life; he was eager to put the strong springs of his muscles back into play.	"It was a drug, Andy.	"They took it off," Paula said tearfully.	"Seems to me Doc Bernstein was in here a while ago.	Swiftly, he put his hand on his rib cage and touched the firm flesh.	As First Secretary of the World Council, his ability to effect a working compromise between the ideological factions was directly responsible for the establishment of the World Government.	To make sure his superb playing wasn't a fluke, they returned to the club the next day.	Now he was a demon on the court, no ball escaping his swift-moving racket.	By the end of the first year of fighting, there were two silver stars on his shoulder and he was given the most critical assignment of all--to represent the Allies in the negotiations that were taking place in Fox Island in the Aleutians.	"The girdle," he said wonderingly.	But the decision wasn't necessary; by summer, the Asiatic Alliance had tired of the incessant talks with the peacemakers and had launched their attack on the Alaskan frontier.	At the end of the afternoon, his heart pounding to the beat of victory, he knew it was true.	Paula said.	Two years later, little Denise took over the hand-me-down cradle.	A month later, they were signing the documents that entitled them to a sprawling hilltop house in Westchester, with a north-light glassed-in studio the size of their former apartment.	Bernstein had made the usual speech about rest, but a week after his discharge Andy and Paula were at the courts in tennis clothes.	Paula's hands were resting gently on his eyes and he lifted them away.	"There," Bernstein sighed, "is the crux of the controversy, Mrs.	When she returned, her face was glowing with the heat of the fire and warmth of her news.	That night, with Paula in his lap, he stroked her long auburn hair and said: "No, Paula, it's all wrong.	"Andy," she said quietly.	It was there that Andy talked about his future.	Remember that night we sprang a leak?	It's strange stuff, as I said, but in the light of your husband's present condition, I can tell you this--it can do him absolutely no harm."	She pulled away from him and got up to stir the ashes in the fireplace.	Don't you remember?	Later, he denied that he was solely responsible for the successful culmination of the peace talks, but the American populace thought him hero enough to sweep him into the White House the following year in a landslide victory unparalleled in political history.	I'd like to keep it up, maybe enter the Nationals, but that's no life for me.	He won easily and was elected to the town council.	I'd like to try doing some commercial illustration; that's for the bread and potatoes.	He took his place behind the cluttered desk, his grave face distracted, and waited until she sat down in the facing chair.	I'll never forget the way you looked when you saw the hem of your dress."	About this drug of yours--" "We had to call you.	*       *       *       *       * When Andrew Junior was three, Andrew Senior made his most important advance in the field of art--not on the cover of the _Saturday Evening Post_, but in the halls of the Modern Museum of Art.	His gallantry in action, his brilliant recapture of Shaktolik, White Mountain, and eventual triumphant march into Nome guaranteed him a place in the High Command of the Allied Armies.	I'm not Presidential timber, Paula."	Andy was commissioned at once as a major.	She hesitated, then walked in.	Didn't they jab me again or something?"	By that time, Andy Hills was signing his name to the magazine covers of America's top-circulation weeklies, and they were happy to feature it.	I have a right to know!"	"But then you called me.	Paula, a junior champion during her college years, couldn't begin to cope with him; laughingly, she gave up and watched him battle the club professional.	"Painting?	He was thirty-five when the urge struck him to rectify a sordid political situation in their town.	"Andy, do you know what's happened?"	"At any rate, you're the only person in the world that can decide whether your husband receives it.	He had been twenty-two when it happened.	Oh, I don't mean I intend to stay in Wall Street; that's not my ambition either.	"Funniest damn thing," he said.	He sat up in bed, casually, as if sitting up in bed were an everyday occurrence.	Or was he?	That spring, he and Paula spent a month in Acapulco, in an enchanting home they had erected in the cool shadows of the steep mountains that faced the bay.	"Don't desert your wife and family for some Tahitian idyll...." "What family?"	I haven't cared about anything since Andy's illness."	He astounded himself with the accuracy of his crashing serves, his incredible play at the net.	They talked it over, excited as schoolchildren, all the way home.	His first exhibit evoked such a torrent of superlatives that the _New York Times_ found the reaction newsworthy enough for a box on the front page.	"I know what the party's planning," he told his wife, "but I know they're wrong.	Andrew Hills, Junior, was born in September.	He smoked reflectively for a moment, and then recalled that he hadn't been anything but horizontal for almost eight months.	Hills."	He was fifty by the time he left Washington, but his greatest triumphs were yet to come.	"I was always pretty good, you know that.	His added fame as America's top-ranked amateur tennis champion made the signature all the more desirable.	"Senopoline is a curious drug," he said.	This time, Andy found a former Davis Cup challenger to compete with.	Andrew Junior, with his four grandchildren, and Denise, with her charming twins, paid him one last visit before he took to his bed.	The office was a minor one, but he was enough of a celebrity to attract country-wide attention.	Senator.	At first, the idea of vote-seeking appalled him; but he couldn't retreat once the movement started.	"I've had little experience with it myself.	Still active and vigorous, still capable of a commanding tennis game, of a painting that set art circles gasping, he and Paula moved permanently into the house in Acapulco.	"Does it cure or what?	You think you can make a living at it?"	He took the first set 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, and Andy knew that something more magical than medicinal had happened to him.
