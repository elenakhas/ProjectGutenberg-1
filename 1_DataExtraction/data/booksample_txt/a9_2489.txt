This whole book is but a draught--nay, but the draught of a draught.	But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about him,--"Captain Bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go.	What is best let alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures.	Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.	Nor was this long wanting.	The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand.	I'll soon take that black from your brow.	It is time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong.	"What's the matter?	He lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri.	"Aye, and that's because the lid there's a sounding-board; and what in all things makes the sounding-board is this-- there's naught beneath.	"Sir?	This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the other.	(Right Whale).--In one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted by man.	"Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy."	"I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard," said Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan.	But the only thing to be considered here is this--what kind of oil is used at coronations?	I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do they fast on their hams that way in his native island.	But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself.	But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul.	Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow.	"'My wrist is sprained with ye!'	Three cheers, men--all hearts alive!	But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts sank in.	The rest contrived to escape for the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other craft than the Pequod.	But what was still more curious, Flask--you know how curious all dreams are--through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab.	never more to rise and blow.	Your cup!	The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved with Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles.	At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light.	Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals.	So the signal was set to see what response would be made.	"I don't know that, Stubb.	Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate, going in?	Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.	"I hold the spool, sir.	but 'tis not me!	The centre and circumference of all democracy!	D'ye see Ahab standing there, sideways looking over the stern?	But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply.	Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.	In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale.	They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.	turning to his comrades.	But we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it.	Oh!	But it is time to return to the Pequod.	There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct?	I promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty.	Oh--          We'll drink to-night with hearts as light,            To love, as gay and fleeting          As bubbles that swim, on the beaker's brim,            And break on the lips while meeting.	But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.	Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of the wake, and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings.	"Sing out for him!"	There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of Vendome stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below, whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.	Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn't he?'	"The rods!	But much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it.	air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks.	On one side, lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen.	And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel-- that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber.	Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present.	And that's the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore when I kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me.	Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.	His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion.	"Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad, that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that, don't you?	But there are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.	This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of.	the measure!"	Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array, something like those in the finest Italian line engravings.	Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature.	cried Starbuck; "he mocks and dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!"	This Rib (says John Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it.	CHAPTER 56 Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, &c. But I pass that matter by.	"Line!	here's Gemini himself, or the Twins.	At sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore; and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard--a cry and a rushing--and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea.	They meant Queequeg's best happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall.	Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called them ringbolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to them.	As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage.	It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw.	Pardon!'	This fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.	The mate there holds ye to it stiffly.
