"It was nice to meet you, Kurt," Alan said, and shook his hand.	They watched him until Easter break, when school let out and they disappeared back into the unknowable depths of their neat houses, and when they saw him on the street headed for a shop or moping on a bench, they cocked their heads quizzically at him, as if to say, *Do I know you from somewhere?	She followed the deep prints of his boots on the fresh snow, stalking him like he stalked rabbits in the woods.	Fast, lots of green lights.	They were cuddled together on the sidewalk, Kurt atop him, and Lyman and Sara bent to help them apart.	You said, 'Lost another one.'	Kurt visibly inflated.	Was he going to have to sit on Davey's shoulders until they were both old men?	That's good."	"Sure, why not.	Not a lot of free speech.	Kurt had gone outside to repark his old Buick, the trunk bungeed shut over his haul of LCD flat panels, empty laser-toner cartridges, and open gift baskets of pricey Japanese cosmetics.	She withdrew her hand.	Mimi.	Edward grimaced.	"Maybe you're part salamander.	I unwired the lamps and peered at the workings of the electric kitchen clock.	As Billy lay supine in the dirt, Alan heard a distant howl, not like a wolf, but like a thing that a wolf had caught and is savaging with its jaws.	The kid laughed and shook his head.	"Just listen."	Then he brushed against her bruised cheek and she startled, and that shocked him back to reality.	"Who knows about your wings?"	He found himself thinking of her standing in the tub, rolled towel between her teeth, as Krishna approached her wings with his knife, and he went back into the room to dress.	"You're my brothers," he said.	she said.	Alan tried to unfocus his eyes when he was in the front of Kurt's shop, to not see any of them too closely.	"So what?"	"I see," Mr. Davenport said.	"None of this would exist without you, you know."	# When Greg came home, Alan was waiting for him, sitting on the sofa, holding his head up with one hand.	Some recognition.	"How is that free speech?"	I grabbed it and ran back to our room and threw it out the window and started to get dressed."	When Kurt emerged from the front door of his storefront ten minutes later, he looked like he'd at least made an effort.	"Is there a spare?"	"I hate you, and I hate *him*," he cocked his head Alanward.	I did the only thing."	Waldo picked up his paper and pointedly read it, breathing heavily.	They started with a circuit of the house, looking for footprints, body parts.	"Sorry."	After his first birthday, David started taking breaks from his screaming, learning to crawl and then totter, becoming a holy terror.	They started walking now, Billy's limp more pronounced.	He brought it back downstairs and held it up for her to see.	Which they would have to do very soon, as he reminded them at every chance, unmoved by George's hangdog expression at the thought.	"Nice living room.	"Not today," Kurt said.	Oh, those we got.	"Where is she?"	"I told you," she said, not meeting his eyes, "he's not here."	They're all child molesters?"	And besides that, there was someone else who could see the vampires: Renfield.	It's a standard distro, I just copy it over, and biff-bam, it'll come right back up.	She said, 'Please.'	Alan gawped at it, taking it in, watching his miniature doppelganger, hardly bigger than the thumb it sprouted from, thrash like a worm on a hook.	It went in the night's stew.	These were the furry animals that the golems patiently trapped and killed, skinned, dressed, and smoked, laying them in small, fur-wrapped bundles in the family's cave when they were done.	"Pervert.	Was that him, there, in the shadows?	The cute redhead sprinkled a wiggle-finger wave at him, and he nodded at her, the tips of his ears going pink.	Alan said, after he'd taken hold of Davey's hair and, without fanfare, smashed his face into the cold stone floor hard enough to break his nose.	Ah.	"Such a beautiful smile," he said.	Kurt puffed up and gratefully socked the kid in the shoulder.	No.	My wings.	The winds blew colder, smelling now of the golem's side of the mountain, of clay and the dry bones of their kills, which they arrayed on the walls of their cavern.	Why not.	"We won't wake him."	"Well," Adam said.	She ignored him through the morning, and he couldn't find her at recess, but at lunch she came and sat next to him.	The breeze of her great wings was strangely intimate, that smell more intimate than his touches or the moment in which he'd glimpsed her fine, weighty breasts with their texture of stretch marks and underwire grooves.	He didn't do it.	The anarchist hustled around inside the shop, turning on lights, firing up the cash-register and counting out a float, switching on the coffee machine.	George looked an awful lot like Davey had, the day they killed him.	"I need to go home," he said.	Alan felt his own leg twist in sympathy, and then there was a killing rage in him.	I touched it.	"If you have a *lot* of these boxes in known locations with known nominal throughput, you can use them as a kind of sensor array.	Two babies in thirty days!	But this was just what he needed.	He was too heavy.	God, that's good.	She opened her eyes and looked at him, then closed them.
