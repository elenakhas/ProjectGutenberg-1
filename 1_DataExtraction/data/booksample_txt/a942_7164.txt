What a cursed sleep it was, O miserable me!	The sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade.	It is unholy--take not thy gifts through its unclean hands.	The works that I have in hand I will finish afterwards.	Then of a sudden thou didst hold out thy right hand and say 'What hast thou to give to me?'	Lord of my heart, no more shall there be for me waiting and weeping in corners, no more coyness and sweetness of demeanour.	The flower sweetens the air with its perfume; yet its last service is to offer itself to thee.	Yes, when the mother was a young girl it lay pervading her heart in tender and silent mystery of love--the sweet, soft freshness that has bloomed on baby's limbs.	The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song.	There is none to count thy minutes.	In the silence of gathering night I asked her, 'Maiden, your lights are all lit--then where do you go with your lamp?	My house is small and what once has gone from it can never be regained.	On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children.	At every footfall of yours, will not the harp of the road break out in sweet music of pain?	At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate to be shut; but I find that yet there is time.	Thus it is that thou hast come down to me.	The sky groans like one in despair.	No more noisy, loud words from me--such is my master's will.	With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep.	The child who is decked with prince's robes and who has jewelled chains round his neck loses all pleasure in his play; his dress hampers him at every step.	Men going home glance at me and smile and fill me with shame.	After the wedding the bride shall leave her home and meet her lord alone in the solitude of night.	No, it is no flower, nor spices, nor vase of perfumed water--it is thy dreadful sword.	Leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all, and never look behind in regret.	Where is this deliverance to be found?	I asked nothing from thee; I uttered not my name to thine ear.	They seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets.'	We quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by.	My eyes have seen and my ears have heard.	Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut?	If thou showest me not thy face, if thou leavest me wholly aside, I know not how I am to pass these long, rainy hours.	I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life.	Day after day I have kept watch for thee; for thee have I borne the joys and pangs of life.	I came out alone on my way to my tryst.	Mother, I shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck with my tears of sorrow.	Oh, dip my emptied life into that ocean, plunge it into the deepest fullness.	The air is still and silent about you.	The life breath of thy music runs from sky to sky.	My world will light its hundred different lamps with thy flame and place them before the altar of thy temple.	I was singing all alone in a corner, and the melody caught your ear.	What divine drink wouldst thou have, my God, from this overflowing cup of my life?	Ah, why do I ever miss his sight whose breath touches my sleep?	We sleepily thought it was the distant thunder.	I know not what this is that stirs in me--I know not its meaning.	I thought my invincible power would hold the world captive leaving me in a freedom undisturbed.	The great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky.	My companions laughed at me in scorn; they held their heads high and hurried on; they never looked back nor rested; they vanished in the distant blue haze.	I fear lest it droop and drop into the dust.	I am ever busy building this wall all around; and as this wall goes up into the sky day by day I lose sight of my true being in its dark shadow.	From dawn till dusk I sit here before my door, and I know that of a sudden the happy moment will arrive when I shall see.	Ah, what a kingly jest was it to open thy palm to a beggar to beg!	The time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long.	They called me and shouted, 'Come with us, the morning is wearing on to noon.'	He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground and where the pathmaker is breaking stones.	With the storm has come of a sudden our king of the fearful night.	Under thy great sky in solitude and silence, with humble heart shall I stand before thee face to face.	Away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite, and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil.	Thou givest thyself to me in love and then feelest thine own entire sweetness in me.	Pride can never approach to where thou walkest in the clothes of the humble among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.	Thy touch has not yet melted my vapour, making me one with thy light, and thus I count months and years separated from thee.	The light is shattered into gold on every cloud, my darling, and it scatters gems in profusion.	Yes, there is a rumour that a young pale beam of a crescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn cloud, and there the smile was first born in the dream of a dew-washed morning--the smile that flickers on baby's lips when he sleeps.	In pleasure and in pain I stand not by the side of men, and thus stand by thee.	And thus it is that time goes by while I give it to every querulous man who claims it, and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last.	O thou beautiful, there in the nest is thy love that encloses the soul with colours and sounds and odours.	Ornaments would mar our union; they would come between thee and me; their jingling would drown thy whispers.	But I find that thy will knows no end in me.	And today when by chance I light upon them and see thy signature, I find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten.	The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures.	Our day's works had been done.	Drunk with the joy of singing I forget myself and call thee friend who art my lord.	Give me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles.	But day passes by after day and thou art not seen.	Thou settest a barrier in thine own being and then callest thy severed self in myriad notes.	Is it only thou who wouldst stand in the shadow silent and behind them all?	'Prisoner, tell me, who was it that bound you?'	It is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself, and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune.	It is this sorrow of separation that gazes in silence all nights from star to star and becomes lyric among rustling leaves in rainy darkness of July.	When the warriors came out first from their master's hall, where had they hid their power?	The heaven's river has drowned its banks and the flood of joy is abroad.	I stood alone among tall grasses and watched the timid flame of her lamp uselessly drifting in the tide.	Many a man knocked at my door and asked for her and turned away in despair.	In my heart is the endless play of thy delight.
