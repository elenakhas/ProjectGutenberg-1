The body-guards, as if to satisfy their consciences, rushed through the throng of duellists, saying: "Gentlemen, gentlemen, be moderate!"	Yes," she went on, coloring and closely pressing the young Dauphin's arm, "yes, my brother, and you gentlemen, counsel me!	"I permit them to enter," said the Queen.	CHAPTER XVI THE CONFUSION This same morning, the various events of which we have seen in the apartments of Gaston d'Orleans and of the Queen, the calm and silence of study reigned in a modest cabinet of a large house near the Palais de justice.	It is odious; the sight, the smell, the ear, and the touch, above all, are too severely wounded by it," said M. du Lude, with a comical gravity.	But that lady had completely lost her self-possession, and, opening one of those immense ebony coffers which then answered the purpose of wardrobes, took from it a casket of the Princess's diamonds to save it, and did not listen to her.	The cavaliers, having gained a few scratches and lost a few purses, resumed their route by the side of the carriages along the by-streets; the others escaped, one by one, through the populace they had attracted.	An engraving arrested her attention.	In every direction challenges, insults, and imprecations were heard.	"It is not my fault," replied Gondi, in a sullen tone; "these idiots came an hour too late.	I have already told you so.	"I admit," continued Fontrailles, "that your Highness ordered nothing, but you permitted me to tell you that I foresaw that this night would be a troubled one about two o'clock, and I hoped that your astonishment would not have been too great."	He looked in the column of the month of December; and, finding at the fourth day of this month the name of Ste.-Barbe, he remembered that he had seen several small cannons and barrels pass, and, perfectly satisfied with the explanation which he had given himself, he hastened to drive away the interruption which had called off his attention, and resumed his quiet studies, rising only to take a book from the shelves of his library, and, after reading in it a phrase, a line, or only a word, he threw it from him upon his table or on the floor, covered in this way with books or papers which he would not trouble himself to return to their places, lest he should break the thread of his reveries.	I am ready to give you orders if it is necessary."	"What, Madame!	But take care of yourselves, Messieurs; some one comes from the Rue Saint-Honore."	A mirror, rounded at the top, which the ladies of our time would consider small and insignificant, stood in the middle of the table, whereon were scattered jewels and necklaces.	I am sure that you have been misled and deceived."	You will recognize him; he will be disguised as a master-mason, with a rule in his hand.	But as she did not answer, and trembled in every limb, this good and gentle Princess appeared not to perceive it; and, paying the greatest attention to the cries and movements of the populace, she even exaggerated an inquietude which she had not felt since the first name had reached her ear.	It is I who should be, and it is I who shall be, regent.	She saluted them.	She kissed her cheek, and resumed: "You do not suspect, my poor child, a sad truth.	And here a little man without a cassock, dressed as a soldier of the French guards, and wearing a very black false moustache, slipped between them.	I foresee it; but you will have subjects only, and no friends, for friendship exists only in independence and a kind of equality which takes its rise in force.	exclaimed the Queen, embracing Marie.	"Yes, of course.	He is master of the court at present.	And she added, with tears, "I have heard cries of death.	"You have been more courageous than any of us; you are attired fit to be seen by all the court."	But the noise, for a moment appeased, became general by reason of personal disputes.	"What is the matter with you?"	At this moment Madame de Guemenee arrived, a little more dressed than the Duchesse de Chevreuse, but taking events still more tragically.	"Yes," answered the Advocate; "really, between ourselves, Monsieur le Grand goes too far."	There is in his heart a great revolution going on; he would accomplish it, and can not.	The two friends asked nothing further, and were themselves surprised at their work.	You will have an absolute sceptre; but he has scattered the fasces which indicated it.	Before again beholding our personages, we must contemplate at large the state of the kingdom.	The revolutions in England, and those in Spain and Portugal, rendered the peace which France enjoyed still more admired.	"Must I remind you that I have almost adopted you for my eldest daughter?	The enchantment of the great nymph was complete on the Princess, who had hardly sufficient strength to find out with a trembling hand, toward the end of the book, that the Druid Adamas was an ingenious allegory, representing the Lieutenant-General of Montbrison, of the family of the Papons.	You are the daughter, the wife, and the mother of kings.	Then, raising the bed- curtains, she continued, addressing the two officers: "Gentlemen, first remember that you answer with your heads for the life of the princes, my children.	"No, Madame!	Her weary eyes closed, and the great book slipped from her lap to the cushion of velvet upon which her feet were placed, and where the beautiful Astree and the gallant Celadon reposed luxuriously, less immovable than Marie de Mantua, vanquished by them and by profound slumber.	Look at this tapestry, which represents Semele.	The future alone had changed its aspect.	"And in the evening, Madame, he left, ambitious."	Her terror inspired the Queen with a slight degree of fear, because of the ceremonious and placid character she was known to possess.	This was the beginning of our love, which, as you see, had its birth, as it were, between two tombs."	"Yet well you know," replied De Thou, "that I despise the first; and I deemed that you did not despise the second."	She would have lifted them; Anne of Austria stopped her.	If you could witness him thus, Madame, you would pity him.	behold,                And follow."	Most of them carried torches in their hands to light themselves and those they were about to attack.	"The Sainte-Barbe!"	what fear you, and what would you do?"	He at once applauds himself for his goodness as a Christian, curses himself for his weakness as a sovereign judge, despises himself as a king.	And he snatched up his crutch and quitted the room hastily, without listening to De Thou, who followed him to his carriage, seeking to pacify him, but without effect, because he did not wish to name his friend upon the stairs in the hearing of his servants, and could not explain the matter otherwise.	"Is it of Time you speak," said the Queen, "or of a real personage?"	"My brother," returned the Princess, energetically, "I take you at your word, for with you, one must do so; and I hope that together we shall be strong enough for the purpose.	I see but one."	"I will to-day wait on my sister-in-law at her toilette, and I will invite my brother to hunt the stag with me at Chambord."	"But the King has not loved him for two years; he loves another."	save me, protect me!	But we must allow that he deserves it.	"Perfectly; he is an excellent Royalist.	The signs of revolt and the evidences of terror became meantime more distinct.	"I have still another hand," said he, bowing and withdrawing with Guitaut.	He will do it, if you will assist him.	He was still thus when Montresor and Fontrailles at length arrived and found him beating his breast, and repeating a thousand times, "Mea culpa, mea culpa!"	The child, standing between the Queen's knees, looked at the men who surrounded him with a gravity very singular for his age, and, seeing his mother in tears, placed his hand upon the little sword he wore.	To-day I would descend into your heart, but I come too late to do you good."	I am prepared to expect anything from that man.	Heaven is my witness that I myself forgive him!"	Must I do more, Marie?	"You will admit with us that Monsieur le Grand is wrong?"	"Ah!	However, after a few minutes passed in this manner, a man, who appeared to come out of one of the vaulted doors of the Louvre, approached slowly, holding a dark- lantern, the light from which he turned upon the features of each individual, and which he blew out after finding the man he sought among them.	Her hair was in great disorder, and fell to her feet.	cried a shrill, piercing voice.	She was incessantly rearranging upon her forehead and her hair the rubies which ornamented her head, and which scarcely equalled the brilliancy and animated color of her complexion.	He would fain have said one word to him, only one word; but Cinq-Mars had already raised his head.
