Tedric assured him, quite truthfully.	More ... umm ... more priestess-like, say?"	"Aye," Phagon had chuckled in reply.	To that end I swear by my royal head, by the Throne, by Great Llosir's heart and brain and liver, that any man of whatever rank who slays or burns without my express permission will be flayed alive and then boiled in oil!"	The acolyte handed the pitcher to Trycie, who handed it to Tedric, who poured its contents over the twin hearts, twin livers, and twin brains.	From the south, the approach to this ford, lying just above (east of) the Low Umpasseur Mountains, at the point where the Middle Marches mounted a stiff but not abrupt gradient to become the Upper Marches, was not too difficult.	"'Tis what I would deserve, sire, or less; but no fear of that.	Much more so, methinks, than the Lady Rhoann.	"'Tis exactly as I saw him, sire," Tedric replied, firmly.	and the knights who could not hear him were made by signs to understand what was required.	First our king, then the Lady Priestess Trycie and her maids, then the Family, then the Court, then the rest.	This was the Amphitheater, and on the very lip of the stupendous cliff descending vertically to the river so far below, Llosir stood proudly on his platform of smooth, clean granite.	"'Twill save you rafts, sire, if he works with us.	"Mayst ask her sooner than that, if you like.	I tremble yet at the bare thought of what you did; I know not how you could have done it."	Unhelmed now, Tedric stood rigidly at attention before the image of his god.	High in the air directly over the forge the apparition hung, motionless and silent, and stared.	"Yea."	Also, sire, your father and your grandfather both died under Sarlonian axes."	"What!"	"Crave pardon, my lady, but other matters press...." "Your evasions are so transparent, my lord; why not tell the truth?"	First to his shop, where his armor was removed and where he scratched himself vigorously and delightfully as it came off.	"Tedric, I approve of you--you begin to think!"	And learning to be a riverman was so much easier than learning to be King Phagon's idea of a strategist!	There is no need to dwell in detail upon the army's long, slow march.	"NO BURNING AND NO WANTON KILLING!	The Throne can make and unmake nobility at will, but no power whatever can make true-bloods out of mongrels, nor create real _manhood_ where none exists!"	and he went on to tell a story of onslaught and slaughter.	"Trycie!"	Tedric yelled, above the clang of iron.	A little later, while the new-made Lord of the Marches was sleeping soundly, the king's messengers rode furiously abroad, spreading the word that ten days hence, at the fourth period after noon, in Lompoar's Amphitheater, Great Sarpedion would be sacrificed to Llosir, Lomarr's new and Ultra-powerful god.	"'Tis far too long to go into while I stand here half naked, filthy, and stinking.	Just outside the town's limit and some hundreds of feet above its principal streets there was a gigantic half-bowl, carved out of the solid rock by an eddy of some bye-gone age.	Hast honored me already far more than I deserved, or ever will.... Or, at least, at the moment ... there may be later, perhaps ... that is, a thing ..." he fell silent.	1.B.	She's seen everything and heard everything; knows more about everything than either of us, or both of us together.	Lady Rhoann was fast recovering her wonted cool poise.	"I have seen gold hammered into thin sheets ... but not thin enough ... but it might be possible to hammer it thin enough to be overlaid on the god-metal with pitch or gum.	"And now, in token of Sarpedion's utter and complete extinction, I consign these, the last vestiges of his being, to the rushing depths of oblivion."	None had.	Art in the forefront of those few I spoke of.	The city of Sarlo is here, on the north bank of the Sarlo River, right on the Bay, and is five-sixths surrounded by water.	"What thinkst you, Tedric, should be next?"	Then, swinging the burden up over his shoulder-- "I go to fetch the others," he explained to his king.	"The Lord of the Marches issues his own orders.	How much wine do _you_ drink, each day?"	"Three days will be ample, sire."	He was not the type to sit in idleness when there was something physical to do, something new to learn.	"Canst swim, Lord Tedric?"	Nor was the entrapment of most of the Sarlonians and barbarians on watch.	Tedric, strained and tense, was pounding carefully at a sheet of his latest production.	"Knowst how lost I my skill, Tedric?	And finally, much farther back, at a very respectful distance from their strange new god, arranged in dozens of more or less concentric, roughly hemispherical rows, stood everybody who had had time to get there.	"Llosir is not at all like Sarpedion.	"I hear, sire, and I obey."	"I fear me 'tis true, but 'tis impossible, nonetheless.

He whirled--and saw, shimmering in a cage-like structure of shimmering bars, a form of seeming flesh so exactly like the copper image in every detail of shape that it might well have come from the same mold!	"Aye, sire, but how couldst ..." "No matter.	"Yea.	See paragraph 1.C below.	The only surprise was Hurlo's death ... he had my direct orders not to do battle 'gainst any force, however slight-seeming, but to withdraw forthwith into the castle, which was to be kept stocked to withstand a siege of months ... this keeps me from boiling him in oil for stupidity, incompetence, and disloyalty."	See to it, my lord captain, that none sees this our trail from here to the Lake of the Spiders; or, having seen it, lives to tell of the seeing."	The rest of the Family--the Court--the thronging spectators--and, last of all, Tedric himself.	But this, too, was passed--by dint of what labor and stress it is not necessary to dwell upon--and as the army debouched out onto the sparsely-wooded, gullied and eroded terrain of the high barren valley and began to make camp for the night.	Lord Sciro, attend!"	Tedric, almost stunned by the novelty and audacity of this, the first amphibian operation in the history of his world, was dubious but willing.	Lomarr has never attacked Tark, whereas your royal sire and his sire before him each tried to loose Sarlon's grip and, in failing, but increased the already heavy payments of tribute.	Why?	Cross the Midvale at the ford three miles above us here.	Every mile gained, however, would be worth a century of men.	Phagon asked.	"Dreegor!"	And as the map of that operation spread itself in his mind, he grew enthusiastic.	Stupid I may be, but disloyal?	'Twas no raid, but the first skirmish of a war.	'Tis why we go up the Midvale, where farmsmen all breed savage dogs to guard their fields 'gainst hordes of game.	While 'tis not seemly that Lomarr's king should beg, I ask that you abandon us not."	I crave pardon for not attending to it sooner.	Then he spoke--not softly, but in parade-ground tones audible to everyone present.	"You feared the god, Lady Rhoann, as do so many.	In little over a minute it reached the pavilion and its terribly surprised owner.	Phagon was lecturing from a large map, using a sharp stick as pointer; Tedric, Sciro, Schillan, and two or three other high-ranking officers were watching and listening.
