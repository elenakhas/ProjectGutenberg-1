[Castle Douglas is a thriving Galloway village: it was in other days called "The Carlinwark," but accepted its present proud name from an opulent family of mercantile Douglasses, well known in Scotland, England, and America.]	As the sex have served many a good fellow, the Nine have given me a great deal of pleasure, but, bewitching jades!	Fintray, my stay in worldly strife,     Friend o' my muse, friend o' my life,                       Are ye as idle's I am?	No one concerned seemed to think so.	--second fill;       But not to those whom we love;     Lest we love those who love not us!--       A third--"to thee and me, love!"	Wildly here without control,     Nature reigns and rules the whole;       In that sober pensive mood,     Dearest to the feeling soul,       She plants the forest, pours the flood;     Life's poor day I'll musing rave,     And find at night a sheltering cave,     Where waters flow and wild woods wave,         By bonnie Castle-Gordon.	What are you doing, and how are you doing?	(It soothes poor misery, hearkening to her tale,)     And hear him curse the light he first survey'd,     And doubly curse the luckless rhyming trade?

There Simmer first unfauld her robes,       And there the langest tarry;     For there I took the last farewell       O' my sweet Highland Mary.	_Ben_, into the spence or parlour.	I wanted _un b√ªt_, which is a dangerous, an unhappy situation.	_Guid-mornin'_, good-morrow.	Farming CVII.	The language in which those great bards embodied their thoughts was unapproachable to an Ayrshire peasant; it was to him as an almost foreign tongue: he had to think and feel in the not ungraceful or inharmonious language of his own vale, and then, in a manner, translate it into that of Pope or of Thomson, with the additional difficulty of finding English words to express the exact meaning of those of Scotland, which had chiefly been retained because equivalents could not be found in the more elegant and grammatical tongue.	I am gratified with your kind inquiries after Jean; as, after all, I may say with Othello:--     --------------------"Excellent wretch!

THE BATTLE OF SHERIFF-MUIR.	Could _anything_ estrange me from a friend such as you?--No!

B.	coward!	II.	The following anecdote, which I had from the present Sir William Cunningham of Robertland, who had it of the late John, Earl of Loudon, I can, on such authorities, believe: Allan Ramsay was residing at Loudon-castle with the then Earl, father to Earl John; and one forenoon, riding or walking, out together, his lordship and Allan passed a sweet romantic spot on Irvine water, still called "Patie's mill," where a bonnie lass was "tedding hay, bare-headed on the green."	I do not mean any compliment to my ingenuousness, or to hint that the defect is in consequence of the unsuspicious simplicity of conscious truth or honour: I take it to be, in some, why or other, an imperfection in the mental sight; or, metaphor apart, some modification of dulness.	_Whase_, _wha's_, whose--who is.

Cromek thinks that the person addressed was the "Peggy" of the Common-place Book.	"I'll wed another, like my dear       Nancy, Nancy;     Then all hell will fly for fear,       My spouse, Nancy."	[A snatch of an old strain, trimmed up a little for the Museum.]	When I talk of poetic efforts, I must have it always understood, that I appeal from your wit and taste to your friendship and good nature.

The rough burr-thistle, spreading wide       Amang the bearded bear,     I turn'd the weeder-clips aside,       An' spar'd the symbol dear:         No nation, no station,           My envy e'er could raise,         A Scot still, but blot still,           I knew nae higher praise.	*       *       *       *       * CLV.	TO DR. BLACKLOCK.	Whose strong right hand has ever been       Their stay and dwelling place!	Ye'd better taen up spades and shools,                       Or knappin-hammers.	We lived very poorly: I was a dexterous ploughman for my age; and the next eldest to me was a brother (Gilbert), who could drive the plough very well, and help me to thrash the corn.	_Doucely_, soberly, prudently.	My best leg foremost, I'll set up my brow,     We have the honour to belong to you!	Let me wander where I will,     By shady wood, or winding rill;     Where the sweetest May-born flowers     Paint the meadows, deck the bowers;     Where the linnet's early song     Echoes sweet the woods among:     Let me wander where I will,     Laura haunts my fancy still.	_Chuckie_, a brood-hen.	Ritson's Scottish Songs.	Nor were his new labours more acceptable to his haughty spirit than those of the plough: the excise for a century had been a word of opprobrium or of hatred in the north: the duties which it imposed were regarded, not by peasants alone, as a serious encroachment upon the ancient rights of the nation, and to mislead a gauger, or resist him, even to blood, was considered by few as a fault.	_Stown_, stolen.	But ere the key-stane she could make,     The fient a tail she had to shake!	On lofty aiks the cushats wail,     And Echo cons the doolfu' tale;     The lintwhites in the hazel braes,     Delighted, rival ither's lays:     The craik amang the clover hay,     The paitrick whirrin o'er the ley,     The swallow jinkin round my shiel,     Amuse me at my spinning-wheel.	My vicinity to Ayr was of some advantage to me.	[Footnote 113: Gordon of Balmaghie.]	I am at this moment "holding high converse" with the muses, and have not a word to throw away on such a prosaic dog as you are.	The grave I shall cast into the usual division of those who are goaded on by the love of money, and those whose darling wish is to make a figure in the world.	WRITTEN AT INVERARY.	Reflections on religion CLXVIII.	To the Editor of the Star.	This day, Time winds th' exhausted chain,     To run the twelvemonth's length again:     I see the old, bald-pated follow,     With ardent eyes, complexion sallow,     Adjust the unimpair'd machine,     To wheel the equal, dull routine.	*       *       *       *       * CLV.	O wha can prudence think upon,       And sic a lassie by him?	He gave us the Vision; perhaps, he dared not in those yeasty times venture on the song, which his secret visitant poured from her lips.	I am getting my phiz done by an eminent engraver, and if it can be ready in time, I will appear in my book, looking like all other _fools_ to my title-page.	You shall have your choice of all the unpublished poems I have; and had your letter had my direction, so as to have reached me sooner (it only came to my hand this moment), I should have directly put you out of suspense on the subject.	Alison.	Thou paints auld nature to the nines,     In thy sweet Caledonian lines;     Nae gowden stream thro' myrtles twines,                       Where Philomel,     While nightly breezes sweep the vines,                       Her griefs will tell!	The great Creator to revere       Must sure become the creature;     But still the preaching cant forbear,       And ev'n the rigid feature:     Yet ne'er with wits profane to range,       Be complaisance extended;     An Atheist laugh's a poor exchange       For Deity offended!	Till Robert, the Lord of the Cairn and the Scaur,     Unmatch'd at the bottle, unconquer'd in war,     He drank his poor godship as deep as the sea,     No tide of the Baltic e'er drunker than he.	It had other attractions than good liquor; there lived "Anna, with the golden locks."]	Then hey for a lass wi' a tocher,       Then hey for a lass wi' a tocher;       Then hey for a lass wi' a tocher,         The nice yellow guineas for me.	_Cheek for chow_, close and united, brotherly, side by side.	I've seen me daezt upon a time;     I scarce could wink or see a styme;     Just ae hauf muchkin does me prime,                       Ought less is little,     Then back I rattle on the rhyme,                       As gleg's a whittle.	Sweet flow'ret, pledge o' meikle love,       And ward o' mony a pray'r,     What heart o' stane wad thou na move,       Sae helpless, sweet, and fair!
