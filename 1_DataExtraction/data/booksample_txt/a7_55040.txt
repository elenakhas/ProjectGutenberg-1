I think that big crown, on the top of his wig, must be _very_ heavy and uncomfortable.	So she wandered away, through the wood, carrying the ugly little thing with her.	All these things were happening just as Alice went in.	And I’m sure it was _very_ lucky she didn’t meet the real Mary Ann, as she trotted upstairs: for I’m afraid she would have taken Alice for a robber!	And then _perhaps_ the Queen won’t find out it was a _white_ rose-tree to begin with: and then _perhaps_ the little men won’t get their heads cut off!	But all the doors were locked: so, you see, poor Alice couldn’t get out of the hall: and that made her very sad.	And just look at her _smile_!	The right word is “_Folk’s_-Gloves.” Did you ever hear that Fairies used to be called “the good _Folk_”?	Then we’ll go on.	[Illustration] So this time the Cat vanished quite slowly, beginning with the tail, and ending with the grin.	[Illustration] So Alice said “Stuff and nonsense!” So the Queen said “Off with her head!” (Just what she always said, when she was angry.)	All alone, all alone!	But don’t _you_ try to hold on to a Baby like that, my Child!	But if you were fast asleep, like the Dormouse, you wouldn’t feel it: so I suppose you wouldn’t care about it.	That’s the March Hare, with the long ears, and straws mixed up with his hair.	And she can see the bad Knave (do you see the chains hanging from his wrists?)	However, after a little while, she came to a little table, all made of glass, with three legs (There are _two_ of the legs in the picture, and just the _beginning_ of the other leg, do you see?	The next thing was, Alice woke up out of her curious dream.	Did you ever play at Croquet?	“Mary Ann!” he said.	She can see the dish of tarts on the table, that she had taken such trouble to make.	And then the Dodo said _everybody_ had won, and _everybody_ must have prizes!	So Alice said “Who cares for _you_?	Oh, _won’t_ she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” But he didn’t see Alice, you know.	There are large wooden balls, painted with different colours, that you have to roll about; and arches of wire, that you have to send them through; and great wooden mallets, with long handles, to knock the balls about with.	The soup was boiling.	Do you feel quite good-natured again?	The Baby was howling.	But at last she found out that the _proper_ way was, to keep tight hold of its left foot and its right ear.	But Alice happened to have one of her feet in the fire-place: so, when she heard Bill coming down the chimney, she just gave a little tiny kick, and away went Bill, flying up into the sky!	And the Rabbit was dreadfully frightened: and he dropped the gloves and the fan, and ran away as hard as he could go.	It looks just like the sea, doesn’t it?	So we had to put it all down its throat with a spoon!” I wonder if Alice will give _this_ little Puppy some porridge?	(First published in 1872.)	So we said ‘Let’s give Dash a nice birthday-treat, like what we have on _our_ birthdays!’ So we thought and we thought ‘Now, what is it _we_ like best of all, on _our_ birthdays?’ And we thought and we thought.	And then _such_ a curious thing happened to her!	[Illustration] The door opened inwards: so of course there wasn’t any room to open it: so when the Rabbit got tired of waiting, and came to fetch his gloves for himself, of course he couldn’t get in.	And what did Alice and the Caterpillar _talk_ about, I wonder?	[Illustration] What funny little men they are!	[Illustration] Let’s try if we can make out all the twelve.	You see it’s got its price marked on it----a “10” and a “6”----that means “ten shillings and sixpence.” Wasn’t that a funny way of selling hats?	“Would you tell me which way I ought to go from here?” And so the Cheshire-Cat told her which way she ought to go, if she wanted to visit the Hatter, and which way to go, to visit the March Hare.	So Alice was very glad to run away, while it wasn’t looking.	So Alice put it down, and let it trot away into the wood.	And she told it she didn’t _like_ it coming and going so quickly.	So what do you think they did?	She could just manage, by putting her head down, close to the ground, to _look_ through with one eye!	_The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts:         All on a summer day:     The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,         And took them quite away!_” Well, yes, the _Song_ says so.	[Illustration] However, she soon came to a great mushroom, that was so tall that she couldn’t see over the top of it without standing on tip-toe.	First, you must have a _racecourse_.	VII.	So of course she set to work and ate it up.	So I suppose his plate and the milk-jug are hidden behind that large tea-pot.	She was worse off than ever, poor thing!	So, when she began to say “If you please, Sir----” her voice seemed to come from the top of the hall, because her head was so high up.	[Illustration] Now look at the picture, and you’ll soon guess what happened next.	THE DEAR LITTLE PUPPY.	Con 42 Vignette di GIOVANNI     TENNIEL.	Why, her skirt caught against the Jury-box, and tipped it over, and all the poor little Jurors came tumbling out of it!	However, after a bit, she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter: only I don’t quite see where she _got_ the bread-and-butter: and she had no plate for it.	No crossness about the corners of the mouth?	And is this a strange letter to find in a book of nonsense?	So all these creatures, Alice and all, went on running round and round, till they were all quite dry again.	Thus, forgetting tricks and play       For a moment, Lady dear,     We would wish you, if we may,       Merry Christmas, glad New Year!	Doesn’t Alice look very prim, holding her head so straight up, and with her hands behind her, just as if she were going to say her lessons to the Cat!	Don’t you pity him very much?	WHO STOLE THE TARTS?	So Alice set off, to visit the March Hare.	That creature with a red head, and red claws, and green scales, is the _Gryphon_.	No temper-ache?	There was a nice green arm-chair at the end of the table, that looked as if it was just meant for Alice: so she went and sat down in it.	“Go home this very minute, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!	With Forty-two Illustrations by     TENNIEL.	If you can’t, I’ll tell you.	Mr. Tenniel says the screaming bird is a _Storkling_ (of course you know what _that_ is?)	_Now_ ca’n’t you guess what the poor little gardeners are trying to do?	“Do you know, one day we remembered it was Dash’s birthday that day.	Isn’t Alice just a _little_ shy of it?	(Now we come to the picture).	She grew, and she grew, and she grew.	To call her Baby a _Pig_, and to want to chop off Alice’s head!” Oh, that was only a joke, about chopping off Alice’s head: and as to the Baby----why, it _was_ a Pig, you know!	You’re nothing but a pack of cards!” So they were _all_ very angry, and flew up into the air, and came tumbling down again, all over Alice, just like a shower of rain.	And hasn’t he got a beautiful neck-tie on?
