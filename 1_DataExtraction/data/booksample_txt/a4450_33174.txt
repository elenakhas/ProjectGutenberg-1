They described its rule and estimated its population, one author, with how much belief I know not, detailing the names of seventy-two of its princes with 7,405,926 devils serving them.	Not a bit of it.	Englishmen who realise this must have noticed with apprehension the growth of suspicion as a principle in recent years.	Nor was Dr Johnson less concerned with thumping the cushion in the matter of literature than in the matter of morals.	It is the same with mustard.	This is an unfair advantage to take of the ordinary maker of good resolutions.

Newby      Chief Executive and Director      gbnewby@pglaf.org Section 4.	Even here, however, one knows that it is against the interests of the State and of the race that we should admit the right to kill.	Oh,      my friends and fellow-countrymen, the slaves of an      iron-handed and a grinding despotism!	We do not want to be taught our A B C over again by having the alphabet burned into our flesh with a red-hot iron.	Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.	'Tis plain you were a cook in life----        (THE COOK _slips from his grasp_.)	There are moods of false exaltation in which the confession that one has broken a commandment seems to add an inch to one's stature.	He is like a man who would go before Parliament, when it was discussing some big project like the nationalisation of the railways and deny its right to legislate on such a matter till it had passed a measure forbidding the sticky sort of fly-papers.	You can catch your English railway-director with a single policeman; you may not be able to catch your foreigner without an international war.	It would be folly however to prophesy a world from which disaster has disappeared on the heels of the mastodon.	I will refuse to believe in them till I hear that one of them has run away from her husband to take one of those sinecures advertised in the domestic service columns of the _Morning Post_.	That is why, heartily as I love politicians, I would keep them on a chain.	Her new fashions are but an item in the general rejoicing over the infinite resurrections of Nature.	But when there is no doubt, let them be given the benefit of the policeman.	Similar chants of number are known in all religions.	Burke, Scott, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Macaulay, Carlyle, Thackeray, Ruskin, Matthew Arnold, Swinburne, Pater, Meredith, Stevenson--I choose more or less at a hazard a list of imaginative writers who are in the very mid-stream of English criticism.	Being shocked is a maker of revolutions and literatures when men are shocked by the right things--or, rather, by the wrong things.	At the same time, I cannot let the festival pass without recanting my childish insolence towards the holly and the mistletoe.	Mr Wells, in _The Passionate Friends_, offers a defence of the conventions by which Society attempts to reduce us all to a common pattern.	It is no small thing to have this upsetting of the tyrannies, if it is only for a few hours.	Husbands suspect their wives of trying to poison their beer; friends suspect friends of planning the most extraordinary series of losses and humiliations for them.	Obviously, in a country where hundreds of thousands of people are living on the edge of starvation--and over it--even a slight rise in the cost of things might produce the most calamitous results.	Every laurel puts forth new leaves like little green flames.	Who is there, even among Mr Bernard Shaw's detractors, who would wish his dramatic criticisms unwritten?	John Bright defended adulteration because he was a manufacturer.	But resolutions of this magnitude belong rather to the region of day-dreams.	It was not that one wanted to be unhappy.	Ornament, they may contend, especially in woman's dress, is simply mannikin's vainglory.	Probably in the beginning the sea-beast made no distinction of sex among its victims.	For most of us, however, the sea is a domesticated wonder.	It is an extraordinary fact that thousands of people can be serious to the point of bad temper over a political argument or a game of cards or tennis; but if you asked them to take a book seriously, they would regard the prospect as worse than a dry pharyngitis.	Others were gnawed by worms or dragged with hooks, or hung on gallows, or "soaked in baths of pitch and brimstone with a horrible stench," and, if they tried to escape, "the devils that met with them beat them sorely with scourges and forks and other kinds of torments."	He made himself as familiar with death as he was with the sun or his neighbours.	The realists indeed have brought the remedial imagination to us as the sociologist has brought the remedial facts and figures.	If it were not so, we should probably be as shocked as anyone else--those of us, that is, who are old-fashioned enough to consider murder and adultery as on the whole reprehensible.	The dressmaker's living depends on her keeping off Epicurus with one hand and the Twelve Apostles with the other, and she has certainly done so with the most brilliant efficiency.	With the warning of the cheerful theatre before us, then, it would be the stupidest folly to pay any heed to the new plea for cheerful books.	Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.	Suspicion is the arch-calumniator.	Many who are now living have had the night-fears of their childhood made monstrous with stories of devils with red-hot pincers to tear one's flesh and with red-hot nails to lacerate one's back.	But the black god one could not trust, and so one had to buy his goodwill.	It may be retorted, on the other hand, that murder was not condoned in the case either of Cain or of Orestes, and there are many other examples of guilty murderers in the heroic age.	Believers in omens tell us that, some time before Laud's trial and execution, he found his portrait fallen on to the floor, and predicted disaster; and they ask us to admit that this was more than a coincidence, especially as there are a hundred similar stories.	If your uncle danced down Piccadilly dressed like a Chinaman, your sense of propriety would be more outraged than if he appeared in the Divorce Court, since, bad as the latter is, it is less bewilderingly abnormal.	Export that for a few pieces of blood-money delivers up old and faithful servants to wretchedness."	It is a passion that is as universal as lying, and a good deal older than drinking.	It becomes amusing only when the other disputants, instead of confessing their ignorance, make a pretence of being acquainted with the invented quotations.	Statistics, of course, is largely concerned, like the arts, with the disharmonies of life, but it deals with them in terms of harmony.	I do not mind how many sins a man is angry with provided they include the sins he is addicted to himself and that are at his own door.	Probably it is a little of both.	And then, to crown everything, comes the parade of mannequins wearing the latest fashions in women's dress, or what will be the latest fashions in another month or two.	It is a schoolboyish plea for the revival of the tomahawk.	General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works 1.A.	The idea that modern men's clothes are ugly is a deception chiefly maintained by advertisement agents and shopkeepers.	The Bishop unfortunately had no theory with him.	They tell us that the critics attacked the Pre-Raphaelites, but they forget that Ruskin was a critic and a prophet of the Pre-Raphaelites.	My heart would bleed   To see Thee sit here in so poor weed,       With no pennies.	Similarly, with individual men and women.	We are hungry animals before we are poetical animals, and we are often praising the promise of our food when we seem to be most exalted in our raptures.	Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg: 1.E.1.	Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change.	I think there is.	One is usually consoled by the leader-writers, after a disaster has taken place, by the reflection that it has taught us certain lessons that will never, never be forgotten.	William Morris himself might have had that vision of restoring Cheapside to green fields, and even the extremest Marconoclast could hardly go further than Cade in suggestions for a summary way with lawyers.	One feels justified, then, in claiming for the maker of good resolutions a place in the sun.	Idleness, it does not take a Sunday-school teacher to see, is the universal dressmaker, and a woman who is not allowed to work and does not drink and has not even a vote is driven among the mannequins as surely as if you forced her there by law.	I went downstairs and put my hat on to go out and look for it, and had hardly opened the door, when in walked a little black kitten with bright eyes and its tail in the air.	Not a woman or child is injured, according to the verdict of a judge on the bench, but the Ulster Unionists, armed to the teeth with indignation in advance, denounce the affair as though it were on the same level of villainy with the September Massacres.	These are the substitute for the angels and devils of our grandfathers.	It is to be feared, however, that few hoaxers or murderers can be named who pursued their hobby in the disinterested spirit of artists.	Literature is not primarily meant to cheer us up when we are too tired to read the paper, though incidentally it often does so, and to despise this kind of literature would be as sinful as to despise Christmas pudding and brandy sauce.	It is one of the happy paradoxes of human conduct that, in spite of this vision of futilities, Anatole France came forward at the Dreyfus crisis as a man of action, a man who believed that the procession of absurdities could be diverted into a juster road.	Describing his sensations on first seeing his wife waltzing, Mr Hornem says:--      Judge of my surprise ... to see poor Mrs Hornem with her arms      half round the loins of a huge hussar-looking gentleman I      never set eyes on before; and his, to say truth, rather more      than half round her waist, turning round, and round, and      round, to a d----d see-saw, up-and-down sort of tune, that      reminded me of the "Black joke."	Office, he knows, is as perilous a gift as riches, and the temptation to be a tyrant, if it is only in a committee room down a side street, has destroyed men who stood out like heroes against drink and the flesh and gold.	Only the most innocent optimist can believe that sweating, for instance, can be put an end to by public opinion in the abstract as effectively as it can be stopped by public opinion acting through the police.	They are signs to us that we must not live merely to ourselves, but that we must in some way identify ourselves with the larger self of human society.
