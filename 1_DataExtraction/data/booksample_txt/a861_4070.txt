The large parcels will be sent later on.	HILDA.	HILDA.	Hard enough for me; but ten time harder for Aline.	KAIA.	And what is that?	Is it you--yourself, that your are talking about, Aline?	Well, that was better fun than to sit there knitting stockings with all those old women.	SOLNESS.	And they can sit and look in upon me from their windows.	The fight I have been fighting has cost heart's blood enough.--And I am afraid, too, that the helpers and servers will not obey me any longer.	Now you are standing there again like a statue; just as you stood last night.	For that among other things.	[With a little snort of contempt.]	But you have been---- [To RAGNAR.]	DR. HERDAL.	DR. HERDAL.	DR. HERDAL.	Tell me at once!	Oh yes, certainly.	SOLNESS.	SOLNESS.	Yes, but people might take it into their heads that you were mad too, you see.	But wait a moment--!	Then you admit it now?	Call me what you will.	Don't you agree with me, Hilda, that there exist special, chosen people who have been endowed with the power and faculty if desiring a thing, craving for a thing, willing a thing--so persistently and so--so inexorably--that at last it has to happen?	That I should come back to your home, and take you away with me?	[Rises slowly.]	HILDA.	[Looking at him.]	SOLNESS.	MRS. SOLNESS.	You surely cannot mean to deny it?	HILDA.	MRS. SOLNESS.	But he will not do it.	[Looks fixedly at him, and says in a low voice:] Because I seem to find a sort of--of salutary self-torture in allowing Aline to do me an injustice.	MRS. SOLNESS.	What is so terrible?	The longing to see you great.	[BROVIK and RAGNAR go out by the hall-door.	HILDA.	[HILDA seats herself in the corner of the sofa.	Tall old trees in the   garden spread their branches over the verandah and towards   the house.	SOLNESS.	A railing along the verandah to the right.	SOLNESS.	[With a groan.]	And that is why I am going away.	MRS. SOLNESS.	Yes, I suppose I ought to.	You must not!	And found some flowers too, I see.	SOLNESS.	SOLNESS.	I promised the foreman I would.	HILDA.	No, goodness knows, I don't understand at all-- SOLNESS.	HILDA.	And so you think it time there were an end of it.	SOLNESS.	HILDA.	Was he not cheered by what I wrote?	HILDA.	[Pushing the rocking-chair nearer and sitting down.]	Yes, indeed!	Ah, she is so good--so kind--so excellent a creature-- HILDA.	Ought I to have thanked him?	And make a princess of you?	[Looks doubtfully at her.]	Poor Aline!	RAGNAR.	Oh, but this is hopeless, hopeless!	KAIA.	KAIA.	[Evasively.]	SOLNESS.	Both old and new.	Were you alone?	[With a sudden outburst.]	HILDA.	[Vehemently.]
