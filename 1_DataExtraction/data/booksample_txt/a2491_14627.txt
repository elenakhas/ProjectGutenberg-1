Dietrich puts in more money every time.	Veronica sat quietly down by the bedside, and did what she could to soothe and refresh her, and when by degrees her mother's mind became more clear, she proposed to her to send for the doctor.	He is alone in the world.	Go ask Dietrich; he has his pockets full, and a big heap besides.	As he spoke he tossed away first the mended boots, then the hammer, and last of all the three-legged stool, away, as far as he could throw them, down into the meadow.	Yes, Veronica, I can assure you that I am now a happy woman, with a heart filled with gratitude to the good God for the blessings he has sent me.	Suddenly, such a happy radiance spread over her face, that Blasi stood still and gazed at her.	Gertrude did not pretend to understand the business, but she saw that Dietrich believed it to be safe and profitable, and she knew that her son would not deceive her.	Our Savior shows us the way to our Heavenly Father, and will help us to overcome all the difficulties that stand in our path.	Veronica had listened attentively to all that Gertrude had said.	Veronica sobbed as if the long-pent-up agony of her heart would never again submit to be restrained.	Now you have told me enough.	It always seems to me strange that while all babies in the cradle look just alike, so that you can't tell them apart, they grow up to be such very different men and women."	She took up the bag again, stitched up the last hole, and folded the work.	"Dietrich from Tannenegg," said the servant.	It is not like you.	Gertrude mounted wearily to her room as if her last day was come.	"You summoned me, or I should not have come;" said the young man, half in excuse, and half reassuringly, for Veronica stood dumb and motionless before him.	"I don't know about that," said Jost, "but now listen to me.	Blasi was fairly out of patience.	"The address is not very nicely written," he said.	The two were often seen standing before his house in the open street, gesticulating vehemently with hands and arms.	There the noise was increasing every minute, for the cattle-dealer had discovered that his money-bag was gone, and red-head screamed out like a mad-man, that nobody must get away, and everybody must be searched.	It was curious to see how differently the two women nearest to Dietrich were affected by this trouble.	Run after them!	You must live to be happy, mother!"	"Those are two uncommon children that the good God has confided to your care, and I feel the greatest interest in them.	But if he did not come, what then?	But she did not accept the offer; she could not leave her mother alone in this time of trouble.	He noticed that I was industrious, that I did not lie idle even when I was in great pain.	He was proud to show Veronica that she might count on his courage, where he had only the forces of nature to contend against, and not the treacherous tricks of Jost.	What reason had Jost for deceiving him and keeping him at a distance?	"With you it was very different, my boy," she said in conclusion.	When she came out upon the open pathway, she saw Dietrich coming across the field in hot haste.	If he could become rich at once, without working any more, why shouldn't he do it?	if you did not have it you would know what it is worth," replied Sabina, quickly.	Judith was pained that Gertrude had not from the beginning talked with her of her troubles, for Judith was one who liked to give and receive sympathy.	It is late for the old gentleman to be out."	The rose was not put into the book and the book into the cup-board, until the time came for the children to say their evening prayers.	She had not heard his knocks, and she stared at him with amazement.	Dietrich shook his old comrade by the hand and ran off.	On the other side Veronica walked, listening in silence.	I came to you with it because of our old friendship.	He pulled his cap down over his eyes and left the inn.	People always think that their own sorrows are the worst.	"I should have gone to him long ago," he said, "but his mother is always about, and she looks at a fellow as a bird does when somebody is trying to rob her nest.	She would talk it all over with Gertrude this very evening.	She had a book close at hand, which she had just finished reading, and from which she expected great things for the young girl.	It was dark now and all was still.	Blasi was not afraid.	His mother could only shake her head in reply.	Veronica will fully repay you for what you have done for her."	"If you had been here two hours ago, you might have seen a sight.	What put that into your head, child?"	Veronica said she believed that Jost would scarcely care to say anything about the letter.	When they reached the crossways where the footpath led up by the tavern of the Rehbock, Dietrich turned into it, and his mother was about to follow him, but Veronica drew her back, saying anxiously, "Don't go that way, mother dear; it is not much farther by the other road."	Blasi understood neither her words nor her anger.	"Well, this was the one drop wanting!"	Outwardly she was tranquil and composed; but within was a storm of conjectures, fears and hopes.	asked Jost with a knowing wink.	She recalled the evening of the day when her husband was borne from the house to his burial.	"Can you let me go so coolly, Veronica?	I am sorry to ask you to do a disagreeable errand, but you see Mother is much disturbed because this mail-bag has not been sent back.	She'll have me."	They're going to be married.	Such a fight at the Rehbock!	"You might say who you mean."	"No, mother, I must not say it.	"What?	It is very pleasant to have every one like him, but too great popularity is not always a good thing.	said Judith sharply.	Veronica sat thinking.	He explained how he came by the letter, but she was too deaf to understand him.	She entered and her new life began.	Who is there for her to call upon if she wants help, hey?"	"Where were you, Dietrich?"	I need you both to make me perfectly happy, and cannot spare either of you;" and she looked from one to the other with caressing glances.	repeated Sabina angrily, "when I tell you this place is yours!	He would buy a neck-tie in the morning; he had money enough for that.	I am going," he said, coming towards her.	said Blasi, significantly, and he winked so mysteriously first with one eye and then with the other, that the saddler said to himself, "I guess he's been at the Rehbock."	She hurried up the hill road, not so much from fear of going through the wood alone, as from desire to spare Gertrude the anxiety of watching for her.	No fellow can understand them.
