"Lofty I stand from each sister land, patient and wearily wise,    With the weight of a world of sadness in my quiet, passionless eyes;    Dreaming alone of a people, dreaming alone of a day,    When men shall not rape my riches, and curse me and go away;    Making a bawd of my bounty, fouling the hand that gave --    Till I rise in my wrath and I sweep on their path      and I stamp them into a grave.	And who would dream as I speak    In a tribal tongue like a rogue unhung, 'mid the ranch-house filth and reek,    I could roll to bed with a Latin phrase and rise with a verse of Greek?	What have I lost!	New Year's Eve    It's cruel cold on the water-front, silent and dark and drear;     Only the black tide weltering, only the hissing snow;    And I, alone, like a storm-tossed wreck, on this night of the glad New Year,     Shuffling along in the icy wind, ghastly and gaunt and slow.	"In the early days we were just a few, and we hunted and fished around,    Nor dreamt by our lonely camp-fires of the wealth that lay under the ground.	I'm afraid to tell you, Honey, I can take no bitter leaving;     But softly in the sleep-time from your love I'll steal away.	Master, I've filled my contract, wrought in Thy many lands;    Not by my sins wilt Thou judge me, but by the work of my hands.	Don't you remember that long, last waltz, with its sobbing, sad refrain?	These are the simple facts of the case, and I guess I ought to know.	And you scarce could see the house-tops for the flags that flew between;     The bells were pealing madly to the sky;    And everyone was shouting for the Soldiers of the Queen,     And the glory of an age was passing by.	Oh, to have fallen!	*    *    *    *    *    The burn brawls darkly down the shaggy glen;     The bee-kissed heather blooms around the door;    He sees himself a barefoot boy again,     Bending o'er page of legendary lore.	We're the men who paid the blood-price.	"Money was just like dirt there, easy to get and to spend.	He laughed death in the face,     And struck, for Empire's sake, a giant blow.	mushed your huskies up the river,     Dared the unknown, led the way, and clutched the prize?	'Twas the crowning cry of a heart's despair,      and it thrilled you through and through --    "I guess I'll make it a spread misere," said Dangerous Dan McGrew.	There was triumph, triumph, triumph down the scarlet gleaming street;     The town was mad; a man was like a boy.	He is one of the Legion Lost;     He was never meant to win;    He's a rolling stone, and it's bred in the bone;     He's a man who won't fit in.	Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no;      then he says with a sort of moan:    "It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold      till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.	Grin    If you're up against a bruiser and you're getting knocked about --                                            Grin.	Oh, the little ol' log cabin, it's a solemn shinin' mark,     When a feller gits ter sinnin' an' a-goin' ter the wall,    An' folks don't understand him an' he's gropin' in the dark,     An' he's sick of bein' cursed at an' he's longin' fer his call!	If you're up against it badly, then it's only one on you,                                            So grin.	They miss my little camp-fires, ever brightly, bravely gleaming     In the womb of desolation, where was never man before;    As comradeless I sought them, lion-hearted, loving, dreaming,     And they hailed me as a comrade, and they loved me evermore.	They rule the world.	Through the round of heat and hurry, through the racket and the rout,     He rattles at a pace that nothing mars;    And when the night-winds whisper and camp-fires flicker out,     He is sleeping like a child beneath the stars.	play up, School, and play the game...   ... Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name..."         _This was the song of the parson's son, as he lay in his bunk alone,         Ere the fire went out and the cold crept in,           and his blue lips ceased to moan,         And the hunger-maddened malamutes had torn him flesh from bone._ The Call of the Wild    Have you gazed on naked grandeur where there's nothing else to gaze on,     Set pieces and drop-curtain scenes galore,    Big mountains heaved to heaven, which the blinding sunsets blazon,     Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar?	Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;    And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.	He looked like a man with a foot in the grave      and scarcely the strength of a louse,    Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar,      and he called for drinks for the house.	It's bully in a high-toned joint to eat and drink your fill,    But it's quite another matter when you                                            Pay the bill.	Hark to the song where spheral voices blend:    "There's no beginning, never will be end."	And oh, the dreary rhythm of their song!	The Law of the Yukon    This is the law of the Yukon, and ever she makes it plain:    "Send not your foolish and feeble; send me your strong and your sane --    Strong for the red rage of battle; sane for I harry them sore;    Send me men girt for the combat, men who are grit to the core;    Swift as the panther in triumph, fierce as the bear in defeat,    Sired of a bulldog parent, steeled in the furnace heat.	It makes us nutty; hang the astral chimes!	He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;    And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.	They have cradled you in custom, they have primed you with their preaching,     They have soaked you in convention through and through;    They have put you in a showcase; you're a credit to their teaching --     But can't you hear the Wild?	They try to rally -- ah, too late, too late!	Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;    Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;    The flames just soared, and the furnace roared --      such a blaze you seldom see;    And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.	The Shooting of Dan McGrew    A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute saloon;    The kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time tune;    Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan McGrew,    And watching his luck was his light-o'-love, the lady that's known as Lou.	Have you chummed up with the mesa?	In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him sway;    Then he clutched the keys with his talon hands      -- my God!	Say:  "He turned from Fortune's offering to follow up a pale lure,     He is one of us no longer -- let him be."	And sometimes it leads to the mountain, to the light of the lone camp-fire,    And you gnaw your belt in the anguish of hunger-goaded desire.	Send me the best of your breeding, lend me your chosen ones;    Them will I take to my bosom, them will I call my sons;    Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat;    But the others -- the misfits, the failures -- I trample under my feet.	Each one a brand of this devil's land,      where I've played and I've lost the game,    A broken wreck with a craze for `hooch', and never a cent to my name.	And sometimes it leads to the Southland, to the swamp where the orchid glows,    And you rave to your grave with the fever,      and they rob the corpse for its clothes.	And he answered that woman, "Yes."	The Little Old Log Cabin    When a man gits on his uppers in a hard-pan sort of town,     An' he ain't got nothin' comin' an' he can't afford ter eat,    An' he's in a fix for lodgin' an' he wanders up an' down,     An' you'd fancy he'd been boozin', he's so locoed 'bout the feet;    When he's feelin' sneakin' sorry an' his belt is hangin' slack,     An' his face is peaked an' gray-like an' his heart gits down an' whines,    Then he's apt ter git a-thinkin' an' a-wishin' he was back     In the little ol' log cabin in the shadder of the pines.	There's men that somehow just grip your eyes,      and hold them hard like a spell;    And such was he, and he looked to me like a man who had lived in hell;    With a face most hair, and the dreary stare of a dog whose day is done,    As he watered the green stuff in his glass, and the drops fell one by one.	Everything hard but headwork (I'd no more brains than a kid),    A brute with brute strength to labor, doing as I was bid;    Living in camps with men-folk, a lonely and loveless life;    Never knew kiss of sweetheart, never caress of wife.	He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;    Though he'd often say in his homely way that he'd "sooner live in hell".	The pallid pimp of the dead-line, the enervate of the pen,    One by one I weeded them out, for all that I sought was -- Men.	And now they're all a-crying, and it's no use me denying;     The spell of them is on me and I'm helpless as a child;    My heart is aching, aching, but I hear them, sleeping, waking;     It's the Lure of Little Voices, it's the mandate of the Wild.	For I know I'd just be longing for the little old log cabin,     With the morning-glory clinging to the door,    Till I loathed the city places, cursed the care on all the faces,     Turned my back on lazar London evermore.	but I'm weak -- since the bitter dawn, and never a bite of food);    I'll just go over and slip inside -- I mustn't give way to despair --     Perhaps I can bum a little booze if the boys are feeling good.	The grave, gaunt pines imprison her sad gaze,     All still the sky and darkling drearily;    She feels the chilly breath of dear, dead days     Come sifting through the alders eerily.	"But the others, the men of my mettle, the men who would 'stablish my fame    Unto its ultimate issue, winning me honor, not shame;    Searching my uttermost valleys, fighting each step as they go,    Shooting the wrath of my rapids, scaling my ramparts of snow;    Ripping the guts of my mountains, looting the beds of my creeks,    Them will I take to my bosom, and speak as a mother speaks.	Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;     Let us journey to a lonely land I know.	*    *    *    *    *    In many a Highland home, framed with rude art,     You'll find his portrait, rough-hewn, stern and square;    It's graven in the Fuyam fellah's heart;     The Ghurka reads it at his evening prayer;     The raw lands know it, where the fierce suns glare;    The Dervish fears it.	Oh, how the roses riot in their bloom!	Yet 'tain't being dead -- it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;    So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains."	Quatrains    One said:  Thy life is thine to make or mar,    To flicker feebly, or to soar, a star;     It lies with thee -- the choice is thine, is thine,    To hit the ties or drive thy auto-car.	And deep in his hell sang the Devil, and this was the strain of his song:    "The ancient, outworn, Puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong."	Have you whistled bits of rag-time at the end of all creation,     And learned to know the desert's little ways?	"She is mine, she is mine for evermore!"	the violins seemed to say,     And the bells were ringing the New Year in -- O God!	Up with the curtain!	Alone we sat on the balcony, and the fan-palms arched above;    The witching strain of a waltz by Strauss came up to our cool retreat,     And I prisoned her little hand in mine, and I whispered my plea of love.	They range the field and they rove the flood,     And they climb the mountain's crest;    Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood,     And they don't know how to rest.	But now her hands like moonlight brush the keys     With velvet grace -- melodious delight;    And now a sad refrain from over seas     Goes sobbing on the bosom of the night;    And now she sings.	Pitched on his head, and pumped full of lead, was Dangerous Dan McGrew,    While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast      of the lady that's known as Lou.	But I'm not dead yet; though with half a lung there isn't time to spare,    And I hope that the year will see me out, and, thank God, no one will care --    Save maybe the little slim Siwash girl with the rose of shame in her hair.	And I know at the dawn she'll come reeling home      with the bottles, one, two, three --    One for herself, to drown her shame, and two big bottles for me,    To make me forget the thing I am and the man I used to be.	It's all decreed -- the mighty earthquake crash,    The countless constellations' wheel and flash;     The rise and fall of empires, war's red tide;    The composition of your dinner hash.	So send me far from Lombard Street, and write me down a failure;     Put a little in my purse and leave me free.	Well, here's to you!"	If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;    It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.	I'll just sneak into a corner and they'll let me alone a bit;     The room is reeling round and round...       O God!	The Song of the Wage-Slave    When the long, long day is over, and the Big Boss gives me my pay,    I hope that it won't be hell-fire, as some of the parsons say.	And each forgets, as he strips and runs     With a brilliant, fitful pace,    It's the steady, quiet, plodding ones     Who win in the lifelong race.	Cause and effect are grim, relentless powers.	Eating his heart out with a wild desire,     One day, behind his counter trim and neat,    He hears a sound that sets his brain afire --     The Highlanders are marching down the street.	Have you camped upon the foothills, have you galloped o'er the ranges,     Have you roamed the arid sun-lands through and through?
