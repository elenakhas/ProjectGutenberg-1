But the mules did not know the right way.	Emma asked.	There was a vast amount of work and never enough time.	"I'll be doggone!"	There were counters and shelves, but they were not heavily loaded.	Winterson leveled his rifle through another window, shot, and the grass stopped rippling.	It will be a nice log house, with a big kitchen where I can make the things you like, and every day when you come in from the fields you'll bring me wild flowers.	She shivered and said fretfully, between stiff lips, "I'm cold."	He looked keenly at the approaching riders.	Percy Pearl remained unruffled.	She spoke a little tiredly, and Joe said nothing.	And Emma was thinking how good it felt to be camped in this one place, and to know that they would be in the same place tomorrow evening again.	You know, I used to dream of going back to Boston and spend my time smoking a pipe and wearing slippers when I got a pension.	He looked closely at her.	That's an interesting document, too, in its own little way.	she called to him, but Ellis was eating silently, scarcely aware of the food at all.	Put 'em together in a little corral, and there won't be a prettier six-mule team in Missouri."	She couldn't quite get it into words, but it did seem like a real melting and fusing of two destinies into one destiny.	She had brought upon her husband five painful and unproductive years.	Barbara, no more than a feather's weight, encircled Ellis's waist and they were off.	The children began to giggle and chatter as they started a game.	She would not put it beyond city people to snatch a woman's purse if they could.	Martha Winterson pursed her lips, dampened one side of her cloth with whisky, and said, "Now this may sting a little."	"Fifty dollars a head."	Joe remembered vaguely that he had heard of white bears, or western grizzlies, and the bear was of a pale color.	Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work.	If he didn't, if there was any more irresponsible shooting, he'd feel the flat of his father's hand again.	Her eyes were swimming.	"They've taken the wagon!"	Wuthless pup!	Joe relaxed on the stream bank, giving himself completely to thoughts of this new venture and at peace with himself and the world.	Suppose we hadn't come through?	She reached into her trunk, brought out a brown bottle, and glanced aside at Joe.	He returned riding a fancy thoroughbred with a new saddle and he had also got hold of two new Colt revolvers and an apparently endless supply of ammunition.	She whispered through the curtain, "Tad?"	Huh?"	Then he was beside her under the robes, giving to her chilled body the warmth of his own.	Across the creek and up on the opposite slope, sixteen Indians stood in the meadow.	Suppose there was another river that could not be forded, one Gaystell hadn't mentioned?	"They'll be fine."	"Wish I'd kep' count of the piddlin' little critters that dog of your'n has took after, Joe.	Even the children were still, and Emma turned to Joe, vaguely puzzled.	Tad breathed.	"We're going to the dance there."	She'll have it, now."	"Tad," she called, "you and Barbara pick up some of that driftwood along the river and bring it in."	He had escaped injury because he knew mules.	Joe had plowed his vegetable garden near the creek, and it had been a back-breaking job.	But he felt that he should not say that Emma had asked him to find out.	They'd seen Barbara during her short stay at Camp Axton, and they wouldn't miss a chance to kiss this bride.	"I like this better.	I don't want to marry any of them."	He shrugged.	Pete had several herds which he kept in different pastures.	Since they couldn't take everything with them--or nearly everything--they would have a lot to sell or trade.	"Want to go there?"	"The west will be tamed, but I'm right glad I ain't goin' to live to see it all tamed.	Silence lay all around.	Overnight the weather had turned very cold, so that a thick glazing of frost lay on the windows.	Emma followed her daughter's anguished gaze, and she suppressed a gasp.	Her face wholly blissful, little Emma cradled the doll in her arms and began crooning to it.	However, if a man knew mules, they always gave some warning.	"Oh yes!"	Thus, out of the storm, was born their love.	"Make darn' sure we stay on the Trail."	Albert Johnson asked me to go to Baltimore with him, after we're married of course!	"It'll stay by a man."	"I dunno.	"I ain't tellin' you what to do, but if you want real good country whar you can take your pick, thar's some a mite beyond Fort Boise.	Without looking back and without entering the store, he turned and strode through the darkness toward his house.	Her eyes filled with tears and she tried to speak.	They plunged forward, dragging the plow on top of the ground.	There were more important affairs.	At the same time no one regretted any part of last night.	Joe felt his anger rise, but he held it in check.	He was about to eat it when he straightened and looked down the Trail.	He stared almost haughtily at his father and Joe's eyes narrowed.	"We can always pick up something else if we don't find any."	"Oh, thank you.	What are you going to do if Joe sells more wood or the hay?"	Just for an hour?"	And I need supplies!"	Except for the stubborn Tad, who obviously intended to make good his boast that he would walk all the way to Oregon, Joe's family was in the wagon.
