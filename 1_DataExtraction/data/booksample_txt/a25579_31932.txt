But it can use anything if it has to--" Jenkins stared at the little biochemist, an image in his mind of the pink creature in the hold, growing larger by the minute as it ate its way through the hydroponics, through the dry stores, through-- "Is there anything it _can't_ use?"	It just sank down wetly and began to eat.	The piece of _hlorg_ was truly and sincerely dead.	"Idiot!"	Jenkins looked up sharply.	The Black Doctor was there; so were Bowman and Hrunta.	"They don't.	I'm taking it to Neelsen for paraffin sections.	And that includes the lining of the tanks, which he seems to like as much as the contents.	The blob kept coming and coming until it rested soggily on the edge of the hole.	A severed piece will rejoin if it can.	Survey was the soul and lifeblood of the medical services supplied by Hospital Earth to the inhabited planets of the Galaxy.	We're supposed to worry about the health of the Galaxy."	Wally Stone shuddered.	"Ugh," said Sam Jenkins, feeling suddenly sick.	Jenkins blinked.	They had dropped chunks of it in acid vats and covered other chunks with desiccants and alkalis.	"If there is, I haven't found it," Hrunta said sadly.	Jenkins asked.	Now, with their own home base invaded by a hungry pink jelly-blob, the Survey Crew of the _Mercy_ dug in with all fours to find a way to exorcise it.	"Ugly bastard.	"It inactivates the enzyme system, and renders the base protoplasm vulnerable to anything that normally attacks it.	"Seventh son of a seventh son--" Five minutes later he was staring at the vats in Hrunta's laboratory.	"I'm sorry, sir."	And such creatures to dream up--eating, growing, devouring plant, animal and mineral without discrimination-- And the Maukivi had stoutly maintained that this _hlorg_ of theirs was indestructible--        *       *       *       *       * Green Doctor Wally Stone, true to his surgical calling, was a man of action.	There's nothing holding him in but energy."	"We've got it!"	"You mean there _is_ such a thing?"	"What's this supposed to mean?"	The Black Doctors were the pragmatists, the gadflies of Hospital Earth.	"You want it technical?"	His bunk had been slept in, but he wasn't in it.	In fact, it was for that reason, and only that reason, that the Black Service had come to be the leaders and the whips, the executors and directors of all the manifold operations of Hospital Earth.	He absorbs.	"Wally?"	"You're not going to like it, either."	One of the boys spent half of yesterday out there gathering them up.	Morua II elevated from Class VI to Class I, with certain special riders.	It focussed on the rear storage hold of the _Mercy_ where the little _Lancet_ was resting on its landing rack.	I've sent plague-warnings out for Galactic relay.	This baby has an enzyme system that's straight from hell.	He wasn't a very good cook, but what could anyone do with the sludge from the harvest shelf of a hydroponic tank?	Enzyme systems operate under specific optimum conditions, right?	"It'll be months before we get back to Hospital Earth.	But it's just formed a crust of coagulated protein around itself, and sits there--" Bowman peered over his shoulder, his mustache twitching.	"Down in the hold.	But perhaps you'll permit one simple question from a dull old man, just to humor him."	"Friend of yours?"	What is it?"	There's no other way.	"Not in person."	The _hlorg_ had stopped eating.	Stone shook his head slowly.	They sent Bowman back to quarters for a hot bath and a shot of Happy-O and looked up Hrunta, the biochemist.	"But it says nothing!"	"He was down there with the thing all day," Bowman said sadly.	He found the one he was looking for.	Toss it overboard!"	The supply was discouragingly small, but there was some in stock.	"But he was in _bed_."	I realize that we know nothing of medicine, nor of disease, nor of the manner in which disease is spread.	Frantically he untied himself and slid into his clothes.	A physical approach may tell us how in this case.	"You can also count me out."	On another table were the remains of Hrunta's (unsuccessful) attempt to prepare an anti-_hlorg_ serum.	He gave them a snarl and shoved a sheaf of papers into their hands.	"That's exactly what it means."	He'd go after the functional anatomy first, he thought, as he approached the task with gusto.	the Black Doctor burst out when they told him the news.	When the creature has exhausted our food stores, it will look elsewhere for food.	"Where did you find it?"	"A frontal attack?"	All the same, he tied a length of stout cord around his ankle just to make sure he didn't do any sleepwalking.	"Hrunta must have spotted it and come down here alone," Jenkins panted between slices.	"And in case you are thinking of enlisting help from outside, forget it.	It hissed and sputtered and sent up quantities of acrid steam.	Bowman looked at Stone, and Stone looked at Bowman.	"Your _hlorg_ is an ideal anamorph.	Jenkins looked at the floor.	Then it flowed back to rejoin the body with a wet gurgle.	It was not surprising that their casual offerings of medical services wherever their ships touched had led to a growing demand for those services, until the first Medical Service Contract with Deneb III had formalized the planetary specialty.	He must have waste materials of some sort."	Protoplasm, just protoplasm."
