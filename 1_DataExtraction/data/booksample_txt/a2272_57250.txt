In its deep cup--grassy, cool--       Sleeps the little roadside pool;       Sleeps the butterfly on the weed,       Sleeps the drifted thistle-seed.	Don’t keep the bobolinks singing without you.	But wandering wizards watched his outward path,       And marked his fenceless dwelling for their wrath.	Soon to its ebb the slow tide crept.	We mount, we mount           Till the moon seems nigh.	I see thine eyes, I see their grave desire,       Unsatisfied and lonely as the sea’s;--       Yet how unlike the wintry sea’s despair!	Where were the children gone?	Empire in the coasts of bloom       Humming cohorts now resume,--         And desire is forth to follow       Many a vagabond perfume.	And it’s oh, to be a cricket         In the clover!	With noiseless steps I threaded the wood,       Glad of the sun-pierced solitude.	“My God!	Solemnly breaks the long wave at thy feet;       And sullenly in patches clings the snow       Upon the low, red rocks worn round with years.	The sterile hillocks are thy home,         Beside the windy path;       The sky, a pale and lonely dome,         Is all thy vision hath.	My boy!” the Captain said.	The sun has kissed the apples,             Kissed the apples;       And the yellow miles of grain             Forget the rain.	*       *       *       *       *       All day she sang by the cottage door         (Oh, home, home in the evening).	He reached the other side, he set down the dainty maid;         But he trembled so he couldn’t speak a word.	Shuttle-cock of indecision,       Sport of chance’s blind derision,         Yet he may not fail nor tire       Till his eyes shall win the Vision.	Space, in the dim predestined hour,       Shall crumble like a ruined tower.	The burly and the proud, the braggarts of the crowd,       Every one of them he topples down in thunder.	I heave aloft the smoking hill;       To silent peace its throes I still.	And now a wind that chafed the flood       Blew down from Noel’s haunted wood;       And now in the dread tides that run       Past the grim front of Blomidon,       Over the rolling troughs, between       The purple gulfs, the slopes of green,       With sickening glide and sullen rest       The old boat climbed from crest to crest.	The boy rode on.	And the water-bubbles chuckled as they heard.	With the warm heart wise and wild.	The Cricket       Oh, to be a cricket,         That’s the thing!	With patient art he shaped them true,         With calm, untiring care;       And none of those bright watchers knew         Which one to call most fair.	The Little Field of Peace       By the long wash of his ancestral sea         He sleeps how quietly!	Apple Song       O the sun has kissed the apples,             Kissed the apples;       And the apples, hanging mellow,             Red and yellow,       All down the orchard seen       Make a glory in the green.	We’ll give it passage in ‘The Foam’”--       Soft is the heart that’s bound for home!	Thrilled with heat, it split the husk,         Shot a green blade up to light,       And unfurled its orange petals         In the old Enchanter’s sight.	Then came great whales, obedient to his hand,       And bare him to the demon-haunted land,       Where, in malign morass and ghostly wood       And grim cliff-cavern, lurked the evil brood.	When, rich with rose, a wandering air         Breathes up the leafy place,       It seems to me thy perfumed hair         Blown across my face.	The tide goes out; the dwindling channels ache       With the old hunger, with the old heartbreak.	And it’s oh, to be a cricket       In the warm thistle-thicket,         Where the sun-winds pass,         Winds a-wing,       And the bumble-bees hang humming,         Hum and swing,       And the honey-drops are coming!	Such a guest from Paradise       Gladdens every mother’s eyes.	Don’t keep the buttercups so long waiting.	The father raised his anxious head;       He saw the light, like a dawn of blood,         That streamed across his bed.	Moth and blossom, blade and bee,       Worlds must go as well as we,           In the long procession joining       Mount, and star, and sea.	Wake up, Golden Head!	Delight is not for long,--       Give us laughter, give us song!	But ever at its heart of fire       I lurk, an unassuaged desire.	And lo!	“Stop for a kitten?” growled the mate:--       “Look to the sun; we’re getting late!	Our rout possesses           The middle sky.	The boy came safe to the river ford,         And out of the deadly wood.	It climbs to meet the westering sun       Upon the heights of Blomidon,--       Bulwark of peace, whose bastioned form       Out-bars the serried hosts of storm.	Then the top is a burden, the bugle a bane             (Oh, weary, my Dearie, so weary!)	Hark, the moving shapes confer,       Globe of dew and gossamer,           Fading and ephemeral spirits       In the dusk astir.	Up and down the shining rays       Dancing midges weave their maze.	Ah!	The hard hills ache beneath their spectral hue.	Said he--       “A kitten!	Farer by uncharted ways,       Dumb as Death to plaint or praise,         Unreturning he shall journey,       Fellow to the nights and days:--       Till upon the outer bar       Stilled the moaning currents are,--         Till the flame achieves the zenith,--       Till the moth attains the star,--       Till, through laughter and through tears,       Fair the final peace appears,         And about the watered pastures       Sink to sleep the nomad years!	The ship came up into the wind;       The slackening canvas flapped and dinned;       And the ship’s boat with scant delay       Was swung and lowered and away,--       The Captain at the helm, and four       Stout men of Avon at the oar.	It lit the old clock on the wall,         It lit the room with splendor wild,       It lit the fair and tumbled hair         Of the still sleeping child;       And zigzag fence, and rude log barn,         And chip-strewn yard, and cabin gray,       Glowed crimson in the shuddering glare         Of that untimely day.	The tide goes out, goes out; the stranded ships       Desire the sea,--and I desire thy lips.	The king’s haughty crown drops in jeers from his pate       As the hold closes on him, and he reels.	And not far off, on tiptoe seen,       The brown dike and the sky between,       A shifting field that heaves and slides,--       The blue breast of the Minas tides.	June’s come into the world this morning.	Butterflies       Once in a garden, when the thrush’s song,         Pealing at morn, made holy all the air,       Till earth was healed of many an ancient wrong,         And life appeared another name for prayer,       Rose suddenly a swarm of butterflies,         On wings of white and gold and azure fire;       And one said, “These are flowers that seek the skies,         Loosed by the spell of their supreme desire.”             July       I am for the open meadows,         Open meadows full of sun,       Where the hot bee hugs the clover,         The hot breezes drop and run.	I stripped my days of dear delights         To cast them in the flame,       Till life seemed naked as a rock,         And pleasure but a name.	Good-day!” she said.	I hold in my hand his dearest hand,       The happiest woman in all the land         (Oh, home, home in the evening).	High among the moveless boughs,       Drunk with day, the night-hawks drowse.	Sweet!	The sun has kissed the apples,             Kissed the apples;       O’er the marsh the cattle spread,             White and red.	Not as a stranger or alone he went         Unto his long content;       But kissed to sleep and comforted lies he         By his ancestral sea.	He shuts up the earth, and he opens the skies.	Like a great and blazing gem,       Basks the beetle on the stem.	And a spell came out of space       From the light of its starry place,           And I saw in the deep of my heart       The image of God’s face.	The father’s mouth was white and stern,         But his eyes grew tender with long farewell.	The shadows of his oak-tree flit and play         Above his dreams all day.	The boy was snatched to the saddle-bow.	An August Wood Road       When the partridge coveys fly       In the birch-tops cool and high;       When the dry cicadas twang       Where the purpling fir-cones hang;       When the bunch-berries emboss--       Scarlet beads--the roadside moss:       Brown with shadows, bright with sun,       All day long till day is done       Sleeps in murmuring solitude       The worn old road that threads the wood.	Mary, when the helpless Child         Nursed and slumbered at thy breast,       In the rosy form and mild         Didst thou see the Heavenly Guest?	The brook bared its pebbles to persuade her dainty feet,         But the dainty, dainty maid was not content.	A lesson from the Power I crave         That moves in me and thee,       That makes thee modest, calm, and brave,--         Me restless as the sea.	He grew and gloomed before them like a cloud,       And his eye drew them till they cried aloud,       And withering like spent flame before his frown       They ran forth in a madness and fell down.	Hark the flapping, as of banners,       Where the heron triumphs by!	The Captain raised his glass.	The mount, the star, the germ, the deep,       They all shall wake, they all shall sleep.	Thy unobtrusive purple face         Amid the meagre grass       Greets me with long-remembered grace,         And cheers me as I pass.
