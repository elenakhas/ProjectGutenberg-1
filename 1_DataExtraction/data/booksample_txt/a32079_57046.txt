It would be a good plan to set off for school early, she decided, and go around by Somerset Lane for a cheering moment of talk with Miss Miranda.	I try to study by myself at night but—I don’t get very far.	“Yes, I rather think he did.	Then across the edge of the hollow, white against the dark underbrush, he saw the dogs coming, a line of swift, leaping forms, huge, shaggy and beautiful, their great voices all giving tongue together.	CHAPTER IV                           THE DOOR IN THE WALL Spring had advanced to that season of damp, hot, sunny days and rainy nights when all things are growing at such speed that shrubs and trees are top-heavy with their new green shoots and are easily shaken by the wind, while people feel restless and uneasy and would like to be doing something different from the tasks before them.	“I don’t feel very comfortable here myself,” he agreed, “and it is getting rather dark.	“Joe tells me that you said the bird belongs to Miss Miranda Reynolds,” she said, seating herself ponderously at the other end of the bench while Elizabeth partook of the welcome refreshment, and scattered crumbs for Dick.	The second wolf, with slobbering bloody jaws, turned to listen, the flock of sheep snorted and stamped in the snow.	Miss Miranda doesn’t pretend that this big garden and these ducks and hens are here for her own pleasure, she owns that she must have the money that she makes by them, but it’s my belief that not even you and I know how much she needs it.” His damp pipe, rebellious at last, refused to be rekindled, which delayed him for a long minute.	Stars glinted now and again in the pool also, long beams of light in the ruffled water, although, as she came near, there chanced to be quiet for a moment so that she saw reflected the irregular circle of light that Miss Miranda had told her was the Northern Crown.	David, she knew, when there was nothing more he could do in preparation, had begun to look forward to the occasion since the very fact that the chances were against him lent some excitement to the affair.	She seemed quite brave and cheerful again.	“At least he has sense enough to seem a little sorry for what he has done.” “I see now why Miss Miranda has looked so worried,” Betsey added.	Just facing them, was a stretch of wall still partly unbroken, showing a few windows and a door, charred and blackened by the cruel fire, but still firm on its hinges.	Helplessly the boy spun the cylinder and snapped the hammer again and again, but to no purpose.	Betsey slowly lifted one heavy foot out of the mud and then the other, and walked very thoughtfully up the path.	“That opening between the two biggest trees gives space to reflect the sunset and show the evening star.	“It’s not true,” she burst out.	“If it was in the Old Country,” he muttered, “the very Little People themselves would rise up to help a man in such a plight.	“I don’t understand what happened.	“I know, I know,” the boy returned quickly, “but wasn’t Mr. Reynolds in his shop all the rest of the evening?	But I didn’t know that you were anywhere near.” “That was but an April shower,” he rejoined, “such as a stiff old man could get the better of, but I’ve known this long time that I wasn’t able any more to fight one of these unseasonable thunderstorms.	Ah, what did I tell you?” For a figure had come into the moonlit open and Donald Reynolds had laid a hand on the gate.	Won’t you ever learn better, Michael?” David said severely, although the pathetic broken figure on the stones was one to call forth only pity.	“Miranda must have that,” was his instant decision; “she will find that I can manage to bring home the gold snuffbox and something more besides.” His determined effort to buy the tree, however, had a strange effect.	You wouldn’t understand, not either of you, though you have keen, kind eyes yourselves.” Betsey looked back at him anxiously as they went toward the house to fulfill his request.	Oh, if we should find what is lost, at last!” David was already on his feet, peering over the stone wall toward the pool.	Finally a farmer’s cottage at the edge of a river came in sight and, to her relief here, the running fight seemed to have come to an end.	She felt, in fact, that it was wise to say as little as possible and to bend all her efforts to resisting the storm of arguments and protests that would be poured out upon her.	His farewells were less stately than his greetings had been, and he turned back for a last word before he went over the side.	“That is the only way to stop this thing and I can’t leave the broken crank-shaft.” Even in her haste Betsey noticed how quiet and cool he was, and with what quick skill he was adjusting valves and closing cylinder cocks, all the time keeping out of the way of the plunging and slashing of the broken rod.	But I was wrong—all wrong!	“The examiners were a clever set of fellows, they managed to guess at all the things I knew and to ask me about very little else.	“Miss Betsey,” he said slowly, “you don’t believe in bad spirits, do you, the kind that bring ill luck to people that deserve only the best and fairest fortune on earth?” She was quite startled that his thoughts and hers should have been following so closely the same channel, but she would not admit the fact.	Jonathan had his dreams also, but he did not speak of them, only toiled away at building the heavy, sturdy vessels that carried America’s trade overseas early in the last century.	“With the cold and the snow, I’m thinking there will be worse things abroad this night than just the coyotes.” He lay very still while Ted sat beside him, beginning to feel sleepy and blinking at the firelight.	And she has always dreaded his coming.	The old chimney, split by the lightning and weakened by fire and frost, was ready to tumble at the slightest shock and had received its final impetus from the collapse of the neighboring wall.	But you will not be entering this gate.	At the end of the ninth day, while the _West Wind_ was wallowing in a cross sea, it was discovered that the water casks had broken loose from their lashings, that two of them were crushed, others injured, and that the greater portion of their precious water had leaked away.	I will always like to think of how Jonathan and Humphrey succeeded in the face of everything.	There was a little pine tree carved out of something that looked like green glass.	“He says charms for luck when he puts in the cabbage plants, and he thinks that if the first peas are not sown on Saint Patrick’s Day, they will none of them come up at all.	“His name was Don, Mr. Donald Reynolds he is now, and I find it hard to remember when I see him, that they were ever little things here together and he was her Cousin Don.	“He can say very hard and cruel things,” she added; “you have not told me all of them, but I can guess.” She went to the workshop to speak to her father, but David met her at the door.	It was clear enough to Elizabeth, long afterwards, just what heavy trouble was brooding over the little household of the cottage, and just what part she was destined to play in dispelling it.	He’s not much of a saddle horse.	Betsey, leaning over to watch in an agony of apprehension, felt her tired spirit completely give way.	They would have rusted to bits in a little longer; we have not found them at all too soon.” Michael’s wits seemed to be wandering a little when they returned to him, nor did he appear to understand very clearly the account that, both speaking excitedly, they poured into his ears.	There will be others like her, and her children’s children will dare to spread such sail that they will cross the Atlantic in half your time.” As Humphrey came up the ladder to where Miranda was waiting on the wharf, his first words were— “I left the snuffbox behind,” while she, laughing shakily, answered— “I knew you would.” The whole crew, down to the cabin boy, were hailed as heroes when they left the ship, but there was one who managed somehow to go ashore as mysteriously as he had come aboard.	“I am going where you go,” she replied and evidently he realized it was no time for argument.	Mr. Reynolds sat opposite in the one arm chair the place afforded, looking white and frail and old in contrast to his visitor, very quiet, and listening with earnest attention.	It’s time something was done.” “If her brother could only come home,” Betsey suggested.	“Wait until I can drive him around by the gate and he’ll be proud to carry you.	The strokes sounded very thin and far away as the night wind carried them.	I have never seen those North African cities, Tangier and Tunis and the rest, and I have no doubt that to-day they are very little like what Humphrey Reynolds saw.	Feel it she did, however, and with the knowledge, made firm her decision.	“Why, it cannot be done!” he cried.	David was about to go through the gate and follow him down the lane, when Michael stopped him.	“If there is anything I can do for you, my dear, be sure to send for me.	Beyond must have been the library and a conservatory behind, at least there are mountains of broken glass beside that wall.” From here, then, had been rescued the toy-cupboard and such pieces of heavy mahogany furniture as were still in use in the cottage and which stood out in such strong contrast to the very plain chairs and tables of painted pine that filled the rest of the Reynolds’ abode.	Miss Miranda, leaning comfortably against a tree, had taken out her knitting.	“By the way,” questioned the old man, “ought I to remember your name?	“My poor sheep, I must save them,” he cried.	“If it had refused to run I did not want any one to know of it.	Donald, in evident concern, was coming closer, but David barred the way and warned him off.	“Twenty-three days is the best she will do,” he vowed over and over again.	The gate in the wall was swinging open just as she had guessed, the path beyond stretched away like a black tunnel through the trees.	“I have been thinking about such a design since I was ten years old,” he said, “and the chance to build it has come at last.	In gathering up the scattered papers she had found one among the rest that looked strangely and disagreeably familiar.	Blinded and breathless, they scrambled out of the hollow to safety.	“You can prove that, I suppose?	As she crossed the lawn by the house she saw that the workshop door was open to the warm night air and that Mr. Reynolds was as busy as ever inside.	“It was rather late for just ordinary visitors.	What was it doing to the garden laid out on the long slope, all that flood of water rushing from the top of the hill to the valley below?	One night it was raining and the next the moon was shining and the next it was dim starlight, but the light was there.	“Look at that high, sharp bow,” one would say; “such a craft will never be seaworthy in the world.	The other parts were two steel tubes, about as long as my hand.	It is just at the beginning that I always come to grief.” “Perhaps you could help me and I could help you,” David suggested excitedly.	“You’ve done that none so bad,” it said slowly.	I do believe he was waiting in the lane for Miss Miranda to go out, so that he could find her father alone.	“I kept touching the things and they kept rolling away, I thought I would never get them in my hands.	She sat down to rest, with her feet dangling over the bank above the water and began to think over what she had been hearing.
