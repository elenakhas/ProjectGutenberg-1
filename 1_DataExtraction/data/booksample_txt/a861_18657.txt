Her knight behind her, like a champion bold, His hat upon his elbow, like a shield-- FALK.	That is--you understand--I would have said--!	[To MRS. STRAWMAN.	FALK.	We've majors also by the score, Arsenals heaped with muniments of war, With spurs and howitzers and drums and shot, But what does that permit us to infer?	Evening.	How marvellous a love my steps has led To this sweet trysting place!	FALK.	[SVANHILD and the maids have meantime laid the       tea-table beside the verandah steps.	Indeed?	Patience; she must answer.	Now friends, what would you say To drinking tea?	Your colour's very high.	MRS. HALM [rising].	All the year round the curb and bit we bear, But Whitsuntide and Christmas make things square.	You possibly believe I keep the glue Of lies for Happiness's in a broken jar?	Only, I find the Book will not suffice As Jacob's ladder unto Paradise.	SVANHILD [after watching him a moment, approaches         him and asks gently: Falk, are you angry?	Love-making still a frail foundation is.	I want a whiff of reason and the weed; I haven't smoked for three whole days on end.	Be free?	In my view, A free accord of lovers, heart with heart, Who hold together, having leave to part, Gives the best warrant that their love is true.	FALK.	You go with me?	FALK.	FALK.	Just so.	That's what fills the shop.	FALK.	FALK.	Yes, that's the way!	But now, young man, pray make an end of this.	GULDSTAD.	Pray, excuse me, friend.	GULDSTAD.	Now, dear, put by Your shyness; for to-morrow a spring-tide Of callers will flow in from every side!	[Whimsically.	Back to back!	FALK [uncertain].	Our paths divided.	SVANHILD comes out, she is pale       and agitated.	There comes the tea.	And fearless!	They gaze at each other in silence       a moment, and fling themselves impetuously into       each other's arms.	You too, my Lind?	You can imagine how the suitors swarm'd; Gentlemen of the highest reputation.-- MRS. HALM.	And were I only unengaged like you, Trust me, I'd break a road athwart the snow Of prose, and carry the Ideal through!	"A true heart's story" Lind will not deny me, Whose troth's too tender for the ocean blast, Who for his mistress makes surrender of His fellow-men--pure quintessence of Love!	FALK.	What do you mean?	Hush; I've a deep foreboding that the man Will rob me of my treasure, if he can.	MRS. HALM.	MRS. HALM.	I praise Him, who our love has lifted thus To noble rank by sorrow,--licensed us To a triumphal progress, bade us sweep Thro' fen and forest to our castle-keep, A noble pair, astride on Pegasus!	Who lit the flame.	It is not you!	And nowhere peeps one spray of verdure out!	Read its columns with good heed, You'll see me offered up to Vengeance.	Aha, so that was why you flung The Holy Law and Prophets on the shelf!	You mean the mythical princess, no doubt-- FALK.	STRAWMAN [aside to STIVER].	It is       now dark; the house is lighted up.	Yes, better than to linger in the swamp Till autumn choke it with her grey mists damp!	And the paper's name will be--?	LIND.	LIND [coming hastily but cautiously out].	We stand unshaken, for we stand together!	That was he surely?	Your love, you mean to say, in simple prose, Has made a reindeer of you.	LIND.	Only the snuggery of wedded bliss Provides a rock where Love may builded be In unassailable security.	The tide Of joy's so vehement, it will perforce Break out-- FALK.	Then in the festive ball-room bedded out-- FALK.	And for like cause-- The fascination of the town--it was; But when a little money had come in, And the first pairs of infants, twin by twin, She quite got over it.	Go on!	FALK.	Yes, clear your mind of all this balderdash!	There's my place!	Gather the decision From yon red eyes.	FALK [starting from a reverie].	I--hold her, sir?	'Tis a fine evening.	GULDSTAD.
