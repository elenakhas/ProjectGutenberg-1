Yet some for very ruth and sheer dismay,     Hearing the northwind pipe the winter's name,     Have fired the hills with beaconing clouds of flame;       And some with softer woe that day by day,       So sweet and brief, should go the westward way,     Have yearned upon the sunset with such shame,       That all their cheeks have turned to tremulous rose;         Others for wrath have turned a rusty red,         And some that knew not either grief or dread,       Ere the old year should find its iron close,     Have gathered down the sun's last smiles acold,     Deep, deep, into their luminous hearts of gold.	The trees rustle; the wind blows         Merrily out of the town;     The shadows creep, the sun goes         Steadily over and down.	And yet I think he loved me too; my mood     Was not unpleasant to him, though I know     At times I teased him with my flickering talk.	1.E.6.	Both his heels in wrath are digging       Trenches in the grassy soil,     And his fingers clutch and loosen,       Dreaming of the Persian spoil.	The world is bright with beauty, and its days       Are filled with music; could we only know       True ends from false, and lofty things from low;     Could we but tear away the walls that graze     Our very elbows in life's frosty ways;       Behold the width beyond us with its flow,       Its knowledge and its murmur and its glow,     Where doubt itself is but a golden haze.	Gold is but the juggling rod     Of a false usurping god,     Graven long ago in hell     With a sombre stony spell,     Working in the world forever.

Yet some wild thing is in mine ear;       I hold my breath and hark;     Out of the depth I seem to hear       A crying in the dark:     No sound of man or wife or child,       No sound of beast that groans,     Or of the wind that whistles wild,       Or of the tree that moans:     I know not what it is I hear;       I bend my head and hark:     I cannot drive it from mine ear,       That crying in the dark.	my master waits for me     Mutely, but thou canst not see         With thy mortal blinded eye.	XXXIX.	_Envoi._     So time shall be swift till thou mate with me,       For love is mightiest next to fate,     And none shall be happier, Love, than we,       In the year yet, Lady, to dream and wait.	Such heavenly things the master wrought,       That in his happy dreams he thought     The organ's self did love the gold-haired maid:       But she, the maiden, never guessed       What prayers for her in hours of rest         The sombre organ prayed.	Let them dream; 'tis better so;     Ever dream, but never know.	At last, one summer morning fair,       The maiden came with braided hair     And took his hands, and held them eagerly.	Darkling and strange art thou thus vexed and chidden;       More dark and strange thy veiled agony,     City of storm, in whose grey heart are hidden       What stormier woes, what lives that groan and beat,       Stern and thin-cheeked, against time's heavier sleet,         Rude fates, hard hearts, and prisoning poverty.	How strong and wonderful is night!	Half-hid among the gay Miletian cushions,     The lovely laughing face, the gracious form,     The fragrant lightly-knotted hair, and eyes     Full of the dancing fire of wanton Corinth.	IV.	Full many a wrong note falls, but let it fall!	He that they were bearing by,     With their banners white and high,     He was pure, and foul was I,         And his whiteness mocked my sin.	The King's son walks in the garden fair--       _Oh, the maiden's heart is merry!_     He little knows for his toil and care,     That the bride is gone and the bower is bare.	So I followed, yet not I     Held alone that company:     Every silent passer-by         Paled and turned and joined with me;     So we followed still and fleet,     While the city street by street,     Fell behind our rustling feet         Like a deadened memory.	But ah, how sweet     The memory of that long untroubled day,     To me so joyous, and so free from care,     Spent as I love on foot, our first together,     When fate and the reluctant sea at last     Had given us safely to dry land; the tramp     From grey Mycenae by the pass to Corinth,     The smooth white road, the soft caressing air,     Full of the scent of blossoms, the clear sky,     Strewn lightly with the little tardy clouds,     Old Helios' scattered flock, the low-branched oaks     And fountained resting-places, the cool nooks,     Where eyes less darkened with life's use than mine     Perchance had caught the Naiads in their dreams,     Or won white glimpses of their flying heels.	We sing, and sing, through the grass and the stones and the reeds,         And we never grow tired, though we journey ever and aye,       Dreaming, and dreaming, wherever the long way leads,         Of the far cool rocks and the rush of the wind and the spray.	Yet I think that in some dim shadowy land,       Where no suns rise or set,     Where the ghost of a whilom loom doth stand       Round the dusk of its silken net,     Forever flyeth his shadowy hand,       And the weaver is weaving yet.	LAMENT OF THE WINDS.	How her bosom, breathing low,       Stirs the wavy coverlet     With a motion soft and slow:       Oh, my Lady, wake not yet;     There without a thought of guile       Let my spirit dream a while.	Ere yet I turned     With long stride homeward, being heated     With the loose swinging motion, weary too,     Nor uninclined to rest, a buried fence,     Whose topmost log just shouldered from the snow,     Made me a seat, and thence with heated cheeks,     Grazed by the northwind's edge of stinging ice,     I looked far out upon the snow-bound waste,     The lifting hills and intersecting forests,     The scarce marked courses of the buried streams,     And as I looked lost memory of the frost,     Transfixed with wonder, overborne with joy.	Laughing she lay on the stone that stands       For a rough-hewn step in that sunny place,     And her yellow hair hung down to her hands,       Shadowing over her dimpled face.	Yearning upon the faint rose-curves that flit       About her child-sweet mouth and innocent cheek,       And in her eyes watching with eyes all meek     The light and shadow of laughter, I would sit     Mute, knowing our two souls might never knit;       As if a pale proud lily-flower should seek       The love of some red rose, but could not speak     One word of her blithe tongue to tell of it.	VII.	So rises he, for very gladness weak;       But half in fear that yet the dream may fly,     He touches mutely mouth and brow and cheek;       Till in his ear she 'gins to plead and sigh:     "Dear love, forgive me for that cruel tale,     That stung thine heart and made thy lips so pale."	Yet still the deep thoughts ring       Around and through and through us,     Sweet mights that make us sing,       But bring no resting to us.	His steps are soft, his hands are white and fine;     And still he bears the goblet on whose crown       A hundred jewels in the lamplight shine;     And ever from its edges dripping down       Falls with dark stain the rich and lustrous wine,     Wherefrom through all the chamber's shadowy deeps     A deadly perfume like a vapour creeps.	The hermit hears the strange bright       Murmur of life at play;     In the waste day and the waste night       Times to rebel and to pray.	Like one spell-bound     Caught in the presence of some god, I stood,     Nor felt the keen wind and the deadly air,     But watched the sun go down, and watched the gold     Fade from the town and the withdrawing hills,     Their westward shapes athwart the dusky red     Freeze into sapphire, saw the arc of rose     Rise ever higher in the violet east,     Above the frore front of the uprearing night     Remorsefully soft and sweet.	THE WEAVER.	The smooth tide of sleep,     Rolling across the fields of Attica,     Hath covered all the labouring villages.	Oh, we hear, we hear her singing wherever we roam,     Far, far away in the silence, calling us home.	His words were brief, with bitter fury flung:       'The father's will the child must meekly bear;     I am thy father, thou a girl and young.'	I heard the city time-bells call       Far off in hollow towers,     And one by one with measured fall       Count out the old dead hours;     I felt the march, the silent press       Of time, and held my breath;     I saw the haggard dreadfulness       Of dim old age and death.	How young she looked, and how her smiling lips     Betrayed her happiness.	And so all day above the toiling heads       Of men's poor chimneys, full of impish freaks,     Tearing and twisting in tight-curlèd shreds             The vain unnumbered reeks,     The Winter speeds his fairies forth and mocks       Poor bitten men with laughter icy cold,       Turning the brown of youth to white and old             With hoary-woven locks,     And grey men young with roses in their cheeks.	XXXVII.	Only a steady murmur seems to come     Up from her silentness, as if the land     Were breathing heavily in dreams.	Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.	Oh, I could not see his face,     Nor behold his utmost grace,     Yet I might not change my pace         Fastened by a strange belief;     For his steps were sad and slow,     And his hands hung straight below,     And his head was bowed, as though         Pressed by some immortal grief.	Soul from soul we shrink and part,     And no longer hail each other     With the ancient name of brother     Give the simple poet gold,     And his song will die of cold.	Not least inevitable,     The sad recession of this passionate love,     Whose panting fires, so soon and with such grief,     Burn down to ash.	For perfect love is like a fair green plant,       That fades not with its blossoms, but lives on,     And gentle lovers shall not come to want,       Though fancy with its first mad dream be gone;     Sweet is the flower, whose radiant glory flies,     But sweeter still the green that never dies.	1.F.6.	The laborer toils in gray wise,       Godlike and patient and calm;     The beggar moans; his bleared eyes       Measure the dust in his palm.	And after thaws, when liberal water swells       The bursting eaves, he biddeth drip and grow     The curly horns of ribbèd icicles             In many a beard-like row.	"Nay, Nino, kneel not; let me hear thee speak.	Simple, human, careless, free,     As God made him, he must be:     For the sweetest song of bird     Is the hidden tenor heard     In the dusk, at even-flush,     From the forest's inner hush,     Of the simple hermit thrush.	"O foolish King's son!"	Though his presence seemed so mild,     Yet he led me like a child,     With a yearning strange and wild,         That I dared not turn me back.	Blind multitudes that jar confusedly       At strife, earth's children, will ye never rest       From toils made hateful here, and dawns distressed     With ravelling self-engendered misery?	Such hours, I think, are better than long years     Of brooding loneliness, mind touching mind     To leaping life, and thought sustaining thought,     Till even the darkest chambers of grey time,     His ancient seats, and bolted mysteries,     Open their hoary doors, and at a look     Lay all their treasures bare.	How soon     We know our friends, through all disguise of mood,     Discerning by a subtle touch of spirit     The honest heart within.	Pale season, watcher in unvexed suspense,     Still priestess of the patient middle day,     Betwixt wild March's humored petulence     And the warm wooing of green kirtled May,     Maid month of sunny peace and sober grey,     Weaver of flowers in sunward glades that ring     With murmur of libation to the spring:     As memory of pain, all past, is peace,     And joy, dream-tasted, hath the deepest cheer,     So art thou sweetest of all months that lease     The twelve short spaces of the flying year.	The bridal oxen in their well-filled stalls     Sleep, mindless of the happy weight they drew.	XLVII.

So, fond spirit, beauty-fed,       Turning when your watch is o'er,     Weave a cross above the bed       And a sleep-rune on the floor,     That no evil enter there,       Ugly shapes and dreams beware.	Strange spirit, leave me not too long,       Nor stint to give,     For if my soul have no sweet song,       It cannot live.	AMONG THE MILLET.	Over the fields, where the cool winds sweep,          Black with the mould and brown with the loam,     Where the thin green spears of the wheat are appearing,     And the high-ho shouts from the smoky clearing;       Over the widths where the cloud shadows creep;         Over the fields and the fallows we come;       Over the swamps with their pensive noises,         Where the burnished cup of the marigold gleams;     Skirting the reeds, where the quick winds shiver     On the swelling breast of the dimpled river,       And the blue of the king-fisher hangs and poises,         Watching a spot by the edge of the streams;       By the miles of the fences warped and dyed         With the white-hot noons and their withering fires,     Where the rough bees trample the creamy bosoms     Of the hanging tufts of the elder blossoms,       And the spiders weave, and the grey snakes hide,         In the crannied gloom of the stones and the briers;       Over the meadow lands sprouting with thistle,         Where the humming wings of the blackbirds pass,     Where the hollows are banked with the violets flowering,     And the long-limbed pendulous elms are towering,       Where the robins are loud with their voluble whistle,         And the ground sparrow scurries away through the grass,       Where the restless bobolink loiters and woos         Down in the hollows and over the swells,     Dropping in and out of the shadows,     Sprinkling his music about the meadows,       Whistles and little checks and coos,         And the tinkle of glassy bells;       Into the dim woods full of the tombs         Of the dead trees soft in their sepulchres,     Where the pensive throats of the shy birds hidden,     Pipe to us strangely entering unbidden,       And tenderly still in the tremulous glooms         The trilliums scatter their white-winged stars;       Up to the hills where our tired hearts rest,         Loosen, and halt, and regather their dreams;     Up to the hills, where the winds restore us,     Clearing our eyes to the beauty before us,       Earth with the glory of life on her breast,         Earth with the gleam of her cities and streams.	Musing on life, and what the hours might be,     When love should ripen to maternity,       Then like high flutes in silvery interchange       Ye piped with voices still and sweet and strange,     And ever as ye piped, on every tree     The great buds swelled; among the pensive woods       The spirits of first flowers awoke and flung     From buried faces the close fitting hoods,       And listened to your piping till they fell,       The frail spring-beauty with her perfumed bell,     The wind-flower, and the spotted adder-tongue.	1.E.3.	The organ shook, the music wept;       For sometimes like a wail it crept     In broken moanings down the shadows drear;       And otherwhiles the sound did swell,       And like a sudden tempest fell     Through all the windows wonderful and clear.	MIDSUMMER NIGHT.	The old year's cloaking of brown leaves that bind     The forest floor-ways, plated close and true--     The last love's labour of the autumn wind--     Is broken with curled flower buds white and blue     In all the matted hollows, and speared through     With thousand serpent-spotted blades up-sprung,     Yet bloomless, of the slender adder-tongue.	Ah, Nino, still her breaking heart held true:     Poor lady sad, she had no thought but you.	Come, night, anear;       I'll whisper in thine ear     What makes me so unhappy, full of care;       Dear night, I die       For love that all men buy     With tears, and know not it is dark despair.	XXIII.	Yet no man would have dreamed, who saw us two     That first grey morning on the pier at Crete,     That friendship could have forged thus easily     A bond so subtle and so sure between us;     He, gloomy and austere; I, full of thought     As he, yet in an adverse mood, at ease,     Lifting with lighter hands the lids of life,     Untortured by its riddles; he, whose smiles     Were rare and sudden as the autumn sun;     I, to whom smiles are ever near the lip.	How solidly the brilliant moonlight shines     Into the courts; beneath the colonnades     How dense the shadows.	Gold is but the juggling rod     Of a false usurping god,     Graven long ago in hell     With a sombre stony spell,     Working in the world forever.	For oh, my Love was sunny-lipped and stirred       With all swift light and sound and gloom not long     Retained; I, with dreams weighed, that ever heard       Sad burdens echoing through the loudest throng     She, the wild song of some May-merry bird;       I, but the listening maker of a song.
