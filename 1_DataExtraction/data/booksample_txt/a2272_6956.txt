Beneath   The densest drift a thrusting sheath Of sharp green striving toward the day!	Then, do thou   The Godward impulse room allow To reach its perfect air and food!	I have come back from the crowd, the blinding strife and the tumult, Pain, and the shadow of pain, sorrow in silence endured; Fighting, at last I have fallen, and sought the breast of the Mother,-- Quite cast down I have crept close to the broad sweet earth.	Then he made a feast.	So only to see you, to hear you, To speak with you, Love, to be near you,-- I should reckon this life, well content.	Therefore he stood secure.	Summers and summers have come, and gone with the flight of the swallow; Sunshine and thunder have been, storm, and winter, and frost, Many and many a sorrow has all but died from remembrance, Many a dream of joy fall'n in the shadow of pain.	ON THE CREEK.	Well I remember the piles of blocks and ropes, and the net-reels Wound with the beaded nets, dripping and dark from the sea!	KHARTOUM.	The slow smoke-wreaths of vapor to and fro Wave, and unweave, and gather and build again.	I found its tongue was withered, poor thing!	How by PenÃ«us the sward breaks into saffron and blue!	Sweet were red-mouthed plenty mindless grown of pain.	L'ENVOI.	But our hearts change; the spirit dulls its edge   In the chill contact with reality; These vanished like the foam-bells on the sedge:   I sing one burden now, my song is Liberty.	Path by Which her feet have gone,   Still you climb the windy hill, Still the hillside fronts the dawn,   Fronts the clustering village still.	Dream-clouds gather and pass Of painless remembrance of pain.	Not distance parts us, Dear; but this dim force,   Intangible, holds us helpless, hushed with pain,   Dumb with the dark, blind with the gusts of rain!	Not all battle is life, But a little respite and peace May fold us round as a fleece Soft-woven for all men's wear.	How the nipping wind does drive Through yon tree-tops, bare and lean,   Till their shadow seems alive,-- Patters through the bars, and falls, Shivering, on the floor and walls!	But the hyacinth beds were a-bloom.	THE ISLES--AN ODE.	Monks of centuries ago Wander back to see to-night   How the old place looks.--Hello!	Clear, broad, white forehead, crowned low down with hair   Darker than night, more soft than sleep or tears.	Near about sunset the crane will journey homeward above them; Round them, under the moon, all the calm night long, Winnowing soft gray wings of marsh-owls wander and wander, Now to the broad, lit marsh, now to the dusk of the dike.	Sweeter yet behold--a sore-bewildering vision!	Laurels for song!	her brow casts off each servile trace-- The wave's cool breath hath won her thoughts astray.	Here they foot it, pacing slow,   Monk-like, one behind another!-- Don't you hear me?	WINTER GERANIUMS.	Faithful was he, aye, I ween,   Pitiful, and kind, and wise; But in mindful moods I've seen   Flame enough in those sunk eyes!	OFF PELORUS.	Seethes the startled sea now from the surging blade.	Hands of chance and change have marred, or moulded, or broken, Busy with spirit or flesh, all I most have adored; Even the bosom of Earth is strewn with heavier shadows,-- Only in these green hills, aslant to the sea, no change!	As shrinks in the rains of spring the snow, So shrank the monster beneath that blow, "Till scarce the bulk of a bull he stood.	Praised be Christ, whose timely Hand Plucked from out the fire this brand!	Here where the road that has climbed from the inland valleys and woodlands, Dips from the hill-tops down, straight to the base of the hills,-- Here, from my vantage-ground, I can see the scattering houses, Stained with time, set warm in orchards, and meadows, and wheat, Dotting the broad bright slopes outspread to southward and eastward, Wind-swept all day long, blown by the south-east wind.	Save what the night-wind woke of sweet   And solemn sound, I heard alone The sleepless ocean's ceaseless beat,   The surge's monotone.	For Time Forgets his cunning and assails in vain   Her whose name rings along the poet's rhyme.	Renewed the wavering courage, Tense the unstrung nerves, steadfast the faltering knees Weary no more, nor faint, nor grieved at heart, nor despairing, Hushed in the earth's green lap, lulled to slumber and dreams!	TO A LADY, AFTER HEARING HER READ KEATS' "NIGHTINGALE."	Many folk are out to-night.	Well we guess the song, the subtle words and burning,   Sung to him, the subtle king of burning words.	Soon, thro' their dew-wet frames, in the live keen freshness of morning, Out of the teeth of the dawn blows back the awakening wind.	A sundown rose         Delays and glows   O'er yon spired peak's remoter snows.	And crouched thus at her rescued feet   Save her low breath, I heard alone The sleepless ocean's ceaseless beat,   The surge's monotone.	Farewell!	No wind from out the solemn wells of night   But hath its burden of strange messages,   Tormenting for interpreter; nor less              The wizard light That steals from noon-stilled waters, woven in shade,   Beckons somewhither, with cool fingers slim.	Where the blue lake-water raves,   Still the plover pipe and flee.	Farewell!	But this dream is in vain, is in vain; I will dream you one other.	The supreme mind Of Shakspere took their sovereignty, and smiled.	Sweet is thy voice; but yet, but yet-- Of all 'twere sweetest to forget!	Heart of my heart, tho' life   Front us with storm, Love will outlast the strife,   More pure, more warm.	Again that faint wind swept my face--   With hideous menace swept my eyes.	How the Eternal's unconcern of time,-- Omnipotence that hath not dreamed of haste,-- Is graven in granite-moulding aeons' gloom; Is told in stony record of the roar Of long Silurian storms, and tempests huge Scourging the circuit of Devonian seas; Is whispered in the noiseless mists, the gray Soft drip of clouds about rank fern-forests, Through dateless terms that stored the layered coal; Is uttered hoarse in strange Triassic forms Of monstrous life; or stamped in ice-blue gleams Athwart the death-still years of glacial sleep!	Heart, spirit, and body, and brain, Thou art utterly mine, as I thine; But the love of the flesh, tho' at first When I saw you and loved you it burst With the love of the spirit one flame, Neither greater nor less, but the same, Is yet finite, attains not the height Of the spirit enfranchised, and must With the body slip back into dust.	See the King!	How yon patch of freezing sky   Echoes back their bell-ringings!	My feet again, some days gone by.	I had loved you many a day, Yet never had fate drawn nigh   My way to your way.	O where the frost that chills, Whilst these rich blooms burn red about my face,   Luring me out across the irised hills Where Autumn broods o'er purple deeps of space!	His days unmeasured ages, His designs Unfold through age-long silences, through surge Of world upheaval, coming to their aim As swerveless in fit time as tho' His finger But yesterday ordained, and wrought to-day.	Ah, this mortal flesh is weak!	And now upon the homeless pack And paling stream arose a noiseless wind Out of the yellow west awhile, and stirred The branches down the valley; then blew off To eastward toward the long gray straits, and died Into the dark, beyond the utmost verge.	It is so long ago; and men well nigh Forget what gladness was, and how the earth Gave corn in plenty, and the rivers fish, And the woods meat, before he went away.	They entreated with tears.	Won't you speak?	Tho' strenuously with breath divine inspired, To thy strait law is due thy deathless line.	Come to pray--and go to sleep!	Afraid, where no fear was.	My fingers would with laughing scorn let fall   That poor half-love so many lovers heed.	But there comes an hour Of fitness perfect and unfettered mood,   When splits her husk the finer sense with power,              And--yon their palm-trees tower!	Fathomless dusk by night, the day lets in   Glimmer of emerald,--thus those eyes of hers!	Their tresses on the summer wind they flung; And some a shining yellow fleece let fall For the sun's envy; others with white hands Lifted a glooming wealth of locks more dark Than deepest wells, but purple in the sun.	Nay, what were life,   Save thou inspire it, That I should bid my soul   Greatly desire it?	CONCERNING CUTHBERT THE MONK.	Tho' faint souls fear the keen confronting sun,   And fain would bid the morn of splendor wait; Tho' dreamers, rapt in starry visions, cry   "Lo, yon thy future, yon thy faith, thy fame!"	Even as thus they played, and some lithe maids Upreached white arms to grasp the berried ash, And, plucking the bright bunches, shed them wide By red ripe handfuls, not far off I saw With long stride making down the beechy glade, Clear-eyed, with firm lips laughing, at his heels The clamor of his fifty deep-tongued hounds, Actaeon.	Dearest, to thy distant chamber   Wings my soul its flight.	Many their speeding herald, whose light feet Make pause at wayside brooks, and fords of streams,   Leaving transfigured by an effluence fleet              Those wayfarers they meet.	I.
