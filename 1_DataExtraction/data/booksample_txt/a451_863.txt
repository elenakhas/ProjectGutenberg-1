You wish to believe he committed the crime.	An old woman came and opened it.	I took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see, and went myself in search of Dorcas.	I tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me.	However that may be, my father was broken-hearted.	Cocoa would be quite powerless to mask it.” One of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.	Nobody came.	“See you, one should not ask for outside proof—no, reason should be enough.	Mace must have been mistaken.” The Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said: “Mr.	“Never mind, old chap.	I remembered that Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way.	I have need of reflection.	If he was going to take the matter that way, it was no good arguing with him.	But you’ve been on the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little hints.	We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us of being intelligent at all.” I acquiesced.	I—I wish I did.” The boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.	“You couldn’t call it a suspicion,” I murmured.	“Could not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?” Poirot shook his head.	“Pardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.” He turned to me earnestly.	He is endeavouring to make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as against John—and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed.” Detective-inspector Japp was the first witness called when the trial was reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly.	“What?” John and the lawyer looked at him startled.	There was no strychnine present.” I heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.	I will take the latch-key.” CHAPTER III.	Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk, of coming in here.	“Then he is very sure.	You’re not a connoisseur, are you, Hastings?” I shook my head.	“And this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about all over the country!” I cried indignantly.	“Where I come from, who I was before I married John—anything, in fact?	Do you?” I was compelled to shake my head.	Of course one has to treat him as usual—but, hang it all, one’s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat with a possible murderer!” Poirot nodded sympathetically.	His face was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck me afresh.	That was only natural.” “Yes,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “it was only natural.” He opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to me.	.	The prisoner had, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there vainly for half an hour had returned home.	Would he, or would he not have had plenty of time to remove and destroy them?” “Yes.” “Was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy or light?” “Heavyish.” “In other words, it was winter underclothing.	Use your warrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp.	In this case, surely, the truth was only too plain and apparent.	Now your help may be very valuable to me.	Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday, Dorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong with Mrs. Inglethorp’s bell?” Dorcas looked very surprised.	We are face to face with an entirely new problem.	I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a glib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh!	“_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_,” said Poirot, bowing as though he were a celebrity about to deliver a lecture, “I have asked you to come here all together, for a certain object.	Sir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the unscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two questions.	“I mean,” explained Poirot, “you are sure it was bolted, and not merely locked?” “Oh, I see what you mean.	We shall be pinched at first, of course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole financially myself.	Still, the Johnnies will wait now.” In the general relief at Inglethorp’s approaching departure, we had the most genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy.	Yet that is what it looks like.” Poirot nodded reflectively.	I told him, what was true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him more, but that I was not in any way what the world calls ‘in love’ with him.	“What do you think of that?” I scrutinized the fragment.	And that little curious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally, we put it here!” He made an extravagant gesture with his hand.	My evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr. Bauerstein.	I met him.” John flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which was too much for Poirot’s feelings.	“And you remember nothing at all?	He stretched out his hands.	The spacing of the plants, also, is perfect.	I must say——” But I stopped suddenly.	I glanced sideways at him.	All the doors had been bolted on the inside.	She was able to speak in short gasps.	Then came the sensation of the day.	If I’m not greatly mistaken, he’s got something up his sleeve.	I shall go round the long way through the woods.” The woods round Styles were very beautiful.	But, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence—or rather lack of evidence.	He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as though he expected no great results from it.	One was to Miss Howard, and one was to Mr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don’t think I remember, sir—oh, yes, one was to Ross’s, the caterers in Tadminster.	“Do you understand now, monsieur?” “No.	“Started the moment I got the wire.	I rather resented his not taking me into his confidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was driving at.	Most comic!	I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate any clues.	She nodded.	I will put down my little case until I need it.” He did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised proceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and precipitated the despatch-case on the floor.	She could not be implicated—otherwise I should have heard some hint of it.	Of the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and sympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish.	“Miss Howard,” I explained.	This employment requires precision of the fingers.	She was very generous, but she always wanted a return.	She was very pale, but smiling.	Listen.” And I then told him of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed.	“I am sorry for that,” he said.	There was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before she answered: “Yes, that is so.” “And the boudoir window was open, was it not?” Surely her face grew a little paler as she answered: “Yes.” “Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as they were raised in anger.	Everything matters.” “I know.	Isn’t he coming back to-day?” “I don’t know.
