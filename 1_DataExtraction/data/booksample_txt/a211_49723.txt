There, all around, the gentlest breezes stray;   There gentle music melts on every spray;   Creation’s mildest charms are there combin’d;   Extremes are only in the master’s mind.	Heavens!	In vain, to charm thy ravish’d sight,     A thousand gifts would fortune send;   In vain, to drive thee from the right,     A thousand sorrows urg’d thy end:   Like some well-fashion’d arch thy patience stood,   And purchas’d strength from its increasing load.	Or Jack had wanted eyes to gaze.	Your worships must know,   That a few days ago   An order went out,   For the foot-guards so stout   To wear tails in high taste--   Twelve inches at least:   Now, I’ve got him a scale   To measure each tail;   To lengthen a short tail,   And a long one to curtail.)	I now perceive, my dear brother, the wisdom of your humble choice.	Stand fast,--and let our tyrants see   That fortitude is victory.	Yes!	Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear,   For honour forms the social temper here:   Honour, that praise which real merit gains,   Or even imaginary worth obtains,   Here passes current--paid from hand to hand,   It shifts, in splendid traffic, round the land;   From courts to camps, to cottages it strays,   And all are taught an avarice of praise--   They please, are pleas’d, they give to get esteem,   Till, seeming bless’d, they grow to what they seem.	Or rather, Love’s delights despising,   Haste to raptures ever rising;     Wine shall bless the brave and free.	So bless’d a life these thoughtless realms display;   Thus idly busy rolls their world away.	Thus ’tis with all--their chief and constant care   Is to seem everything but what they are.	down--down to the ground:     She sinks, she groans, she dies.	MAN _Speaker._   The hardy veteran, after struck the sight,     Scarr’d, mangled, maim’d in every part;   Lopp’d of his limbs in many a gallant fight,     In nought entire--except his heart;   Mute for a while, and sullenly distrest,   At last the impetuous sorrow fir’d his breast:       “Wild is the whirlwind rolling         O’er Afric’s sandy plain,       And wild the tempest howling         Along the billow’d main;     But every danger felt before--     The raging deep, the whirlwind’s roar--     Less dreadful struck me with dismay,     Than what I feel this fatal day.	Such petty anecdotes as these are scarce worth     printing; and, were it not for the busy disposition of some of     your correspondents, the public should never have known that     he owes me the hint of his ballad, or that I am obliged to     his friendship and learning for communications of a much more     important nature.	Eternal blessings crown my earliest friend,   And round his dwelling guardian saints attend:   Bless’d be that spot, where cheerful guests retire   To pause from toil, and trim their evening fire;   Bless’d that abode, where want and pain repair,   And every stranger finds a ready chair;   Bless’d be those feasts, with simple plenty crown’d,   Where all the ruddy family around   Laugh at the jests or pranks that never fail,   Or sigh with pity at some mournful tale,   Or press the bashful stranger to his food,   And learn the luxury of doing good.	MISS CATLEY.	Fir’d at the sound, my genius spreads her wing,   And flies where Britain courts the western spring;   Where lawns extend that scorn Arcadian pride,   And brighter streams than fam’d Hydaspes glide.	[52] Banks and Solander.	The dome where pleasure holds her midnight reign,   Here, richly deck’d, admits the gorgeous train--   Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square,   The rattling chariots clash, the torches glare:   Sure scenes like these no troubles e’er annoy;   Sure these denote one universal joy!	see foremost of the captive choir,   The master-prophet grasps his full-ton’d lyre;   Mark where he sits, with executing art,   Feels for each tone, and speeds it to the heart.	[47]             OLIVER GOLDSMITH.	This seems a barren and a dangerous coast.	Moreover, Mercury had a failing;   Well!	I do not think there     is any great resemblance between the two pieces in question.	Yes, the Epilogue, my dear.	Indeed, so much has been poured out of late on the other side of the question, that, merely for the sake of novelty and variety, one would sometimes wish to be in the right.	[Illustration]     To men of other minds my fancy flies,   Embosom’d in the deep where Holland lies.	Seen opulence, her grandeur to maintain,   Lead stern depopulation in her train--   And over fields, where scatter’d hamlets rose,   In barren solitary pomp repose?	See how she moves along with every grace,   While soul-brought tears steal down each shining face.	CHORUS OF VIRGINS.

[Illustration: TRANSLATION FROM SCARRÒN.]	O Peace of Mind, angelic guest!	_Air._   As panting flies the hunted hind,     Where brooks refreshing stray;   And rivers through the valley wind,     That stop the hunter’s way:   Thus we, O Lord, alike distrest,     For streams of mercy long;   Streams which can cheer the sore-opprest,     And overwhelm the strong.

[Illustration]   This dog and man at first were friends;     But, when a pique began,   The dog, to gain some private ends,     Went mad, and bit the man.	And kiss’d her thoughtless babes with many a tear,   And clasp’d them close, in sorrow doubly dear--   Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief,   In all the silent manliness of grief.	At length for joy prepare;   I read your looks, and see compliance there.	Or why those harps on yonder willows hung?	Take courage, come, do!”   “Who--I?	Good heavens!	The Epilogue?	Each nobler aim, repress’d by long control,   Now sinks at last, or feebly mans the soul;   While low delights, succeeding fast behind,   In happier meanness occupy the mind.	A window, patch’d with paper, lent a ray,   That dimly show’d the state in which he lay:   The sanded floor that grits beneath the tread;   The humid wall with paltry pictures spread;   The royal game of goose was there in view,   And the twelve rules the royal martyr drew;   The seasons, fram’d with listing, found a place,   And brave Prince William show’d his lamp-black face.	But now the sounds of population fail,   No cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale,   No busy steps the grass-grown footway tread,   For all the bloomy flush of life is fled--   All but yon widow’d, solitary thing,   That feebly bends beside the plashy spring;   She, wretched matron, forc’d in age, for bread,   To strip the brook with mantling cresses spread,   To pick her wintry faggot from the thorn,   To seek her nightly shed, and weep till morn--   She only left of all the harmless train,   The sad historian of the pensive plain!	In that secure, serene retreat,   Where all the humble, all the great,     Promiscuously recline;   Where, wildly huddled to the eye,   The beggar’s pouch and prince’s purple lie,     May every bliss be thine.	His fools have their follies so lost in a crowd   Of virtues and feelings, that folly grows proud;   And coxcombs, alike in their failings alone,   Adopting his portraits, are pleas’d with their own.	Each day, each hour, her name I’ll bless,     My morning and my evening song;   And when in death my vows shall cease,     My children shall the note prolong.	Blest spirit thou, whose fame, just born to bloom,   Shall spread and flourish from the tomb,     How hast thou left mankind for heaven!	’tis rapture all, and nameless bliss;   Ye gods!	[36] Sir Robert Walpole.	“And, ah!	Him I obey, whom Heaven itself obeys;   Hopeless of pleasing, yet inclin’d to please.	“There’s the parish of Edmonton offers forty pounds--there’s the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, offers forty pounds--there’s the parish of Tyburn offers forty pounds: I shall have all that, if I convict them.”   “But consider their case, it may yet be your own;   And see how they kneel: is your heart made of stone?”   This moves: so at last I agree to relent,   For ten pounds in hand, and ten pounds to be spent.	Imagination fondly stoops to trace   The parlour splendours of that festive place;   The whitewash’d wall, the nicely sanded floor,   The varnish’d clock that click’d behind the door--   The chest contriv’d a double debt to pay,   A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day--   The pictures plac’d for ornament and use,   The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose--   The hearth, except when winter chill’d the day,   With aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel gay--   While broken tea-cups, wisely kept for show,   Rang’d o’er the chimney, glisten’d in a row.	[42]]   Here lies poor Ned Purdon, from misery freed,     Who long was a booksellers’ hack;   He led such a damnable life in this world,     I don’t think he’ll wish to come back.	[Illustration: PROLOGUE TO “ZOBEIDE,” A TRAGEDY.	[Illustration]   FIRST PROPHET.	[26] The Rev.	[Illustration]     As some fair female, unadorn’d and plain,   Secure to please while youth confirms her reign,   Slights every borrow’d charm that dress supplies,   Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes--   But when those charms are pass’d, for charms are frail,   When time advances, and when lovers fail--   She then shines forth, solicitous to bless,   In all the glaring impotence of dress.	And should we mourn?	Thine, freedom, thine the blessings pictur’d here;   Thine are those charms that dazzle and endear;   Too bless’d indeed were such without alloy,   But, foster’d even by freedom, ills annoy.	[Illustration] FOOTNOTES: [53] Written by Mrs. Charlotte Lennox.	SECOND PRIEST.	Down with her, Lord, to lick the dust,     Before yon setting sun;   Serve her as she hath serv’d the just:     ’Tis fix’d--it shall be done.	Groans, weeping friends, indeed, and gloomy sables,   May oft distract us with their sad solemnity:   The preparation is the executioner.	On the grave of Augusta these garlands be plac’d,     We’ll rifle the spring of its earliest bloom;   And there shall the cowslip and primrose be cast,     And the new-blossom’d thorn shall whiten her tomb.	Skill’d in no other arts was she,   But dressing, patching, repartee;   And, just as humour rose or fell,   By turns a slattern or a belle.	Calm is my soul, nor apt to rise in arms,   Except when fast-approaching danger warms;   But, when contending chiefs blockade the throne,   Contracting regal power, to stretch their own--   When I behold a factious band agree   To call it freedom when themselves are free--   Each wanton judge new penal statutes draw,   Laws grind the poor, and rich men rule the law--   The wealth of climes, where savage nations roam,   Pillag’d from slaves, to purchase slaves at home--   Fear, pity, justice, indignation start,   Tear off reserve, and bare my swelling heart;   Till, half a patriot, half a coward grown,   I fly from petty tyrants to the throne.	No product here the barren hills afford,   But man and steel, the soldier and his sword;   No vernal blooms their torpid rocks array,   But winter lingering chills the lap of May;   No zephyr fondly sues the mountain’s breast,   But meteors glare, and stormy glooms invest.	And now, behold, to yonder bank they bear   A pallid corse, and rest the body there.	Yes, brother!	FIRST PROPHET.	Robert François Damiens was an enthusiast who attempted to stab Louis XV.	Ye fields of Sharon, dress’d in flowery pride;   Ye plains, where Jordan rolls its glassy tide;   Ye hills of Lebanon, with cedars crown’d;   Ye Gilead groves, that fling perfumes around:   These hills how sweet!	Death, when unmask’d, shows me a friendly face,   And is a terror only at a distance;   For as the line of life conducts me on   To death’s great court, the prospect seems more fair:   ’Tis Nature’s kind retreat, that’s always open   To take us in, when we have drain’d the cup   Of life, or worn our days to wretchedness.	SECOND PROPHET.	I answer, no, no--for he always was wiser;   Too courteous, perhaps, or obligingly flat?
