Riding thither, he raised himself in his stirrups and, reaching up, tapped upon the panes; and, in a while, the casement was opened and a man peered forth, a drowsy being, touzled of head and round of eye.	"Cap'n Beverley's craft, ain't it?"	A very different person he looked from the neat, well-groomed Peterby of a week ago, what with the rough, ill-fitting clothes he wore and the fur cap pulled low over his brows; the gentleman's gentleman had vanished quite, and in his stead was a nondescript character such as might have been met with anywhere along the River, or lounging in shadowy corners.	'Hi, Corporal,' yells Crichton, 'ten pounds if you can get me over the breastwork--quick's the word!'	I am only a very --humble fellow.	"Mm!	said Barnabas.	"I am, therefore, going to make you an offer--" "Which I must--refuse."	And Mr. Shrig positively chuckled and rubbed his chubby hands together; but all at once, he shook his head gloomily, and glancing at Barnabas, sighed deeply.	But hereupon the fussy gentleman, leaning over, taps Mottle-face upon the shoulder.	Talk to me of Cleone."	'e gets made a corp' afore 'e knows it.	Then, as one in a dream, Peterby took up the money, counted it, buttoned it into his pocket, and crossed to the door; but there he paused and turned.	he cried heartily, "pray forgive this horribly unseasonable visit, but--under the circumstances--I felt it my duty to--ah--to drop in on you, my dear fellow."	"Only, if it's time you're going to ask for--it's no go, my boy--hard-fisted old rasper, you know the saying,--(Bible, I think), figs, b'gad, and thistles, bread from stones, but no mercy from Jasper Gaunt."	As he turned towards the inn, Peterby interposed.	Come, what's the word?"	"Mr. Barnabas Beverley,--Mr. Ronald Barrymaine."	Why, I still owe Gaunt, as far as I can figure it up, about eighty thousand pounds, which is a deuced lot more than it sounds.	said Natty Bell, shaking his head, "but that's only nat'ral, arter all, yes--a bit palish, p'r'aps, but, man Jack--what o' that?"	Beat the 'Rascal,' Jerny?	"Probably because there are no pugilists left in England, worth the name," said Barnabas.	the Wise Ones grow impatient for my song; I hear them calling from the trees, and must begone.	"Are you angry?"	So, perforce, Barnabas came back, and standing again beneath the finger-post, gave the Duchess her very small piece of embroidery.	And to-night I met another who sought to take this 'shorter way'--but he was young, and for the young there is always hope.	And, as for the others, let me tell you when a fellow has a one-eyed being with bristles hanging about his place, he isn't likely to be over particular as to his p's and q's, no, damme!	Being come opposite to them, he paused to mop at his red face with a neckerchief of vivid hue, which done, he touched the brim of the glazed hat, and though separated from them by no more than the hedge and ditch, immediately let out another roar--for all the world as though he had been hailing the maintop of a Seventy-four in a gale of wind.	"The only one, with the exception of yours obediently, who has not deserted him in his adversity."	D'ye get that?	And, sure enough, hurried feet were heard ascending; whereupon Mr. Smivvle uttered a startled exclamation, and, motioning Barnabas to be seated in the dingiest corner, strode quickly to the door, and thus came face to face with Ronald Barrymaine upon the threshold.	"Are the horses all right, Bev?"	The Marquis and the Viscount, racing knee and knee, have increased their twelve yards by half, and now, as Barnabas watches, down go their heads, in go their spurs, and away go chestnut and bay, fast and faster, take off almost together, land fairly, and are steadied down again to a rolling gallop.	But, as I was saying, you may have noticed that Chichester is not altogether--friendly towards you?"	tramp!	Signed:      NATL.	The sound of it is always in my ears.	"By the way," pursued the Captain, "we three are dining together at my club; may I have a cover laid for you, Mr.	said Barnabas; "to buy a house will be more original, at least.	said a voice near by; and looking thitherward, Barnabas beheld the Duchess seated at a small table beneath a shady tree, and further screened by a tall hedge; a secluded corner, far removed from the throng, albeit a most excellent place for purposes of observation, commanding as it did a wide view of lawns and terraces.	He stood a moment hesitating as one at a sudden loss, then crossing to the unconscious form of Barrymaine, he set the pistol under his lax hand, turned, and vanished into the shadow.	"I remember," sighed Barnabas.	Certainly not, sir!	_Barnabas_.	"Oh?"	she sighed, with a helpless gesture of her white hands, "to hurry away like this, without a word!	"But indeed I was--quite an infant, Fanny."	In your pocket, sir,--the left one!"	And life has given me my heart's desire, and for you, my brave, strong, honorable man--the Future lies all before you."	Hence, my sweet Clo, with her unfailing solicitude   for me, having observed me flying signals of distress, has   contrived to put it into my head that your presence might   have a calming effect.	"That I poach that I may live to--poach again, sir.	And your hands are very large.	"And have served many gentlemen in my time."	Not a word about money,--so downstairs Bristles must continue to sit until--" "If," said Barnabas diffidently, "if you would allow me to lend--" "No, no, Bev--though I swear it's uncommon good of you.	"Hum!"	and what might you have been doing in the hedge now?"	said the Duchess, softly.	"Nothing, my dear boy, nothing in the world,--except that until to-day you have been my friend, and have honored me with your confidence."	Secondly, because I have bought a horse--such a horse   as I have only dreamed of ever possessing,--all fire and   courage, with a long powerful action--Oh, Natty Bell,   if you could but see him!	"How?"	come forth, I summon ye.	"Yes, sir," said Peterby, and, taking up the pistol, he went out, closing the door behind him.	"Do you know him--have you ever met him?"	she exclaimed, speaking in a whisper.

John Barty pursed up his lips into a soundless whistle and went on filling his pipe.	"You thrashed--Carnaby!	He is very proud of his son, it seems, and he even showed me a letter this son had written him from the 'George' inn at Southwark.	"I think," said he slowly, "yes, I think my cane could not have a worthier end than splintering on your villain's back, Mr.	and, flinging the pistol far out into the River, he approached Mr. Chichester, staggering a little, but with fists clenched.	Before the hearth stood John Barty's favorite arm-chair and into this, after some little demur, Barnabas sank, and stretched out his booted legs to the fire.	"Love," exclaimed the Viscount again, and frowning this time; "now, who the devil should she be in love with!"	Surely no man could lie, whose eyes were so truthful and steadfast.	"Thank you--no," answered Barnabas, "Captain Slingsby is my friend!"	"Ah!--would you?"	"But to-night," said Barnabas, gentle of voice but resolute of eye, "to-night--I go with you."	See--here we have three folds and a tuck, then--oh, Jupiter, it's a positive work of art, --how the deuce d'you tie it?	CHAPTER XXXI WHICH DESCRIBES SOME OF THE EVILS OF VINDICTIVENESS Barnabas stumbled suddenly, dropped his cane, saw his hat spin through the air and roll on before him; staggered sideways, was brought up by a wall, and turning, found three men about him, --evil-faced men whose every move and look held a menace.	"And I also," said Mr. Chichester, opening his betting-book.	Peep inside of it."	saying which, Barnabas sat down, and, keeping one pistol levelled, laid the other within Mr. Chichester's reach.	But still Mr. Smivvle hesitated, and ever the small sound grew bigger and louder.	"No?"
