"Nothing, my dear," said she; "but my spirits are so discomposed with the dreadful scene I saw last night, that a dream, which at another time I should have laughed at, hath shocked me.	cries Amelia.	"He knows nothing of my being here," answered Booth; "but why should I refuse to see him if he should be kind enough to come hither to me?	"I have computed it myself," said she; "and I believe all we have in the world, besides our bare necessary apparel, would produce about sixty pounds: and suppose, my dear," said she, "while we have that little sum, we should think of employing it some way or other, to procure some small subsistence for ourselves and our family.	As soon as she was gone the pawnbroker, taking the picture in his hand, cried out, _Upon my word, this is the handsomest face I ever saw in my life!_ I desired him to let me look on the picture, which he readily did--and I no sooner cast my eyes upon it, than the strong resemblance struck me, and I knew it to be Mrs.	However, she had some little awe of the captain; and for fear of being in the wrong did not interfere, but shut the door and turned the key.	At length he came to this determination, to go according to his appointment, to argue the matter with the lady, and to convince her, if possible, that, from a regard to his honour only, he must discontinue her acquaintance.	The whole relation he gave is not very material; but, among other things, he produced one of his hands, which Satan had made use of to write upon, as the moderns do on a card, and had sent his compliments to the priests for the number of souls which the wicked examples of their lives daily sent to hell.	Nothing then was farther from the doctor's mind than the conception of any anger towards Amelia.	The regiment into which Trent purchased was the same with that in which Booth likewise served; the one being an ensign, and the other a lieutenant, in the two additional companies.	This was a favour very easily obtained; for Amelia instantly ran down-stairs, exulting in the goodness of her husband for returning so soon, though half an hour was already elapsed beyond the time in which he promised to return.	At which the doctor and Booth burst into a loud laugh; and Amelia, though fearful of giving her friend offence, could not forbear a gentle smile.	"Indeed, my dear," cries the serjeant, "you had better not dispute with the doctor; for, upon my word, he will be too hard for you."	If you have anything to say, tell it me, and do not be afraid of my anger; for I think I may promise to forgive whatever it was possible you should do."	That day in his walks Booth met with an old brother-officer, who had served with him at Gibraltar, and was on half-pay as well as himself.	Chapter iv.	"Do you recollect," said she, "no woman that you have used with the highest barbarity--I will not say ingratitude?"	"I am sure I did not intend it; and your honour hath drawn it from me unawares."	"It is certainly the most cruel of all injuries," said Booth.	Trent pressed very much the drinking another bottle, but Booth absolutely refused, and presently afterwards they parted, not extremely well satisfied with each other.	You will then find, I am afraid, that honour hath no more skill in cookery than Shakspear tells us it hath in surgery.	Thus they become bad subjects, bad relations, bad friends, and bad men.	cries the doctor; "indeed I will not suffer that noble word to be so basely and barbarously prostituted.	Amelia sent Booth to call up the maid of the house, in order to lend her assistance; but before his return Mrs. Atkinson began to come to herself; and soon after, to the inexpressible joy of the serjeant, it was discovered she had no wound.	The doctor, with a very kind voice and countenance, desired her to speak.	"I beg, my dear," cried she, "_you_ will say nothing upon these subjects--I hope _you_ at least do not despise my understanding."	do either of you think that you have made an union to endure for ever?	He told her likewise all that he had done and suffered to conceal his transgression from her knowledge.	Booth begged him to explain himself.	"I have my treasure too; and am so much a miser, that no force shall ever tear me from it."	Let me beseech you, madam, let not that dear heart, whose tenderness is so inclined to compassionate the miseries of others, be hardened only against the sufferings which itself occasions.	Let me be an accessory to what the doctor hath said.	A pathetic scene now ensued between the husband and wife, which would not, perhaps, please many readers to see drawn at too full a length.	Now to deny a man the preferment which he merits, and to give it to another man who doth not merit it, is a manifest act of injustice, and is consequently inconsistent with both honour and honesty.	Mrs. Trent had been to visit Mrs. Booth on the masquerade evening, which visit Mrs. Booth had not yet returned.	One of them died soon after, and fulfilled his promise.	they cut my very heart- strings when you spoke then; for I had then lost this little all.	"How came you not to carry him directly to Newgate, as you promised me?"	"Pray, sir," cries the doctor, turning to the other, "are you a lord?"	"I suppose it is the devil," cries Jack; "for here are two of his livery servants already."	Doctor Harrison received the letter that afternoon, and immediately complied with Amelia's request in visiting her.	"It is over with him, d--n me!	Instead of discouraging wickedness to the utmost of their power, both are too apt to connive at it.	One discovery, however, the doctor made, and that was, that the surgeon was a very ignorant, conceited fellow, and knew nothing of his profession.	"I have not yet that power," answered the young clergyman; "for I am only in deacon's orders."	Amelia therefore broke open the letter, and read as follows: "SIR,--After what hath passed between us, I need only tell you that I know you supped this very night alone with Miss Matthews: a fact which will upbraid you sufficiently, without putting me to that trouble, and will very well account for my desiring the favour of seeing you to- morrow in Hyde-park at six in the morning.	upon which Mrs. Betty was immediately stopt in her vehicle, and Booth and his myrmidons laid hold of her.	and married for love too," answered the other; "but he hath loved away all his love for her long ago, and now, he says, she makes as fine an object of hatred.	"Yes, he is," said the bailiff; "he desired to speak with the doctor very much, and they have been praying together almost this hour."	Chapter iii.	He instantly gave the alarm of stop thief, stop coach!	and is not a breach of trust felony, and the worst felony too?"	brother James," cries Bath; "angry!--I love you, brother, and have obligations to you.	Amelia answered that she liked her the better: for, indeed, in her present disposition, Amelia was as much exasperated against wicked women as the virtuous mistress of the house, or any other virtuous woman could be.	and it was chiefly owing to the avoiding this error that Oliver Cromwell carried the reputation of England higher than it ever was at any other time.	These were lovers, and great men.	She then related the serjeant's dream, with all the consequences that attended it.	"I hope she is not disordered by the masquerade," cries the doctor.	"No, indeed, sir," answered Booth, "nor that they are worthy thirty either."	Could I have seen you sometimes, I believe the fear of offending you would have kept my love for ever buried in my own bosom; but, to be totally excluded even from the sight of what my soul doats on is what I cannot bear.	Now, therefore, if you will act the part of a wise man, I will undertake that you shall make your fortune without the least injury to the chastity of Mrs.	As soon as Mrs. Atkinson recovered her breath she cried out, "O, Mrs. Booth!	Can such a mind as this be fixed on things above?	"I am satisfied," cries the doctor.	"Very probably!"	She desisted therefore from going any further, and, after some short stay longer, took her leave, with many expressions of concern, which, however, great as it was, left her heart and her mouth together before she was out of the house.	"In the next place," said she, "I must have two hundred guineas within these two or three days."	"And yet this is the Virgil," answered the doctor, "that you are so fond of, who hath made you all of the neuter gender; or, as we say in English, he hath made mere animals of you; for, if we translate it thus,     "Woman is a various and changeable animal, "there will be no fault, I believe, unless in point of civility to the ladies."	I told you I must distress my circumstances, and I will distress them this once on your account, and on the account of these poor little babes.	"I do not approve ridicule," said the son, "on such subjects."	I am sure you would if you knew the compunction with which I left you to go to the most worthless, the most infamous.	"How can you be so cruel, madam?"	It falls out very luckily too at this time, when you have it in your power so greatly to oblige us."	art, as an old friend of mine calls it.	Here Bath interfered, and explained this affair in the manner in which it happened, and with which the reader is already acquainted.	But, though he was a gay man, he was in reality so fond of his Amelia, that he thought of no other woman; wherefore, though not absolutely a Joseph, as we have already seen, yet could he not be guilty of premeditated inconstancy.	cries the colonel, "I know nothing of her."	He is your friend as well as myself, and we will never let Mr. James rest till he hath got you a commission in England."	and says of him,      Hic niger est, hunc tu, Romane, caveto."	Must he not himself think, if ever he reflects at all, that so glorious a Master will disdain and disown a servant who is the dutiful tool of a court-favourite, and employed either as the pimp of his pleasure, or sometimes, perhaps, made a dirty channel to assist in the conveyance of that corruption which is clogging up and destroying the very vitals of his country?	That Heaven may bless and preserve you is the prayer of, my dearest love,     Your ever fond, affectionate,                  and hereafter, faithful husband,                                                           W.
