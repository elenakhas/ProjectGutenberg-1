It was soon determined that the arrangement of the fibres themselves were directly responsible for the difficulty.	The oil commonly used is gasoline which is supplied to the cylinder through a so-called carburettor in which the vapors of gasoline are combined with ordinary air to make an explosive mixture.	A lump of coal, a glass of water, and a whiff of atmosphere contain all the nutritive elements, could we properly mix them, of a loaf of bread or a beefsteak.	THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE In the field of the agriculturist it is the same story.	While these mechanisms contained the germ of an idea of vast importance, the mechanisms themselves were of trivial utility.	Such a diminution as this will by no means ruin the Falls, yet it would seem as if it must sensibly affect them, particularly at some places near Goat Island, where the water flows at present in a very shallow stream.	Then came the perfecter, who hit upon a device that would correct this last defect,--and at last the mechanism, which hitherto had been only a curiosity, became a practical working machine.	That these go hurtling from one plate or pole of the battery to the other, along the wire, we can understand at least as a working theory; that, furthermore, the electrons have their origin either in the metal plates or in the liquid that connects them, seems equally obvious; but how shall we account for their development?	And this means is provided when two pieces of metal of different kinds, united with a metal conductor, are immersed in the liquid.	Be this as it may, he certainly set to work immediately after completing this journey, and never relaxed or ceased his efforts until a practical incandescent lamp had been produced.	To its influence, more than to any other single cause, must be ascribed the revolutionary change that came over the character of practical life in the nineteenth century.	The power for this factory is developed by an independent company, and is obtained by taking water from the river Pescara and leading it to a point above the generating station at Tramonti.	For some time the question of the durability of electric pumps was in dispute, but developments in quite recent years seem to prove that, in some instances at least, such pumps are practically indestructible.	TALLOW CANDLE AND PERFECTED OIL LAMP Stated in scientific terms, the problem of the ideal lamp-wick resolves itself into a question of how to supply oxygen to every portion of the flame in sufficient quantities to bring all the carbon particles to a temperature at which they are luminous.	In the early fifties, as already noted, Ericsson showed the feasibility of substituting hot air for steam, but although he constructed large engines, their power was so slight that he was obliged to give up the idea of competing with steam, and to use his engines for pumping where very small power was required.	Only fifteen feet have the waters sunk in their placid flowing since they left Lake Erie.	If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.	This charge of electricity may be positive or negative, or it may be neutral, by which is meant that the positive and negative charges may just balance.	His experiments were begun only about the year 1903, and the practical machinery for commercializing the results--in which enterprise Professor Birkeland has had the co-operation of a practical engineer, Mr. S. Eyde--is still in a sense in the experimental stage,--albeit a large factory was put in successful operation in 1905 at Notodden, Norway.	"The perfect balance of the moving parts and the extreme simplicity of construction tend to minimize the wear and increase the life of a turbine, and at the same time to reduce the chance of interruption in its operation through derangement of, or damage to, any of its essential parts.	Yet it seems mysterious, because so many substances are unaffected by it.	Early in the nineteenth century a lamp burning turpentine, under the name of "camphine," was invented that gave a good light and was smokeless; but like most others of its type, it was dangerous owing to its liability to explode.	The original account appeared, as stated, in the Marquis of Worcester's _Century of Inventions_, published in 1663.	Until now there has been no means known of extracting it cheaply from the clay of which it forms so important a constituent.	By 1810 the great Gas-Light and Coke Company was formed, and within the next five years gas street-lamps had become familiar objects in the streets of London, and house illumination by this means a common thing among the wealthier classes.	This supply of what is virtually fuel to be consumed, enabling the muscle to perform its work, is brought to the muscle through the streams of blood which flow from the heart in the arterial channels, and in part also through the lymphatic system.	No further explanation than this is necessary to show the enormous importance of this invention."	One of these disadvantages was that this safety lamp gave a poor light overhead.	If, however, two or more pulley wheels are connected, to make the familiar apparatus of a compound pulley, we have accomplished by an interesting mechanism a virtual application of the principle of the long and short arm of the lever, and the relations between the weight at the loose end of the rope and the weight attached to the block which constitutes virtually the short end of the lever, may be varied indefinitely, according to the number of pulley-wheels that are used.	The smaller figures show Dutch windmills of the present day, many of which are identical in structure with the windmills of the middle ages.	But perhaps the most ingenious feat of all which our primitive ancestor accomplished was in learning to utilize the muscular energy of other animals.	In due course, doubtless, other bodies of water, such as mountain lakes and mountain streams will be similarly put into electrical harness.	As you stand there beside this great steel mechanism a sense of wonderment and of utter helplessness takes possession of you.	The description is absolutely accurate; it is inclusive and exclusive.	He was, in point of fact, a carefully trained scientific experimenter, fully equipped with all the special knowledge of his time in its application to the particular branch of pneumatics to which he gave attention.	Thus electricity created its own greatest rival as an illuminant.	It is particularly interesting to note that in his first locomotive engine, Trevithick allowed the steam exhaust to escape into the funnel of the engine to increase the draught,--an expedient which was so largely responsible for Stephenson's success with his locomotive twenty years later, and which retains its utility in the case of the most highly developed modern locomotive.	Such portions of the current as reach the rapids have full license to pass on untrammeled, paying no toll to man.	What is this something?	When the rubbed amber acquires the property of drawing the pith ball to it, we naturally assume that some change has taken place in the condition of the amber; and since the visible particles of amber appear to be unchanged--since its color, weight, and friability are unmodified--it seems as if some immaterial quality must have been added to, or taken from it.	People fond of philosophical gymnastics may reflect with interest that, according to the newest theory, gravitation itself is, in the last analysis, an electrical phenomenon--a reflection which, it will be noted, leads the mind through a very curious cycle.	At the very least, however, it is able to give some interesting suggestions which seem to show that we are in a fair way to solve this world-old mystery.	It was this apparatus which was subsequently to make possible the utilization of electricity as a working force, but as yet no one suspected its possibilities in this direction.	Moreover, it is otherwise entitled to precedence, for even to-day, in this so-called age of steam and electricity, the muscular system remains by far the most important of all machines.	In any event, experience shows that such a current, under proper conditions, may be able to traverse a conducting wire for a long distance with relatively small loss.	Within recent years, however, various coal-cutting machines have been devised, with which the coal was actually cut, or sawed out, these machines being peculiarly well adapted to using the electric current.	But this constant outflow of waste products from the muscle necessitates, of course, in accordance with the laws of the conservation of matter and of energy, an equally constant supply of new matter to take the place of the old.	In this method dynamite and powder take the place of hand labor, the main mass of ore being dislodged and thrown into the shaft by blasting, instead of by hand labor.	The disc is provided with three holes, each fitted with a circular plate turning on an axis radial to the disc, and these plates when set at right angles to the disc become pistons in the lower enclosing chamber.	It must be understood, however, that the statical electricity will, if given opportunity, seek to escape from any given location to another location, under certain conditions, somewhat as water which is stored up in a reservoir will, when opportunity offers, flow down to a lower level.	Royalty payments      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax      returns.	Only about three per cent.	Davy made use of pieces of wood charcoal in his experiments, but these were too fragile to be of practical value, even if their other qualities had been ideal.	All this is simple enough if we regard only the _how_ and not the _why_ of the phenomena.	A modification of the toothed wheel is furnished by wheels which may be separated by a considerable distance, and the circumferences of which are connected by a belt or by a chain.	A silent and invisible electric current, generated by the fall of distant waters, does the work more expeditiously, more efficiently, and more cheaply than it could be done by any other method as yet discovered.

TURBINE ENGINES Whatever the future may hold, however, it remains true that the first practical solution of the problem of securing direct rotary motion from the action of steam, on a really commercial scale, was solved with an apparatus very different from any of those just described, the inventor being an Englishman, Mr. C. A. Parsons, and the apparatus the steam turbine, the first model of which he constructed in 1884, and which began to attract general attention in the course of the ensuing decade.	It is claimed for mantles made on this principle that they last much longer and retain their light-emitting power more uniformly than mantles made by the older process.	But this, on the whole, may have been rather advantageous than otherwise, as, being ignorant, he was perhaps in a more receptive state of mind than if hampered by false or prejudicial conceptions.	They traversed at best a few petty miles of its surface on foot or in carts; and they navigated the Mediterranean Sea, or at most coasted out a little way beyond the Pillars of Hercules in boats chiefly propelled by oars.	But an equally important problem is that of removing moisture from the ore itself.	It was only when man had reached a relatively high plane above the other members of the animal kingdom, therefore, that he would wish to prolong the daylight, and then the use of the torch made of some resinous wood would naturally suggest itself.	Thus at any given instant our solution of salt would contain numerous free _atoms_ of sodium and of chlorine, although we are justified in thinking of this substance as a whole as composed of sodium-chlorine _molecules_.	A scholarly discussion of the subject of Roman mills, based on a comprehensive study of the references in classical literature, is given in Beckmann's _History of Inventions_, London, 1846.	In blasting, a deep hole is first drilled into the ore near the top of the embankment, and into this hole a stick of dynamite is dropped and exploded.	It might then be conveyed to any part of the world, and, its poles being connected, the charge of electricity would be made available.	The experiments thus inaugurated were followed up in America by Joseph Henry of Albany who made enormous electromagnets, capable of sustaining great weights.	This estimate may be only a guess, but it matters not whether it be high or low; all estimates are futile, all comparisons inadequate to convey even a vague conception of the majesty of power with which the mighty waters rush on to their final plunge into the abysm.	As the ore is removed and the earth thus honeycombed in all directions, supports of various kinds must be made to prevent caving.	When he strives to work with his hands, his effort is but a pitiful one; he can by no possibility compete (as regards mere quantity of labor) with the ox and the horse.	The most practical and popular form of machine is one in which the sawing is done by an endless chain, the links of which are provided with a cutting blade.	So that for the moment no practical results came from this demonstration, conclusive though it was, and the introduction of a commercial electric light was of necessity deferred until a cheaper method of generating electricity should be discovered.	As long ago as the year 1807 Sir G. Cayley in England produced a motor of this type, in which the heated air passed directly from the furnace to the cylinder, where it did work while expanding until its pressure was not greater than that of the atmosphere, when it was discharged.	A modern steam-engine makes available only five to ten per cent.	By 1810 the great Gas-Light and Coke Company was formed, and within the next five years gas street-lamps had become familiar objects in the streets of London, and house illumination by this means a common thing among the wealthier classes.	This reaction of aluminum and iron does not, to be sure, give a higher temperature than the electric arc; but this culminating feat has been achieved, in laboratory experiments, through the explosion of cordite in closed steel chambers; the experimenters being the Englishmen Sir Andrew Noble and Sir F. Abel.	It will be seen that the sails can be furled when desired to put the mill out of operation.	By means of this invention electricity, instead of being the most costly means of illumination becomes the cheapest--cheaper even than kerosene.	Meanwhile the fire gained rapidly, threatening the building and its eight hundred inmates, and was only checked after holes had been made through fire-proof floors and ceilings for admitting the nozzle.	The water of Niagara River is of course no different from any other body of water of equal size.	Each of the top-like dynamos generates 5000 horse-power.]
