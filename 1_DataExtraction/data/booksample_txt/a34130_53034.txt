They shrank back, fearful that the display might be a disapproving communication--yet they held their ground, knowing they had lived good lives and deserved no condemnation on any score they could imagine.	The only significant difference was that the God gleamed mysteriously, as if its angular, hard-line representation of normal form were cast in shining stone.	*       *       *       *       * Two days later, a second God was detected.	"How wonderful it would be to fly," said Yrl.	It braced two sets of tentacles against the ground, as if trying to push itself erect.	How wonderful it would be also if the God could tell them how to get rid of the itching, crawling, parasitic _plllnk_, whose bite, in sufficient numbers, was often fatal!...	It was one-fifth the size of the God's body.	A _very_ long time passed.	Strange marks were on the side of the God's body.	*       *       *       *       * The last few moments of the God's descent were quite rapid.	The God, unable to remain erect with its injury, slowly toppled.	The God had assumed conversation-position.	A long time passed.	Grg and Yrl moved into view, from the shadows of the crater wall.	From a selfish standpoint, it might even tell them how to get rid of the _plllnk_--a subject of constant prayer.	It silently circled Phobos from the Universal Eye.	How smoothly it flew!	The _plllnk_ changed course and headed swiftly up a sand dune.	The two double-tentacles remained outstretched, however--and they pointed at the shadows where Grg and Yrl waited and watched.	It must have healed its broken tentacle--truly a God!	Would it divulge the Cosmic Secret?	Grg and Yrl stared at each other.	The God began to land.	Their thinking trunks tingled with misery, sorrow, bitter anger and disappointment.	It silently circled Phobos, and then returned to the Eye.	Within the day, it was back, in the company of eleven other Gods.	With a great bound, impelled by outrage, Yrl was upon it.	What would the God tell them?	It bore considerable resemblance to a _plllnk_, except for its shiny-wrinkled grey skin (_plllnks_ were purple.)	The God lowered, on its belching tongue of flame--the flame that seemed a tiny part, a sliver, of the Universal Eye that Watched.	From that great Eye, a day ago, had sprung a shining Messenger, an Emissary, a God that must be coming on a purposeful visit.	Simultaneously, the darting red flames seemed to lessen in intensity and length.	Soon it would be as good as new; for otherwise, agony would forbid conversation.	Dead?	Dying?	As it flew it reflected starlight--and the red glow of the Universal Eye behind it--from its sleek surfaces.	It was silent.	Again it was motionless.	While Grg touched tentacles with the dead God, in reverent mourning, in terrible sorrow, in loss, in supplication, Yrl shredded the god-_plllnk_.	This was the greatest moment of Grg's and Yrl's lives.	The huge _plllnk_, even now creeping around--wrinkle-skinned and detestable, its coloration the same as the God's; the most loathsome sight imaginable ... a god-_plllnk_!	_That was a neat bit of sloppiness, that landing.... Carruthers will chew me out and in again!_ Pause: _Holy cats, I hope the radio isn't busted, or I'll have a helluva wait before they follow up and find me!..._)        *       *       *       *       * The God was dead.	Yrl moved to intercept it.	Grg and Yrl gasped as one of the God's double-tentacles buckled, crumpled, with a glinting of shiny-hard material.	It was octopidal, with sinewy double tentacles, and a thinking trunk, and a reproduction pouch!	Would it tell them the place and destiny of their lowly race?	Had it come to punish them for not being good enough, for over-reproducing, for worshipping improperly?	Caught by horror, and fearing the worst, Grg and Yrl waited for the God to speak.	The God stirred.	Grg and Yrl blinked their own dull-surfaced, astronomically far-sighted, rust-red eyes at each other in supreme excitement and anticipation.	Something appeared at the hole.	It did not land.	Now.	It paused, then dropped to the surface of Phobos, where it began to crawl about.	While Grg and Yrl and their people could bound about with a great agility in Phobos' light gravity, they could not _fly_.	(For a broken tentacle meant that fluids would seep out, and soon the dry-death would occur.)	2.	And this thing was huge--_Huge_.	They waited for the God to speak.	The flames stopped.	"Perhaps," said Grg, "we have been found ready to be taught!"	It grew larger--larger--and then it stopped growing larger.	Red flickers and sharp-edged black shadows danced about the two who waited below.	Killed by the giant _plllnk_--a scourge from which, evidently, even the Gods were not spared.	It was motionless.	What would it reveal?	He combed the light fur there, found the _plllnk_, and shredded it, casting the pieces round-about so that no two of them might combine to form another _plllnk_.	It had been detected at the half-way point of its trip.	Then Grg twitched as a _plllnk_ bit him, just under the front left double-tentacle.	The _plllnk_ stopped, having sensed them.	They were: 1st MARS EXPEDITION--U. S. SPACE FORCE--PLANET-TO-SATELLITE CREWBOAT NO.	Its body thudded silently, stirring pumice dust.	(_Damn_, John Cotter was thinking.	The effort was not successful.	But there could be no doubt regarding its origin, its nature, its destination-- For, in the matter of form, the God was a close replica of Grg and Yrl--of all the creatures of their race!	Mars was, as Grg and Yrl had learned from their Elders and now taught their Youngers, the stern Seeing-All Eye of It Who Was the Universe.	It shot red flame downward from its mouth, on the underside of its gleaming body.	Then, at the second of impact, they brightened again to previous power--but too late.	The impact was hard.	Then a tiny hole appeared in the God's side.	It was ready to address them.	Was the God fatally injured?	Grg and Yrl sighed in relief.
