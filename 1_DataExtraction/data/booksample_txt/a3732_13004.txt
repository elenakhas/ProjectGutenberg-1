It is better to be slighted   Than to stay when not invited,     For they _never_ ask a Goop to come again!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Poor Mother!]	It gave me _such_ a start!	So Jane had to go and explain to her friends,   And that is how many a Goop party ends!	"_You made me late to school_!"	Which of them was Goop, and which was not?	"Won't you carry me?	Goop!
