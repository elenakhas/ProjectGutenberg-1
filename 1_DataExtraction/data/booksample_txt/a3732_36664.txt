Do you go the shortest way,   Never stopping once to play?	Willy, he owned up to it,     And didn't tell a lie!	The children point and stare.	[Illustration] [Illustration: Borrowing] _BORROWING_   Whose doll is that on the table?	_She_ said "I have no doubt!"	[Illustration] [Illustration: George Adolphus] _GEORGE ADOLPHUS_   Oh, think what George Adolphus did!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Disfiguration] _DISFIGURATION_       Have you ever seen the scrawls       On the fences and the walls,   All the horrid little pictures and the horrid little names?	[Illustration] [Illustration: Courtesy] _COURTESY_   I wonder why it is polite   In shaking hands, to give your _right_.	Perhaps the reason is because   The Goops, they never have such laws!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Clothes] _CLOTHES_   When you are playing in the dirt,   You should wear clothes you cannot hurt;   It will not matter, when they're worn,   If they are just a _little_ torn.	[Illustration] [Illustration: Bravery] _BRAVERY_       It's terrible brave       To try to save   A girl on a runaway horse;   You could do that, of course!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Memory] _MEMORY_   My teacher taught me, yesterday,   A very pretty piece to say;   But when I try to think of it,   I can't remember it a bit!	I _hope_ they'll not neglect you!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Politeness] _POLITENESS_   I think it would be lots of fun   To be polite to every one;   A boy would doff his little hat,   A girl would curtsey, just like that!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Curiosity] _CURIOSITY_   I think that it would help you much   If you'd remember _not to touch_.	[Illustration] [Illustration: "Why?"]	But if _you_ were dirty, you'd wash, wouldn't you?	[Illustration] [Illustration: Honesty] _HONESTY_   The boy who plays at marbles and doesn't try to cheat,   Who always keeps his temper, no matter if he's beat,   Is sure to be a favorite with all upon the street.	[Illustration] [Illustration: Caution] _CAUTION_   When you travel in the street,   Are you cautious and discreet?	So study your best   Till it's time for a rest,     The clock will go fast, if you let it!	When father said to go to bed,   Then "_Why?_" was all Josephus said.	He went where mother had forbid,     And said he "_didn't care!_"   Oh, think what George Adolphus did!	Don't you think it is a shame?	When you pay a visit, never grumble or complain,   Try to be so affable they'll want you there again;   Don't forget the older ones, your hostess least of all,   When you're leaving tell her you have had a pleasant call!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Teasing] _TEASING_   Tease to linger longer when your mother bids you go;   Tease to have a penny when your father answers, "No!"	The Goops are all dirty, and what do they do?	[Illustration] [Illustration: Order] _ORDER_   Make your soldiers march away,   When you're finished with your play.	He made his mother cry!	But sometimes mother's head will ache   With all the jolly noise you make,   And sometimes other people, too,   Can't spend the time to play with you!	If you needed a bath, you would say so!	Can you blame your mother     If she looks severe.	[Illustration] [Illustration: Tidiness] _TIDINESS_   Little scraps of paper,     Little crumbs of food,   Make a room untidy,     Everywhere they're strewed.	When little brother stubs his toe,     Do you look on and laugh?	Are the Goops the ones to blame?	Do you look about for horses   When your little brother crosses?	[Illustration] [Illustration: Miss Manners] _MISS MANNERS_   No matter how you wish   For the last one on the dish,   Miss Manners has a right to it, not you;   And the largest one of all,   Or the nicest, big or small--   Well, I think you'd better leave her _that_ one too!	When bed-time comes, it's time for you   To stop, for when you're yawning,   You should be dreaming what you'll do   When it's to-morrow morning.	Tease to have a story when your uncle doesn't please;   That's the way to be a Goop--_tease, tease, tease!_   Hint about the carriage when there's only room for three;   Hint about the toys you like and every doll you see;   Hint about the candy, say you're fond of peppermint;   That's the way to be a Goop--_hint, hint, hint!_ [Illustration] [Illustration: Interruption] _INTERRUPTION_   Don't interrupt your father when he's telling funny jokes;   Don't interrupt your mother when she's entertaining folks;   Don't interrupt the visitors when they have come to call,--   In fact, it's generally wiser not to interrupt at all.	[Illustration] [Illustration: Cry-Baby] _CRY-BABY_   I'm sure that I would rather die   Than have my playmates see me cry;       It twists your face       And knots your forehead,   And makes you look all cross and horrid;   And every one who sees you cries   "What _is_ the matter with your eyes?"	Did his mother punish him?	[Illustration] [Illustration: Pets] _PETS_   Almost every Goop forgets   When it's time to feed his pets,     'Cause his memory fails;     Listen to his wails!	for your father is reading.	'Twas never anything but "WHY?"	Fie!	But somehow I imagine you are better,   And you _try_ to go, and _cry_ to go, in fact!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Fortitude] _FORTITUDE_   When you have been a naughty child,     Or taken more than was your share,   When you've been sulky, cross or wild,     You must not say, "Oh, I don't care!"	No!	But when you hate to see it rain,     And when it's time to comb your hair,   And when you have a little pain,     _Then_ you can say, "Oh, I don't care!"	My teacher told me yesterday   "_Work when you work; Play when you play!_"   When I am playing with my toys   I am the busiest of boys;   But when I study or I work   I'm 'fraid I _am_ inclined to shirk!	When mother bade him stop his play,   Then "_Why?_" Josephus used to say.	I wonder why it is well-bred,   If you must sneeze, to turn your head.	[Illustration] [Illustration: Books] _BOOKS_   I have a notion     The Books on the shelves   Are just as much persons     As we are, ourselves.	[Illustration] [Illustration: Gentleness] _GENTLENESS_   When you are playing with the girls,   You must not pull their pretty curls;   If you are gentle when you play,   You will be glad of it some day.	Hush!	My head's so full of toys and such,   I can't remember very much!	The girl who counts her hundreds very fairly, when she's "it"   Who doesn't peep or listen, nor turn around a bit,   I'm sure she's not a Goop, in fact, she's quite the opposite!	for your mother is ill.     Hush!	Willy spilled the ink,   Willy left the water-pipe     Running in the sink!	He always made the same reply.	Do you sharpen pencils,     Ever, on the floor?	Did you ever catch them playing at their horrid little games?	If _you_ lent your playthings, I think you would say things     If no one returned them to you!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Consideration] _CONSIDERATION_   When you're old, and get to be   Thirty-four or forty-three,   Don't you hope that you will see     Children all respect you?	When she says, "It looks to me   As if the Goops were here"?	When you are older,     You'll find this is true;   You'd better be careful     To make Books like you!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Tardiness] _TARDINESS_   Goodness gracious sakes alive!	Mother said, "Come home at five!"	The greediest Goop would give away     The things he didn't need--   To share the toys with which you play,     That's generous, indeed!	I wonder why it is refined   In passing one, to go _behind_.	They open bottles of cologne,   And feel of parcels not their own!	Will they, without being told,   Wait on you, when you are old,   Or be heedless, selfish, cold?	But think of trying       To keep from crying,   When you're hungry and tired and cross--   You couldn't do _that_, of course!	The children whoop "You are a Goop!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Willy] _WILLY_   Willy broke the window-pane.	The Goops do this, and they do more,   They peep and listen at the door!	All your playthings and your toys   Must be trained like girls and boys!	But when you're really nicely dressed,   Be careful of your Sunday Best!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Bed-Time] _BED-TIME_   The night is different from the day--   It's darker in the night;   How can you ever hope to play   When it's no longer light?	for the baby     Is sleeping, and may be   He'll catch a nice dream if you're still.	[Illustration] [Illustration: Neatness] _NEATNESS_   Goops leave traces everywhere--   Gum stuck underneath the chair,   Muddy footprints in the hall,   Show that Goops have been to call;   Shoes and stockings on the floor   Show where Goops have been before!	[Illustration] [Illustration: Helpfulness] _HELPFULNESS_   I never knew a Goop to help his mother,   I never knew a Goop to help his dad,   And they never do a thing for one another;   They are actually, absolutely bad!	And both would use such words as these:   "_Excuse me, Sir_," and "_If you please_;"   Not only just at home, you know,   But everywhere that they should go.	But there are many stupid folks   Who do not care for children's jokes.
