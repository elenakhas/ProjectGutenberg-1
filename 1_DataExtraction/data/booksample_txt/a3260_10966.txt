I had fully expected him to get on to the other fellows' tracks like a ton of bricks.	Abruptly, as I walked backwards and forwards, taking occasional glances over the sea (which was almost calm), my eye caught the glow of a light out in the darkness.	Then a quick flash spat out across the shadows, followed immediately by a sharp, ringing crack.	From him, my gaze jumped to the lee rigging.	"The Lord knows!"	he asked.	"Up with you, lads," the Second Mate said.	I found him crouched on a sea-chest, his knees up to his chin, and his gaze fixed on the doorway, with a frightened stare.	"There you are," I said with a jerk of my head.	Do you think I'm blind?"	"Well," he said.	From the rigging to leeward there came suddenly a buzz of men talking.	"I wonder who'd feel like having a sleep after what I've seen and stood today!"	The wind had died away to a light breeze, and I was working at the main rigging, along with Plummer, putting on seizings.	"Are you a lunatic?	I got a little touch of despair, and asked myself what was going to be the end of all these beastly happenings.	A minute later, I heard him coming along the deck.	There was no sign of the man with the flare on the starboard craneline.	"Take a couple of the 'prentices down with you, and pass out a box of blue-lights and some flare-ups."	As we went, the Second Mate's voice came to us through the darkness.	"I suppose it does come to that," I answered.	What's more, he didn't seem ter be talkin' down to us on deck-- what I could make hout.	answered Tom.	A sudden idea seemed to occur to the Skipper, and he turned, and went through the doorway into the Saloon.	Then, suddenly, crouching under the rail near the log-reel, I saw something that looked like a man; but so hazy and unreal, that I could scarcely say I saw anything.	He opened his mouth.	I got up off the hatch, where I was kneeling.	said Jock, tersely, and climbed over the top, and so disappeared from my sight.	"It's possible," I replied.	"Nothing.	"What was _what?_" I said.	"That's the spectacle that's hitting the yard."	"Jump on the house, Tammy," I said.	"'ow were that?"	It is curious how all this flashed through my mind, and held my attention--although only momentarily--in the face of the Skipper's storming.	Down on deck, the rest of the men were busy clearing up the ropes.	I got up from the chest, and went to the door, the other three following.	Then I turned to Williams, hurriedly.	"No!"	"Certainly," I replied.	"Garn!"	I let go from the rigging with my right hand, and struck furiously at his leg, cursing him for his clumsiness.	he called, and grabbed at the stay, and waved his flare, excitedly.	"Well, don't you know what was the matter?"	It had been broadside on to the sun.	The Second Mate grunted some of the huskiness out of his throat, and spoke.	Tom jumped out of his bunk, and began to dress, quickly.	the Second replied.	I saw that it was a revolver, and he held another in his other hand, and this I saw him put into his side pocket.	"If you want to say anything, say it across the wheel-box.	Plummer!"	"S--sh!"	"Yes, Sir," answered Tammy, and took the light.	I've a very good mind to."	"Doesn't look to _me_, Stubbins," I said, "as though the Second did believe we've seen the light."	I can't see very plainly yet."	"And you know it.	Williams jumped away from the rail, and ran aft a few steps.	I asked.	Away aft, hanging from the gaff-end, was a string of flags.	Among us there came a moment of dead silence, and I noticed the wail and moan of the wind aloft, and the flap, flap of the three unfurled t'gallan's'ls.	I heard the Mate shout.	"You've never seen them, except after nightfall?"	he said; and then: "Yes, go on!"	"What!"	"Very well," he said.	Then, with the aid of the Second Mate and one of the hands, he brought out the three dead chaps on to the after hatch, and there sewed them up, with a few lumps of holy stone at their feet.	"You saw for yourself!"	With the realisation that I had let the ship get almost aback, there came a sudden memory of the alteration in the position of the other vessel.	Then he blew his whistle, and one of the men ran aft, out of the fo'cas'le, to see what it was he wanted.	"'ow did yer get 'old er ther gasket, when yer fell, then?"	he sung out.	he inquired.	"No," I said, answering Tom's question, "you've had--" "Shut that, Jessop!"	"You still hold, then, that you saw a ship the other morning, when I sent you from the wheel?"	replied the Skipper, pointing.	I said.	inquired Plummer, getting out of his bunk, sleepily.	Away aft, we heard the sound of steps, along the deck.	"We might be run down, then," he said, "and never even see the other vessel?"	Help!	He looked round at the men appealingly.	I shouted, helplessly.
