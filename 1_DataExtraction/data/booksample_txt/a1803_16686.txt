Maggie loves every creature that lives; she won't confess to black              beetles, but she can't stamp on them (I've stamped out lots              in my winter boots), and she doesn't even think a donkey              ugly when he brays;     And she says she shall buy a brush, out of her pocket-money, and brush              my donkey every day till he looks like a horse, and that it              shan't be her fault if there isn't one poor old brute beast              who lives happily to the end of his days.

I saw the pictures of it in a book I was looking in, to see where              perhaps I should like to emigrate.	Perhaps, if I try hard at Convalescence now, I may become a brave              sea-captain hereafter, and take my beautiful ship into battle,              and bring her out again with flying colours and fame,     If the courage that dares, and the courage that bears, _are_ really              one and the same.	The Hedgehog he spoke never a word,             And he never stirred;     His peeping eyes, his inquisitive nose,             And his tender toes,     Were all wrapped up in his prickly clothes.	We are so fond of flowers, Jack and I often dream at night     Of getting up and finding our garden ablaze with all colours, blue,              red, yellow, and white.

CONFIRMATION.	DANDELION.	Long, long ago, with vows too much forgotten,       The Cross of Christ was seal'd on every brow,     Ah!	I only remember its use as a     check on the indiscriminate 'collecting' and 'grubbing' of a     large family; a mystic warning not without force to fetter the     same fingers in later life, with all the power of a pious              tradition."--J.H.E.
