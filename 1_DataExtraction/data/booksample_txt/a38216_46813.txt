About this time we lost our brother Vainka.	Crane me no cranes: it is goose or nothing; give me the gun, Ivan!	Since my little adventure with the pack of wolves I have never felt the slightest vestige of respect for their class.	He could hardly expect the moujiks themselves to attend on ordinary Sundays!	What matter if we catch anything or nothing?	Spask did not even boast of an _ochotnik_, or hunter, among its inhabitants; the population, one and all, were as ignorant of the best course to pursue under the circumstances as though the foul fiend himself had suddenly appeared among them, and their tongues, as well as their arms, were absolutely paralysed with amazement and terror.	An hour afterwards, as the Souls of Spask were engaged, _more suo_, in wrangling over their midday _vodka_, at the beer-house, to them entered the pale and dishevelled figure of the discredited wise-woman.	The fact is, that early in the winter Kushlefka had been so unfortunate as to lose the services of its _pastuch_, or cowherd, death having carried off the old man during the slack time--when the cows were all at home, that is, and needed no one to look after them.	I came upon the party accidentally.	Meanwhile the bear, seeing that none seemed anxious to dispute his presence, turned his attention to the red bundles which contained the food whose good smell had probably attracted him, visiting several of these in turn and rolling them about in his attempts to get at their contents.	The skipper and the engineer were both aboard, grinning with delight from behind the cover.	The starost, feeling unable to decide the question single-handed, resolved to convoke a special meeting of the Souls of the Village in order to give full consideration to the proposal of the wise woman.	The Finns have been           Protestants since about 1530.	Flat and dull, with here a belt of pine forest, and there a tumble-down village--all Russian villages present a tumble-down appearance--and stubble and potatoes and waste land: there is not much to look at, and no towns of any size and importance are passed.	There were no gipsies to carry them away, or brigands--they had never heard of such gentry; it was perfectly safe, and nobody bothered his head about the babies.

They employ their good looks unfortunately to the ruin of our race, too frequently luring young men to their doom, by enticing them into the deep waters and there either tickling them to death or else drowning them; for the _rusalki_ are of a mischievous and frivolous nature and have very little good feeling about them.	Now comes the fun.	CHAPTER V AFTER DUCKS ON LADOGA Once upon a time when Autumn was holding sway, and Winter was within hail, a Russian friend, knowing my weakness for making acquaintance with every kind of creature to be seen in the Land of the Tsars, very kindly proposed to me to journey with him up the Neva to Schluesselburg, or near it, where he owned a large house and much land; and there to embark in his steam-launch for a duck-shooting cruise on Lake Ladoga.	As it was, from the top of a tree I saw the furious beasts fall upon poor Masha, tear her to pieces, and eat her entirely up, so that not a trace remained, while an invisible _lieshui_ spirit laughed aloud until every particle was consumed.	There was no mistake about it, it was indeed a bear, and a big one, too--"the tsar of the bears," as a moujik expressed it afterwards.	Quick, or he will be off and away!"	After all it takes some little while for the very idea of such an unexampled insult as this to take root in the patrician mind: _me_ to be pursued and pulled down by wolves!	The noise appeared to proceed from among the pine boughs over my head, and I now peered about with redoubled diligence in the direction whence it came.	Therefore the deputation proceeded straight to the village drinking-shop and there drank the priest's health times enough to secure _his_ immunity from cholera anyhow, unless the fates persistently disregarded the vows of the pious intoxicated.	You can, if you please, sit up in bed and point with the hand and say: "There is the window, and there the door, and there the wardrobe," and so on.	Then the starost paid a long visit to Yegor, the _ochotnik_ (sportsman) of the village, and made certain arrangements.	Then we took boat, at about eight o'clock, and rowed across to a spot where a trap awaited us--and such a trap!--and drove away through the drooping day towards the Count's wonderful water.	We had agreed to put back the babies, the very tiniest, that is; though we invariably took a great number home with us which we did not intend to eat, in order to let them go at the bottom of the garden as stock for our own portion of the river, and to afford us sport when they should have grown to more respectable dimensions.	The wolves--who were not within a hundred miles--got all the credit, or abuse, for my depredations.	Let us go home, Ivan, we shall see no more of bird-life this morning; take up your poor grey victim and come along--the place will be the better and the happier for our departure, and perhaps, after a while, all its evicted tenants, save one, may return again to their own.	"Why, there, just in front of your nose!"	Probably they could have rid themselves of the bait and us at any moment if they had been so disposed, but they were too good-natured.	For six long years and as many months it had wandered, entreating for baptism and finding none that could hear its voice; now there remained but a few months wherein to gain the blessed privilege, and hope had grown faint and weak.	The poor brute could not land; his efforts to gain a foothold waxed feeble; his roars of pain and rage grew weaker, thinned themselves into pitiful whines and bubbling moans, and then died away altogether.	It was after our first winter alone--without mother and the rest, I mean.	The _vodyánnuie_, who have in all probability shown their displeasure for some time before the sacrifice by causing the river to overflow its banks, or the ice to carry away the bridge, having now received their rights as by custom established, at once settle down in peace and quietness for a whole year.	is the word; then, "Easy ahead;" and slowly and cautiously we glide forward towards our hitherto unsuspecting quarry.	Thence to Imatra is not far, and from Imatra to Varpa-Saari is a short drive of three miles or so, past the renowned "falls," about which I shall have more to say later.	These same _vodyannuie_ are a tricky race of beings and require much propitiation at the hands of millers, fishermen, and others who have dealings with them or with the waters within their jurisdiction.	I inquired, as I went to meet him.	Around the island platforms have been built jutting out into the turbulent water for the convenience of those who wish to try for the favours of grayling or trout with fly, in preference to spinning for them with a minnow from a boat.	"Are you sure it was not a _bielaya kooropatka_ (willow grouse)?"	he asked.	The _telyegi_, I may explain, are springless carts upon four wheels.	What a slow flight it seems, yet it carries him wonderfully far away from us in a short time!	As the old woman was busily employed washing her children's clothes in the river, on chancing to raise her head she espied for the first time since the memorable evening of her first abortive cursing, the very identical object of that curse and of very many others since lavished upon him in the secret recesses of her being--Bruin himself.	I'm sure it isn't up to July oats or honey, or even baby--which is delicious when one happens to be of a carnivorous turn of mind, as one is sometimes.	your cake is eaten!	Then they both disappeared behind a hedge, and for a moment the yelping was redoubled, and then ceased altogether.	The very idea of any salmon mounting in safety such a whirling, battling, irresistible fury of waters as Imatra is surely outrageous.	But to continue: when spring came and we sallied forth from our winter quarters, we were both so hungry that positively we could almost have eaten one another.	"At Drevnik, your mercifulness," replied the seller.	It is certain that the belief is very general that numbers of _rodityelui_, _i.e._, the spirits of the fathers of the family, still reside in and watch over the establishments of their posterity not yet quit of the infirmities of the flesh.	Radion had none of the chivalry of the sportsman, and thought nothing of taking the "matka," or mother-bird, from her helpless fledglings, leaving them to starvation, or to the foxes and the grey-hooded crows.	I declare to you that I would rather go back to the humans than earn my living in the woods; I came away because I pined for the winter sleep for which my nature yearns--I should have had to work, with them; _now_, I have had my rest and am as fresh as a daisy!"	My earliest recollections are of life in a dark and confined space in which my two brothers and my two sisters and I had but little room for our juvenile recreations.	Slowly the two boats approach--it seems a sin to murder the marvel of the stillness by speaking--like two swans they swim towards us in the white twilight.	Meanwhile, what was the child to him, body or soul, in comparison with his beloved Doonya?	And so, sped upon our way by the shouts of our admiring friends the little Finnish maids and urchins, we set forth once more to brave the perils and discomforts of the return journey.	I shall scarcely be believed, perhaps, but it is a positive fact, that I have seen three of them sitting in the snow around a dying man who was unarmed and perfectly helpless, waiting until he should have breathed his last breath before they dared pounce upon him.	It may be, but if so it is a tiny one.	"At Drevnik, your mercifulness," replied the seller.	Red-shirted peasants were busy at work in the fields, together with gaily-clad women and a few children.	poor _znaharka_!--Tatiana's own dog; he grew bolder day by day, and at last his daring culminated in the pursuit and capture of a poor little child.	Ivan came blundering into our house, groping about with his hands, for it was too dark to see anything.	"It is Vasilice," he said.	Roaring and hissing with rage, they pile themselves mountain high in an instant, and sweep down the moderate incline in a furious phalanx of angry wave-warriors, dashing from one rocky side of the gorge to the other, diving, rearing, whirling, plunging, hurling angry hisses of spray to this side and that, and at the foot of the narrow torture-chamber standing up in mighty water-columns and twisting round to face the rock-walls that have confined them, as though they half thought of turning again and rending them ere they depart once more upon their course in unimpeded freedom and gradually regained calm and majesty.	I knew that I must kill this man, and that he could not escape me or injure me.	The stock-in-trade of the complete crawfisher, a strong hand-net and a pound or two of slightly high meat, was in readiness for each of us; our pike rods and tackle were seen to; the most particular instructions were issued as to our awakening as soon as daylight should appear; the vehicles, or rather their peasant owners, were hunted up for the hundredth and last time and warned, with all solemnity, as to the awful consequences that unpunctuality would bring down upon their heads, and then we all four went to bed and wished for day.	Happy Bishop Henry, friend of Eric IX.	This offers an excellent opportunity to get rid of the _vyedma_ altogether.	And in an hour we are there, floating on Voksa's white bosom, propelled softly hither and thither as our boatmen think best; for these men know where the huge silver Voksa and Saima trout most do congregate, and the charm and wonder of the river and of the night are nothing to them so long as some big ten or fifteen pounder can be induced to accept the invitation our cruel blue minnows hold out to them.	He will eat no more oats!"	As for the _domovoy_, or house-spirit, it seems uncertain whether this strongly marked individuality is the embodiment, in one person, of the entire company of the _rodítyelui_, or a separate and distinct personality.	There was always water in this spot in the driest season.	You can't do that, you know.	"What!	She made a good fight of it--ha ha!	Then he disappeared among the dark pines, moaning and grunting so as to be heard for a considerable distance.	Then he visited a bundle which contained a baby.	From St. Petersburg to Schlüsselburg, up the Neva, is a trip of some six or seven hours by the deliberate steamer in which the journey is made; it is, after all, the whole length of the Neva, from source to sea.	I had not enjoyed much climbing of late, so that I anticipated some little trouble and exertion in reaching the required altitude; therefore I pushed along until I saw a tree which looked easy to climb; then I ran to its foot, stopped, and turned round.
