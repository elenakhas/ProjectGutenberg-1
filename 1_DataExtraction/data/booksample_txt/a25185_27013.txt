In a line stood the men who were to fling themselves into the light to be warped into another dimension, there to seek out and fight an unknown enemy.	The head of the creature twisted, bent backward, and the body toppled back in a leisurely manner.	Perhaps through some sense which he, as a being of another plane, held, but which was alien to the Earth.	Come and I will show you."	Elaborate electrical barriers have failed.	Ouglat, one of the ancients, and Mal Shaff, reincarnated.	From somewhere new force and life were flowing into his body.	That may account for it.	You said a short time ago that only a specified dimension could exist on one single plane."	Close on his heels followed the little cockney.	questioned the old man.	He lay still and stared out into the less dark moor that stretched before him.	Like a flash Mal Shaff darted into the blackness, was completely swallowed in it.	"Time up!"	They thought I was an old fool--I, the man who alone stands between them and utter destruction."	Mal Shaff's head now was on a level with the other's chest; his huge arms seemed toylike in comparison with those of Ouglat, his legs mere pipestems.	Mal Shaff felt sure.	You bloated...." His words trailed off into a stream of vileness that could never have occurred to a third-dimensional mind.	Won't he talk at all?	Typewriters gibbered like chuckling morons through the roaring tumult of the editorial rooms.	He remembered it dimly as being of great importance.	It is apparent that while the Horror has lost one material dimension, it has retained certain fourth-dimensional properties which make it invulnerable to the forces at the command of our plane."	But the terrible sounds that came from between his slobbering lips were not those of his own voice, they were the voices of many men.	"Have you absolutely no imagination?"	The machine thundered steadily with a suggestion of horrible power.	The tall man stepped forward.	It was the other men, the men who were flinging themselves into the column of light in the laboratory to be warped back to this plane, to be incorporated in his body.	"But," pointed out Henry Woods, "you say they are fourth-dimensional things.	The blue light, hissing, drove from disk to disk; the room thundered with the roar of the machine, before which stood Dr. White, his hand on the lever, his eyes glued on the instruments before him.	He could have sworn he had seen it somewhere before.	Hanging from the ceiling, directly above the one on the floor, was another concave disk, but this one had a far more pronounced curvature.	It was alive, for it had moved.	Some take the form of animals, others of birds and reptiles, and some are cast in appalling shapes such as might be snatched out of the horrid imagery of a thing which resided in a world entirely alien to our own."	he demanded.	Like an automaton he placed one foot on the disk.	From the fourth dimension to the third, from the third to the second, from the second to the first, from the first to a questionable existence or plane which is beyond our understanding or perhaps to oblivion and the end of life.	If you can't tell me what you want us to publish, I will say good-day."	His fingers closed upon it and he drew the weapon.	The principle of the machine is--" The old man was about to launch into a lengthy discussion, but Henry interrupted him.	"Have you ever thought that our evolutionists might be wrong, that evolution might be downward instead of upward?	But all it did was to produce a slight sting.	"There must be a difference in time in the fourth dimension.	"Richards," he said, "write a streamer, 'Help Needed,' 'Reinforcements Called'--something of that sort, you know.	"You propose to warp a third-dimensional being into a fourth dimension.	There is a chasm of knowledge between us so wide and so deep that it staggers the imagination.	From the hinterlands came tales of murder done at midnight, of men and women horribly mangled, of livestock slaughtered, of buildings crushed as if by some titanic force.	If you ask me, sir, they are a tough lot."	"I am not sending a third-dimensional thing to a fourth dimension.	I am changing the third-dimensional being into a fourth-dimensional being.	"Yes.	He could no longer continue this unequal fight.	Here, in this one body were the bodies, the brains, the power, the spirit, of those other ninety-eight men.	Our case is probably paralleled by thousands of other intelligences on far-flung planets and island universes.	He turned again to the reporters who stood about the desk.	asked the old man, unbelievingly.	Well, tell him that he'll have them.	So far as you were concerned it would have no mass.	"Vaguely, yes."	His punches should be weaker.	"Do you know anything about evolution?"	asked the newspaperman.	"Composing room," he shouted, "get ready for a new front!	Although still     apparently immune to the weapons being used against it, it is     lifting the siege of this city.	What can be done about it?"	"Operator," he said, "get me the Secretary of War at Washington.	But he staggered to his feet to meet the charge of the ancient enemy and a grim song, a death chant immeasurably old, suddenly and dimly remembered from out of the mists of countless millenniums, was on his lips as he swung a pile-driver blow into the suddenly astonished face of the rushing Ouglat....        *       *       *       *       * The milky globe atop the machine in Dr. White's laboratory glowed softly, and within that glow two figures seemed to struggle.	In desperation Ouglat put every ounce of his strength into a heave that broke the other's grip and flung him away.	For God's sake, do something!"	It looked familiar.	A reverse process is used to return the object to the third.	"You can always jerk them back, sir," suggested George.	"I know that some of the scientists believe they came from some other planet, perhaps even from some other solar system.	The cause is unknown."	Close to the other he halted and only then did recognition dawn in his eyes.	The fist finally touched the head, still moving slowly forward, the body following as slowly.	On one side of the large cube was set a lever, a long glass panel, two vertical tubes and three clock-face indicators.	Ouglat, with every line of his face distorted with fear, flung the weapon from him, and turning, fled clumsily down the moor, with Mal Shaff at his heels.	Tell the foreman to dig out the biggest type he has.	Behind him stood a belligerent little cockney.	On the top of the large block was set a half-globe of a strange substance, somewhat, Henry thought, like frosted glass.	A hell of a fine reporter you are--can't even get a man to open his mouth.	The old scientist, during all those hours, had stood like a graven image before his machine, eyes staring fixedly at the globe.	If they came in a single conveyance, it would be too large to escape detection.
