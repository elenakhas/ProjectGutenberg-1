Nobody comes here today.	V.    --and a young horse with a green bed-quilt     on his withers shaking his head:     bared teeth and nozzle high in the air!	The sea water!	Is it for the dead     to look out or   for us to see     how well he is housed   or to see     the flowers or   the lack of them--     or what?	Bind the tips with a grass stem.	LOVE SONG     Daisies are broken     petals are news of the day     stems lift to the grass tops     they catch on shoes     part in the middle     leave root and leaves secure.	She cried me, “Haia!	I remain!	We took you for rest to that old     Yankee farm,--so lonely     and with so many field mice     in the long grass--     and you return to us     in this condition--!	--and a semicircle of dirt colored men     about a fire bursting from an old     ash can,         VII.	--they’re keen!	For Christ’s sake   not black--     nor white either--   and not polished!	“The chisel is in your hand, the block     is before you, cut as I shall dictate:     this is the coffin of Uresh-Nai,     priestess to the sky goddess,--built     to endure forever!	They’ll pass through.	He sits at the breakfast table     in his yellow hair     and disdains even the sun     walking outside     in spangled slippers:     He looks out: there is     a glare of lights     before a theater,--     a sparkling lady     passes quickly to     the seclusion of     her carriage.	In these lies my brown sea-weed,--     green quartz veins bent through the wet shale;     in these lie my pools left by the tide--     quiet, forgetting waves;     on these stiffen white star fish;     on these I slip bare footed!	Here I am with head high and a     burning heart eagerly awaiting     your caresses, whoever it may be,     for granite is not harder than     my love is open, runs loose among you!	Your death?--water     spilled upon the ground--     though water will mount again into rose-leaves--     but you?--would hold life still,     even as a memory, when it is over.	What do I care!	To keep the rain   and snow from him?	RIPOSTE     Love is like water or the air     my townspeople;     it cleanses, and dissipates evil gases.	Oh, I won’t starve     while there’s the Bible     to make them feed me.	A bunch of little flowers     for Flossie--the little ones     only:             a red clover, one     blue heal-all, a sprig of     bone-set, one primrose,     a head of Indian tobacco, this     magenta speck and this     little lavender!	Oh then, a wreath!	Yes--just!	For what purpose?	XIV.	The elm is scattering     its little loaves     of sweet smells     from a white sky!	XIII.	And instantly down the mists of my eyes     There came crowds walking--- men as visions     With expressionless, animate faces;     Empty men with shell-thin bodies     Jostling close above the gutter,     Hasting--nowhere!	Throw pieces of broken leaves     into it.	Ah!	Will that do?	And God knows it matters little for we cannot understand them.	See how the converging lines     of the hexagonal spire     escape upward--     receding, dividing!	It is I holds you--     half against the sky     half against a black tree trunk     icily resplendent!	Let it be weathered--   like a farm wagon--     with gilt wheels   (this could be     applied fresh   at small expense)     or no wheels at all:     a rough dray to   drag over the ground.	For you will not soon have another singer.	Worshippers pass in and out.	God knows.	Oh strong ridged and deeply hollowed     nose of mine!	The beauty of     the terrible faces     of our nonentities     stirs me to it:     colored women     day workers--     old and experienced--     returning home at dusk     in cast off clothing     faces like     old Florentine oak.	These things     do not happen without reason.	I     have endured my summer.	That night she came again, hovering     In rags within the filmy ceiling--     “Great Queen, bless me with thy tatters!”     “You are blest, go on!”                               “Hot for savagery,     Sucking the air!	The stone has taken up her spirit!	This house is empty     isn’t it?	PASTORAL     If I say I have heard voices     who will believe me?	Share with us     share with us--   it will be money     in your pockets.	We walked     in your father’s grove     and saw the great oaks     lying with roots     ripped from the ground.	I am an American.	The flurry     of falling petals is ended.	It’s cold.	These _live_ I tell you!	KELLER GEGEN DOM     Witness, would you--     one more young man     in the evening of his love     hurrying to confession:     steps down a gutter     crosses a street     goes in at a doorway     opens for you--     like some great flower--     a room filled with lamplight;     or whirls himself     obediently to     the curl of a hill     some wind-dancing afternoon;     lies for you in     the futile darkness of     a wall, sets stars dancing     to the crack of a leaf--     and--leaning his head away--     snuffs (secretly)     the bitter powder from     his thumb’s hollow,     takes your blessing and     goes home to bed?	First I say this: you have seen     the strange birds, have you not, that sometimes     rest upon our river in winter?	His spirit is     a white gull with delicate pink feet     and a snowy breast for you to     hold to your lips delicately!	Carve the inside     with the image of my death in     little lines of figures three fingers high.	I won’t work     and I’ve got no cash.	that I may bind it     protectingly about the wrist     of him that flung me here,     here upon the very center!	VIRTUE     Now?	We will tear     their flowers     with arms flashing!	Also     the set pieces     of your faces stir me--     leading citizens--     but not     in the same way.	Go now     I think you are   ready.	Love is     a lice comber!	Look!	Ah, mind,     see it splash!	--and the worn,     blue car rails (like the sky!)	I rose trembling at the change which the night saw!	Vibrant bowing limbs     pull downward, sucking in the sky     that bulges from behind, plastering itself     against them in packed rifts, rock blue     and dirty orange!	See them!	That’s all I care for now.	First it will be     a quiet pace     to ease our stiffness     but as the west yellows     you will be ready!	This sarcophagus contained the body     of Uresh-Nai, priestess to the goddess Mut,     Mother of All--     Run your finger against this edge!	Observe     how motionless     the eaten moon     lies in the protecting lines.	Lie basking in     the sun then--fast asleep!	On the grooved drain-board     to one side is     a glass filled with parsley--     crisped green.	WINTER QUIET     Limb to limb, mouth to mouth     with the bleached grass     silver mist lies upon the back yards     among the outhouses.	I felt the cold tips of fingers--     O crimson salamander!	Oh, black Persian cat.	Love is so precious     my townspeople     that if I were you I would     have it under lock and key--     like the air or the Atlantic or     like poetry!	Laugh!	I’d not have him ride     on the wagon at all--   damn him--     the undertaker’s   understrapper!
