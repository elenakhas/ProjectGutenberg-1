These words are such as might have been spoken by the venerable old gentleman of _Fam._, XXIV, 2.	Whenever thou wert so inclined, thou didst praise his life and ridicule his intellect.	Accordingly, the long-bearded adventurer is said to have met Petrarch at Padua during the winter of 1358-59.	And dost thou know what he says?	[95] Be thou my leader, for I am eager to hear thee sing these strains.	The only variation between these two passages is that Petrarch has substituted for the simpler statement of St. Augustine the figure of the dazzling light.	The only passages in which Plutarch mentions Seneca are “De cohibenda ira,” _Moralia_, Vol.	xiii, 13) which he had discovered earlier in the same year.	XX, _init._ In neither of these is there any praise of the philosopher.	In a letter of thanks for this favor, Petrarch draws a parallel between the two authors which is well worth quoting (_Fam._, XVIII, 4):     No words that I might pen would prove equal to your     kindness, and I feel sure that I should tire of expressing     my appreciation much sooner than you of bestowing favors.	And similarly expedient is it for him who     fears death at the hands of the enemy to sacrifice calmly the     limb by which he is fettered, in order that, though maimed, he     may effect his escape.	Even as Vergil took thee as his model, so he in his turn was chosen by Papinius Statius, whom I have mentioned above, a man renowned not merely for his intellectual powers but also for the singular charm of his manners.	Thou gatherest all the details which escaped thy master’s notice with such extreme care that (unless my judgment fail me) thou mayest be said to conquer him in diligence in just the degree that he conquers thee in eloquence.	Petrarch has simply confused the two, not being aware of the existence of the latter.	What would ever put an end to the evil, since the Hebrew philosopher most verily hath said, “The number of fools is infinite”?	Both of you ask     that I send you the volume of Plato which I managed to rescue     from the fire of my transalpine retreat.	III, p. 271).	Wonderful to relate, Rome herself, the head and center of all things, has been drained of such citizens almost to a man.	You yourself have seen him [_Aen._, vi, 495-97]:               “His body gashed and torn,         His hands cut off, his comely face         Seamed o’er with wounds that mar its grace,               Ears lopped, and nostrils shorn.”                       --(Conington, ed.	[89] You have been conquered.	[121] Furthermore, with Vergil I employed the idiom which we possessed in common; with thee I have adopted, not thy ancient language, but a certain new speech in which the letter I received was couched, a speech which I use daily, but which is not, I suppose, the one to which thou art accustomed.	5, p. 162): “i figli di sua sorella, nipoti suoi--the sons of his sister, his nephews.” Petrarch’s Latin reads (Vol.	Under thy leadership I shall visit the shores of the Cyclades, the roaring waves of Thracian Bosporus, the lonely deserts of torrid Lybia, and the cold, stormy regions of far-off Caucasus.	Time flies, and, short as it is, we waste it.	Thou didst serve as a soldier under the one; to the other thou didst address works worthy of admiration and full of the most varied learning[51]--a most remarkable fact when we consider that they were composed ’mid the widely conflicting duties of war and of peace.	III, Pt.	mem._, II, 2, “De ingenio,” p. 412:     It does not seem fitting to omit mention of Asinius Pollio,     who, as Seneca has established and as is apparent to all, must     be thought to hold the second place of honor between those two     very eloquent Romans, M. Tullius and T. Livy [Sen., _Ep._,     100, 9].	I am of the opinion that those very books on human and divine matters, which greatly increased the reputation of thy name, are still perchance in hiding somewhere, in search of which I have worn myself out these many years.	nn.	[19] Thus much concerning my second guide for Latin eloquence, thus much concerning Rome’s other hope and stay.	No mere passer-by has     ever discovered it.	_Written in the world above, in that city lying between the famous rivers Po, Ticino, Adda, and others, whence some say Milan derives its name, on the ninth of October in the thirteen hundred and sixtieth year of this last era._ NOTES ON _Fam._, XXIV, 12, TO HOMER [109].	But the moment thou dost attack his reputation for eloquence, the moment thou dost endeavor to wrest from him his supremacy in the field of oratory--a supremacy bestowed upon him from heaven and granted to him without dispute and by the common consent of nearly the entire world--that moment see to it that thou be not inflicting too palpable an injury.	Former     ages were inflicted with Macedon, son of Philip, with Dareius     and Dionysius.	[129].	These are     the first, the third, and the fourth.	As for myself,     if my health were sounder (as it was but recently), if it were     as strong as my desires, and if the road were safe, I should     not consider it irksome to seek him, not merely at Rome, but as     far as India, setting out from this very city of Padua which     gave him birth and where I have now been staying for many years.	[88] I am not so forgetful of myself as to deny thee the exercise of the same privilege in the case of a contemporary (whom thou couldst both see and know) that I have enjoyed, after so many centuries, in the case of a man of such reputation and so far removed from me in time.	The story of Homer’s death, as Petrarch and other mediaeval men knew it, must have been the one they found in Valerius Maximus; and though Petrarch does not actually cite him as his source, this clearly results from the references to Sophocles and to Philemon shortly following.	353-56).	Only tediousness and lack of interest can cause anything to seem long.	This is not the _De laude philosophiae_, but the last two of the four books of the _Academica_.” The present letter to Cicero was written in 1345, two years after the correction of his error; hence Petrarch rightly places the _De laude philosophiae_ (_sive Hortensius_) in the catalogue of lost books.	William Ramsay, in Smith’s _Dict.	(see P. de Nolhac, II, p. 15), and had been bought by Petrarch at Avignon in 1351, after the death of Soranzio (or Soranzo) Raimondo, to whom it had probably belonged (_ibid._, p. 21).	But what activity in public life, I ask, was comparable to his     leisure?	I beseech you the more urgently, not     because I am the possessor of that which even the most learned     of men may be anxious to share, but rather out of respect due     to that which I am going to tell you.	cit._, p. 194).	Am I not right?	Thou wilt find all the various points discussed in order in the _Saturnalia_.	It is not fitting that the composure of the sage should be dispelled by the affronts of fools.	The Veronese humanists are Guglielmo da Pastrengo and Rinaldo da Villafranca.	Condemned by thine own lips, he was about to depart from us when once again the mercy of Augustus snatched him from these second flames, him who seemed destined to be destroyed by fire.	Many illustrious Roman authors devoted themselves to the study     and to the development of the human speech, as you know.	We see, too, that by this slight reference to Homer, Petrarch did give some currency to the report that Homer died of grief, and did add to it a note of uncertainty.	Finally, he does not omit mention even of Varus and Gallus and of other contemporaries--a thing which jealousy would never have permitted, had he harbored such base feeling.	The reference is very indefinite: “in tranquillo rure senuisse, de perpetua illa, ut ipse quodam loco ais, non de hac iam exigua vita cogitantem” (Vol.	By Hercules, unless we had brought him aid in the nick of     time, he would have died shortly.	[94] Thou dost chisel out the characters of the ancient heroes as though in material more lasting than marble.	During life he was a great admirer of thine, and after death he must have become thy very intimate friend.	In my opinion you would have been great men, had you been able to acknowledge a greater than yourselves.	mem._ [55].	152, 153).	The form may have been destroyed, but the taste and     the odor do not perish.	I am pleased when thou dost so carefully rouse thy faithful friends by giving virtue its due reward; when thou rendest vice with gnashing teeth, and when, smiling, thou dost artfully peck at folly.	Christ is my God; Cicero, on     the other hand, is the prince of the language I use.	Horace, _Ars Poetica_, 396-401, and _Carm._, iv.	by Longfellow):     And unto him the Guide: “Vex thee not Charon;     It is so willed there where is power to do     That which is willed; and farther question not.” It borders on the sacrilegious, however, to make this reference, when we consider the One meant in the verses of Dante.	He trains him for victory in the battles of the courtroom.	Whatever be the truth concerning the geographical division of     the provinces, one thing is certain, that the Fountain of the     Sorgue is most renowned, second neither to the Campanian Nymph     nor to the Sicilian Arethusa.	In the course of a thousand and one arguments,     now this one is proved superior, now that one, and shortly     they are shown to be equal [_Sat._, v, 12, 1].	I trust, brother, that you are in good health.	With this sentiment compare the words of another enthusiastic humanist, John Addington Symonds, who writes (Preface, _op.	Before Leonzio completed his translation (which was neither poetical nor Latin: Voigt, II, p. 191), Petrarch and other mediaeval students were obliged to content themselves with the _Periochae_ of the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ which are attributed to Ausonius, and with a poor _Epitome_ of the _Iliad_ which was known as the _Homerus Latinus_ or _Pindarus Thebanus_ (P. de Nolhac, II, p. 131).	Who would not lend thee a willing ear, when thou recountest how the laws of hospitality were dishonored by the treacherous shepherd of Phrygia, and how from the quieted waves there came to Paris the threatening prophecy of Nereus?	[97] Who would not enraptured listen when thou assignest Augustus (though still alive) to a place among the stars?	[51].	But alas, thy works, conceived and elaborated with such great care, have not been deemed worthy of passing down to posterity through our hands.	that the entire populace judges your sect so unfeeling and so     perpetually under trial as to lay at your doors whatever wrong     is done within the city?	H._, VII, 53, 180.	Moreover, it is a task beyond my powers and those of any other, except perhaps of that man who will have sufficient strength to curb the passions of the mob.	Let Leonzio commence     his task with the help of God; and of the two authors he has     chosen to translate, let him begin with him who wrote so many     centuries earlier.	[140].	H._, vii, 30, 31.
