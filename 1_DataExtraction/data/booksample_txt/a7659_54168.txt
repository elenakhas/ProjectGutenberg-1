Indeed, it is remarkable that this lissome poet, whose words like bangles shook out all tunes to his step, and who lived in the very heart of the days of Poitiers--when the doughty young Black Prince kindled a martial furor that was like the old crusade craze to follow _Cœur de Lion_ to battle--remarkable, I say, that Chaucer, living on the high tide of war--living, too, in a court where he must have met Froissart, that pet of the Queen, who gloried in giving tongue to his enthusiasm about the deeds of knighthood--wonderful, I say, that Chaucer should not have brought into any of his tales or rhymes the din and the alarums and the seething passions of war.	People saw in visions the poor famished pilgrims, fainting with long marches toward the far-away Jerusalem, and shot down by cruel Saracen arrows, within sight of the Holy of Holies.	Of his larger religious and political drift no extracts will give one a proper idea; only a reading from beginning to end will do this.	1551; d. 1623.	He was a man of learning for those days--having a good estate too, and living in an orderly Kentish home, to which he went back and forth in an eight-oared barge upon the Thames.	It was almost in the shadow of the Church of St. Mary le Bow, burned in the great fire, but having its representative tower and spire--a good work of Christopher Wren--standing thereabout in our time, and still holding out its clock over the sidewalk.	He would have made a capital showman.	Yet withal, this Chaucer is in some sense a man of the world and courtier.	Richard II.	His will, however, published in these later times, shows him to have been a man of considerable means.	There, such interest is made for him that he is appointed to a secretaryship in Ireland, where the Queen’s lieutenants are stamping out revolt.	In the years following Mallory, succeeding writers poached frequently upon the old Arthur preserve--bit by bit[19]--till at last, in our day, Tennyson told his “Idyl of the King”--             “----and all the people cried,     Arthur is come again: he cannot die.	Language_) gives his percentage of Anglo-Saxon words in _Passus XIV._ at only 84.	CHAPTER IV.	But we never saw them never after.” He says there were plenty of jewels and precious stones thereabout, but “I touched none, because that the Devils be so subtle to make a thing to seem otherwise than it is, for to deceive mankind.” He tells us also of the giants Gog and Magog, and of a wonderful bird--like the roc of Arabian Nights’ fable--that would carry off an elephant in its talons, and he closes all his stupendous narratives with thanks to God Almighty for his marvellous escapes.	That _Euphues_ who gives name to his book, is an Athenian youth of rare parts--“well-constituted” as the Greek implies--who has lived long in Italy, and who talks in this strain of the ladies he saw on a visit to England:--     “The English Damoiselles have their bookes tied to their     girdles--not feathers--who are as cunning in the Scriptures as     you are in Ariosto or Petrark.	A church he erected at Bradford-on-Avon stands in almost perfect preservation to-day.	It stood on Cheapside (between Friday and Bread Streets) gorgeous with three ranges of Elizabethan windows, that gave look-out upon an array of goldsmiths’ shops which shone across the way.	At last, he set her both his eyes--     She won; and Cupid blind did rise.	After this they take away the boy-martyr from off his bier--     And in a tombe of marble stonës clere     Enclosen they his litel body swete;     Ther he is now: God leve us for to mete!	Was he a real yeoman--was he the Earl of Huntington?	Weep not, my wanton, smile upon my knee,     When thou art old, there’s grief enough for thee.” And the poet who wrote this--putting tenderness into poems of the affections, and a glowing color into pastoral verse, and point and delicacy into his prose--wrote also _A Groates worth of Wit, bought with a Million of Repentance_, and he died of a surfeit of pickled herring and Rhenish wine.	She was Protestant--but rather from policy than any heartiness of belief.	So live a woman and so live a Queen magnetized dulness into speech.	It is specially noteworthy that the existing MSS.	If, indeed, men were all honest, and women all virtuous and children all rosy and helpful, we might all live in a Utopia of our own.	Idomeneus his stern dart at Erymas addressed,   As--like to Acamas--he fled; it cut the sundry bones   Beneath his brain, betwixt his neck and foreparts, and so runs,   Shaking his teeth out, through his mouth, his eyes all drowned in blood;   So through his nostrils and his mouth, that now dart-open stood,   He breathed his spirit.” And again that wonderful duel between Patroclus and the divine Sarpedon:   “Down jumped he from his chariot, down leaped his foe as light,   And as, on some far-looking rock, a cast of vultures fight,   --Fly on each other, strike and truss--part, meet, and then stick by,   Tug, both with crooked beaks and seres, cry, fight, and fight and cry;   So fiercely fought these angry kings, and showed as bitter galls.” What a description this old Chapman would have made of a tug at foot-ball!	You would like to hear how he speaks of her:--     “It is your shame (I speak to you all young gentlemen of     England) that one mind should go beyond you all in excellency     of learning, and knowledge of divers tongues.	Something of a coxcomb I think we must reckon him; we might almost say an Oscar Wilde of letters--posing as finely and as capable of drawing female shoals in his wake.	I will not ask if you have read the _Faery Queen_: I fear that a great many dishonest speeches are made on that score; I am afraid that I equivocated myself in youngish days; but now I will be honest in saying--I never read it through continuously and of set purpose; I have tried it--on winter nights, and gone to sleep in my chair: I have tried it, under trees in summer, and have gone to sleep on the turf: I have tried it, in the first blush of a spring morning, and have gone--to breakfast.	Froissart_), I observe, avers the presence of all three--though without giving authorities.	[112] Prefacing the edition of Jonson’s works of 1816; also in the elegant re-issue of the same--under editorship of Colonel Cunningham in 1875.	1367), who came afterward to be King Henry IV.	You think this coward Falstaff may lose heart at this; not a whit of it; his eye, rolling in fat, does not blink even, while the Prince unravels the story; but at the end the stout Knight hitches up his waistband, smacks his lips:--     “D’ye think I did not know ye, my masters?	Indeed, he does not seem to us a man of action, notwithstanding his court connection and his somewhile official place;--not even a man of loudly declared public policy, but always the absorbed, introspective, painstaking, quiet observer, to whom Nature in the gross, with its humanities now kindled by wanton appetites, and now lifted by reverence and love (with the everlasting broidery of flowers and trees and sunshine), was always alluring him from things accidental and of the time--though it were time of royal Philip’s ruin, or of a conquest of Aquitaine.	We heard the quaint psalmody of Sternhold, and the sweeter and more heathen verse of Wyatt and of Surrey; lastly, I gave a sketch of that old schoolmaster, Roger Ascham, who by his life, tied the reigns of Henry and of Elizabeth together, and who taught Greek and Latin and penmanship and Archery to that proud princess--whom we encounter now--in her high ruff, and her piled-up head-dress, with a fair jewelled hand that puts a man’s grip upon the sceptre.	Yet, withal, he was a great favorite in his young days;--so tall, so trim, so stout, so rich, so free with his money.	It may well be that bluff King Harry relished more the homely Saxonism of such psalms than the _Stabat Maters_ and _Te Deums_ and _Jubilates_, which assuredly would have better pleased the Princess Katharine of Aragon.	of “_hitherto unprinted Eng.	The great Hall of Christ’s Church College, Oxford, still further serves to keep in mind the memory and the munificence of Cardinal Wolsey: it must be remembered, however, in estimating his munificence that he had only to confiscate the revenues of a small monastery to make himself full-pocketed for the endowment of a college.	[41] _House of Fame_, Book II.	But there were some to be remembered too: there was William Camden--to whom I have briefly alluded already--and of whom, when you read good histories of this and preceding reigns, you will find frequent mention.	Conquered people are never in much mood for song-singing or for history-making.	Even when he talks of friendship or marriage, death or love, a cold line of self-seeking pervades it.	CHAPTER V. When we turned the leaf upon the Balladry of England, we were upon fifteenth century ground, which, you will remember, we found very barren of great writers.	The literalists will never like him, of course; he drops words that worry him--whole lines indeed with which he does not choose to grapple; he adds words, too--whole lines, scenes almost; there is vulgarity sometimes, and coarseness; he calls things by their old homely names; there is no fine talk about the chest or the abdomen, but the Greek lances drive straight through the ribs or to the navel, and if a cut be clean and large--we are not told of crimson tides--but the blood gurgles out in great gouts as in a slaughter-house; there may be over-plainness, and over-heat, and over-stress; but nowhere weakness; and his unwieldly, staggering lines--fourteen syllables long--forge on through the ruts which the Homeric chariots have worn, bouncing and heaving and plunging and jolting, but always lunging forward with their great burden of battle, of brazen shields, and ponderous war-gods.	VI.	In 1597 he published a Greek Grammar--for the Westminster boys; he being at the time head-master of the school.	Titian was alive and working; and so was Michael Angelo and Raphael, in the great art-centres of Italy: and Venice was in this time so rich, so grand, so beautiful, so abounding in princely houses, in pictures, in books, in learning, and in all social splendors, that to pass two winters in the City of the Lagoon, was equal to the half of a polite education; and I suppose that a Florentine or Venetian or Roman of that day, thought of a pilgrimage to the far-away, murky London, as Parisians think now of going to Chicago, or Omaha, or San Francisco--excellent places, with delightful people in them; but not the centres about which the literary and art world goes spinning, as a wheel goes spinning on its hub.	Yet he finds rich rural pictures there--this idealist and dreamer: let him see only so much of sky as comes between the roofs of a city alley, and he will pluck out of it a multitude of twinkling stars; let him look upon a rood square of brown grass-land, and he will set it alight with scores of daisies and of primroses.	I cite a single sonnet that you may see his manner:--     “_Stella_, think not, that I by verse seek fame,     Who seek, who hope, who love, who live--but thee;     Thine eyes my pride, thy lips mine history.	The wits may have bantered him in Elizabeth’s day; but his journeyings were opened and closed under James.	You will tire before you are half through the Prologue, which is as long, and stiff as many a sermon.	Thus it happened with another well-known but somewhat apocryphal writer of this Transition English epoch; I mean Sir John Mandeville, whose book of travels into distant countries had a very great run.	The gossiping Paul Hentzner, who had an ambassador’s chances of observation, says of her, on her way to chapel at Greenwich:--     “Next came the Queen, in her sixty-fifth year, as we are     told--very majestic: her face, oblong, fair but wrinkled; her     eyes small, yet black and pleasant; her nose a little hooked.	Sidney was often there; and he wrote for this cherished sister his book, or poem--(call it how we will) of _Arcadia_; writing it, as he says, off-hand--and without re-reading--sheet by sheet, for her pleasure: I am sorry he ever said this; it provokes hot-heads to a carelessness that never wins results worth winning.	_Harold_--                          Edith,     The sign in Heaven--the sudden blast at sea--     My fatal oath--the dead saints--the dark dreams--     The Pope’s Anathema--the Holy Rood     That bow’d to me at Waltham--Edith, if     I, the last English King of England----     _Edith_--                               No,     First of a line that coming from the people,     And chosen by the people----     _Harold_--                  And fighting for     And dying for the people----     Look, I will bear thy blessing into the battle     And front the doom of God.	Mr. SKEAT, whose opinions overweigh the objections of Mr. WRIGHT, (_Introduction_, p.	If there were not two or three and     fifty on poor old Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.”     “Pray God, [says the Prince, keeping down his laughter] you     have not murdered some of them!”     _Falstaff._ Nay, that’s past praying for; for I peppered two     of them--two rogues in buckram.	_King._ Nay it will please him well, Kate.	It is worth one’s while to compare the two.	His _Survey_ published in 1598: reprinted over and over.	And where was this work of making books done?	There was no gallant more admired in the gayer circles of the court; he too loved Petrarch, and made canzonets like his; had a Geraldine (for a Laura), half real and half mythical.	Best edition of works edited by Rev.	Then, this Arthur mine of legends was explored again by another priest and Welshman, who came to have some place at Oxford, where the beginnings of the great university were then a-brew.	An analysis of the evidence, by Thomas Arnold, may be found in _Ency.	Did they hobnob together?	He sets before her all the dangers and the taunts that will come to her; she must forswear her friends; she must go to the forest with him; she must not be jealous of any other maiden lying _perdue_ there; she must dare all, and brave all,--     “Or else--I to the greenwood go     Alone, a banished man.” At last, having tormented her sufficiently, he confesses--that he is not an outlaw--not a banished man, but one who will give her wealth, and rank, and name and fame.	Of course she comes in for her picture in Shakespeare’s story: but he gives us an ignoble one (though not so bad as Voltaire’s in the ribald poem of _La Pucelle_).	Indeed, much as we must all admire his poetic fervor and fancies, I do not find in him traces of heroic mould;--easily friendly rather than firmly so;--full of an effusive piety, but not coming in way of martyrdom for faith’s sake;--a tenderly contemplative man, loving and sensing beauty in the same sure and abounding way in which Turner has sense of color--exhaustless in his stock of brilliant and ingenious imagery--running to similes as mountain rills run to rivers; a courtier withal--honeyed and sometimes fulsome; a richly presentable man (if portraits may be trusted), with a well-trimmed face, a cautious face--dare I say--almost a smirking face;--the face of a self-contained man who thinks allowably well of his parts, and is determined to make the most of them.	But Wyclif was not overawed by any splendors of scene or association.	He was educated at Cambridge--came to be Bishop of Worcester--wrote much, wittily and strongly.	_Hubert_--And I will.	To this epoch, of which we have talked, belongs most likely that brave ballad of Chevy Chase, which keeps alive the memory of Otterbourne, and of that woful hunting which     “Once there did, in Chevy Chase befal.	1503; d. 1542.	He was born--probably in London--some time during the second quarter of the fourteenth century;[40] and there is reason to believe that an early home of his was in or near Thames Street, which runs parallel with the river,--a region now built up and overshadowed with close lines of tall and grimy warehouses.	You may not read him; you may find his speech too old-fashioned to please you; you may not easily get through its meaning; but if you do, and come to study him with any warmth, the more you study him the more you will like him.	*       *       *       *       * In our next chapter we shall meet this prudent and accomplished Princess face to face--in her farthingale and ruff--with the jewels on her fingers, and the crown upon her head--bearing herself right royally.	He was a native of Boston, Lincolnshire; was educated at Oxford; his _History of the Acts and Monuments of the Church_ was first published in England in 1563.	In opening the preceding chapter I spoke of that dainty John Lyly, who first set a fashion in letters, and whose daintiness hid much of the strength and cleverness that were in him: I spoke of the wonderful twin development of the Lord Chancellor Bacon--selfish and ignoble as a man, serene and exalted as a philosopher; and I tried to fasten in the reader’s mind the locality of his tomb and home at the old town of St. Alban’s--a short coach-ride away from London, down in “pleasant Hertfordshire:” I spoke of Hobbes (somewhat before his turn) whose free-thinking--of great influence in its day, and the sharply succeeding days--is supplemented by more acute and subtle, if not more far-reaching, free-thinking now.	_George Chapman._ There was, however, another translation of Homer about those times, or a little earlier, which was of much rarer quality, and which has not lost its rare flavors even now.	For who so hath moore than I     That angreth me soore,     And thus I lyve love-lees,     Like a luther [mad] dogge;     That al my body bolneth [swelleth]     For bitter of my galle.
