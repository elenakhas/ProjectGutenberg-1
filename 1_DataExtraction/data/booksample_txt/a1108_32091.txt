Not a mouse, not a moth,       Not a spider but sat,     And quaked as it wondered       What next he'd be at.	Pace for pace with thee there goes     A shape that hath not come to bless.	Sea, sea, mounds of the sea,       Hollow, and dark, and blue,     Flashing incessantly       The whole sea through;       No flower, no jutting root,     Only the floor of the sea,       With foam afloat.	Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States.	No bird replies to bird on high,     Cleaving the skies with echoing cry.	Pant they their serenading on the air.	Down-adown-derry,       The daisies are few;     Frost twinkles powdery       In haunts of the dew;     And only the robin       Perched on a thorn,     Can comfort the heart       Of a father forlorn;         Singing down-adown-derry.	Know I as soon as dark's dreams begin     Snared is my heart in a nightmare's gin;     Never from terror I out may win;     So dawn and dusk I pine, peak, thin,     Scarcely beknowing t'other from which--     My great grandam--She was a Witch.	And then o'er his platter and mug, if you please,     Sate gloomily gooming at loaf and cheese--     Gooming and gooming as if the mere sight     Of his victuals could satisfy appetite!	Gill?"	Who would think, now, a throat       So lank and so thin     Might make birds seem to warble       In the dream she is in!	The primroses scattered by April,       The stars of the wide Milky Way,     Cannot outnumber the hosts of the children       Magic hath stolen away.	So Sam and his Mother by wishes three     Were made just as happy as happy can be.	Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.	Puffed within the belfry tower     Hungry owls drowse out their hour....	[Illustration] SLEEPING BEAUTY [Illustration]     The scent of bramble fills the air,       Amid her folded sheets she lies,     The gold of evening in her hair,       The blue of morn shut in her eyes.	THE DWARF [Illustration]     "Now, Jinnie, my dear, to the dwarf be off,       That lives in Barberry Wood,     And fetch me some honey, but be sure you don't laugh,--       He hates little girls that are rude, are rude,         He hates little girls that are rude."	I have heard voices calling softly                         In the little green orchard.	Names may be writ; and mounds rise;       Purporting, Here be bones:     But empty is that churchyard       Of all save stones.	In vain: for at hush of the evening       When the stars twinkle into the grey,     Seems to echo the far-away calling of children         Magic hath stolen away.	His supper for breakfast;       For wages his work;     And to warm his great hands       Just an hour in the mirk.	1.C.	"Heed not the words of the Enchantress       Who would us still betray!"	With a whoop and a flutter they swing and sway,     And surge pell-mell down the Milky Way.

They called--called--called:       Came no reply:     Nought but the ripples'       Sandy sigh.	And Sam, now lonely, lived on and on     Till most of his workaday life seemed gone.	"Lift up your eyes, you lonely Wanderer,"       She peeped from her casement small;     "Here's shelter and quiet to give you rest, young man,       And apples for thirst withal."	Nay, nay!	The third, that was a yellow man,       Out of his bundle picks a groat,     "La, by the Angel of St. Ann,         And I must go without."	[Illustration] A-TISHOO [Illustration]     "Sneeze, Pretty, sneeze, Dainty,       Else the Elves will have you sure,     Sneeze, Light-of-Seven-Bright-Candles,       See they're tippeting at the door;     Their wee feet in measure falling,     All their little voices calling,     Calling, calling, calling, calling--       Sneeze, or never come no more!"	"Thunder from midmost night it was not;       For yonder at the bars     Burn to their summer setting her       Clear constellated stars."	Seek how thou wilt to feign content,     Thy flaming ardour's quickly spent;     Soon thy last company is gone,     And leaves thee--with thyself--alone.	The woodman passed away       Along the forest path;     His ax shone keen and grey     In the last beams of day:       And all was still as death:--     Only Pan singing sweet       Out of Earth's fragrant shade;     I dreamed his eyes to meet,       And found but shadow laid     Before my tired feet.	when like roses       The clouds of the sun     Faded at dusk, gone       Was Annie Maroon;         Singing down-adown-derry.	[Illustration] SADLY, O, SADLY [Illustration]     Sadly, O, sadly, the sweet bells of Baddeley     Played in their steeples when Robin was gone,                 Killed by an arrow,                 Shot by Cock Sparrow,     Out of a Maybush, fragrant and wan.	But soon as Night's dark shadows ride     Across its shrouded Eastern side,     When at her kindling, clear and full,     Star beyond star stands visible;     Then course pale phantoms, fleet-foot deer     Lap of its waters icy-clear;     Mounts the large moon, and pours her beams     On bright-fish-flashing, singing streams;     Voices re-echo; coursing by,     Horsemen, like clouds, wheel silently.	Her lovely hands lie narrow and pale       With gilded nails, her head     Couched in its banded nets of gold       Lies pillowed on her bed.	THE ISLE OF LONE [Illustration]     Three dwarfs there were which lived in an isle,       And the name of that Isle was Lone,     And the names of the dwarfs were Alliolyle,       Lallerie, Muziomone.	They called--called--called:       Came no reply:     Nought but the ripples'       Sandy sigh.	Glide then from out their pitch-black lair     Beneath the dark's ensilvered arch,     Witches becowled into the air;     And iron pine and emerald larch,     Tents of delight for ravished bird,     Are by loud music thrilled and stirred.	SAM [Illustration]     When Sam goes back in memory,       It is to where the sea     Breaks on the shingle, emerald-green,       In white foam, endlessly;     He says--with small brown eye on mine--       "I used to keep awake,     And lean from my window in the moon,       Watching those billows break.	And there was Longlegs straddling,       And hearkening was he,     To distant Echo thrilling back       A thin "Coo-ee!"

Nay, nay!	Section  2.	He threw a pumpkin over the wall,       And melons and apples beside,     So thick in the air that to see them all fall,       She laughed, and laughed, till she cried, cried, cried;         Jane laughed and laughed till she cried.	Down-adown-derry,       There's snow in the air;     Ice where the lily       Bloomed waxen and fair;     He may call o'er the water,       Cry--cry through the Mill,     But Annie Maroon, alas!	THE CHANGELING     "Ahoy, and ahoy!"	"Down-adown-derry,"       Sang the Fairy of Doone,     Piercing the heart       Of Sweet Annie Maroon;     And lo!	Quoth the Fairy, brightly glancing in the garden;     "Where have they hidden you, you poor old Mrs.	Then no foot stirs; the brake shakes not;     Soundless and wet in its green grot     As if asleep, the leaf hangs limp;     The white dews drip untrembling down,     From bough to bough, orblike, unblown;     And in strange quiet, shimmering and still,     Morning enshrines the empty hill.	Clear to his timid mate.	Cities of men, in blindness hidden low,     Fume their faint flames to that arched firmament,     But all the dwellers in the lonely know     The unearthly are abroad, and weary and spent,     With rush extinguished, to their dreaming go.	The little Nubian boys who fan       Her cheeks and tresses clear,     Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful voices       Seem afar to hear.	[Illustration] THE HONEY ROBBERS [Illustration]     There were two Fairies, Gimmul and Mel,     Loved Earth Man's honey passing well;     Oft at the hives of his tame bees     They would their sugary thirst appease.	And drowsily drone to drone would say,     "A cold, cold wind blows in this way";     And the great Queen would turn her head     From face to face, astonish√®d,     And, though her maids with comb and brush     Would comb and soothe and whisper, "Hush!"	Says Farmer Bates,       "I puffs and I blows,     What's under the water,       Why, no man knows!"	Down-adown-derry,       Sweet Annie Maroon,     Through the green grasses       Peeps softly; and soon     Spies under green willows       A fairy whose song     Like the smallest of bubbles       Floats bobbing along;         Singing down-adown-derry.	Like droning bees       In a garden green,     Over the thwarts       They clamber in.	Climb then, and come, as quick as you can,     And dwell with the fairies, Elizabeth Ann!	"Some keener, stranger, quieter, closer       Voice it was me woke...."     And silence, like a billow, drowned       The word he spoke.	THE ENCHANTED HILL     From height of noon, remote and still,     The sun shines on the empty hill.	Then Lucy sees in clouds of gold green cherry trees up-grow,     And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow;     She smells, all faint, the almond-boughs blowing so wild and fair     And doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air.	Poor Sam stood astounded; he says, says he,     "I _wish_ my old Mother was back with me,     For if there was one thing she couldn't refuse     'Twas a sweet thick slice from the breast of a goose."

Night 'mid her flowers of glamourie spilled       Draws swiftly near:     "Night with her darkened caravans,       Piled deep with silver and myrrh,     Draws from the portals of the East,       O Wanderer near.	Then no foot stirs; the brake shakes not;     Soundless and wet in its green grot     As if asleep, the leaf hangs limp;     The white dews drip untrembling down,     From bough to bough, orblike, unblown;     And in strange quiet, shimmering and still,     Morning enshrines the empty hill.	She shone, high, wan and silvery;       Day's colours paled and died:     And, save the mute and creeping worm,       Nought else was there beside.	And lo, and forsooth!	I twirled me round and round about,       The morning sweets to smell.	I'll go to my chamber under the gable,       And the moon will lift her light     In at my lattice from over the moorland       Hollow and still and bright.

Soon the first cock will 'light       From his perch and point high     His beak at the Ploughboy       Grown pale in the sky;     And crow will he shrill;       Then, meek as a mouse,     Lob will rouse up and shuffle       Straight out of the house.	And once,       As sure as I'm alive,     Out of those wallowing, moon-flecked waves       I saw a mermaid dive;     Head and shoulders above the wave,       Plain as I now see you,     Combing her hair, now back, now front,       Her two eyes peeping through;     Calling me, 'Sam!'--quietlike--'Sam!'...	The second, that was a chestnut man,       Out of his bundle draws a bone:     "Lo, by the belfry of St. Ann,         And all my breakfast gone!"	He fed the chickens, he fed the sow,     On a three-legged stool sate down to the cow,     With a pail 'twixt his legs in the green in the meadow,     Under the elm trees' lengthening shadow;     And woke at last with a smile and a sigh     To find he had milked his poor Jingo dry.	1.F.5.	as the words he was uttering,     A rich puff of air set his candle a-guttering,     And there rose in the kitchen a sizzling and sputtering,     With a crackling of sparks and of flames a great fluttering,     And--of which here could not be two opinions--     A smoking-hot savour of sage and onions.
