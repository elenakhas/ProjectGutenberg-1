Nope."	I was so excited I was gulping instead of breathing.	It was.	I twisted out of the way.	A boy who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy.	Then he--he--" She pressed her fingernails into her palms and let out a long, glaring sigh at the door.	Suddenly we heard.	There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.	"First, Mr. Brown," she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in class, "you realize that you are not only committing the political crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?"	"Sorry, ladies, but the boy's right.	He frowned and sighted at the light globe.	"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age.	She ever...." And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn.	Then we heard some feet walking.	"I want him!_" Sis had been let go.	And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her breed of green shata.	*       *       *       *       * There was a double knock on the door and the Captain walked in without waiting for an invitation.	Sis actually staggered back.	The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble.	Sis's full lips went thin and hard, the way Mom's used to.	His hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down to his shoulders.	The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was in for it.	Passengers: Thirty-two.	Sis was going to have three hundred bridesmaids.	"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none," Sis added caustically.	She looks small and helpless, but don't forget she was trained to run an underwater city!"	There was no future for her on Earth, she figured.	"Please come right in.	That's not right for a sprouting tadpole.	She would not have allowed--this Terran Agent--" "Paddlefoot," I sneered.	They'll both be picked up at New Kalamazoo Spaceport and sent Terraward for trial."	You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen.	The Chief Mate picked me up and passed me to the Second Assistant Engineer.

Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair.	Not enough men to go around.	Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over her.	"Not what?"	I must be getting jumpy enough to splash."	I slipped away and found Butt sitting with folded arms in a corner of the brig.	"Yeah.	Sis ran the tip of her tongue kind of delicately from side to side of her mouth.	she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow a second pair of ears.	*       *       *       *       * We all waited breathlessly for Butt's reply.	I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.--Mr.--" "Hope for your sake," he said to me, "that you aren't what you seem--tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura."	That was Butt.	"Men like that are worth the mileage!"	And then I told him how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.	*       *       *       *       * I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull.	Butt Lee Brown."	She was trying to look only annoyed, but her eyes had bright little bubbles of fury popping in them.	I wished I was on that one!

There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.	Sis stepped back and measured him slowly with her eyes; there was a lot to look at.	Then I walked under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get into it.	You've got to have men who aren't afraid to make their own law if necessary--with their own guns.	Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer.	Throw the correct sexual switches, says this theory, and the female surrenders herself ecstatically to the doubtful and bloody murk of masculine plans."	He appealed to me as most of the savage ancients appealed to their women, as an emotional machine.	Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination, they call it?	*       *       *       *       * The Captain shrugged and spread his arms wide.	I told you!	It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.	Butt growled like a gusher about to blow.	"I'm not a dryleg," I told him proudly.	He _humphed_ at me, just the way Sis does, and lifted me by the scruff of my neck.	The stranger nodded violently.	Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.

On the record, no crime was ever committed.
