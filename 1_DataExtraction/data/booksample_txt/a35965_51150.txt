Picked the _Eleanor Roosevelt_ because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine and they were willing to help.	Besides, if you marry me you'll be the first mated on this ship--and that's a splash most nesting females like to make."	Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of blank wall where there should have been portholes.	"What about that promise, Sis?	Let's _what_?	Imagine having Butt for a brother-in-law and living on a wet-plantation in Flatfolk country!	"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling," he said with pretty heavy sarcasm, "but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro Continent.	He had his blaster out and was cursing very interestingly.	"Think we'd have nested out nicely."	There was no future for her on Earth, she figured.	Before I got my breath and sat up, the door had been shut again.	Then the best men went to the planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal husband, he's not much to boast about."	"You cowards!"	"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's library," I told her in a hurry.	If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.	Mr. Brown closed the door.	"Figure if you wanted a poodle, you're pretty enough to pick one up on Earth.	I'm saying let's get married, and you know it.	"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we might as well use it to migrate.	Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could help it.	How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me?	So I stowed away."	I started after him, but he picked me up by the seat of my jumper and tossed me toward the door.	The stars were exciting enough, but away off to the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding off the black of space.	There was sweat rolling down the Second Assistant's forehead; it converged at his nose and bounced off the tip in a sizable stream.	Butt?"	He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.	They were like a school of sharks that had just caught sight of a dying whale.	And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her breed of green shata.	Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair.	Now, who has been filling your head with all this nonsense?"	_Ford?_ Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand...." After that it was all over but the confession.	"--of the Mother Anita Law, SC 2136, Emergency Interplanetary Directives."	But I learned so many wonderful things about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....	All the same, I wouldn't get Mr.	He screwed up his face and howled, but he didn't let go of her arm.	He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered his blaster and pushed his green hood off.	Are you a Venusian?	On the record, no crime was ever committed.	"All he wanted--" "Sure I knew.	"Now that's a term," she said carefully, "that is used only by Venusian riffraff."	"Then _get_ one," Butt's low, lazy voice floated out.	She didn't give ground, though; I'll say that for her.	Besides, she was a girl.	My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit.	"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they?	I got no bad habits outside of having my own way.	The Captain was a round little man with a plump, golden face and a very scared look on it.	"Only a tadpole.	I've also become a male outside the law.	She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while I got sicker and sicker.	She would not have allowed--this Terran Agent--" "Paddlefoot," I sneered.	I did.	"Not what?"	We may be legal residents of Earth, but our work requires us to be on Venus several times a year.	Neither of them said anything for a bit after he let go.	There was a longish stretch of quiet.	Way back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with the wars and all.	*       *       *       *       * Butt ran over and looked down the crossway.	She stopped walking around the room as if she had been expecting to get to Venus on foot.	The purser nodded slowly.	*       *       *       *       * I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull.	"No more'n twelve--not counting five government paddlefeet, of course.	Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a surplus.	"Men like that are worth the mileage!"	No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men."	I was so excited I just had to yell: "Gee, Sis, say _yes_!"	"Hey, purse, remember when the whole family with their pop at the head went into Heatwave to argue with Colonel Leclerc?"	Named all us boys after Canadian provinces.	Something rattled to the floor.	*       *       *       *       * The Captain shrugged and spread his arms wide.	Butt told me to scat.	My brother Sas, now--"        *       *       *       *       * He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother when the dinner gong rang.	Sis was raging.	I told you!	"An honor, Miss Sparling," he said in that rumbly voice.	"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age.	I found myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis insists such things have always had for men.	"I know I did, Ferdinand, but he forced me."	Just like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns."	I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me.	The crew, officers and men, all go along with me.	Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.
