However, for the minute he had to converse with his host, Lord Channelcliffe, and almost the first thing that friend said to him was: 'Who is that pretty woman in the black dress with the white fluff about it and the pearl necklace?'	she murmured in surprise.	They sat opposite each other in an empty compartment, and the tedious railway journey began.	He could not help seeing in her all that he knew of another, and veiling in her all that did not harmonize with his sense of metempsychosis.	Why, how old are you?--you have never told me.’ ‘I am very old.’ ‘My mother’s, and my grandmother’s,’ said she, looking at him no longer as at a possible husband, but as a strange fossilized relic in human form.	The pedestrian was what he looked like--a young man from London and the cities of the Continent.	Perhaps I can help you.	‘Very well then, dear.	Come, Avice, why not tell me exactly how things are?'	Surely the life would just suit you?	She would reappear, it might be, in an at first unnoticed lady, met at some fashionable evening party, exhibition, bazaar, or dinner; to flit from her, in turn, after a few months, and stand as a graceful shop-girl at some large drapery warehouse into which he had strayed on an unaccustomed errand.	Pierston however dismissed the strange impression, arguing that even if the information sent him of Avice's death should be false--a thing incredible--that sweet friend of his youth, despite the transfiguring effects of moonlight, would not now look the same as she had appeared nineteen or twenty years ago.	he urged again.	She had worn the guise of strange women; she had been a woman of every class, from the dignified daughter of some ecclesiastic or peer to a Nubian Almeh with her handkerchief, undulating to the beats of the tom-tom; but all these embodiments had been endowed with a certain smartness, either of the flesh or spirit: some with wit, a few with talent, and even genius.	Near him moved six men bearing a long box, and two or three persons in black followed.	By degrees he could not exist long without this sound.	'Why don't you ever let me see you, Marcia?'	The ‘bo-fet,’ or double corner-cupboard, where the china was formerly kept, had disappeared, its place being taken by a plain board.	'Indeed!'	Pierston surveyed him.	'Ah, your name is not the same as your mother's!'	What these displacements might betoken saddened his humanity less than it cheered his primitive instinct in pointing out how her necessities might bring them together.	She gradually disclosed herself in the character of a deserted young wife, and later on I met her in the street without the child.	He could not help seeing in her all that he knew of another, and veiling in her all that did not harmonize with his sense of metempsychosis.	The subject of her discourse he cared nothing about--it was no more his interest than his concern.	He is much older than you; but, in spite of it, that you will ever get a better husband I don’t believe.	He was more than ever struck with what this signified--her father's obstinate antagonism to her union with one of his blood and name.	It took him past the cottage in which the new Avice was born, from whose precincts he had heard her first infantine cry.	Almost frantic he again descended and let himself out of the house, moving towards a more central part, where the roar still continued.	*          *          * Whenever she unexpectedly came to the castle he started, and lost placidity.	However, a pleasure which obliterated all this arose when Pierston drew near to the house that was likely to be his dear home on all future visits to the isle, perhaps even his permanent home as he grew older and the associations of his youth re-asserted themselves.	As they reached the landau he told her that he should be back in town himself again soon, and would call immediately.	The colour of the dust never ceased to amaze her.	‘You cannot live your life and keep it, Jocelyn,’ he said.	he remarked tartly.	By the accident of being a bachelor, he was floating in society without any soul-anchorage or shrine that he could call his own; and, for want of a domestic centre round which honours might crystallize, they dispersed impalpably without accumulating and adding weight to his material well-being.	The two servants who had been left to take care of the house were in their own quarters, and he went out unobserved.	'I hope so--for baby's sake,' she said, with a bright sigh.	They are rather an extra stab for the poor boy.'	He informed her that they were picked up by the lightship men, and afterwards, at their request, taken across to the opposite shore, where they landed, proceeding thence on foot to the nearest railway station and entering the train for London.	Her bed was close to the staircase, from which it was divided by a lath partition only, and her consciousness either was or seemed to be aroused by light brushing touches on the outside of the partition, as of fingers feeling the way downstairs in the dark.	'I did, sir; of course I did,' said the girl, who tripped so lightly that it seemed he might have carried her on his hand.	The artistic sense had left him, and he could no longer attach a definite sentiment to images of beauty recalled from the past.	Their progress was continually checked.	But I shall be at the island--looking at a dead woman’s grave.’ As he spoke his eyes turned, and remained fixed on a table near.	Like the island it was all of stone, not only in walls but in window-frames, roof, chimneys, fence, stile, pigsty and stable, almost door.	He began wondering now how much remained of that presentation after forty years.	After all, her parentage was as good as his own; it was misfortune that had sent her down to this.	After ten minutes given to a preoccupied regard of shoulder-blades, back hair, glittering headgear, neck-napes, moles, hairpins, pearl-powder, pimples, minerals cut into facets of many-coloured rays, necklace-clasps, fans, stays, the seven styles of elbow and arm, the thirteen varieties of ear; and by using the toes of his dress-boots as coulters with which he ploughed his way and that of Lady Mabella in the direction they were aiming at, he drew near to Mrs. Pine-Avon, who was drinking a cup of tea in the back drawing-room.	Thus during the first year of Miss Bencomb’s absence, when absolutely bound to keep faith with the elusive one’s late incarnation if she should return to claim him, this man of the odd fancy would sometimes tremble at the thought of what would become of his solemn intention if the Phantom were suddenly to disclose herself in an unexpected quarter, and seduce him before he was aware.	‘When the whole dream came to an end through her father leaving the island, I thought my Well-Beloved had gone for ever (being then in the unpractised condition of Adam at sight of the first sunset).	‘You do not look so; and I thought that what you looked you were.’ ‘And you--you are very young,’ he continued.	She rose, put on her hat, and accompanied him to the door.	In a short time the enmity of their families would have proved a fruitful source of dissension; Juliet would have gone back to her people, he to his; the subject would have split them as much as it splits us.’ Pierston laughed a little.	'I hope so, sir.'	They grew enormously rich, sold out, and disappeared altogether from the island which had been their making.	'Thank you again.	‘Though I had already learnt that the absence of the corporeal matter did not involve the absence of the informing spirit, I could scarce bring myself to believe that in this case it was possible for her to return to my view without the form she had last inhabited.	Nothing now pleased him so much as to spend that portion of the afternoon which he devoted to out-door exercise, in haunting the purlieus of the wharves along the Thames, where the stone of his native rock was unshipped from the coasting-craft that had brought it thither.	he said severely.	The Caros, like some other local families, suggested a Roman lineage, more or less grafted on the stock of the Slingers.	They brought it up from that sinister Bay to the west, whose movement she and he were hearing now.	I may just as well make a clean breast of it now as later.'	'I will see her myself.	He made it appear that he had not noticed her distress, and they discussed some arrangements of furniture.	'Well--you don't know her yet,' replied Jocelyn, who could give praise where he could not give love.	His voice was energetic, and, though slightly touchy, it showed, on the whole, a disposition to set things right.	Poor mother married her cousin.'	'I have no love to give, you know, Marcia,' he said.	At that moment he encountered his amiable host, and almost simultaneously caught sight of the lady who had at first attracted him and then had disappeared.	'That's right: take courage!'	‘Yes, Ike left me comfortable.	He saw that it was death, though she appeared to have breathed her last only a few moments before.	Tell it to all the island: say that a man came to marry a wife, and didn't find her at home.	It is all arranged,’ said he.

His record moved on with the years, his sentiments stood still.	This son is doen great things in London as a’ image-carver; and I can mind when, as a boy, ‘a first took to carving soldiers out o’ bits o’ stwone from the soft-bed of his father’s quarries; and then ‘a made a set o’ stwonen chess-men, and so ‘a got on.	The streets below were immersed in shade, the front of the church of the Trinita de’ Monti at the top was flooded with orange light, the gloom of evening gradually intensifying upon the broad, long flight of steps, which foot-passengers incessantly ascended and descended with the insignificance of ants; the dusk wrapped up the house to the left, in which Shelley had lived, and that to the right, in which Keats had died.	'I've just come in by to-day's boat,' he added.	V. A CHARGE The rain fell upon the keel of the old lerret like corn thrown in handfuls by some colossal sower, and darkness set in to its full shade.	'Troubles and sickness raise all sorts of fears, Mr. Pierston,' she said.	She said she thought she could come.
