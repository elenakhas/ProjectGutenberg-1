Maybe there is no machine, and it's just easier for us to imagine it.	You look at your watch and it's still running.	I'd told you that, too, but you've forgotten.	You put one leg in front of the other and you begin racing down the walk, ducking past people, who stare at you with expressions you haven't time to see.	There is no button on it.	*       *       *       *       * Reaction sets in a bit and your knees begin to buckle, but you shake your head and come up for air.	Around you, you hear some pretty normal English, but there are others using stuff as garbled as his.	We have to walk up a flight of stairs, and there is an elevator waiting, fortunately with the door open.	The guard can get the same and be there before you.	It gives out a coughing noise and the basement openings begin to click by us.	Then a shred of dim light appears; it's the weak light in the time machine.	Your finger touches the red button.	The museum's closed, but I'll be glad to let you study whatever you need for realism in your role.	Then the machine stops--at least, the field around us cuts off.	Then it comes to you slowly that you're actually traveling in time.	You don't wait to find out about that, either.	Fine, I won't have to give you an appearance schedule.	They are building lower than they used to, apparently.	The field springs up around you and the next button you touch--the one on the board that hasn't been used so far--sends you off into nothingness.	It'd be foolish to take the early model if you can get one with built-in magnetic current terminals--Ehrenhaft or some other principle?--and nuclear binding-force energy terminals.	You stumble down the stairs, feeling all the futuristic rays in the world on your back, and still nothing happens.	You reach forward toward the green button and hesitate.	There's a room on your right filled with something that proclaims itself the first truly plastic diamond former, and you go up to it.	You stop at a sign that announces: _Trav:l Biwrou--F:rst-Clas Twrz--Marz, Viin*s, and x: Trouj:n Planets.	The cop catches your arm and you know you're not going to get away, so you stop.	It forms a perfect door and the elevator stands there waiting.	And, finally, you're right back beside the original first model.	"No place for it to go," I explain.	They state that it has all major refinements, operating on any fuel, producing electricity at any desired voltage up to five million, any chosen cyclic rate from direct current to one thousand megacycles, and any amperage up to one thousand, its maximum power output being fifty kilowatts, limited by the current-carrying capacity of the outputs.	Except for the short legs in his suit and the friendly grin on his face, he looks like any other guard.	"Oh, that explains it.	As you come near, it goes through a crazy wiggle inside, stops turning out a continual row of what seem to be bearings, and slips something the size of a penny toward you.	The gate is swung to behind you, but obviously he isn't locking it.	What's more, he speaks pretty clearly.	"Maybe it's no dimension--or it might be the fifth; if you're going to skip over the so-called fourth without traveling along it, you'd need a fifth.	You feel a dankish sort of air replace the stale air, and you breathe easier, though we're in complete darkness, except for the weak light in the machine, which always burns, and a few feet of rough dirty cement floor around.	Lord, the genius of that twentieth century inventor!	"You go that way.	In spite of Einstein, you have always had the idea that time is an effect of gravity, and I sort of agree, still.	You can't feel any motion, of course.	"I--I'm told I should investigate your display of atomic generators."	Well, you stagger down the corridor, looking out for the guard, but all seems clear.	The pedestrian grins, looks at his watch, and nods.	While you're searching for an answer, the guard pulls something out of his pocket and stares at it.	Here, let me grab you a taxi."	You'll be puzzling over what I'll tell you, and you'll be getting used to the idea that you are the man who makes atomic power practical.	You still feel gravity, but I can't explain that, either.	You start to say something, but by then I'm pressing a black button, and everything outside will disappear.	A second later, you see me going by, mixed into a crowd that is loafing along toward a restaurant, or something like it, that is just opening.	You notice that the models are all mounted on tables and that they're a lot smaller than you thought.	But all the same, the organized cooperation here doesn't look too good.	You must be playing in 'Atoms and Axioms.'	The mayor of Altasecarba--Centaurian, you know--is arriving, but I'll be back in about ten minutes.	"This is like the things they wear in this century, as near as I can remember it, and I should be able to pass fairly well.	*       *       *       *       * I'll be tired of talking by then, and in a hurry to get going.	You won't exactly believe it, but you'll want to go along.	The luggage section isn't protected, though.	You'll never know what you stumbled over, but, somehow, you move back in the direction of the time machine, bumping against boxes, staggering here and there, and trying to find the right place by sheer feel.	You suddenly realize that everything in the machine is wide open, yet you haven't seen any effects of air loss.	*       *       *       *       * We get in the elevator, and I say "first" to it.	"They go with the generator--we don't like to have them separated.	A big sign on the ceiling gives a lot of dope on atomic generators, explaining that this is the first invention which leaped full blown into basically final form.	*       *       *       *       * By that time, you're almost convinced.	Doesn't hurt, and when you pull your arm back, you're still sound and uninjured.	So I'll keep on talking.	He told me, just as I'm telling you, that it's an interstellar civilization."	I've gotten past that stage in worrying about all this.	You get away from him, finally, after some polite thanks.	You've located it.	You start looking for other doors or corridors, but you know this is right.	You expect a warning bell, but nothing happens.	Out there is neither time nor space, apparently.	Twenty floors up seems about the maximum.	You get up your courage and go up to a boy selling something that might be papers on tapes.	"As near as I can guess, it's about 2150.	*       *       *       *       * Then there's a sort of cough and something dilates in the wall.	You turn to me, getting used to the idea.	Just let us know when you're finished with the model and we'll pick it up."	That means you either carry a small time field with you, or you are catching a small increment of time from the main field.	So you go to the end and look over the thing.	Professor Jonas was using them to check his latest theory of how they work.	You'll see later why I couldn't have invented the machine.	"But...." I let it go, and so do you.
