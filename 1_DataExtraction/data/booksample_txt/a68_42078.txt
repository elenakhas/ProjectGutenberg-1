Nothing has been done as to S. and S.[23] The books came to hand too late for him to have time for it before he went.	Yours affectionately,      JANE AUSTEN.	LXII.	Yours very truly,        J.	Aunt Cass.	As yet the gentlemen only have visited, as Mrs. B. is ill; but she is a nice-looking woman, and wears one of the prettiest straw bonnets in the place.	Charles is not come yet, but he must come this morning, or he shall never know what I will do to him.	she has been suffering indeed, but is now in a comparative state of comfort.	I had just left off writing and put on my things for walking to Alton, when Anna and her friend Harriot called in their way thither; so we went together.	A. I have just asked Caroline if I should send her love to her godmamma, to which she answered "Yes."	XXV.	Get all the information, therefore, about it that you can from Mrs. C. Cage.	We are going to each house at Chilham and to Mystole.	She is dressed in a white gown, with green ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always supposed, that green was a favorite color with her.	MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I had a very good journey, not crowded, two of the three taken up at Bentley being children, the others of a reasonable size; and they were all very quiet and civil.	God be praised that you can say what you do of him: that he has a religious mind to bear him up, and a disposition that will gradually lead him to comfort.	We have heard nothing fresh from Anna.	She has engaged a new maidservant in Mrs. Calker's room, whom she means to make also housekeeper under herself.	.	I have sent the same extract of the sweets of Gambier to Charles, who, poor fellow, though he sinks into nothing but an humble attendant on the hero of the piece, will, I hope, be contented with the prospect held out to him.	These are all of our acquaintance who have yet met our eyes.	I could not have settled it better myself, and am glad they found so much in the house to approve, and I hope they will ask Martha to visit them.	On Saturday, soon after breakfast, Mr. J. P. left us for Norton Court.	The ceremony must be over before ten o'clock, as the cathedral service begins at that hour, so that we shall be at home early in the day, for there will be nothing to keep us here afterwards.	.	Put this into your capacious head.	Miss AUSTEN,     Godmersham Park, Faversham.	We send best love to dear little Lizzy and Marianne in particular.	Her disorder is an inflammation on the lungs, arising from a severe chill taken in church last Sunday three weeks; her mind all pious composure, as may be supposed.	LI.	All that you are to see of Streatham, seen already!	Don't say a word.	You have given many particulars of the state of Chawton House, but still we want more.	My brother has a letter from Louisa to-day of an unwelcome nature; they are to spend the winter at Bath.	XXIX.	Only think of the Marquis of Granby being dead.	I did not like him, either.	GODMERSHAM PARK, Wednesday (Nov. 3).	we have had no bad ones here.	When you receive this, our guests will be all gone or going; and I shall be left to the comfortable disposal of my time, to ease of mind from the torments of rice puddings and apple dumplings, and probably to regret that I did not take more pains to please them all.	I must alter it to the Commissioner's.	.	By favor of Mr. GRAY.	Dr. Parry seems to be half starving Mr. Bridges, for he is restricted to much such a diet as James's, bread, water and meat, and is never to eat so much of that as he wishes, and he is to walk a great deal,--walk till he drops, I believe,--gout or no gout.	He meant to ask for five days more, and if they were granted, to go down by Thursday night's mail, and spend Friday and Saturday with you; and he considered his chance of succeeding by no means bad.	The morning was so wet that I was afraid we should not be able to see our little visitor; but Frank, who alone could go to church, called for her after service, and she is now talking away at my side and examining the treasures of my writing-desk drawers,--very happy, I believe.	Henry does not neglect it; he has hurried the printer, and says he will see him again to-day.	What a pity it is that he should not be in England at the time of this promotion, because he certainly would have had an appointment, so everybody says, and therefore it must be right for me to say it too.	There were but fifty people in the room; very few families indeed from our side of the county, and not many more from the other.	On Friday we are to be snug with only Mr. Barlowe and an evening of business.	My china crape is still kept for the ball.	No James and Edward yet.	I go and refresh myself every now and then, and then come back to solitary coolness.	Her previous service must have fitted her for such a place as yours, and she is very active and cleanly.	were to see him now, I feel sure that you would think him improved since Monday.	He desires his best love to you, and has not written because he has not been able to decide.	It was past nine before we were sent for, and not twelve when we returned.	I am thoroughly rejoiced that Miss Benn has placed herself in lodgings, though I hope they may not be long necessary.	BY this time, my dearest Cassandra, you know Martha's plans.	Mr. Peter Debary has declined Deane curacy; he wishes to be settled near London.	I wish she were not so very Palmery, but it seems stronger than ever.	Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!)	LIV.	Our dinners have certainly suffered not a little by having only Molly's head and Molly's hands to conduct them; she fries better than she did, but not like Jenny.	Mrs. Clement is very welcome to her little boy, and to my congratulations into the bargain, if ever you think of giving them.	A. expresses her fear of our settling in Kent, and, till this proposal was made, we began to look forward to it here; my mother was actually talking of a house at Wye.	I am very rich.	When I return thither, if Mrs. K. will give me leave, I will send them to her.	I am much obliged to you for meaning to leave my old petticoat behind you.	Mrs. Bertie lives in the Polygon, and was out when we returned her visit, which are her two virtues.	Not at all shy, of course.	St.	He is more comfortable here than I thought he would be, and so is Elizabeth, though they will both, I believe, be very glad to get away--the latter especially, which one can't wonder at somehow.	We shall find him there on Thursday.	I don't think little Fanny is quite so pretty as she was; one reason is because she wears short petticoats, I believe.	One must hope the impression will be strong, and yet one's heart aches for a dejected mind of eight years old.	Anna is nursing a cold caught in the arbor at Faringdon, that she may be able to keep her engagement to Maria M. this evening, when I suppose she will make it worse.	We were very well entertained, and could have stayed longer but for the arrival of my list shoes to convey me home, and I did not like to keep them waiting in the cold.	Sir Edward Pollen succeeds Lord Gambier in his command, and some captain of his succeeds Frank; and I believe the order is already gone out.	I wish the poor little girls had better weather for their journey; they must amuse themselves with watching the raindrops down the windows.	Lady Robert is delighted with P. and P.,[21] and really was so, as I understand, before she knew who wrote it, for of course she knows now.	XXII.	When William returns to Winchester Mary Jane is to go to Mrs. Nune's for a month, and then to Steventon for a fortnight, and it seems likely that she and her aunt Martha may travel into Berkshire together.
