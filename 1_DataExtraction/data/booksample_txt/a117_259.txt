The mountains pose in their ermine, in golden the hills are clad;      The big, blue, silt-freighted Yukon seethes by my cabin door,       And I think it's only the river that keeps me from going mad.	The Trail of Ninety-Eight      I.	A grave deep, deep, with the moon a-peep,            A grave in the frozen mould.	Oh, how we cursed their weakness, anguish they could not tell,      Breaking their hearts in our passion, lashing them on till they fell!	They rolled around with a soundless sound like softly bruised silk;      They poured into the bowl of the sky with the gentle flow of milk.	They were savage and dire; they were whiskered with fire;        they bickered like malamute dogs.	Oh, in the night I fear,       Haunted by nameless things,      Just for a voice to cheer,       Just for a hand that clings!	This awful hush that hugs      And chokes one is enough       To make a man go "bugs".	I'll swear I was mild as I'd be with a child,        but he called me the son of a slut;      And, grabbing his gun with a leap and a run,        he threatened my face with the butt.	Oh, it gazed for a moment's space,            Wild and wan, and was gone again!	the voice of the waters, "Haste!"	did somebody holler?	Let the jammy banjo voice the Younger Son,       Who waits for his remittance to arrive;      I represent the grimy, gritty one,       Who sweats his bones to keep himself alive;      Who's up against the real thing from his birth;       Whose heritage is hard and bitter toil;      I voice the weary, smeary ones of earth,       The helots of the sea and of the soil.	ha!	My eyes were seared, yet thralled I peered        through the parka hood nigh blind;      But I staggered on to the lights that shone, and never I looked behind.	With curses he harried me forth;      Then he was alone, and I was alone, and over us menaced the North.	You'd follow it in hunger, and you'd follow it in cold;       You'd follow it in solitude and pain;      And when you're stiff and battened down let someone whisper "Gold",       You're lief to rise and follow it again.	The Telegraph Operator      I will not wash my face;       I will not brush my hair;      I "pig" around the place--       There's nobody to care.	But no; they brewed me the green-spruce tea,        and nursed me there like a child;      And the homicide he was good to me, and bathed my sores and smiled;      And the thief he starved that I might be fed,        and his eyes were kind and mild.	There in the frozen vastness Clancy fought with his foes;       The ache of the stiffened fingers, the cut of the snowshoe thong;      Cheeks black-raw through the hood-flap, eyes that tingled and closed,       And ever to urge and cheer him quavered the madman's song.	And now he is getting even, landing me down in the hole.	II.	*    *    *    *    *      Mother, your boy is crying, out in the night and cold;       Let me in and forgive me, I'll never be bad any more:      I'm, oh, so sick and so sorry:  please, dear mother, don't scold--       It's just your boy, and he wants you.	Swiftly, serenely it nears;      A proud, white, alien presence, a glittering galley of light,       Confident-poised, triumphant, freighted with hopes and fears.	They ravined in rings like iniquitous things;        they gulped down the Green and the Blue.	He hinted of a hidden trove, and when I made so bold           To question his veracity, this is the tale he told._      "I do not seek the copper streak, nor yet the yellow dust;      I am not fain for sake of gain to irk the frozen crust;      Let fellows gross find gilded dross, far other is my mark;      Oh, gentle youth, this is the truth--I go to seek the Ark.	'Twas in the fall of nineteen four--leap-year I've heard them say--      When Hard-Luck came to Hunker Creek and took a hillside lay.	Hark to the tups and wethers;            Hark to the old gray ram:           "We're all of us white, but he's black as night,            And he'll never be worth a damn_."	I'm a humble little bit of tin and horn;       I'm a byword, I'm a plaything, I'm a jest;      The virtuoso looks on me with scorn;       But there's times when I am better than the best.	.	cries the master of the floor;       The music throbs with soft, seductive beat.	Weary and worn and old are we)--           Only the snow and a wounded loon--           Rest and sleep, 'twill be morning soon.	I was weak--oh, so weak--but I thrilled at its shriek,        as wildly it fled in the night;      And deathlike I lay till the dawn of the day.	The morrow was come, and Tellus swiftly stole up the hill.	"Klondike or bust!"	Beaten back to my corner, how can I hope to win?	Cold with its creeping terror, cold with its sudden clinch;       Cold so utter you wonder if 'twill ever again be warm;      Clancy grinned as he shuddered, "Surely it isn't a cinch       Being wet-nurse to a looney in the teeth of an arctic storm."	Nothing but rock and tree;       Nothing but wood and stone,      Oh, God, it's hell to be       Alone, alone, alone!	He shall hear their mock in the market-place,             their fleering jibe at the feast;           He shall seek the caves and the shroud of night,             and the fellowship of the beast.	I kept on making misses; but at last I've got my stake;       There's no more thawing frozen muck for me.	Yet there was never a sign of wound, and never a drop he bled.	See paragraph 1.C below.	Each eye was a pin that shot out and in, as, squidlike, it oozed to my bed;      So softly it crept with feelers that swept        and quivered like fine copper wire;      Its belly was white with a sulphurous light,        it jaws were a-drooling with fire.	Straight to his anvil he hurried; started his furnace aglow;      Heated his iron and shaped it with savage and masterful blow.	Never were hearts so uplifted, never were hopes so high.	I'm not a man of the quitting kind, but I never felt so blue      As I sat there gazing at that stiff and studying what I'd do.	I'm thinking out aloud;       I reckon that is bad;      (The snow is like a shroud)--       Maybe I'm going mad.	Lord!	I knew that he nursed a malice accurst,        like the blast of a winnowing flame;      I pleaded aloud for a shield, for a shroud--Oh, God!	Where in the world have I got to?	What will they find, I wonder, when they come to the end of my track--       A hand stuck out of a snowdrift, frozen and stiff and white.	Yet they were woefully wicked men, and often at night in pain      I heard the murderer speak of his deed and dream it over again;      I heard the poor thief sorrowing for the dead self he had slain.	Ah!	Curse on my feet that slip so, my poor tired, stumbling feet--       I guess they're a job for the surgeon, they feel so queerlike to lift--      I'll rest them just for a moment--oh, but to rest is sweet!	don't get so glum       And sick of everything;      The worst is yet to come;       God help you till the Spring.	There in our awe we crouched and saw with our wild, uplifted eyes      Charge and retire the hosts of fire in the battlefield of the skies.	The Man from Eldorado      He's the man from Eldorado, and he's just arrived in town,       In moccasins and oily buckskin shirt.	Oh, some they were blue, and they slithered right through;        they were silent and squashy and round;      And some they were green; they were wriggly and lean;        they writhed with so hateful a sound.	That night the wife of his bosom, the light of joy in her eyes,      Kissed him with words of rapture; but he knew that her words were lies.	"For look ye, the skin--it's as smooth as sin,        and black as the core of the Pit.	And the O. C. said:  "You are guilty", and I said never a word;      For, hang it, you see I couldn't--I didn't know WHAT had occurred,      And, under the circumstances, denial would be absurd.	The awful wind cannot get me, deep, deep down in the drift."	It's so in the town report.	Mother, open the door.	So sad it seemed, and its cheek-bones gleamed,        and its fingers flicked the shore;      And it lapped and lay in a weary way, and its hands met to implore;      That I gently said:  "Poor, restless dead, I would never work you woe;      Though the wrong you rue you can ne'er undo, I forgave you long ago."	They drank unto his wife to be--that unsuspecting maid;       They drank unto his children half a score;      And when they got through drinking very tenderly they laid       The man from Eldorado on the floor.	Once, twice and thrice he forced her, heedless of prayer and shriek--      Once on the forehead of Philo, twice in the soft of his cheek.	I've learned the lore of my river; my river obeys me well.	I gave him excuse, I bore his abuse in every way that I could;      I swore to prevail; I camped on his trail;        I plotted and planned for his good.	But I followed it o'er the seamless waste, and I found him at shut of day,      Naked there as a new-born babe--so I left him where he lay.	"_           _"Mother, mother, why should you fear?	But somehow I have bucked you up a bit;       And, as you turn around and face the wall,      You don't feel quite so spineless and unfit--       You're not so bad a fellow after all.	In the heat of the hearth-fire embers he heated the hideous Brand;      Twisting her fingers open, he forced its haft in her hand.	And up the swift and oozy drift a woman climbed in fear,      Clutching to her a black fox fur as if she held it dear;      And hard she pressed it to her breast--then Windy Ike drew near.	Say, this is mighty queer!	Day after day was sinister, and I fought fierce-eyed despair,      And I clung to life, and I struggled on, I knew not why nor where.	We tightened our girths and our pack-straps; we linked on the Human Chain,      Struggling up to the summit, where every step was a pain.	We roused Lake Marsh with a chorus, we drifted many a mile;      There was the canyon before us--cave-like its dark defile;      The shores swept faster and faster; the river narrowed to wrath;      Waters that hissed disaster reared upright in our path.	So I thought of the contract I'd made with him,        and I took down from the shelf      The swell black box with the silver plate he'd picked out for hisself;      And I packed it full of grub and "hooch", and I slung it on the sleigh;      Then I harnessed up my team of dogs and was off at dawn of day.	(Was ever so welcome the light?)	.	Dared we that ravening terror; heard we its din in our ears;      Called on the Gods of our fathers, juggled forlorn with our fears;      Sank to our waists in its fury, tossed to the sky like a fleece;      Then, when our dread was the greatest, crashed into safety and peace.
