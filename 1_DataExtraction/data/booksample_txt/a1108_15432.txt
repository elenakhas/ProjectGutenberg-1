I do not think I was disturbed, though I confess to having been a little amazed to see how profound this valley was into which we were descending, yet how swiftly climbed the sun, as if to pace with us so that we should not be in shadow, howsoever fast we journeyed.	cried Electra, laying a lip upon a cherry.	I looked and looked again--saw the green-grey folds, the tawny locks, the mistletoe, the unearthly eyes of this unstirring figure, yet, when I advanced but one strenuous pace, saw nought--only the little leaden boys and the porch between them.	Within reach of my hand lay the creature who had carried me, huddled and motionless; and to left and to right of me, and one a little nearer the base of the cliff, five of those sorrel horses that had been chief of our pursuers.	I am afraid, as much to my amusement as wonder, I discovered that this landlady of so much apparent _bonhomie_ was a deaf-mute.	"Pan will protect me," she said.	I fancied even her bland face smiled, as might elderliness on youth.	there squats a pestilent sweet notion in that chamber could spellican but set him capering.	Lad's days and all--'twas life, Tittany; and I was ever foremost.	Take thy stars,           My tears then leave me;         Thine my bliss,           As thine to grieve me;     Take.... For then, so insidious was the music, and not quite of this earth the voice, my senses altogether forsook me, and I fell asleep.	But whether it is that the Fair is more difficult to arrive at than to depart from, or is really a hard day's journey even from the gay parlour of the World's End, it already began to be evening, and yet no sign of bunting or booth or clamour or smoke.	I had no doubt of his dogs, however, and walked scarcely at ease beside him, while they, shadow-footed, closely followed us at heel.	Something like laughter, or, as it were, the clapper of a scarer of birds, echoed among the rocks at the rattling of the rowlocks.	"Well, one thing Christian had, and none can deny it," said Pliable, a little hotly, "and that was Imagination?	"What, then, is to change,... to be fickle?"	It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.	But none stirred, nor went, nor came.	Ay, Yahoo, and do vicious men rule, and attain riches; and impious women pomp and flattery?--hypocrites, pandars, envious, treacherous, proud?"	"He is a great talker," whispered Reverie in my ear.	he cried delightedly again and again in my ear, eager apparently for my approval.	I bowed and murmured an apology for my intrusion, just as I might perhaps to some apparition of nightmare that over-stayed its welcome.	This was an air for the sun-disdaining eagle, a country of transcendent brightness, its flowers strangely pure and perfect, its waters more limpid, its grazing herds, its birds, its cedar trees, the masters of their kind.	And yet, in spite of the renown of these regions, he can present neither map nor chart of them, latitude nor longitude: can affirm only that their frontier stretches just this side of Dream; that they border Impossibility; lie parallel with Peace.	By good fortune I discovered her beneath the greenish moon that hung amid mist above the forest, stretching a disconsolate neck at the waterside as if in search of the Lorelei.	We journeyed softly on till I lost all count of time, lost, too, all guidance; for as a flower falls had vanished Mustardseed.	I remained quite still in this mouldering hut looking out on the glens where fell the sunlight.	To her then, leaving Rosinante in an ecstasy of timidity before such god-like boys, I addressed myself.	xi.).	hushie now, here he floats; sit still, sit still--I hear his wings.	XV     _'Tis now full tide 'tween night and day._     --JOHN WEBSTER.	And then, as if to show me to my place forthwith, a great fleshy fellow that sat close beside the hearth this summer evening continued in a loud voice the conversation I had interrupted.	Once he started, raised his arm, and cried out as if acting again in dream some frenzy of the past.	I informed him that I was as ignorant as he what power had spirited me to his house, but that so far as obvious means went, my old horse was probably by this time fast asleep beside the green gate at which I had entered.	Down we went, alone, yet not unhappy, until in a while I discovered, about a hundred yards in advance of me, another traveller on the road, ambling easily along at an equal pace with mine.	"And this thick rosemary-bush that smells of exile, who, then, is that?"	We plodded earnestly after our gaunt shadow in the dust, and ever downward, till at last we drew so near to the opposite steep that I could well nigh count its pines.	He left the room.	"I beseech you, sir," he replied, "say no more!	The darkness was astir.	It was late, too, for few candles gleamed beneath the moonlight from the windows round about the smooth village-green.

"An inn," I cried in his ear, "I want lodging, supper--a tavern, an inn!"	I seemed to hear their laughter clearer now that the jest was forgotten, and to admire better the pomp, and the mirth, and the grace, and the vanity, now that time had so far travelled from this little tumult once their triumph.	I crossed the room and looked out into the night.	At which Liveloose was so extremely amused, the tears stood in his eyes for laughing.	So I too sat down without speech, and waited till he should come up out of his gloom, and find a friend in a stranger.

We read together, rode, walked, and talked together, and listened in the evening to music.	broke in Obstinate again, and snapped his fingers in the air.	They'd bob and crook to me like spaniels at a trencher.	I'm Bottom the weaver, I am.	"Why," answered Superstition, "Cruelty works cunningest when he is afraid; and Liveloose never talks about himself.	Mystery and peril brooded on those distant ravines, the vapours of their far-descending cataracts.	Evidently our departure had not passed unseen.	And I was presently fully persuaded he spoke a kind of English, and that not unpleasingly, with a liquid, shrill, voluminous ease.	I almost doubted my own eyes when I looked upon his yellow, on that unmoved, sad, mad, pale face.	To my mind he is mistaken--too energetic; but his intentions are good."	Here a bottle, a cheese, grapes, a hare, a goblet--in a clear brown light that made the guest's mouth water to admire.	(_Tom o' Bedlam_).	"Good-bye," she replied very gently.	"You must tell your friend, Mr. Reverie," said Atheist good-humouredly, "that Mr. Cruelty says more than he means.	Forgetful of thorn and brier, trickery and wantonness, we clambered down after him, out of the moonlight, into a dark, clear alley, soundless and solitary amid these enchanted woods.	He seemed now so pitiless and unlovely of heart; and now, as if possessed, passionate and swift; and now would break away burning from her arms in an infinite tenderness.	Nature, if I understood him aright.	Nature's, they were so full of what they could not tell.	Here they reclined just as sorcerous sleep had overtaken them.	I would like to be alone.	Your nectar throbbeth like a blacksmith's anvil.	Even as we set out, I leading Rosinante by her bridle, and Superstition on my left hand, out of heavenly Leo a bright star wheeled, fading as it fell.	I have stood here, Mr. Brocken, on darker nights as still as this, and have heard what seemed to be the sea breaking, far away, leagues upon leagues beyond the forests--the gush forward, the protracted, heavy retreat,--listened till I could have wept to think that it was only my own poor furious heart beating.	A chill breeze played over the sea: a shadow crossed my eyes.	As for pose, he whose horse now stood smoking beside my own first drew my attention--a smooth, small-bearded, solemn man, a little beyond his prime.	I can but repeat it, sir, our poor neighbour was crazed: 'tis Christian in a word."	He told me also that if friends he had, he deemed it wiser not to name them, since the least sibilant of the sound of the voice incites to treachery; and in conclusion, that of all men he was acquainted with, one at least never failed to right his humour; and that one was yonder flabby, pallid fellow with the velvet collar to his coat, and the rings on his fingers, and the gold hair, named Pliable, who sat beside Mr. Stubborn on the settle by the fire.	1.E.9.

And was that our poet wrote our poet's only, or truly theirs, and so even more lovely?--I fear I could not tell.	Nay, I would not have missed him for a ransom.	He is but a child, no older than the sea, no stranger than the mountains, pure and cold as the water-springs.
