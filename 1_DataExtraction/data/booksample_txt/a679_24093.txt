"Oh, I see, I see!"	It would do her good.	And you're ten times better looking than you were then, Jim."	Jim's been gone an hour.	"But I shall not be here to see it."	"I had thought of that--but it's dangerous."	Stuart asked, in low tones.	"That's great!"	He looked up and Harriet stood smiling at him.

"There are men in New York who would cut their right arm off rather than do such things."	He looked about the room and saw that he was in the inner office of the president of the bank, alone with Bivens's wife.	The doctor had made up his mind to kill him at the moment the dance was at the highest pitch of gaiety and he wanted to get him as near the great arch as possible.	"No more ducks to-day, Cal," Stuart said briskly, returning to his tone of friendly comradeship.	Your unexpected advent is the sweetest triumph of this festival night.

Nan led the way to the ball room, where the entertainment by hired dancers, singers, and professional entertainers began on an improvised stage.	His enemies saw their opportunity.

He threw off his cook's apron, put on his coat, sprang out of the galley, and called below: "A tender is coming, Nan.	"Dr. Woodman has just received an important letter from him dated here, and he asked my advice about it."	He thrust his delicate hands into his pockets and deliberately looked the doctor's big figure over from head to foot as he approached with embarrassment.

"I really don't know--perhaps the thing that makes the birds out there in the Square chirp while the snow is still on the ground, the feeling that Spring is coming."	Stuart sprang to his feet with an exclamation of horror.	"My God, don't say that, Nan!"	Bivens suddenly drew his watch and spoke with quick nervous energy: "I must call those reporters and get rid of them as soon as possible."	Have common sense.	Deserted and denied by his own disciples, scoffed at, spit on and beaten by his enemies, crucified between two thieves, crying in anguish and despair to the God who had forsaken him; yet this friendless crucified peasant who failed, has conquered the world at last."

Nan cried, pointing to the heights on the left.	The big hand fell in a gesture of despair.	You've come to be like one of us."	What strange pranks Fate plays with the mighty as well as the lowly!	I needn't recall what passed between you and the doctor the night of the ball."	It was amazing, this ignorance of the average New Yorker.	What chance had his old friend Woodman against such forces?
