keen	poignant	agonies	seemed	to	shoot	from	his	neck	downward	through	every	fiber	of	his	body	and	limbs		
how	slowly	it	appeared	to	move		
he	was	a	federal	scout		
at	a	signal	from	the	former	the	latter	would	step	aside	the	plank	would	tilt	and	the	condemned	man	go	down	between	two	ties		
ah	that	was	a	fine	endeavor		
with	their	greater	infrequency	the	sounds	increased	in	strength	and	sharpness		
its	recurrence	was	regular	but	as	slow	as	the	tolling	of	a	death	knell		
farquhar	diveddived	as	deeply	as	he	could		
the	man	in	the	water	saw	the	eye	of	the	man	on	the	bridge	gazing	into	his	own	through	the	sights	of	the	rifle		
they	will	not	do	that	again	he	thought	the	next	time	they	will	use	a	charge	of	grape		
what	a	sluggish	stream		
one	lodged	between	his	collar	and	neck	it	was	uncomfortably	warm	and	he	snatched	it	out		
the	arrangement	commended	itself	to	his	judgement	as	simple	and	effective		
he	felt	the	ripples	upon	his	face	and	heard	their	separate	sounds	as	they	struck		
		
what	he	heard	was	the	ticking	of	his	watch		
a	fish	slid	along	beneath	his	eyes	and	he	heard	the	rush	of	its	body	parting	the	water		
he	watched	them	with	a	new	interest	as	first	one	and	then	the	other	pounced	upon	the	noose	at	his	neck		
he	thought	he	shouted	these	words	to	his	hands	for	the	undoing	of	the	noose	had	been	succeeded	by	the	direst	pang	that	he	had	yet	experienced		
the	cord	fell	away	his	arms	parted	and	floated	upward	the	hands	dimly	seen	on	each	side	in	the	growing	light		
he	looked	at	the	forest	on	the	bank	of	the	stream	saw	the	individual	trees	the	leaves	and	the	veining	of	each	leafhe	saw	the	very	insects	upon	them	 	the	locusts	the	brilliant	bodied	flies	the	gray	spiders	stretching	their	webs	from	twig	to	twig		
only	a	picket	post	half	a	mile	out	on	the	railroad	and	a	single	sentinel	at	this	end	of	the	bridge		
he	opened	his	eyes	in	the	darkness	and	saw	above	him	a	gleam	of	light	but	how	distant	how	inaccessible		
		
farquhar	asked		
the	intellectual	part	of	his	nature	was	already	effaced	he	had	power	only	to	feel	and	feeling	was	torment		
the	yanks	are	repairing	the	railroads	said	the	man	and	are	getting	ready	for	another	advance		
an	appalling	splash	within	two	yards	of	him	was	followed	by	a	loud	rushing	sound	diminuendo	which	seemed	to	travel	back	through	the	air	to	the	fort	and	died	in	an	explosion	which	stirred	the	very	river	to	its	deeps		
		
meanwhile	he	did	what	he	could		
the	liberal	military	code	makes	provision	for	hanging	many	kinds	of	persons	and	gentlemen	are	not	excluded		
the	commandant	has	issued	an	order	which	is	posted	everywhere	declaring	that	any	civilian	caught	interfering	with	the	railroad	its	bridges	tunnels	or	trains	will	be	summarily	hanged		
the	water	the	banks	the	forests	the	now	distant	bridge	fort	and	men	all	were	commingled	and	blurred		
the	lady	had	now	brought	the	water	which	the	soldier	drank		
they	seemed	like	streams	of	pulsating	fire	heating	him	to	an	intolerable	temperature		
what	splendid	effort!what	magnificent	what	superhuman	strength		
this	plank	had	been	held	in	place	by	the	weight	of	the	captain	it	was	now	held	by	that	of	the	sergeant		
mrs.	farquhar	was	only	too	happy	to	serve	him	with	her	own	white	hands		
		
he	wore	a	moustache	and	pointed	beard	but	no	whiskers	his	eyes	were	large	and	dark	gray	and	had	a	kindly	expression	which	one	would	hardly	have	expected	in	one	whose	neck	was	in	the	hemp		
put	it	back	put	it	back		
suppose	a	mana	civilian	and	student	of	hangingshould	elude	the	picket	post	and	perhaps	get	the	better	of	the	sentinel	said	farquhar	smiling	what	could	he	accomplish		
while	she	was	fetching	the	water	her	husband	approached	the	dusty	horseman	and	inquired	eagerly	for	news	from	the	front		
suddenly	he	felt	himself	whirled	round	and	roundspinning	like	a	top		
they	were	in	silhouette	against	the	blue	sky		
he	dug	his	fingers	into	the	sand	threw	it	over	himself	in	handfuls	and	audibly	blessed	it		
he	closed	his	eyes	in	order	to	fix	his	last	thoughts	upon	his	wife	and	children		
the	end	upon	which	the	civilian	stood	almost	but	not	quite	reached	a	fourth		
ii	peyton	farquhar	was	a	well	to	do	planter	of	an	old	and	highly	respected	alabama	family		
to	be	hanged	and	drowned	he	thought	that	is	not	so	bad	but	i	do	not	wish	to	be	shot		
being	a	slave	owner	and	like	other	slave	owners	a	politician	he	was	naturally	an	original	secessionist	and	ardently	devoted	to	the	southern	cause		
one	evening	while	farquhar	and	his	wife	were	sitting	on	a	rustic	bench	near	the	entrance	to	his	grounds	a	grayclad	soldier	rode	up	to	the	gate	and	asked	for	a	drink	of	water		
there	was	something	uncanny	in	the	revelation		
attention		
		
encompassed	in	a	luminous	cloud	of	which	he	was	now	merely	the	fiery	heart	without	material	substance	he	swung	through	unthinkable	arcs	of	oscillation	like	a	vast	pendulum		
he	had	come	to	the	surface	facing	down	the	stream	in	a	moment	the	visible	world	seemed	to	wheel	slowly	round	himself	the	pivotal	point	and	he	saw	the	bridge	the	fort	the	soldiers	upon	the	bridge	the	captain	the	sergeant	the	two	privates	his	executioners		
they	were	indeed	preternaturally	keen	and	alert		
striking	through	the	thought	of	his	dear	ones	was	sound	which	he	could	neither	ignore	nor	understand	a	sharp	distinct	metallic	percussion	like	the	stroke	of	a	blacksmith	's	hammer	upon	the	anvil	it	had	the	same	ringing	quality		
something	in	the	awful	disturbance	of	his	organic	system	had	so	exalted	and	refined	them	that	they	made	record	of	things	never	before	perceived		
		
to	die	of	hanging	at	the	bottom	of	a	river!the	idea	seemed	to	him	ludicrous		
		
as	to	his	head	he	was	conscious	of	nothing	but	a	feeling	of	fullnessof	congestion		
as	he	shook	his	head	free	from	the	commotion	of	the	smitten	water	he	heard	the	deflected	shot	humming	through	the	air	ahead	and	in	an	instant	it	was	cracking	and	smashing	the	branches	in	the	forest	beyond		
he	heard	a	second	report	and	saw	one	of	the	sentinels	with	his	rifle	at	his	shoulder	a	light	cloud	of	blue	smoke	rising	from	the	muzzle		
		
		
		
that	is	a	good	gun		
circumstances	of	an	imperious	nature	which	it	is	unnecessary	to	relate	here	had	prevented	him	from	taking	service	with	that	gallant	army	which	had	fought	the	disastrous	campaigns	ending	with	the	fall	of	corinth	and	he	chafed	under	the	inglorious	restraint	longing	for	the	release	of	his	energies	the	larger	life	of	the	soldier	the	opportunity	for	distinction		
they	beat	the	water	vigorously	with	quick	downward	strokes	forcing	him	to	the	surface		
the	thought	of	his	wife	and	children	urged	him	on		
his	whole	body	was	racked	and	wrenched	with	an	insupportable	anguish		
it	is	now	dry	and	would	burn	like	tinder		
i	was	there	a	month	ago	he	replied		
if	i	could	free	my	hands	he	thought	i	might	throw	off	the	noose	and	spring	into	the	stream		
the	trees	upon	the	bank	were	giant	garden	plants	he	noted	a	definite	order	in	their	arrangement	inhaled	the	fragrance	of	their	blooms		
		
		
he	noted	the	prismatic	colors	in	all	the	dewdrops	upon	a	million	blades	of	grass		
objects	were	represented	by	their	colors	only	circular	horizontal	streaks	of	colorthat	was	all	he	saw		
the	soldiers	had	almost	finished	reloading	the	metal	ramrods	flashed	all	at	once	in	the	sunshine	as	they	were	drawn	from	the	barrels	turned	in	the	air	and	thrust	into	their	sockets		
the	kangaroo	said	i	do	so	enjoy	that	great	man	's	censure	of	the	ridiculousparticularly	his	attacks	on	the	proboscidae	but	alas		
how	unsatisfying	its	rewards		
three	of	a	kind	a	lawyer	in	whom	an	instinct	of	justice	had	survived	the	wreck	of	his	ignorance	of	law	was	retained	for	the	defence	of	a	burglar	whom	the	police	had	taken	after	a	desperate	struggle	with	someone	not	in	custody		
lions	have	a	superstitious	terror	of	my	voice	answered	the	cock	proudly		
so	as	to	be	there	in	time	to	get	the	country	that	he	saved

my	friend	said	the	office	seeker	you	see	before	you	the	wreck	of	an	ambitious	manruined	by	the	pursuit	of	place	and	power		
at	this	point	in	the	proceedings	they	were	interrupted	by	the	sound	of	a	brass	band		
will	what	i	say	make	any	difference		
after	some	years	when	all	but	one	had	had	judgment	given	against	them	that	one	was	awarded	the	estate	which	he	asked	his	attorney	to	have	appraised
