and	at	that	thinking	a	host	of	evil	things	to	be	upon	us	i	cried	out	to	the	bo'sun	and	the	men	to	awake		
and	at	that	the	bo'sun	cried	out	suddenly	that	he	knew	though	of	what	it	was	that	he	knew	i	had	at	that	time	no	knowledge		
thus	we	heard	a	sound	which	had	escaped	us	in	the	noise	of	the	growling	without	the	vessel	and	the	interest	of	the	reading		
this	when	they	brought	it	he	bade	me	heat	in	the	fire	and	afterwards	beat	out	straight	at	one	end	and	when	this	was	done	he	set	me	to	burn	holes	with	it	through	the	keel	of	the	boat	at	such	places	as	he	had	marked	these	being	for	the	bolts	with	which	he	had	determined	to	fasten	on	the	batten		
having	now	completed	a	sufficiency	of	the	line	the	bo'sun	set	one	of	the	men	to	flake	it	down	very	carefully	upon	the	rock	beside	the	bow	whilst	he	himself	tested	it	at	all	such	parts	as	he	thought	in	any	way	doubtful	and	so	presently	all	was	ready		
i	looked	now	to	where	the	brown	thing	had	been	for	the	boat	had	moved	a	few	fathoms	from	the	spot	having	got	some	way	upon	her	before	the	oar	was	snatched	and	thus	i	discovered	that	the	monster	had	disappeared	having	i	conceived	sunk	again	into	the	depths	from	which	it	had	risen	yet	it	might	reappear	at	any	moment	and	in	that	case	the	boy	would	be	taken	before	our	eyes		
and	after	the	tent	was	up	he	set	them	to	carry	the	dry	weed	to	the	new	camp	and	at	this	he	kept	them	until	near	dusk	for	he	had	vowed	never	again	to	be	without	a	sufficiency	of	fuel		
and	then	i	had	the	steeringoar	by	the	middle	and	was	smiting	downward	with	the	loom	over	the	side	of	the	boat	but	the	thing	was	gone	from	my	sight		
at	that	i	waved	my	hand	to	him	in	friendly	fashion	and	he	waved	back	and	then	even	as	i	looked	i	saw	something	in	the	water	under	the	boatsomething	dark	colored	that	was	all	of	amove		
to	this	end	the	bo'sun	sent	two	of	the	men	across	the	island	to	gather	some	of	the	dry	seaweed	for	we	intended	to	cook	some	of	the	salt	meat	this	being	the	first	cooked	meal	since	ending	the	meat	which	we	had	boiled	before	leaving	the	ship	in	the	creek		
and	so	i	settled	down	to	pass	the	time	ere	i	should	be	allowed	to	sleep	but	first	i	asked	the	man	whom	i	had	relieved	how	long	a	time	had	passed	since	moonrise	to	which	he	replied	that	it	was	no	more	than	the	half	of	an	hour	and	after	that	i	questioned	whether	he	had	seen	aught	strange	amid	the	weed	during	his	time	at	the	oar	but	he	had	seen	nothing	except	that	once	he	had	fancied	a	light	had	shown	in	the	midst	of	the	waste	yet	it	could	have	been	naught	save	a	humor	of	the	imagination	though	apart	from	this	he	had	heard	a	strange	crying	a	little	after	midnight	and	twice	there	had	been	great	splashes	among	the	weed		
at	that	the	bo'sun	seized	an	oar	and	i	did	likewise	and	so	swiftly	as	we	dared	for	fear	of	making	any	unneedful	noise	we	pulled	the	boat	to	a	safer	distance		
and	so	in	a	little	being	now	most	comfortably	armed	we	made	inland	towards	the	nearer	black	hill	in	very	good	spirits		
at	this	meal	as	might	be	supposed	we	had	a	second	discussion	upon	the	strangeness	of	the	behavior	of	those	aboard	the	hulk	yet	none	could	give	any	more	reasonable	explanation	than	the	bo'sun	had	given	in	the	morning	and	so	we	left	it	at	that		
as	each	huge	sea	came	towards	us	the	boat	shot	up	to	meet	it	right	up	to	its	very	crest	and	there	for	the	space	of	some	instants	we	would	seem	to	be	swamped	in	a	very	ocean	of	foam	boiling	up	on	each	side	of	the	boat	to	the	height	of	many	feet		
at	this	sight	some	of	the	men	cried	out	their	astonishment	and	then	we	saw	that	there	had	come	a	number	of	men	into	the	lookout	place	in	the	top	of	the	superstructure	and	immediately	they	opened	a	very	brisk	fire	upon	the	creatures	and	so	by	ones	and	twos	they	fell	back	into	the	weed	and	after	that	the	men	in	the	hulk	resumed	their	heaving	and	so	in	a	while	had	the	rope	some	feet	clear	of	the	surface		
but	first	he	had	us	all	back	to	the	beach	to	give	a	hand	to	turn	over	the	boat	so	that	he	might	get	to	the	damaged	part		
here	whilst	some	stretched	the	canvas	nailing	its	lower	edges	to	the	gunnels	others	were	employed	in	lashing	together	the	oars	and	the	mast	and	to	this	bundle	they	secured	a	considerable	length	of	new	threeandahalfinch	hemp	rope	which	we	had	brought	away	from	the	hulk	along	with	the	canvas		
the	bo'sun	was	the	first	man	to	reach	the	bottom	of	the	cleft	and	he	set	off	immediately	round	the	base	of	the	rock	to	the	beach	the	rest	of	us	following	him	as	we	made	safe	our	footing	in	the	valley		
now	the	bo'sun	so	soon	as	he	saw	the	thing	ran	forward	to	the	brow	of	the	hill	and	placing	his	hands	to	his	mouth	after	the	fashion	of	a	trumpet	sang	out	to	the	boy	to	bring	the	boat	to	the	shore	and	make	fast	the	painter	to	a	large	piece	of	rock		
here	i	paced	up	and	down	awhile	smoking	and	meditating		
now	since	the	creature	had	so	nearly	captured	the	bo'sun	it	had	ceased	to	tug	at	the	boat	and	lay	silent	with	its	tentacles	spread	all	about	it	and	its	great	eyes	appearing	just	over	the	stern	so	that	it	presented	an	appearance	of	watching	our	movements	though	i	doubt	if	it	saw	us	with	any	clearness	for	it	must	have	been	dazed	with	the	brightness	of	the	sunshine		
when	these	were	upset	upon	the	rock	i	was	confounded	to	perceive	the	length	and	thickness	of	some	of	them	and	could	only	conceive	that	this	particular	fish	must	be	a	very	desperate	enemy	to	them	and	able	successfully	to	attack	monsters	of	a	bulk	infinitely	greater	than	its	own		
and	so	through	the	afternoon	we	sat	about	upon	the	crest	of	the	hill	overlooking	the	hulk	and	thrice	had	they	in	the	ship	to	heave	upon	the	big	rope	and	by	evening	they	had	made	near	thirty	fathoms	towards	the	island	the	which	they	told	us	in	reply	to	a	query	which	the	bo'sun	desired	me	to	send	them	several	messages	having	passed	between	us	in	the	course	of	the	afternoon	so	that	we	had	the	carrier	upon	our	side		
from	now	until	the	dawn	the	bo'sun	remained	awake	with	me	and	we	talked	much	upon	that	which	we	had	seen	yet	could	come	to	no	satisfactory	conclusion	for	it	seemed	impossible	to	us	that	a	place	of	so	much	desolation	could	contain	any	living	being		
and	so	at	last	being	wearied	with	watching	we	made	it	up	together	to	shout	when	the	bo'sun	should	give	us	the	signal	by	this	means	making	a	good	volume	of	sound	which	we	conceived	the	wind	might	carry	down	to	the	vessel		
and	so	i	got	at	last	a	very	substantial	little	spell	of	sleep	which	made	me	fit	enough	for	the	day	's	work		
now	the	stumbling	of	the	man	over	me	my	awakening	and	the	discovery	that	my	face	and	throat	were	beslimed	were	but	the	happenings	of	some	few	short	instants	and	then	i	was	upon	my	feet	and	following	him	round	to	the	fire	for	i	had	a	sense	of	chilliness	and	a	great	desire	not	to	be	alone		
and	so	i	faced	outwards	looking	to	see	if	any	vile	face	showed	above	the	edge	before	me	or	to	my	right	or	left		
yet	as	it	was	i	suffered	a	mighty	peril	for	the	brute	that	had	my	foot	put	a	vast	strain	upon	it	trying	to	pull	me	down	but	i	resisted	using	my	hands	and	seat	to	sustain	me	and	so	discovering	that	it	could	not	compass	my	end	in	this	wise	it	slacked	somewhat	of	the	stress	and	bit	at	my	boot	shearing	through	the	hard	leather	and	nigh	destroying	my	small	toe	but	now	being	no	longer	compelled	to	use	both	hands	to	retain	my	position	i	slashed	down	with	great	fury	being	maddened	by	the	pain	and	the	mortal	fear	which	the	creature	had	put	upon	me	yet	i	was	not	immediately	free	of	the	brute	for	it	caught	my	sword	blade	but	i	snatched	it	away	before	it	could	take	a	proper	hold	mayhaps	cutting	its	feelers	somewhat	thereby	though	of	this	i	can	not	be	sure	for	they	seemed	not	to	grip	around	a	thing	but	to	suck	to	it	then	in	a	moment	by	a	lucky	blow	i	maimed	it	so	that	it	loosed	me	and	i	was	able	to	get	back	into	some	condition	of	security		
but	now	doubtless	because	of	the	weight	of	the	line	it	made	nowhere	near	so	good	a	flight	as	on	the	previous	occasion	the	arrow	striking	the	weed	some	two	hundred	yards	short	of	the	hulk	and	at	this	i	could	near	have	wept	with	vexation	and	disappointment		
now	in	about	two	hours	i	had	made	my	arrow	the	bo'sun	having	finished	his	a	little	earlier	and	so	the	men	having	hauled	in	all	the	line	and	flaked	it	down	ready	we	prepared	to	make	another	attempt	to	cast	it	over	the	hulk		
and	so	presently	we	went	to	breakfast	eating	heartily	our	night	of	wakefulness	having	given	us	mighty	appetites	but	for	all	that	we	were	so	engrossed	by	the	mystery	of	the	lonesome	craft	that	i	doubt	if	any	of	us	knew	what	manner	of	food	it	was	with	which	we	filled	our	bellies		
at	that	i	cried	out	that	i	did	not	know	and	presently	being	somewhat	calmer	i	told	them	of	the	thing	that	i	had	seen	but	even	as	i	told	of	it	there	seemed	to	be	no	truth	in	it	so	that	they	were	all	at	a	loss	to	know	whether	i	had	fallen	asleep	or	that	i	had	indeed	seen	a	devil		
for	some	minutes	we	waited	to	make	sure	that	the	monster	had	indeed	gone	and	after	that	we	hastened	to	the	boat	and	drew	her	up	so	far	as	we	were	able	after	which	we	unloaded	the	heaviest	of	her	contents	and	so	were	able	to	get	her	right	clear	of	the	water		
presently	the	bo'sun	called	out	to	me	that	he	had	got	the	surface	of	the	stock	sufficiently	smooth	and	nice	and	at	that	i	went	over	to	him	for	now	i	wished	him	to	burn	a	slight	groove	down	the	center	running	from	end	to	end	and	this	i	desired	to	be	done	very	exactly	for	upon	it	depended	much	of	the	true	flight	of	the	arrow		
and	so	presently	being	determined	to	give	way	to	no	fancifulness	i	avoided	the	boundary	of	cliffs	and	kept	more	to	that	part	which	commanded	the	slope	up	and	down	which	we	made	our	journeys	to	and	from	the	island	below		
but	first	before	we	left	the	camp	the	bo'sun	gave	us	all	a	very	sound	tot	of	the	rum	and	also	a	biscuit	apiece	and	thereafter	we	hasted	down	each	man	holding	his	weapon	readily		
and	so	it	may	be	seen	how	very	great	and	genuine	was	our	exaltation	upon	our	discovery	of	these	poor	people	shut	off	from	the	world	within	that	lonesome	craft		
i	could	see	it	but	dimly	catching	odd	glimpses	of	it	as	the	surface	of	the	water	smoothed	at	whiles		
but	the	bo'sun	turned	upon	him	with	a	very	great	anger	for	in	throwing	his	weapon	the	man	had	left	himself	without	and	thus	brought	danger	to	the	whole	yet	as	will	be	remembered	i	had	done	likewise	but	a	little	since		
and	beyond	this	i	could	make	out	but	little	because	of	the	distance	though	the	sun	which	was	upon	our	larboard	side	gave	me	some	sight	of	her	hull	but	not	much	because	of	the	weed	in	which	she	was	deeply	embedded	yet	it	seemed	to	me	that	her	sides	were	very	weatherworn	and	in	one	place	some	glistening	brown	object	which	may	have	been	a	fungus	caught	the	rays	of	the	sun	sending	off	a	wet	sheen		
this	find	i	pointed	out	to	the	bo'sun	remarking	that	it	might	prove	of	use	for	firing	but	he	smiled	at	me	telling	me	that	the	dried	weed	would	make	a	very	abundant	fire	and	this	without	going	to	the	labor	of	cutting	the	mast	into	suitable	logs		
anon	i	would	stare	out	across	the	immensity	of	the	vast	continent	of	weed	and	slime	that	stretched	its	incredible	desolation	out	beyond	the	darkening	horizon	and	there	would	come	the	thought	to	me	of	the	terror	of	men	whose	vessels	had	been	entangled	among	its	strange	growths	and	so	my	thoughts	came	to	the	lone	derelict	that	lay	out	there	in	the	dusk	and	i	fell	to	wondering	what	had	been	the	end	of	her	people	and	at	that	i	grew	yet	more	solemn	in	my	heart		
and	then	we	were	in	the	great	creek	up	which	we	had	come	and	so	in	a	little	it	was	night		
and	this	we	did	though	all	in	a	disconsolate	condition	of	mind	for	we	had	seemed	so	near	to	success	and	now	it	appeared	to	be	further	than	ever	from	us		
further	than	this	they	explained	that	they	would	tend	the	rope	during	the	night	so	that	the	strain	would	be	kept	up	and	more	this	would	keep	the	ropes	off	the	weed		
now	a	while	before	the	dawn	we	discovered	for	the	second	time	since	we	had	been	upon	the	island	that	our	fuel	could	not	last	us	the	night	at	the	rate	at	which	we	were	compelled	to	burn	it	and	so	the	bo'sun	told	the	men	to	let	out	every	second	fire	and	thus	we	staved	off	for	a	while	the	time	when	we	should	have	to	face	a	spell	of	darkness	and	the	things	which	at	present	the	fires	held	off	from	us		
thus	we	each	of	us	stared	down	upon	a	most	unearthly	sight	for	the	valley	all	beneath	us	was	aswarm	with	moving	creatures	white	and	unwholesome	in	the	moonlight	and	their	movements	were	somewhat	like	the	movements	of	monstrous	slugs	though	the	things	themselves	had	no	resemblance	to	such	in	their	contours	but	minded	me	of	naked	humans	very	fleshy	and	crawling	upon	their	stomachs	yet	their	movements	lacked	not	a	surprising	rapidity		
by	the	time	we	had	raced	up	to	the	men	the	one	who	had	stumbled	was	again	upon	his	feet	and	turning	to	assist	his	comrade	but	the	bo'sun	snatched	his	spear	from	him	and	leapt	forward	himself	for	the	crab	was	making	now	at	the	other	man		
then	having	made	an	end	of	writing	he	bade	two	of	the	men	take	hold	of	the	canvas	by	the	ends	and	expose	it	to	the	view	of	those	in	the	ship	and	in	this	manner	we	got	them	to	understand	our	desires		
it	was	a	little	before	the	evening	came	down	upon	the	island	that	the	bo'sun	ceased	work	and	after	that	he	called	to	the	men	who	having	made	an	end	of	their	fuel	carrying	were	standing	near	to	place	the	full	breakerswhich	we	had	not	thought	needful	to	carry	to	the	new	camp	on	account	of	their	weightunder	the	upturned	boat	some	holding	up	the	gunnel	whilst	the	others	pushed	them	under		
now	the	men	so	soon	as	they	perceived	my	intention	applauded	me	very	heartily	desiring	to	follow	but	the	bo'sun	bade	them	be	silent	and	after	that	he	lashed	me	into	the	chair	with	his	own	hands	and	then	signaled	to	those	in	the	ship	to	haul	upon	the	small	rope	he	in	the	meanwhile	checking	my	descent	towards	the	weeds	by	means	of	our	end	of	the	haulingline		
presently	maybe	the	half	of	an	hour	afterwards	they	signaled	to	us	to	haul	upon	our	line	which	we	proceeded	to	do	without	delay	and	so	after	a	great	space	we	had	hauled	in	all	of	our	rough	line	and	come	upon	the	end	of	theirs	which	proved	to	be	a	fine	piece	of	threeinch	hemp	new	and	very	good	yet	we	could	not	conceive	that	this	would	stand	the	stress	necessary	to	lift	so	great	a	length	clear	of	the	weed	as	would	be	needful	or	ever	we	could	hope	to	bring	the	people	of	the	ship	over	it	in	safety		
here	i	came	abruptly	upon	three	great	shapes	moving	with	stealthiness	towards	the	camp	and	behind	these	i	saw	dimly	that	there	were	others		
in	the	end	i	made	a	very	fair	one	feathering	it	with	its	own	leaves	and	truing	and	smoothing	it	with	my	knife	after	which	i	inserted	a	small	bolt	in	the	forrard	end	to	act	as	a	head	and	as	i	conceived	give	it	balance	though	whether	i	was	right	in	this	latter	i	am	unable	to	say		
it	may	be	conceived	with	truth	that	the	above	happenings	had	put	a	very	considerable	strain	upon	my	nerves	so	that	i	looked	to	and	fro	continually	with	ever	and	anon	a	quick	glance	behind	me	for	it	seemed	to	me	that	i	might	expect	some	demoniac	creature	to	rush	upon	me	at	any	moment		
and	indeed	it	was	speedily	evident	that	the	boat	would	need	some	attention	for	the	plank	in	her	bottom	next	but	one	to	the	keel	upon	the	starboard	side	had	been	burst	inwards	this	having	been	done	it	would	seem	by	some	rock	in	the	beach	hidden	just	beneath	the	water	's	edge	the	devilfish	having	no	doubt	ground	the	boat	down	upon	it		
so	soon	as	we	had	made	our	breakfast	the	bo'sun	took	us	all	down	to	the	carrying	of	fuel	for	he	saw	very	clearly	that	upon	a	good	supply	of	this	depended	our	immunity	from	attack		
i	saw	the	face	come	up	towards	me	and	one	misshapen	hand	fluttered	almost	to	my	throat	and	there	came	a	sudden	hateful	reek	in	my	nostrilsfoul	and	abominable		
to	this	end	we	went	down	all	of	us	to	the	beach	where	lay	the	wreckage	and	getting	about	the	portion	which	i	intended	to	use	carried	it	to	the	foot	of	the	hill	then	we	sent	a	man	to	the	top	to	let	down	the	rope	by	which	we	had	moored	the	boat	to	the	sea	anchor	and	when	we	had	bent	this	on	securely	to	the	piece	of	timber	we	returned	to	the	hilltop	and	tailed	on	to	the	rope	and	so	presently	after	much	weariful	pulling	had	it	up		
presently	relieving	each	other	frequently	we	completed	the	second	cut	and	after	that	the	bo'sun	set	us	to	saw	a	block	about	twelve	inches	deep	from	the	remaining	portion	of	the	topmast		
in	this	wise	i	perceived	that	the	thing	which	had	attracted	my	notice	was	the	dead	body	of	one	of	the	weed	men		
then	i	took	a	dozen	reeds	and	cut	them	each	to	a	length	of	twentyfive	feet	and	afterwards	notched	them	for	the	strings		
now	in	addition	to	the	matters	for	the	healing	of	our	wounds	and	the	letter	they	had	included	a	bundle	of	paper	in	loose	sheets	some	quills	and	an	inkhorn	and	at	the	end	of	their	epistle	they	begged	very	earnestly	of	us	to	send	them	some	news	of	the	outer	world	for	they	had	been	shut	up	in	that	strange	continent	of	weed	for	something	over	seven	years		
and	at	that	i	ran	towards	the	place	uttering	a	shout	and	waving	my	cutandthrust	yet	i	found	nothing	and	so	feeling	somewhat	foolish	i	turned	to	make	up	the	fire	as	had	been	my	intention	and	whilst	i	was	thus	busied	the	bo'sun	came	running	over	to	me	to	know	what	i	had	seen	and	in	the	same	instant	there	ran	three	of	the	men	out	of	the	tent	all	of	them	waked	by	my	sudden	cry		
upon	this	we	came	to	a	greater	horror	of	the	weed	men	than	ever	for	we	knew	them	now	to	be	foul	ghouls	who	could	not	let	even	the	dead	body	rest	in	the	grave		
now	hearing	the	man	say	that	his	kite	would	fly	without	a	tail	i	was	mightily	curious	to	see	what	manner	of	thing	he	would	make	for	i	had	never	seen	the	like	nor	heard	that	such	was	possible		
and	at	the	end	of	the	meal	he	served	out	to	us	each	a	little	of	the	molasses	which	we	mixed	with	hot	water	and	drank		
then	when	we	had	made	an	end	of	dining	the	bo'sun	sent	josh	with	four	of	the	men	up	stream	perchance	after	a	mile	or	two	the	water	should	prove	of	sufficient	freshness	to	meet	our	purpose		
this	did	we	and	made	out	presently	that	we	were	hauling	something	across	the	weed	of	a	very	fair	bulk	at	which	we	warmed	to	our	work	guessing	that	it	was	the	bread	which	they	had	promised	us	and	so	it	proved	and	done	up	with	great	neatness	in	a	long	roll	of	tarpaulin	which	had	been	wrapped	around	both	the	loaves	and	the	rope	and	lashed	very	securely	at	the	ends	thus	producing	a	taper	shape	convenient	for	passing	over	the	weed	without	catching		
at	this	i	threw	yet	more	fuel	upon	the	fire	and	after	that	i	fixed	my	gaze	in	the	direction	of	the	valley	thus	in	the	following	instant	it	seemed	to	me	that	i	saw	a	certain	thing	as	it	might	be	a	shadow	move	on	the	outer	borders	of	the	firelight		
and	so	i	came	back	to	the	fire	and	presently	it	not	being	my	time	to	watch	until	after	midnight	i	turned	into	the	tent	for	a	spell	of	sleep	having	first	arranged	a	comfortable	spread	of	some	of	the	softer	portions	of	the	dry	weed	to	make	me	a	bed		
and	whilst	he	was	still	pondering	the	matter	i	raised	myself	and	took	a	look	on	all	sides	of	us	and	so	i	discovered	that	there	lay	another	great	bank	upon	our	larboard	side	and	this	i	pointed	out	to	him		
when	the	fires	had	been	got	going	we	put	on	the	boiler	and	treated	the	great	crab	as	i	have	already	mentioned	and	so	fellto	upon	a	very	hearty	supper	but	as	we	ate	each	man	had	his	weapon	stuck	in	the	sand	beside	him	for	we	had	knowledge	that	the	valley	held	some	devilish	thing	or	maybe	many	though	the	knowing	did	not	spoil	our	appetites		
with	these	we	returned	once	more	to	the	camp	and	there	i	setto	and	trimmed	them	of	their	leaves	keeping	these	latter	for	i	had	a	use	for	them		
now	though	the	ground	was	very	soft	there	was	in	it	so	much	of	springiness	that	it	left	no	trace	of	our	steps	after	we	had	gone	on	a	little	way	none	that	is	save	that	in	odd	places	a	wet	patch	followed	upon	our	treading		
but	it	seemed	too	good	a	thing	to	have	come	true	and	yet	i	could	but	hope		
vii	the	island	in	the	weed	it	was	as	we	were	all	discussing	the	matter	of	the	devil	face	that	had	peered	up	at	me	out	of	the	water	that	job	the	ordinary	seaman	discovered	the	island	in	the	light	of	the	growing	dawn	and	seeing	it	sprang	to	his	feet	with	so	loud	a	cry	that	we	were	like	for	the	moment	to	have	thought	he	had	seen	a	second	demon		
now	the	bo'sun	headed	one	party	and	set	the	big	seaman	over	the	other	bidding	all	to	keep	their	weapons	very	handy		
iv	the	two	faces	of	the	remainder	of	that	night	i	have	but	a	confused	memory		
he	was	especially	anxious	for	haste	in	that	the	sun	had	come	out	again	for	he	was	feared	that	such	small	pools	as	we	should	find	would	be	speedily	dried	up	by	its	heat		
now	presently	we	made	our	dinner	and	after	that	for	the	rest	of	the	day	we	kept	very	steadily	to	our	plaiting	and	so	with	the	previous	day	's	work	had	near	two	hundred	fathoms	completed	by	the	time	that	the	bo'sun	called	us	to	cease	and	come	to	supper		
he	would	tell	us	all	about	it	later		
a	queer	sickening	thrill	went	through	me	and	i	felt	all	the	men	about	me	stiffen	and	go	rigid	with	intensity		
by	the	time	that	this	was	done	the	policemen	had	unloaded	the	donkeys	and	were	waiting	looking	about	them	curiously		
he	heard	her	call	something	in	reply	from	the	boudoir	and	then	he	had	struck	a	clump	of	a	dozen	or	so	matches	and	was	holding	them	above	his	head	and	looking	round	the	hall		
i	was	fighting	with	all	my	strength	to	get	back	my	courage		
some	was	spilled	but	because	of	my	suspicious	watchfulness	i	had	it	upright	and	back	within	the	vale	while	yet	some	of	the	water	remained		
i	asked	whether	everything	was	right	to	which	he	replied	yes	and	immediately	asked	me	whether	i	had	heard	the	galloping	so	that	i	knew	he	had	heard	them	also		
then	i	went	up	to	my	mother	's	room	again	and	we	talked	the	thing	over	for	an	hour	or	more	and	in	the	end	came	to	the	conclusion	that	we	might	after	all	be	reading	too	much	into	a	number	of	little	things	but	you	know	inside	of	us	we	did	not	believe	this		
it	was	a	queer	idea	i	know	and	probably	was	not	my	own	but	came	to	me	from	the	outside		
he	pictured	to	me	the	whole	affairbellett	up	at	the	chancel	gate	going	for	the	prayer	book	and	absolutely	alone	and	then	the	blow	out	of	the	void	he	described	it	and	the	force	prodigiousthe	old	man	being	driven	headlong	into	the	body	of	the	chapel		
all	the	covering	's	were	being	drawn	steadily	off	with	a	hateful	stealthy	sort	of	motion		
and	immediately	afterward	the	clungk	clunkclungk	clunk	of	mighty	hoofs	coming	down	the	passage	toward	us		
i	know	it	was	only	sheer	will	power	that	carried	me	up	to	the	door	and	made	me	turn	the	key		
but	as	i	have	said	i	found	nothing		
each	of	these	girls	grew	up	to	maidenhood	and	each	became	engaged	and	each	one	died	during	the	period	of	engagement	two	by	suicide	one	by	falling	from	a	window	one	from	a	broken	heart	presumably	heart	failure	owing	to	sudden	shock	through	fright		
i	had	hung	a	protection	belt	of	garlic	round	my	neck	and	the	smell	of	it	seemed	to	fill	the	corridor	and	give	me	assurance	for	as	you	all	know	it	is	a	wonderful	protection	against	the	more	usual	aeiirii	forms	of	semimaterialization	by	which	i	supposed	the	whistling	might	be	produced	though	at	that	period	of	my	investigation	i	was	quite	prepared	to	find	it	due	to	some	perfectly	natural	cause	for	it	is	astonishing	the	enormous	number	of	cases	that	prove	to	have	nothing	abnormal	in	them		
a	little	way	off	there	showed	high	up	in	the	gloom	the	vaguely	shining	outline	of	the	other	fork	so	i	knew	the	inspector	had	it	raised	in	his	hand	ready		
i	knew	that	it	might	very	possibly	have	snapped	through	my	having	tensioned	it	too	highly	but	then	again	it	might	have	been	broken	by	something	else		
then	i	had	a	cup	of	coffee	and	went	off	to	my	room	telling	him	i	was	feeling	awfully	tired		
another	big	hand	came	into	view	and	wiped	the	water	from	the	eyes	which	blinked	rapidly	and	then	fixed	themselves	into	a	stare	at	the	lights		
this	was	the	whole	story	so	he	gave	me	to	understand		
this	is	supposing	we	take	the	suggestion	of	the	sigsand	ms	to	account	for	the	phenomenon		
in	less	than	a	minute	they	heard	it	quite	close	to	them	in	the	darkness	and	they	started	running		
in	the	course	of	his	talk	captain	tobias	offered	to	take	the	house	off	my	hands	and	as	this	suited	me	perfectly	for	i	was	about	stalled	with	it	and	the	plan	also	suited	the	landlord	it	was	decided	that	no	steps	should	be	taken	against	him	and	that	the	whole	business	should	be	hushed	up		
i	took	the	dark	slide	into	burtontree	also	the	cake	of	soap	with	the	impress		
at	last	when	the	dawn	was	strong	and	bright	i	took	one	last	look	round	and	ran	for	the	door		
is	n't	it		
that	's	that	blessed	ghost		
not	one	of	us	ever	willingly	missed	for	after	a	thoroughly	sensible	little	dinner	carnacki	would	snuggle	down	into	his	big	armchair	light	his	pipe	and	wait	whilst	we	arranged	ourselves	comfortably	in	our	accustomed	seats	and	nooks		
we	're	all	carrying	guns	said	the	boy	and	slapped	his	coat	pocket		
if	we	had	not	heard	those	last	sounds	and	if	parsket	had	not	shown	that	enormous	sense	of	fear	the	whole	of	this	case	could	be	explained	in	the	way	in	which	i	have	shown		
the	landlord	and	i	locked	up	the	house	and	went	over	to	his	place	for	a	sleep		
some	invisible	thing	was	meddling	with	it		
after	lunch	i	thought	i	would	take	a	few	experimental	photographs	of	miss	hisgins	and	her	surroundings		
and	you	know	i	had	run	her	bang	into	that	danger		
in	the	same	moment	parsket	pitched	forward	out	of	the	doorway	on	to	his	face		
in	the	same	moment	of	time	the	whistling	had	burst	into	a	mad	screaming	note	that	seemed	to	stun	me	even	where	i	stood	outside	of	the	window		
he	said	in	friendly	fashion	using	the	recognized	formula		
i	was	glad	for	i	wanted	the	house	to	settle	as	soon	as	possible		
of	course	that	must	have	been	fancy		
i	glanced	once	at	wentworth		
i	said	nothing	about	the	smell	which	was	not	very	distinct	but	told	her	that	the	thing	happening	twice	had	made	me	a	bit	nervous	and	possibly	fanciful	and	i	thought	i	would	take	a	look	round	just	to	feel	satisfied		
the	fire	was	big	and	cheerful	and	the	candles	before	the	two	rows	of	doors	burnt	steadily	as	well	as	the	solitary	ones	in	the	corners		
as	johnstone	came	up	to	the	door	the	policeman	made	a	motion	of	salute	and	said	something	in	a	low	voice	and	something	in	the	tone	made	me	flick	my	light	across	him		
i	ca	n't	understand	it	unless	you	've	really	been	walking	about	in	your	sleep		
he	had	got	a	lamp	from	a	bracket	in	the	upper	hall	which	he	was	holding	in	the	crook	of	his	damaged	arm	so	that	we	had	a	good	light		
your	gun	i	said	to	the	landlord	and	he	brought	it	from	the	front	hall	and	passed	it	over	to	the	inspector	who	took	it	and	ejected	the	empty	shell	from	the	right	barrel		
i	stood	up	and	steadied	him	though	i	was	not	very	steady	myself		
anyway	whether	it	was	natural	or	abnatural	there	was	a	great	deal	yet	to	be	cleared	up		
i	guessed	that	a	man	who	might	get	into	the	light	of	those	particular	men	would	be	likely	to	come	to	quite	as	uncomfortable	an	ending		
we	all	crowded	into	the	front	cellar	flashing	our	lights	to	and	fro		
do	n't	ask	me	who	made	the	well	entrance	or	the	little	stairway	for	i	do	n't	know		
i	was	made	conscious	of	it	rather	by	some	inward	unused	sense	than	by	either	sight	or	sound	for	the	pale	shortradius	glare	of	the	pentacle	gave	but	a	very	poor	light	for	seeing	by		
then	i	returned	to	the	castle		
and	in	an	instant	i	had	them	into	the	passage		
she	told	me	that	i	had	made	her	feel	almost	safe	for	the	first	time	for	days		
then:'you	feel	there	's	something	wrong		
and	it	was	always	on	the	market	again	after	a	trial		
and	it	was	generally	plain	that	the	ladies	of	the	house	were	in	a	tremendous	fluster		
then	by	compass	i	laid	their	legs	to	the	eight	chief	points	and	afterward	i	drew	a	circle	with	chalk	around	them	and	opposite	to	their	feet	i	made	the	eight	signs	of	the	saaamaaa	ritual		
i	had	a	certainty	of	something	impending	as	it	might	be	the	impression	of	an	invisible	but	overwhelming	presence		
sounds	a	bit	silly	superstitious	i	know	but	when	you	are	meddling	with	this	sort	of	thing	you	've	got	to	take	notice	of	queer	fancies	and	risk	being	laughed	at		
the	bedclothes	had	been	thrown	with	such	savageness		
well	of	course	it	is	impossible	to	be	sure	one	way	or	the	other		
when	he	had	finished	his	look	round	he	went	down	to	the	village	meaning	to	see	the	onetime	agent	of	the	estate	and	arrange	for	someone	to	go	in	as	caretaker		
i	did	so	and	heard	my	wire	ring	on	metal		
then	the	door	was	tried	and	directly	afterward	there	came	a	thunderous	knocking	which	told	me	a	policeman	had	heard	the	shot		
i	can	put	it	no	other	way		
and	he	had	described	the	stupendous	force	of	the	blow	as	being	like	the	kick	of	a	great	horse		
and	directly	afterward:'what	on	earth	made	you	hustle	us	all	out	like	that	carnacki		
i	stared	in	a	bewildered	way	round	the	cellar	there	were	thin	lines	of	vague	fire	crossing	the	floor	in	all	directions	and	suddenly	i	remembered	the	piano	wire	that	the	landlord	and	i	had	stretched		
both	beaumont	and	i	gave	back	a	pace	or	two	and	then	realized	and	hung	on	to	our	courage	as	you	might	say	and	waited		
it	was	no	use	telling	anything	to	wentworth	and	the	police	until	i	was	certain	and	also	i	believed	that	i	stood	a	greater	chance	to	succeed	by	myself	though	for	that	matter	i	do	not	suppose	anything	would	have	taken	them	up	to	the	manor	again	that	night		
it	had	waited	a	long	time		
i	remember	now	that	the	idea	of	that	insensate	thing	becoming	animate	and	attacking	me	did	not	occur	to	me	with	any	sense	of	possibility	or	reality		
as	you	will	remember	it	was	a	captain	tobias	who	had	been	the	previous	tenant	and	this	was	the	very	man	who	had	appeared	from	the	well		
afterward	i	found	that	the	incident	was	wellknown	about	the	countryside	but	always	regarded	more	as	a	legend	than	as	history		
meanwhile	i	had	given	the	man	from	the	well	a	stiff	tot	of	whisky	for	which	he	thanked	me	with	a	cheerful	nod	and	having	emptied	the	glass	at	a	draft	held	his	hand	for	the	bottle	which	he	finished	as	if	it	had	been	so	much	water		
suddenly	i	saw	that	the	great	fire	was	blackening		
yet	later	he	would	persuade	himself	that	he	had	been	getting	fanciful		
it	was	you	know	as	if	i	knew		
when	i	had	done	this	i	locked	up	the	chapel	and	handed	the	key	to	sir	alfred	jarnock	having	first	taken	an	impression	in	soap		
there	may	be	other	houses	i	began		
and	i	eat	and	drank	there	as	i	stood	waiting	for	the	garments	to	come	to	dryness	and	i	walked	about	a	little	as	i	eat	for	i	was	restless	to	be	into	mine	armour	swiftly		
and	indeed	i	was	content	save	that	an	anxiousness	of	the	heart	did	stir	me	this	time	and	that	lest	some	monster	should	come	upon	us		
now	i	perceived	i	should	be	smashed	in	a	moment	if	that	i	did	not	slay	the	man	very	quick		
and	you	to	mind	how	you	did	be	also	in	the	lovedays	and	so	to	have	nice	understanding	of	my	naturalness	and	human	pride		
and	oft	did	i	call	to	naani	and	always	i	sent	the	masterword	beating	through	the	night	that	she	might	have	assurance	that	it	was	indeed	i	that	did	speak	unto	her	spirit	and	no	foul	thing	or	monster	spelling	evil	and	lies	unto	her		
and	four	times	did	monstrous	creatures	pass	by	me	but	i	was	swift	hid	and	came	to	no	harm		
and	in	truth	she	put	up	her	lips	to	me	very	sudden	and	with	a	strange	naughtiness	that	she	have	her	own	way	with	me	to	tempt	me	from	mine	anger	that	yet	she	did	half	to	like		
and	when	it	did	be	somewheres	nigh	upon	the	fourth	hour	we	came	out	of	the	thick	steam	and	the	pipings	and	the	roarings	to	be	to	our	rearward	and	soon	the	steam	to	be	gone	thin	as	but	a	mist	and	the	noises	to	be	very	farseeming	and	presently	we	to	be	come	clear	out	into	the	air	of	that	country		
and	as	may	be	thought	all	this	considering	of	my	trouble	and	the	giving	of	my	strength	unto	naani	through	the	night	of	the	world	that	she	might	have	comfort	and	help	did	work	upon	me	so	that	i	grew	thin	plainly	to	the	eye	of	those	that	loved	me		
and	surely	it	was	a	mighty	and	brutish	thing	and	so	broad	and	bulkt	as	an	ox	and	the	lower	arms	were	huge	and	greatly	haired	and	the	fingers	of	the	hands	did	have	the	nails	grown	into	horrid	talons	as	that	they	should	grip	very	bitter		
then	i	fixt	a	stone	into	the	end	of	the	strap	and	buckled	it	there	and	after	that	i	cast	the	stone	before	me	as	i	went	upon	my	hands	and	knees	and	i	did	hold	to	the	hither	end	of	the	strap	and	so	was	abled	to	have	something	of	knowledge	whether	there	lay	any	great	deepness	immediately	before	me	and	thiswise	to	strive	that	i	fall	not	down	some	monstrous	cliff	in	the	night		
and	save	that	i	was	bitter	cold	there	did	no	harm	come	to	me		
moreover	ere	any	had	power	to	leave	the	pyramid	they	must	pass	the	examination	and	be	prepared	and	some	of	this	have	i	set	out	already		
and	i	made	pause	in	the	darkness	and	had	the	maid	very	gentle	by	the	arm	that	she	should	look	with	me		
and	she	cried	out	something	in	an	utter	broke	voice	and	ran	unto	me	and	thrust	her	two	small	hands	into	my	charge	and	keeping	and	fell	thence	into	a	great	sobbing	and	shaking	so	that	i	was	all	in	trouble	to	ease	her	but	did	keep	a	silence	and	held	fast	her	hands	for	i	had	not	on	mine	armoured	gloves		
and	i	wot	that	whilst	their	mothers	wept	easeless	their	fathers	hearts	swelled	within	them	and	held	somewhat	of	their	pain	away	from	them	for	a	time		
and	i	made	no	foolishness	in	this	matter	yet	told	her	to	ease	the	cloak	a	little	about	me	so	that	i	should	have	room	to	take	the	diskos	from	my	hip	and	this	thing	i	did	and	took	the	diskos	to	my	breast	as	was	my	habit	and	surely	i	saw	that	her	eyes	did	look	at	me	with	a	little	shining	because	that	i	had	so	strange	and	fierce	a	bedmate		
and	i	to	laugh	all	tender	for	i	loved	her	so	utter	as	you	do	know	and	i	to	tell	her	as	you	sure	likewise	to	have	told	your	maid	that	i	wanted	a	pocket	sufficient	that	i	might	have	her	therein	alway	anigh	to	my	heart	and	this	thing	i	to	say	to	her	as	a	man	that	doth	love	shall	say	it	and	you	to	know	the	way	of	it	so	well	as	i.		
and	by	that	time	i	was	come	anigh	to	the	glowing	of	light	and	did	keep	now	a	strong	caution	to	my	going	for	truly	as	i	did	know	from	the	tellings	of	the	maid	there	were	very	horrid	and	dreadful	powers	in	that	land	and	i	did	well	to	remember	that	i	was	come	again	to	parts	where	might	be	the	destruction	of	the	spirit		
and	surely	i	could	see	naught	and	did	judge	as	i	have	writ	that	they	likewise	went	blindly		
yet	truly	i	was	not	wishful	to	lack	the	love	of	her	way	as	you	may	think		
and	truly	it	did	seem	a	very	land	of	fire	and	water		
and	as	i	did	begin	to	return	it	was	to	me	as	that	all	my	senses	were	newly	awake	for	i	had	a	sudden	knowing	that	i	was	within	the	atmosphere	should	i	not	call	it	of	the	monster		
and	yet	as	you	shall	believe	even	as	i	said	this	thing	to	my	mind	that	the	strange	matter	upon	the	top	of	the	rock	was	truly	one	of	the	olden	airships	i	did	feel	that	i	should	be	proper	to	doubt	for	it	was	a	very	wondrous	thing	to	perceive	a	thing	common	to	man	in	that	utter	strange	country	and	after	that	i	was	gone	so	far	off	from	the	mighty	pyramid		
as	we	did	leave	the	hollow	i	lookt	upward	unto	the	holy	light	and	behold	it	was	gone	from	us	and	by	this	thing	i	supposed	that	we	had	come	free	of	instant	danger	but	yet	did	there	be	to	me	a	seeming	of	nakedness	and	unprotection	as	you	must	perceive		
and	this	thinking	to	be	because	i	did	be	so	uplift	as	i	have	told	yet	truly	the	diskos	did	be	a	strange	and	wondrous	thing	and	did	be	alway	thought	to	have	an	oneness	with	the	man	that	did	use	it		
for	the	shining	did	seem	as	that	it	came	up	from	out	of	a	valley	as	that	there	burned	a	deep	light	in	such	a	place	but	yet	was	i	all	unsure	and	had	no	proper	knowing	whether	indeed	there	did	be	any	valley	there	but	only	a	strange	and	luminous	shining	that	did	come	upward	from	the	earth		
now	as	i	set	the	maid	again	comfortable	it	seemed	to	me	that	she	was	something	tender	and	sudden	it	came	to	me	that	mayhap	the	armour	to	be	very	hard	and	painful	unto	her	and	i	to	ask	this	thing	of	her	in	a	moment	and	she	to	see	that	i	would	not	be	put	off	and	so	to	tell	me		
now	i	walked	six	hours	and	did	stop	a	little	to	eat	and	drink	and	went	on	again		
yet	i	doubt	not	but	that	it	did	keep	my	soul	sweet	and	wholesome	and	no	useful	thing	to	the	powers	of	evil	of	the	land		
and	the	yellow	beastman	grunted	upon	the	ground	and	it	rose	up	again	to	come	at	me	and	it	stood	and	did	grunt	and	did	seem	as	that	it	was	gone	mazed	for	it	did	make	other	sounds	and	an	horrid	screeching	so	that	truly	by	the	way	of	it	i	conceived	that	it	cried	out	unknown	and	halfshapen	words	at	me		
and	this	is	but	a	little	thing	to	set	to	the	telling	yet	may	it	give	something	of	the	newness	of	all	and	moreover	shall	you	have	memory	with	me	in	this	place	how	that	oft	had	i	seen	things	and	beastmonsters	peer	over	that	same	little	tube	of	light	their	faces	coming	forward	out	of	the	night		
and	in	the	same	instant	i	did	go	to	the	right	with	a	strong	bounding	and	immediately	did	come	in	upon	the	humpt	man	from	that	side	and	i	put	my	fortune	of	life	to	the	stroke	and	stood	anigh	to	the	man	and	i	smote	him	across	the	middle	part	before	that	he	did	wot	of	my	intent		
and	so	we	to	look	ever	backward	through	dim	ages	and	surely	we	gat	presently	from	jests	unto	solemnness	and	the	maid	to	be	nigh	again	unto	tears		
and	there	had	been	for	gain	only	failure	and	the	sorrow	of	mothers	and	the	loneliness	of	wives	and	of	kin		
and	there	were	monstrous	warts	upon	the	thing	and	indents	and	a	mighty	ruggedness	and	lumpings	as	it	were	that	it	did	be	pimpled	with	great	boulders	that	were	inbred	within	that	monstrous	hide		
and	this	did	put	always	upon	me	a	new	wonder	and	unease		
now	i	saw	that	the	small	river	did	go	onward	and	did	make	a	breach	across	the	road	where	the	silent	ones	walk	and	i	determined	in	my	heart	that	i	should	leave	the	water	which	was	now	grown	nigh	to	a	bitter	cold	in	that	it	was	so	long	upon	the	face	of	the	land		
yet	even	here	they	ceased	not	to	make	the	road	but	took	it	around	and	a	mighty	way	unto	the	north	passing	it	among	strange	fires	and	pits	that	burned	from	out	of	the	earth		
and	so	i	came	at	the	last	to	a	time	when	i	had	walked	through	fourandtwenty	weariful	hours	and	was	eager	that	i	should	come	to	a	safe	place	for	my	sleep	yet	did	lack	a	happy	belief	of	safety	in	that	i	had	come	twice	anigh	to	so	grim	trouble	and	unsure	i	was	that	i	did	not	be	secretly	pursued	in	the	night		
but	in	the	valley	someways	i	had	feeling	of	assurance	that	it	must	be	for	it	was	plain	that	the	telling	of	the	book	was	sound	in	its	bottom	sense	as	might	be	seen	for	how	should	any	live	in	the	utter	bleak	and	deadly	chill	of	the	silent	upper	world	that	lay	an	hundred	miles	up	in	the	night	hid	and	lost	for	ever		
and	in	all	that	dreadful	time	since	that	she	had	come	to	be	quite	alone	she	had	heard	a	score	drear	things	for	there	had	been	once	the	slaying	of	a	young	maid	nigh	unto	her	by	some	brute	out	in	the	darkness	of	the	land	and	thrice	and	more	had	she	heard	the	feet	of	people	running	this	way	and	that	and	the	tread	of	giants	pursuing		
and	it	to	be	very	shallow	and	seeming	as	that	the	water	scarce	to	cover	the	mud	of	the	bottom		
and	immediately	we	did	begin	to	run	downward	and	with	sore	stumblings	in	this	place	and	that	but	not	to	halt	us	for	we	did	be	so	mad	as	two	children	for	the	gladsome	light		
and	after	that	i	had	seen	to	this	matter	i	returned	unto	the	firehole	and	made	a	comfortable	place	in	the	sand	for	my	rest	for	i	was	well	dry	by	this		
and	afterward	i	climbed	to	the	topmost	of	the	caves	and	told	mine	own	the	while	that	she	walk	up	and	down	a	little	so	that	she	come	to	a	full	awakedness	and	this	i	was	careful	to	because	that	she	should	have	a	need	of	all	her	powers	that	she	come	safe	upward	unto	the	cave		
but	that	something	was	always	nigh	unto	me	in	the	dark	i	do	truly	believe	yet	have	i	no	knowing	that	it	was	evil	for	it	harmed	not	me		
but	yet	did	i	to	use	my	reason	also	and	to	know	that	the	stink	might	be	from	some	monster	that	we	were	come	nigh	to	in	the	darkness	of	that	place	and	i	whispered	this	unto	the	maid	and	she	to	say	very	husht	that	it	might	be	so	but	to	have	no	belief	and	i	to	be	likewise	as	you	do	see		
and	we	went	then	for	two	good	hours	and	alway	i	did	hearten	the	maid	and	she	to	go	very	husht	and	trustful	by	me	but	truly	i	did	be	in	an	anguish	of	heart	because	that	i	was	newly	aware	that	there	did	be	such	great	and	dreadful	serpents	in	that	part	of	the	gorge	as	you	do	also	know		
and	a	great	trouble	began	to	take	me	for	indeed	naani	had	not	told	me	how	great	was	the	sea	and	it	might	be	that	i	should	wander	a	weariful	age	across	it	before	that	i	come	to	the	far	side		
yet	when	we	did	come	even	unto	the	firehole	then	did	come	again	all	about	my	heart	the	truth	of	those	dangers	that	had	seemed	but	a	while	gone	so	little		
and	because	that	we	did	be	so	wearied	i	said	unto	naani	that	we	find	a	place	for	our	slumber	and	she	very	willing	as	i	have	shown	and	to	counsel	me	likewise		
and	she	still	to	have	no	speech	with	me	but	in	a	little	to	begin	that	she	sing	in	a	low	voice	and	to	have	her	pretty	body	very	upright	and	lithesome	and	to	go	forward	with	a	wondrous	dainty	swing	so	that	my	heart	told	me	that	she	did	all	be	stirred	with	small	thrillings	of	defiance	unto	me	and	with	thrillings	of	love	and	she	to	have	the	triumph	of	her	maidenhood	and	of	her	womanhood	as	it	were	both	to	contend	in	her	and	to	thrill	upon	her	tongue	and	to	show	out	the	lilting	and	pretty	warfare	of	her	spirit	that	did	go	dancing	and	dearly	naughty	in	her	breast		
and	this	thing	i	do	pray	you	to	think	upon	that	you	understand	for	indeed	until	that	i	was	made	to	think	i	had	not	seen	it	thiswise	for	her		
and	i	walked	to	and	fore	and	moved	mine	arms	that	i	be	eased	somewhat	of	the	stiffness	and	ache	but	surely	it	did	seem	that	many	hours	must	go	ere	i	should	make	any	speed	of	travel	for	i	did	be	all	clumsy	and	slow	and	nigh	to	groan	with	the	pain	of	going	and	aught	that	i	did		
but	the	truth	of	our	own	case	lay	maybe	somewhere	between		
and	in	verity	if	naani	answered	not	to	the	word	but	there	came	instead	an	evil	power	to	destroy	me	i	should	but	cease	me	of	mine	utter	heartache		
should	he	not	find	them	to	shift	upon	his	vision	so	that	the	great	bear	and	this	and	that	shaping	of	the	star	clusterings	should	make	a	new	order	as	he	did	wander	onwards	and	so	should	he	find	that	there	was	naught	that	was	truly	fixed	as	he	did	before	then	think	but	all	to	alter	according	unto	the	place	whence	the	looking		
and	on	the	thirteenth	day	i	counted	the	tablets	and	found	that	we	yet	to	have	sufficient	if	that	we	came	unto	the	mighty	pyramid	within	any	reasonable	time		
the	flame	would	leap	and	all	the	gorge	come	to	a	wondrous	brightness	and	my	figure	to	shorten	and	the	shadows	to	be	black	and	strong		
and	in	this	wise	must	i	tell	it	it	was	at	the	seventeenth	hour	when	all	the	millions	of	the	mighty	pyramid	slept	that	i	was	with	the	master	monstruwacan	in	the	tower	of	observation	taking	my	due	turn		
and	presently	i	did	sleep	but	would	have	her	to	be	nigh	to	me	even	though	she	did	be	wakeful	and	so	we	to	be	utter	content	together		
and	i	saw	that	she	did	be	somewhat	alack	yet	that	she	touch	the	belt	because	that	i	had	whipt	her	with	it		
but	did	hear	nothing		
and	i	lookt	through	into	the	open	space	that	did	be	about	the	firehole		
and	sudden	as	i	lookt	at	mine	own	she	to	come	round	unto	me	and	she	held	out	her	arms	and	did	gaze	at	me	with	such	a	love	as	that	she	were	transfigured	and	to	need	strangely	that	she	be	in	mine	arms	and	surely	i	to	an	holy	need	that	i	have	her	unto	me	because	that	after	all	there	did	be	no	wonder	so	great	as	that	wonder	that	when	all	did	be	said	i	did	have	mine	own	after	that	all	eternity	had	nigh	past		
and	we	shaped	to	this	plan	that	naani	made	but	at	that	time	as	you	do	mind	it	was	somewhat	of	seventeen	hours	since	last	we	had	slumber	and	the	maid	was	sore	wearied	as	i	did	see		
and	this	thing	is	plain	to	you	and	needing	not	of	many	words	which	do	so	irk	me		
but	indeed	i	did	make	as	that	i	had	no	heed	that	the	maid	did	shape	her	hair	different	upon	her	head		
now	presently	as	i	walked	i	grew	something	faint	and	had	knowledge	that	i	did	foolishly	for	indeed	i	should	have	eat	after	my	fight	yet	may	i	be	forgiven	for	this	forgetting	in	that	i	had	been	much	shaked	and	put	about		
and	the	bruteman	caught	me	by	the	legs	to	rip	me	and	i	cut	quick	with	the	diskos	and	it	did	have	but	one	monstrous	talon	left	unto	it		
and	when	that	the	maid	did	show	this	dear	and	pretty	anger	i	to	take	her	into	mine	arms	and	to	tell	her	how	i	did	reverence	and	love	her	and	that	she	did	be	all	beauty	unto	me	and	i	but	to	love	her	the	more	because	that	i	did	know	the	reason	for	her	dear	shaping	of	anger	unto	me		
and	the	master	watchman	was	angry	and	demanded	why	that	none	had	called	by	the	instruments	of	the	watch	house	but	lo		
and	surely	the	maid	brought	me	from	my	dreamings	very	sensible	in	that	she	had	me	to	stand	and	she	was	gone	about	me	very	swift	and	natty	with	her	pretty	fingers	that	she	ease	me	of	mine	armour		
and	surely	i	do	wonder	whether	you	perceive	all	that	did	be	then	in	her	heart		
and	here	and	there	a	great	steam	did	come	from	it	and	spirtings	and	moundingsup	of	the	mud	in	many	places	and	monstrous	babblings	and	puffingsup	of	strange	smoke	as	that	a	great	heat	went	beneath	it	in	this	place	and	in	that		
and	i	did	this	thing	and	went	upward	into	a	great	tree	and	did	tie	my	body	to	the	tree	with	my	belts	yet	i	eat	and	drank	before	that	i	went	up	the	tree		
and	afterward	up	again	into	the	land	and	then	to	have	an	utter	caution	that	we	escape	the	watching	of	the	giants	who	did	be	ever	about	the	great	red	firehole		
and	surely	i	had	presently	failed	in	wind	and	limb	because	of	the	leapings	and	chargings	that	i	did	make	and	because	of	the	weight	of	the	armour	that	was	not	overmuch	yet	to	be	considered	but	that	i	fainted	not	was	by	reason	of	the	wondrous	hardness	and	leanness	that	i	was	grown	to	with	so	constant	a	journeying	and	strait	living	for	the	tablets	did	keep	the	strength	in	a	man	though	truly	they	eased	not	the	yearnings	of	the	belly		
yet	truly	was	not	my	journey	one	whole	thought	of	love	unto	naani		
and	after	a	longer	while	i	did	leave	that	hill	of	watchfulness	to	my	rear	and	was	gone	onward	into	the	night	yet	as	may	be	known	with	a	vague	unease	and	trouble	to	my	heart	and	a	swift	and	frequent	turning	to	learn	surely	that	no	evil	thing	came	after	me		
and	i	had	my	body	thus	between	the	evil	thing	and	the	maid		
but	to	the	most	peoples	of	the	pyramid	there	was	no	deep	conviction	nor	thought	of	any	great	hid	world	afar	in	the	darkness
