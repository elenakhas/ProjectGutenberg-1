farewell		
the	potato	harvest		
fret	not	that	thou	must	doubt	but	rid	thy	skypath	of	obstructions	strewed	  	by	winds	of	folly		
and	now	he	came	upon	a	slope	of	sward	against	the	pool		
while	worldlings	chase	each	other	madly	round	  	their	giddy	track	of	frivolous	gayety	dreamer	my	dream	earth	's	utmost	longings	bound	  	one	love	alone	is	mine	my	love	is	liberty		
a	brown	sadcolored	hillside	where	the	soil	  	fresh	from	the	frequent	harrow	deep	and	fine	  	lies	bare	no	break	in	the	remote	skyline	save	where	a	flock	of	pigeons	streams	aloft	startled	from	feed	in	some	lowlying	croft	  	or	faroff	spires	with	yellow	of	sunset	shine	  	and	here	the	sower	unwittingly	divine	exerts	the	silent	forethought	of	his	toil		
and	when	the	beasts	could	see	his	form	no	more	they	still	could	hear	him	singing	as	he	sailed	and	still	they	listened	hanging	down	their	heads	in	long	row	where	the	thin	wave	washed	and	fled		
now	at	this	season	the	reels	are	empty	and	idle	i	see	them	over	the	lines	of	the	dikes	over	the	gossiping	grass		
but	large	increase	of	knowledge	in	these	days	is	come	about	us	fraught	with	ill	for	them	whose	creeds	are	cut	too	straight	to	hold	new	growth	whose	faiths	are	clamped	against	access	of	wisdom	fraught	with	some	sadness	too	for	those	just	souls	who	clothed	in	rigid	teachings	found	too	scant	are	fain	to	piece	the	dear	accustomed	garb	till	here	a	liberal	there	a	literal	fragment	here	new	there	old	here	bright	there	dark	disclose	their	vestiture	a	strange	discordant	motley

for	love	of	his	clear	pipe	we	've	flushed	the	zigzag	snipe	have	chased	in	wilful	mood	the	woodduck	's	flapping	brood	have	spied	the	antlered	moose	cropping	the	young	green	spruce	and	watched	him	till	betrayed	by	the	kingfisher	's	sharp	tirade

we	feel	our	day	slip	by	  	and	cling	to	it	in	vain

and	now	upon	the	homeless	pack	and	paling	stream	arose	a	noiseless	wind	out	of	the	yellow	west	awhile	and	stirred	the	branches	down	the	valley	then	blew	off	to	eastward	toward	the	long	gray	straits	and	died	into	the	dark	beyond	the	utmost	verge

no	more	then	need	we	try	  	the	rapture	to	regain		
here	are	tears	upon	his	cheek	  	and	he	sleeps	that	should	be	praying	sleeps	and	dreams	and	murmurs		
he	rose	and	took	his	bow	from	the	wall	and	listened	he	heard	his	people	's	call	pierce	up	from	the	villages	one	and	all		
far	up	the	creek	his	calls	  	and	lessening	laugh	retreat	again	the	silence	falls	  	and	soft	the	green	hours	fleet

yon	sunbeam	thick	with	motes	  	athro	the	leafage	slips	to	light	the	iris	wings	  	of	dragonflies	alit	on	lilyleaves	and	things	  	of	gauze	that	float	and	flit		
he	made	up	his	mind	to	have	a	go	at	it		
but	that	it	should	actually	happen	to	him		
why	were	n't	they	afraid	of	her		
then	she	turned	and	scurried	back		
but	now	she	was	vigilant	even	when	she	seemed	asleep	and	anything	the	least	bit	out	of	the	ordinary	was	enough	to	make	her	take	alarm		
this	time	he	got	a	good	grip	and	he	could	feel	something	give		
gee		
whatever	has	been	putting	swordfish	into	your	head		
but	most	likely	he	had	never	seen	a	small	boy	before	and	he	did	not	know	what	kind	of	an	animal	it	was		
you	see	he	was	so	grumpy		
i	'm	so	glad	he	got	off	he	murmured		
here	it	was	that	the	baby	showed	herself	of	the	dominant	breed		
all	she	saw	was	a	tall	dark	ungainly	looking	longlegged	creature	half	as	tall	again	as	her	mother	had	been	with	no	horns	a	long	clumsy	head	thick	overhanging	nose	and	big	splay	hooves		
so	the	mother	knew	that	she	and	her	baby	were	not	alone	in	these	wide	bright	spaces	of	sea	and	sky		
said	uncle	andy	sarcastically		
and	he	certainly	does	manage	to	get	a	lot	of	fun	out	of	life	taking	it	all	in	all	except	when	the	owl	comes	gliding	around	his	roosting	places	in	the	black	nights	or	an	extra	bitter	midwinter	frost	catches	him	after	a	rainy	thaw		
he	had	a	soft	spot	in	his	heart	for	owls	because	they	were	so	downy	and	had	such	round	faces	and	such	round	eyes	and	looked	as	if	they	thought	of	such	wonderful	mysterious	things	which	they	would	never	tell		
flying	over	the	owl	's	head	they	kept	screaming	at	the	top	of	their	voices	something	which	probably	meant	an	owl		
the	seventh	and	eighth	were	absorbed	in	bitter	doubts	of	uncle	andy		
but	she	was	also	afraid	to	go	away		
he	raced	in	and	snatched	the	queer	thing	up	gently	enough	in	his	teeth		
demanded	uncle	andy	suspiciously		
wo	n't	go	wivout	my	teddy	bear	she	announced	with	tearful	decision		
he	dropped	from	the	scarecrow	's	trouser	leg	and	scurried	off	to	his	hole	beneath	the	toolhouse		
the	youngsters	were	getting	so	big	by	now	that	their	parents	began	to	lose	all	interest	in	them		
the	sound	was	something	between	the	bleat	of	an	extraordinary	harshvoiced	kid	and	the	scream	of	a	badly	frightened	mirganser	but	more	penetrating	and	more	strident	than	either		
is	it	big		
in	two	seconds	he	was	back	at	uncle	andy	's	side	where	the	latter	sat	smoking	on	his	favorite	log	by	the	water		
whimpering	and	pawing	at	his	face	he	crunched	a	great	mouthful	of	the	comb	bees	and	all		
but	it	was	n't		
neither	the	white	dog	nor	the	boy	nor	the	oneeyed	gander	was	anywhere	in	sight		
murmured	the	child	enviously		
but	they	did	not	go	very	far	that	day	or	have	any	more	very	exciting	adventures		
at	last	the	raft	catching	in	the	trees	of	a	submerged	islet	came	softly	to	a	stop	so	softly	as	not	to	awaken	the	little	pair	of	sleepers		
she	knew	that	grim	shape	all	too	well	and	it	was	darting	straight	at	her	baby	its	terrible	sword	standing	out	keen	and	straight	from	its	pointed	snout		
she	was	too	frightened	to	save	her	strength	of	course	and	so	kept	flapping	with	all	her	might	as	if	she	thought	to	fly	away	with	scarecrow	and	all		
then	it	bounded	into	the	bushes	on	a	short	circle	saving	itself	unnecessary	effort	as	if	it	had	accurately	estimated	the	tactics	of	its	panicstricken	quarry		
she	would	huddle	up	beneath	her	mother	's	belly	or	crowd	down	among	the	rest	of	the	herd	for	warmth	but	long	before	christmas	she	had	become	a	mere	bag	of	bones		
at	the	sight	of	it	as	they	came	upon	it	suddenly	around	a	bend	of	the	stream	their	fur	bristled	and	they	crouched	flat	glancing	angrily	this	way	and	that		
and	he	went	scurrying	across	the	yard	to	see	about	it		
but	the	boy	did	not	run	away		
this	led	him	into	the	farmyard		
he	fell	back	with	a	terrific	splash	which	set	the	monster	rolling	and	for	perhaps	a	minute	his	struggles	lashed	the	sea	into	foam		
his	mother	however	lay	with	her	mouth	half	open	a	vast	cavern	of	a	mouth	nearly	a	third	the	length	of	her	bodyand	it	looked	all	whalebone		
you	must	learn	to	discriminate		
said	he		
said	he		
the	tree	looked	so	much	more	interesting	than	her	bare	raft	on	which	she	had	been	voyaging	for	over	an	hour	and	of	which	she	was	now	heartily	tired		
and	in	a	minute	more	they	were	both	hard	at	it	having	the	time	of	their	liveshawks	foxes	minks	and	vanished	parents	alike	forgotten		
then	he	applied	fresh	earth	to	both	the	babe	's	stings	and	his	own		
he	hated	the	whole	tribe	with	bitter	hatred	but	at	the	same	time	his	caution	was	unsleeping		
but	happily	the	boy	and	the	white	dog	came	running	up	in	the	nick	of	time		
it	's	stung	me		
the	calf	however	looking	very	small	and	neat	and	bright	in	her	clean	coat	of	fawn	color	beside	the	gaunt	awkward	moose	babies	was	not	in	the	least	afraid	of	the	disagreeable	strangers		
prairie	dog	village	was	of	considerable	size	covering	as	it	did	perhaps	a	dozen	acres	of	the	dry	light	prairie	soil		
for	she	had	got	her	grip	so	high	up	on	the	mink	's	neck	that	he	could	not	twist	his	head	around	far	enough	to	catch	her	by	the	throat		
the	boy	his	face	a	mixture	of	amusement	and	concern	picked	up	the	captive	without	noticing	her	feeble	pecks	undid	the	noose	from	her	leg	and	carried	her	over	the	hedge	to	rest	and	recover	herself		
she	had	certainly	been	very	amusing	but	the	child	drew	a	breath	of	relief	when	she	was	gone		
for	one	astounded	moment	she	settled	back	onto	the	scarecrow	's	head	frightened	into	stillness		
the	bear	with	the	influence	of	her	comforting	warmth	still	strong	upon	him	yielded		
the	little	villager	who	had	just	come	out	of	his	burrow	sat	straight	up	on	his	hindquarters	on	the	top	of	his	hillock	with	his	forepaws	hanging	meekly	over	his	breast	and	glared	all	about	him	to	see	if	any	danger	was	in	sight		
the	magic	of	the	hour	took	it	and	transmuted	it	and	made	it	a	note	in	the	chord	of	the	great	stillness		
it	was	about	the	end	of	the	blueberry	season	when	teddy	bear	lost	his	big	rustycoated	mother	and	small	glossy	black	sister	and	found	himself	completely	alone	in	the	world		
and	he	lives	only	in	the	salt	water	fortunately		
before	she	came	to	live	on	the	anderson	farm	she	used	to	have	a	burrow	over	on	the	other	side	of	the	ridge	where	the	people	went	in	for	a	good	deal	of	trapping	and	snaring		
in	fact	it	was	the	hardest	to	climb		
he	knew	that	the	babe	would	trudge	on	till	he	dropped	in	his	tracks	before	acknowledging	that	he	was	tired		
it	was	terrible		
he	asked	politely		
answered	uncle	andy		
he	hated	to	answer	any	of	the	child	's	most	innocent	questions	directly	if	he	could	get	at	them	in	a	roundabout	way		
baby	as	she	was	she	was	game		
in	a	couple	of	minutes	he	was	busy	licking	himself	all	over	to	make	sure	he	was	undamaged		
so	he	came	along	through	the	bushes	at	a	run	taking	no	precautions	whatever		
it	was	a	long	way	off	from	silverwater	began	uncle	andy	in	a	faraway	voice	and	with	a	faraway	look	in	his	eyes	that	the	whale	calf	was	born		
and	it	's	no	more	than	right		
the	sea	in	great	spots	and	patches	is	full	of	tiny	creatures	sometimes	jellyfish	sometimes	little	squid	of	various	kinds	all	traveling	in	countless	hosts	from	somewhereorother	to	somewhere	else	they	know	not	why		
but	there	was	teddy	bear	now	a	cub	over	the	foothills	of	sugar	loaf	mountain	and	he	was	not	a	fool		
at	last	she	sprang	once	more	into	the	air	determined	to	have	nothing	more	to	do	with	the	treacherous	scarecrow	who	had	stuck	that	thing	on	her	leg		
returned	uncle	andy	quite	shortly	with	his	customary	objection	to	being	interrupted		
chapter	xiii	the	little	sly	one	from	away	up	near	the	top	of	the	rocky	hill	that	rose	abruptly	across	the	inlet	came	a	terrible	screech	piercing	and	startling		
bill	the	guide	would	go	off	to	the	lumber	camps	beyond	the	ottanoonsis	and	silverwater	would	be	left	to	the	snow	and	the	solitude	of	winter		
so	they	spent	most	of	their	time	outside	on	the	hillock	gossiping	about	it	to	their	neighbors	who	were	extremely	interested	and	full	of	suggestions	but	showed	no	inclination	whatever	to	come	and	help	turn	the	intruders	out		
    	they	know	no	light	nor	any	star	    	those	ruined	plains	of	tantramar		
there	they	died	to	a	man	but	not	till	they	had	slain	so	many	of	the	savages	that	the	invading	force	was	shattered	and	compelled	to	withdraw

all	this	you	knew	and	loved	with	me	all	this	in	our	delight	had	part	    	and	nowthough	us	earth	sees	no	more	as	comrades	heart	to	heart	    	this	kindly	strength	of	open	fields	this	faith	of	eve	this	calm	of	air	    	they	lift	my	spirit	close	to	you	in	memory	and	prayer		
 	one	moment	in	that	surging	hell	    	the	old	wharf	shook	then	cringed	and	fell		
across	the	tide	a	sail	that	tosses	and	is	gone	    	and	in	my	heart	the	kiss	that	longing	dreams	upon		
we	started	off	with	racingteams	and	moonlight	on	the	snow	        	oh	the	frost	is	on	the	forest	and	the	snow	piles	high	    	and	soon	again	the	winter	world	was	voiceless	as	of	old	    	alone	with	all	the	wheeling	stars	and	the	great	white	cold		
down	the	dusk	hillside	lumbers	the	wain	and	day	fades	out	like	smoke		
she	does	not	heed	the	storm		
o’er	the	loud	world	sweep	the	scourge	and	the	rod	    	but	in	deep	beyond	deep	is	the	stillness	of	god	    	at	the	fountains	of	life	    	no	cry	no	strife		
sombre	impenetrable	round	its	rim	the	firtrees	bend	and	brood

the	plains	lie	dim	below		
marsyas	    	a	little	grey	hillglade	closeturfed	withdrawn	    	beyond	resort	or	heed	of	trafficking	feet	    	ringed	round	with	slim	trunks	of	the	mountain	ash		
they	go	where	follow	our	smiles	and	tears	the	gold	of	youth	and	the	gray	of	age	    	where	falls	the	storm	and	falls	the	stillness	the	laughter	of	spring	and	winter	’s	rage		
faints	in	the	sudden	blare	    	the	cry	of	their	swift	despair	    	and	the	captives’	deathchant	shrills		
oh	merry	swing	the	axes	and	the	bright	chips	fly	    	the	dishes	on	the	dressershelves	were	shining	blue	and	white	    	and	o’er	the	loaded	table	the	lamps	beamed	bright		
tonight	athwart	an	inky	sky	    	a	narrowing	sun	dropped	angrily	    	scoring	the	gloom	with	dreadful	dye	        	a	bitter	and	flaming	scar		
black	on	the	ridge	against	that	lonely	flush	a	cart	and	stoopnecked	oxen	ranged	beside	some	barrels	and	the	dayworn	harvestfolk	    	here	emptying	their	baskets	jar	the	hush	with	hollow	thunders		
these	common	fields	appear	    	the	consecrated	home	of	hopes	past	number		
and	we	washed	them	down	with	tides	of	tea	and	oceans	of	spruce	beer		
the	mowing	    	this	is	the	voice	of	high	midsummer	’s	heat		
oh	merry	swing	the	axes	and	the	bright	chips	fly	    	the	hard	wood	and	the	soft	wood	we	felled	them	for	our	use	    	and	chiefly	for	its	scented	gum	we	loved	the	scaly	spruce	        	oh	the	frost	is	on	the	forest	and	the	snow	piles	high	    	and	here	and	there	with	solemn	roar	some	hoary	tree	came	down	    	and	we	heard	the	rolling	of	the	years	in	the	thunder	of	its	crown

’twas	a	tallish	tramp	i	tell	you	aleadin’	that	flounderin’	mare	    	thro’	snow	drifts	anywheres	from	four	to	six	foot	deep		
it	seems	the	spirit	of	a	flower	    	this	offspring	of	the	autumn	hour	    	wandering	back	to	earth	to	bring	    	some	kindly	afterthought	of	spring		
the	snow	hung	down	the	woodpiles	all	scallopedlike	an’	curled

but	’twas	grand	to	hear	nance	sing	glory	to	the	newborn	king,’	    	tho’	the	way	the	choir	folks	stared	at	us	it	made	me	kind	of	narvous

oh	merry	swing	the	axes	and	the	bright	chips	fly	    	so	still	the	air	and	chill	the	air	the	branches	seemed	asleep	    	but	we	broke	their	ancient	visions	as	the	axe	bit	deep		
and	to	pilot	the	noiseless	foe	    	through	the	perilous	passes	go	    	two	women	who	could	not	die	    	whom	the	knife	in	the	dark	passed	by		
when	comes	the	hour	to	break	this	’prisoning	shard	and	reunite	with	him	that	breathed	me	forth	    	then	shall	this	atom	of	the	eternal	soul	    	encompass	thee	in	its	benign	control		
amid	its	goldgreen	coverts	meet	    	the	late	dew	and	the	noonday	heat	    	around	it	to	the	searim	harsh	    	the	patient	levels	of	the	marsh	    	and	o’er	it	the	pale	heavens	bent	    	half	sufferance	and	half	content		
the	succour	of	gluskâp	a	micmac	legend	    	the	happy	valley	laughed	with	sun	the	corn	grew	firm	in	stalk	    	the	lodges	clustered	safe	where	run	the	streams	of	peniawk		
in	vain	these	aching	lips	these	hungering	hearts	that	strain	    	toward	the	denied	fruition	of	our	bliss	had	love	not	learned	of	longing	to	devise	out	of	desire	and	dream	our	paradise		
an’	i	could	feel	her	shoulder	kind	of	comfortin’	an’	warm	    	nestlin’	agin	my	arm	sech	a	sweet	an’	cunnin’	shoulder

a	holy	music	heard	in	vain	    	by	coward	heart	and	sordid	brain	to	whom	this	strenuous	being	seems	    	naught	but	a	greedy	race	for	gain		
my	eyes	are	on	the	greening	earth	the	exultant	bobolinks	wild	awing	    	and	yet	of	all	this	kindly	gladness	my	heart	beholds	not	anything		
long	rest	we	soon	shall	earn		
tides	    	through	the	still	dusk	how	sighs	the	ebbtide	out	reluctant	for	the	reedbeds		
and	when	the	windless	noon	grew	hot	and	the	white	sun	beat	like	steel	    	in	shade	about	the	shimmering	pot	they	gathered	to	their	meal		
it	lies	forgotten	of	all	tides	    	the	grass	grows	round	its	bleaching	sides	    	an	endless	inland	peace	abides	        	about	its	mouldering	age
