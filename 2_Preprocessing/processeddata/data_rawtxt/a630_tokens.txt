there	was	one	chanceour	hero	tried	at	this	moment	to	think	it	the	best	possible	chancethat	miss	nugent	might	marry	mr.	salisbury	and	settle	in	england		
the	beauty	of	the	rooms	would	have	answered	lady	catharine	's	purpose	for	some	time	had	not	lady	anne	imprudently	brought	the	conversation	back	again	to	miss	broadhurst		
soho	had	engaged	to	make	a	new	set	vastly	improved	by	sir	horace	's	suggestions	for	her	grace	of	torcaster		
it	was	like	what	she	would	have	done	herself	and	likein	short	it	is	what	few	young	men	as	she	said	of	the	present	day	would	do		
formerly	a	few	families	had	set	the	fashion

soho	there	is	your	money		
the	party	opposed	to	lady	dashfort	affirmed	that	her	wit	depended	merely	on	unexpectedness	a	characteristic	which	may	be	applied	to	any	impropriety	of	speech	manner	or	conduct		
the	conversation	extended	from	dublin	to	various	parts	of	ireland	with	all	which	sir	james	brooke	showed	that	he	was	well	acquainted

lord	colambre	took	down	the	direction	tossed	the	honest	waggoner	a	guinea	wished	him	goodnight	passed	and	went	on		
it	was	old	mr.	reynolds	's	delight	to	come	down	and	surprise	his	people	at	his	different	places	and	see	that	they	were	keeping	all	tight		
his	excellency	's	executor	sir	james	brooke	however	was	indefatigable	in	his	researches		
my	dear	boy

i	might	kick	him	for	my	football	this	half	hour	before	i	should	get	him	awake		
the	refusal	of	his	present	dwelt	upon	the	attorney	’s	mind	and	he	was	aware	that	if	the	history	of	susan	’s	lamb	ever	reached	the	abbey	he	was	undone		
all	alive	and	kicking		
he	was	pressed	to	give	the	words	belonging	to	the	music	and	at	last	he	modestly	offered	to	repeat	them	as	he	could	not	see	to	write

his	daniel	cooper	was	given	in	an	excellent	style	and	was	loudly	encored		
this	is	the	new	name	instead	of	the	telegraph	because	of	its	allusion	to	the	logographic	printing	press	which	prints	words	instead	of	letters		
2	1800	my	mother	has	had	a	sore	throat	and	aunt	charlotte	and	honora	have	had	feverish	attacks	and	john	jenkins	has	had	fever	so	that	my	father	was	obliged	to	remove	him	to	his	own	house	in	the	village		
a	maid	at	the	hotel	at	dunkirk	said	to	me	ah		
1776	d.	unmarried	1841		
no	mortal	could	ever	have	guessed	that	he	was	an	invalid	if	they	had	only	heard	him	speak	just	as	i	had	here	stopped	writing	my	father	came	out	of	his	room	looking	wretchedly	but	ordered	the	carriage	and	said	he	would	go	to	longford	to	see	mr.	fallon	about	materials	for	william	's	bridge		
and	when	she	died	her	coffin	was	to	avoid	the	crooked	passages	taken	out	of	the	window		
she	went	a	journey	when	she	was	thirteen	with	doctor	and	mrs.	beaufort	and	my	mother	and	they	are	the	only	people	in	this	country	who	can	and	will	swear	to	her	and	for	her		
i	forgot	to	tell	you	that	we	spent	a	delightful	day	or	remnant	of	a	day	on	our	return	from	the	priory	at	mr.	strutt	's		
the	play	mentioned	in	the	foregoing	letter	was	twice	acted	in	january	1799	with	great	applause	under	the	title	of	whim	for	whim	mr.	edgeworth	's	mechanism	for	the	scenery	and	for	the	experiments	tried	on	the	children	were	most	ingenious		
lady	davy	is	in	high	glory	at	this	moment	introducing	madame	de	staël	everywhere	enjoying	the	triumph	and	partaking	the	gale		
mr.	ward	was	undersecretary	of	state	during	a	great	part	of	pitt	's	administration	and	has	been	one	of	the	lords	of	the	admiralty	and	is	now	clerk	of	the	ordnance	and	has	been	sent	to	ireland	to	reform	abuses	in	the	ordnance		
but	faith	great	faith	is	i	believe	necessary	to	produce	any	effect	upon	the	drinkers	and	i	have	seen	some	of	the	adventurous	philosophers	who	sought	in	vain	for	satisfaction	in	the	bag	of	gaseous	oxyd	and	found	nothing	but	a	sick	stomach	and	a	giddy	head		
it	goes	over	tonight	to	johnson	but	how	long	it	will	remain	with	him	before	you	see	it	in	print	i	can	not	divine		
we	went	fine	large	hall	ranged	with	green	benches	like	a	lecture	room	raised	platform	at	one	end	for	the	performers	armchairs	for	the	royal	dukes	and	common	chairs	for	common	men		
i	even	like	miss	berry	much	the	better	for	the	manner	in	which	she	has	edited	this	book		
here	is	a	fine	sentence		
the	prethe	chevalier	is	beautifully	drawn	  	a	prince	ay	every	inch	a	prince		
the	distinctness	of	the	parts		
dumont	read	it	as	well	as	tessier	could	have	read	it	but	there	were	things	which	seemed	as	if	they	were	written	on	purpose	for	the	célibataire	who	was	listening	and	the	célibataire	who	was	reading		
footnote	mr.	edgeworth	's	second	daughter	emmeline		
he	lives	in	a	wretched	house	and	we	went	up	dirty	stairs	through	dirty	passages	where	i	wondered	how	fine	ladies	trains	and	noses	could	go	and	were	received	in	a	dark	small	den	by	the	philosopher	or	rather	dévot	for	he	spurns	the	name	of	philosopher	he	was	in	a	dirty	reddish	nightgown	and	very	dirty	nightcap	bound	round	the	forehead	with	a	superlatively	dirty	chocolatecoloured	ribbon		
perhaps	we	may	be	detained	here	for	some	days	as	the	wind	is	directly	against	us	but	we	have	no	reason	to	lament	as	we	are	in	grandsire	's	excellent	house	and	have	books	and	thoughts	enough	to	occupy	us		
her	daughter	madame	gautier	gains	upon	our	esteem	every	day		
amongst	the	many	kindnesses	my	father	has	shown	me	the	greatest	i	think	has	been	his	permitting	me	to	see	his	heart	à	découverte	and	i	have	seen	by	your	kind	sincerity	and	his	that	in	good	and	cultivated	minds	love	is	no	idle	passion	but	one	that	inspires	useful	and	generous	energy		
i	have	just	risen	from	my	bed	where	i	had	been	a	day	and	a	half	with	a	violent	headache	and	pains	or	as	john	langan	calls	them	pins	in	my	bones		
took	leave	of	home	and	set	out	for	edinburgh		
has	maria	told	you	that	she	has	had	her	belinda	translated	into	french	by	the	young	count	de	segur	an	amiable	young	man	of	one	of	the	most	ancient	families	of	france	married	to	a	granddaughter	of	the	chancellor	d'aguesseau

i	am	sorry	to	say	that	from	these	last	accounts	of	the	pinna	and	his	cancer	friend	dr.	darwin	's	beautiful	description	is	more	poetic	than	accurate		
i	wish	you	had	been	here	for	i	think	you	would	have	been	entertained	much	not	only	by	his	conversation	but	by	his	character	i	never	saw	a	man	who	had	lived	in	the	world	so	anxious	about	the	opinions	which	are	formed	of	him	by	those	with	whom	he	is	conversing	so	quick	at	discovering	by	the	countenance	and	by	implication	what	is	thought	of	him	or	so	incessantly	alert	in	guarding	all	the	suspected	places	in	your	opinion		
edgeworthstown	june	1	1805	my	father	's	birthday	was	kept	yesterday	much	more	agreeably	than	last	year	for	then	we	had	company	in	the	house		
edgeworthstown	may	23	1806	i	have	been	laughed	at	most	unmercifully	by	some	of	the	phlegmatic	personages	round	the	library	table	for	my	impatience	to	send	you	the	mine	do	you	think	margaret	can	not	live	five	minutes	longer	without	it

now	it	is	no	easy	thing	for	a	french	postillion	to	walk	himself	when	he	is	in	his	boots	these	boots	are	each	as	large	and	as	stiff	as	a	wooden	churn	and	when	the	man	in	his	boots	attempts	to	walk	he	is	more	helpless	than	a	child	in	a	gocart	he	waddles	on	dragging	his	boots	after	him	in	a	way	that	would	make	a	pig	laugh		
maria	is	writing	a	story	footnote	miss	edgeworth	made	a	sketch	for	the	story	of	madame	de	fleury	about	this	time	but	did	not	finish	it	till	long	afterwards

mrs	edgeworth	to	mrs	mary	sneyd		
a	lady	told	me	it	was	vraiment	extraordinaire	qu'un	jeune	homme	comme	lui	ait	de	moeurs	si	exemplaireset	d'ailleurs	on	ne	s'attend	pas	qu'un	homme	soit	fidèle	à	une	femme	qui	est	plus	agée	que	lui	mais	si	agée	aussi		
i	believe	that	old	castles	interest	one	by	calling	up	ideas	of	past	times	which	are	in	such	strong	contrast	with	the	present		
it	was	ingenious	to	make	them	in	the	shape	of	fish	because	their	motions	exactly	resemble	the	breathing	and	panting	and	floundering	and	tailcurling	of	fish	and	i	am	sure	i	have	tired	you	with	them	and	you	will	be	sick	of	these	fish		
yesterday	sneyd	now	at	home	for	his	vacation	who	is	ever	the	promoter	of	gaiety	contrived	a	pretty	little	fête	champêtre	which	surprised	us	all	most	agreeably		
the	morning	after	mr.	standish	's	arrival	lady	stafford	's	maid	told	her	that	she	and	all	the	ladies	maids	had	been	taken	by	his	gentleman	to	see	his	toilette"which	i	assure	you	my	lady	is	the	thing	best	worth	seeing	in	this	house	all	of	gilt	plate	and	i	wish	my	lady	you	had	such	a	dressing	box		
he	was	an	amiable	and	benevolent	man	so	eager	against	the	slavetrade	that	when	he	drank	tea	with	us	he	always	brought	some	east	india	sugar	that	he	might	not	share	our	wickedness	in	eating	that	made	by	the	negro	slave		
i	have	read	corinne	with	my	father	and	i	like	it	better	than	he	does		
i	liked	the	glass	doors	opening	to	the	gardens	at	the	end	and	trees	in	full	leaf		
sneyd	is	delighted	with	the	four	volumes	of	evenings	at	home	which	we	have	just	got	and	has	pitched	upon	the	best	stories	which	he	does	not	like	m.	dalambert	spoil	in	the	reading"perseverance	against	fortune	the	price	of	a	victory	and	capriole

one	of	our	greatest	pleasures	has	been	the	hearing	everybody	from	edward	upwards	speak	of	sneyd	and	william	with	such	affection	and	with	such	knowledge	of	their	characters		
buonaparte	rode	down	the	lines	on	a	fine	white	spanish	horse		
we	saw	one	of	these	a	teacher	at	one	of	the	chief	academies	and	my	father	who	was	standing	near	him	heard	him	after	having	been	talking	on	several	most	amusing	and	interesting	subjects	give	one	of	the	deepest	sighs	he	ever	heard
