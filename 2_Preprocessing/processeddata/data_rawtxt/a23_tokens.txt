i	suppose	it	was	on	account	of	the	fact	of	his	being	taken	in	some	measure	unawares	that	i	caught	him	on	two	or	three	occasions	regarding	me	fixedly	in	a	way	that	disquieted	me	somewhat	having	been	lately	in	so	little	society	till	my	glance	aroused	him	from	his	reverie	and	he	looked	elsewhere	in	some	confusion		
but	seeing	that	ethelberta	did	not	smile	she	turned	the	subject	and	added	docilely	did	you	come	up	for	me	to	do	anything		
if	the	visitor	turned	out	to	be	sir	john	he	had	determined	to	confront	him		
he	became	gleeful	and	said	to	himself	nervously	palming	his	hip	with	his	left	hand	as	if	previous	to	plunging	it	into	hot	water	for	some	prize	upon	my	life	i	've	a	good	mind		
as	a	man	devoted	to	art	ladywell	who	has	had	the	honour	of	being	hung	higher	up	on	the	academy	walls	than	any	other	living	painter	you	should	take	out	your	sketchbook	and	dash	off	the	scene		
this	storm	like	the	first	is	of	the	nature	of	a	squall	and	it	ends	as	abruptly	as	the	other		
if	you	do	speak	of	it		
the	pa'son	might	have	forgi'ed	'em	when	he	learned	the	truth	o't	but	the	squire	would	not		
perhaps	johns	was	right	he	would	say		
because	he	is	old	enough	to	be	my	grandfather	and	yours	too		
barnet	had	done	the	same	thing	and	turned	away		
mrs.	marchmill	opened	one	of	the	books	and	saw	the	owner	's	name	written	on	the	titlepage		
stockdale	had	gone	away	to	knollsea	in	the	morning	to	be	present	at	some	commemoration	service	there	and	on	his	return	he	was	met	by	the	attractive	lizzy	in	the	passage		
yes	but	i	do	not	leave	rouen	till	the	afternoon		
said	he		
who	is	that	lady		
michael	a	old	man	like	you	ought	to	think	about	other	things	and	not	be	looking	two	ways	at	your	time	of	life		
restless	and	selfreproachful	as	he	was	he	could	not	resist	a	smile	as	he	thought	of	the	terrifying	oath	of	compact	sealed	by	a	kiss	upon	the	stones	of	a	pagan	temple		
he	held	me	by	the	hand	and	waisto	so	tightand	would	not	let	me	go	till	i	had	promised	to	meet	him	again		
there	was	now	a	lull	in	the	discourse	and	soon	the	van	descended	the	hill	leading	into	the	long	straggling	village		
in	the	train	she	had	seen	a	weekly	local	paper	and	read	there	a	paragraph	detailing	the	inquest	on	charles		
and	with	a	burst	of	real	eloquence	he	went	on	to	declare	all	sorts	of	things	that	he	would	do	for	her		
yesbut	what	was	that	my	good	lady		
while	they	were	here	lady	jane	joy	and	some	other	friends	of	the	viscount	told	ethelberta	that	they	were	probably	coming	on	to	knollsea		
philip	tell	the	worst	and	take	your	time		
i	'll	consider	whether	i	am	or	not	he	pleasantly	replied		
conjecture	was	directed	to	the	question	how	bellston	had	got	there	and	conjecture	alone	could	give	an	explanation		
then	the	merry	guests	tumbled	through	doors	at	the	further	end	and	dancing	began		
you	are	quite	positive		
from	this	place	he	proceeded	quickly	over	a	shoulder	of	the	declivity	a	little	to	the	left	presently	returning	on	horseback	which	proved	that	his	horse	had	been	tethered	in	some	secret	place	down	there		
what		
from	that	day	he	was	invisible	for	so	long	a	time	that	she	thought	he	had	gone	away	altogether		
heddegan		
inquired	the	milkman	lifting	his	ear		
when	the	ten	minutes	break	occurred	christopher	was	the	first	of	the	two	to	speak		
however	the	friendship	between	him	and	the	heymeresas	the	uncle	and	niece	were	namedwarmed	and	warmed	by	degrees	there	being	but	few	folk	o	note	in	the	vicinity	at	that	time	which	made	a	newcomer	if	he	were	at	all	sociable	and	of	good	credit	always	sure	of	a	welcome		
she	repeated		
it	was	said	by	her	detractors	afterwards	that	she	had	chosen	her	lodging	to	be	near	this	gentleman	but	there	is	reason	to	believe	that	she	had	never	seen	him	till	her	arrival	there		
as	soon	as	he	got	into	the	house	and	before	entering	his	own	rooms	he	advanced	to	the	door	of	the	little	back	parlour	in	which	lizzy	usually	sat	with	her	mother		
my	mother	and	herself	both	think	that	the	marriage	should	not	take	place	till	next	year		
he	stepped	aside	into	an	empty	room	till	she	had	lit	a	taper	and	had	passed	on	to	her	boudoir		
i	should	like	to	live	in	london	best	murmured	picotee	her	head	sinking	mournfully	to	one	side		
the	baritone	started	at	the	unexpected	sight	but	recovering	from	his	surprise	said	very	well	as	you	will	though	perhaps	his	tone	showed	a	slight	want	of	confidence		
by	god		
he	musingly	looked	out	of	the	window		
for	i	see	what	you	do	n't	that	it	is	a	good	and	flourishing	match	for	you	a	very	honourable	offer	in	mr.	darton		
presently	he	said	would	you	have	waited	for	me	if	you	had	known		
the	best	reason	on	earth	said	neigh		
you	fell	off	the	bed	surely		
during	the	progress	of	repairs	at	this	bower	barbara	frequently	visited	it		
replied	lucy	looking	round	at	the	hall		
say	no	say	no		
i	do	n't	think	i	told	you		
ah	rogeri	thought	it	was	john		
		
but	it	is	wrong	emmeline	all	the	same		
christopher	said	nothing	and	turned	over	the	poems		
by	a	sorry	but	unconscious	misapplication	of	sound	and	wide	reasoning	did	the	active	mind	of	ethelberta	thus	find	itself	a	solace		
there	that	's	just	it		
it	happened	to	be	marketday	and	nicholas	having	postponed	the	engagements	which	called	him	thither	to	keep	the	appointment	with	her	in	the	sallows	rushed	off	at	the	end	of	the	afternoon	to	attend	to	them	as	well	as	he	could		
mr.		
he	did	not	reply	and	selina	observed	that	his	ear	and	the	side	of	his	face	were	quite	white		
the	child	was	quite	ruined	by	it	he	became	quite	a	drivelling	idiot	and	soon	afterward	died		
o	what	a	tangled	web	we	weave	when	first	we	practise	to	deceive		
try	to	keep	faith	with	herher	young	heart	is	tender	believe	me	there	is	no	mistake	in	the	quality	of	her	love	for	you		
i	'll	take	care	my	love		
the	horse	carried	double	the	girl	being	on	a	pillion	behind	her	lover		
his	frame	was	stalwart	though	slightly	stooping		
you	leave	dorothy	behind	for	the	present		
o	georginahow	candid		
answer	one	word		
she	'll	see	enough	o	me	soon		
involuntarily	she	slipped	from	her	left	hand	the	symbol	of	her	wifehood		
tis	only	a	matter	of	time	said	the	calm	young	philosopher		
yes		
an	old	treatise	on	casuistry	lay	on	the	top	shelf		
it	is	good	of	you	she	said	trembling	a	little		
charles	she	says	has	pleaded	that	their	marriage	may	just	as	well	be	this	year	as	next	and	he	seems	to	have	nearly	converted	my	mother	to	the	same	way	of	thinking		
she	answered	eagerly	i	'll	hold	the	reins	while	you	run	forward	to	the	top	of	the	ridge	and	see	if	the	road	takes	a	favourable	turn	beyond		
but	for	an	accidental	overhauling	of	the	waste	journals	in	his	study	he	might	not	have	known	of	the	event	for	years		
she	spoke	desperately		
and	then	they	were	silent	again		
the	fact	is	milly	she	had	a	notion	that	i	was	wishing	to	marry	her	and	since	she	's	discovered	i	've	promised	another	and	a	prettier	than	she	i	'm	rather	afeard	of	her	temper	if	she	sees	us	together		
well	the	best	thing	you	can	do	is	to	write	and	tell	her	all	about	it	and	throw	yourself	upon	her	generosity		
the	consummate	charm	of	the	lines	seemed	to	winterborne	though	he	divined	that	they	were	a	quotation	to	be	somehow	the	result	of	his	lost	love	's	charms	upon	fitzpiers		
she	cried	to	herself		
indeed	that	's	not	so	mrs.	fitzpiers		
his	was	the	selfish	passion	of	congreve	's	millamont	to	whom	love	's	supreme	delight	lay	in	that	heart	which	others	bleed	for	bleed	for	me		
very	well	he	said		
but	here	was	the	fact	which	could	not	be	disguised	since	seeing	what	an	immense	change	her	last	twelve	months	of	absence	had	produced	in	his	daughter	after	the	heavy	sum	per	annum	that	he	had	been	spending	for	several	years	upon	her	education	he	was	reluctant	to	let	her	marry	giles	winterborne	indefinitely	occupied	as	woodsman	cidermerchant	applefarmer	and	what	not	even	were	she	willing	to	marry	him	herself		
you	mean	mrs.	charmond		
she	will	run	down	through	that	opening	much	faster	than	she	went	up	it	if	she	is	like	the	rest	of	the	girls		
my	young	man	tim	tangs	said	she		
you	probably	pray	the	samefor	other	reasons		
spring	weather	came	on	rather	suddenly	the	unsealing	of	buds	that	had	long	been	swollen	accomplishing	itself	in	the	space	of	one	warm	night		
i	am	very	much	shaken	she	said		
ch	have	done	it	once	already	miss		
when	the	sun	shines	on	the	north	front	of	sherton	abbeythat	's	when	my	happiness	will	come	to	me		
it	quite	terrified	him	when	he	first	saw	what	you	had	done	to	it	this	morning	she	added		
to	his	inquiry	if	she	were	hurt	she	made	some	incoherent	reply	to	the	effect	that	she	did	not	know		
she	had	made	it	for	herself	mainly	by	her	appearance	and	attractive	behavior	to	him	since	her	return		
at	noon	she	heard	a	slight	rustling	outside	the	window	and	found	that	it	was	caused	by	an	eft	which	had	crept	out	of	the	leaves	to	bask	in	the	last	sunrays	that	would	be	worth	having	till	the	following	may.		
at	first	he	had	a	particular	objection	to	enter	the	parlor	because	his	boots	were	dusty	but	as	the	surgeon	insisted	he	waived	the	point	and	came	in		
goodby		
at	her	father	's	usual	hour	for	retiring	he	again	came	in	to	see	her		
a	premonition	that	she	could	not	resist	him	if	he	came	strangely	moved	her		
she	said	regarding	him	with	wild	uncertainty		
others	have	been	like	it	afore	in	hintock		
between	four	and	five	fitzpiers	arrived	hitching	his	horse	to	the	hook	outside	the	door		
she	is	so	nice		
this	letter	contained	in	fact	marty	's	declaration	that	she	was	the	original	owner	of	mrs.	charmond	's	supplementary	locks	and	enclosed	a	sample	from	the	native	stock	which	had	grown	considerably	by	this	time		
without	replying	he	raised	his	arm	and	moved	his	finger	till	he	fixed	it	at	a	point		
presently	he	looked	across	at	winterborne		
how	long	has	it	been	introduced		
we	may	have	been	wrong	he	began	almost	fearfully	in	supposing	that	it	can	all	be	carried	out	while	we	stay	here	at	hintock		
and	then	as	her	anxiety	increased	with	increasing	thought	there	returned	upon	her	mind	some	incidents	of	her	late	intercourse	with	him	which	she	had	heeded	but	little	at	the	time		
it	will	be	proved	by	my	future	conduct		
he	unhooked	a	darklantern	from	a	nail	under	the	eaves	and	she	did	not	notice	how	his	hand	shook	with	the	slight	strain	or	dream	that	in	making	this	offer	he	was	taxing	a	convalescence	which	could	ill	afford	such	selfsacrifice		
you	do	n't	wish	me	to	stay	any	longer		
if	we	continue	in	these	rooms	there	must	be	no	mixing	in	with	your	people	below		
later	on	when	that	planet	was	getting	command	of	the	upper	heaven	and	consequently	shining	with	an	unbroken	face	into	such	open	glades	as	there	were	in	the	neighborhood	of	the	hamlet	it	became	apparent	that	the	margin	of	the	wood	which	approached	the	timbermerchant	's	premises	was	not	to	be	left	to	the	customary	stillness	of	that	reposeful	time		
the	nature	of	her	errand	he	could	not	divine	but	he	was	prepared	to	give	her	any	amount	of	encouragement		
meanwhile	in	the	empty	house	from	which	the	guests	had	just	cleared	out	the	subject	of	their	discourse	was	walking	from	room	to	room	surveying	the	general	displacement	of	furniture	with	no	ecstatic	feeling	rather	the	reverse	indeed		
after	stating	how	extremely	glad	he	was	to	hear	that	she	was	better	and	able	to	get	outofdoors	he	went	on	this	is	a	wearisome	business	the	solicitor	we	have	come	to	see	being	out	of	town		
his	curious	and	altogether	alien	aspect	his	strange	gestures	like	those	of	one	who	is	rehearsing	a	scene	to	himself	and	the	unusual	place	and	hour	were	sufficient	to	account	for	any	trepidation	among	the	hintock	daughters	at	encountering	him		
as	grace	was	left	very	much	to	herself	she	took	advantage	of	one	fine	day	before	fitzpiers	's	return	to	drive	into	the	aforesaid	vale	where	stood	the	village	of	buckbury	fitzpiers		
fitzpiers	had	latterly	developed	an	irritable	discontent	which	vented	itself	in	monologues	when	grace	was	present	to	hear	them		
the	evening	after	leaving	her	he	went	out	into	the	lane	and	walked	and	pondered	between	the	high	hedges	now	greenishwhite	with	wild	clematishere	called	oldman	's	beard	from	its	aspect	later	in	the	year		
fitzpiers	did	not	require	to	be	told	twice		
the	thought	of	grammer	occurred	to	her		
do	n't	raft	yourself	without	good	need	george	she	replied		
if	you	do	n't	like	to	go	to	her	i	do	n't	wish	to	force	you		
melbury	and	his	daughter	drew	near	their	house	having	seen	but	one	living	thing	on	their	way	a	squirrel	which	did	not	run	up	its	tree	but	dropping	the	sweet	chestnut	which	it	carried	cried	chutchutchut	and	stamped	with	its	hind	legs	on	the	ground		
i	could	n't	have	surrounded	her	with	the	refinements	she	looked	for	anyhow	at	all		
she	is	not	at	all	well	he	said		
he	could	hardly	bear	to	see	his	whilom	truthful	girl	brought	to	the	humiliation	of	having	to	talk	like	that		
since	the	date	of	his	rejection	he	had	almost	grown	to	see	the	reasonableness	of	that	treatment		
there	was	no	sign	nor	sound	of	fitzpiers		
she	had	been	sadly	surprised	at	the	suddenness	of	his	distaste	for	those	oldfashioned	woodland	forms	of	life	which	in	his	courtship	he	had	professed	to	regard	with	so	much	interest		
from	this	ambiguous	expression	of	the	reticent	woodlander	's	dr.	fitzpiers	inferred	that	giles	disliked	miss	melbury	because	of	some	haughtiness	in	her	bearing	towards	him	and	had	on	that	account	withheld	her	name		
the	struggle	was	too	wearying	too	hopeless	while	she	remained		
the	gist	of	his	communication	was	that	mrs.	fitzpiers	should	be	assured	as	soon	as	possible	that	steps	were	being	taken	to	sever	the	bond	which	was	becoming	a	torture	to	her	that	she	would	soon	be	free	and	was	even	then	virtually	so		
he	wrote	briefly	and	unaffectedly	he	made	no	excuses	but	informed	her	that	he	was	living	quite	alone	and	had	been	led	to	think	that	they	ought	to	be	together	if	she	would	make	up	her	mind	to	forgive	him		
the	plantation	runs	up	into	a	corner	here	close	behind	the	house		
very	well	she	answered	stretching	one	hand	round	to	him	and	patting	her	eyes	with	a	handkerchief	held	in	the	other		
the	grateful	sense	of	his	kindness	stirred	her	to	action	though	she	only	knew	half	what	that	kindness	really	was		
the	question	had	been	mooted	between	them	before	and	she	was	not	unprepared	to	consider	it		
it	is	of	rather	more	importance	to	know	what	the	man	is	himself	than	what	his	family	is	she	said	if	he	is	going	to	practise	upon	us	as	a	surgeon		
yes	she	said	i	have	thought	that	too		
and	grace	proceeded	to	explain	mrs.	charmond	's	proposal	at	large		
the	rumor	which	agitated	the	other	folk	of	hintock	had	reached	the	young	girl	and	she	was	penning	a	letter	to	fitzpiers	to	tell	him	that	mrs.	charmond	wore	her	hair		
the	argument	continued	in	these	terms	till	a	voice	from	the	interior	of	the	carriage	inquired	what	was	the	matter		
she	knew	that	the	state	of	the	cottager	who	lived	that	way	was	a	mere	pretext	she	was	quite	sure	he	was	going	to	mrs.	charmond		
she	had	opened	the	window	with	a	faint	sense	of	triumph	but	he	had	turned	it	into	sadness	she	did	not	quite	comprehend	the	reason	why		
he	went	on	to	his	former	residence		
i	wo	n't	quite	believe	that	things	are	so	much	amiss		
while	he	ate	her	eyes	lingered	anxiously	on	his	face	following	its	every	movement	with	such	lovingkindness	as	only	a	fond	woman	can	show		
take	one	of	these	and	here	's	a	light		
he	threw	an	armful	of	last	year	's	leaves	on	to	the	fire	which	made	the	flame	leap	higher	and	the	encompassing	shades	to	weave	themselves	into	a	denser	contrast	turning	eve	into	night	in	a	moment		
he	informed	her	that	she	need	have	no	further	concern	about	fitzpiers	's	return	that	she	would	shortly	be	a	free	woman	and	therefore	if	she	should	desire	to	we	d	her	old	loverwhich	he	trusted	was	the	case	since	it	was	his	own	deep	wishshe	would	be	in	a	position	to	do	so		
his	manner	made	her	think	that	she	had	been	too	chiding	in	her	speech	and	a	mild	scarlet	wave	passed	over	her	as	she	resolved	to	soften	it		
forgive	me	but	i	ca	n't	rule	my	mourning	nohow	as	a	man	should	mr.	melbury	he	said		
fitzpiers	had	furnished	none	of	that	singleminded	confidence	and	truth	out	of	which	alone	such	a	second	union	could	spring	hence	it	was	with	a	controllable	emotion	that	she	now	watched	the	mare	brought	round		
this	increasing	complication	added	still	more	value	to	grace	in	the	surgeon	's	eyes	it	rendered	her	adorable		
she	murmured	her	dreamy	eyes	resting	on	the	swaying	tip	of	a	distant	tree		
the	gentleman	asked		
i	make	a	great	mistake	if	she	has	for	a	moment	thought	of	concealing	that	from	him		
will	you	delay	your	answer	till	some	time	hence	when	you	have	thoroughly	considered	since	i	fear	it	may	be	a	hasty	one	now		
if	i	could	   	not	get	a	pupilteachership	in	some	london	school	and	i	believe	i	   	could	by	advertising	i	could	stay	with	you	and	be	governess	to	   	georgina	and	myrtle	for	i	am	sure	you	can	not	spare	time	enough	to	   	teach	them	as	they	ought	to	be	taught	and	emmeline	is	not	old	enough	   	to	have	any	command	over	them		
though	he	is	your	brother	sir	i	must	say	this	that	i	would	rather	she	married	the	poorest	man	i	know		
at	about	the	midnight	hour	she	felt	more	fortified	on	the	expediency	of	marriage	with	lord	mountclere	than	she	had	done	at	all	since	musing	on	it		
one	wintry	afternoon	he	reached	the	doornow	for	the	third	timeand	gave	a	knock	which	had	in	it	every	tender	refinement	that	could	be	thrown	into	the	somewhat	antagonistic	vehicle	of	noise		
i	have	been	trying	at	knollsea	for	a	fortnight	and	it	is	no	use		
no	quite	the	reverse		
you	see	my	dear	berta	   	marriage	is	a	thing	which	once	carried	out	fixes	you	more	firm	in	a	   	position	than	any	personal	brains	can	do	for	as	you	stand	at	present	   	every	loose	tooth	and	every	combedout	hair	and	every	new	wrinkle	   	and	every	sleepless	night	is	so	much	took	away	from	your	chance	for	   	the	future	depending	as	it	do	upon	your	skill	in	charming		
now	how	do	you	think	this	bonnet	will	do		
ethelberta	did	everything	for	her	in	short	and	picotee	obeyed	orders	with	the	abstracted	ease	of	mind	which	people	show	who	have	their	thinking	done	for	them	and	put	out	their	troubles	as	they	do	their	washing		
o	no	no	there	is	nothing	like	that		
i	think	they	would	all	like	to	speak	to	you		
confound	the	clothes		
i	hardly	can	myself		
said	ethelberta		
i	thought	i	would	call	on	her	this	afternoon	but	when	i	got	there	i	found	she	had	left	early	for	the	performance		
the	result	of	this	change	was	soon	perceptible		
what	was	honest	in	enckworth	court	was	that	portion	of	the	original	edifice	which	still	remained	now	degraded	to	subservient	uses		
this	epistle	was	very	courteously	written	and	in	point	of	correctness	propriety	and	gravity	might	have	come	from	the	quill	of	a	bishop		
picotee	opened	the	door	and	said	with	an	anxiety	transcending	ethelberta	's	well		
a	tear	and	a	song		
he	watched	picotee	and	her	brother	off	the	premises	and	the	pair	went	on	their	way	towards	exonbury	crescent	very	few	words	passing	between	them		
i	wonder	if	she	has	deceived	him	in	anything	murmured	chickerel		
care	for	us	both	equally		
said	picotee	just	as	bitterly		
no	i	too	shall	go	to	the	church	first	just	to	assure	myself	said	chickerel		
are	you	the	parish	clerk		
upon	the	glazed	tiles	within	the	chimneypiece	were	the	forms	of	owls	bats	snakes	frogs	mice	spiders	in	their	webs	moles	and	other	objects	of	aversion	and	darkness	shaped	in	black	and	burnt	in	after	the	approved	fashion		
well	tis	a	fine	place		
i	wish	picotee	and	yourself	could	see	us	oftener	i	am	as	confirmed	a	bachelor	now	as	faith	is	an	old	maid		
if	it	were	true	added	ethelberta	smiling		
chickerel	mused	on	the	circumstance	as	he	took	his	ticket	and	got	into	the	train		
thank	you	said	sol		
they	parted	and	took	their	respective	places	lord	mountclere	choosing	a	compartment	next	to	the	one	ethelberta	was	entering	and	not	as	she	had	expected	attempting	to	join	her		
ah	yes	thank	you	said	christopher		
he	murmured		
yes	said	mr.	doncastle	in	a	low	tone		
menlove		
i	suppose	they	will	be	off	somewhere	and	she	is	busy	getting	ready		
autumn	had	begun	to	make	itself	felt	and	seen	in	bolder	and	less	subtle	ways	than	at	first		
when	we	have	put	joey	into	buttons	he	will	do	very	well	to	attend	to	the	door		
you	know	what	lady	's	face	served	as	the	original	to	this	i	suppose		
but	see	what	she	implied	to	me		
		
o	noi	think	you	will	be	mine	now		
ethelberta	and	lord	mountclere	looked	that	way	and	behold	picotee	had	nearly	swooned		
you	are	too	warm	about	it	kitit	can	not	be	so	bad	as	that		
the	question	is	how	long	shall	i	be	able	to	do	it		
leave	all	to	me		
the	shopfolk	be	out	of	stock	i	hear	and	the	visiting	lady	up	the	hill	is	terribly	in	want	of	clothes	so	tis	said		
it	contained	these	words	only	in	a	scrawl	so	full	of	deformities	that	she	could	hardly	piece	its	meaning	together	   	i	must	see	you	again	today	unless	you	absolutely	deny	yourself	to	   	me	which	i	shall	take	as	a	refusal	to	meet	me	any	more		
		
the	approach	was	like	a	turnpike	road	full	of	great	ruts	clumsy	mendings	bordered	by	trampled	edges	and	incursions	upon	the	grass	at	pleasure		
it	became	evident	to	all	the	family	that	some	misunderstanding	had	arisen	between	ethelberta	and	mr.	julian		
never	mind	it	said	christopher	a	sense	of	the	true	state	of	her	case	dawning	upon	him	with	unpleasant	distinctness	and	bringing	some	irritation	at	his	awkward	position	though	it	was	impossible	to	be	long	angry	with	a	girl	who	had	not	reasoning	foresight	enough	to	perceive	that	doubtful	pleasure	and	certain	pain	must	be	the	result	of	any	meeting	whilst	hearts	were	at	cross	purposes	in	this	way		
but	their	sister	had	other	lines	laid	down	for	them	than	those	of	level	progress	to	start	them	some	day	as	masters	instead	of	men	was	a	longcherished	wish	of	ethelberta	's		
so	though	i	do	n't	mean	to	be	   	harsh	i	must	impress	upon	you	the	necessity	of	going	on	as	you	are	   	going	just	at	present		
the	occasion	the	place	and	their	own	condition	made	them	kin		
said	neigh	noticing	an	abstraction	in	his	companion		
christopher	had	now	a	far	better	opportunity	than	before	for	observing	ethelberta	's	betrothed		
i	do	n't	like	it		
but	melancholy	and	mistaken	thoughts	of	herself	as	a	counterfeit	had	brought	her	to	this		
i	do	notyou	did	not	blench		
no	sooner	had	picotee	left	her	sister	's	room	than	ethelberta	thought	it	would	after	all	have	been	much	better	if	she	had	gone	down	herself	to	speak	to	this	admirably	persistent	lover		
no	christopher	really	you	did	not		
he	bowed	and	walked	out	awkwardly		
it	is	said	cornelia		
he	entered	and	sat	down	beside	mountclere	not	without	a	sense	that	he	was	spoiling	good	upholstery	the	coachman	then	allowed	the	lash	of	his	whip	to	alight	with	the	force	of	a	small	fly	upon	the	horses	which	set	them	up	in	an	angry	trot		
there	do	n't	spoil	your	eyes	you	may	have	to	sell	them		
and	so	she	told	him	said	ladywell		
37		
i	wish	captain	strong	to	bring	the	fawn	round	into	knollsea	bay		
say	shall	it	be	here	or	where	they	are	standing		
christopher	parted	from	his	companion	and	soon	reached	a	stile	clambering	over	which	he	entered	a	park		
what	man	was	that		
she	spoke	in	a	settled	way	as	if	something	intended	had	been	set	in	train	and	christopher	having	promised	for	his	sister	he	went	out	of	the	house	with	a	parting	smile	of	misgiving		
lord	mountclere	is	to	be	married	to	mrs.	petherwin	quite	privately		
when	the	hour	drew	nigh	enormous	force	of	will	was	required	to	keep	her	perturbation	down		
since	the	matter	has	been	mentioned	said	mr.	jones	i	may	say	that	i	too	noticed	the	singularity	of	it		
i	'll	tell	somebody	downstairs	of	you	who	'll	soon	see	about	it		
i	do	n't	like	my	relations	being	my	servants	but	if	they	did	not	work	for	me	they	would	have	to	work	for	others	and	my	service	is	much	lighter	and	pleasanter	than	any	other	lady	's	would	be	for	them	so	the	advantages	are	worth	the	risk		
some	disclosure	or	reference	to	me	otherwise	than	as	your	mistress	will	certainly	be	made	else	and	then	i	am	ruined
