on	a	tissuethin	monotone	of	bluegrey	buds	    	two	bluegrey	birds	chasing	a	third	    	at	full	cry		
who	shall	hear	of	us	    	in	the	time	to	come		
now	we	are	crowned		
what	do	i	care		
let	them	cause	you	to	think	well	then	of	the	storms	    	that	drive	many	to	shelter		
come	downjoin	me	    	for	i	am	lonely		
in	fact	    	that	’s	no	place	  	at	all	for	him	    	up	there	  	unceremoniously	    	dragging	our	friend	out	  	to	his	own	dignity		
this	is	fortunate	for	they	would	    	burn	you	to	an	ash	otherwise		
ah		
these	things	    	astonish	me	beyond	words		
the	gift	of	some	endures	    	ten	years	the	gift	of	some	twenty	    	and	the	gift	of	some	for	the	time	a	    	great	house	rots	and	is	torn	down		
i	worn	against	    	the	years	        	v.	    	but	it	is	five	o’clock		
she	is	attiring	herself	before	me	    	taking	shape	before	me	for	worship	    	a	red	leaf	that	falls	upon	a	stone		
observe	    	how	motionless	    	the	eaten	moon	    	lies	in	the	protecting	lines		
no		
give	them	the	slip	then	    	let	them	sit	in	you	    	soil	their	pants	    	teach	them	a	dignity	    	that	is	dignity	the	dignity	    	of	mud		
it	is	i	holds	you	    	half	against	the	sky	    	half	against	a	black	tree	trunk	    	icily	resplendent		
iii		
and	the	next	thing	i	say	is	this	    	i	saw	an	eagle	once	circling	against	the	clouds	    	over	one	of	our	principal	churches	    	easter	it	wasa	beautiful	day	    	three	gulls	came	from	above	the	river	    	and	crossed	slowly	seaward

a	wind	might	blow	a	lotus	petal	    	over	the	pyramidsbut	not	this	wind		
as	best	as	she	can	    	she	hides	herself	    	in	the	full	sunlight	    	her	cordy	legs	writhing	    	beneath	the	little	flowered	dress	    	that	leaves	them	bare	    	from	midthigh	to	ankle	    	why	has	she	chosen	me	    	for	the	knife	    	that	darts	along	her	smile		
i	come	here	to	mingle	faiance	dug	    	from	the	tomb	turquoise	colored	    	necklaces	and	belched	wind	from	the	    	stomach	delicately	veined	basins	    	of	agate	cracked	and	discolored	and	    	the	stink	of	stale	urine

see	it	splash		
dawn	    	ecstatic	bird	songs	pound	    	the	hollow	vastness	of	the	sky	    	with	metallic	clinkings	    	beating	color	up	into	it	    	at	a	far	edge	beating	it	beating	it	    	with	rising	triumphant	ardor	    	stirring	it	into	warmth	    	quickening	in	it	a	spreading	change	    	bursting	wildly	against	it	as	    	dividing	the	horizon	a	heavy	sun	    	lifts	himselfis	lifted	    	bit	by	bit	above	the	edge	    	of	things	runs	free	at	last	    	out	into	the	open		
these	are	shining	topics	    	my	townspeople	but	    	hardly	of	great	moment		
i	went	into	the	city	    	out	again	baffled	onto	the	mountain

and	she	waved	me	    	from	the	white	wet	in	midst	of	her	playing		
that	’s	all	i	care	for	now		
it	is	true	    	in	the	light	colors	    	of	morning	    	brownstone	and	slate	    	shine	orange	and	dark	blue
