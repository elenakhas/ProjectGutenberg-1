lend	a	hand	here	a	trio	came	forward	and	hoisted	the	crate	out	of	the	ship		
only	the	russians	denied	it		
they	came	here	for	some	kind	of	conference	i	guess		
the	senator	thinks	that	if	we	do	n't	agree	they	might	do	something	drastic	like	blow	us	all	up		
she	looked	at	him	with	exasperation	and	then	gathered	up	a	stack	of	memorandums	and	letters	his	own	envelope	atop	it		
that	's	the	big	point		
the	only	hitch	is	russia	does	n't	want	to	wait	that	long	and	is	asking	for	a	hurryup	summit	meeting	to	make	a	decision		
there	is	a	hatch	which	may	be	opened	by	an	automatic	lever	in	the	side		
they	were	in	his	apartment	and	it	was	the	first	time	greta	had	consented	to	pay	him	the	visit		
greta	you	'll	have	to	excuse	me		
do	n't	you	ever	think	of	anything	else		
anyway	i	'll	probably	lose	my	job	and	then	you	wo	n't	have	any	use	for	me		
when	will	that	be		
a	crate	colligan		
you	're	taking	it	mighty	calm	he	said	ironically		
he	circled	the	ship	warily	and	then	said	something	to	the	others		
five	minutes	later	jerry	bridges	was	calling	the	airlines		
where	will	you	be	when	the	big	mushroom	cloud	comes		
but	jerry	was	impatient	to	get	to	the	point	of	his	visit	and	he	blurted	out	professor	coltz	something	's	been	bothering	me		
it	's	an	instruction	book	he	whispered		
jerry	held	his	breath	as	they	approached	the	object	only	when	they	were	yards	away	did	he	appreciate	its	size		
i	come	in	the	belief	that	peace	is	the	responsibility	of	individuals	of	nations	and	now	of	worlds	and	that	each	is	dependent	upon	the	other		
oh	i	guess	that	was	after	your	time	was	n't	it		
in	an	hour		
they	had	done	a	good	job	of	keeping	the	excitement	contained		
well	how	else	can	i	take	it		
on	the	perimeter	official	vehicles	were	parked	in	orderly	rows	and	four	usaf	trailer	trucks	were	in	evidence	their	radarscopes	turning	slowly		
a	door	slid	open		
but	still	greta	snuggled	up	to	him	on	the	sofa		
when	the	door	was	opened	the	delegate	was	an	exploded	ruin		
it	's	a	spaceship		
i	thought	of	you	only	yesterday	when	i	saw	your	name	in	the	papers	they	sat	at	facing	student	desks	and	chatted	about	old	times		
unstoppable	inexorable	it	may	return	bearing	a	different	delegate	from	venusa	delegate	of	death	who	speaks	not	in	words	but	in	the	explosion	of	atoms		
meanwhile	consider	yourself	in	custody		
but	if	you	print	one	word	of	it	jerry	bridges	i	'll	never	speak	to	you	again		
the	desert	sky	was	cloudy	and	starless	and	powerful	searchlights	probed	the	thick	cumulus		
but	envision	it	men	of	earth	as	a	messenger	of	war		
i	guess	there	's	no	use	fighting	it		
there	were	sleek	purring	black	autos	waiting	to	rush	the	air	passengers	to	some	unnamed	destination		
it	was	remarkable	how	little	had	changed	but	the	students	seemed	incredibly	young		
but	to	use	me	just	to	get	a	story	but	i	'm	a	reporter	damn	it		
in	a	secluded	booth	at	the	rear	of	a	restaurant	unfrequented	by	newsmen	greta	leaned	forward	and	said	at	first	they	thought	it	was	another	sputnik		
do	n't	thank	me	i	'm	not	doing	you	any	personal	favor		
his	secretary	however	was	a	little	more	obliging	jerry	looked	up	from	his	coffee	and	blinked	when	he	saw	who	was	coming	through	the	door	of	the	bar	grill		
she	came	out	of	the	press	secretary	's	office	two	minutes	later	with	howells	himself	and	howells	said	you	there	bridges		
but	you	know	you	're	a	liar	sometimes	jerry		
you	've	got	some	mail	right	there		
and	you	promise	not	to	print	it		
first	remove	all	parts	and	arrange	them	in	the	following	order		
they	drove	for	twenty	minutes	across	a	flat	ribbon	of	desert	road	until	jerry	sighted	what	appeared	to	be	a	circle	of	newlyerected	lights	in	the	middle	of	nowhere		
it	had	been	eleven	years	since	jerry	had	walked	across	the	campus	of	clifton	university	heading	for	the	ivychoked	main	building		
there	was	something	about	the	robot	's	speech	that	sounded	familiari	could	have	sworn	i	'd	heard	some	of	the	words	before		
i	think	you	're	wonderful		
what	are	they		
he	took	a	small	table	in	the	rear	and	ate	his	meal	in	sullen	silence		
they	carried	geiger	counters	on	long	poles	before	them		
i	suppose	you	wo	n't	want	to	see	me	any	more		
but	his	sudden	celebrity	left	him	vaguely	unsatisfied		
you	mean	these	venusians	speak	english		
what		
if	the	students	looked	younger	professor	coltz	was	far	older	than	jerry	remembered		
he	was	allowed	to	leave	the	car	and	stroll	unescorted		
i	've	noticed	that	about	you		
i	could	n't	prove	anything	until	i	checked	my	old	notes	and	here	's	what	i	found		
when	it	hit	a	dust	cloud	obscured	it	from	sight		
you	do	n't	understand	about	last	night		
from	a	debris	of	cardboard	boxes	he	found	a	worn	old	leather	brief	case	and	cackled	with	delight	when	he	found	the	yellowed	notebooks	inside		
stillness	returned	to	the	desert	and	tension	was	a	tangible	substance	in	the	night	air		
finally	a	threeman	team	asbestosclad	leadshielded	stepped	out	from	the	ring	of	spectators		
as	the	minutes	ticked	off	the	activity	became	more	frenetic	around	him		
i	'm	not	even	supposed	to	know	about	it	except	that	the	senator	is	so	careless	about	she	put	her	fingers	to	her	lips		
he	ran	after	her	the	restaurant	proprietor	shouting	about	the	unpaid	bill		
you	do	n't	understand	lana	he	said		
professor	coltz		
but	there	's	something	i	've	got	to	do	right	away		
he	was	a	tall	man	with	an	unruly	confusion	of	straight	gray	hair		
and	french		
you	mean	to	tell	me	there	's	another	of	those	metal	moons	up	there		
think	of	thousands	of	such	delegates	fired	from	a	vantage	point	far	beyond	the	reach	of	your	retaliation		
i	'm	just	doing	my	job	i	think	the	public	has	a	right	to	know	about	this	spaceship	that	's	flying	around	       	his	words	brought	an	exclamation	from	the	others		
the	news	flashed	with	lightning	speed	over	the	world	and	jerry	bridges	eyewitness	accounts	of	the	incredible	event	was	syndicated	throughout	the	nation		
the	radarscopes	spun	slowly		
it	was	n't	the	way	that	lousy	columnist	said	she	stopped	in	her	tracks		
he	could	n't	do	anything	about	smuggling	you	aboard		
the	effects	of	earth	's	gravitational	pull	on	the	body	versus	the	relatively	light	gravitation	encountered	by	the	members	of	the	martian	colony	twofifths	the	pull	of	earth	interesting	speculation	on	the	heart	action		
how	about	roth		
but	it	's	impossible		
he	smiled	mantoman		
which	is	maybe	understandable	because	he	's	got	a	wife	that	is	absolutely	skip	that	junk	said	garcia	toughly		
he	could	supply	all	the	money	bill	would	need		
monk	read	the	headline	aloud	and	then	looked	at	rostov		
with	a	deafening	roar	of	its	rocket	motors	the	great	vessel	lifted	itself	laboriously	from	the	ground	squatting	on	flame	filling	fletcher	monk	's	mind	with	the	first	real	sense	of	fear	since	he	learned	the	grim	facts	of	his	ailment	in	rostov	's	office		
at	least	there	's	a	chance	the	doctor	argued		
that	's	okay	mr.	wheeler		
but	i	'll	find	it		
i	've	just	had	a	little	conversation	with	your	official	greeter		
money	does	n't	buy	health		
how	do	you	know		
only	from	what	i	heard	around	the	base	she	's	a	groundworm	's	delight	if	you	know	what	i	mean	i	do	n't	know	what	you	mean	said	monk	patiently		
i	'll	keep	it	in	mind	he	said		
he	helped	draft	the	original	physical	standards	for	space	flight		
a	powerful	piece	of	persuasion		
monk		
breathe	deeply	and	regularly	on	the	way	up		
your	heart	action	is	unreliable	and	no	amount	of	dollars	can	bring	it	back	to	normal	the	industrialist	stood	up		
do	the	same	thinghold	your	breath	when	we	start	accelerating	once	more		
it	's	working	on	will	power	mr.	monk	hardly	anything	else		
o.k.	doc	he	said		
he	would	n't	do	it	he	could	n't		
here	's	my	answer	you	gloomy	old	fool		
your	chances	are	slim		
he	blinked		
you	're	telling	me		
listen	bud		
mr.	monk	you	do	n't	know	what	i	'm	telling	you		
monk	froze		
i	understand	monk	nodded		
we	can	buy	or	sell	this	place	at	the	drop	of	a	quotation		
in	case	you	did	n't	realize	it	i	'm	in	a	position	to	exert	a	great	deal	of	influence	over	your	little	colonyand	do	n't	think	i	wo	n't	use	it		
the	boss	wants	facts		
what	do	you	mean		
we	'll	give	you	a	mild	sedative	before	blastoff		
said	monk	in	horror		
that	is	the	point	rostov	said	stiffly		
dr.	feasley	never	made	such	a	bald	statement		
and	of	course	finally	with	her	cool	arms	about	his	neck	and	her	soft	cheek	pressed	against	his	he	replied	i	'll	do	it		
pretty	old	for	the	colony	are	n't	you	mr.		
what	do	you	mean		
i	suppose	so		
now	let	's	go		
go	on		
but	you	could	show	some	reaction		
it	buys	friends	and	sells	enemies		
and	the	first	thing	i	'm	going	to	arrange	is	the	loss	of	some	weight		
you	know	what	i	'm	talking	about	mr.	moore		
no	no		
we	'll	go	rapidly	from	zero	gravity	to	nine		
who	's	your	commanding	officer		
but	i	would	expect	a	little	common	courtesy	you	'll	earn	the	right	to	courtesy	out	here	mr.	monk	the	captain	snapped		
that	's	what	we	call	the	space	station		
he	looked	up	at	monk	curiously		
you	'll	sing	a	different	tune	when	i	tell	you	how	much	is	in	this	bag		
if	what	people	said	about	dr.	forsch	was	true	he	might	be	approached		
i	could	curdle	your	milk	by	telling	you	some	of	the	things	i	've	fixed	with	money		
the	best	thing	for	you	the	doctor	continued	is	to	start	slowing	downright	now	today		
monk	gasped		
he	's	the	dispatch	officer		
you	think	the	heart	is	incorruptible	eh		
said	monk		
a	slim	one	surely		
he	must	help	her	he	must	give	her	poor	sick	uncle	a	chance	to	make	a	new	life	for	himself	in	the	mars	colony		
what		
he	smiled	humorlessly	at	horner		
a	real	beauty		
thoughtfully	he	reached	inside	his	coat	and	brought	out	a	long	black	cigar		
i	do	n't	quite	get	your	meaning	captain	he	said	indignantly		
crusty	old	guy		
ben	wheeler		
monk	rattled	the	paper		
the	assignment	was	the	kind	that	garcia	both	understood	and	relished		
the	bird	was	gone		
i	do	n't	expect	you	to	cheer	said	monk	sarcastically		
when	the	detectives	handed	fletcher	monk	the	completed	report	on	the	activities	of	diana	christy	he	read	it	through	thoroughly	savoring	each	juicy	word	between	puffs	of	his	cigar		
not	the	problem	of	acceleration		
i	realize	that	of	course	said	the	industrialist		
my	name	is	monk		
come	on		
breakfast	in	ten	minutes	she	said	cheerfully		
dream	about	it	every	night		
mom	was	busy	at	the	stove		
good	idea	dawes	nodded		
he	followed	lamely	behind	the	two	men	as	they	went	out	into	the	street	again		
my	name	's	dawes		
he	was	promised	nothing	and	told	to	stay	in	town	until	he	was	contacted	again	by	the	authorities		
that	woman	back	there		
are	you		
and	you	prince	regent		
he	read	sally	's	copy	of	treasure	island	for	about	half	an	hour		
yes		
you	goin'	to	stay	with	us		
i	'm	goin'	to	the	palace	again	too		
his	clothes	were	a	mess	and	he	needed	a	shave		
fred	did	n't	seem	to	be	half	as	sorry	as	he	was		
do	you	dream	about	the	place	too		
he	looked	sheepishly	at	the	stranger		
will	you	please	go	away		
sol	laughed	feebly		
i	'm	not	naked		
and	your	husband		
a	fat	man	looked	up	from	behind	a	desk		
he	was	flanked	by	marble	pillars	thrusting	towards	a	highdomed	ceiling		
the	fat	man	grunted	and	hoisted	himself	out	of	the	swivel	chair		
he	's	just	too	dern	fat	to	do	much	more'n	sit	on	a	throne	and	eat	grapes		
armagon	dawes	corrected		
mom	called		
dunno	sally	shrugged		
he	seemed	okay		
finally	he	got	his	call	through	to	salinas	and	a	sleepyvoiced	fred	his	old	army	buddy	listened	somewhat	indifferently	to	his	tale	of	woe		
you	ai	n't	a	reporter		
the	tableau	was	grisly		
he	removed	his	drenched	coat	and	suit	jacket	and	squeezed	water	out	over	the	ashes		
the	fat	man	chuckled		
he	murmured	something	about	the	troopers	and	shuffled	alongside	the	puffing	fat	man		
enjoyed	it	last	night		
yeah		
gold	letters	on	the	glass	advertised	haircut	shave	massage	parlor		
after	the	meal	they	spent	a	quiet	evening	at	home		
aw	willie	well	come	on		
he	glanced	at	the	evening	paper	and	then	spoke	to	sol		
do	you	got	a	girlfriend	mister		
have	you	ever	heard	of	armagon		
hey	ma		
i	mean	is	it		
writing	it	up	i	mean		
you	heard	the	charges		
he	knows	the	place	better	than	anybody		
now	now	dawes	said	gently		
thought	you	me	and	charlie	would	get	brundage	's	body	outa	the	house		
his	reflection	in	the	mirror	strangely	gray	in	the	dim	light	made	him	groan		
of	course		
and	you	mr.	sol	turned	to	the	fat	man		
stir	that	fat	carcass		
goodnight	young	man	mom	said	firmly		
i	'm	not	going	to	do	anything	until	you	get	out	of	here		
the	rain	had	stopped	but	the	heavy	clouds	seemed	reluctant	to	leave	the	skies	over	the	small	town		
sol	nodded	embarrassed		
fresh	tears	resulted		
boy	you	shoulda	seen	the	exelution		
sure	sally	piped		
in	the	hallway		
thought	so		
he	said	good	morning		
if	you	let	me	get	dressed	i	'll	show	you	how	to	take	your	thumb	off		
this	here	's	mr.	becker	he	got	another	problem		
do	n't	expect	mr.	becker	knows	anything	about	armagon		
dawes	was	n't	amused		
he	tried	for	fifteen	minutes	to	get	through	but	there	was	a	woman	on	the	line	who	was	terribly	upset	about	a	cotton	dress	she	had	ordered	from	sears	and	was	telling	the	world	about	it		
the	sheriff	followed	the	trio	up	with	a	sad	undertaker	expression		
about	my	car	the	sheriff	turned	and	regarded	him	lugubriously		
sol	repeated	the	question		
dawes	suspicious	attitude	then	sleep	came		
they	have	n't	found	my	car	yet		
three	old	men	took	their	places	on	the	bench	that	circled	the	general	and	leaned	on	their	canes		
you	let	mr.	becker	alone	and	go	wash		
mom	pecked	him	lightly	on	the	forehead		
you	better	stay	out	of	this	the	sheriff	warned		
if	you	do	n't	mind		
you	leave	the	gentleman	alone		
you	eat	up	young	man
