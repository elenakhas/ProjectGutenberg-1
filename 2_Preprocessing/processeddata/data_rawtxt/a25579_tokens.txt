everyone	who	owned	stock	in	robling	titanium	was	automatically	a	member	of	the	board	of	directors	with	torkleson	as	chairman	of	the	board		
for	new	contracts		
and	what	stock	more	logical	to	buy	than	stock	in	their	own	companies		
just	let	you	have	a	free	hand	to	rob	us	blind	again		
it	had	meant	something	to	be	vice	president	of	a	huge	industrial	firm	like	robling	titanium		
yes	it	was	an	unprecedented	action		
tomatoes	were	hurled	fists	were	shaken	but	the	copter	remained		
walter	rose	slowly	from	his	seat		
lock	them	into	reverberating	circuits	with	a	code	sequence	key		
walk	out	in	front	of	those	men	after	what	you	've	done		
he	picked	them	up	warily		
no	more	private	goldplated	buicks	for	you	boys		
i	do	n't	think	so		
i	've	warned	you	time	and	again		
tomorrow	we	work	as	usual	until	the	noon	whistle		
did	they	get	them	fixed		
the	stockholders	numbered	over	ten	thousand		
so	we	ca	n't	be	sure	of	the	legal	end		
his	honor	turned	to	jeff	bates		
the	third	day	jeff	bates	was	served	with	an	injunction	ordering	towne	to	return	to	work		
right	now	they	want	those	machines	going	again		
and	the	key	is	our	secret		
they	could	go	on	strike		
they	own	the	stock	stock	is	supposed	to	pay	dividends		
i	'm	production	manager	of	the	corporation		
are	you	counsel	for	the	defendant		
wait	until	i	get	o'gilvy	on	the	phone		
he	'll	never	go	along		
mr.	bates	if	you	plead	guilty	you	leave	me	no	alternative	but	to	send	me	to	jail	said	walter	towne		
bailey	was	putting	down	the	visiphone	receiver		
they	sat	in	darkness	hardly	daring	to	breathe		
there	was	one	program	that	had	n't	been	coded	into	the	machines	yet		
i	give	you	your	man		
the	union	boss	's	office	was	crowded	with	tv	cameras	newsmen	and	puzzled	workmen		
all	he	'd	need	to	do	is	ask	for	managers	and	a	dozen	companies	would	throw	them	to	him	on	loan		
deduct	union	dues	pension	fees	medical	insurance	fees	and	sundry	other	little	items	which	had	formerly	been	paid	by	welltodo	managements	and	very	little	was	left	but	the	semiannual	dividend	checks		
the	workers	came	to	the	plants	in	business	suits	it	was	true	and	lounged	in	the	finest	of	lounges	and	read	the	wall	street	journal	and	felt	like	stockholders		
they	've	got	their	own	management	troubles		
they	were	packed	in	from	the	wall	to	the	stage	and	hanging	from	the	rafters		
torkleson	was	waiting	to	see	the	shop	steward	when	he	came	in	next	morning		
we	appeal	to	the	spirit	of	orderly	justice	walter	yawned	as	the	words	went	on		
before	we	leave	we	throw	the	machines	into	feedback	every	one	of	them		
he	'd	had	more	freedom	this	last	month	than	before	maybe	there	'd	been	a	policy	change		
perhaps	we	were	a	little	demanding	i	concede	it		
then	somebody	appeared	with	a	rope		
not	quite		
i	still	do	n't	see	how	we	could	work	it	hendricks	objected		
they	may	have	you	in	jail	if	you	do	start	them	too	but	that	's	another	bridge		
i	've	been	doing	everything	i	could	walter	snapped		
they	'll	have	you	in	jail	if	you	do	n't	start	the	machines	again		
then	we	just	do	n't	come	back		
torkleson	snorted		
bailey	shook	his	head		
but	if	you	want	to	commit	suicide	that	's	all	right	with	me		
i	'm	not	an	unreasonable	man	torkleson	was	saying	miserably	waving	his	fat	paws	in	the	air	as	he	paced	back	and	forth	in	front	of	the	spokesmen	for	the	striking	managers		
just	a	minor	item	but	it	's	a	starter		
what	about	the	production	lines		
until	shop	steward	bailey	suddenly	found	himself	in	charge	of	a	dozen	sputtering	machines	and	an	empty	office		
helpless		
we	fought	long	and	hard	for	control	of	this	corporation	just	the	way	all	the	other	unions	did		
there	just	has	n't	been	a	case	of	a	company	's	management	striking	against	its	own	labor		
the	meeting	was	held	in	a	huge	auditorium	in	the	robling	administration	building		
the	union	lawyer	dropped	his	glasses	on	the	table	with	a	crash		
his	grin	spread	unpleasantly	from	ear	to	ear		
more	men	clambered	up	on	the	stage	shouting	and	shaking	their	fists		
now	look	bailey	we	've	always	worked	well	together		
i	do	n't	care	how	the	dividends	come	in		
even	at	the	cost	of	lowering	dividends	of	taking	food	from	the	mouths	of	your	wives	and	children	we	made	our	generous	offers		
the	workers	grew	restive		
an	idea	began	to	form	in	his	head		
walter	closed	his	eyes	with	a	little	smile	as	the	charges	were	read	breach	of	contract	malicious	mischief	sabotage	of	the	company	's	machines	conspiring	to	destroy	the	livelihood	of	ten	thousand	workers		
big	orders	canceled		
no	plant	can	keep	up	production	the	way	the	men	are	working		
pendleton	sighed		
it	's	ridiculous	the	lawyer	spluttered	staring	at	the	circle	of	men	in	the	room		
the	workers	are	putting	pressure	on	him		
not	while	i	'm	secretary	of	this	union		
we	'll	see	said	walter		
the	boss	wants	to	see	you		
get	me	walter	towne	he	said		
he	pointed	to	towne	with	a	flourish		
there	was	a	hurried	conference		
practically	had	the	machines	apart	on	the	floor		
the	jet	would	bring	him	down	in	las	vegas	in	exactly	the	same	time	to	the	second	either	way		
you	're	needed		
a	deep	breath	from	mckenzie	like	a	sigh	of	relief		
garbage	said	dan	fowler	succinctly		
cut	out	my	tongue	carl	but	i	'm	selling		
great	book	for	soulsearching	senators		
dan	fowler	sat	greyfaced	staring	at	paul	just	shaking	his	head	and	staring		
maybebut	i	do	n't	think	so		
well	it	was	crude	then	moss	said		
have	you	talked	to	them	over	there		
you	'll	have	to	be	my	ears	and	cover	for	me		
they	know	what	's	going	on		
of	rejuvenation		
but	you	're	not	on	it		
peter	golden	's	widow	is	n't		
i	did	n't	know	you	hated	me	so	much		
i	had	dreams	in	those	days		
he	threw	it	out	violently	his	heart	sinking		
i	think	you	'll	be	interested		
even	now	a	dozen	men	were	scampering	around	the	scaffolding	before	dan	's	incredulous	eyes	and	he	saw	some	of	the	beaming	coming	off	the	body	of	the	ship	being	dropped	onto	the	crane	moving	slowly	to	the	ground		
that	god	damned	rinehart	is	enough	to	make	anybody	black	out		
and	meanwhile	keep	your	eye	on	the	teevies		
and	there	was	in	a	sense	frantic	activity	noise	hubbub	hard	work	fancy	plansall	going	nowhere		
carl	was	shaking	his	head	sadly		
jesus	dan		
paul	has	always	been	fussy	about	telling	the	truth		
these	are	my	own		
why	not	paul	looked	across	at	him	for	a	long	moment		
the	admen	and	the	insurance	people	were	n't	too	concerned	about	man	's	immortal	soulthey'd	take	their	share	now	thanksbut	this	did	n't	bother	tyndall	too	much		
could		
it	's	nothing		
it	had	been	different	years	ago		
and	if	you	give	him	another	ten	years	he	'll	have	it	done	by	god		
washed	up	finished	thanks	to	you		
and	once	or	twice	you	've	blacked	clean	out	for	a	while	and	made	your	staff	work	like	demons	to	cover	for	you	and	keep	it	off	the	teevies	right		
disease	the	enemy	was	crushed		
and	every	minute	you	stand	there	with	your	jaw	sagging	just	tells	rinehart	how	tight	he	's	got	youdo	something	anything	there	was	a	way		
maybe	cleveland		
but	they	say	he	had	to	have	special	drugs	every	night	that	he	had	changed		
paul	maneuvered	a	midget	loading	crane	guided	the	thing	into	launching	position	on	the	floor	then	turned	back	to	dan		
how	do	i	know	you	wo	n't	break	it	anyway		
there	was	also	hatred	there	and	victory	long	awaited	bitterly	won		
really		
great	for	the	stomach	but	there	was	n't	time	to	stop		
not	now		
he	just	stared		
ii	ca	n't	do	it	dan		
nothing	of	the	sort		
a	tiny	bird	of	a	manthree	times	rejuvenated	and	still	the	mind	was	sharp	the	eyes	were	sharp		
then	i	'll	also	announce	a	feature	attraction	that	the	people	can	look	forward	to	when	the	hearing	date	comes		
surebut	you	were	right	they	did	n't	like	it		
he	smiled	sadly	across	at	his	brother		
oh	i	know	you	're	right	doc		
okay	if	you	say	so		
have	a	drink		
other	things	were	stalling	all	the	while		
no	dan		
tell	me	what		
you	'd	better	tackle	the	admen	then		
we	've	got	the	story	on	peter	golden		
dan	snorted		
the	ninth	was	under	contract	of	coursestrictly	a	potboiler	i	'm	afraid		
dammit	man	are	you	blind	and	deaf		
try	to	sleep		
well	i	'm	certainly	glad	to	hear	that		
oh	no	doubt	you	could		
my	card	is	on	top		
worried	lines	deepened	on	golden	's	forehead		
he	shook	his	head	helplessly	groping	for	words		
it	's	life	paul		
nobody	knows	that	ship	like	you	do	you	're	making	it	go		
starship	project	is	dying		
but	such	a	lot	of	trouble	for	an	unwilling	victim		
the	door	clicked	shut	with	a	note	of	finality	and	dr.	david	moss	stared	at	it	gloomily		
iunderstand		
the	man	is	fanatic	of	course	but	with	his	plans	he	could	actually	be	producing	in	another	five	years		
your	brother	refused	it		
everything	's	fine		
dan	did	n't	answer		
when	i	get	through	with	mckenzie	i	may	be	leaving	the	country	for	a	while		
who	wants	engineers		
he	gulped	the	last	of	the	coffee		
the	blueprints	have	n't	got	a	flaw	in	them		
tom	grinned	tiredly	his	eyes	far	away		
the	life	of	david	ingersoll		
shandor	stared		
ingersoll	was	one	man	the	people	could	trust		
i	do	n't	get	it	he	said	dully		
shandor	stared	at	her		
suddenly	he	galvanized	into	action		
shandor	stumbled	to	a	chair	sat	down	woodenly		
we	've	been	puppets	on	strings	and	one	man	engineered	it	from	the	very	start		
shandor	's	face	was	deathly	white		
but	if	that	conference	fails	we	're	in	fullscale	war		
motors	and	materials	all	for	arizonasomething	caught	his	mind	brought	a	frown	to	his	large	bland	face	some	offkey	note	in	the	monstrous	symphony	of	production	and	intrigue	that	threw	up	a	red	flag	in	his	mind	screamed	for	attention	and	then	he	sipped	the	fresh	coffee	at	his	elbow	and	sighed	and	looked	up	at	the	girl	standing	there	saw	her	hand	tremble	as	she	steadied	herself	against	the	desk	and	sat	down	beside	him		
shandor	's	voice	cut	sharply	through	the	room		
it	wo	n't	do	you	any	good	to	be	here	if	the	earth	is	blasted	to	bits		
shandor	frowned	a	snag	in	the	chain	drawing	his	attention		
that	's	the	truthwhy	not	tell	that	to	the	people		
munitions	people	mostly		
name	anybody	in	the	current	administration		
i	never	meant	anything	more	in	my	life		
i	did	n't	think	there	was	anybody	left	like	that	she	said		
i	also	know	that	most	of	your	writing	while	you	were	doing	public	information	board	work	was	never	ordered	by	pib		
where	are	they		
shandor	growled	angrily	surveying	the	pile	of	notes	with	a	sinking	feeling	of	incredulity		
mile	upon	mile	of	jagged	rocky	crags	black	rock	ageless	unaged	rock		
i	need	some	help	badly		
i	'm	sorry		
shandor	flushed	angrily		
how	about	it	mariel		
he	whispered		
educated	at	rutgers	university	and	mit		
washington	dc	was	badly	hit	as	were	new	york	and	philadelphia	and	further	raids	are	expected	to	originate	from	siberia	coming	across	the	great	circle	to	the	west	coast	or	the	middle	west		
a	second	blow	from	the	side	caught	him	solidly	in	the	blackness	grunting	flailing	out	into	a	tangle	of	legs	and	arms	cursing	catching	a	foot	in	his	face	striking	up	into	soft	yielding	flesh	and	his	head	suddenly	exploded	into	a	million	dazzling	lights	as	he	sank	unconscious	to	the	ground	       	it	was	a	tiny	room	completely	without	windows	the	artificial	light	filtering	through	from	ventilation	slits	near	the	top		
lincoln	airbase	was	in	a	flurry	of	activity	the	field	was	alive	with	men	like	little	black	ants	preparing	the	reserve	fighters	and	pursuits	for	use	in	a	fever	of	urgent	speed		
a	simple	innocuous	listing	which	froze	him	to	his	seat		
shandor	read	off	his	list	giving	dates		
i	'll	go	over	it	closely	when	i	get	out	of	here		
a	little	dose	is	so	painful	you	ca	n't	do	anything	but	holler	for	a	while	but	it	wo	n't	hurt	you	permanently	unless	you	get	it	all	over	you		
so	ideologies	arose	to	try	to	solve	the	dilemma	of	a	basically	static	society	and	they	fought	wars		
i	might	say	i	'm	a	very	expert	propagandist		
his	calculations	placed	him	over	eastern	nebraska	and	a	few	moments	later	he	nosed	down	cautiously	and	verified	his	location		
i	know	i	'm	right	but	i	have	to	go	to	check	somethingto	make	sure	of	something		
they	've	got	a	smaller	one	in	nevada		
the	little	man	twisted	his	hands	almost	in	tears		
but	i	ca	n't	remember	anything	specific	except	that	he	used	to	say	over	and	over	how	he	hated	the	thought	of	another	war		
baker	grinned	and	chomped	his	tobacco		
he	flipped	off	the	connection	before	prex	could	reply		
the	girl	shrugged		
david	p.	ingersoll		
and	there	is	n't	any	air		
you	've	pointed	out	the	whole	trouble		
is	it	serious		
i	do	n't	think	he	wanted	me	because	of	the	writing		
you	set	me	up	for	a	sucker	but	the	plan	fell	through		
mariel	's	eyes	were	sullen		
he	got	in	people	's	way	and	they	hated	him	for	it		
he	always	no	nothat	's	not	right		
i	need	somebody	along	who	knows	how	to	make	things	painful		
he	took	up	a	dozen	of	the	stories	analyzed	them	carefully	word	for	word	sentence	by	sentence		
some	of	the	dispatches	were	associated	press	many	came	direct	desk	from	public	information	board	in	new	york	two	other	networks	sponsored	some	of	the	wordage		
i	've	only	met	him	a	couple	of	times		
because	a	crazy	twisted	impossible	idea	was	in	his	mind	an	idea	that	had	plagued	him	since	he	had	started	reading	that	morning	an	idea	with	an	answer	an	acid	test	folded	in	the	briefcase	under	his	arm		
shandor	's	eyes	narrowed		
he	shrugged	his	huge	shoulders	and	settled	affably	down	on	a	bench	near	the	wall		
you	're	the	only	one	i	know	that	could	do	the	job		
a	propagandist	has	to	write	it	tommyan	ace	propagandist		
he	read	it	unbelievingly	yet	knowing	that	it	was	the	only	possible	link		
do	n't	know	who	it	was	but	he	sounded	mighty	agitated		
a	small	grate	in	the	panel	before	him	popped	open	and	a	small	spool	plopped	out	onto	a	spindle		
then	he	sat	back	his	body	tired	eyes	closed	in	concentration	an	incredible	idea	twisting	and	writhing	and	solidifying	in	his	mind		
you	say	it	's	all	right	it	's	all	right		
long	enough		
things	happened	so	fast	and	i	was	so	confused	she	looked	straight	at	him		
you	're	crazy		
but	you	'll	have	to	read	it	in	the	newspapers		
shandor	blinked		
i	'll	fight	what	he	stands	for	now	he	's	dead	shandor	's	eyes	narrowed		
police	are	following	all	possible	leads	and	are	confident	that	there	has	been	no	foul	play		
prex	shrugged		
oh	tom	i	was	afraid	oh	tom		
how	big	could	dartmouth	bearing	be		
ann	i	've	got	to	go	ahead		
told	his	daughter	to	send	it	to	public	information	board	immediately	in	event	of	his	death		
all	the	administration	offices	are	in	chicago
