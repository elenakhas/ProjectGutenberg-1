or	else	perhaps	does	she	like	the	dog	in	the	fable	the	dog	that	carried	his	master	's	dinner	round	his	neck	knowing	that	all	is	irreparably	lost	prefer	to	die	taking	her	share	of	the	pillage	and	to	pass	from	life	to	death	in	one	prodigious	orgy		
we	say	to	it	for	instance	if	at	the	moment	of	undertaking	an	affair	we	could	know	that	its	outcome	would	be	unfortunate	we	should	not	undertake	it	and	since	it	must	be	written	somewhere	in	time	before	our	question	has	been	put	that	the	affair	will	not	take	place	seeing	that	we	abandon	it	we	could	not	therefore	foresee	the	outcome	of	that	which	will	have	no	beginning		
but	in	france	it	would	be	a	pity	to	return	to	it		
such	words	as	these	addressed	to	the	crowd	are	very	true	but	it	is	no	less	true	that	all	this	becomes	efficacious	only	after	it	has	been	experienced	and	lived	through		
the	eye	recognizes	with	emotion	the	familiar	colours	faded	by	the	centuries	and	the	picture	is	always	full	of	a	plaintive	grace		
so	as	not	to	lose	ourselves	in	this	road	which	would	lead	us	whither	nothing	calls	us	it	will	be	enough	for	us	to	say	that	the	future	like	all	that	exists	is	probably	more	coherent	and	more	logical	than	the	logic	of	our	imagination	and	that	all	our	hesitations	and	uncertainties	are	included	in	its	provisions		
viii	what	flowers	then	blossomed	in	the	gardens	of	our	fathers		
o	strange	infirmity	of	our	eyes	our	ears	and	that	brain	of	which	we	are	so	proud		
it	follows	a	uniform	and	inflexible	curve		
oh	do	not	fear	him		
in	future	they	will	have	to	avoid	the	imperceptible	but	insuperable	cleft	where	will	always	watch	the	little	jet	of	flame	that	turned	them	back		
if	he	who	receives	the	avowal	can	not	rise	to	the	height	of	loving	us	the	more	for	that	avowal	there	is	a	misunderstanding	in	our	love		
with	an	unquestioning	certainty	an	unconstraint	and	a	simplicity	that	surprise	us	a	little	deeming	us	better	and	more	powerful	than	all	that	exists	he	betrays	for	our	benefit	the	whole	of	the	animal	kingdom	to	which	he	belongs	and	without	scruple	denies	his	race	his	kin	his	mother	and	his	young		
but	what	shall	happen	if	the	image	takes	life	and	comes	forth	from	her	retreat	to	enter	upon	an	existence	in	which	all	that	does	not	take	part	in	the	movement	that	surrounds	it	becomes	a	pitiful	or	dangerous	wreck		
in	itself	we	may	be	almost	certain	that	it	is	but	an	immense	eternal	motionless	present	in	which	all	that	takes	place	and	all	that	will	take	place	takes	place	immutably	in	which	tomorrow	save	in	the	ephemeral	mind	of	man	is	indistinguishable	from	yesterday	or	today		
a	mere	nothing	a	stray	lock	a	fold	of	a	garment	that	is	not	in	its	customary	place	a	tense	muscle	makes	them	unpleasing	or	suspicious	pretentious	or	hard		
they	have	completed	the	conquest	of	the	globe		
many	of	our	defects	are	the	very	roots	of	our	good	qualities		
it	says	to	itself	that	it	will	have	to	cover	tomorrow	the	road	which	it	did	not	travel	today	and	that	in	the	meantime	by	thus	wasting	its	time	between	every	stage	it	has	nothing	to	gain	but	a	little	delusive	peace		
but	the	monster	i	say	to	myself	has	no	secrets	that	i	have	not	learned		
in	any	case	it	is	the	best	preparation	for	that	which	must	inevitably	come		
chastity	which	sat	waiting	with	eyes	closed	and	hands	folded	has	the	right	to	change	into	passion	which	shall	decide	and	settle	destiny		
is	it	better	or	worse	that	the	active	or	the	passive	virtues	should	stand	in	the	foreground		
her	conscience	is	so	natural	and	so	sound	that	we	do	not	hear	it	breathe	and	that	she	appears	unaware	of	its	existence		
he	is	our	intimate	and	impassioned	slave	whom	nothing	discourages	whom	nothing	repels	whose	ardent	trust	and	love	nothing	can	impair		
on	the	contrary	the	more	the	republic	prospers	the	more	harshly	and	severely	are	its	laws	applied	and	the	worker	in	a	hive	where	superfluity	accumulates	labours	much	more	zealously	than	her	sister	in	an	indigent	hive		
is	there	a	risk	in	approaching	the	hives		
almost	all	persuade	themselves	that	chance	reserves	for	them	special	and	premeditated	favours	or	misfortunes		
deliberately	they	cast	off	from	it	sentiment	imagination	all	that	does	not	properly	belong	to	it		
the	spanish	bean	a	native	of	south	america	and	the	sweet	pea	an	immigrant	from	sicily	number	a	little	over	two	hundred	years		
they	are	not	the	highpriests	but	the	officeclerks	of	hazard		
is	to	refrain	from	harming	enough	to	make	one	kind	to	refrain	from	lying	enough	to	make	one	true		
in	any	case	her	devotion	and	sacrifice	will	never	be	resigned	will	never	abandon	themselves	to	the	perfidious	sweetness	of	sorrow		
hence	the	eagerness	with	which	modern	dramatists	have	plunged	into	all	the	problems	of	contemporary	morality	and	it	may	safely	be	said	that	at	this	moment	they	confine	themselves	almost	exclusively	to	the	discussion	of	these	different	problems		
and	where	shall	we	look	for	that	exquisite	summer	's	night	which	owes	its	vastness	its	savour	the	very	appeal	that	it	makes	to	us	to	the	shadow	of	an	heroic	inevitable	death	that	already	lay	heavy	upon	it		
footnote	2	other	subjects	of	my	inquiries	gave	me	less	curious	but	often	analogous	results		
on	the	other	hand	however	the	highest	point	of	human	consciousness	is	attained	by	the	dramas	of	björnson	of	hauptmann	and	above	all	of	ibsen		
iv	it	behoves	us	therefore	in	general	to	praise	those	who	do	not	allow	themselves	to	be	offended	with	impunity		
it	is	thus	that	honour	in	the	chivalrous	conjugal	sense	of	the	word	i	refer	to	the	honour	of	the	husband	which	is	supposed	to	suffer	by	the	infidelity	of	the	wife	that	revenge	a	kind	of	morbid	prudishness	pride	vanity	piety	to	certain	gods	and	a	thousand	other	illusions	have	been	and	still	remain	the	unquenchable	source	of	a	multitude	of	duties	that	are	still	regarded	as	absolutely	sacred	absolutely	incontrovertible	by	a	vast	number	of	inferior	consciousnesses		
it	is	the	blindest	and	most	unequal	of	weapons	and	since	it	evades	all	the	conditions	that	adjust	the	chances	of	two	illmatched	adversaries	it	involves	exaggerated	reprisals	on	the	part	of	the	beaten	combatant	which	end	by	arming	him	with	the	stick	the	knife	or	the	revolver		
of	all	the	feminine	passions	none	has	perished	none	is	a	prisoner	for	all	are	needed	the	humblest	and	most	futile	and	the	greatest	and	most	dangerous	alike	to	form	the	perfume	that	love	loves	to	breathe		
iii	i	thought	it	curious	to	inquire	where	this	science	of	the	future	stands	today		
but	it	is	no	less	true	that	upon	trial	at	the	moment	when	you	rely	upon	the	assistance	of	the	surest	phantom	it	vanishes	abruptly	and	leaves	you	face	to	face	with	the	unknown	which	it	was	masking		
not	an	unaccustomed	word	or	gesture		
we	at	once	grasp	the	dominant	idea	the	obtrusive	beauty	the	unexpected	effort	of	the	year	in	this	special	world	strange	and	privileged	even	in	the	midst	of	the	strange	and	privileged	world	of	flowers		
the	fault	itself	we	have	eliminated	from	our	being		
i	began	by	selecting	a	moment	at	which	a	certain	project	whose	realization	which	did	not	depend	upon	myself	alone	was	to	be	of	great	importance	to	me	was	hanging	in	suspense		
ii	the	interior	corresponds	with	the	exterior		
yes	yes	i	see	do	n't	be	afraid	i	'll	help	you	you	will	be	pleased	but	the	enemy	of	whom	you	told	me	the	one	who	is	resisting	me	and	who	wishes	me	ill	no	no	he	wishes	you	no	ill	it	's	because	of	some	one	else		
lastly	to	enable	us	to	handle	the	bees	almost	without	impunity	there	exist	a	certain	number	of	little	expedients	which	vary	according	to	circumstances	and	which	can	be	learnt	by	practice	alone		
is	he	intended	only	for	us	to	play	with	to	amuse	the	leisure	of	our	eyes	to	adorn	or	enliven	the	home		
it	concerns	us	to	take	account	of	this		
for	the	rest	it	is	quite	possible	that	the	dog	or	rather	the	inaccessible	genius	of	his	race	troubles	scarcely	at	all	about	us	and	that	we	have	merely	known	how	to	make	use	of	various	aptitudes	offered	by	the	abundant	chances	of	life		
and	now	that	it	snorts	at	my	feet	i	can	recall	its	physiology		
it	is	among	familiar	plants	the	most	submissive	the	most	docile	the	most	tractable	and	the	most	attentive	plant	of	all	that	we	meet	on	life	's	long	way		
they	are	not	many	and	they	conceal	themselves	they	are	gnarled	oaks	beeches	planes	and	even	the	vine	which	one	would	have	thought	bettermannered	more	docile	and	wellinformed	remains	incredulous		
we	suffer	or	make	others	suffer	we	love	we	die	there	in	our	corner	and	it	were	the	strangest	chance	should	a	door	or	a	window	suddenly	for	an	instant	fly	open	beneath	the	pressure	of	extraordinary	despair	or	rejoicing		
illusion	is	the	opaque	veil	woven	with	the	ephemeral	threads	called	yesterday	today	and	tomorrow	which	we	embroider	on	those	realities		
for	when	the	sun	has	entered	into	the	consciousness	of	him	who	is	wise	as	we	may	hope	that	it	will	some	day	enter	into	that	of	all	men	it	will	reveal	one	duty	and	one	alone	which	is	that	we	should	do	the	least	possible	harm	and	love	others	as	we	love	ourselves	and	from	this	duty	no	drama	can	spring		
ii	it	is	this	insatiable	need	which	on	those	points	where	human	justice	remained	dumb	and	declared	itself	powerless	appealed	in	former	days	to	the	judgment	of	god		
admitting	the	ruin	it	looks	as	though	already	in	her	instinct	she	saw	the	future	dwelling	which	she	hopes	to	build	with	the	materials	taken	from	the	gutted	town		
according	to	others	it	obeys	certain	rhythms	that	are	easily	grasped		
but	that	which	regards	us	that	which	is	within	our	reach	that	which	is	to	unfold	itself	within	the	little	sphere	of	years	a	secretion	of	our	spiritual	organism	that	envelops	us	in	time	even	as	the	shell	or	the	cocoon	envelops	the	mollusc	or	the	insect	in	space	that	together	with	all	the	external	events	relating	to	it	is	probably	recorded	in	that	sphere		
if	after	its	realization	it	should	become	apparent	that	the	ideal	does	not	fulfil	its	promise	it	will	then	be	meet	that	we	should	think	of	perfecting	or	replacing	it		
this	rational	being	who	has	a	soul	     	and	professes	some	religion	comes	home	tired	and	half	starved	but	     	very	pleased	with	his	day	's	work	he	has	seen	some	tulips		
humbly	it	interrupts	or	diverts	the	order	preestablished	by	nature		
but	soon	it	grows	frantic	springs	forward	and	throws	itself	madly	upon	me	rushing	under	the	car	like	a	furious	torrent	whose	foam	lashes	my	face	it	drowns	me	beneath	its	waves	it	blinds	me	with	its	breath		
she	is	inflexible	towards	the	activity	which	she	directs	but	with	such	ease	that	she	seems	to	be	stopping	to	rest	or	to	bend	over	a	flower	when	she	is	with	all	her	strength	resisting	an	unjust	feeling	or	thought		
he	enjoyed	not	only	their	dazzling	presence	he	also	hopedprobably	unwisely	so	deep	and	confused	is	that	mysteryhe	also	hoped	by	dint	of	questioning	them	to	surprise	with	their	aid	i	know	not	what	secret	law	or	idea	of	nature	i	know	not	what	private	thought	of	the	universe	which	perhaps	betrays	itself	in	those	ardent	moments	in	which	it	strives	to	please	other	beings	to	beguile	other	lives	and	to	create	beauty		
in	their	hours	of	distress	they	have	discovered	new	forces	to	cling	to	that	seem	trustworthy	human	and	just	and	behold	them	thrust	back	to	a	century	wherein	prayer	and	the	sword	decide	all		
here	and	there	one	of	them	right	at	the	bottom	of	the	apothecary	's	or	herbalist	's	jars	still	awaits	the	coming	of	the	sick	man	faithful	to	the	infusions	of	tradition		
we	should	it	is	true	in	nature	have	other	splendid	manifestations	of	luxury	exuberance	and	grace	other	dazzling	efforts	of	the	superfluous	forces	the	sun	the	stars	the	varied	lights	of	the	moon	the	azure	and	the	ocean	the	dawns	and	twilights	the	mountain	the	plain	the	forest	and	the	rivers	the	light	and	the	trees	and	lastly	nearer	to	us	birds	precious	stones	and	woman		
enchanted	gardens	where	blossom	in	january	all	the	flowers	of	spring	summer	and	autumn	sweetscented	thickets	that	borrow	nothing	from	the	hostile	seasons	but	their	perfume	and	their	smiles	lie	before	its	porch		
the	seer	in	question	is	one	of	the	most	famous	in	paris		
should	a	youth	of	our	own	time	love	and	meet	obstacles	not	unlike	those	which	in	another	order	of	ideas	and	events	beset	romeo	's	passion	we	need	no	telling	that	his	adventure	will	be	embellished	by	none	of	the	features	that	gave	poetry	and	grandeur	to	the	episode	of	verona		
there	they	stand	black	and	gaunt	like	sick	people	on	an	easter	sunday	in	the	churchporch	made	transparent	by	the	splendour	of	the	sun		
so	soon	as	from	that	standpoint	we	see	our	instincts	even	the	lowest	and	the	most	selfish	at	work	provided	that	we	are	not	wilfully	wickedand	it	is	difficult	to	be	that	when	our	intelligence	has	acquired	the	lucidity	and	the	force	which	this	faculty	of	observation	impliesso	soon	as	we	see	them	thus	at	work	they	become	harmless	like	children	under	their	parents	eyes		
today	all	this	appears	to	us	so	profoundly	impossible	that	we	find	it	difficult	to	imagine	how	the	certain	reality	of	the	future	would	refute	the	objections	which	we	make	to	it	in	the	name	of	the	organic	illusion	of	our	minds		
and	we	ask	ourselves	if	this	new	idea	is	a	profound	and	really	necessary	idea	on	the	part	of	the	sun	the	earth	life	autumn	or	man		
do	not	believe	either	that	by	setting	yourselves	to	the	number	of	ten	thousand	who	do	not	know	against	one	who	knows	you	will	come	to	know	anything	or	that	you	will	compel	the	humblest	of	the	eternal	laws	to	follow	you	to	abandon	him	who	recognized	it		
that	is	why	no	traveller	would	take	it	into	his	head	to	maintain	that	the	towns	which	he	has	not	yet	visited	will	become	real	only	at	the	moment	when	he	sets	his	foot	within	their	walls		
certainly	there	was	in	his	intuition	something	more	than	a	fortunate	coincidence		
to	the	other	who	asked	her	how	a	lawsuit	would	end	she	replied	somewhat	evasively	on	that	point	by	way	of	compensation	she	spontaneously	revealed	the	spot	where	lay	a	certain	object	which	had	been	very	precious	to	the	person	consulting	her	but	which	had	been	so	long	lost	and	so	often	looked	for	in	vain	that	this	person	was	persuaded	that	he	had	ceased	to	think	about	it		
would	you	go	to	him	whose	shake	of	the	head	had	sullied	a	generous	action	or	a	mere	impulse	that	was	pure		
look	through	the	passive	correspondence	of	any	man	and	you	shall	find	in	it	an	astonishing	unity		
let	us	be	humble	and	learn	to	distinguish	between	accident	and	essence		
thus	do	i	conceive	it	to	be	with	hilda	and	solness	it	is	thus	surely	that	they	regard	each	other		
but	all	this	is	nothing	and	is	not	even	near	to	the	outer	lights	of	the	abyss		
happily	even	in	those	whose	vision	is	most	limited	there	is	always	something	that	acts	in	silence	as	though	they	had	seen		
it	was	the	nature	of	disaster	with	which	the	earliest	tragic	writers	were	all	unconsciously	preoccupied	and	this	it	was	that	though	they	knew	it	not	threw	a	solemn	shadow	round	the	hard	and	violent	gestures	of	external	death	and	it	is	this	too	that	has	become	the	rallyingpoint	of	the	most	recent	dramas	the	centre	of	light	with	strange	flames	gleaming	about	which	revolve	the	souls	of	women	and	of	men		
every	evening	will	its	sisters	recognise	the	soul	that	pronounced	the	word	and	henceforth	be	the	conversation	never	so	trivial	its	mere	presence	will	i	know	not	how	add	thereto	something	of	majesty		
is	it	indeed	essential	that	your	mother	should	breathe	her	last	in	your	arms	that	your	children	should	perish	in	a	shipwreck	and	that	you	yourself	should	pass	by	the	side	of	death	for	you	at	length	to	understand	that	you	have	your	being	in	an	incomprehensible	world	where	you	shall	be	for	ever	where	an	unseen	god	who	is	eternally	alone	dwells	with	his	creatures		
it	is	death	that	is	the	guide	of	our	life	and	our	life	has	no	goal	but	death		
and	it	is	from	this	moment	that	he	truly	belongs	to	us		
but	others	there	are	who	linger	for	a	moment	who	look	at	us	with	an	eager	smile	and	seem	to	be	on	the	point	of	confessing	that	they	know	all	and	then	towards	their	twentieth	year	they	leave	us	hurriedly	muffling	their	footsteps	as	though	they	had	just	discovered	that	they	had	chosen	the	wrong	dwellingplace	and	had	been	about	to	pass	their	lives	among	men	whom	they	did	not	know		
what	was	there	that	divided	us	from	them		
i	have	known	more	than	one	man	who	performed	every	act	of	kindness	and	mercy	without	touching	a	single	soul	and	i	have	known	others	who	seemed	to	live	in	falsehood	and	injustice	yet	were	no	souls	driven	from	them	nor	did	any	for	an	instant	even	believe	that	these	men	were	not	good		
thousands	and	thousands	of	laws	there	are	mightier	and	more	venerable	than	those	of	passion	but	in	common	with	all	that	is	endowed	with	resistless	force	these	laws	are	silent	and	discreet	and	slowmoving	and	hence	it	is	only	in	the	twilight	that	they	can	be	seen	and	heard	in	the	meditation	that	comes	to	us	at	the	tranquil	moments	of	life		
it	is	only	the	life	of	violence	the	life	of	bygone	days	that	is	perceived	by	nearly	all	our	tragic	writers	and	truly	may	one	say	that	anachronism	dominates	the	stage	and	that	dramatic	art	dates	back	as	many	years	as	the	art	of	sculpture		
there	are	moments	when	it	would	seem	as	though	we	were	on	the	threshold	of	a	new	pessimism	mysterious	and	perhaps	very	pure		
would	she	like	a	bashful	maiden	cloak	beneath	her	long	hair	the	numberless	sins	of	the	flesh		
nothing	is	visible	and	yet	all	is	revealed		
the	result	can	never	be	foretold	all	this	comes	to	pass	in	a	heaven	that	never	warns	and	therefore	it	is	that	the	tenderest	of	lovers	will	often	defer	to	the	last	hour	of	all	the	solemn	entry	of	the	great	revealer	of	the	depths	of	our	being	for	they	too	are	well	aware	the	love	that	is	truly	love	brings	the	most	frivolous	back	to	life	’s	centre	they	too	are	well	aware	that	all	that	had	gone	before	was	but	as	children	playing	outside	the	gates	and	that	it	is	now	that	the	walls	are	falling	and	existence	lying	bare		
the	others	are	all	watching	eagerly	around	us	like	little	children	in	front	of	a	marvellous	palace		
you	can	play	in	life	as	innocently	as	a	child	about	a	deathbed,’	and	it	is	not	the	tears	that	are	indispensable		
may	it	not	be	at	the	bedside	of	the	last	agony	that	is	woven	the	veritable	and	most	precious	crown	of	sage	and	hero	and	of	all	who	have	known	how	to	live	earnestly	amid	the	sorrows	lofty	pure	and	discreet	of	life	according	to	the	soul		
seeking	our	sorrows	we	shall	be	the	most	effectively	seeking	ourselves	for	truly	may	it	be	said	that	the	value	of	ourselves	is	but	the	value	of	our	melancholy	and	our	disquiet		
it	is	there	in	its	simplicity	smiling	on	the	threshold	of	our	soul	and	those	in	whom	its	smiles	lie	deepest	or	shine	forth	most	frequently	may	make	us	suffer	day	and	night	and	they	will	yet	shall	it	be	beyond	our	power	to	cease	to	love	them		
and	to	come	nearer	to	our	own	time	though	racine	may	indeed	be	the	unerring	poet	of	the	woman	’s	heart	who	would	dare	to	claim	for	him	that	he	has	ever	taken	one	step	towards	her	soul		
we	believe	we	have	discovered	a	grotto	that	is	stored	with	bewildering	treasure	we	come	back	to	the	light	of	day	and	the	gems	we	have	brought	are	false	mere	pieces	of	glass	and	yet	does	the	treasure	shine	on	unceasingly	in	the	darkness		
is	it	beyond	the	mark	to	say	that	the	true	tragic	element	normal	deeprooted	and	universal	that	the	true	tragic	element	of	life	only	begins	at	the	moment	when	socalled	adventures	sorrows	and	dangers	have	disappeared		
does	it	not	seem	as	though	the	supreme	cry	of	the	soul	were	at	last	about	to	pierce	the	dense	clouds	of	error	that	still	envelop	it	in	music		
so	little		
for	one	instant	has	a	soul	dared	to	reveal	itself	even	such	as	it	is	in	love	and	sorrow	such	as	it	is	in	face	of	death	and	in	the	solitude	that	dwells	around	the	stars	of	night		
from	that	moment	the	merest	nothing	reveals	his	presence	and	the	greatness	of	our	life	depends	on	so	little		
then	it	is	no	longer	necessary	that	a	great	king	should	die	for	us	to	remember	that	the	world	does	not	end	at	the	housedoors,’	and	not	an	evening	passes	but	the	smallest	thing	suffices	to	ennoble	the	soul		
their	abidingplace	is	at	the	foot	itself	of	the	inevitable	whose	wellworn	paths	are	visible	to	them	more	clearly	than	to	us		
is	it	while	i	flee	before	a	naked	sword	that	my	existence	touches	its	most	interesting	point		
nay	there	are	moments	when	it	bears	the	semblance	of	an	ultimatum	and	therefore	does	it	behove	us	to	neglect	nothing	but	indeed	with	all	eagerness	to	accept	this	imperious	invitation	that	is	like	unto	the	dream	that	is	lost	for	ever	unless	instantaneously	seized		
and	if	like	don	juan	we	take	a	thousand	and	three	to	our	embraces	still	shall	we	find	on	that	evening	when	arms	fall	asunder	and	lips	disunite	that	it	is	always	the	same	woman	good	or	bad	tender	or	cruel	loving	or	faithless	that	is	standing	before	us		
it	is	possible	for	you	to	cause	extraordinary	tears	to	flow	it	is	possible	that	you	may	fill	a	heart	with	unheard	of	certitudes	and	give	eternal	life	unto	a	soul	and	no	one	shall	know	of	it	nor	shall	you	even	know	yourself		
at	school	we	were	vaguely	conscious	of	them		
and	the	reason	must	surely	be	that	these	things	were	not	so	clearly	evident	then	for	at	every	period	there	have	been	men	who	penetrated	to	the	innermost	recesses	of	life	to	its	most	secret	affinities	and	all	that	they	learned	of	the	heart	the	soul	and	the	spirit	of	their	epoch	has	been	handed	down	to	us		
what	god	that	is	indeed	on	the	heights	but	must	smile	at	our	gravest	faults	as	we	smile	at	the	puppies	on	the	hearthrug		
were	they	forming	a	circle	round	it	and	trying	to	keep	it	hidden	from	indifferent	eyes		
the	sage	needs	no	such	violent	arousing		
which	of	us	when	by	the	side	of	the	most	ordinary	person	perhaps	but	has	suddenly	become	conscious	of	the	advent	of	something	that	none	had	summoned		
long	slowly	falling	tears	are	needed	here		
yet	has	each	one	of	them	when	alone	more	than	once	lived	in	accord	with	his	soul		
the	lowest	of	men	would	rather	be	just	than	unjust	we	all	worship	we	all	pray	numbers	of	times	every	day	without	knowing	it.’	and	we	are	surprised	when	chance	suddenly	reveals	to	us	the	importance	of	this	divine	part		
for	the	soul	of	man	is	a	guest	that	has	gone	hungry	these	centuries	back	and	never	has	it	to	be	summoned	twice	to	the	nuptial	feast		
wildly	pressing	down	their	eyelids	so	as	not	to	see	that	which	had	to	be	seen	struggling	with	all	their	puny	strength	against	the	eternal	forces	they	will	contrive	perhaps	to	cross	the	road	and	go	towards	another	sent	thither	but	not	for	them		
if	i	push	open	today	the	door	of	the	house	wherein	i	am	to	meet	the	first	smiles	of	a	sorrow	that	shall	know	no	end	i	do	these	things	for	a	longer	time	than	one	imagines		
what	can	i	learn	from	creatures	who	have	but	one	fixed	idea	and	who	have	no	time	to	live	for	that	there	is	a	rival	or	a	mistress	whom	it	behoves	them	to	put	to	death		
i	know	not		
why	do	they	come	to	us	like	the	bee	to	the	hive	like	the	dove	to	the	cote	and	where	do	they	find	a	restingplace	when	we	are	not	there	to	meet	them		
and	all	that	is	might	well	be	more	mysterious	still		
will	the	day	ever	dawn	when	we	shall	be	what	we	are		
in	the	meanwhile	we	felt	that	they	were	strangers	in	our	midst		
but	in	what	life	are	there	not	thousands	of	hours	akin	to	the	hour	in	that	drama	where	all	are	waiting	for	the	divine	intervention	and	none	perceive	it	till	an	invisible	thought	that	has	flitted	across	the	consciousness	of	a	dying	man	suddenly	reveals	itself	and	an	old	man	cries	out	sobbing	for	joy	and	terror	but	god	there	is	god!’	must	we	always	be	warned	and	can	we	only	fall	on	our	knees	when	some	one	is	there	to	tell	us	that	god	is	passing	by		
it	matters	not		
we	are	told	that	in	the	very	temple	of	love	we	do	but	obey	the	unvarying	orders	of	an	invisible	throng		
they	have	but	obeyed	and	even	though	the	saint	be	deceived	and	sold	by	the	man	he	has	preferred	still	will	there	abide	with	him	something	imperishable	something	by	which	he	shall	know	that	he	was	right	and	that	he	has	nothing	to	regret		
it	would	seem	at	moments	such	as	these	as	though	humanity	were	on	the	point	of	struggling	from	beneath	the	crushing	burden	of	matter	that	weighs	it	down		
for	indeed	nothing	of	beauty	can	pass	by	and	be	altogether	unperceived		
and	even	so	do	we	know	that	this	other	will	sally	forth	in	vain	in	pursuit	of	adventure		
i	have	known	many	whom	the	same	death	was	leading	by	the	hand	and	when	my	memory	dwells	upon	them	i	see	a	band	of	children	of	youths	and	maidens	who	seem	to	be	all	coming	forth	from	the	same	house		
i	am	ever	standing	at	the	seashore	and	were	i	plato	pascal	or	michael	angelo	and	the	woman	i	loved	merely	telling	me	of	her	earrings	the	words	i	would	say	and	the	words	she	would	say	would	appear	but	the	same	as	they	floated	on	the	waves	of	the	fathomless	inner	sea	that	each	of	us	would	be	contemplating	in	the	other		
our	soul	will	not	become	earnest	and	deepsearching	as	is	the	soul	of	the	angels	for	that	we	have	for	one	fleeting	instant	beheld	the	universe	in	the	shadow	of	death	or	eternity	in	the	radiance	of	joy	or	the	flames	of	beauty	and	love		
which	of	us	an’	he	question	himself	the	side	of	the	light	from	which	our	gaze	is	habitually	averted	which	of	us	but	will	find	in	himself	the	recollection	of	certain	strange	workings	of	this	force		
this	is	known	to	nearly	all	men	but	know	it	though	they	may	it	is	only	when	fortune	or	death	lashes	them	that	they	grope	around	the	wall	of	life	in	search	of	the	crevices	through	which	god	may	be	seen		
that	they	are	ever	pressing	upon	life	unceasingly	and	with	prodigious	force	this	was	unsuspected	of	all	and	the	philosopher	hastened	back	to	familiar	studies	of	passion	and	of	incident	that	floated	on	the	surface		
at	moments	we	might	believe	it	to	be	a	recollection	furtive	but	excessively	keen	of	the	great	primitive	unity		
sophocles	indicates	the	character	of	his	heroes	by	means	of	the	lightest	and	quickest	of	touches		
it	lives	in	silence	and	the	hand	of	a	great	judge	is	ever	upon	it	though	his	sentences	are	beyond	our	ken		
and	even	when	the	threshold	is	crossed	where	shall	certainty	be	found		
frequently	indeed	will	the	greatest	suffering	be	caused	by	those	whose	love	is	greatest	for	a	strange	timid	tender	cruelty	is	most	often	the	anxious	sister	of	love		
have	we,’	asks	claude	de	saintmartin	the	great	unknown	philosopher,’	have	we	advanced	one	step	further	on	the	radiant	path	of	enlightenment	that	leads	to	the	simplicity	of	men?’	let	us	wait	in	silence	perhaps	ere	long	we	shall	be	conscious	of	the	murmur	of	the	gods.’	the	predestined	the	predestined	they	are	known	to	most	men	and	there	are	few	mothers	who	have	not	seen	them		
something	there	is	that	we	hide	from	most	men	and	we	ourselves	are	ignorant	of	what	this	thing	may	be		
a	curious	calm	steals	over	us		
indeed	it	is	not	in	the	actions	but	in	the	words	that	are	found	the	beauty	and	greatness	of	tragedies	that	are	truly	beautiful	and	great	and	this	not	solely	in	the	words	that	accompany	and	explain	the	action	for	there	must	perforce	be	another	dialogue	besides	the	one	which	is	superficially	necessary		
but	readily	as	we	all	may	feel	this	to	prove	it	is	by	no	means	easy	inasmuch	as	this	essential	tragic	element	comprises	more	than	that	which	is	merely	material	or	merely	psychological		
on	that	instant	did	the	soul	by	the	side	of	you	awake	on	the	summits	of	its	being	something	sprang	to	life	in	regions	loftier	far	than	the	love	of	jaded	lovers	and	for	all	that	the	bodies	might	shrink	asunder	henceforth	would	the	souls	never	forget	that	for	an	instant	they	had	beheld	each	other	high	above	mountains	they	had	never	seen	and	that	for	a	second	’s	space	they	had	been	good	with	a	goodness	they	had	never	known	until	that	day	what	can	this	be	this	mysterious	movement	that	i	speak	of	here	in	connection	with	love	only	but	which	may	well	take	place	in	the	smallest	events	of	life		
othello	is	admirably	jealous		
we	are	told	that	a	thousand	centuries	divide	us	from	ourselves	when	we	choose	the	woman	we	love	and	that	the	first	kiss	of	the	betrothed	is	but	the	seal	that	thousands	of	hands	craving	for	birth	impress	upon	the	lips	of	the	mother	they	desire		
i	have	caused	suffering	because	we	are	in	a	world	where	all	is	held	together	by	invisible	threads	in	a	world	where	none	are	alone	and	where	the	gentlest	gesture	of	love	or	kindliness	may	so	often	wound	the	innocence	by	our	side!—i	have	caused	suffering	too	because	there	are	times	when	the	best	and	tenderest	are	impelled	to	seek	i	know	not	what	part	of	themselves	in	the	grief	of	others		
for	the	soul	of	man	is	a	guest	that	has	gone	hungry	these	centuries	back	and	never	has	it	to	be	summoned	twice	to	the	nuptial	feast		
did	we	but	dread	beauty	less	it	would	come	about	that	nought	else	in	life	would	be	visible	for	in	reality	it	is	beauty	that	underlies	everything	it	is	beauty	alone	that	exists		
i	felt	that	i	had	arrived	alone	at	that	sad	zone	of	kisses	when	it	seems	to	us	that	we	are	visiting	the	hovels	of	the	poor	while	she	who	had	lingered	on	the	road	was	still	smiling	in	the	palace	of	the	first	days		
it	is	as	though	men	dreaded	the	contact	of	their	soul	and	were	anxious	to	keep	its	beauty	at	immeasurable	distance		
one	might	almost	believe	that	there	exists	somewhere	a	place	where	all	is	weighed	in	the	presence	of	the	spirits	or	perhaps	out	yonder	the	other	side	of	the	night	a	reservoir	of	certitudes	whither	the	silent	herd	of	souls	flock	every	morning	to	slake	their	thirst		
it	means	that	each	day	will	reveal	to	us	a	new	beauty	in	that	mysterious	angel	and	that	we	shall	walk	together	in	a	goodness	that	shall	ever	become	more	and	more	living	loftier	and	loftier		
it	can	not	forgive	for	forgiveness	here	were	but	the	denial	of	itself		
do	you	not	think	it	would	be	more	akin	to	the	discourse	that	would	naturally	be	held	between	two	souls		
loving	thus	we	can	no	longer	have	anything	to	conceal	for	that	the	everpresent	soul	transforms	all	things	into	beauty		
why	not	dare	to	be	the	one	to	begin		
thus	he	continued	i	have	caused	suffering	because	i	loved	and	also	have	i	caused	suffering	because	i	did	not	lovebut	how	great	was	the	difference	in	the	two	cases		
needs	must	one	god	beckon	to	another	and	no	signal	is	so	imperceptible	but	they	will	every	one	of	them	respond		
can	the	beauty	not	exist	that	is	not	understood	and	is	there	not	in	every	man	something	that	does	understandin	regions	far	beyond	what	he	seems	to	understand	far	beyond	too	what	he	believes	he	understands		
it	means	that	the	least	gesture	will	call	forth	the	presence	of	the	soul	with	all	its	treasure		
does	not	evil	itself	become	precious	so	soon	as	it	has	gathered	therefrom	the	deep	lying	diamond	of	repentance		
i	said	just	now	that	the	soul	changed	into	beauty	the	little	things	we	gave	to	it		
but	it	matters	not	we	have	learned	that	nothing	can	be	lost	in	the	soul	and	that	even	to	the	very	pettiest	there	come	moments	of	splendor		
this	is	brought	home	to	us	at	every	moment	of	our	life	and	is	no	less	evident	to	the	man	by	whom	beauty	may	more	than	once	have	been	denied	than	to	him	who	is	ever	seeking	it	in	his	heart		
would	you	go	to	him	whose	shake	of	the	head	had	sullied	a	generous	action	or	a	mere	impulse	that	was	pure		
it	requires	more	effort	to	fall	perhaps	than	to	rise		
and	yet	will	you	have	rendered	no	assistance	to	the	untiring	queen	other	thoughts	will	have	filled	your	mind	and	it	will	be	without	your	knowledge	that	the	act	will	have	been	purified	in	the	silence	of	your	being	and	will	have	flown	into	the	precious	waters	that	lie	in	the	great	reservoir	of	truth	and	beauty	which	unlike	the	shallower	reservoir	of	true	or	beautiful	thoughts	has	an	ever	unruffled	surface	and	remains	for	all	time	out	of	reach	of	the	breath	of	life		
they	will	see	it	and	their	greeting	to	you	will	be	very	different	than	had	you	been	meditating	how	best	to	deceive	your	brother		
its	nature	changes	from	the	moment	that	it	manifests	itself	by	means	of	an	exterior	act	and	we	are	no	longer	in	the	truth	according	to	the	soul	but	in	a	kind	of	falsehood	as	conceived	by	man		
nothing	responds	more	infallibly	to	the	secret	cry	of	goodness	than	the	secret	cry	of	goodness	that	is	near		
grief	is	love	's	first	food	and	every	love	that	has	not	been	fed	on	a	little	pure	suffering	must	die	like	the	babe	that	one	had	tried	to	nourish	on	the	nourishment	of	a	man		
and	if	our	eyes	bring	it	nothing	still	will	it	know	how	to	turn	its	pitiful	disillusion	into	something	ineffable	that	it	will	conceal	even	till	its	death		
they	themselves	had	been	the	first	to	be	beautiful	and	had	therefore	attracted	all	the	beauty	that	passed	by	as	a	lighthouse	attracts	the	vessels	from	the	four	corners	of	the	horizon		
is	it	all	that	is	admirable	and	sorrowful	in	the	mere	act	of	living	that	at	such	moments	floods	our	beingis	it	the	aspect	of	life	one	and	indivisible		
and	yet	does	it	not	reveal	itself	to	the	eyes	of	the	body		
loving	thus	we	have	no	longer	even	the	need	to	forgive		
even	he	who	rejects	your	word	will	in	spite	of	himself	have	taken	a	step	towards	the	beauty	that	is	within	him		
but	one	day	peradventure	the	word	comes	up	again	extraordinarily	transformed	and	revealing	the	unexpected	fruit	it	has	borne	in	the	darkness	then	silence	once	more	falls	over	all		
if	we	could	but	probe	to	the	root	of	things	it	might	well	be	discovered	that	it	is	by	the	strength	of	some	souls	that	are	beautiful	that	others	are	sustained	in	life		
if	you	have	never	in	your	life	felt	the	power	of	your	invisible	goodness	go	no	further	it	would	be	useless		
these	men	had	begun		
do	you	imagine	it	would	pass	quite	unnoticed	or	merely	arouse	surprise		
bear	it	in	mind	however	that	here	we	are	on	the	mountains	where	not	to	know	oneself	means	far	more	than	mere	ignorance	of	what	takes	place	within	us	at	moments	of	jealousy	or	love	fear	or	envy	happiness	or	unhappiness		
it	can	not	be	said	too	often	that	be	the	crevice	never	so	small	it	will	yet	suffice	for	all	the	waters	of	heaven	to	pour	into	our	soul		
loving	thus	we	perceive	truth	in	happiness	as	profoundly	as	some	of	the	heroes	perceived	it	in	the	radiance	of	greatest	sorrow		
we	know	now	that	another	love	had	sprung	to	life	a	love	that	demands	not	the	words	the	little	attentions	and	smiles	of	ordinary	love		
i	have	for	a	long	time	followed	that	man	's	life	and	have	seen	the	inexplicable	power	he	exercised	over	the	most	obscure	the	most	unapproachable	the	blindest	even	the	most	rebellious	of	souls		
and	would	it	not	be	in	accordance	with	the	primal	truth	if	all	men	were	to	feel	that	they	were	face	to	face	with	each	other	even	as	the	woman	feels	with	the	man	she	loves		
resignedly	does	it	labor	its	whole	life	long	in	the	darkness	whither	most	of	us	relegate	it	where	it	is	spoken	to	by	none		
but	if	the	door	open	not	and	how	many	lives	are	there	wherein	it	does	open		
but	in	this	idea	how	much	is	there	of	the	soul	that	is	chosen	how	much	of	him	who	chooses		
it	is	there	in	its	simplicity	smiling	on	the	threshold	of	our	soul	and	those	in	whom	its	smiles	lies	deepest	or	shine	forth	most	frequently	may	make	us	suffer	day	and	night	and	they	will	yet	shall	it	be	beyond	our	power	to	cease	to	love	them		
there	are	within	us	lives	in	which	we	love	unconsciously		
e.	divineconcludes	thus	as	regards	ourselves	we	are	beautiful	when	we	belong	to	ourselves	and	ugly	when	we	lower	ourselves	to	our	inferior	nature		
and	yet	with	the	generality	of	men	ingenuity	strength	and	skill	do	but	imply	that	the	soul	must	first	of	all	be	banished	from	their	life	and	that	every	impulse	that	lies	too	deep	must	be	carefully	brushed	aside		
even	to	the	very	wretchedest	of	all	said	to	me	one	day	the	loftiest	minded	creature	it	has	ever	been	my	happiness	to	know	even	to	the	very	wretchedest	of	all	i	never	have	the	courage	to	say	anything	in	reply	that	is	ugly	or	mediocre		
we	are	surprised	when	certain	men	tell	us	that	they	have	never	come	across	real	ugliness	that	they	can	not	conceive	that	a	soul	can	be	base		
but	are	there	really	any	who	have	not	felt	this	power	and	have	the	worst	of	us	never	been	invisibly	good		
wherefore	you	will	do	well	to	think	it	over	for	none	are	alone	and	those	who	are	good	must	watch		
much	is	to	learn	much	to	forget	       	through	worlds	i	shall	traverse	not	a	few		
it	is	no	law	of	our	making	and	i	know	not	whether	i	would	dare	to	love	the	man	who	had	made	no	one	weep		
at	moments	we	might	believe	it	to	be	a	recollection	furtive	but	excessively	keen	of	the	great	primitive	unity		
some	there	are	who	do	thus	in	beauty	love	each	other		
there	is	no	soul	but	is	conscious	of	this	none	that	is	not	in	readiness	but	where	are	those	that	hide	not	their	beauty		
the	souls	of	all	our	brethren	are	ever	hovering	about	us	craving	for	a	caress	and	only	waiting	for	the	signal		
even	though	perhaps	you	had	been	of	those	who	commended	him	you	would	none	the	less	when	it	was	truth	that	knocked	at	your	door	turn	to	the	man	who	had	known	how	to	prostrate	himself	and	love		
there	never	complaining	does	it	do	all	that	in	its	power	lies	striving	to	tear	from	out	the	pebbles	we	fling	to	it	the	nucleus	of	eternal	light	that	peradventure	they	contain		
we	see	nothing	but	bucklers	and	helmets	we	touch	nothing	but	iron	and	brass		
hide	as	it	may	let	it	but	raise	its	head	move	a	link	of	its	chain	or	open	its	hand	and	the	prison	is	illumined	the	pressure	of	radiance	from	within	bursts	open	the	iron	barrier	and	then	suddenly	there	yawns	a	gulf	between	words	and	beings	a	gulf	peopled	with	agitated	angels	silence	falls	over	all	the	eyes	turn	away	for	a	moment	and	two	souls	embrace	tearfully	on	the	threshold		
for	my	part	said	a	sage	to	me	one	day	i	have	never	come	across	a	single	woman	who	did	not	bring	to	me	something	that	was	great		
but	there	are	those	who	complain	of	women	for	instance	never	dreaming	that	the	first	time	a	man	meets	a	woman	a	single	word	or	thought	that	denies	the	beautiful	or	profound	will	be	enough	to	poison	for	ever	his	existence	in	her	soul		
while	you	are	actively	good	in	the	invisible	all	those	who	approach	you	will	unconsciously	do	things	that	they	could	not	do	by	the	side	of	any	other	man		
as	we	wander	from	the	gods	within	us	so	does	ugliness	enwrap	us	as	we	discover	them	so	do	we	become	more	beautiful		
no	longer	is	there	need	of	death	disaster	or	tears	for	that	the	soul	shall	appear	a	smile	suffices		
whereas	on	the	contrary	we	should	endeavor	to	move	in	advance	of	ourselves		
and	yet	in	the	domain	where	we	are	everything	is	effective	for	that	everything	is	waiting		
to	love	thus	means	more	than	to	have	pity	to	make	inner	sacrifices	to	be	anxious	to	help	and	give	happiness	it	is	a	thing	that	lies	a	thousand	fathoms	deeper	where	our	softest	swiftest	strongest	words	can	not	reach	it		
ah		
this	was	brought	home	to	me	that	evening		
we	are	afraid	of	everything	that	can	not	be	explained	by	word	or	gesture	and	we	shut	our	eyes	to	all	that	we	do	ourselves	notwithstanding	in	the	empire	where	explanations	are	vain		
and	yet	what	is	needed	to	become	the	grownup	person	for	whom	they	lie	in	wait		
it	is	unmistakably	borne	home	to	us	that	even	the	unhappiest	and	the	most	destitute	of	men	have	at	the	depths	of	their	being	and	in	spite	of	themselves	a	treasure	of	beauty	that	they	can	not	despoil		
why	are	we	so	fearful	lest	we	exhaust	the	heaven	within	us		
and	to	love	thus	means	that	little	by	little	the	sense	of	ugliness	is	lost	that	one	's	eyes	are	closed	to	all	the	littlenesses	of	life	to	all	but	the	freshness	and	virginity	of	the	very	humblest	of	souls		
then	why	keep	back	a	lofty	beautiful	word	for	that	you	doubt	whether	others	will	understand		
might	not	everything	naturally	turn	into	beauty	were	we	not	unceasingly	interrupting	the	arduous	labors	of	our	soul		
when	we	raise	our	eyes	it	yearns	for	a	ray	of	sun	or	star	that	it	may	weave	into	a	thought	or	haply	an	impulse	which	shall	be	unconscious	and	very	pure		
the	soul	is	not	exacting		
and	yet	it	is	possible	that	nothing	is	changing	in	the	life	one	sees	but	is	it	only	that	which	matters	and	is	our	existence	indeed	confined	to	actions	we	can	take	in	our	hand	like	stones	on	the	highroad
