do	n't	worry	about	the	lock	snapped	greg		
greg	leaped	forward	stared	at	the	screen		
i	hope	their	compensator	worked	as	well	as	ours	he	said		
yes	agreed	russ		
they	're	with	me		
scrambling	to	his	feet	scorio	gibbered	madly	for	the	sixinch	figure	was	growing		
if	we	had	the	records	of	the	callisto	prison	suggested	russ	we	could	find	out		
if	we	only	had	a	margin	he	groaned		
i	wonder	if	wilson	could	get	us	one	in	frisco	and	bring	it	back		
i	have	been	afraid	of	this	ever	since	craven	blanketed	us	out	of	the	interplanetary	building		
he	demanded		
you	fool	with	characters	like	them	and	you	got	trouble		
almost	the	speed	of	light	and	that	would	cut	down	his	energy	intake	terrifically		
i	've	heard	of	you		
they	read	what	the	men	wrote	read	what	was	written	to	them	heard	what	they	said	saw	how	they	acted		
russ	page	stared	incredulously	at	the	television	screen		
i	'd	rather	not		
no	use	trying	it	now	for	we	could	n't	use	it	because	we	're	in	the	same	space	condition	it	uses	in	normal	operation		
the	man	at	the	door	jerked	his	head		
there	was	a	sound	of	ripping	cloth	as	something	like	a	great	powerful	hand	flung	aside	wilson	's	coat	tore	away	the	inside	pocket		
you	have	to	hope		
sudden	silence	smote	the	ship		
if	we	do	n't	we	'll	be	inside	the	planetary	system		
greg	's	hand	twisted	the	control	slightly	and	the	set	went	through	the	door	into	the	office	of	spencer	chambers		
a	moment	later	the	administration	offices	of	the	prison	were	on	the	screen		
by	dawn	they	knew	what	they	were	doing		
we	're	marooned		
my	math	must	have	been	wrong	some	factor	that	i	did	n't	include	in	the	equation		
they	always	reach	the	man	who	has	oppressed	them	they	always	tear	him	down	from	the	place	he	sits	and	they	do	not	deal	gently	with	him	when	they	do		
screamed	in	a	single	frightful	agony	as	they	threw	into	the	protecting	wall	that	enclosed	the	invincible	all	the	power	they	could	develop		
he	volunteered	no	further	information	went	back	to	work	with	the	pad	and	pencil		
they	were	hard	to	find		
greg	screamed	above	the	roar		
spacesuits	gained	a	point		
asked	russ		
we	ca	n't	leave	them	in	those	force	shells	too	long	because	they	'll	die	for	lack	of	air		
straight	ahead	of	the	ship	etched	in	silvery	moonlines	against	the	background	of	the	starsprinkled	sky	was	a	grim	and	terrible	face		
russ	heard	his	smothered	cry	of	rage		
we	do	n't	like	it	here		
he	whirled	on	reg		
the	two	men	faced	one	another	one	the	smooth	tawny	lion	the	other	the	snarling	wolf		
slowly	carefully	russell	page	tapped	keys	on	the	control	board	setting	up	an	equation		
where	can	they	be	going		
why	not		
repulsion	would	have	been	the	answer	said	russ	bitterly		
chambers	slumped	into	his	chair	his	hands	grasping	the	arms	on	either	side	of	his	great	body	his	eyes	staring	out	through	the	window	from	which	flooded	the	last	rays	of	the	afternoon	sun		
get	rid	of	whatever	you	have	in	titan	copper	at	10:30		
russ	leaned	back	blowing	smoke	toward	the	higharched	control	room	ceiling		
at	the	nose	and	stern	two	hemispheres	of	bluewhite	radiance	fitted	over	the	metal	framework	like	the	jaws	of	a	powerful	vise	holding	the	craft	immovable		
somewhere	around	there		
grimly	surely	greg	drove	his	strange	machine	through	new	york		
chambers	leaned	forward	and	pressed	a	buzzer		
for	a	moment	he	stood	hesitating	as	if	he	were	trying	to	make	up	his	mind		
but	this	field	wo	n't		
we	shook	them	up	a	bit		
with	our	margin	of	speed	we	should	overhaul	him	in	a	few	more	hours		
in	the	laboratory	russ	and	greg	looked	at	one	another		
we	came	out	to	get	him	and	now	he	has	us	instead		
ca	n't	have	you	laid	up		
perhaps	a	little	longer	he	admitted	finally		
chambers	rose	from	his	chair	and	walked	to	the	window	looked	out		
when	he	raised	the	glass	to	his	mouth	his	stillshaking	hand	poured	half	the	drink	over	his	white	shirt	front		
a	tumult	buzzed	within	his	skull		
and	as	he	cut	it	he	was	able	to	absorb	more	energy	with	his	collector	lens		
that	was	n't	my	idea		
i	've	told	you	all	i	know		
that	field	concentrates	the	forces	of	gravity	already	present		
it	would	eliminate	the	necessity	of	your	rented	accumulators		
the	scientist	glared	at	the	wolfish	face	and	without	speaking	walked	to	the	desk	and	sat	down		
stooping	he	stared	into	it		
chizzy	rose	out	of	his	seat	and	froze	in	sudden	terror		
his	gray	eyes	bored	into	the	wolfish	face		
page	and	manning	are	two	men	who	ca	n't	simply	disappear		
the	controls	were	locked	at	maximum	and	the	engines	still	hammered	their	roaring	song	of	speed	and	power		
sure	said	russ		
there	wo	n't	be	any	strongarm	stuff	not	until	he	recalls	stutsman	from	callisto		
he	started	to	rise	from	his	chair	but	at	that	moment	the	coffee	and	sandwiches	arrived		
material	energy	would	wipe	you	out		
i	'm	afraid	i	do	n't	understand		
there	's	a	time	lag	somewhere		
russ	drew	doodles	on	a	calculation	sheet		
but	now	we	ca	n't	watch	him		
they	saw	him	toss	his	black	mane	of	hair	they	saw	his	clenched	fist	raised	in	terrible	anger	they	heard	the	boom	of	the	words	he	spoke		
scant	years	after	he	had	written	those	prophetic	words	the	thing	was	happening		
but	the	ship	print	was	directly	in	his	line	of	vision		
to	forget	twice	in	a	row	would	be	just	too	much		
but	try	as	he	would	his	befuddled	brain	failed	to	find	the	answer		
it	was	disquieting	to	have	something	like	that	happen		
he	had	to	know	more		
he	moved	forward	rapidly		
he	could	see	it	all	now		
and	somehow	those	gruesome	statistics	seemed	tied	up	with	his	own	experience		
there	was	nothing	outside	the	window		
the	rest	of	his	house	was	gone		
the	second	shelf	contained	but	one	book		
vague	and	indistinct	yet	cast	in	stereoscopic	outline	a	gigantic	city	was	lined	against	the	darkling	sky		
the	cold	of	fear	and	horror	the	chill	of	a	half	whispered	thought		
yet	both	occupy	the	same	space	granting	then	that	the	power	of	men	's	minds	alone	holds	this	universe	or	at	least	this	world	in	its	present	form	may	we	not	go	farther	and	envision	other	minds	in	some	other	plane	watching	us	waiting	waiting	craftily	for	the	time	they	can	take	over	the	domination	of	matter		
but	those	things	he	put	away	as	items	far	removed	from	his	own	small	world		
he	read	it	again	unbelieving	for	this	should	n't	be	grant	street	but	marshall		
and	as	he	continued	to	look	something	else	seemed	to	take	form	above	that	wall		
there	was	no	bedroom		
he	opened	his	mouth	and	strained	his	vocal	cords	and	filled	his	lungs	to	bursting	with	the	urge	to	shriek	but	not	a	sound	came	from	his	lips		
now		
slowly	it	drew	together	ironed	out	its	queer	angles	readjusted	its	dimensions	became	once	again	the	stodgy	house	he	knew	it	had	to	be		
this	room	would	stay		
there	were	not	sufficient	minds	in	existence	to	retain	the	material	world	in	its	mundane	form		
again	the	fantastic	happenings	of	the	night	before	came	back	to	haunt	him	and	as	he	lay	there	staring	at	the	windows	he	remembered	them	one	by	one		
billions	of	minds	seeing	trees	as	trees	houses	as	houses	streets	as	streets	and	not	as	something	else		
something	somewhere	some	part	of	his	earlier	life	seemed	to	hold	an	explanation		
mr.		
and	when	the	rest	of	the	room	was	gone	this	corner	with	his	favorite	chair	would	remain		
like	an	automaton	he	turned	again	and	paced	to	the	hall	door		
might	not	the	street	be	as	it	always	was	with	laughing	children	and	barking	dogs		
for	a	moment	the	memory	of	happier	days	swept	over	him		
panting	he	reached	the	gate	and	stumbled	up	the	walk	thankful	that	it	still	was	there		
was	something	happening	in	the	world	which	he	in	his	secluded	life	knew	nothing	about		
and	as	he	sought	to	flee	he	stayed	in	the	one	place		
he	alone	had	furnished	it		
by	an	insidious	mass	hypnosis	minions	from	that	other	dimension	or	was	it	one	supreme	intelligence	had	deliberately	sown	the	seeds	of	dissension		
the	reduction	of	the	world	's	mental	power	had	been	carefully	planned	with	diabolic	premeditation		
was	it	his	imagination	or	did	the	lamp	on	the	table	blur	and	begin	to	fade	away		
the	timepiece	had	n't	stopped	for	it	still	ticked	audibly		
but	as	he	stared	at	it	it	became	clear	again	a	solid	substantial	thing		
he	moved	through	the	hall	to	the	door	emerged	into	the	street		
it	was	strangely	lopsided	its	dimensions	out	of	proportion	like	a	house	that	suddenly	had	gone	mad		
so	the	change	already	had	started	here		
bewildered	he	stared	down	the	next	block		
mr.		
this	room	was	for	living		
and	he	had	heard	the	shouting	of	boys	when	he	walked	by		
chambers	pushed	open	the	door	of	his	house		
here	too	he	found	what	he	had	expected		
again	he	was	alone	upon	it		
the	tree	was	there	now		
he	did	not	know	the	whole	story	he	could	not	know		
again	the	squirming	hydrophinnae	were	eating	his	foothold	piece	by	piece		
he	had	to	find	someone	who	could	tell	him		
minutes	later	he	arose	and	almost	ran	across	the	room	to	the	old	mahogany	bookcase	that	stood	against	the	wall		
he	brought	them	back	to	mind	now	and	lingered	over	the	one	central	theme	of	the	talk	he	overheard	the	wars	and	plagues		
they	thought	him	mad		
this	was	his	last	stand		
i	must	not	forget	tonight		
and	the	whole	vast	cycle	of	events	was	but	a	detail	of	a	cyclopean	plan		
mr.		
he	had	stopped	reading	newspapers	and	magazines	too	had	exiled	himself	to	a	few	city	blocks		
take	this	room	for	example		
back	at	his	own	front	door	he	stopped	and	as	he	had	done	a	thousand	times	before	drew	forth	the	heavy	gold	watch	from	his	pocket		
where	his	stolid	four	poster	and	dresser	had	been	there	was	greyish	nothingness		
chambers	slid	out	of	bed	slowly	crossed	to	the	window	the	cold	of	the	floor	biting	into	his	bare	feet		
it	was	as	if	he	ran	upon	a	treadway		
chambers	caught	some	excited	words	it	's	happening	everywhere	what	do	you	think	it	is		
there	were	other	pictures	too		
he	forced	himself	to	look	out		
chambers	had	written		
then	again	the	terror	descended	on	him	a	black	unimagined	thing	and	he	tried	to	scream	and	could	n't		
by	what	inconceivable	necromancy	could	a	paved	street	with	houses	trees	and	buildings	be	spirited	away	and	the	space	it	had	occupied	be	closed	up		
but	no	fog	however	thick	could	hide	the	apple	tree	that	grew	close	against	the	house		
something	scientists	could	not	explain		
had	his	long	exile	finally	turned	his	mind	perhaps	just	a	very	little	enough	to	make	him	queer		
two	curious	incredible	events		
on	legs	that	were	dead	things	he	stumbled	back	to	his	home		
everything	in	its	accustomed	place	the	clock	the	lamp	the	elephant	ash	tray	the	marine	print	on	the	wall		
he	remembered	one	from	many	years	before	something	about	the	martians		
but	it	had	n't	been	when	he	first	had	looked		
he	had	no	cigar		
in	a	line	stood	the	men	who	were	to	fling	themselves	into	the	light	to	be	warped	into	another	dimension	there	to	seek	out	and	fight	an	unknown	enemy		
the	head	of	the	creature	twisted	bent	backward	and	the	body	toppled	back	in	a	leisurely	manner		
perhaps	through	some	sense	which	he	as	a	being	of	another	plane	held	but	which	was	alien	to	the	earth		
come	and	i	will	show	you		
elaborate	electrical	barriers	have	failed		
ouglat	one	of	the	ancients	and	mal	shaff	reincarnated		
from	somewhere	new	force	and	life	were	flowing	into	his	body		
that	may	account	for	it		
you	said	a	short	time	ago	that	only	a	specified	dimension	could	exist	on	one	single	plane		
close	on	his	heels	followed	the	little	cockney		
questioned	the	old	man		
he	lay	still	and	stared	out	into	the	less	dark	moor	that	stretched	before	him		
like	a	flash	mal	shaff	darted	into	the	blackness	was	completely	swallowed	in	it		
time	up		
they	thought	i	was	an	old	fooli	the	man	who	alone	stands	between	them	and	utter	destruction		
mal	shaff	's	head	now	was	on	a	level	with	the	other	's	chest	his	huge	arms	seemed	toylike	in	comparison	with	those	of	ouglat	his	legs	mere	pipestems		
mal	shaff	felt	sure		
you	bloated	his	words	trailed	off	into	a	stream	of	vileness	that	could	never	have	occurred	to	a	thirddimensional	mind		
wo	n't	he	talk	at	all		
typewriters	gibbered	like	chuckling	morons	through	the	roaring	tumult	of	the	editorial	rooms		
he	remembered	it	dimly	as	being	of	great	importance		
it	is	apparent	that	while	the	horror	has	lost	one	material	dimension	it	has	retained	certain	fourthdimensional	properties	which	make	it	invulnerable	to	the	forces	at	the	command	of	our	plane		
but	the	terrible	sounds	that	came	from	between	his	slobbering	lips	were	not	those	of	his	own	voice	they	were	the	voices	of	many	men		
have	you	absolutely	no	imagination		
the	machine	thundered	steadily	with	a	suggestion	of	horrible	power		
the	tall	man	stepped	forward		
it	was	the	other	men	the	men	who	were	flinging	themselves	into	the	column	of	light	in	the	laboratory	to	be	warped	back	to	this	plane	to	be	incorporated	in	his	body		
but	pointed	out	henry	woods	you	say	they	are	fourthdimensional	things		
the	blue	light	hissing	drove	from	disk	to	disk	the	room	thundered	with	the	roar	of	the	machine	before	which	stood	dr.	white	his	hand	on	the	lever	his	eyes	glued	on	the	instruments	before	him		
he	could	have	sworn	he	had	seen	it	somewhere	before		
hanging	from	the	ceiling	directly	above	the	one	on	the	floor	was	another	concave	disk	but	this	one	had	a	far	more	pronounced	curvature		
it	was	alive	for	it	had	moved		
some	take	the	form	of	animals	others	of	birds	and	reptiles	and	some	are	cast	in	appalling	shapes	such	as	might	be	snatched	out	of	the	horrid	imagery	of	a	thing	which	resided	in	a	world	entirely	alien	to	our	own		
he	demanded		
like	an	automaton	he	placed	one	foot	on	the	disk		
from	the	fourth	dimension	to	the	third	from	the	third	to	the	second	from	the	second	to	the	first	from	the	first	to	a	questionable	existence	or	plane	which	is	beyond	our	understanding	or	perhaps	to	oblivion	and	the	end	of	life		
if	you	ca	n't	tell	me	what	you	want	us	to	publish	i	will	say	goodday		
his	fingers	closed	upon	it	and	he	drew	the	weapon		
the	principle	of	the	machine	is	the	old	man	was	about	to	launch	into	a	lengthy	discussion	but	henry	interrupted	him		
have	you	ever	thought	that	our	evolutionists	might	be	wrong	that	evolution	might	be	downward	instead	of	upward		
but	all	it	did	was	to	produce	a	slight	sting		
there	must	be	a	difference	in	time	in	the	fourth	dimension		
richards	he	said	write	a	streamer	help	needed	reinforcements	called'something	of	that	sort	you	know		
you	propose	to	warp	a	thirddimensional	being	into	a	fourth	dimension		
there	is	a	chasm	of	knowledge	between	us	so	wide	and	so	deep	that	it	staggers	the	imagination		
from	the	hinterlands	came	tales	of	murder	done	at	midnight	of	men	and	women	horribly	mangled	of	livestock	slaughtered	of	buildings	crushed	as	if	by	some	titanic	force		
if	you	ask	me	sir	they	are	a	tough	lot		
i	am	not	sending	a	thirddimensional	thing	to	a	fourth	dimension		
i	am	changing	the	thirddimensional	being	into	a	fourthdimensional	being		
yes		
he	could	no	longer	continue	this	unequal	fight		
here	in	this	one	body	were	the	bodies	the	brains	the	power	the	spirit	of	those	other	ninetyeight	men		
our	case	is	probably	paralleled	by	thousands	of	other	intelligences	on	farflung	planets	and	island	universes		
he	turned	again	to	the	reporters	who	stood	about	the	desk		
asked	the	old	man	unbelievingly		
well	tell	him	that	he	'll	have	them		
so	far	as	you	were	concerned	it	would	have	no	mass		
vaguely	yes		
his	punches	should	be	weaker		
do	you	know	anything	about	evolution		
asked	the	newspaperman		
composing	room	he	shouted	get	ready	for	a	new	front		
although	still	    	apparently	immune	to	the	weapons	being	used	against	it	it	is	    	lifting	the	siege	of	this	city		
what	can	be	done	about	it		
operator	he	said	get	me	the	secretary	of	war	at	washington		
but	he	staggered	to	his	feet	to	meet	the	charge	of	the	ancient	enemy	and	a	grim	song	a	death	chant	immeasurably	old	suddenly	and	dimly	remembered	from	out	of	the	mists	of	countless	millenniums	was	on	his	lips	as	he	swung	a	piledriver	blow	into	the	suddenly	astonished	face	of	the	rushing	ouglat	       	the	milky	globe	atop	the	machine	in	dr.	white	's	laboratory	glowed	softly	and	within	that	glow	two	figures	seemed	to	struggle		
in	desperation	ouglat	put	every	ounce	of	his	strength	into	a	heave	that	broke	the	other	's	grip	and	flung	him	away		
for	god	's	sake	do	something		
it	looked	familiar		
a	reverse	process	is	used	to	return	the	object	to	the	third		
you	can	always	jerk	them	back	sir	suggested	george		
i	know	that	some	of	the	scientists	believe	they	came	from	some	other	planet	perhaps	even	from	some	other	solar	system		
the	cause	is	unknown		
close	to	the	other	he	halted	and	only	then	did	recognition	dawn	in	his	eyes		
the	fist	finally	touched	the	head	still	moving	slowly	forward	the	body	following	as	slowly		
on	one	side	of	the	large	cube	was	set	a	lever	a	long	glass	panel	two	vertical	tubes	and	three	clockface	indicators		
ouglat	with	every	line	of	his	face	distorted	with	fear	flung	the	weapon	from	him	and	turning	fled	clumsily	down	the	moor	with	mal	shaff	at	his	heels		
tell	the	foreman	to	dig	out	the	biggest	type	he	has		
behind	him	stood	a	belligerent	little	cockney		
on	the	top	of	the	large	block	was	set	a	halfglobe	of	a	strange	substance	somewhat	henry	thought	like	frosted	glass		
a	hell	of	a	fine	reporter	you	arecan't	even	get	a	man	to	open	his	mouth		
the	old	scientist	during	all	those	hours	had	stood	like	a	graven	image	before	his	machine	eyes	staring	fixedly	at	the	globe		
if	they	came	in	a	single	conveyance	it	would	be	too	large	to	escape	detection
