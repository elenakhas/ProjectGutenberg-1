"No one would visit her," muttered Jem, who had often inveighed at the folly of social prejudice.."It will be very unromantic if you don't get anything to try your constancy," said Flossy, teasingly..Mary, the third, was slightly the cleverer of the four, and had aspirations in less obvious directions; consequently, she fulfilled the claims of her actual state in life a little less perfectly; while Kitty, the youngest, was the softest, prettiest, and most attractive of them all, and had the greatest claim to stand alone as a beauty.."Why, Flossy," said Mysie, "I think he's only what old Miss Rogers used to call `Mr Right.'"."Then you will send the children down to the Rectory, Alice?"		
I will talk to father first.".And when Hugh's thoughts took that turn he sometimes felt as if he were making a sort of secret atonement.."Oh, I did not see youII'll go!".But as she has lost the   exceptional power that made it expedient, and is still, I believe,   under eighteen, it seems desirable that she should turn her mind in   another direction..Don't you trouble yourself, Arty.		
It was of Mysie that he thought hour after hour, of her face and her voice and her sweet eyes, and of every word and look they had exchanged during their brief and sweet betrothal.."Oh, yes," said Hugh; "I wish you joy, and certainly would not be the means of interfering with your good fortune.".It was Mr Spencer who met us at Caletto..I must just cross over and speak to him.".Frederica, in her white muslin and red ribbons, was teasing Snap.		
"He mentioned you in one of his letters..But I should not have cried at it.".Had not Hugh stroked the long, soft hair?.That is to say, all his brainsand they were good oneshad been given to the composition of Greek and Latin, and to the acquirement of the knowledge necessary to the attainment of a good degree..She used to walk up and down my room and spout poetry till her eyes would flash!		
How should you like you never thought that I should be engaged to anyone?"."Well," she said, "I don't suppose you will ever make a great hand at it; but I should think you might get to act well enough not to spoil your singing if you were stronger and less frightened.".Who doesn't?".Don't you know, Violante, there is so much within us that cannot come out, and artmusicacting is a means of expressing it.."Oh, yes; Miss Venning knows her aunt, I believe."		
"Arthur," said Miss Venning, in a deep, full voice, somewhat appalling to hear, "if you had anything particular to say to Miss Crofton, you have ample opportunities without following her here.".James was so horrified with this view of Hugh's situation that he began vehemently to controvert it, and was ready to recommend a renewal of the acquaintance rather than the rejection of it on such a motive..The poor child had many weary yearning hours; but pleasure and novelty and affectionate kindness were not powerless; nor was she miserable.."Yes, but I believe there's nothing extraordinary about her..I meant to tell you.		
He had meditated much on the scene of the oliveleaves; but, in the new light thrown on Arthur's mind, it had lost much of its sting.."But flowergirls always do smile, Mr Crichton.".Her mind went on, even in these first sad days, to plans for a little lightening the cloud that covered them; and she was not a person who could sympathise with an unhappiness of which she did not thoroughly admit the necessity, or the duration of which she thought extreme..Hugh crossed the lawn, but had he wished to win Mysie for himself he could hardly have felt a bitterer pang of jealousy than that which came upon him as he looked at Arthur's gladsome eyes and heard the proud satisfaction in his tones through all their embarrassment..She had not taken so vivid an interest in each one of her pupils, nor been so anxious to extend her sphere of labour, that she could scarcely, as Flossy's sisters said, see a girl passing in the street without wanting to teach her, and had always a plea for extending some of the advantages of Oxley Manor "just this once" to some poor little outsider who stood just "next" in the social scale to those who already enjoyed them.		
"I don't know why I am talking such nonsense," he added..said Miss Venning, still judicial, but interested.."I came back because I supposed there would be things to attend to," said Hugh, in an odd unnatural voice..Of course, father, I see all the risksthey are fearful ones; but the other way is such certain misery," said Rosa, faltering..Presently he said: "I'll go and change my things.		
George and Frederica went to church again for the sake of something to do; but they could not go to the Rectory afterwards, and came home to find their aunt, James, and Miss Venning gathered round a small, unaccustomedlooking fire, with some tea on the table, while Hugh sat at the far end of the long room by himself..With fatigue and weariness such as he had never known before he stumbled over the heather, and came at last into Fordham village as the church clock struck halfpast eleven.."Sheshe may not die.".ah, she is no good at all," said Signor Mattei, mournfully"she can do nothing.".Why, what have you been doing?"		
I daresay the change will distract his mind and do him good."."Signor Mattei is not with you?"."Now go to your lessons.".Signorina, I love you; though I cannot tell you so in persuasive words..I could never give Arthur up, and there will be plenty of time for you to see, as he says he thinks thatthatthere must be a year at least.		
"Mr Fairfax is not a youth, father," said Rosa, slightly hurt; "he is fiveandthirty, and he has a very good income, which he will explain to you, himself, tonight, if you will allow him..The words fell on Violante's ears with a double sense: she hid her face in her hands, and ran out of the room, down through the olive trees, towards the lake..And James was suddenly seized with a sensation of fierce unreasonable jealousy on his brother's account.."If you please, sir, I don't know.".she said, as Rosa ventured a remonstrance.		
and, in the little laugh that followed Flossy's return to her natural inclination for argument, Arthur took his leave.."Have you read much of your own literatureDante or Tasso?"."Profanation!"."I was obliged to come up on business, and I thought I should find you heresooner or later," said Hugh, thinking his brother's excitement unnecessary..Hugh's the last fellow I should have suspected ofof" "Making such a fool of himself?"		
Hugh would not interfere, save by the brief remark: "Yes, things are wrong; but it will take more than that to set them right;" but at last he said: "You do not wish to go, Arthur?"."No, father;" answered Violante, with a sudden droop into her old timid self and falling into silence..Extravagant as was the language, there was real distress in his faltering voice and tearful eyes..For you see, Hugh, we know all about each other so well.".Violante caught the prevailing tone and worshipped Miss Florence with innocent ardour.		
"Don't you know, mother, how it was?".Rosa's fears were fulfilled..I wonder if I could make her see how to do itit seems such incredible incapacity..And then there's Hugh, who won't dance four times with a girl for fear of `exciting false expectations,' has gone and broken her heartif hearts ever are broken.."I shall go and look at her," said Emily.		
said Emily, wickedly..He was so weary of his heavy heart..She could make her dresses, too, not quite so well as the dressmaker, and was much prouder of them than of the drawing or the book either..She would have expected him to fall a victim to Violante at once..And there," taking it from the chair, "is another one for you."		
"I never would!"."What became of him?.Arthur's involuntary laugh at her naive statement died away as her question recalled the very sweetest, brightest picture of his English Mysie, in her white Sunday dress, walking down the churchyard path..Filled with a wild, exaggerated sense of bloodguiltiness, he counted up every aggravating circumstance, his old jealousy of his cousins' happinesshis impatience of their laughter and their love, the fact that he was Mysie's guardian, and so responsible for her lot, and that he had been hardly willing to trust her happiness to Arthur's care..As if I should interfere with you about it!		
said James.."I don't think he was pleased to see us," said Rosa..Arthur started up and went forward..She took Katharine away, determined to rear her up in high, stern principles, and never to allow her to become accustomed to the life of an heiress..They waited, till the Canon grew impatient, and went to look out of the window.		
Her mother made no answer, and the girl slipped away into the garden and sat down on the grass.."A friend of mine?".The place had none of the grandeur often seen on the coast, and was impressive only from a certain wild dreariness, unfelt in the sparkling sunshine of the September morning.."That is something unusual.".He, however, left two sons, who set to work in various ways to earn their own living, and from the elder of these I am descended.		
"I don't knowI had much rather get rid of it all..Poor Katharine had not much notion of that other and Higher Counsel, which her uncle's letter had advised her to seek.."Let me take advantage of it while it lasts, and ask for two dances.".The Canon smiled, and left her in the garden as he went in to speak to her mother..We have been solicitors ever since my grandfather's time, and that Kingsworth ever belonged to us is a mere tradition.		
Why should he refuse to tell her what he thought to be her duty?."Mother says she is sure thatthathe was killed," said Emberance, faintly..There was, however, part of a ruined tower on the edge of the cliff, called Kingsworth Castle, and to the old Canon the wild sweep of the wind, the dash of the waves on the rocks, and the cry of the sea birds had a charm which all the quiet of his Cathedral Close could not rival..So I am not sure if when I come of ageI ought not to give it backI haven't decided..There was a pretty Church, long and low, with a square weatherstained tower: and the Vicarage, which had hitherto been in possession of an old Vicar, who remembered the Canon's boyhood, had now fallen into other hands, and was filled with a large lively young family named Clare.		
Emberance was a little overpowered by her, but she liked her, and better still, oddly enough, she liked the grave cleareyed Aunt Mary, who looked so unjoyful, and behaved with such odd, cold graciousness towards herself..She had lost her lover, and had in fact discovered that she had never inspired him with any real affection; and life with her mother at Kingsworth seemed but a dreary prospect.."I think, Katie," said her mother, one morning when she had been for some time watching her listless attitude, "that you find it as possible to be dull at Kingsworth as at Applehurst.".Emberance had promised to take Miss Clare's class at the Sunday school in the afternoona piece of usefulness forbidden to Kate, and when she was gone silence and stiffness fell on the little party..cried the outspoken Kate.		
Why should he hate Kingsworth?.she thought..The scream of a railway whistle, even the roll of a carriage hardly ever disturbed the silence; the stockdoves cooed, and the starlings cried unstartled by any passing footsteps.."Indeed, there are times when outward beauty makes very little difference to us!".Besides, she did take the earrings.		
"It ought to be set right," said Mrs Kingsworth, steadily..I do not feel as she does, I don't think we understand enough about it to feel sure that Kingsworth should be Emberance's, andCousin Walter Kingsworth said he should give it up in my place."."I am afraid we are not domestic enough to make it ourselves," said Minnie..Dinner for all the place, and compliments to your greatgrandfather who won the place back again to the family, and Mr James so handsome and condescending like..Mrs Kingsworth, when the circumstances had been explained to her, felt a curious sense of perplexity at the discovery of an elder heir.		
And perhaps he was so, but his efforts to replace her, and his love of producing an impression had made a crisis in the life and in the character of the two Kingsworth cousins..She turned away from the path towards the Vicarage; with a shy unwillingness to be met there by herself; yet her thoughts as she walked along were not wrapped in the sunny haze proper to a young maiden just awaking to a sense of preference given and received..Are you going to have another blackberrying tomorrow?".She blushed and then continued laughing: "But you know, Major Clare, we are simpleminded country girls, and we do enjoy picking blackberries..Oh, Emmy, I wouldn't keep it and leave you to want it, for all the world."		
Her mother has kept her away from Kingsworth, taking grudgingly the least advantage from her inheritance..She says she was suspected of doing something wrong; but that it was not true.."But," said Katharine, "mamma looked at me and the tears came into her eyes, and she said, as if she hated me, `So you can enjoy pleasures your cousin does not share,' and went away.".said Walter, feeling himself in a great scrape.."I do not know," she said, "I do not know Katharine's feelings.		
Emberance doesn't like to talk about the family..She did not ask any more questions, and her agitation subsided; while to her mother's intense disappointment, she said nothing more of what had passed..Emberance was puzzled, she could not tell how the discovery had come about, and moreover, she guessed that the facts were more complicated than Kate supposed..and I have always been shut up by myself!.Still she was enough disturbed by what had passed to resolve almost for the first time in her life on consulting Canon Kingsworth.		
The morningroom in which Kate was had been Mrs Kingsworth's favourite sittingroom long ago, and was as cheerful a room as any in the house, with white panels and a carved cornice, and long windows that looked towards the village.."Did you, uncle?".There was nothing very characteristic or picturesque about the class, they wore the ordinary dress of labouring women, except that their petticoats were very short, and they were generally as rough and ignorant as might be expected of the inhabitants of a place which had enjoyed so few advantages as Kingsworth..The speaker was a tall young man of four or five and twenty, whose roundish dark eyes and hooked nose were sufficiently of the Kingsworth type to satisfy any one on the lookout for a family likeness, while his good looks and pleasant open expression were enough to account for the interest which Miss Deane was expressing in his presence at the ball; the large rooms at Mayford were all gay with lights and flowers, as the company began to assemble from all the country round, for the Deanes were popular people, and the ball a large one..She never walks on the shore.		
People are dead after seven years, you can marry somebody else even?"."Dear Kitty, I hope you won't be very dull and unhappy, after I have gone."."My dear, dear child!".The question was if it were worth keeping.."And what is your name?		
Emberance had answered warmly, and Love Lane or Hatchard's Lane, as it was called, according to the tastes of the speaker, always brought her promise to her mind..She was pickingand eatingblackberries with all her might, comparing her basket with her companions', scratching her fingers, and tearing her gown with the most entire enjoyment..The Canon did not, she thought, write freely to her; she could not, except under great stress of feeling, discuss the matter with Emberance, and of her mother's stern, clear view she had an instinctive dread..She looked up with that in her eyes, which, had he met them, must have brought the scene to a point at once, and given it a very different ending..But remember, the time was so short that he may have   been only waiting for a favourable opportunity.		
"Walter may have another opportunity of judging if he likes," said his father..She liked attention, and, as a pretty halfgrown girl, had met with a good deal; but she did not intend finally to yield except to an ideal youth, the colour of whose hair, and the expression of whose eyes had been accurately decided upon, while his admiration of herself was to be evident from their first meeting..Walter could have bitten his tongue out for his imprudence..She did not understand it..She could hardly grasp her own thought, to express it was still more difficult.		
"Ohbecause of friends," said Kate.."But you will not retract, Katharine, you will not fall again into temptation?."Will you dance with me, Miss Kingsworth?".She was small and rather short, with the sort of birdlike air, always given by a delicately hooked nose, and round dark eyes set rather close together..She was a tall woman, with a figure slender and elance as that of a girl, delicate, regular features, and a small head adorned with an abundance of smooth, dark hair.		
But Kate had not come to the point of perceiving that any particular line of action could be expected of her..He has no one belonging to him to keep him in England..And he went, though somehow his sisters could extract no more enthusiasm from him on the subject of the southcountry cousins..She stopped a minute in her walk, and looked over the hedge across the cabbages in Hatchard's market garden, and said to herself, "I'm not bearing it, I'm trying to escape it.."Refused him?"		
we shouldn't come to gather blackberries if they were of no use!."Dear, dear Emmy, I should like you to have one too," she said..She was to go home in time for Christmas, and at home would be much more likely to pick up fragments of intelligence..And mamma would not consentso how could I get there?.Emberance glanced at her, and said, "Kitty, we mustn't stay for tea, it is so dark, let us go home.		
Emberance found things pleasant enough, but she felt as if there were years of life between herself and her cousin, as she thought of Malcolm Mackenzie's ship tossing on the waves which never rose without costing her an unreasonable sense of apprehension.."We will speak of it again in Council."."Surely," said Enrique, "it is possible, if it were God's will, but," he added, colouring with enthusiasm, "I think, we are so well prepared, it is not likely.".The inhabitants of Ceuta were to be offered the choice of leaving the city or of submitting to the Christian rule.."As to that, my good lords," said Northberry, "I care not for degradation, if I can but get my poor little maid back.		
England still felt the benefit of the strong government of Henry the Fifth, and all was at peace..Then the voice that was always gentle, the words that were always pure, the faith that saw beyond the dungeon walls, would woo them to a better mind; and the love they bore him helped them to hold to the love of God; and when, now and again, by the faint light of their little lamp, Father Jose took of the good Majorcan's bread and wine, and celebrated the Holy Eucharist, as long ago it had been celebrated by martyrs and confessors in dens and caves of the earth, they felt the power of that Holy Presence, and attained to something of the martyr's spirit as well as the martyr's fate..The sun also dropped down to rest over another small inclosure, far away in the warm south.."But now, Sir Walter, I came here today to speak with you ofof the foul treason that cut off our retreat, and made my brother's sacrifice necessary.."Take Tangier and there will be none."		
"It was very stupid of Hassan not to send men who can do their work..Of course the party who contended for the retention of Ceuta contained many who cared nothing for the religious question, but who declared openly that the great seaport was worth far more to the state than the precarious life of a prince who had never been able to make himself prominent or useful, while many of those who wished to yield it cared little for Fernando, and less for the pledge, but were only anxious to avoid the expense of a war.."My Arthur, whom I shall not see   Till all my widowed race be run.".It was their most peaceful moment, for they could then talk freely with each other.."Go, bring me showers of rosesbring."		
The king convoked the StatesGeneral of Portugal, and a great council was held to decide on the next step.."Where is the false traitor to whom this is owing?".But I saw no one who, to my mind, equalled our cousin King Harry, now alas!.The sun sank below the horizon, the purple headland of Turo came into view, one by one the stars came out in the deep clear sky; while at the prow of each vessel was hung a great lantern, so that in the gathering darkness the fleet seemed almost as if composed of ships of fire..Alack!		
"If we were only going too!".cried Leila.."I know it," returned Enrique; but he said no more, only anxiously watching while one of his chaplains, Father Jose, who, like most priests, was something of a surgeon, bound up the injured hand, saying that it was after all but a trifle..I will not yield the Lady Eleanor to a traitor, nor see my prince's confidence abused by a foreigner.".Certainly, Christian land must not be given up to an infidel power; but he offered the muchdesired full of Crusade, and recommended Duarte to go to war to deliver his brother.		
"Doubtless it is well; but now, submission is hard."."Will you now write and urge on your brother to deliver youthat loving brother who has let you pine in a dungeon rather than yield a fortress for your sake?"."And youhow can you bear the march over these hot sands?.How she wished that she had never teased Harry by encouraging his rivalfor as such she began to recognise Alvarez; and though she scarcely realised that Harry wished her to be more to him than his old playmate, he had always been jealous of interference, and the feelings of Alvarez were unmistakable..he cried.		
There was something provoking to his common sense in the illmanagement of the start; and though he had no expectation of failure, it afforded him great satisfaction to grumble at the princes, and even at the king, by way perhaps of showing that he was not a Portuguese subject..With the rights and wrongs of that unhappy story, a sadder one perhaps than the fatal siege of Tangier, we have now no concern; but some strange change must have passed over the mind of the nation, for no other effort was ever made to rescue Fernando.."Afraid!.My mind misgave me when we landed as to our numbers; and now I find that, instead of the fourteen thousand ordered to embark, we have but eight!.Fernando looked satisfied, and then demanded if Enrique thought that the Moors were really maneaters.		
We still work together."."My sons!".Stand still," shouted Enrique, springing to his feet, and, in a moment, he rushed forward, climbed on to the high prow of the ship, and clinging on with one hand, with the other he detached the burning lantern, and flung it into the sea.."Tell me one thing," said Harry; "Dom Alvarez accuses me of a share in the treason that rained my beloved prince..Where is Father Martin?"		
said Fernando, "and we may yet clasp hands again..cried the first speaker..There was a vessel bound from France to Lisbon came to the rescue, and beat them off; but oh, the saints pity us!."Tell him," said Fernando, "to remember that both he and I are Christian princes, soldiers of the Cross of Christ.."I don't think," said Fernando, "that your gentlemen here think of converting them."		
The horseshoe arch of the window framed a piece of deep blue sky, against which a gilded dome, surmounted by a crescent, glittered in the morning sun..Harry was a straightforward youth, who disliked what he could not understand.."Can I forget my childish vow, and the longing I have ever had so to devote myself?.Presently Fernando beheld, leaning over the gardenwall, the same maiden who had given him the milk..And Enrique, our soldiers love you, as my good father and uncle were loved; look ever to their welfare, nor ever regard them as churls and their deaths of no account."		
I felt that he was of our kin, for he had our blessed mother's face, whom I think Fernando favours most of us all..We must push on at once, and trust in the force of our onslaught?".If he authorised the war, and would give a Bull of Crusade, well and good; if not, the project must be abandoned..What mattered the scene that had passed to Fernando; what mattered insult and hardship, compared to the sorrow and anguish of heart of reading of the beloved brother's illness and death!."But the treaty?"		
"Scorn will not give us a better supper than black bread; see, here are dates, to flavour it," said Dom Francisco, while the first speaker, an older man, snatched the gift from his hand and flung it away; and there was a disproportionate outcry of annoyance and vexation.."I want to hear about Catalina..Certainly if deliverance ever came for himself and his friends she might be included in it..Woe's me that ever I let them go."."He does not revive," said the girl.		
At last, hearing sounds without, she sent one of her maids to inquire if her father had returned, and in a moment Sir Walter came into the room..Sir Walter set down his daughters, who retreated, handinhand, under a great orangetree; while their father rose and went to the door, as he heard horses stopping without..Brother Martin's passionate preaching had really stirred his emotions, and made him feel himself a true Crusader..My brother, the king, has none such in his stable.."Nella?"		
Who can authorise the inmost promptings of the soul that lead to great ends?.She turned her head away and cried bitterly, while Harry was dumb for a moment; for if she had told him that she was married already, there would hardly have been a greater barrier between them..We were young and untried when we took Ceuta; it is little likely that we should now fail.".She was almost too much for the nuns sometimes, with her wild spirits and dauntless gaiety, delighting in woodland scrambles and hairbreadth escapes..But, prince though he was, Enrique met with scant sympathy beyond the limits of his family, in designs which the world had not yet learnt to understand.		
"You did not think so when Ceuta was before you."."Into my house he comes not if he takes the traitor's name on his lips," said Northberry..Dom Enrique had been but little at Lisbon, his great undertakings filled up his time, and he had of late joined the King of Aragon in a war with the Duke of Milan, during which he had been taken prisoner, to the great alarm and distress of his brothers; but he had soon regained his liberty, and now, at the end of 1435, was at the court..He spoke, however, in the council well and to the point, urging his view of what number would be sufficient for the attack, and the reasons why he thought that it should be made..There were times when, treated like brutes as they were, the animal nature awoke within them, and they were ready to tear each other to pieces in the bitterness of their despairing fury; other times, when they sought a kind of relief in wild ribald jests, and many long intervals of sulky, faithless despair; when even Father Jose's prayers and encouragements were unavailing.		
Not a prisoner too?"."Poor Christian," she said, "here is some milk for you.."So," he said, "Ceuta, praise be to God, is ours, fortress and all, for ZalabenZala fled in the night, and before I came here Duarte and Pedro were there in command.."It seems as if our prayers must be weak when we withhold ourselves..In a few moments he returned, accompanied by a tall, slender young man, dressed in black velvet, with a red cross on his breast.
