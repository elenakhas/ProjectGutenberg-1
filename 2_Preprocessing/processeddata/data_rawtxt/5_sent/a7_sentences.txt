Why, I’ve often watched a ploughman, with two horses harnessed to the plough, doing his best to get it forwards; while the oppositionploughman, with three donkeys harnessed at the other end, was doing his best to get it backwards!.Go and brush it toreckly!’ Then—‘Oh, Bruno, oo mustn’t dog’sear the daisies!’ Did oo learn oor spelling wiz daisies, Mister Sir?” I want to hear about that Boy’s Birthday,” I said..If she loves him truly,” (I seemed at last to grasp the clue to the problem) is not that, for her, the voice of God?.Why, of course you can!” Sylvie exclaimed..After all, I’m afraid there’s no part for you but the ‘Welldressed Villain’: only,” with a critical sideglance, I’m a leetle uncertain about the dress!” We found Lady Muriel alone, the Earl having gone out to make a call, and at once resumed old terms of intimacy, in the shady arbour where the teathings seemed to be always waiting.		
They look like troops of hovering angels!” To me they looked very ordinary clouds indeed: but then I had not fed ‘on honeydew, And drunk the milk of Paradise’!.What is it like?” Almost exactly like this one..Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast!’ Down came the little Foxes!.As we passed the head of the lane that led down to the beach, I noticed a single figure, moving slowly along it, seawards..And so Bruno went back to the Lion.		
If A promises something to B, B has a claim upon A..We call it ‘Artificial Selection.’” Exactly so,” said Mein Herr..336   Eternity, contemplation of..Pray don’t disturb yourself..Why, I had nearly forgotten the most important part of the entertainment!		
Thank you so much for coming out to tell me!” And, thinking he had now said all he had come to say, I held out my hand to bid him good night..And be very good and obedient.’ The Lamb’s speech..There each would find a comfortable room provided for her, and also a cheap secondhand pianoforte, on which she might play for hours, without adding one needless pang to the sum of human misery!” Lady Muriel glanced round in alarm, lest these barbarous sentiments should be overheard..Hip!.Bird thou never wert,   That from Heaven, or near it,     Pourest thy full heart!’” he read from the page he had spread open before her.		
However, it took in one of her audience, and Bruno hastened to interpose, as peacemaker in a rising quarrel, with the remark I likes Peoples!” Arthur laid a loving hand on the little curly head..And Bruno was ever so frightened, and he ran——” No, he wasn’t flightened a bit!” Bruno interrupted..Crabbed age and youth cannot live together!” the old man cheerfully replied, with a most genial smile..Quick!.Why, that’s true!” he murmured to himself.		
That’s Sylvie singing!.Bruno’s speech to the Lion..It isn’t as hot as it might be,” the Professor replied, catching at the first idea that came to hand..Hadn’t it?” he enquired..I could explain it in—in—but you would not understand it!” No indeed!” said Lady Muriel, graciously dispensing with the name of the unknown language.		
Assuming it to have no moral responsibility, isn’t that a greater mystery than a man overdriving a horse?” I think it is,” said Lady Muriel, looking a mute appeal to her father..Now let me ask you another question..It’s too important a question to be settled by Amateurs!.Something wonderful—like  Fortunatus’s Purse?.After the Examination, he mentioned to me the few facts which he knew but had not been able to bring in, and I can assure you they were trivial, Sir, absolutely trivial!” I feebly expressed my surprise and delight.		
There were only some eight or nine left—to whom the Count was explaining, for the twentieth time, how he had had his eye on the children during the last verse of the song; how he had then glanced round the room, to see what effect de great chestnote” had had upon his audience; and how, when he looked back again, they had both disappeared—when exclamations of dismay began to be heard on all sides, the Count hastily bringing his story to an end to join in the outcry..They are either vapid or controversial..Good night, little ones!” said the Professor..Instead of saying ‘what book shall I write?’ an author will ask himself ‘which book shall I write?’ A mere verbal distinction!” Lady Muriel gave me an approving smile..To shelter the sane!” said Arthur.		
And he went to buy some sweeties in a shop..And the old Sheep said ‘Do you know your A B C yet?.The Professor looked at his watch..‘Care,’ you know, killed the Cat..Three cheers for the Emperor!” The faintest possible sound followed this announcement: and the Chancellor, with admirable presence of mind, instantly proclaimed A speech from the Emperor!” The Emperor had begun his speech almost before the words were uttered.		
There certainly was a sort of witchery of beauty about them..Course he knows no better, if he’s Flench!.It’s difficult to get things started,” the Professor remarked to Bruno..We would not concern ourselves..Then chorus agin!” was shouted out by one of the redfaced men in the window: and forthwith a dozen voices yelled, to a harsh discordant melody, the refrain:—   There’s him, an’ yo’ an’ me,             Roarin’ laddies!		
I like to think of you as an old friend,” (—though you don’t look it!” would have been the almost necessary sequence, with any other lady; but she and I seemed to have long passed out of the time when compliments, or any such trivialities, were possible.).It has Introductory Verses at the beginning, and at the end.” It ca’n’t have Introductory Verses at the end, can it?” said Sylvie..Sylvie!” he said, in a perfectly audible whisper..And when it had nubbled all his head off, he went away, and he never said ‘thank you’!” That were very rude,” said Bruno..By this time the other guests had arrived; and dinner was announced.		
This must be looked into,” he muttered to himself, taking out a notebook..Do you know, I think we began as old friends?” she said with a playfulness of tone that ill accorded with the tears that glistened in her eyes..That jump would take it at least five miles!.Who then are these dear children, I pray you?” he said..Say that took ten times as long (you see we have unlimited time to deal with).		
Something about a duck?” I hazarded..No bad news, Sir, I hope?” my landlady said, as she saw me out..And, when he had got a little way, he thought he would look into the hamper, and see how the little Foxes were getting on.” So he opened the door——” said Bruno..Is that all?” I asked, despondingly..I entirely agree with you,” said Lady Muriel: but don’t orthodox writers condemn that view, as putting Man on the level of the lower animals?		
It is a melancholy pleasure to place on record the names of these genuine martyrs—than whom none, surely, are more worthy to be entered on the gloryroll of England’s heroes!.Little Birds are playing       Bagpipes on the shore,       Where the tourists snore:   Thanks!” they cry..I heard it had all come to an end.” I would like to tell you how it happened,” she said; as that is the very point I want your advice about..Is it Life or Death?” I asked him, as soon as we were far enough from the house for me to speak in ordinary tones..For instance, if I were to say ‘Here we are!’, that would be accepted without any contradiction, and it’s a nice sort of remark to begin a conversation with.		
I asked that foreigner to take her in, because he’s very musical, too..When the Other Professor had recited this Verse, he went across to the fireplace, and put his head up the chimney..Who shall stop him?.‘The funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriagetables,’” I could not help repeating to myself..About a thousand and four,” said Bruno.		
How many Axioms are you going to give us?.I don’t like Owls..Suppose you discover a remedy for some disease hitherto supposed to be incurable..It were too tiny,” he repeated..You needn’t be afraid of me!		
But no man, in his senses—” (he looked sternly round the table, as if defying contradiction) —ever yet discussed WINE with a lady!” He sipped his glass of port, leaned back in his chair, and slowly raised it up to his eye, so as to look through it at the lamp..What they were I could not at all make out, but some mysterious change seemed instantly to pass over us..I’m agoan whoam.” What, withouten thy drink, Willie man?” shouted the others..one would cry, 'I forgot to wind up my heart this morning!.'Bless me!'		
No man would ever do such a thing), "put 'Wednesday' simply as the date!.What care we take about feeding the lucky body!.It looks pale, and the pulse is very slow.'.But the greater the exertion the more valuable, we may be sure, is the effect..And then, as to the mastication of the food, the mental process answering to this is simply thinking over what we read.		
*       *       *       *       * Then, again, though the food be wholesome and in proper amount, we know that we must not consume too many kinds at once..I had to let them stand over from last week, being so busy, and my doctor says he will not answer for the consequences if I wait any longer!'.*       *       *       *       * Considering the amount of painful experience many of us have had in feeding and dosing the body, it would, I think, be quite worth our while to try and translate some of the rules into corresponding ones for the mind..Take the thirsty a quart of beer, or a quart of cider, or even a quart of cold tea, and he will probably thank you (though not so heartily in the last case!)..You go out three times for wanst that you come in!"'		
Years ago I used to receive letters from a friendand very interesting letters toowritten in one of the most atrocious hands ever invented..Up comes a handful of very promising facts, but on examination they turn out to belong to the wrong century, and are pitched in again..Did you ever know a circulating decimal come to an end?'        *       *       *       *       * Rule 5.'If your friend makes a severe remark, either leave it unnoticed, or make your reply distinctly less severe; and if he makes a friendly remark, tending towards making up the little difference that has arisen between you, let your reply be distinctly more friendly..To think that it has been standing still for the last three hours!'.Which of us does as much for his mind?		
'A great deal of the bad writing in the world comes simply from writing too quickly..It is astonishing what an amount of impetus and elasticity the mind recovers during those short periods of rest..You can't puzzle him.'.And when several had been thus guessed the context would help one with the others, till at last the whole series of hieroglyphics was deciphered..If all one's friends wrote like that, life would be entirely spent in reading their letters!'		
Is the body so much the more important of the two?.This will often lead to your writing it all over again, taking out a lot of the vinegar and pepper and putting in honey instead, and thus making a much more palatable dish of it!'.I really think I have met with one or two: minds which could not keep up with the slowest trot in conversation; could not jump over a logical fence, to save their lives; always got stuck fast in a narrow argument; and, in short, were fit for nothing but to waddle helplessly through the world..*       *       *       *       * 'If, in picking a quarrel, each party declined to go more than threeeighths of the way, and if in making friends, each was ready to go fiveeighths of the waywhy, there would be more reconciliations than quarrels!.Then we should be careful to provide this wholesome food in proper amount.		
And what causes the difference?.You ask him a question, say, in English history (he is understood to have just finished reading Macaulay)..'Why, what have you been doing with this mind lately?.Meanwhile, every one is waiting for his reply, and, as the silence is getting more and more awkward, our wellread friend has to stammer out some halfanswer at last, not nearly so clear or so satisfactory as an ordinary schoolboy would have given..But what think you his feelings would be if you offered him a tray containing a little mug of beer, a little mug of cider, another of cold tea, one of hot tea, one of coffee, one of cocoa, and corresponding vessels of milk, water, brandyandwater, and buttermilk?		
It would fare but ill with many of us if we were left to superintend our own digestion and circulation..I used to carry it about in my pocket and take it out at leisure times, to puzzle over the riddles which composed itholding it in different positions and at different distances, till at last the meaning of some hopeless scrawl would flash upon me, when I at once wrote down the English under it..Take care now!.A second haul brings up a fact much more like the real thing, but, unfortunately, along with it comes a tangle of other thingsa fact in political economy, a rule in arithmetic, the ages of his brother's children, and a stanza of Gray's 'Elegy,' and among all these, the fact he wants has got hopelessly twisted up and entangled..This is a very much greater exertion of mind than the mere passive taking in the contents of our Author.		
'Sugarplums!.And many a mind that hurries through book after book, without waiting to digest or arrange anything, gets into that sort of condition, and the unfortunate owner finds himself far from fit really to support the character all his friends give him..To repeat your arguments all over again, will simply lead to his doing the same, and so you will go on like a circulating decimal..Can you doubt him?.Rule for correspondence that has, unfortunately, become controversial.		
Of course you reply, "I do it to save time.".We very soon learn what will, and what will not, agree with the body, and find little difficulty in refusing a piece of the tempting pudding or pie which is associated in our memory with that terrible attack of indigestion, and whose very name irresistibly recalls rhubarb and magnesia; but it takes a great many lessons to convince us how indigestible some of our favourite lines of reading are, and again and again we make a meal of the unwholesome novel, sure to be followed by its usual train of low spirits, unwillingness to work, weariness of existencein fact, by mental nightmare..Well, it is, I say, for us that the consequences of neglecting the body can be clearly seen and felt; and it might be well for some if the mind were equally visible and tangibleif we could take it, say, to the doctor, and have its pulse felt..First a mouthful of novel; but no, faugh!.While Lewis Carroll was staying in the house, there came to call a certain genial and by no means shy Dean, who, without realizing what he was doing, proceeded, in the presence of other callers, to make some remark identifying Mr. Dodgson as the author of his books. There followed an immense explosion immediately on the visitor's departure, with a pathetic and serious request that, if there were any risk of a repetition of the call, due warning might be given, and the retreat secured. Probably not many readers of the immortal Alice have ever seen the curious little whimsical paper called   EIGHT OR NINE WISE WORDS ABOUT LETTERWRITING which their author had printed and used to send to his acquaintance, accompanied by a small case for postagestamps. It consists of forty pages, and is published by Emberlin and Son, Oxford; and these are the contents:                                     PAGE   ON STAMPCASES,                      5   HOW TO BEGIN A LETTER,               8   HOW TO GO ON WITH A LETTER,         11   HOW TO END A LETTER,                20   ON REGISTERING CORRESPONDENCE,      22 In this little script, also, there are the same sparkles of wit which betoken that nimble pen, as, for example, under 'How to begin a Letter': '"And never, never, dear madam" (N.B.This remark is addressed to ladies only.		
So the beautifullywritten MS., in his customary violet ink, has been treasured for more than twenty years, only now and then being read over at Christmastime to a friend or two by the study fire, always to meet with the same welcome and glad acknowledgment that here was a genuine, though little flame that could not have belonged to any other source but that which all the world knew in Alice in Wonderland and Through the LookingGlass.."That way madness lies!"' From section 3: 'How to go on with a Letter.'.'Don't repeat yourself.When once you have had your say fully and clearly on a certain point, and have failed to convince your friend, drop that subject..Isn't his time as valuable as yours?.It generally took me about a week to read one of his letters!		
By no means: but life depends on the body being fed, whereas we can continue to exist as animals (scarcely as men) though the mind be utterly starved and neglected..You turn to the thoroughly wellread man..'I can't walk with you this afternoon,' a friend would say, 'as I have no less than eleven dinners to digest..A very good object, no doubt, but what right have you to do it at your friend's expense?.And just consider another effect of this thorough digestion of the books we read; I mean the arranging and 'ticketing,' so to speak, of the subjects in our minds, so that we can readily refer to them when we want them.		
Sam Slick tells us that he has learnt several languages in his life, but somehow 'couldn't keep the parcels sorted' in his mind..One hour of steady thinking over a subject (a solitary walk is as good an opportunity for the process as any other) is worth two or three of reading only..So much greater an exertion is it, that, as Coleridge says, the mind often 'angrily refuses' to put itself to such troubleso much greater, that we are far too apt to neglect it altogether, and go on pouring in fresh food on the top of the undigested masses already lying there, till the unfortunate mind is fairly swamped under the flood..Do you know the unfortunate victim of illjudged mental feeding when you see him?.*       *       *       *       * Rule 6.'Don't try to get the last word....		
He smiles goodnaturedly, tries to look as if he knew all about it, and proceeds to dive into his mind for the answer..I have heard a physician telling his patientwhose complaint was merely gluttony and want of exercisethat 'the earliest symptom of hypernutrition is a deposition of adipose tissue,' and no doubt the fine long words greatly consoled the poor man under his increasing load of fat..(N.B.If you are a gentleman and your friend a lady, this rule is superfluous: You won't get the last word!)'        *       *       *       *       * Let the last word today be part of another rule, which gives a glimpse into that gentle heart: 'When you have written a letter that you feel may possibly irritate your friend, however necessary you may have felt it to so express yourself, put it aside till the next day..What kind?'.No novels on any account!'		
'Well, doctor, it has not had much regular food lately..Which is like the Irishman's remonstrance to his gadabout daughter: "Shure, you're always goin' out!.First, then, we should set ourselves to provide for our mind its proper kind of food..First, as to the intervals: these are as really necessary as they are for the body, with this difference only, that while the body requires three or four hours' rest before it is ready for another meal, the mind will in many cases do with three or four minutes..I gave it a lot of sugarplums yesterday.'		
'Well, they were a parcel of conundrums, sir.'.'A thoroughly wellread man..Look at him drearily wandering round a readingroom, tasting dish after dishwe beg his pardon, book after bookkeeping to none..The sum total might be a quart, but would it be the same thing to the haymaker?.W. H. D. November 1907. FEEDING THE MIND Breakfast, dinner, tea; in extreme cases, breakfast, luncheon, dinner, tea, supper, and a glass of something hot at bedtime.		
'Ah, I thought so..Therefore Nature provides that, in case of serious neglect of the body, such terrible consequences of discomfort and pain shall ensue, as will soon bring us back to a sense of our duty: and some of the functions necessary to life she does for us altogether, leaving us no choice in the matter..'Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus   Tam cari capitis?'.*       *       *       *       * Having settled the proper kind, amount, and variety of our mental food, it remains that we should be careful to allow proper intervals between meal and meal, and not swallow the food hastily without mastication, so that it may be thoroughly digested; both which rules, for the body, are also applicable at once to the mind..There may be, perhaps, many others who, gathering round a winter fire, will be glad to read words, however few, from that bright source, and whose memories will respond to the fresh touch of that cherished name. It remains to add but one or two more associations that cling to it and make the remembrance more vivid still.		
I wonder if there is such a thing in nature as a FAT MIND?.At length the curtain rose upon       ‘Bombastes Furioso.’    In vain we roared; in vain we tried       To rouse her into laughter:    Her pensive glances wandered wide       From orchestra to rafter—    Tier upon tier!” she said, and sighed;       And silence followed after..Goodnight, old Turniptop, goodnight!.If that be so,” she straight replied,    Each heart with each doth coincide..What boots it?		
In lodgings by the Sea..And cannot friends be firm and fast,          And yet bear parting?.But what’s the use?”  (He heaved a sigh.).Explain yourself, my man!”    His name is Kobold,” said my guest:          One of the Spectre order:    You’ll very often see him dressed    In a yellow gown, a crimson vest,          And a nightcap with a border..Why not endure, expecting more?”    Rather than that,” he groaned aghast,    I’d writhe in depths of cavern vast,    Some loathly vampire’s rich repast.”                        [Picture: He groaned aghast]    ’Twere hard,” it answered, themes immense    To coop within the narrow fence    That rings thy scant intelligence.”    Not so,” he urged, nor once alone:    But there was something in her tone    That chilled me to the very bone.		
For five lang years, and five lang years,       I coorted thee by looks;    By nods and winks, by smiles and tears,       As I had read in books..Let thy scant knowledge find increase..And, sickened with excess of dread,    Prone to the dust he bent his head,    And lay like one threequarters dead    The whisper left him—like a breeze    Lost in the depths of leafy trees—    Left him by no means at his ease..You’re getting as familiar          As if you were my cousin!.You’d find the bread improved, I think,          By getting better flour:    And have you anything to drink    That looks a little less like ink,          And isn’t quite so sour?”    Then, peering round with curious eyes,          He muttered Goodness gracious!”    And so went on to criticise—    Your room’s an inconvenient size:          It’s neither snug nor spacious.		
Say, can thy noble spirit stoop    To join the gormandising troup    Who find a solace in the soup?.FROM his shoulder Hiawatha    Took the camera of rosewood,    Made of sliding, folding rosewood;    Neatly put it all together..And if Bones plagues him anyhow—          Squeaking and all the rest of it,    As he was doing here just now—    I prophesy there’ll be a row,          And Tibbs will have the best of it!”               [Picture: And Tibbs will have the best of it]    Then, as my tears could never bring          The friendly Phantom back,    It seemed to me the proper thing    To mix another glass, and sing          The following Coronach..Goodnight, old Turniptop, goodnight!”          A nod, and he was gone..I’ll have no bonfires on my floor—    And, as for scratching at the door,          I’d like to see you try!”    The Third was written to protect          The interests of the Victim,    And tells us, as I recollect,    To treat him with a grave respect,          And not to contradict him.”    That’s plain,” said I, as Tare and Tret,          To any comprehension:    I only wish some Ghosts I’ve met    Would not so constantly forget          The maxim that you mention!”    Perhaps,” he said, you first transgressed          The laws of hospitality:    All Ghosts instinctively detest    The Man that fails to treat his guest          With proper cordiality.		
A while like one in dreams he stood,    Then faltered forth his gratitude    In words just short of being rude:    For it had lost its shape and shine,    And it had cost him fourandnine,    And he was going out to dine..No need for Bones to hurry so!”          I sobbed..He gazed upon the sleeping sea,    And joyed in its tranquillity,    And in that silence dead, but she    To muse a little space did seem,    Then, like the echo of a dream,    Harked back upon her threadbare theme..And hear dumb shrieks that fill the air;    See mouths that gape, and eyes that stare    And redden in the dusky glare?.[Picture: He ran to tell the King]    When it was over, for a whim,          He ran to tell the King;    And being the reverse of slim,    A twomile trot was not for him          A very easy thing.		
Ye never telled me sae.”    Said—Ladye dear,” and the salt, salt tear       Cam’ rinnin’ doon his cheek,    I have sent the tokens of my love       This many and many a week..That is, the Present Company.”    Baffled, she gave a wolfish bark:    He, aiming blindly in the dark,    With random shaft had pierced the mark..[Picture: Next to him the eldest daughter]       Next to him the eldest daughter:    She suggested very little,    Only asked if he would take her    With her look of ‘passive beauty.’       Her idea of passive beauty    Was a squinting of the lefteye,    Was a drooping of the righteye,    Was a smile that went up sideways    To the corner of the nostrils..How shall I write in rhyme?.Where have you been by it most annoyed?		
For truly, just as the genuine Epicure lingers lovingly over a morsel of supreme Venison—whose every fibre seems to murmur Excelsior!”—yet swallows, ere returning to the toothsome dainty, great mouthfuls of oatmealporridge and winkles: and just as the perfect Connoisseur in Claret permits himself but one delicate sip, and then tosses off a pint or more of boardingschool beer: so also—    I NEVER loved a dear Gazelle—       Nor anything that cost me much:    High prices profit those who sell,       But why should I be fond of such?.He answered her he knew not what:    Like shaft from bow at random shot,    He spoke, but she regarded not..It’s not in Nursery Rhymes?.Instead          Of answering my question,    Well, if you don’t know that,” he said,    Either you never go to bed,          Or you’ve a grand digestion!.The man that smokes—that reads the Times—    That goes to Christmas Pantomimes—    Is capable of any crimes!”    He felt it was his turn to speak,    And, with a shamed and crimson cheek,    Moaned This is harder than Bezique!”    But when she asked him Wherefore so?”    He felt his very whiskers glow,    And frankly owned I do not know.”                  [Picture: This is harder than Bezique!]		
The notion soon became a craze;          And, when it once began, she    Brought us all out in different ways—    One was a Pixy, two were Fays,          Another was a Banshee;    The Fetch and Kelpie went to school          And gave a lot of trouble;    Next came a Poltergeist and Ghoul,    And then two Trolls (which broke the rule),          A Goblin, and a Double—    (If that’s a snuffbox on the shelf,”          He added with a yawn,    I’ll take a pinch)—next came an Elf,    And then a Phantom (that’s myself),          And last, a Leprechaun..[Picture: First the Governor, the Father]       Next, his better half took courage;    She would have her picture taken..And must I then, at Friendship’s call,    Calmly resign the little all    (Trifling, I grant, it is and small)          I have of gladness,    And lend my being to the thrall          Of gloom and sadness?.Don’t stir!” he cried..I coorted thee by signs;    By sending game, by sending flowers,       By sending Valentines.
