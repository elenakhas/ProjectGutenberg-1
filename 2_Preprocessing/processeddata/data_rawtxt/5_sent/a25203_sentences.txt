The liberals have gotten the upper hand..He didn't laugh again..He gestured at the two in the street..He woke from a restless sleep and saw a small thing skittering toward him..There had only been time to dart in, snatch a bow and a few arrows and an axe.		
He fought the war of all which was old and primitive and lost in its own dreams against the alien and the desecrator..Rain forests of Venus and the coughing roar of a manylegged swamp monster crashing through the trees to the place where he stood waiting..Shaking, he peered into the trap..Kreega collapsed on a shelf of rock..His nostrils dilated with excitement, a high keen drunkenness that sang wonderfully within him.		
The rockhound was like a gaunt wolf, but hugebreasted and feathered, a tracker as good as any Terrestrial bloodhound..But the human had to come near first There he came, running and bounding over the rocks, rifle in hand and restless eyes shining with taut green light, closing in for the death..And the wild Martians made fine sportintelligent game, that could get away as often as not, or even manage to kill the hunter.".He rasped a curse on the human and resumed his patient work, chipping a spearhead for what puny help it could give him..For a moment, the warrior Kreega was gone and a lonely, frightened infant sobbed in the desert silence.		
When Ares lifted its hard spires above the hills of Syrtis, where then were the ancient gods of Mars?.The man was a tiny speck in the huge barren landscape, a lonely insect crawling under the deepblue sky..Naturally, one of their first reforms was to end Martian slavery.".They're just stupid laborers, as dependent on our civilization as we are..They weren't able toto empathize the Martians, or whatever you call it.		
The Martian was nowhere in sight, but a faint red trail led into the rugged hill country..He checked his other equipment..They wore only pouched belts and carried sheath knives; even the liberals of Earth weren't ready to allow the natives modern tools and weapons..They were getting close..He batted at the creature with his spear and dodged around a tree.		
But once he had landed, he was safehe could always claim to be peacefully exploring, hunting leapers or some such thing..With a savage thrill, Kreega saw the arrow go through the hound, saw the creature leap in the air and then roll over and over, howling and biting at the thing in its breast..But Riordan was close enough to him now so that the hound could follow his spoor, for Mars had no watercourses to break a trail..But it isn't enough!.Somewhere the soft trill of a sandrunner echoed between low windworn cliffs, and the brush began to speak, whispering back and forth in its ancient wordless tongue.		
A real oldtime warrior who hates Earthmen's guts..For an instant a gray form loomed over the edge, hurled a spear at him..A city dweller from Earth would give you a better fight.".They were native beasts, long ago domesticated by the Martians and later by man..The trail looked clear and fresh now.		
Riordan roared and lashed out with a fist..Mars was dark at night, its moons of little helpPhobos a hurtling speck, Deimos merely a bright star..The spear glanced off the tough fabric of his suit and he scrambled up a narrow ledge to the top of the precipice..Not that that was likelyhe'd have to find shelter somewhere too, if he didn't want to freeze..The brush rustled and something wailed in darkness and the wind blew with a wild mournful sound over faintly starlit cliffs, and it was as if they all somehow had voice, as if the whole world muttered and threatened him in the night.		
No more..The man had gotten explosives from his boat and blown up the tower..The enormous oneness of life on Mars, drawn together against the cruel environment, stirred in his blood..His legs wrapped around the man's waist and his hands got to work on the airhose..What a chase!		
"Now those old women on Earth want to give 'em the vote.".The round, hookbeaked heads, with huge amber eyes and tufted feather ears, showed the origin of the name "owlie.".The brush rustled dryly in alarm, tiny hidden animals squeaked their terror, the desert shouted to him of the monster that strode toward his cave..All this day they had been dogging him; he had never been more than half an hour ahead..It didn't matter, the owlie wouldn't escape.		
Presently he looked up, across a red and yellow immensity to the low sun..No rest, no rest, a devil's hunt through a tormented wilderness of stone and sand, and now he could only wait for the battle with an iron burden of exhaustion laid on him..With a howl of dismay, the hound slid down the sloping wall of the pit it had covered..They were the conquerors, and it never occurred to them that an ancient peace and stillness could be worth preserving..But somehow the incident brought home to him the immensity and the age and the loneliness of the desert.		
He had hoped the rockhound would go shooting past, but the animal braked itself barely in time..He grinned as he made camp..Kreega swung softly around..He wrapped one arm around a bush that clawed at his helmet and pulled the hound back..Through the darkness Kreega heard the man laughing.		
Primitive throb of drums in a hot wet night, chant of beaters dancing around a firescramble along the hellplains of Mercury with a swollen sun licking against his puny insulating suitthe grandeur and desolation of Neptune's liquidgas swamps and the huge blind thing that screamed and blundered after him But this was the loneliest and strangest and perhaps most dangerous hunt of all, and on that account the best..He itched intolerably, and his lungs were raw from gasping at his dole of air..The hawk swooped again and he lay unmoving, rigid as if dead, until it cried in shrill triumph and settled on his shoulder to pluck out his eyes..That was time enough, when the Martian was boxed in so small an area..Leaping, twisting, bounding from crag to crag, sliding down shaly ravines and slipping through clumps of trees, Kreega fled.		
"You're not falling into this owlieloving that's corrupted all Earth?".So it didn't matter..He had an airsuit designed for Martian conditions, with a small pump operated by a powerbeam from the boat to compress the atmosphere sufficiently for him to breathe it..He had lost axe and bow..But times are changing.		
*       *       *       *       * Riordan was tired with the long chase and the niggling insufficiency of his oxygen supply..He wanted to get the hunt over with..The Martian burst onto the edge of the cliff..The man got to one knee, sighting carefully on the gray form that streaked up the nearest slope..Dimly, he wondered if man would ever subdue Mars, if the human race had not finally run across something bigger than itself.		
Lonely or not, the man had a gun that could spang death clear to the horizon, and he had his beasts, and there would be a radio in the rocketboat for calling his fellows..Somewhat later, he heard a dull boom echoing between the hills..Kreega went down the cliff face, clawing into every tiny crevice, shuddering as the ageworn rock crumbled under his fingers.."Come on!".asked Wisby.		
He spread a map on the desk..No danger that the owlie would break in if he should double back; it would take tordenite to crack that hull..The chests were broad and deep, but the waists were ridiculously narrow..We may have to bombard.".To loose the thousand Earthly races and creeds and nationalisms on each otherand on the Galaxyto wallow in barbarism and slaughter and misery as before we came?		
"Why," I looked up at her, astonished, "even the psychologists" "They're limited, Con..We settled it behind a shed, with the workmen looking on, and I beat him unconscious as fast as possible.."The base here has chaplains..But from their point of view, they're slowly civilizing a race of atomicpowered savages, and taking no more than their just reward for it..Its people could live here almost indefinitely, working and waiting for their day of rising.		
We put restrictions on these colonials; they can't hold top jobs, and so on..At least there were no halfbreeds afterward..Like really to help the Legion of Freedom when they strike?".He was a nice kid..*       *       *       *       * She didn't know a great deal about the rebel movementno one agent on Earth didbut her knowledge was still considerable.		
The Empire just doesn't have enough men for a secret police, even if we wanted to indulge in that sort of historically ineffective control..Maybe that's why I'm afraid..I bided my time, not too obviously anxious to contact the Legion..There was tension in the shipif the Imperial navy should happen to spot us, we were done..Eb's horny palm clasped mine.		
VIII Barbara came in..Gods, I believed I was in the right, but why is right so pitiless?.Mike Riley said you'd be looking for me.".I told him that..And the operator wouldn't know who had attacked him.		
There aren't any Eridanians or Terries hereabouts, but we desperate characters" he grinned, briefly"can't be too careful..Very fine and idealistic, and no doubt fairly true as well.."But they've kept on conquering here and there, to this very day."."The best we could do at this point was to help elect someone from a minority subgroup of the dominant white race..I told them everything I knew.		
Somehow, they seem to think the Luronians may be guilty, but they aren't sure..Good old Luron, our archenemy, would see the light itself some day..Her voice was low and hurried, shaking just a little..We sent a coded call signal and got a directional beam from the ship.."I know.		
Stars glittered here and there in the dusky heavens, hard and bright and cruel, almost, as in space..Childish, melodramatic name!."But isn't there a lot of danger in the policy of fomenting rebellion against us?".Why, y'know, if 't hadn' been f' their laws I'd be skipper o' my own ship now..I did my best here too, whipping my grim young charges into a sapper group comparable to the Empire's, for I had to be above all suspicion, even of incompetence.		
Barbara was, of course, venomous about it..So men can talk between the stars, but are their words the wiser for that?.That was a good choice; no spaceship would ever happen into this system by accident or exploration..It's not their fault if the consent is forthcoming oftener than you idealists think.".Riley gave me a small card on which was written a name and address.		
Forget it.".But they seemed to have forgotten it now..I stood up..I was too tired.."Poor Con," she said.		
Otherwise get out.".The anarchs hoped to blast Valgolia to ruin in a few swift blows, and expected that the Empire's jealous neighbors would sweep in to complete the wreckage..Moodily, I began to see that I would be one of the pricepayers..But this group constituted no real threat..They were basically as decent and reasonable as any similar group of Valgolians.		
Riley puffed a cigaret for a while..The leader's name is Levinsohn..We need good men, and badly.".We checked up on you, Con, and we think you're as good a prospect as we ever came across.."Their first fifty years or so saw plenty of aggression.		
I knew with a dark chill that it would work..Technologies are entirely too similar.."That's for the future, though..I raised my eyebrows..I began to have a sneaking hope that the spaceship would be delayed.		
Yes, she could cook too..Yes, treating all Earthlings alike is the solution.."When do I start?"."Certainly they've made us economically dependent," I said, "and their standard of living is undoubtedly higher than ours..You're an American, Nat.		
All hands to battle stations!."Con, do you really mean all you've said about the Empire?".Barbara shuddered close to me as we came out of the airlock, and I put an arm about her waist, knowing the sudden feeling of loneliness which rose in her..Of course, these lads will be reconditioned to civilization when they finish their military service and prepare for more specialized work.."It can't," I said.		
"My work's developing some complications," I said tonelessly..But as the days went on, I saw less and less of it..For whatever I did would make little difference at this late date..It would tend to be passive whatever happened..I learned things which Intelligence had spent the last three years trying to find out, and dared not attempt to transmit the information.		
The rebels were counting on that fact to aid them when they struck, but it would, of course, work against them if their enemy should happen to hit first..But it was more than a change of attitude..Well, take her!.I needed an excuse for not going to the gun turret where I was assigned..It was like the sea wind which blew over the islands, and as reviving.		
The unit was set for the complicated secret scrambler pattern of the Legion, one which was changed periodically just in case..More of an atmosphere than a concrete thing.".Tears started forth in her eyes.."Holy smoking seegars," Blades whispered at last.."But in light of my responsibilities and under the provisions of the Constitution, I am hereby putting this asteroid under martial law.		
"Is that possible?"."Why, no.".If that thing goes off, the gamma burst will kick up so many minority carriers in the transistors that the ptype crystals will act ntype, and the ntype act ptype, for a whole couple of microseconds..It was astonishing how ignorant Earthsiders, even spacetraveling Earthsiders, often were about such matters..But I've already informed a number of my men.		
"You should have some idea, being in QM."."We'd have butted against your radar and bellied into your control tower."."Magnetic pulse, too," Chung said.."The leftenant?."We've been friends too long, Adam, for me to try bribing you.		
A lot of asterites would like to see more strictly homegrown enterprises, not committed to anyone on Earth..They're as mad as I am..They're waiting in the terminal.."But your own energy expenditure" Gilbertson objected..They're only using natural resources that rightly belong to the people, and the accumulated skills and wealth of an entire society."		
Why should they do anything to us?".She threw him a spray cartridge with a deft motion.."Entirely cryotronic, eh?".*       *       *       *       * "Pallas Castle calling NASS Altair..Can you swallow that story about a missile getting loose by accident?"		
Earthnormal weight dragged down every movement; the enclosed cabin began to feel suffocatingly small..Only three or four officers have been told..But never very long..Our bodies would, that is..Your TIMM systems can take that kind of a beating.		
I've never been more proud of being human.".Ellen straightened from the telescope..*       *       *       *       * A silence fell.."Have some," he invited.."Sure.		
If actual harm does occur, I'm sure the government will indemnify you..What was she to him?.Forget it.."Hoo hah, what lovely money that'd mean!"."It'd help a lot, but we can get along without if we have to, and personally, I prefer that.		
This secrecy is for your own protection.."What can she do?".Gilbertson challenged..A sort of Pauli exclusion principle..We'd get used to it again pretty quickly, Blades thought.		
I took her to your cabin and went back to help Jimmy..Well, that is, during the election campaign the Social Justice Party did talk a lot about oldline officers who were too hidebound to carry out modern policies effectively..I've got some news for you concerning that topsecret gadget you told us about.."After we've put you to so much trouble.".It didn't strike me as significant, though."		
On a metallic asteroid, you can find almost everything you want directly under your feet..Only the meteorite evasion units are operative right now.."We'd better continue the tour, if you please.".Blades spoke an obscenity.."What's the significance of this farce?"		
Chung barked..Hastily: "Do you use this machine often?".He took another sip as he hunted for suitable words.."Commander Leibknecht..He shook himself and protested: "Damnation, they're our own countrymen.		
Shouldn't I have?"."Don't tell me there's nothing about them in Leviticus, Padre!".He wondered why she hadn't taken advantage of the situation here to snaffle a husband.."Please explain yourself," he said without tone.."Nice name, that," mused Blades.		
Blades filed his misgivings for later reference..Blades didn't know whether he was being sarcastic or asking a genuine question..Avis cried.."And lovely bureaucrats crawling out of every file cabinet," Chung said grimly..Still She smiled back with the gentleness that he found disturbing when he noticed it.		
"You lousebitten, eggsucking, bloated faggotporter!."You must have trained in powered spacesuits at the Academy," he said for lack of a more poetic rejoinder.."Are you sure?".That is, the 'pilots will be turned on if you try to go beyond range of the beams now locked onto you..She stamped her foot.		
"But I think most of them will take the chance.."Who can be against social justice?.But it was several kilometers from the gas receptor end to the people end of the asteroid..Same effect, total computer amnesia.."O.K.," he wheezed.
