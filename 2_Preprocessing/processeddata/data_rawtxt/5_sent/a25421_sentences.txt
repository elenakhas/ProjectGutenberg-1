It saved my life..*       *       *       *       * Next morning, on the way to the electric train, Ernie made a purchase at the drugstore.."And cheer up, I say..Nevertheless there were times when he seriously wished he'd never acquired whatever power it wasexcept for Vivian, of course..His sister grabbed his arm.		
Then he saw he was parked in front of a demolished old apartment building a few blocks from his home..It became noticeable about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each sidean invisible slim vertical cylinder..Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't decided anyway who that would be)..Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an infinitypaneled adventurecomic of his life as he bolts his last rough ration of air..Flashing eyes."		
"I tell him he's attractive because he has Flashing Eyes and within two days he's wearing black glasses..Great relief..Afterward, Bert Willis used to say it was one of the most mystifying experiences of his life..There was nothing to see..I mean are they painful?"		
But my chief sources of information I am not permitted to disclose.).He moved stiffly toward the door..He didn't care who yelled at him or whom he bumped, so long as it didn't slow him down..Ernie jumped up and blurted out introductions..Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's surprise and embarrassment.		
Now, sober again, he had a clear confirmation of it when he left a banquet on a trumpedup excuse because of a disturbing vision of inexplicable rodlike shapesand read the next day that a hundred of the guests, of whom four finally died, had come down with bacterial food poisoning.."Who's been getting at you?".He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had ever really read the minddizzying lettering, ever really tested the stuffperhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's..He puts her on whenever he gets afraid he's getting attractive.".Mr. Jones brought him over half an hour ago and it's all arranged.		
No, thanks.".Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they should be..He thought of the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor..Ernie was one in a long series of such men..That circumstance seemed beyond imagination.		
For instance, that trick of having the images on the box fade back to the old ones.".He hadn't intended to wear them by day and hardly knew why he'd put them on before joining Vivian..He was pale..Ernie, they had to admit, was a remarkably wellpreserved old gent..And how?		
"No," she said, "I didn't," and she looked at him steadily, as she had that morning..He knew that the powder worked..I'm putting some eyedrops in them now.".Now he had used the tube to siphon out what he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!).He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.		
After dinner, he decided it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch..The people were just blurs anyway and soon he was beyond them.."Thuringer sausage at lunch.".Ironic, considering what a drunk he'd been and what strange junk he insisted on eating now.."Me attractive?		
Next moment he was in a small cab under which steel rails were vanishing at an alarming speed, and way ahead he could just make out the platform on which he was standing, and something was hurting his head and he was slumping forward and everything was darkening and the cab was leaping forward more swiftly still..However, they were grateful to the Cosmic AllFather..Add     water as needed..He turned it over several times..He was trying to be the same without much success.		
"This is where I get off."."Oh.".*       *       *       *       * He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat..Pretty soon the unbearable, edgeofdoom clarity in his mind faded, the universemacaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind individually, or at most in strings of three and four..Vivian accepted his seat with a certain deliberateness and with a smile that seemed to Ernie to say, "So I'm his morning lightbadinage girl, but this is the girl Mr. Meeker goes home with.		
For a good half a day, Ernie Meeker studied the rows of jars, canisters and glassstoppered bottles, sometimes lifting two down together and contemplating them, one in each hand, as if he could weigh the difference..I do hope you won't mind.".Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself, the first of the Big Gifts..In fact, he felt distinctly apathetic when his sister confronted him and only with an effort did he manage to brace himself for the trial he knew she had in store for him..*       *       *       *       * That evening marked the beginning of Ernie's serious drinking.		
But under the present circumstances, Ernie was confused.."In any case, don't get conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know how to take advantage of them.".Which, if it wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least darn comfortable..Ernie nodded..Ridiculous, of course.		
Things should behave as you expected them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the barely conscious level..It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring way..Gifts are upsetting..*       *       *       *       * Verna, on the other hand, had absolute confidence that she was sufficiently attractive for all practical purposes.."It's his life and he's doing what he thinks best."		
"Sometimes I think the tests are too fair," the Coadjutor observed..She nodded absently..That last picture was the most vivid, and when he realized he had actually stopped his car, it was a moment before it would go away..Could there be something wrong about the bathroom, something either in the room itself or in his childhood associations?.*       *       *       *       * As the Invisible Being had predicted, Ernie's first brush with the Great Gift gave him a considerable jolt, though he didn't suspect at first that it was a permanent gift.		
"Just that you put your hand up to them as if they hurt.".It was while you were out of the room..And yet he did no more bathroom testing..If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspiciouslooking man in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuelpowder company or of going to the F.B.I..Of course the car still ran.		
"In that case," Uncle Fabius opined, "you can be sure some fuelpowder swindler has been getting at him..Once, at a party, he bet twenty dollars that his eyes glowed in the dark..*       *       *       *       * Like many another carowning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city..The Butcher looked Brute squarely in the eyes..It's more than a matter of polarization.		
You underfives simply aren't allowed in the Time Theater..Perhaps, because of the intense darkness of the theater, you haven't realized how dimly lit the scene is.."Sic 'em, Darter!."Well, what if I will?"."I know," the Butcher said irritably.		
Hold still, Cynthia," a new voice cut in..But even he sounded a little solemn and subdued.."My father remembers when there wasn't a Time Theater," Hal said softly as he scanned the facade's glowing charts and maps..Joggy nodded..A sphincter dilated and they found themselves in a small transparent cubicle from which they could watch the show without disturbing the adult audience.		
How about it, Joggy?".Most of the light goes down the vistas visible to the other side of the audience.."But I don't feel any older," Joggy replied doubtfully..You quit that!".Unwillingly, eyes still fixed on the blackness ahead, Brute obeyed.		
The sorcerer appeared to be expostulating, commanding.."You tricked him into thinking you were older and his brain waves blanketed yours, going through the usher..A growl..There was a moment of rocking and pitching, during which each boy accused the other of trying to upset them.."I've heard an uninj is programmed with so many genuine canine reactions that it practically has racial memory."		
"I don't know, but it sounds great.".Then the warrior was standing outside the bubble, blinking toward the shadows, rain dripping from his beard and furs..the Butcher asked eagerly.."Yes, but suppose they did all the same.".The Butcher grimly slipped out the metal tube and put it to his lips.		
They have to be..In the cubicle, Hal and Joggy gasped, the two girls squeaked, but the Butcher yelled a "Hey!".Hal and Joggy switched off their levitators and dropped to their feet..But he didn't stay quiet.."Why?"		
A woman in a short golden tunic stood up uncertainly from the front row of the audience.."A viewing anomaly has occurred," the interpreter announced..The hooded figure is a most unusual find..Adults aren't conditioned to reject violent solutions to problems where nonhuman enemies are concerned..the Butcher countered hotly.		
"It doesn't matter what you think now," Hal said with finality.."While you're deciding, we'll get swimming..The Butcher hurled himself forward.."This is getting good," the Butcher said, squirming toward the edge of his seat..But it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot.		
There were two closely spaced faint plops and a large green stain appeared on the bare back of one girl, while purple fluid dripped from the closecropped hair of the other..We believe it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces of nature and see into the future.".The general sensation, however, was delightful and levitators were among the most prized of toys..Great brooding trees, the trunks of the nearer ones sliced by the bubble's surface, formed the background..True, by rocking the repulsor hemisphere backward, you could get a brief forward push, but it would be nullified when you rocked forward.		
Where's the bodies?".Even if the minority theory should prove trueand no evidence for it has ever appearedthere are automatically operating safeguards to protect the audience from any harmful consequences of time traveling (almost certainly impossible, remember) in either direction.".They glared at him and one of them said: "A cub!".Abrupt light flooded the Time Theater.."You think so now," Hal told him.		
"Oh, explanations!".Hal said, aghast..Brute sprang up after his master and was invisibly rebuffed.."I don't exactly know, but something.".murmured one of the newly arrived girls.		
"Hah!.There's a good reason for itsomething dangerous might happen if an underfive got inside.".Hal nudged Joggy and whispered: "Butch!"."Brute must have smelled 'em.".Want to walk us there, Butch?"		
And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.".When he was about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away..*       *       *       *       * It was really a more tiring method of transportation than walking and quite useless against the wind..*       *       *       *       * He kicked Brute in the face..The warriors who had emerged from the bubble stiffened themselves, baring their teeth.		
A redheaded adult heard and smiled and paused to watch.."He killed cities and piled the skulls..Joggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at shoulder height..the Butcher encouraged.."Butcher, that wasn't honest," Hal said a little worriedly.		
"They'll condition you out of the idea," Hal assured him.."The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric cultures of the Dawn Era," a soft voice explained, so casually that Joggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply, whispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: "Don't do that, Joggy.."Well, even if it is about Tamerlane, you can't see it.."Take it easy, Brute," the Butcher consoled him..Rising from a low central platform was a huge bubble of light, its lower surface somewhat flattened.		
"Say, they're viewing Earth, somewhere in Scandinavia around zero in the B.C.A.D. time scale..Only the hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder and fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant..He looked at Brute with guarded wistfulness.."Keep your seats!".Back and forth, lean, wolflike dogs paced with restless monotony.		
"Maybe he's getting racial memories from the Scands.".They were impatient and easily incapacitated by frustration.."Gods?"."That's queer.."If I am not mistaken, we have laid down similar caches."		
the Explorer exploded..They seem to have been obsessed by the notion that others, greater than themselves, had prospered before them and then died, leaving them to rebuild a civilization from ruins..Their appetites and emotions were not sufficiently subordinated to their understanding and to their sense of dramatheir enjoyment of the comedy and tragedy of existence..I couldn't wait to hear the details.".If I am to tell you everything you want to know, I must tell it my own way.		
You'd think we'd be turning up traces everywhere.".They seem to have been singularly guilty in their pleasures, behaving either like gloomy moralists or gluttons.."The first is the most obvious.."All in good time..The Explorer sounded anguished.		
"At any rate, when I heard that what we were looking for, you had found here at homeeven though dead and done forI felt that at least it was something..The present is always more important than the future.."As soon as our spaceship got within radio range of Earth, they started to send us a continuous newscast covering the period of our absence..They might have been birds, except they moved too slowly..Then the Explorer turned back.		
I suppose I set too much store by my hopes of establishing a contact.".Instead, I touch only corpses..The Explorer burst out, "I am not interested in all that dry stuff!."Yes, I guess you're right..Am I going to have to coax you?		
But that fourth answerit's morbid.".It captured my imagination..Our past is strewn with our dead.."Cute little brute, isn't it?"."Really, your absence from Earth has unsettled you even more than I first surmised.		
I grant the possibility of atomic power getting out of hand, though one would have thought they'd have taken the greatest precautions..I can understand that after your long absence from Earth, any news of Earth would seem especially important..*       *       *       *       * "They had spaceships?"."If these creatures were relatively advanced, why haven't we learned about them before?."It's barely possible.		
"I'm pleased that you should think of me and my work, and I'm very happy to see you again..He looked at the Explorer strangely..Their technology outstripped their psychology..Geologic ages of it..he remarked.		
"I have four answers to that," the Archeologist replied..*       *       *       *       * The Archeologist regarded him quizzically..What happiness they had, they had..One of the items, exasperatingly brief, mentioned your discovery..I mean, what if the creatures occupied a very different portion of the Earth than our own?		
"You old devil," he said in a manner that showed his gayer and more boisterous mood had returned, though diminished, "you still haven't told me anything definite about them.".What did they want?".It was probably created in a kind of exuberant fancifulness, with no serious belief that it would ever serve the purpose for which it was intended.".Again the slow shadows drifted overhead..Why not species?		
"I think I understand," the Archeologist said softly..He went on, "The cache was laid down when they were first attempting space flight, just after their discovery of atomic power, in the first flush of their youth.."So I haven't," replied the Archeologist with guileful innocence..The Archeologist gently waved aside the questions..What were they like?		
After a moment the Archeologist continued, "My reconstruction of their history, subsequent to the laying down of the cache, has been largely hypothetical..Somehow one thinks of an alien species as having just one language.".They skimped fatally when it came to hard thinking about the purpose of life and intellectual activity, and the means for preserving them.".Well, we found some planets with life upon them, all right.."What about what?"		
His expression showed only pleasure at being reunited with a longabsent friend..It's the find of the age!.His excitement had visibly evaporated, leaving behind a cold and miserable residue of feeling..Third, it's possible that atomic energy, out of control, finished the race and destroyed its traces..You shift in an instant from zenith to nadirand remember, out there you can see both.		
Still, it could happen..interrupted the Explorer..What did they create?."I am not sure I want to hear much more about them," he said..There is a kind of unraveling or erasing.		
These words and symbols seem to have come down unchanged from their most distant prehistory.".*       *       *       *       * The Explorer turned away..They set great store by personal prestige, by the amassing of wealth and the exercise of power..Supplementary material has been very slow in coming in, though we are still making extensive excavations at widely separated points..There's so little of it, and it's so lonely.		
Time..Machines are broken up and worked into primitive tools and weapons..But admit it now, isn't there something a bit odd about your getting so worked up over this thing?.And all the while there was wriggling toward them out of that future for which they yearned ... oh, it's so completely futile and unfair.".*       *       *       *       * Several small shadows crossed the windows overhead.
