"Oh, dear!"."Your strayman doin' anything these days?".About noon Leviatt and Tucson rode in to the Two Diamond corral gate, dismounted from their ponies, and proceeded to the bunkhouse for dinner..Ferguson laughed, and his sixshooter disappeared as mysteriously as it had appeared..Radford started, his face paling a little.		
It vindicated her judgment.."Of course."."Stafford hires a strayman," he said, sneering.."Why," she said, "I shouldn't think our running away would surprise you..The third man must have made a noise, for the captor turned sharply.		
Many times, when she had questioned him regarding the hero in her story, he had been on the point of taking her into his confidence as to the reason of his presence at the Two Diamond, but he had always put it off, hoping that things would be righted in the end and that he would be able to prove to her the honesty of his intentions.."You ain't missin' them none there.".Ferguson's lips whitened..Then suddenly above the good natured babble came a harsh word..As he rode out of the shadows of the trees within an eighth of a mile of her the sunlight shone fairly upon the pony.		
Then, with a final word to Tucson, he rose and strode carelessly to the door of Stafford's office..As he came out of a little gully a few miles up the river and rode along the crest of a ridge that rose above endless miles of plains, his thoughts went back to that first night in the bunkhouse when the outfit had come in from the range..At the end of an hour's work Ferguson bent over her with a question on his lips..Ferguson grinned and patted its flank with a remorseful hand.."Nor can I make a whole book out of only one character.		
Yet the news had shocked him; he could feel the blood surging rapidly through his veins..The first man's pistol had appeared just a fraction of a second sooner, and they saw that it was poised, menacing the rustler..He smiled slightly.."Yes.".Yet because of an order, issued by a girl, he was doomed to delay his appearance at the ranch.		
She laughed..Then she undressed him, and by the use of plenty of clear, cold water, a sponge, and some bandages, stopped the flow of blood in his shoulder and placed him in a comfortable position..Through rifts in the mountains descended the sun, spreading an effulgent expanse of yellow lightlike burnished gold.."You may have anticipated a meeting of those men, but you could not have foreseen the end.."Why, I don't know," she objected.		
She replied without looking at him..But whatever his game is, I ain't interferin'..The significance of this movement dawned upon Miss Radford in a flash, and she again seized Ferguson's arm, tugging at it fiercely..No man knew whence the word had come, but it was whispered that Rope Jones would be seen no more..The method by which they performed their ablutions was not delicate, but it was thorough.		
She looked from them to his face..he said finally..He was convinced that these men were migratory thieves, who operated upon the herds nearest them, remained until they had accumulated a considerable number of cattle, and then drove the entire lot to some favored friend who was not averse to running the risk of detection if through that risk he came into possession of easily earned money.."You're still thinkin' of puttin' me into the book?".Then he looked carefully at the strayman's waist for signs that a weapon might have been concealed between the waistband and the trousersin front.		
He looked gravely at her..You have fooled me as you have fooled everyone.".Twilight had suddenly come..But the hero would be the one character to whom she would devote the concentrated effort of her mind..Again his gaze swept the plains and the ridges about him.		
"Yes," she said looking steadily at him, "it does..You killed him to keep him from attacking other persons?".Ferguson preceded the young man at the tin wash basin, taking a fresh towel that the young woman offered him from the doorway..But I thought mebbe I'd been enough trouble already.".But in spite of her evident cheerfulness there was a suggestion of trouble swimming deep in her eyes; he could not help but see that she was making a brave attempt to hide her bitter disappointment over the turn things had taken.		
CHAPTER XIII "DO YOU SMOKE?".And then the scene had changed again, and he was shooting the head off a rattler.."I'm keepin' him for myself..This puncher was sitting in a chair; one foot was bandaged..A bullet hole in the cow's forehead told eloquently of the manner of her death.		
The result of the spring roundup had been far from satisfactory..He felt dimly that there was a chair under him, and he sank into it, leaning back and stretching himself out full length.."Do you mean that you wantin' to make sure that I loved you wasn't all for the sake of the story?".he questioned..But at the same time she knew that this society which she affected to despise would refuse to accept him; that if by any chance he should be given a place in it he would be an object of ridicule, or at the least passive contempt.		
He might have just stepped from one of her pages..Determined to investigate as far as possible, he rode down the river for a few miles, finally reaching a broad plain where the cattle were feeding..CHAPTER XVI LEVIATT TAKES A STEP Miss Radford was sitting on the flat rock on the hill where she had written the first page of her novel..For a long time he sat in the chair, looking out over a great stretch of flat country which was rimmed on three sides by a fringe of low hills, and behind him by the cottonwood.."A girl ain't doin' much stringin' when she's holdin' a man's hand an' blushin' when somebody ketches her at it."		
to his pony, but his eyes were not purposely bright and expectant as they tried to penetrate the semidarkness of the interior of the cabin for a glimpse of Miss Radford..Half a mile down the river she could see a corner of Ben's cabin, a section of the corral fence, and one of the small outbuildings.."I shot him, ma'am," he said gravely, "but he ain't goin' to die till sundown.".He had read several of these..she questioned, her eyes drooping away from his.		
"Well, now," he said, eyeing her, she thought, a bit reproachfully, "that comes pretty near stumpin' me..Mary Radford would never believe his protest that he had not been hired to kill her brother.."An' so Tucson's likin' you a heap," drawled Ferguson absently..He had seen no man about the cabin..She looked up quickly, surprised into meeting his gaze fairly.		
"I don't call it wastin' time to be talkin' to you," he declared rapidly..The number of cattle missing tallied exactly with the number he had seen in the basin down the river..The habits of the prairiedog were not alone betrayed to the ears of the young lady..Then anyone could see us..Mebbe I won't shoot him.		
I am sorry that I ever met you.."Of course it all seems commonplace to you," she returned; "perhaps even monotonous..His sudden appearance gave her something of a shock, for as he stood there, smiling at her, he answered perfectly the description she had just written..When had this thing started?.A sudden whim to discover if he recognized her, took possession of herfor she had known him long and he had been a friend to her father when friends were few; she stood looking straight at him.		
When he saw the door of his room begin to swing slowly back, he got up, his face grave, ready to deliver his resignation in person..It was not Randerson, however, but Vickers, who was coming..There was that in her tone which told him that he might now make his case strongmight even convince her, and thus be restored to that grace from which he, plainly, had fallen.."I'm glad of that, ma'am."."You ain't tellin' her!"		
"I reckon.".she exclaimed..Seating herself on a flat rock near the canyon edge, she settled herself to wait..Ruth had been worried more than she would have been willing to admit, over the presence of Chavis and his two men in the vicinity, and that morning after she had questioned a puncher about the former Flying W foreman, she had determined to ride down the river for the purpose of making a long distance observation of the "shack" the puncher and Randerson had mentioned as being inhabited by Chavis..she asked challengingly.		
But she did not invite him to alight..They tried to dissuade him, for they did not know his thoughts, and perhaps would not have given him credit for them if they had..And when it was over, Randerson took the saddle and bridle off Patches, turned him loose in the corral and returned to the porch to talk and smoke with Uncle Jepson.."Oh!".For an instant there was no movement in the vast realm of space except the terrific thunder of Patches' hoofs as they spurned the hard alkali level over which he was running; the squeaking protests of the saddle leather, and Randerson's low voice as he coaxed the pony to greater speed.		
He seemed annoyed, but spoke persuasively.."You an' dad was a heap mistaken, then," he grinned as he dismounted and trailed the reins over the pony's head..And it must be after midnight, now!"."If I should complain to the sheriff?".That makes them see things where there ain't anything to see.		
Jealous, mebbeeh?".Seven men, besides the cookasleep under the wagonand Randerson, were lying around the fire in positions similar to his own.."He used to kiss me..She had seen Pickett's movement when Randerson had momentarily turned his back to him, but she had also seen Randerson's retaliatory movement.."Whywhy," hesitated Ruth, "the thing that makes you yourselfapart from every other person; your reputation; the good that is in youthe good you feel."		
Randerson leaped..At a safe distance, the other men followedRuth saw Masten and Chavis come out of the bunkhouse door and follow also.."But that buzzard up there will be pullin' his freightif he's got any sense.".But its glitter at his side was met by the roar and flame spurt of Randerson's heavy six, the thumb snap on the hammer telling of the lack of a trigger spring, the position of the weapon indicating that it had not been drawn from its holster.."Your selfcontrol does you credit, Mr.		
"She's killed him, but she'll die amournin' over it!"."Why, I've been wonderin'" and he grinned guiltily "whether it'd be exactly proper..He cast a glance around him.."That's the way, ma'am.".It was over in an instant, though every detail was vividly impressed upon the girl's mind.		
"You might have shown him in some other way that you liked him," she said with unsmiling sarcasm..He was conserving the pony's strength..He did care, after all, enough to part with his companionsfor her sake..You expected he would try to shoot you, and you deliberately gave him an opportunity, relying upon your quickness in getting your own pistol out.".She told herself it was not pleasurebut she saw his eyes flash.		
CHAPTER XI                               HAGAR'S EYES Randerson had been in no hurry to make an attempt to catch the rustlers whose depredations he had reported to Ruth..Pickett said he wanted to 'git' you, an' that Masten wanted to get you out of the way because of what you'd done to him at Calamity..*       *       *       *       * Shortly after Abe Catherson's departure from the cabin, Ruth came to the door and looked out..Blair, especially, had taken a fancy to him, and therefore it was not many days after the shooting of Kelso that Uncle Jepson got the story, with all its gruesome details, from his lips..ejaculated the girl.		
"But you don't like him, do you?".Well, mebbe Masten" He paused and licked his lips.."He's foreman now, isn't he?".Outside, in the brilliant sunshine, a sense of time, place, and events came back to her, and for the first time since her recovery she thought of Abe Catherson's note, which Hagar had read.."I reckon she'd have wanted it different," he said to himself.		
But instantly she felt its forelegs stiffen, felt it slide; the thought came to her that it must have slid on a flat rock or a treacherous stretch of lava.."I wouldn't say that it would be a good thing everywhere..But now she saw that his eyes were blazing with an insane frenzy, that his lips were working, and that the muscles of his neck stood out like great cords, strained to the bursting point.."Only I was hoping it would be Randerson, my dear," said Aunt Martha gently..he said with a laugh, low and derisive.		
Nor did they see Ruth after they arrived, for she had gone to bed.."Why, sure, ma'am.".For during the exchange of amenities Randerson had answered himwithout turning, though: "What you wantin', Red?"."Why, I reckon not," she answered hesitatingly, "that is, not cryin' regular..She wondered what she would do were Hagar her daughter, and for an instant she was drunken with the intensity of the passion that gripped her.		
Not as a tiger would fight, but as Randerson himself had foughtnot with a lust to do murder, but in selfprotection..Her face reddened a little too, for now she realized that he had held her hand for quite a while, and she had made no motion to withdraw it..I was in Utah, once, lookin' over the Mormons..They traveled the trail that Randerson had taken on the night he had found Ruth on the rock; they negotiated the plain that spread between the ranchhouse and the ford where Randerson had just missed meeting Ruth that day; they went steadily over the hilly country and passed through the section of broken land where Ruth's pony had thrown her..Randerson, the one exception, was seated on the edge of the chuck box, its canvas cover pushed aside, one leg dangling, his elbow resting on the other.		
But after he had lain there a while, he spoke aloud: "He'll come this way, if he comes at all.".She did not open her lips until Uncle Jepson had concluded, and then she murmured a low "Oh!".When he recovered he drew back out of sight, and leaning against the wall of the cabin, with a pencil and a small piece of paper taken from a note book in a pocket, he wrote..She was over her scare now, he knewas he was over his fears for her, and he grinned with a humor brought on by a revulsion of feeling..And his voice sounded insincere to herthere was even no flavor of shame in them: "I'm sorry I done what I did, ma'am."		
He turned his head from her and smiled, toward the stable, and then he laid a hand on Ruth's shoulder and spoke comfortingly..He had gazed downward, and he did not look up at once..And again Uncle Jepson had trouble with his pipe.."I ain't been thinkin' of the killin' of Pickett as murder, ma'am.."Women is mighty uncertain critters, ain't they, Ma?"		
Oh Nig, Nig, what am I goin' to do now?".Out at the edge of the porch, Hagar shot a dreading glance around..He grinned at Randerson suspiciously..It was hideousthe dread, the uncertainty, the terrible suspense, the dragging minutes.."I'm waitin' for you to tell Masten that you don't want to manage him."		
CHAPTER XXV                            A MAN IS BORN AGAIN The meeting between Catherson and Randerson had taken the edge off Catherson's frenzy, but it had not shaken his determination..This was her father's voice..But, of course, if you don't want me" "It ain't that," he interrupted quickly..In a strip of shade under the eaves of the station sat the station agent, gazing drowsily from under the wide brim of his hat at the two glistening lines of steel that stretched into the interminable distance..It would not fade.		
Sheila felt herself swaying and tried to grasp the end of the seat to steady herself..Dakota's lips curled a little..Assuredly you would not allow Dakota to go unpunished?"."Don't you see?"."You've said something.		
He tapped his gun holster significantly..Blanca had run his iron on them an' sold them to Dakota for Star stock..And I told the parson to get out of the country, so he wouldn't do any gassing about it.."Please don't bother," she said.."Yes," returned Dakota, a slow, grimly humorous smile reaching his face, "it was a mistake.		
Moulin looked searchingly at Dakota, saw that he was in earnest, and suddenly reached a hand over the bar.."Meaning that I'm afraid of him, I reckon?".One morning, however, she rode up to the door of the cabin and Doubler's face was serious.."I have not forgotten it..That's why I rode over hereto see if you'd got it.		
Five years ago, after the spring roundup, I branded a bunch of calves with a secret mark, and then we rode sign on Blanca..Maybe he'll be proving that he didn't mean to skin me on that deal.".She quickly grew to like Doubler..Her father was there, she observed, as she drew nearer; and three strangersand Allen!.He smiled significantly at Sheila, and an odd expression came into her face, for she remembered that on the night of her coming he had made the same remark.		
"I wouldn't think of allowing one of the men to take the pony back..Two weeks had passed since Duncan had told her of his suspicions, and they had been two weeks of constant worry and dread to her..The sarcasm in this last brought a dark red into Duncan's face, but he successfully concealed his resentment and smiled.."She told you, then?".I expect he's been fillin' your dad up."		
You can get some fresh after a while..Dusk had come; above her countless stars flickered in the deep blue of the sky.."Still, you couldn't expect to look dignified, no matter how hard you tried, after being dragged through the water like that..He jerked his thumb in the direction of the river trail, on which Dakota had vanished some time before.."But those that you have seen?"		
His manner, too, was ingratiating; he smiled too much to suit her; his presumption of proprietorship over her irritated her not a little..Then, after receiving from him some sign which would convince her, she would take her belongings and depart for the East, leaving him to his own devices..But, thank God, my dear, I have not that crime to answer for..Dakota's laugh when he returned the knife to the box chilled Sheila as that same laugh had chilled her when she had heard it during her first night in the countryin this same cabin, with Dakota sitting at the tablea bitter, mocking laugh that had in it a savagery controlled by an iron will.."Meaning?"		
Sheila's defense of Dakota seemed to indicate that a certain intimacy existed between them..I am going to himto stay with him until the doctor arrives..Instantly he stepped inside the cabin door, reappearing immediately, holding a rifle..She supposed that he had grown tired of the unceasing bustle and activity of city life, as had she, and longed for something different, and she had been quite as eager as he to take up her residence here.."MyMr. Langford," returned Sheila.		
Told folks he didn't have any desire to send the gambler over the divide; just wanted to show him that when he was playin' with fire he ought to be careful.."Now, you don't look dignified, for a fact," he grinned, brazenly allowing his mirth to show in his eyes and in the sudden, curved lines that had come around his mouth..On the morning of the fifth day after his adventure with Doubler he was sitting on the ranchhouse gallery with Duncan, enjoying an afterbreakfast cigar, when he said casually to the latter: "I take it that folks in this country are mighty careless with their weapons.".There was a small clearing therea clearing in a dense wood beside a riverthe same river which she could have seen below her now, had she looked.."I didn't know you were so bloodthirsty as that," he laughed in quiet mockery.		
"And I suppose you have a corner on all the knowledge of ranch life," suggested Sheila sarcastically..I sent him for you..You're in something of a hurry, it seems."."I know what Duncan's friendship amounts to," he said harshly..The day before she had spoken to Langford concerning the continued presence of Duncan on their rides, and he had laughed at her, assuring her that Duncan was not a "bad fellow," and though she had not taken issue with him on this point she had decided that hereafter, in self protection, she would discontinue her rides with her father as long as he was accompanied by the former owner.		
"Yes..Nor was she surprised to discover that he had dropped pretense altogetherhe was bound to do that sooner or later.."So he wasn't a rustler, after all?".While Sheila watched the man's lips opened; she could hear the words that came through themshe would never forget them: "To have and to hold from this day forth ... till death do you part...." It was not a dream, it was the picture of an actual occurrence..She took a step toward the door, but halted before reaching it, turning to look back at him.		
Equivocation would have taken him safely away from the pitfall into which his rash words had almost plunged him, but he felt that any evasion now would only bring scorn into the eyes which he wished to see alight with something else..Once over the crossing and on the river trail where the riding was better, she held the pony to an even, steady pace..But it's a fact, just the same..It might be restored, patched so that it would resemble its original shape, but never again would it appear the same in her eyes..For some minutes she sat motionless in the saddle, stunned and nerveless.		
"You are mistaken.".She must be brave now, for there might still be life in Doubler's body, and she went slowly toward him, cringing and shrinking, along the wall of the cabin.."A month."."There ought to be a good many ways of making it plain to Doubler that he isn't wanted in this section of the country," he insinuated.."I don't see why father should want your land," Sheila told him gravely, much disturbed at this unexpected development.		
"Meanin' that Langford's been to see Dakota?".I've seen Dakota throw down on a man so quick that it would make you dizzy.".That is what has happened here..Why didn't you let him die?.Dakota only made him feel cheap.		
They can't do anything until Doubler dies."."Well, it isn't so bad, after all..For the trail to the river, which she had decided she would follow, led through a fertile country where the bunch grass grew long and green, the barren stretches of alkali were infrequent, and where the low wooded hills and the shallow gullies seemed to hint at the mystery..She regarded him with a sudden, new interest..Taken altogether, it seemed that Duncan's present suspicions were the result of his dislike, or fear, of Dakota.
