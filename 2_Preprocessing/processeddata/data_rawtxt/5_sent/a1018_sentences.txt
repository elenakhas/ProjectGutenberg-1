He won’t discover us, though, for we have the wind towards us.” The mustang broke into a trot, running to the right, then to the left, and finally turned and disappeared as we had seen him come..The head engineer found himself in an awkward predicament..Cut their bonds,” he said..I must have a tenderfoot to abuse; whom shall I scold if you are gone?” Some other tenderfoot.” That’s easier said than done, for I’ll never have another outandout hopeless greenhorn such as you are in all my life..We were awakened chilled to our marrows.		
But I felt I ought to give Stone and Parker a chance to withdraw if they chose, and asked them if they wanted to take a hand in the game..Sam cried out to me in anguish: If you could see your face and hear the mournful tone of your voice!.We knew that fifty Apaches were close to us, yet that we must not betray our knowledge by the slightest sign..And the pain in my shoulder was not caused by a millwheel crushing me, but by the blow which Winnetou had given me..No matter how fast I swam, or what curves I made, the chief’s tomahawk was sure to overtake me.		
I should have taken this; I’d have shown him that Sam Hawkins can go through the water like a trout..Through the warpaint on his face we saw pass over it varying expressions of anger, hatred, and malice..It looked from where the Indians stood as though I had killed him, and again I heard that awful howl..get to the cedar, quick!” shouted Sam Hawkins..I rose and they tied my hands together.		
Braves, let us laugh at him.” He looked around invitingly, but no one laughed, and he said: You are afraid of him, but I will show you how I mock him..But I felt sure that in this case it was only because the chief and Winnetou were too heavily encumbered by the corpse of KlekiPetrah, and in too great haste to avenge his murder, to obliterate the trace of their course, and rode on with no fear of an ambush..The Great Spirit gives him into my hand by taking away his senses.” Among Indians this sort of preliminary fight with tongues is customary, and I should have been considered cowardly if I had stood silent, so I answered: You fight with the mouth, but I have here a knife; take your place if you are not afraid.” He bounded into the other circle, crying angrily: Afraid!.The grizzly..If I speak later, you will see that Old Shatterhand is not a man whose word is to be despised.” IntschuTschuna turned from us, and nodded to certain old warriors, who left the circle and gathered around him for consultation, while Tangua of course used every effort to turn the decision as he wished.		
On the day of my death.” You have said it..I hastened to see if Sam was hurt, and found him standing, much shaken, but not otherwise the worse..They’ll all be here shortly..My fair young nurse dipped the cloth in the water and bathed the face and hands of the supposed enemy of her father and brother..Of course he perceived this, and I feared he would make a movement which would betray me, but he was much too wise and had too much presence of mind for that.		
He has only made statements, but has not proved them..It may be imagined how excited they were at this announcement; Sam, Dick, and Will more than I..For I, the former blasphemer, now seek to find His will in all things..I doubt your being a thief or a murderer.” I laughed as I spoke, but he said gravely: Thank you, but you are mistaken..It’s better a hopeless greenhorn should die than a valuable, experienced scout.		
Our companions slept, our fire had burned low, and all the Kiowas’ fires were out but one..They must wipe out this stain by fighting him..An angry dilation of his pupil warned me, and the next moment his right arm struck quickly and forcibly upward to rip my body like an old coat..Would you like to see the envelope?” asked Sam, dismounting..I caught his right hand, and squeezed it till he dropped the knife; then I seized his left arm at the elbow and pulled him over till he had to let go of my throat.		
I have spoken..Though his eyes might once have been piercing, angry, threatening, now they were as calm and clear as a forest lake..I can’t look on at this..Winnetou rode all night to this point; do you see that the trail goes on from here in single file?.The fire was getting low, and I thought there was no use in putting off the evil hour, so I yawned, stretched myself, and said: I’m tired, and I’d like to go to sleep; how about you, Sam?” I’ve no objection,” he said.		
When we take the skin off we can see what killed him..Don’t bother yourself with the affairs of others..They stood shouting and questioning on the bank, while the chief still swam back and forth waiting for me, although I could not possibly have remained so long under water..Sam scanned the sky, and then said: Apparently we are going to have rain today, and that happens rarely about here, but is the very best thing for our plan.” Why?” I asked..The guns lay at some distance back of us towards the peninsula, ready to be seized by us later in our flight.		
What torture is intended for him?” Everything possible..We had not gone far from camp, and had lain down under a tree, where I could study his face and expression at leisure..Though they were curious, none asked further questions, for, like the beast he had captured, when Sam wouldn’t he wouldn’t, and that was the end of it..How should I manage?.We’d better go on a few steps and be first, or some Kiowa will get ahead of us.		
Disregarding all my signals to him, Sam had taken the Indians to our men, who were in a high state of delight when they learned they had come in friendship and there was no longer any reason for our fearing the Apaches..It was otherwise with me..The trail was easily followed, a fact which made Sam doubt its being trustworthy; for he said that when an Indian left his course so easily traced by an enemy the chance was it was done only to lead that enemy into a trap..Then—” This miserable coyote lies as if he had a hundred tongues,” cried Tangua..I had sprung at him as soon as I saw his intention, but too late.		
Where is my mule?” he cried..Old Shatterhand must shoot first.” No,” I said..When I came to myself it was evening; so long had I lain unconscious..Then the Apaches will come—and find no one!.When you went into that circle my heart stood still; I could not breathe, and my thoughts were full of how I’d carry out this tenderfoot’s last will and testament.		
To have proof that it was really I who had freed him..The hearts of the warriors of the glorious tribe of the Kiowas are brave and wise..He seemed to be, as I afterwards learned he was, of the same age as myself, and his appearance made as profound an impression on me then, when I saw him first, as his character has left upon me today, after our long friendship..You’ve got to eat your words.” I felt that I must punish this Indian, not merely for justice’ sake and the effect on the Apaches, but for the benefit of those white men whom he might meet in the future..A WISH AND ITS TRAGIC FULFILMENT. YOU do not speak like a Westerner,” said KlekiPetrah as we started.		
Now: One, two—” He held the knife tight, and I should have shot him, not in the head, but in the hand, for he had to learn to respect me; but luckily I did not get so far, for at this moment a loud voice cried: Men, are you mad?.The room was bare, but NschoTschi furnished it quickly with skins, covers, and ornaments, so that I felt at home at once..Before I put a hand down I first felt the spot to make sure there were no twigs that would crackle under the weight of my body and thus betray me; and if I had to go under or between branches I tested them carefully to make sure that I could get through..Therefore the white men of the West call him Old Shatterhand.” Thus without any choice of mine I was given the name which has ever since clung to me..I know nothing of the art of mustangcatching, of which you are past master, and I’ve nothing to do but follow your directions.” All right.		
My young white brother has such courage.” My son speaks truly,” added the father in as perfect English..Think of him often; it will be good for you..It came from Winnetou..How!” These wishes were not very practical, but they seemed to please the Indians as much as if they were already fulfilled..When I saw his face I thought it would go hard with IntschuTschuna and Winnetou if they fell into his hands.		
I heard a splash behind me: IntschuTschuna had jumped in..This is the custom of the West..How admirable had been his conduct and that of his father!.If a man doesn’t intend making a fight, then what on earth does he shoot for?.Shall Old Shatterhand, who can become the greatest and most renowned warrior of the Apaches, be driven away from us today because our braves despise him?” It was hard for me to answer; my heart bade me press my request, my commonsense forbade it.		
And the second time he had to defend himself from you..And then think of the consequences of such a fight..Had it not been taken from me?.He walked to the window, gazed outside and reconciled himself to what would come: "There lies the road to Bab en Nebi Daud, and that way goes to Bab el Amud..With the victory never tipping to their side, the Hebronite musicians had no chance to play their instruments.		
His words resounded..Jew Eppstein kept on joking: "Well, would that be really bad for me?".You promised me!".Now, may I leave you again?.We were served excellent Hebron wine, a bottle of which cost one franc.		
Bewildered, Mustafa pressed further: "Art?.Disappointedly, the man asked: "Isn't that too few?".What I have on now is not bold enough..The Pasha now drew closer to Mustafa and asked: "Who are you?.In a flash, the face of the Pasha became serious again, almost threatening: "No speech of yours can gain the boy's pardon.		
We were given a beautiful, cool, domed room that had two broadly curved arches..My brother had simply disappeared..To make up for lost time, the horses fell into a trot..Here is the money that I borrowed..You were supposed to come tomorrow.		
"You guessed correctly..Yet the sin does not stem from the price that he demands..At the height of four meters, this tree begins to fork and to form immense boughs..Should I contact a reliable rentadonkey business for the trip you're planning?".One of her sunburned, delicate hands held a few longstemmed Canterburybell flowers.		
At this point, our festive procession would begin to movehalf of us ahead and half trailing..Something inside him stopped..Abd en Nom's house was located near the site of Lazarus' Grave..In spite of this threat, the boy had to laugh as he answered:  "No thoughts?.In a softer and more confidential tone, he officially put forth this question: "Yesterday evening, did you also think that I would receive a good thrashing?		
I have always said this, so I'll continue to repeat it: If the faith of these people were pure and noble, then they would not find it necessary to keep others away from their shrines.".In light of the tragically comical, apprehensive demeanor of mules, it really was impossible to keep a straight face..Just think!.At this point, he handed her the cane, stepped back, and beckoned her to proceed..The Pasha asked who she was.		
The boy spoke up: "I've changed my mind; there will be more than two..Isn't that laughable?"."We should leave quickly.".I asked how much it cost for the fifteen cups of coffee..The trader picked it up and showed it to us.		
He answered promptly:  "I'm Judas Maccabees, and I have a vendetta against the Syrians..Who's right?.We were happy to oblige: "If it's OK with you, we have no objection to Thar coming with us.".There's something very necessary that I must do..I placed my hand on his shirt collar and brought him into the adjoining room: "I believe it's best that Schamah and her mother don't know that you and the Donkey Driver secretly instigated this part of their visit to Jerusalem.		
Understand that my Coffee Helper Bem and my darkskinned cook are a married couple.."Yes, Thar!.He happily called out: "So, if you'll permit me, I'll accompany you..With a kind of superior look, his eyes glided over us: "All of you simply stand and marvel!.As for the rest, I had to do this by myself; she has no talent to do more."		
As we came still closer to the garden house, we heard Thar's angry voice as he shouted to his father: "No!.Add to this a second, almost equally deep sorrow and innersoul excitement which we were yet to discover..Effendi, please tell me what I said.".She wanted to take a few pictures at the Pool of Siloam and a couple of photos in Bethany.."I still have something to tell you; today is Friday, a holiday.		
"You don't like that?".His two sons were there, both of whom we recognized from Thar's description of them: "the largest Whale that we have and the strongest Hippo that ever was.".In his psyche, he himself was used to doing a lot of soulsearching..Her voice sounded soft and tender, yet strikingly moving..Don't you see the Red Sea that is right in front of you?		
As you know, I'm a hero..We are true, absolute, and obedient believers of the Prophet..She and her young daughter were on a pilgrimage to the holy cities of Bethlehem and Jerusalem..So Jacob erected a memorial upon her grave;  to this day, Rachel's monument is still there.".Of course, she followed him.		
I couldn't tolerate that sort of contempt, because such insolence involved behavior that I wanted to bypass and avoid completely..His laughter was so contagious that we could not help but join him..I demand that he be punished!".Thar vaulted onto the back of Guewerdschina and said: "I'm riding with you..Regarding the local hatred of Christians which every German assumes to be the case, he very weakly subscribed to that prejudice.		
He levies a tax on whomever he wants..Later on, no one could find out where he went..He began to read the following lines: "You are all Canaanites: Hittites, Jebusites , Girgashites, Hivites, people of Arka, Amorites, Sidonians, Phenicians, those from Zemar, Arvadians, Hamathians, and all others dwelling in Zidon..Laughingly, he closed the matter with words about his darling Trickster's capers: "He was his mother's 'chosen one.'.Where then?"		
With this last sum, he closed his hand and made a movement as if he wanted to pocket the money..Quite softly, faintly, gently like the sound is falling from heaven..Mustafa Bustani pleaded his case: "According to Islam, hospitality belongs to those who are virtuous, and no one is released from this obligation.".When Schamah's mother heard all of this, her fear reached its peak..For a moment, he reflected, then bowed to her and replied that he would grant her requestbut not before the count of ten which he had dictated.		
Incredulous, the father inquired further: "How so?.They go by these names: Hittites, Jebusites, Girgashites, Hivites, people of Arka, Amorites, Sidonians, Phenicians, those in Zemar, Arvadians, Hamathians, and all others dwelling in Zidon..Since he comes from Germany, he speaks German exceptionally well.."Well now, where did you find all of the heroes?".Every other creature, whether man or beast, risked destruction.		
From the inner pocket of his vest, he took out a small notebook and gave it to me..I did not see them;  I only saw the dark, mocking, main character from the swamp which was my home town and the trashy novels from Hohenstein;  but they persistently talked to me;  they influenced me..[a] Spanish for "holy brotherhood", an alliance of Spanish cities     with their own jurisdiction and policeforce..What pleasure this was!.For America he was supposed to be called Old Shatterhand, but for the orient he was to bear the name Kara Ben Nemsi [a], because I took for granted that he would have to be a German.		
At this time, I had already been writing for Pustet in Regensburg for several years, who published my "traveller's tales" in his magazine "Deutscher Hausschatz".."Quite easily", I answered..On every page, something happened, something most interesting, some great, hard, daring deed, which was to be admired..I had described Münchmeyer thus vividly to her, that she could picture him quite correctly, though she had not seen him yet..She quickly pulled the door shut behind herself and said excitedly, but quietly: "For God's sake!		
And when I resisted, they grew louder, to cloud my senses and to tire me, so that I lost the strength to resist..I replied to him that I was not at home and that I therefore was unable to invite him..There, every frog was individually taken from the basket, lovingly petted, and put into the water..In our penitentiaries, conditions are not less moral and not less humane than in freedom..Heyse was     outraged and harshly rejected this offer.		
But the contents was eagerly devoured by the readers, again and again, and I have to admit to the truth and confess to my own disgrace that I also, once I had tasted it, totally succumbed to the devil, who was hiding in those volumes..figuratively or symbolically..My novels would now be his property..He distributed this all over the place, to "destroy" me according to the Münchmeyers' method..But I had been committed with nothing less than good attestations of character, could not possible escape the future police supervision, and had not found any time yet to show that I nevertheless deserved their trust.		
Here, the voices kept silent;  this calmed me down..I only remember that I lived in a cell for six weeks, together with two other men..Of course, it had been impossible for me to publish them right away, since those written for Pustet had to come out first..A literary theft, plagiarism this is, is only committed when essential components of another author's mental creation are copied and then used in a manner which makes them an essential component of the plagiarist's work and thereby the impression is created that they were his own thoughts..I thought of last night, my thoughts before falling asleep, and now all of a sudden there was dismissal and imprisonment!		
I was not supposed to be able to prove the changes!.This was a hard time, a time of suffering, for all of us..So I had to be economical, thinking twice before I would spend a single pfennig!.For every flaw, which could be found, a certain amount was subtracted from the wages..In the meantime, the attacks in the press against me had been getting more and more numerous and direct.		
What he is given, can turn out to be his blessing or his misfortune, can enrich his knowledge or worsen his punishment, can lead him towards understanding himself and the errors of his ways, but it can also offend and harden him..I was accused of having written piously and indecently at the same time..I have respected Heinrich Keiter, as everyone respected him..There was a nightwatchman, but the inhabitants had to take turns in participating in the nightly watch..In the background, towering high above it, rose above anything else what had become my ideal since that night when I had seen the Faust:  to write plays for the theatre!		
This number 48 was published on Christmas Eve..Though he wished that, by no means, I should allow this to disturb me in my work, he could not keep me from being the master of my apartment, and then, when this had become impossible to me, I did not hesitate to give the apartment up and to move away from Blasewitz, to the city..I was of the opinion that a man with honour could not proceed after such a silence, especially since I had totallyrejectedLebiusconcerningthebooklet. But on August the 8th, he nevertheless wrote again: "On the 4th of this month, I have become the sole proprietor of the "Sachsenstimme" at favourable conditions..That Peter Rosegger, the distinguished, sensitive, and humanely thinking aristocrat of the mind, regards what he has mentioned concerning my youth as finished and done away with, goes without saying..The fairytale and I, we are being read by thousands, without being understood, because the depth is not explored.		
Where this journey took me and what happened on it, shall be reported in the second volume..But once the admission is made, honestly and according to the truth, that my "traveller's tales" have not been written for the young generation, the foundation of the nowadays commonplace supposition that they were harmful has been removed..There, they were singing..Grandmother could not give him anything..I consider it necessary to state here that I did not regard my condition as pathological at all.		
I did not put the watch back into my pocket, but into my suit, where it did not belong to, and as soon as this had happened, the gendarme returned to get me..When my lawyer informed me of this threat, it all became so very clear to me;  I started to comprehend and felt obliged to probe this terrain..It was a joy to see how excellently this was developing..But I did not sleep tight;  I kept on waking up..And high above us was the salvation, was the noble state of the human soul, we had to aspire up to.		
Particular attention was devoted on me..What for?.I confess that by this promise he had already won me over more than half of the way..She did not want to answer;  but I asked her, until she did..Whether novelists and artists would accept me as a "colleague", I had to ignore then.		
But what this meant in practice, I could see all around me in a truthfulness, which was just as plain as it was disturbing..New rumours circulated with romantic embellishments..The concepts and views of the law change;  the lie turns into the truth, the truth, into the lie..The ancestors had tested these effects and had added very many marginal notes to the volume, telling about the results of these tests..They screamed and cheered and mocked, so that my ears were ringing.		
It was regarded as the only relief from worry, and its worst effects were accepted, as if this was the most natural thing in the world..There are hostile people who have said that I had only sought contact with this Catholic publisher for the sake of money..But all of my conceptions of art were something entirely different than this what today's critics describe as art; and thus I was left with no other choice than to postpone all of my wishes, which concerned me being allowed to be an artist in literature, an artist who is a true, valuable artist, for many, many long years and to remain until then what I was at the time, a beginner, who is not a part of the established business, and who made no pretension to becoming a member of it..Maeterlinck     nevertheless used Heyse's ideas, but in a manner which did not     constitute plagiarism and openly pointed this out in an     appendix to the German edition of his play..I could not find any thoughts.		
Near the end, the reproach got milder, and in the end, he cheerfully extended to me, the ignorant boy, his hand and told me that he would not be too excessively appalled, if, after four or five years had passed, another one of my Indian stories should end up on his desk..Their contents had constituted such strong evidence in a lawsuit against Münchmeyer that I simply had to win it.."Dead    deceased!".He figured out that with six to seven thousand subscribers, he would break even;  everything beyond this was profit..This would have given me enough space and time for what I intended.		
He attended all markets, all inns and bars in order to buy or to find buyers..This enraged him..Destiny seemed to agree with my intentions..I only knew that the rumour was about those novels I had written for Münchmeyer, but I found no one who would have been able to name the chapters and the passages to me where this indecency would be contained..You can easily imagine that there was no school and no work on that day.		
When I wanted to work by day, I could not achieve anything..I liked this even more..If he sues us, we will destroy him by publishing his  | | prior convictions in all newspapers throughout Germany..The sisters also had other interests..This is just as selfevident as it is correct.
