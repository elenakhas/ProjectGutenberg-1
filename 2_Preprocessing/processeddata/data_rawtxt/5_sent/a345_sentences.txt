I have seen the eyes of young Arabs of the street grow brighter as you approached and say, 'That's my lady, she comes to see my mam when she's sick.'."Oh nothing much, only my cousin Belle has been here this morning, and she has been putting me on the stool of repentance."."Why you see that boy's parents are very rich, and in course of time he will be one of my customers.".He says all he wants me to do, is to get well, and take care of the home and children.."Yes, but her father never forgave her.		
I have learned to live without love."."Why he's from England, and is said to be the only son and heir of a very rich nobleman."."Suppose now, we go to the tailor's and get some new rigging?".He accepted it, but we parted as friends.."He is in society, caressed and [ ed?]		
"Who is that gentleman?.Did Joe go in with you, and where is he now?".You know his grandfather has left him a large estate out West, which is constantly increasing in value..I have often heard her say that she lived by faith and not sight, that poverty had its compensations, that there was something very sweet in a life of simple trust, to her, God was not some far off and unapproachable force in the universe, the unconscious Creator of all consciousness, the unperceiving author of all perception, but a Friend and a Father coming near to her in sorrows, taking cognizance of her grief, and gently smoothing her path in life.."But mother, I do think it would be a dreadful thing for women to vote Oh!		
Religion somehow got associated in my mind with sorrow and death, but it seems to me since I have known you and Mr. Clifford the thing looks different..we will go his security, he is a fine fellow and we hate to see him go under.".But it was too late, the shadows that never deceive flitted over the pale beauty of the marble brow, the waxen lid closed over the once bright and laughing eye, and the cold grave for its rest had won the child.."Yes!."Fix this so," said Joe to the barber, giving him directions how to cut his mustache.		
Your profit will be the loss of others..They were playing with the firebrands of death and thought they were Romancandles and harmless rockets..An unspoken prophecy to be verified by bitter tears, and lonely fear that seemed for a moment to turn life's sweetness into bitterness and gall.."I recognized you as soon as you moved into the neighborhood.".said a full manly voice.		
You are one of my best customers, did liquor ever harm you?"."Can't afford it!."Died of starvation!.Oh!.replied Mary Gladstone, "don't see what's to hinder her from being happy.		
"It certainly is.".He looked at the clock, it was just fifteen minutes to three..You seem suddenly to have lost all patience with Charlie.".I sent for you as soon as I could rouse the servants.".I meet her occasionally.		
Still I am very glad if I have been of any service, and you are perfectly welcome to make demands upon me that will add to Mrs..And you know that you and Miss Roland are to be married in two weeks, and I do wish that things might remain as they are, at least till after the wedding.."And what then?"."It is and I hope," but as the words rose to his lips, he looked into the face of Belle, and it was so radiant with intelligent tenderness and joy, that she seemed to him almost like a glorified saint, a being too precious high and good for common household uses, and so the remainder of the sentence died upon his lips and he held his peace..Clifford."		
"Very well, I expect to be there and will look for you.."I can't afford it," said John Anderson, to his wife who had been asking for money for a trip to a fashionable watering place.."Oh!.Can you do anything for him?.and there was a tone of wonder in the voice, and a puzzled look on the face of Paul Clifford.		
"And a very disagreeable knack it is.".I am going to open a first class saloon, and clubhouse, on M. Street, and if you will join with me we can make a splendid thing of it.."I can't help it, if he persists in his downward course he must take the consequences..These were dark days but we managed to live through them.."They shall be ready by tomorrow."		
Faith took the place of doubting, and in the precious promises of the Bible she felt that her soul had found a safe and sure anchorage..About twelve years since when I had just commenced business, I lent him five hundred dollars, and when his business troubles became complicated I refused to foreclose a mortgage which I had on his home..He held in his hand a pair of shears, and approached my bedside..After Mr. Romaine had left the room, Charles sat, burying his head in his hands and indulging bitter thoughts toward his father..Chapter VIII Paul Clifford sat at his ledger with a perplexed and anxious look.		
Oh mother, I never want to see the day when women vote.".Not Charles Romaine with the blurred and bloated countenance, the staggering gait, the confused and vacant eye; but Charles Romaine as a young, handsome and talented lawyer, the pride of our village, the hope of his father and the joy of his mother; before whom the future was opening full of rich and rare promises..Just then the door was opened, and Joe Gough entered, or rather all that remained of the once witty, talented and handsome Josiah Gough..I don't blame him, I rather admire his spirit of selfreliance, and I wouldn't lay the weight of my smallest finger upon his selfrespect to repress it; still I would like to see your Mamy, and Hatty, have a chance to get out into the woods, and have what I call a good time..If I knew that Mr. Glossop was sorry for having been a liquor dealer and was bringing forth fruits meet for repentance, I would be among the first to hail his reformation with heartfelt satisfaction; but when I hear that while he no longer sells liquor, that he constantly offers it to his guests, I feel that he should rather sit down in sackcloth and ashes than fireside at sumptuous feasts, obtained by liquor selling.		
As you open the parlor door your feet sink in the rich and beautiful carpet..Just as his life was trembling on its frailest chords, and its delicate machinery almost wound up, Charles Romaine returned, sober enough to take in the situation..She had learned to "look up and not to look down."."She will never be like any one else..I talked to him, his mother pled with him, but it was no use, liquor was his master, and when he couldn't get liquor I've known him to break into his pantry to get our burning fluid to assuage his thirst.		
I watched Joe's face, it seemed lit up with earnestness and hope, as if that man had brought him a message of deliverance; then after the meeting came the signing of the pledge and joining the reform club, and it would have done you good to see the men that joined.".Oh who will justify the ways of God to man?."James" she said calmly and sadly, "I am very sorry to see you so ready to use what is not your own..Gough."."Yes Jeanette we will meet in less than twenty years, but before then your glad light eyes will be dim with tears, and the easy path you have striven to walk will be thickly strewn with thorn; and whether you deserve it or not, life will have for you a mournful earnestness, but notwithstanding all your frivolity and flippancy there is fine gold in your character, which the fire of affliction only will reveal."		
"Yes, but as we could not agree on the total abstinence question, we parted company."."If he should not return while I am here will you invite him to attend?."Yes.".And he spared neither pains nor expense to make his saloon attractive to what he called, "the young bloods of the city," and by these he meant young men whose parents were wealthy, and whose sons had more leisure and spending money than was good for them..I don't know," said Jeanette her face crimsoning beneath the doctor's searching glance.		
Like many other women in her condition of life, she had been brought up in entire ignorance of managing any other business, than that which belonged to her household..I got it associated with something else besides the pall, the hearse, and weeping mourners.."It was so sudden, I was not prepared for it."."I thought so too, but it is said that she refused him, but I don't believe it; I don't believe that she had a chance.".I mean a love which is mine, as anything else on earth is mine, a love precious, enduring and strong, which brings hope and joy and sunshine over one's path in life.		
No poor person who asked her for bread ever went away empty.."Yes, poor fellow, and I think if any man ever inherited drunkenness, he did, for his father and his mother were drunkards before him.".who is he?."Not at all..Lacking social influence and social adaptation, she had been ignored in society, her faults of temper made prominent her most promising traits of character left unnoticed, but this treatment was not without some benefit to Annette.		
After that they came down to the desk where I was casting up my accounts and Mr. Mahler asked, 'Is Mrs. Cooper your mother?'."I certainly will if he will give me any chance to get my living and help my mother."."I will not say what hinders, but I will say what I think you can try to do to help..I sat down trembling with emotion..That being finished the merchant for whom he had done the work, hired him to labor in his warehouse.		
"Who else is coming, grandma?".Annette was seated next to several girls who laughed and chatted incessantly with each other without deigning to notice her..He had mingled with many people and had acquired a large store of information..Of course I would not deny my mother..At length, her uncle Thomas decided that she should go with him.		
He has been a curse, and his saloon a nuisance in that street..Friends feared that Lucy was losing her mind and might do some desperate deed, but she did not.."Poor child," Mrs. Lasette replied; "I am sorry for her.."Mrs..After the funeral, Mrs. Harcourt's children returned to the house where they quietly but earnestly discussed the question what shall be done with Annette.		
When he was down they were ready to kick him down.."Put yourself then in my place..Mrs. Lasette was a fine conversationalist..That girl is going to give her grandmother a great deal of trouble.".I have been blessed with privileges which were denied others; I sat 'mid the light of knowledge when some of my illfated sisters did not know what it was to see daylight in their cabins from one week's end to the other.		
Mr. Thomas told him how he learned to be a carpenter in the South and how he had tried so unsuccessfully in the North to get an opportunity to work at his trade until discouraged with the attempt, he had made up his mind to take whatever work came to hand till he could see farther..Women who tried to teach their sons to be worthy of the love and esteem of good women by being as chaste in their conversation and as pure in their lives as their young daughters who sat at their side sheltered in their pleasant and peaceful homes.."Annette," said Mrs. Lasette, "is a favorite of mine; I have always a warm place in my heart for her, and I really want to see the child do well.."I do wish, Brother Lomax, those costly buildings which you erect will cover more needs and wants of our people than some of them do now.".If she was poor and respectable we valued her for what she was rather than for what she possessed.		
Chapter XIX And thus they parted..I have a little leisure I can give you.."What's the use of it?.Mr. Hazleton seemed to be perfectly satisfied with you, and I thought that you were quite a favorite in the establishment..I have not spoken of it to you before, but today, when it pressed so painfully upon my mind, it was a relief to me to tell you about it, but now darling dismiss it from your mind and let the dead past bury its dead."		
"Well, for my part, I hope it will be a match.".I answered, 'yes sir.'.Grandmother Harcourt looked the very impersonation of satisfaction as she gathered up the floral gifts, and modestly waited while Annette received the pleasant compliments of admiring friends..Eager and earnest for the elevation of the colored people, he has been pained at the coldness with which they have been received..Men grew thoughtful and attentive, women tender and sympathetic as they heard this member of a once despised people, recount the trials and triumphs of her race, and the hopes that gathered around their future.		
Mrs. Lasette, who happened in the house the evening before the entertainment, asked, "Is not Annette going?".If I were like you I would be all the time keeping this neighborhood in hot water."."But maybe the good husband won't turn up for Annette.".The builder bit his lip; he had come to America hearing that it was a land of liberty but he had found an undreamed of tyranny which had entered his workshop and controlled his choice of workmen, and as much as he deprecated the injustice, it was the dictum of a vitiated public opinion that his field of occupation should be closed against the Negro, and he felt that he was forced, either to give up his business or submit to the decree.."How that child grows," said Mrs. Larkins, as Annette entered the room.		
Rest and careful nursing soon wrought a wondrous change in Marie Luzerne, but Annette thoughtfully refrained from all reference to her past history and waited for time to unravel the mystery she could not understand, and with this unsolved mystery the match between her and Luzerne was broken off..All her other children had married and left her, and in her lowly home this young child with infantile sweetness, beguiled many a lonely hour..Without being forced to look to his mother for assistance, while the confidence of his community was slowly growing, he depended on the school for his living and looked to the future for his success as a physician.."Clarence," said Mr. Thomas to his friend, noticing the deep interest he was manifesting, "Are you entranced?.I had lived most of my life in a small inland town, where people were old fashioned enough to believe in honor and upright conduct, and from what I had heard of Frank Miller I was led to despise his vices and detest his character, and yet here were women whom I believed to be good and virtuous, smiling in his face, and graciously receiving his attentions.		
asked the astounded Englishman.."Do you mean by that that things are always going to remain as they are?"."Taking this view of the matter I see the pertinence of your position on this subject..After supper Annette's uncle went out and her aunt sat quietly and sewed till bed time, and then showed Annette to her room and left the lonely girl to herself and her great sorrow..You are so good and gentle."		
"She wants kissing.".Poor child, how wretched she was till "peace bound up her bleeding heart," and even then the arrow had pierced too deep for healing..To her, Annette was a new charge, an increased burden; but burden to be defended by her love and guarded by her care..The merchant, vexed at the unnecessary delay, said to Mr. Thomas in a bantering manner, "I believe you can do almost anything, couldn't you make this counter?".She had become so absorbed in herself that she forgot everybody else and thought more of her rights than her duties.		
Do you think because Miss Joseph is white that she is any better than you are.".He had seen many things in the life of the people with whom he was identified which gave him intense pain, but instead of constantly censuring and finding fault with their inconsistencies of conscience, he strove to live so blamelessly before them that he would show them by example a more excellent way and "criticise by creation.".The court in which Mrs. Harcourt lived was not a very desirable place, but, on account of her color, eligible houses could not always be obtained, and however decent, quiet or respectable she might appear on applying for a house, she was often met with the rebuff, "We don't rent to colored people," and men who virtually assigned her race the lowest place and humblest positions could talk so glibly of the degradation of the Negro while by their Christless and inhuman prejudice they were helping add to their low social condition..He had left A.P.."No prejudice against color!"		
I wouldn't tell it out of our ranks, but I don't think she wrote that all herself."."Nothing at all; I never had an unpleasant word with him in my life."."No; I am not rich, but I hope that I will always be able to lend a hand to any lonely girl who is neglected, slighted and forgotten while she is trying to do right, who comes within my reach while I live in A.P..Just now some of us are interested in getting our people out of these wretched alleys and crowded tenement houses into the larger, freer air of the country..He was willing to give Mr. Thomas work, and put tools in his hands, and while watching how deftly he handled them, he did not notice the indignant scowls on the faces of his workmen, and their murmurs of disapprobation as they uttered their dissatisfaction one to the other.		
"I do not think that I fully comprehend you," Mr. Lomax replied..How so?."You went to the wrong one when you went to your aunt 'Liza.."Who do you think wrote it for her?".And now while the guests are quietly taking their seats let me introduce you to them.		
But while she was strong and healthy her husband, whose health was not very firm, soon succumbed to the change of climate and new modes of living and left Mrs. Harcourt a stranger and widow in a strange land with six children dependent on her for bread and shelter: but during her short sojourn in the North[3] she had enlisted the sympathy and respect of kind friends, who came to her relief and helped her to help herself, the very best assistance they could bestow upon her..His wife could earn $1.50 a day, and instead of moving on his land, he remained about forty miles away, till he had forfeited his claim, and it fell into the hands of the present proprietor..But when I spoke to Mrs. Larkins about her, she said Annette makes a fine appearance, but all is not gold that glitters.."Yes, I know what she wants; but what do you think she wants?".They were not considerate enough to take into account her antenatal history, and to pity where they were so ready to condemn.		
"Oh, I hope he will come, he's so nice.".For her in that mission there was no room..Little children either shrank from her or grew quiet in her presence.."No; we won't work for a man who employs a nigger.".Everything seems to be against me."		
"And who made you?".The son of a dear friend had said to his mother, "I know I shall be killed, but I go to free the slave.".She said she came in yesterday with the Union soldiers, and that she had come from Louisiana, and then Minnie told her to come with her, and she would find a place for her to stop.".When I joined her, I found a colored woman talking to her, and she was trembling from head to foot, and just as pale as a ghost; and I said, 'Why, Minnie, what is the matter?'".Shall I?"		
And she felt on reading it with tearful eyes, that if she belonged to that race they had not shamed her by their want of courage; and so when Louis came to her and told her his intention, she would not attempt to oppose him, and when he was ready to depart, with many prayers, and sad farewells, she gave him up to fight the battles of freedom, for such it was to him, who went with every nerve in his right arm tingling to strike a blow for liberty..He felt as a mariner at midnight on a moonless sea, who suddenly, when the storm is brewing, finds that he has lost his compass and his chart..A skilful nurse, she knew how to prepare the most delicate viands to tempt the failing appetite, and she had the exquisite pleasure of seeing her care and attention rewarded by the returning health and strength of her child.."Why, Minnie, you are not going to walk down the street with that Nigcolored woman; if you are, please excuse me.."Tell them to come into the parlor, they are wanted immediately."		
We are determined to tolerate no scalawags, nor carpetbaggers among us.."Yes, she did, but she will never do it again," exclaimed Mrs..Georgiette has taken a dislike to the child, and there is no living in peace with her unless I sell the child or take it away.".Why some of our nabobs would give three thousand dollars; but I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll let you have her for two thousand dollars; fancy article is cheap at that.".I believe it is the only thing that I have any talent for."		
But we must not forget that Minnie will soon be a young lady; that she is very beautiful, and even now she begins to attract admiration..Come home as soon as you can.".Why she jist up wid her foot and kicked Nancy in de mouf, and knocked out two of her teef.."Yes."."I know that there are those that have great obstacles to overcome, but I think that while Southerners may have more personal likings for certain favorite servants, they have stronger prejudices than even we have, or if they have no more than we have, they have more selfrestraint, and show it more virulently."		
He had plenty of money, a liberal education, and could have chosen a life of ease, but he was too ardent in his temperament, too decided in his character, not to feel an interest in the great events which were then transpiring in the country..And so nothing daunted by difficulties and dangers, he set out on his journey, and being aided by rebels on his way in a few weeks he reached the old plantation on Red River; he found his sister and Miriam there both glad to see him..You are as pale as death, and trembling like a leaf,tell me if there is any truth in these words," turning and fixing his eyes on Miriam, who stood like some ancient prophetess, her lips pronouncing some fearful doom, while she watched in breathless anguish the effect upon the fated victim..The first of the speakers is the son of Josiah Collins, and his friend is Louis Le Croix, Camilla's adopted brother..As she went slowly on, loitering for her friend, she saw a woman approaching her from the opposite side of the street.		
I'd send you both, Ellen, but, to tell you the truth, the plantation is running down, and the crops are so short this year I can't afford it; but when times get better, I'll send you up there and tell you where you can find her.".His mother said she had dedicated him to the Blessed Virgin, and I reckon she wanted to keep him out of the way of temptation.."Sit down," said Minnie to the stranger, handing her a chair, "and wait till father comes.".Their hearts were too full; and as Minnie left the room, Thomas said, "Not now, Anna..I believe the time will come, when he will see it in its true light, and if he joins our ranks he will be an important accession to our cause.		
"But my wife is along.".Minnie came forward and gave her hand to Miriam, as Louis said, "This is my grandmother.".They have been careful to instil into her young mind a reverence for humanity, and to recognize beneath all externals, whether of condition or color, the human soul all written over with the handmarks of divinity and the common claims of humanity.."Oh, never fear, thee's among friends; thee need not be afraid to tell all about thyself.".Chapter XIV Where was he steering; and now, the course of his life was changed, what kind of future must he make for himself?		
A deceitful thing to try to pass for white when she is colored!.And with these words the two friends parted to meet again the next day at the railroad station.."You look so much like a picture I have seen of yours in your father's album..But there the similitude ends; unlike Le Croix, he had grown up a gay and reckless young man, fond of sports, and living an aimless life..And what do you think Minnie said?"		
said Georgiette in a sharp, shrill tone.."We are going to open a school, and devote our lives to the upbuilding of the future race..Louis turned pale, but bracing his nerves he said, "Where are they?".But the question of the intermingling of the races in marriage is one that scarcely interests this question..Miriam did as she was bidden; but her heart was lighter when she knew that freedom had come so near her and Louis.		
cried a half dozen voices.."Come, go home with me.".However, her brave young heart never failed her, but kept true to its purpose to join that noble band who left the sunshine of their homes to help build up a new South on the basis of a higher and better civilization..Minnie trembled from head to foot; a deadly pallor overspread her cheek, and she stood still as if rooted to the ground in silent amazement, while the woman stood anxiously watching her as if her future were hanging on the decision of her lips.."Well, perhaps she has, but, darling, you cannot better the condition of the colored men without helping the colored women.		
She had seen the old system under a new light.."Yes, but I have not told you the crowning attraction.".Le Grange bit his lip, but said nothing..And then she made us feel so indignant when she told us that on her way to Washington to get her son's pension, she stopped in Philadelphia, and the conductor tried to make her leave the car, and because she would not, he ran the car off the track."."Well, let me begin: she has the most beautiful little feet.		
There is only one subject which is to them a source of concern..There's nothing like having faith."."Here's my wife," said Louis, turning to Minnie.."Saratoga?"."I will, darling," he said, kissing her tenderly again and again.		
Milly, in spite of her indignation could not help laughing..Oh, how I should hate to be colored!"."Yes," said Miriam, "but not so bad as to see him fighting agin his own color..Prejudiced as we are in Pennsylvania, we do not go that far."."She asked her where she came from, and where she lived.		
said two of her schoolmates, who observed that Carrie had come home alone..said Minnie, to her adopted father..Camilla following, wondering how she would like the young wife..Chapter XVI "And I," said Minnie, "will help you pay it.".said a pale and interestinglooking girl.		
Where's your hat and mantle?"."She is well, and often wonders what has become of her poor boy; but she always has persisted in believing that she would see you again, and I know her dear old eyes will run over with gladness..Has thee ever examined it?".A friend of mine, who was an angel of mercy to the Union prisoners, dressing their wounds and carrying them relief, had a dear son, who always kept a Union flag at home, which he regarded with almost religious devotion.."She passed on, and left me talking with Mrs. Jackson.		
Louis bowed very low, and expressed his pleasure in seeing them; and hoped they would have a happy time, and that nothing should be wanting on his part, to make it so.."Come in," said Thomas, as he reached his door, "come in, thee's welcome to stop and rest with us.".Not that they love her less on account of the blood that is in her veins, but they dread the effect its discovery would have upon the pleasant social circle with which she is surrounded, and also the fear that the revelation would be painful to her..She had to go; but he was glad of one thing; the trader was dead, and his wife had got a place in the city with a very nice lady, and he hoped to see her when he went to New Orleans..He arose like one in a dream, walked slowly to the door and left the room.
