IV..No beast, no bird hath here his home;   The bees borne on the breezy air   Pass high above those fragrant bells   To other flowers, to other dells..I've heard of fearful winds and darkness that come there,   The little brooks, that seem all pastime and all play,   When they are angry, roar like lions for their prey..Let thy wheelbarrow alone..Written in GERMANY,   On one of the coldest days of the Century.

But in the branches of the Oak   Two Ravens now began to croak   Their nuptial song, a gladsome air;   And to her own green bower the breeze   That instant brought two stripling Bees   To feed and murmur there..Thou Eglantine whose arch so proudly towers   (Even like a rainbow spanning half the vale)   Thou one fair shrub, oh!.Green pastures she views in the midst of the dale,   Down which she so often has tripp'd with her pail,   And a single small cottage, a nest like a Jove's,   The only one dwelling on earth that she loves..he lifted up his eyes,   And looking round he thought that he perceiv'd   Strange alteration wrought on every side   Among the woods and fields, and that the rocks,   And the eternal hills, themselves were chang'd..But who is He with modest looks,   And clad in homely russet brown?		
MICHAEL,   A PASTORAL POEM   If from the public way you turn your steps   Up the tumultuous brook of Greenhead Gill,   You will suppose that with an upright path   Your feet must struggle; in such bold ascent   The pastoral Mountains front you, face to face..When in the snow the Mother spied   The print of Lucy's feet..It chanc'd that Andrew pass'd that way   Just at the time; and there he found   The Cripple in the midday heat   Standing alone, and at his feet   He saw the penny on the ground..[Footnote 3: The great Gavel, so called I imagine, from its resemblance to the Gable end of a house, is one of the highest of the Cumberland mountains.."From me this friendly warning take"   The Broom began to doze,   And thus to keep herself awake   Did gently interpose.		
The bason of boxwood, [9] just six months before,   Had stood on the table at Timothy's door,   A Coffin through Timothy's threshold had pass'd,   One Child did it bear and that Child was his last..Scarce a funeral   Comes to this churchyard once, in eighteen months;   And yet, some changes must take place among you..On silence Matthew lay, and eyed   The spring beneath the tree;   And thus the dear old Man replied,   The greyhair'd Man of glee..Such was his first resolve; he thought again,   And his heart fail'd him..Let him be free of mountain solitudes,   And have around him, whether heard or nor,   The pleasant melody of woodland birds.
