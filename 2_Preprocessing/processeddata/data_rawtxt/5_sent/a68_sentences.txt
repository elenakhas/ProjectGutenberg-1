The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.."Not at all..As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress..He was a heavy young man, with not more than common sense; but as there was nothing disagreeable in his figure or address, the young lady was well pleased with her conquest..And, bytheby, you had better not invite her any more on that account, as I wish her to find her situation as unpleasant as possible.		
"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be very frequent..On Thursday we have Company at home..Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughterinlaw in the prospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure..I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what.".Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come?		
In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed "It is he; it is indeedI know it is!".As Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour..It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.."I am sure I shall break mine," said Lydia..I have not thought well of him from the time of the play.		
She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life which humanity required..You must have seen the difference as well as I..Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax..If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor dishonesty I must call it.".Mr.		
"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but at Hartfield.".always my kindest friend on every occasion..How did you all behave?.But as soon as I once found myself safely arrived in the inside of this tremendous building, I comforted myself with the hope of having my spirits revived, by the sight of two beautifull girls, such as the Miss Lesleys had been represented to me, at Edinburgh.."He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he was lightheaded at the time.		
"Oh!.Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place..It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days..She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged..It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc.		
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information..If a part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making anything of it..But though the conference had seemed full long to him, and though on looking at Fanny he saw rather a flush of vexation, he inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listened to without some profit to the speaker..She is gone out of harbour already; three days before we had any thought of it; and I do not know what I am to do about Sam's things, they will never be ready in time; for she may have her orders tomorrow, perhaps.."Ah!		
Sir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her evasions, disarmed by her flattery; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction that where the present pleasure of those she loved was at stake, her kindness did sometimes overpower her judgment..Understanding and gratification came together..I could have no right.".Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner..Yes, only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regardhad he even confused her by his too significant reference!		
Miss Tilney drew back directly, and the heavy doors were closed upon the mortified Catherine, who, having seen, in a momentary glance beyond them, a narrower passage, more numerous openings, and symptoms of a winding staircase, believed herself at last within the reach of something worth her notice; and felt, as she unwillingly paced back the gallery, that she would rather be allowed to examine that end of the house than see all the finery of all the rest..She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy..Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings, as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.."She is walking, I believe.".She is going to London to see her particular friend, Mrs. Johnson.		
She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her.."Depend upon mebut ask no more questions..Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's..Henry Crawford gone, she could even pity her sister..At the same time, do not forget my real interest; say all that you can to convince him that I shall be quite wretched if he remains here; you know my reasonspropriety, and so forth.		
"Ah!.Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days..We must not allow her to accept the part..Do not you?."Neither Madam; he was a Wine Merchant."		
'The consequence,' said she, 'has been a state of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought..Catherine, delighted by all that had passed, proceeded gaily to Pulteney Street, walking, as she concluded, with great elasticity, though she had never thought of it before..But I have not the least inclination to go near her..Does he want a horse?.Darcy?"		
Have all her friends left her?".Sir Thomas paused, half smiled, glanced at his niece, and then gravely replied, "She will never leave us, I hope, till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here.".there I amthinking of him directly..That tall, proud man.".A glimpse, as she passed through the hall, of the two ladies walking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat, and she worked and meditated in the East room, undisturbed, for a quarter of an hour, when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance of Miss Crawford.		
"Come," said she, "I will tell you something, in return for what you have told me.."I shall not ride tomorrow, certainly," said Fanny; "I have been out very often lately, and would rather stay at home.."Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be rational again.".'Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune.'.She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.		
His presence was beginning to be odious to her; and if Maria gained him not, she was now cool enough to dispense with any other revenge..Don't scruple.."Do come with me," said Mrs. Weston, "if it be not very disagreeable to you..They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could, and now, to complete the business, are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us..Mr. Johnson and he are the greatest friends in the world.		
Oh!.Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful..They really go on Monday; and I was within a trifle of being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day!.Her introductions and recommendations must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of..Mrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten.		
What say you all?."My love, have you been asleep?".Henry, who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me, confides in me, and will talk to me by the hour together, has never yet turned the page in a letter; and very often it is nothing more than'Dear Mary, I am just arrived.."Poor young man!and what is to become of him?".He saw her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect.		
Domestic happiness is out of the question.."I do not know what I told her," he replied, impatiently; "less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future..Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her..Their being her relations too made it so much the worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put up with one another..Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in orders already."		
"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)a conversation between us one evening at Barton Parkit was the evening of a dancein which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some measure, your sister Marianne.".Mary always has her own way.".continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, "I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.".But they are Lady Middleton's visitors.."Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well," replied Mrs. Palmer;"Not that I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town.		
Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise..But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all.".They met for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards, or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy..Did not I do right?And I suppose you had no great difficultyYou did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal?".here comes your beau, Nancy,' my cousin said t'other day, when she saw him crossing the street to the house.		
Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all over the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them, where there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the trees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest, hadassisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockingsgiven Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.."Yes," he replied gravely, "once I have..And the dried cherries too!.CHAPTER 25 Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not without a settled habitation of her own..Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.		
Marianne, I dare say, will not leave her room again this evening..To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins' situations in the most delicate particulars,and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.."These are done by my eldest sister," said he; "and you, as a man of taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them..I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred ayear, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better..In such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty, of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude, she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary rambles.		
cried Elinor; "have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door?.and, in some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him.".Know your own happiness..Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again" Elinor stopped him with a reproof..Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire lately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr. Ferrars, and the kind confidante of himself, talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies, and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.His behaviour to her in this, as well as in every other particular, his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days, his readiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion, might very well justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment, and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the first, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it herself.		
In Bond Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all that interested and occupied the others..Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen him there..I only stood at the door, and heard what I could..Come, come, this won't do, Colonel; so let us hear the truth of it.".You tell me that she has forgiven me already.		
Elinor, I am miserable, indeed," before her voice was entirely lost in sobs..She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her..Her husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her objection..yes, that I do indeed..Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, "And have you really, Ma'am, talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?		
"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you," said she; "What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mama?."You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character farther..A short, a very short time however must now decide what Willoughby's intentions were; in all probability he was already in town..By whom can he have been instigated?".I never wish to offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.		
I am sure they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair.".Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?."Oh, yes, I dare say you will.".Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account; her daughters might do as they pleased..Ferrars."		
You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before, it is quite charming!.CHAPTER 14 The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance.."I can believe it," said Elinor; "but unfortunately he did not feel the same.".Astonished and shocked at so unloverlike a speech, she was almost ready to cry out, "Lord!.said Sir John.		
"Well, Marianne," said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, "for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well..From Cleveland, which was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not beyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at home in little more than three weeks' time.."And what," said Mrs. Dashwood, "is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest?.It will be all to one a better match for your sister.."You are mistaken, Elinor," said she warmly, "in supposing I know very little of Willoughby.		
He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think, Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life.".He then took leave of the whole party..Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell me, what is the matter?"."Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait.."If you would but let us know what your business is," said Mrs. Jennings, "we might see whether it could be put off or not."		
"Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do."."I had not thought of that..To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother..Willoughby opened the pianoforte, and asked Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground..At length Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh, "I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement.		
"Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the deviation is necessary.."Fifty thousand pounds, my dear..Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and wellbred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their parties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.."Is that Fanny's hair?.They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be.		
But that was not enough; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them..cried Margaret, "how happy I should be!.Mama saw him here once before;but I was with my uncle at Weymouth..This has always been your doctrine, I am sure.".said his wife, laughing.		
She hesitated; she knew not what to do..I was mistaken, it is true, but I believed myself right.".In his last letter he actually gave me some particulars of her behaviour at Langford, such as he received from a gentleman who knew her perfectly well, which, if true, must raise abhorrence against her, and which Reginald himself was entirely disposed to credit..Why do you require particulars?.My removal, therefore, which must, at any rate, take place soon, may, with perfect convenience, be hastened; and I make it my particular request that I may not in any way be instrumental in separating a family so affectionately attached to each other.		
"Oh!".I am persuaded the gout is brought on or kept off at pleasure; it was the same when I wanted to join the Hamiltons to the Lakes; and three years ago, when I had a fancy for Bath, nothing could induce him to have a gouty symptom..XVI LADY SUSAN TO MRS. JOHNSON Churchhill..Lady Susan finds it necessary that Frederica should be to blame, and probably has sometimes judged it expedient to excuse her of illnature and sometimes to lament her want of sense..Leave Frederica, therefore, to punish herself for the plague she has given you, by indulging that romantic tenderheartedness which will always ensure her misery enough, and come to London as soon as you can.		
Poor Reginald was beyond measure concerned to see his fair friend in such distress, and watched her with so much tender solicitude, that I, who occasionally caught her observing his countenance with exultation, was quite out of patience..I am pleased to find that my letter had so much effect on you, and that De Courcy is certainly your own..from whence arose so astonishing a misconception of your daughter's feelings!.I think, my dear mother, you would not disapprove of her as a daughter..It is surely my duty to discourage such romantic nonsense.		
All is by this time known to De Courcy, who is now alone with Mr. Johnson..I have sent Charles to town to make matters up if he can, for I do not by any means want her here..I made no comments, however, for words would have been vain..Lady Susan's intentions are of course those of absolute coquetry, or a desire of universal admiration; I cannot for a moment imagine that she has anything more serious in view; but it mortifies me to see a young man of Reginald's sense duped by her at all..I may perhaps do no good but that of relieving my own mind by this letter, but I felt it my duty to tell you that your partiality for Lady Susan is no secret to your friends, and to warn you against her.		
He is convinced that her attempt to run away proceeded from no, justifiable cause, and had no provocation..but some people's feelings are incomprehensible..Mistress of deceit, however, she appeared perfectly unconcerned, and after chatting on indifferent subjects for a short time, said to me, "I find from Wilson that we are going to lose Mr. De Courcyis it true that he leaves Churchhill this morning?".Your affectionate mother, C. DE COURCY..XXIX LADY SUSAN VERNON TO MRS. JOHNSON Upper Seymour Street.		
I am bewildered in my endeavours to form some rational conjecture of what Mrs. Mainwaring can have told you to occasion so extraordinary a change in your sentiments..Such was the first distinguished exploit of Miss Frederica Vernon; and, if we consider that it was achieved at the tender age of sixteen, we shall have room for the most flattering prognostics of her future renown..When she first came I was at some pains to prevent her seeing much of her aunt; but I have relaxed, as I believe I may depend on her observing the rules I have laid down for their discourse..To our family she has always been represented in softened colours by the benevolence of Mr. Charles Vernon, and yet, in spite of his generous endeavours to excuse her, we know that she did, from the most selfish motives, take all possible pains to prevent his marriage with Catherine..Upon the whole, I commend my own conduct in this affair extremely, and regard it as a very happy instance of circumspection and tenderness.		
Far from me be all complaint, every sigh of regret..Frederica makes me very unhappy!.He was actually on the point of leaving Churchhill!.She meant, I suppose, to go to the Clarkes in Staffordshire, for she has no other acquaintances..Were you not blinded by a sort of fascination, it would be ridiculous in me to repeat the instances of great misconduct on her side so very generally known.		
Adieu!.Her applying to Mr. De Courcy hurt me particularly.".I am sure of Sir James at any time, and could make him renew his application by a line..She has been talking a great deal about it to me.."Indeed, I did not doubt your kindness," said she, colouring again, "but I thought Mr. De Courcy could do anything with my mother; but I was mistaken: they have had a dreadful quarrel about it, and he is going away.		
Artlessness will never do in love matters; and that girl is born a simpleton who has it either by nature or affectation..I have never before mentioned the likelihood of its taking place to anyone, because I thought that whilst Frederica continued at school it had better not be known to exist; but now, as I am convinced that Frederica is too old ever to submit to school confinement, and have, therefore, begun to consider her union with Sir James as not very distant, I had intended within a few days to acquaint yourself and Mr. Vernon with the whole business..Your friend Mr. Smith's story, however, cannot be quite correct, as she corresponds regularly with Mrs. Mainwaring..This pathetic representation lasted the whole evening, and so ostentatious and artful a display has entirely convinced me that she did in fact feel nothing..The girl whose heart can distinguish Reginald De Courcy, deserves, however he may slight her, a better fate than to be Sir James Martin's wife.		
We must commit the event to a higher power..I had scarcely concluded my last, when Wilson brought me word of it..I am afraid I have often been too indulgent, but my poor Frederica's temper could never bear opposition well: you must support and encourage me; you must urge the necessity of reproof if you see me too lenient.".She has been sadly neglected, however, and her mother ought to remember it..I made a point also of Frederica's behaving civilly to Sir James, and gave her to understand that I was absolutely determined on her marrying him.		
I am equally confounded at HER impudence and HIS credulity..Its effect on Reginald justifies some portion of vanity, for it was no less favourable than instantaneous..You will, I am sure, my dear Sir, feel the truth of this, and will hereby learn to do justice to the character of a very injured woman..Consideration and esteem as surely follow command of language as admiration waits on beauty, and here I have opportunity enough for the exercise of my talent, as the chief of my time is spent in conversation..Mainwaring is just gone; he brought me the news of his wife's arrival.		
When I wrote to you the other day I was, in truth, in high irritation, and with ample cause..No; I am unalterably fixed on this point, though I have not yet quite decided on the manner of bringing it about..If I am vain of anything, it is of my eloquence..Mr. Vernon declares that he never saw deeper distress than hers, on the receipt of the letter; and is his judgment inferior to mine?.Be that as it may, however, Frederica is returned on my hands; and, having nothing else to employ her, is busy in pursuing the plan of romance begun at Langford.		
She blushed deeply as she answered: "I was so unhappy about Sir James that I could not helpI have done something very wrong, I know; but you have not an idea of the misery I have been in: and mamma had ordered me never to speak to you or my uncle about it, and" "You therefore spoke to my brother to engage his interference," said I, to save her the explanation..Her power over him must now be boundless, as she has entirely effaced all his former illopinion, and persuaded him not merely to forget but to justify her conduct..He then left me, and ran upstairs..I shall probably put off his arrival under some pretence or other..With feelings so poignant as mine, the conviction of having divided the son from his parents would make me, even with you, the most miserable of beings.		
His opinion of her, I am sure, was as low as of any woman in England; and when he first came it was evident that he considered her as one entitled neither to delicacy nor respect, and that he felt she would be delighted with the attentions of any man inclined to flirt with her..All this sounds very reasonable..I must torment my sisterinlaw for the insolent triumph of her look and manner since Sir James has been dismissed; for, in reconciling Reginald to me, I was not able to save that illfated young man; and I must make myself amends for the humiliation to which I have stooped within these few days..But you are fitted for society, and it is shameful to have you exiled from it..To the fortune of a wife, the goodness of my own will make me indifferent, but her family and character must be equally unexceptionable.		
I want to make him sensible of all this, for we know the power of gratitude on such a heart as his; and could Frederica's artless affection detach him from her mother, we might bless the day which brought her to Churchhill..I have not yet tranquillised myself enough to see Frederica..If you will, therefore, have the unspeakably great kindness of taking my part with her, and persuading her to send Sir James away, I shall be more obliged to you than it is possible for me to express..He is so extremely attached to my daughter that he could not exist longer without seeing her..Good bye," he added, shaking my hand with earnestness; "I do not know when you will see me again; but remember what I tell you of Frederica; you MUST make it your business to see justice done her.		
What could I do!.I am, &c., &c, REGINALD DE COURCY XIII LADY DE COURCY TO MRS. VERNON Parklands..When I found that he was not to be laughed out of his design, I calmly begged an explanation, and desired to know by what he was impelled, and by whom commissioned, to reprimand me..I am much obliged to you, my dear Friend, for your advice respecting Mr. De Courcy, which I know was given with the full conviction of its expediency, though I am not quite determined on following it..He gives a very plausible account of her behaviour at Langford; I wish it may be true, but his intelligence must come from herself, and I am less disposed to believe it than to lament the degree of intimacy subsisting between them, implied by the discussion of such a subject.
