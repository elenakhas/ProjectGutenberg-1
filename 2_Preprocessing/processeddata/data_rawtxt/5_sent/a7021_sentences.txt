Lumbrilo is not a hunter, nor could he be certain when and where his magic would go to work.."Which testifies to a trail out of here, fairly welltraveled, and some kind of a usable landing space not too far away," Asaki replied..The animals, they come to learn that after a while..When he was done he shook his head..It has happened too many times lately.		
"Man from the stars, there is no trail so wellhidden that a Ranger of the preserves cannot nose it out, nor any Hunterbe he a two or five bracelet veteranwho can keep pinned down a determined man of the forest service!".The gargoyle head lifted away from the rock, and then turned to one side as its body, somehow vaguely obscene in its resemblance to the human form, fell away, to sprawl limply downslope.."That I know also..Dane watched the medic's eyelids blink slowly..Round eyes were set deeply in sunken pits.		
"Lumbrilo's magic is great," Tau said evenly..Tau came bluntly to the point.."And that could very well serve us.".Or else" Asaki strode down to join his men.."Lions?"		
Could we manage that way until we were over the mountains?".And he wanted no return of sleep tonight..I have focused on myself the enmity of a dangerous man, and now you hope I shall be forced, in selfdefense, to remove him from your path.".There was a wailing cry from the north, a howl of witless fear..And the hand of the Chief Ranger, hanging lax at his side, suddenly balled into a fist.		
Asaki shook his head..As Tau swung around to face the catdog, that creature had no substance either..If any of them slept that night, they did so only in snatches..Had much to do with offworlders?"."There was no trickery," he conceded.		
"A perfect end to a stinking day," remarked Tau dispassionately..And, offworlder, I come from a line of warriorswe do not drink defeat easily!".And it worked on uson mewhen we weren't conditioned.."We shall not know," he breathed, "what is real, what is not.".Safe on the second tussock from the shore, Jellico halted, edged carefully around and used the needler Nymani had left with him.		
A pitting, snarling tangle rolled across the slopeand was gone!.Through the vision lenses he studied the route ahead..Dane would have liked to have taken off his boots, but feared he could not replace them; and he could tell from the way the captain shifted his position that Jellico was in pain too..Twice the medic shuffled about a circle of his own making..Only Lumbrilo does other things which his forefathers did not.		
Asaki discovered a cave before sundown, located not too far from a mountain stream..We'll clean some and then we can rest undisturbed," was his superior's comment..Asaki's voice was expressionless..It strove to soften him into clay another could remold.."Salt crust!"		
The offworlder turned to his own men with a sharp order..Those who did not, also did not live to father others who might have had the same lack..Asaki spun to face northward, though there was nothing to be seen there except the unshaken wall of the jungle..The ghost of that which was not a man had reached the shore of the island, stood there, its blank head turned toward them..Dane raised his head from the shelter of his folded arms.		
Since both the captain and Tau appeared to accept the situation, Dane, not quite understanding it all, was prepared to follow their lead.."Neither did I," Tau remarked..His own hands went to the knife sheath at his belt.."I wouldn't want to chance it, unless we are left with no other choice..Lumbrilo does not accept his proper place in the scheme of things!"		
Yet Dane, stopping to drink sparingly from his canteen, could not lose that sense of eyes upon him, of being tracked..I wish to show you the roosts of the fastals..You can go without water just so long...." "I'd like to have a little talk with Lumbrilo," remarked Jellico, the mildness in his voice very deceptive.."I do not deny that, spaceman.".Then with a visible effort he controlled his emotions and came to Tau, looming over the slighter medic almost menacingly.		
"How!".Now there was a glow against the darkfire ahead?.Had they come clear across the swamp, Dane wondered dully, or was this only a large island in the midst of the stinking boglands?."You said that you must wait for the return of your other crew membersshall we say midafternoon tomorrow?".Nymani joined his superior.		
He gave a curt nod and Nymani skidded on down the mountain side.."Who knows?.Bitter water, Dane thought, trying to flex his still swollen toes, was going to be the least of his worries in the morning..But the captain and the two Khatkans stood calmly assessing the slaughter left by the hide poachers..Asaki continued his task, but there was a glint in his dark eyes as he butchered with sure and expert strokes.		
"I'd like to see one of those trees before sundown..If there is a canker of trouble on Khatka, then Lumbrilo is close to its root."."This is between you and me..If Nymani spied upon them, then they have spied upon us in turn..The third met a ray from Nymani's needler.		
"Not the same perhaps" But Asaki had already grasped the situation, was looking ahead..And it is our desire to make it the best for tridee hunters.."Who can say?."True enough..Now he was only an arm'slength away from the medic.		
Jellico snorted..The debris of the nest smoked into nothing..And we'd furnish hostages of a sortespecially the Chief Ranger..It was after they left the second station that the flitter swung farther out eastward, again climbing over the chain of heights to sight one of the newly discovered wonders the staff at the last station had reporteda crater lake..Tau commented bitterly, hunching well forward so that a certain stung portion of his anatomy would not come in contact with the rock beneath him.		
But the Chief Ranger leaped from behind his sheltering rock to the one where the captain had taken refuge and pulled him into the open.."And I am now your weapon, which you hope will be as successful as that needler you are carrying."."Where walks this longtoothed shadow of yours now?".He had come with his father's blood brother, Assha, who was a noted far voyager, and it was an honor to be chosen as donkeyleader for such a one as Assha..Grassy plains rippled under the wind of a fair day.		
But he added no more than just the reassurance of their escape..You might slip up and use them at the wrong moment..As they clung together there was a cry from behind them, underlined by a shot..Underneath and around them the floor, walls, and ceiling of the room moved as if they had been pried from their setting of ice and were being rolled about by the exploring thumb and forefinger of some impatient giant..The man in the doorway took the bait, coming forward far enough for Ross to send the door slamming shut as he himself sprang with the belt aimed for the other's head.		
Kelgarries to come along and pick us up?".Then he was rolled back, to lie blinking up at his enemies..His session in the lifeboat had restored his strength, but a man could not live forever without food and water..He started up again and once more swung the cat to the left..The wizard danced about him, a hideous figure in a beast mask, a curled fringe of dried snakeskins swaying from his belt.		
"Your friends late?"."Ashe!".He looked to Ashe..Instead, he stared at Ross long and measuringly, his eyes growing colder and less friendly with every second of that examination..We have guns; go back a little and you'll find them waving swords and shooting guys with bows and arrowsthose that don't wear tin plate on them to stop being punctured" "Only they were, after all," commented Ashe.		
He was hungry when he awoke, and with that hunger his rebellion sparked into flame..Minutes passed before Foscar's arm raised in a wave to summon the party guarding Ross.."So" Ashe turned upon the tribesman"and by whose word did you go hunting my kinsman, Lal?."Look here, Murdock, maybe you think it's easy to break out of here..Ross rose to his knees with an involuntary gasp as a scream cut through the night.		
He didn't know what he was trying to learn, only that it seemed important at that moment to press home to at least one of the tribesmen that he was different from the man who had put a price on his head and to whom he was to be sold..The quiet man went down the hall, leaving Assha before a door.."Buta spaceship!".The trace continued down the slope..The superstitions of the people would lead them to shun both the site of the post and Ashe himself as cursed and taboo.		
He tried the only two doors opening out of the hall, but they were secured on the other side..It argued that Foscar did not trust those he was about to do business with, that he was taking certain precautions of his own..A toe jarred into his ribs, and Ross bit back the grunt of pain which answered that rude bid for his attention..Lal stared at him, his woebegone face still smeared with tears..What happened, McNeil?"		
Steal one of those atomjets?.CHAPTER 14 "... that's my half of it..They might just come up with a useful hint..Then, having rubbed down both animals with twists of grass, the man came over to Ross, pushed him back to the ground, and studied his left leg..There was more fire and the horse changed course through the rising smoke.		
There was a single despairing squeak out of the grass about a hundred feet away, and the winged shape arose again with its prey..But they have it firmly planted in their minds now that there are devils after them..Yet in the darkness there came those who would slay without profit, for what reason I have no knowing.".He limped into the outer air where the shadows of evening were beginning to creep across the ground..A high, screeching call, unlike any shout he had heard, split the clamor.		
And how had Lurgha spoken?.How it had happened he did not know, but it was true..The clothing which adapted so skillfully to his measurements.... Ross leaned forward to study the devices on the control board, confirming his suspicions..And it is she who has brought you to us now..Yes, he was from the south.		
In fact, the roads themselves were under the protection of the gods; there was peace on them for all wayfarers..The fugitives had taken cover in an angle where the massed remains of an old avalanche provided a cavepocket..Kurt caught him up..Hodaki was considering that..We must move now."		
Here were five oval buttons, marked in the same vivid green as that which trimmed his clothingtwo wiggles, a dot, a double bar, a pair of entwined circles, and a crosshatch..He raised his hand to explore that old hurt near his hairline that had been so tender only yesterday that it could not bear pressure..Color rippled across it with every twist and turn he gave to the lengthdark blue fading to pale violet, accented with wavering streaks of vivid and startling green..On his cushioned feet he padded back to the stairway, and he stood there listening..Get anything out of this, Webb?"		
Lal wailed again, but when that fire was followed by no other manifestation he ventured to raise his head once more.."My chief is not here," Ross repeated wearily, making a protest he knew they would not heed.."These are not from the village..Ross smiled thinly, an expression far removed and years older than his bashful boy's grin of the shy act..Of course, it was possible that Kurt was a stool pigeon, leading him on as a test.		
So!.The cat must be traveling at its best pace, Ross thought..Ross, Ashe's gun in hand, kept watch on the transfer plate, ready to shoot at anything appearing there.."Some sleeps away" "Some sleeps!"."That is a question to which our psychologists are still trying to find the answer, my young friend.		
The climber was very close..Ashe chewed a broiled wing reflectively..His bow and dagger were gone, and he did not even have his long cloak pin for a weapon, since he had given that to Frigga..Then they swept into a noisy place where the shouting of many men made a din..Couldn't they be working right at the main source, sir?"		
Was this an elaborate joke?.The boyishness which had been a part of him when he had fought at Foscar's command was gone..Do you understand?".My chief there.".The tribesman fastened the mounts and then walked around to inspect the animal Ross had ridden.		
That brought Ashe up, leaning forward on his good elbow..Firethere was something about fireif he could only remember!.He halted his galloping mount to sit facing the handful of strangers..One need only to look upon him to know that he was of trader blood and no uncivilized woodsrunner..The blue curve gave under his assault.		
Their big base must be in this time sector!".The Guardian considered her answer gravely..Hair grew on his head, black and thick and there was a faint shadow of beard on his jaw line..Varta stopped trying to follow the conversationLur was only explaining now how they had found the space man and brought him out of the wrecked ship..The Guardian paused for so long that Varta dared to prompt it.		
She examined the flowers closely, to all appearances they were perfect and natural.."Why not?.This is indeed a mystery!"."It is no enemy" But she did not need that reassurance from Lur.."We walk again the ways of men," Lur was the first to note the tool marks on the stone where they lay.		
Memphir has fallen to the barbarians of the Outer Lands and now I go, as Asti once ordered.".It is the water itself which livesand yet does not live" His thought trailed away from her as he struggled with some problem..It was a drooping shoot of the turbi, the same tree vine which produced the fruit she had relished less than an hour before..All things are possible by the Will of Asti.".But of this side of the mountains both were ignorant, for Memphir's rule had not run here.		
"Asti!"."What is it?".Varta pointed with her chin to the left where, some distance away, the mountain wall paralleled their course..Delicately Lur sought a way into the other's mind, twisting down paths of thought strange to him.."Let us go."		
The visage it revealed was long and gray, with dark pits for eyes and a gaping, fangstudded, lipless mouth..She leaned back against a rock..Seenow he awakens."."It cooks the flesh, we can not walk here," was his verdict..She knew what Lur meant, the suit which had protected her in the underworld was impervious to everything outside its surfaceor to every substance its makers knewjust as Lur's own hide made his flesh impenetrable.		
If it was His Will which had brought them here, then Asti's power would wrap her round with safety..It is the scent of them which you catch" "No.."There is no door" she pointed out doubtfully..He was one of a race who had come to Erb from beyond the stars and discovered it a world without human life: So they had established colonies and built great citiesfar different from Memphirand had lived in peace for centuries of their own time..her astonishment broke into open speech.		
There was a grating, as from metal long unused, and a block fell back, opening a narrow door to them.."Man made," he cautioned, "but very, very old."."No, but we can enter into it!".Perhaps He has some use for us and it!".But below the surface of the water Varta's breath hissed between her teeth and Lur's head snapped around as he caught her thought.		
There are other worlds than Erb, mayhap this strange thing was a sky ship from such a world..It is a pity he is dead" Varta felt a rich warm tide rising in her throat to answer that teasing half question..But what made this?".There are two paths before you.".The two of us can not draw that out of the water!"		
The muscles of his forelegs and quarters stood out in sharp relief under his scales, his fangs were bare as his lips snapped back with effort..Of the truth of that I have no proof.".By the glint of sunlight on the stone around them the day was already well advanced..By His Will she had come out of Memphir over ways no human of Erb had ever trod before..It was he who spied the spring on the mountain side above, a spring of water uncontaminated by the strange life of the lake.		
And yetthere a few feet below was strong metal!.Lur's tongue shot out to impale a questing beetle..But even as he dipped his fanged muzzle toward that inviting surface, Lur's spined head jerked erect again..As she moved into the secret way, the five orbs swung with her, and in the darkness there the sun glowed richly, sending out a light to guide their feet..If the records of the Temple spoke true, these curls of gas were death to all lunged creatures of the upper world.		
And in a moment she too saw a dark hulk nosing through the vapor..Did you expect a serpent?.No human brain could follow his unless he willed it so..After that he remembered nothing.."If ever men had wisdom to produce thisit was not of Asti's giving," she edged away from the glare.		
There were supplies here too, lying untouched in ageless containers within a lizardskin pouch..How long they journeyed down into the maw of the mountain and, beyond that, into the womb of Erb itself, Varta never knew.."But that was long ago..Lur was pulling at a small door half hidden by a mass of twisted wires and plates and, just as Varta crawled around this obstacle to join him, the barrier gave way allowing them to squeeze through into what had once been the living quarters of the ship..But they were not alive, she was almost sure of that, they appeared more a part of the water itself.		
Slowly the girl breasted the water which filled the cabin and reached her hands toward the bowed helmet of the prisoner..But mayhap there were those who raised cities on Erb before the first hut of Memphir squatted on tidal mud.."Then let us keep to the jungle over there and see if it does not bring around to the far side..With Lur at her heels the girl edged around to pull cautiously at the branch..Varta touched her tongue without fear to a powdered restorative, sharing it with Lur, whose own mailed skin would protect him through the dangers to come.		
Lur might hold out the promise of the flowers, but this was a man and he had lain in the water for countless ages So she went with lagging steps, to find Lur busy..Varta squatted back on her heels and began to look at the water and then at the banks with more care..Let Lur now quiet this outlander..Varta returned to the lake shore reluctantly..She held the sun on a line with one of the wrist bonds, She must avoid the flesh it imprisoned, for Asti's power could kill.		
"How can you tell when that branch first dipped into the lake?.Could she doubt that His Protection was with her now?."But what weapon could do this?."It was a machine in which men traveled," his thoughts arose to her..When it had done, the girl stooped and altered two of the lines with a swift stroke from one of her talons.		
The sealed compartment was hardly more than a cupboard but it was full.."Memphir was old..Varta recognized seats, a table, and other bits of strictly utilitarian furniture.."This will take you down into my country," it jerked the rod to the right..The long talons fitted to the finger tips of the gloves, the claws of the webbed foot coverings clamped fast to every hand and foot hold, but the way down was long and she caught a message of weariness from Lur before they reached the piled rocks at the foot of the cliff.
