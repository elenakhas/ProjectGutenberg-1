But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:      Would it have been worth while      If one, settling a  pillow or throwing off a shawl,      And turning toward the window, should say:        "That is not it at all,        That is not what I meant, at all."...Tiens, voilà dix sous, pour la salledebains....III      The October night comes down; returning as before      Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease      I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door      And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.

and what if she should die some afternoon,      Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;      Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand      With the smoke coming down above the housetops;      Doubtful, for quite a while      Not knowing what to feel or if I understand      Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon...

I have seen eyes in the street  Trying to peer through lighted shutters,  And a crab one afternoon in a pool,  An old crab with barnacles on his back,  Gripped the end of a stick which I held him..Why we have not developed into friends.".I have seen them riding seaward on the waves  Combing the white hair of the waves blown back  When the wind blows the water white and black..I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark  Suddenly, his expression in a glass..My smile falls heavily among the bricabrac.		
We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole  Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger tips..And I have known the arms already, known them all  Arms that are braceleted and white and bare  (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!).And I have known the eyes already, known them all  The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,  And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,  When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,  Then how should I begin  To spit out all the buttends of my days and ways?.Smoothed by long fingers,  Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,  Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.."You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,  And how, how rare and strange it is, to find  In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,  (For indeed I do not love it ... you knew?

II  The morning comes to consciousness  Of faint stale smells of beer  From the sawdusttrampled street  With all its muddy feet that press  To early coffeestands..And I must borrow every changing  find expression ... dance, dance  Like a dancing bear,  Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape..Is it perfume from a dress  That makes me so digress?.you are not blind!.I keep my countenance,  I remain selfpossessed  Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired  Reiterates some wornout common song  With the smell of hyacinths across the garden  Recalling things that other people have desired.		
I heard the beat of centaurs' hoofs over the hard turf  As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon..Are these ideas right or wrong?.The memory throws up high and dry  A crowd of twisted things;  A twisted branch upon the beach  Eaten smooth, and polished  As if the world gave up  The secret of its skeleton,  Stiff and white..In the palace of Mrs. Phlaccus, at Professor ChanningCheetah's  He laughed like an irresponsible foetus..Only the friendship and the sympathy  Of one about to reach her journey's end.

I thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birchtrees,  And of Priapus in the shrubbery  Gaping at the lady in the swing..Aunt Helen  Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt,  And lived in a small house near a fashionable square  Cared for by servants to the number of four..To find a friend who has these qualities,  Who has, and gives  Those qualities upon which friendship lives......But what have I, but what have I, my friend,  To give you, what can you receive from me?		
His laughter was submarine and profound  Like the old man of the seats  Hidden under coral islands  Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence,  Dropping from fingers of surf..Cousin Nancy  Miss Nancy Ellicot  Strode across the hills and broke them  Rode across the hills and broke them  The barren New England hills  Riding to hounds  Over the cowpasture..And how should I begin?."So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul  Should be resurrected only among friends  Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom  That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.".Memory!		
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach..Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,  Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?.And would it have been worth it, after all,  After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,  Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,  Would it have been worth while,  To have bitten off the matter with a smile,  To have squeezed the universe into a ball  To roll it toward some overwhelming question,  To say: "I am Lazarus, come from the dead,  Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all"  If one, settling a pillow by her head,    Should say: "That is not what I meant at all;    That is not it, at all.".Do I dare to eat a peach?.Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;  The worlds revolve like ancient women  Gathering fuel in vacant lots.		
My selfpossession flares up for a second;  This is as I had reckoned..Halfpast one,  The street lamp sputtered,  The street lamp muttered,  The street lamp said,  "Regard that woman  Who hesitates toward you in the light of the door  Which opens on her like a grin..*         *         *         *  And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!.So the hand of a child, automatic  Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay..Halfpast two,  The street lamp said,  "Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,  Slips out its tongue  And devours a morsel of rancid butter."		
Halfpast three,  The lamp sputtered,  The lamp muttered in the dark..And so the conversation slips  Among velleities and carefully caught regrets  Through attenuated tones of violins  Mingled with remote cornets  And begins..You will write, at any rate..The voice returns like the insistent outoftune  Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:  "I am always sure that you understand  My feelings, always sure that you feel,  Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand..I could see nothing behind that child's eye.		
"And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?.With the other masquerades  That time resumes,  One thinks of all the hands  That are raising dingy shades  In a thousand furnished rooms..Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl..And how should I presume?.Now when she died there was silence in heaven  And silence at her end of the street.		
The burntout ends of smoky days..Upon the glazen shelves kept watch  Matthew and Waldo, guardians of the faith,  The army of unalterable law..We must leave it now to fate..The Jew Of Malta  I  Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon  You have the scene arrange itselfas it will seem to do  With "I have saved this afternoon for you";  And four wax candles in the darkened room,  Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,  An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb  Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.."He is a charming man""But after all what did he mean?"		
*         *         *         *  Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets  And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes  Of lonely men in shirtsleeves, leaning out of windows?.Six o'clock..And when all the world came back  And the light crept up between the shutters,  And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,  You had such a vision of the street  As the street hardly understands;  Sitting along the bed's edge, where  You curled the papers from your hair,  Or clasped the yellow soles of feet  In the palms of both soiled hands..III  You tossed a blanket from the bed,  You lay upon your back, and waited;  You dozed, and watched the night revealing  The thousand sordid images  Of which your soul was constituted;  They flickered against the ceiling..I should have been a pair of ragged claws  Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.		
III  The October night comes down; returning as before  Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease  I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door  And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees..Shall I part my hair behind?.And should I then presume?."I have been wondering frequently of late  (But our beginnings never know our ends!).  "He has pointed ears ... he must be unbalanced,"  "There was something he said that I might have challenged."		
Among the windings of the violins  And the ariettes  Of cracked cornets  Inside my brain a dull tomtom begins  Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,  Capricious monotone  That is at least one definite "false note.".He has no dissociative faculty..The second point marks an obvious error of detail; the first is too crude a statement to be accepted; to say that he failed because his genius was unsuited to tragedy is to tell us nothing at all..These passages are comparable to the best bombast of Kyd or Marlowe, with a greater command of language and a greater control of the emotion..So with Blake, his early poems are technically admirable, and their originality is in an occasional rhythm.		
The beauty of Swinburne’s verse is the sound,” people say, explaining, he had little visual imagination.” I am inclined to think that the word beauty” is hardly to be used in connection with Swinburne’s verse at all; but in any case the beauty or effect of sound is neither that of music nor that of poetry which can be set to music..The Hamlet of Laforgue is an adolescent; the Hamlet of Shakespeare is not, he has not that explanation and excuse..I do not propose to analyse the difference (it would be a valuable chapter in social history); the American solemnity, it is enough to say, is more primitive, more academic, more like that of the German professor..But having dealt with three English writers of what may be called critical prose, one’s mind becomes conscious of the fact that they have something in common, and, trying to perceive more clearly what this community is, and suspecting that it is a national quality, one is impelled to meditate upon the strongest contrast possible..None of the obvious complaints that were or might have been brought to bear upon the first Poems and Ballads holds good.		
The alteration is not complete enough, however, to be convincing..You cannot point to it in the speeches; indeed, if you examine the two famous soliloquies you see the versification of Shakespeare, but a content which might be claimed by another, perhaps by the author of the Revenge of Bussy d’Ambois, Act V. sc..In sentimental drama it appears in a degraded form, when we are evidently intended to accept the character’s sentimental interpretation of himself..And if literature is to Swinburne merely a passion, we are tempted to say that to George Wyndham it was a hobby, and to Mr. Whibley almost a charming showman’s show (we are charmed by the urbanity of the showman)..To have held the centre of the stage for two hours in a rôle which requires both extreme violence and restraint, a rôle which requires simple force and subtle variation; to have sustained so difficult a rôle almost without support; this was a legitimate success.		
Swinburne’s words must always be referred back to Swinburne himself..But from passages like the first we may be permitted to infer that Massinger was unconscious of trying to develop a different kind of character from any that Marlowe or Jonson had invented..These poets were certainly obliged to consume vast energy in this pursuit of form, which could never lead to a wholly satisfying result..And we have named three of Massinger’s best..In order to fit into our estimate of Massinger the two admirable comedies—A New Way to Pay Old Debts and The City Madam—a more extensive research would be required than is possible within our limits.		
But such a nature was not at hand, and Massinger precedes, not another Shakespeare, but Milton..Blake’s poetry has the unpleasantness of great poetry..Wyndham was a Romantic; the only cure for Romanticism is to analyse it..The point of view which I am struggling to attack is perhaps related to the metaphysical theory of the substantial unity of the soul: for my meaning is, that the poet has, not a personality” to express, but a particular medium, which is only a medium and not a personality, in which impressions and experiences combine in peculiar and unexpected ways..The critics of the romantic period were pioneers, and exhibit the fallibility of discoverers.		
If you examine any of Shakespeare’s more successful tragedies, you will find this exact equivalence; you will find that the state of mind of Lady Macbeth walking in her sleep has been communicated to you by a skilful accumulation of imagined sensory impressions; the words of Macbeth on hearing of his wife’s death strike us as if, given the sequence of events, these words were automatically released by the last event in the series..It employed all the conventions, the theatricalities, of the modern stage; yet her personality triumphed over not only Professor Murray’s verse but her own training..Critics are often interested—but not quite in the nominal subject, often in something a little beside the point; they are often learned—but not quite to the point either..There are some poets whose every line has unique value..I’m not taken     With a cobswan or a highmounting bull,     As foolish Leda and Europa were;     But the bright gold, with Danaë.		
(Tennyson, Dora) In Faustus Marlowe went farther: he broke up the line, to a gain in intensity, in the last soliloquy; and he developed a new and important conversational tone in the dialogues of Faustus with the devil..If you look at Catiline—that dreary Pyrrhic victory of tragedy—you find two passages to be successful: Act II..We need some one—not a member of the Church of Rome, and perhaps preferably not a member of the Church of England—to explain how vital a matter it is, if Aristotle may be said to have been a moral pilot of Europe, whether we shall or shall not drop that pilot..This leads us to the question of Humours..Does the silkworm expend her yellow labours     For thee?		
The bad poet dwells partly in a world of objects and partly in a world of words, and he never can get them to fit..M. Julien Benda has the formal beauty which the American critics lack, and a close affinity to them in point of view..And it appears to be satire..For one thing, the stage appeals to too many demands besides the demand for art for that to be possible; and also we need, unfortunately, something more than refined automatons..But at this point the impression is emotional; the reader in the ignorance which we postulate is unable to distinguish the poetry from an emotional state aroused in himself by the poetry, a state which may be merely an indulgence of his own emotions.		
This impression may be so deep that no subsequent study and understanding will intensify it..It is pertinent, at least, to remark that Marlowe’s rhetoric” is not, or not characteristically, Shakespeare’s rhetoric; that Marlowe’s rhetoric consists in a pretty simple huffesnuffe bombast, while Shakespeare’s is more exactly a vice of style, a tortured perverse ingenuity of images which dissipates instead of concentrating the imagination, and which may be due in part to influences by which Marlowe was untouched..or to Professor Bradley?.From the point of view of literature, the drama is only one among several poetic forms..Massinger: And now, in the evening,             When thou shoud'st pass with honour to thy rest,             Wilt thou fall like a meteor?		
Largely on the evidence of the two Humour plays, it is sometimes assumed that Jonson is occupied with types; typical exaggerations, or exaggerations of type..The French Intelligence As the inspection of types of English irresistibly provoked a glance at two American critics, so the inspection of the latter leads our attention to the French..But almost no one, today, will wish to read the whole of Swinburne..When it is a matter of pronouncing judgment between two poets, Swinburne is almost unerring..But satire like Jonson’s is great in the end not by hitting off its object, but by creating it; the satire is merely the means which leads to the æsthetic result, the impulse which projects a new world into a new orbit.		
and the superb additions to Hieronimo.”[7] Footnote 7:   Of the authorship it can only be said that the lines are by some   admirer of Marlowe..It is strange that Swinburne should have hinted at a similarity to Jonson and not mentioned a far more striking affinity of Chapman’s—that is, Donne..He lived in no fairyland, but his mind went out and became a part of things..Here, in fact, is our text: to elucidate this sentence would be to account for Massinger..This is really a point of capital importance.		
He exercises neither of the tools of the critic: comparison and analysis..The scene in Julius Cæsar is right because the object of our attention is not the speech of Antony (Bedeutung) but the effect of his speech upon the mob, and Antony’s intention, his preparation and consciousness of the effect..We think of Shakespeare perhaps as the dramatist who concentrates everything into a sentence, Pray you undo this button,” or Honest honest Iago”; we forget that there is a rhetoric proper to Shakespeare at his best period which is quite free from the genuine Shakespearean vices either of the early period or the late..The ability to perform that slight distortion of all the elements in the world of a play or a story, so that this world is complete in itself, which was given to Marlowe and Jonson (and to Rabelais) and which is prerequisite to great farce, was denied to Massinger..And we do not quite say that the new is more valuable because it fits in; but its fitting in is a test of its value—a test, it is true, which can only be slowly and cautiously applied, for we are none of us infallible judges of conformity.		
In the Agamemnon, the artistic emotion approximates to the emotion of an actual spectator; in Othello to the emotion of the protagonist himself..As for the last alternative, it is not to be entertained; as for the second, what type do we prefer?.And as it recalls other scenes—there is a suggestion of the college of ladies in The Silent Woman—it looks like a comedy scene..And it is at the same time what makes a writer most acutely conscious of his place in time, of his contemporaneity..There remains to define this process of depersonalization and its relation to the sense of tradition.		
And as in France, so in England, the more farcical comedy was the more serious..Such men as Tylor, and Robertson Smith, and Wilhelm Wundt, who early fertilized the soil, would hardly recognize the resulting vegetation; and indeed poor Wundt’s Völkerpsychologie was a musty relic before it was translated..Or he might have studied through the literature to the mind of that century; he might, by dissection and analysis, have helped us to some insight into the feeling and thought which we seem to have left so far away..The usual conclusion is either that conditions” are too much for us, or that we really prefer other types of literature, or simply that we are uninspired..The verse of Edward III deserves study.		
Shakespeare: ’Tis in my memory locked,               And you yourself shall keep the key of it..The meanings which it has been obliged to shoulder have been mostly opprobrious; but if a precise meaning can be found for it this meaning may occasionally represent a virtue..[5] Footnote 5:   I should except The Dynasts..But at least Marlowe has, in a few words, concentrated him into a statement..One is by isolating the essential, by pointing out the most intense in various kinds and separating it from the accidents of environment.		
The words fall with as determined beat as if they were the will of the morose Dictator himself..In the indefinable touches which make up the music of a verse [says     Boyle], in the artistic distribution of pauses, and in the unerring     choice and grouping of just those words which strike the ear as the     perfection of harmony, there are, if we leave Cyril Tourneur’s     Atheist’s Tragedy out of the question, only two masters in the     drama, Shakespeare in his latest period and Massinger..And you may say: rhetoric; but if we are to call it rhetoric” we must subject that term to a closer dissection than any to which it is accustomed..If, then, we must be very careful in applying terms of censure, like diffuse,” we must be equally careful of praise..There are others who need be read only in selections, but what selections are read will not very much matter.
