For balance of pen a few stakes, bark or slabs cut from a tree..4..Go about building it this way: First select the spot where you have reason to believe that bear inhabit; now having made your selection, get a level place and on this spot lay a course of logs with the top flattened off; this may be eight by three feet..Next lay a binder on top of the pen and upon either end of the short course of logs; pin the binders at either end so the bear cannot raise the top off the pen..Next a stout little birch or spruce is selected and a section of three or four cut off.		
This done, drive a staple in tree over wire running from spike to limb, which will prevent the animal being pulled over the limb and escaping..3 is another stub driven in ground for bait stick No..It will be seen that an animal pushing against the door, from the outside, raises it, but once on the inside the more they push against it the tighter it becomes..MARTEN should be stretched and dried on boards, fur side in, but turned as soon as dried..See cuts for the rest.

This trap does not take long to make, as no pen need be built, the top stone is large enough to strike the animal, making no difference in what position it gets when after the bait..LYNX should be cased and after drying properly are turned fur side out, same as foxes..In the North, many trappers have such long lines that they do not get over them only once a week..Turn trigger across opening slanted slightly in, then you get them by neck or shoulders..The illustration shows a square block with the hole bored in the side.		
I have often visited traps of old trappers, where from two to five carcasses were hanging from a nearby sapling..But on land they go and it was by deadfalls the wayback Indians killed a many that were in their packs at the end of the hunting season..Then the bait will lay on the foundation of trap within 5 or 6 inches of front of the trap..SKUNK should be cased fur side in and stretched on boards for several days..No trapper should have more traps or longer lines than he can properly attend to.
