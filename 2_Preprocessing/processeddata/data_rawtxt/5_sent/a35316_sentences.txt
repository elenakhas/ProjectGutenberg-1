But the Astronomer said, "Even if you had been entering an empty room, son, there would be no cause for slamming a door.".So much Slim realized to be true..Slim reached reluctantly..Carbon and hydrogen..IV Slim started at the sound of footsteps and brightened when it turned out to be only Red.		
What's doing back at the house?".There is no point in any publicity now," when they heard the screams..It won't hurt you.."I've sprained something..The Merchant's eyes were already closed.		
"No.".He allowed his to do the same.."It is for that reason I agreed to see them after I received your letter..He wouldn't be so interested if it was anything else.".Anyway, we don't want them coming here after me."		
I had my eye peeled, you bet.".She had not entirely recovered by the time she reached them, running and running.."I'm not going to tell..RedI mean" "No, no..It's his job."		
"See..Slim shook his head slightly.."They don't hurt you," said Red..He said, "Hi, Dad.."They can't talk our language.		
"Sure, because it's probably a scoutship.".I'm not hanging around here and getting disintegratored..Our race has as much of it as it ever had.".They are not landhungry..We will be back to village economy and then to what?		
He made soundless words, "Did the animals get loose?".He said, "You mean Slim came in here and said I had an animal?.The Industrialist's son pointed imperiously and the Astronomer's son nodded and made off at a run toward the house..Red said, "All right for you.".I wouldn't have taken the meat only they wouldn't eat grass or leaves and we couldn't find good nuts or berries and cook never lets me have anything or I would have asked her and I didn't know it was for lunch and" He was speaking on the sheer momentum of terror and did not realize that his mother did not hear him but, with eyes frozen and popping at the cage, was screaming in thin, piercing tones.		
"I suppose it would do no harm to walk toward the hill."."Hey!.Less work is done..Together they trotted up the rise, Red, as usual, in the lead.."Then, sir, consider that for a long time our astronomers have believed that two general classes of planetary bodies existed.		
"Huh.."Reason would say so, if what you say is true..Aluminum?".It was about then that the Explorer felt the heavy throbbing of the engines.."As I speak to you.		
There are millions of worlds suitable for them in the Galaxy..I went back to the spaceship..She had to change the lunch menu and that means she won't be worth living with for a week..The Industrialist turned once more to his son.."There's no fun in watching.		
Good cooks aren't easy to get..He said, "I don't know, Dad.."Yes, they can.."Well, Holy Smokes..Dad and your father are walking around.		
He looked sick..The Astronomer broke in again..How, I wonder."."Who?."Whyjust exploring, sir."		
Red rose to his feet; an elaborate attitude of boredom all about him..From Beforethewars.".He said, "I suppose you're right..he yelled..You don't give a fellow a chance."		
Slim was flushed..The race was young when that was built, eh?".Change would be good for us.".You probably won't live the day out.".It is simply that they don't have to do any of that.		
These visitors of mine had their atomic bomb, or whatever their equivalent was on their own worlds, and survived it, because they didn't give up..Don't be afraid of falling.".A fellow can't spend all his time on them..Fewer books are written..So you see, they have all the worlds they wish.		
They were descending too quickly..If we don't complain about a change in lunch menu, why should she?"."They want magnesium?.Red quavered, "Hello, ma!".The Industrialist pointed out the window.		
"Well, then, if you wish me to speak, I would suggest that you strap on your Floater and help me prepare the Ejector.".There'll be no second landing..They can project thoughts.".The innermost shell could hold only 2 electrons, the next 8, the next 18 and so on..In order to do that, wires would have to be sealed into a glass tube from which all (or almost all) the air was withdrawn.		
[Illustration: Dmitri Mendeléev and Bohuslav Brauner in Prague in 1900..The same was true of thorium (atomic number 90), which began a series that also ended with lead..The isotopes could be referred to as lead206, lead207, and lead208..A solid might turn into a gas; a single substance might change into two or three different substances, but whatever happened, the total mass at the end was exactly the same (as nearly as chemists could tell) as at the beginning..Suppose the sun’s mass were a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen and it were burning at a rate sufficient to produce the energy at the rate it was giving it off.		
If, after being pulled apart, the atoms are allowed to come together again, they give off energy..Scientists began to speculate that electricity, like matter, might consist of tiny units..Soddy had worked out the way in which atomic weights altered every time an alpha particle or a beta particle was given off by an atom..Thomson’s instrument was the first one capable of separating isotopes and such instruments came to be called mass spectrometers”..In 1900, indeed, Becquerel studied the beta particles and found them to be identical in mass and charge with electrons.		
There were positive ions made up of atoms or groups of atoms, from which one or more of the electrons within the atoms had been removed..Uranium was the first element found to be radioactive..When electricity broke up a molecule, perhaps a unit of electricity attached itself to each atom..At least elements with atomic numbers of 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, 87, and 91 were still not known..This seemed to show that the cathode rays possessed mass and were a stream of atomlike particles, rather than a beam of massless light.		
In 1911 he noted that when X rays passed through atoms, some were absorbed and some bounced back..What’s more, alpha particles were being emitted at velocities of perhaps 30,000 kilometers per second, while the lighter beta particles were being shot off at velocities of up to 250,000 kilometers per second (about 0.8 times the velocity of light)..If only the innermost shell contained electrons and it were filled with the 2 electrons that were all it could hold, then that was a stable arrangement..It also produced important changes in matter..But what if an atom did not have its electron shell so neatly filled.		
There was such a close connection, in fact, that Moseley could arrange the elements in order according to the wavelength of the characteristic X rays..He suggested that the sun was contracting..Working backward, however, it seemed that 25 million years ago, the sun must have been so large as to fill the earth’s orbit..When the X rays struck atoms of high atomic weight, the X rays that bounced back were particularly penetrating..By 1906 Rutherford had worked out the nature of the alpha particles.		
If it attached a negative unit of electricity to itself it would be pulled in the other direction..If all the energy delivered by a gram of uranium in the course of its radioactivity over many billions of years was totalled, it was enormously greater than the energy produced by the burning of a candle with a mass equal to that of uranium..Was that fractional atomic weight something that was possessed by all neon atoms without exception or was it the average of some lightweight atoms and some heavyweight ones?.In the first years of the 19th century, it was found that a current of electricity could cause different atoms or different groups of atoms to move in opposite directions through a liquid in which they were dissolved..One of those involved in the search was the French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel (18521908).		
[Illustration: Antoine Henri Becquerel.] At once, physicists became fascinated with X rays and began searching for them everywhere..But what was the mysterious radiation emitted by uranium and thorium?.This increases the chance that some molecules will be broken up into separate atoms (though the actual process is rather complicated)..Until then, uranium had not been of much interest to chemists..All the rest of the atom was filled with the very light electrons.		
The answer wasn’t easy to get..He used the rise in temperature as a measure of the energy..Heat is a form of energy, since it will expand steam that will force wheels into motion that can then do work..For instance, hydrogen gas, as it is found on earth, is made up of molecules containing 2 hydrogen atoms each (H₂)..There are various forms of energy.		
Electricity did more than radiate through matter, however..This work of Rutherford and Soddy began a line of investigation that by 1907 had shown that there was a whole radioactive chain of elements, each one breaking down to the next in line by giving off either an alpha particle or a beta particle, until finally a lead atom was formed that was not radioactive..The 2 ions, with opposite charges, would cling together, since opposite charges attract, and thus the molecule of sodium fluoride (NaF) would be formed..Others, in addition to Becquerel, were soon investigating the new phenomenon..That is, a moving hammer will drive a nail into wood, while the same hammer held motionlessly against the nailhead will not do so.		
If the atomic weight of some element happens to be very close to a whole number to begin with, it may consist of a single kind of atom..Anything capable of performing work is said to possess energy” from Greek words meaning work within”..The amount of energy in burning wood could be measured if it were mixed with air and allowed to burn in a closed container that was immersed in a known quantity of water..The energy in a match flame is enough to raise the temperature of the mixture and to make the hydrogen and oxygen molecules move about more rapidly and more energetically..It did not seem impossible that such a rule might exist, since one had been found in connection with matter that appeared in even greater variety than energy did.		
Helmholtz calculated that the sun’s contraction over the 6000 years of recorded history would have reduced its diameter only 560 miles—a change that would not have been noticeable to the unaided eye..The uranium series ought to end with lead atoms that had an atomic weight of 206..In 1912 Thomson was working on neon..Then, 98.9% of all carbon atoms (atomic symbol C) are ¹²C, but 1.1% are ¹³C..The neon atom has 10 electrons—2 in the innermost shell, and 8 in the next—and it does not react.		
By 1847 he was convinced that any form of energy could be turned into fixed and predictable amounts of heat; that a certain amount of work was equivalent to a certain amount of heat..In 1916 the American chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis (18751946) carried this notion farther..In the combined presence of a magnet and of an electric field, the neon ions move in a curved path..It is not surprising that the atomic weights of nitrogen and carbon are just about 14 and 12, respectively..The energy released by the uranium over a very long time grew to be enormous.		
The atomic number increases as one goes up the line of atoms..[Illustration: W..It quickly turned out that the atomic number was more fundamental and more characteristic of a particular element than was the atomic weight..In 1891, though, the Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney (18261911) suggested that the supposed unit of electricity be given a name at least..By 1885, however, the English physicist William Crookes (18321919) showed that cathode rays could be made to turn a small wheel when they struck that wheel on one side.		
There were the atoms, which made up ordinary matter, and the electrons, which made up electric current..It is for that reason that a great deal of energy (mostly in the form of heat) is given off if a jet of hydrogen gas and a jet of oxygen gas are allowed to mix in such a way as to form water..It starts at one pole of a battery, or of some other electricity generating device, and ends at the other..[Illustration: Niels Bohr] [Illustration: Bohr’s study.] Since Dalton’s time it had been assumed that all the atoms of a particular element were of equal atomic weight and that atoms of two different elements were always of different atomic weight..The third was soon called gamma rays” after the third letter.		
The early investigators quickly found that the breakdown of uranium238, for instance, could not be hastened by heat, pressure, changes in chemical combination, or, indeed, anything else they could think of..If something like the Thomson view were correct then the number of electrons, each with one unit of negative electricity, would depend on the total size of the positive charge carried by the atom..The rate of radioactive changes, however, could not apparently be altered..The uranium atom would give off 2,000,000 times as much energy in breaking down, as the carbon atom would in combining..None could either be destroyed or created.		
Uranium X₁, had, however, radioactive properties different from ordinary thorium..The sun gave the appearance of being a huge globe of fire..Here, then, is the meeting point of electrons and of atoms—the particles of electricity and of matter..By 1945, all seven had been discovered..The molecules of hydrogen and oxygen must be separated and that takes a little energy.		
In fact, each different type of atom seemed associated with reflected X rays of a particular penetrating power, so Barkla called these characteristic X rays”..To their surprise, protons were knocked out of the paraffin..But by Einstein’s equation all that energy is equivalent to only a little over a millionth of a gram..Chadwick managed to work out the mass of the neutron from his experiments and by 1934 it was quite clear that the neutron was more massive than the proton..The German physicist Walther Wilhelm Georg Bothe (18911957) and a coworker, H. Becker, were bombarding the light metal, beryllium, with alpha particles.		
This hydrogen nucleus had a single positive charge, one that was exactly equal in size to the negative charge on the electron..However, Aston and his mass spectrometer kept measuring the mass of different nuclei more and more closely during the 1920s and found that they differed very slightly from whole numbers..There was one way of getting around this and this was explained in 1935 by the American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (19041967) and by his student Melba Phillips..This instrument was called a cyclotron”..On the other hand, suppose you have lithium7, which was thought to be made up of 7 protons and 4 electrons.		
[Illustration: C..The protonneutron theory was therefore accepted and remains accepted to this day..In the end, if enough energy is gained, the proton could do more damage than the alpha particle, despite the former’s smaller mass..The fact that the neutron was just about as massive as the proton was to be expected if the neutron were a protonelectron combination..The protonelectron theory was only a theory.		
The result was to combine part of the alpha particle with the aluminum27 nucleus to form a new nucleus with an atomic number two units higher—15—and a mass number three units higher—30..Suppose we consider the neutrons as protonelectron combinations..Twelve separate protons would have a total mass of twelve times that, or 12.0939..The loss of mass in radioactive changes was found to match the production of energy in just the way Einstein predicted..[Illustration: J.		
The manner of radioactive breakdown fits the theory, too..For more complicated nuclei, additional neutrons are needed..New nuclei were produced that had more energy than the starting nuclei, so that energy was absorbed by the nuclear reaction rather than given off..All the spins would cancel each other..This was in accordance with observation.		
Nevertheless, that enormous energy change in the radioactive breakdown represented only about onehalf of 1% of the total energy to which the mass of the uranium atom was equivalent..The smallest nucleus found was that produced by knocking the single electron off a hydrogen atom in one way or another..The droplets, the bubbles, and the light can all be detected one way or another and the path of the subatomic particle could be followed by the trail of ions it left behind..[Illustration: Walther W. G. Bothe] To try to determine something about the properties of this radiation, Bothe and Becker tried putting objects in the way of the radiation..Since this mass is intermediate between that of an electron and proton, such particles eventually came to be called mesons” from a Greek word meaning intermediate”.		
Indeed, the surprise was that radioactive changes gave off as little energy as they did..For instance, suppose the helium nucleus is made up of 4 protons and 2 electrons, as was thought in the 1920s..And until it was found, the protonelectron theory of nuclear structure, whatever its obvious deficiencies with respect to nuclear spin, remained the only one to work with..This was the first time in history that the atomic nucleus was altered by deliberate human act..Subatomic particles could be detected in a variety of ways, but every single way (right down to the present time) makes use of their electric charge.		
In that case the nuclear spin would be 3, either in one direction or the other..To get hydrogensparkling out of the bombardment of nitrogen, Rutherford felt, he must have knocked protons out of the nitrogen nuclei..It is for this reason that gravitational and electromagnetic interactions can make themselves felt over millions of miles of space..In 1924 the Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli (19001958) worked out a theory that treated protons and electrons as though they were spinning on their axes..In ordinary bodies, the attractions and repulsions usually cancel each other entirely or nearly entirely, leaving very little of one or the other to be detected as surplus.		
Measured in terms of this natural unit of spin, the proton and the electron have spin ½..If it were made up of 4 protons, it ought to have an electric charge of +4..[Illustration: Werner Heisenberg] The protonneutron theory of nuclear structure could account for isotopes perfectly well, too..Suppose a beta particle is emitted..Yet a fixed number of protons turned out to have different masses if they were first considered separately and then as part of a nucleus.		
D. Anderson] In 1947, however, the English physicist Cecil Frank Powell (19031969) and his coworkers, also studying cosmicparticle bombardment, located another intermediatesized body, which had the right mass and all the other appropriate properties to fit Yukawa’s theories..What happens to this difference of 0.007825 between the proton in isolation and the proton as part of a carbon12 nucleus?.The nuclei that serve as their targets are so unimaginably small that most of the bombarding particles are sure to miss..The more massive nuclei are all radioactive..There are now, at this time of writing, proton synchrotrons” (descendants of that first cyclotron) that produce particles with over a million times the energy of those produced by Lawrence’s first cyclotron.		
Ordinary chemical reactions, with the electron shifts that accompany them, involve the electromagnetic interaction only..Using modern standards, the mass of a proton is 1.007825..That nucleus, often called a deuteron”, is made up of 1 proton plus 1 neutron and has a mass number of 2 and an atomic number of 1..Their device, called an electrostatic accelerator”, produced protons that were sufficiently energetic to initiate nuclear reactions..Was it possible that an electron and a proton, forced into the close confinement of the atomic nucleus might, by the force of mutual attraction, become so intimately connected as to count as a single particle.		
Of the 4 protons, suppose that two had a spin of +½ and two of ½..Suppose also that of the 2 electrons, one had a spin of +½ and one of ½..By the time you have gigantic masses such as the earth or the sun, the gravitational interaction between them and other bodies is also gigantic..Within many nuclei, the neutrons are quite stable and do not break up as they do in isolation..In that case, protons in virtual contact, as within the nucleus, would attract each other, but if the distance between them was increased sufficiently to place one outside the nucleus, the nuclear interaction would decrease in intensity to less than the electromagnetic repulsion.		
Neutron Bombardment As soon as neutrons were discovered, it seemed to physicists that they had another possible bombarding particle of extraordinary properties..In 1911 the Austrian physicist Victor Francis Hess (18831964) had discovered that earth was bombarded from every side by cosmic rays”..[Illustration: ENERGY CREATED compared to MATTER (OR MASS) DESTROYED] It is this vast difference between the tiny quantity of mass and the huge amount of energy to which it is equivalent that obscured the relationship over the years..These charged particles had to be energetic to overcome the repulsion of the nucleus and to smash into it with enough force to break it up..For more and more massive nuclei, the positive charge grew higher and the repulsion stronger until for elements beyond potassium, no collision could be forced, even with the most energetic naturally occurring alpha particles.		
No temperatures available to the physicists of the 1920s could force atoms to smash together hard enough to reach and shake the nucleus..It seemed reasonable, then, to suppose that a nucleus would contain about half as many electrons in addition to the protons..More and more electrons seemed to be required. Finally, when the total number of protons was 84 or more, no amount of electrons seemed sufficient to stabilize the nucleus..In either case, electrons are knocked off atoms that are encountered by the speeding subatomic particle..It was, in fact, by such an experiment that he first demonstrated the existence of such nuclei.		
[Illustration: Hideki Yukawa] [Illustration: Victor F. Hess] [Illustration: C..This came about first in 1934, when a French husbandandwife team of physicists, Frédéric JoliotCurie (19001958) and Irène JoliotCurie (18971956) were bombarding aluminum27 (atomic number 13) with alpha particles..The massenergy equivalence fully explained why the atom should contain so great a store of energy..Since it has a unit positive charge, it can be accelerated just as an isolated proton can be..Until the discovery of the neutron, only two kinds of forces, or interactions”, were known in the universe.		
However, among the objects they placed in the path of the new radiation, they included paraffin, which is made up of the light atoms of carbon and hydrogen..A neutron has a spin of ½ while a protonelectron combination would have a spin of either 0 or 1..The nuclear spin of the common isotope, nitrogen14, was measured accurately over and over again and turned out to be 1..In a rough way, one could tell the kind of nucleus that struck from the nature of the sparkling..Protons in Nuclei Let us, nevertheless, go on to describe some of the progress made in the 1920s in terms of the protonelectron theory that was then accepted.
