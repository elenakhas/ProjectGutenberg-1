She does not boast of her mastery of nature, but to her she brings, with infinite care and joy, her offerings of love..Life based upon science is attractive to some men, because it has all the characteristics of sport; it feigns seriousness, but is not profound..The reaction of disillusionment is just as unreal as the first shock of illusion..It is civilisation of human relationship..This experience of your soul, in meeting a personality in the heart of the world, has been embodied in your civilisation.		
This dragon did not belong to the mythology of the past, but of the present; and with its iron mask it tried to look real to the children of the age,real as the majestic rocks on the shore, as the epic rhythm of the seawaves..And the true expression of this love is in the language of beauty, which is so abundantly universal in this land..It is science, but not its wrong application in life,a mere imitation of our science teachers who reduce it into a superstition absurdly invoking its aid for all impossible purposes..We know that, in the early stage of man's moral immaturity, he only feels reverence for the god whose malevolence he dreads..And it has come to pass, that the children of those heroes, who would keep their word at the point of death, who would disdain to cheat men for vulgar profit, who even in their fight would much rather court defeat than be dishonourable, have become energetic in dealing with falsehoods and do not feel humiliated by gaining advantage from them.		
A mere knowledge of things can be had in a short enough time, but their spirit can only be acquired by centuries of training and selfcontrol..The genius of Europe has given her people the power of organisation, which has specially made itself manifest in politics and commerce and in coordinating scientific knowledge..In other great countries, signs of man's power loomed large, and I saw vast organisations which showed efficiency in all their features..They are loud in their boast, that they have modernised Japan..But, in Japan, it is not the display of power, or wealth, that is the predominating element.		
Such a civilisation has the gift of immortality; for it does not offend against the laws of creation and is not assailed by all the forces of nature..What is still more dangerous for Japan is, not this imitation of the outer features of the West, but the acceptance of the motive force of the Western civilisation as her own..This is the reason why a stranger, like myself, instead of feeling envy or humiliation before these manifestations of beauty, these creations of love, feels a readiness to participate in the joy and glory of such revealment of the human heart..I feel it is an impiety to be indifferent to its protection from the incursion of vulgarity of power..Where man is at his greatest, he is unconscious.		
Therefore I am afraid of the rude pressure of the political ideals of the West upon your own..In past ages we had foreign invasions, there had been cruelty and bloodshed, intrigues of jealousy and avarice, but they never touched the soul of the people deeply; for the people, as a body, never participated in these games..This spiritual bond of love she has established with the hills of her country, with the sea and the streams, with the forests in all their flowery moods and varied physiognomy of branches; she has taken into her heart all the rustling whispers and sighing of the woodlands and sobbing of the waves; the sun and the moon she has studied in all the modulations of their lights and shades, and she is glad to close her shops to greet the seasons in her orchards and gardens and cornfields..But the tidal wave of falsehood has swept over your land from that part of the world, where business is business, and honesty is followed in it merely as the best policy..She has achieved something, which is positive and complete.		
One must bear in mind, that those who have the true modern spirit need not modernise, just as those who are truly brave are not braggarts..We must not vitiate our children's minds with the superstition, that business is business, war is war, politics is politics..It pursues success with skill and thoroughness, and takes no account of the higher nature of man..I have felt that you have been able to assimilate these secrets into your life, and the truth which lies in the beauty of all things has passed into your souls..In political civilisation, the state is an abstraction and relationship of men utilitarian.		
Therefore I cannot think that the imitation of the outward aspects of the West, which is becoming more and more evident in modern Japan, is essential to her strength or stability..The divine in her heart is suffering from the injuries inflicted by her hands upon the world,and from this pain of her higher nature flows the secret balm which will bring healing to those injuries..Europe is not ready to give up her political inhumanity, with all the baser passions of man attendant upon it; she believes only in modification of systems, and not in change of heart..Therefore its rivalry to things that are modest and profound and have the subtle delicacy of life is to be dreaded..Science speaks of the struggle for existence, but forgets that man's existence is not merely of the surface.		
It is easy to be unfair in one's judgment when one is faced with human miseries,and pessimism is the result of building theories while the mind is suffering..For man's struggle for existence is to exist in the fullness of his nature,not by curtailing all that is best in him and dwarfing his existence itself, but by accepting all the responsibilities of his spiritual life, even through death and defeat..But while trying to free our minds from the arrogant claims of Europe and to help ourselves out of the quicksands of our infatuation, we may go to the other extreme and blind ourselves with a wholesale suspicion of the West..When Japan is in imminent peril of neglecting to realise where she is great, it is the duty of a foreigner like myself to remind her, that she has given rise to a civilisation which is perfect in its form, and has evolved a sense of sight which clearly sees truth in beauty and beauty in truth..It would be altogether unjust, both to us and to Europe, to say that she has fascinated the modern Eastern mind by the mere exhibition of her power.		
And the time has come, when you have to be roused into full consciousness of the truth by which you live, so that you may not be taken unawares..This opening of the heart to the soul of the world is not confined to a section of your privileged classes, it is not the forced product of exotic culture, but it belongs to all your men and women of all conditions..Its harsh obtrusiveness makes it forcibly visible to us, overcoming our senses,and we bring to its altar sacrifices, as does a savage to the fetish which appears powerful because of its hideousness..The ideal of "maitri" is at the bottom of your culture,"maitri" with men and "maitri" with Nature..It is really because we are afraid of our own weakness, which allows itself to be overcome by the sight of power, that we try to substitute for it another weakness which makes itself blind to the glories of the West.		
After centuries of civilisation nations fearing each other like the prowling wild beasts of the night time; shutting their doors of hospitality; combining only for purpose of aggression or defence; hiding in their holes their trade secrets, state secrets, secrets of their armaments; making peace offerings to the barking dogs of each other with the meat which does not belong to them; holding down fallen races struggling to stand upon their feet; counting their safety only upon the feebleness of the rest of humanity; with their right hands dispensing religion to weaker peoples, while robbing them with their left,is there anything in this to make us envious?.You have known her language of lines and music of colours, the symmetry in her irregularities, and the cadence in her freedom of movements; you have seen how she leads her immense crowds of things yet avoids all frictions; how the very conflicts in her creations break out in dance and music; how her exuberance has the aspect of the fullness of selfabandonment, and not a mere dissipation of display..They brought their basket of fruits to me and held their lighted incense before my face, wishing to pay homage to a man who had come from the land of Buddha..Therefore they are in harmony with life's growth, or else when the time comes they easily give way and are forgotten..Things that are living are so easily hurt; therefore they require protection.		
And this has been effected by the charm of the word 'modern.'.While travelling in a railway train I met, at a wayside station, some Buddhist priests and devotees..They were merely the outcome of individual ambitions..Your race has shown that genius, not by acquirements, but by creations; not by display of things, but by manifestation of its own inner being..But is this the ideal of man which we can look up to with pride?		
Are we to bend our knees to the spirit of this civilisation, which is sowing broadcast over all the world seeds of fear, greed, suspicion, unashamed lies of its diplomacy, and unctuous lies of its profession of peace and goodwill and universal brotherhood of Man?.I do not for a moment suggest, that Japan should be unmindful of acquiring modern weapons of selfprotection..Your national unity has not been evolved from the comradeship of arms for defensive and offensive purposes, or from partnership in raiding adventures, dividing among each member the danger and spoils of robbery..Is the instinct of the West right, where she builds her national welfare behind the barricade of a universal distrust of humanity?".But if undiluted utility be modern, beauty is of all ages; if mean selfishness be modern, the human ideals are no new inventions.		
There are races, who worship the animals they kill; we can buy meat from them, when we are hungry, but not the worship which goes with the killing..But, unfortunately, all his armour is not living,some of it is made of steel, inert and mechanical..Never think for a moment, that the hurts you inflict upon other races will not infect you, and the enmities you sow around your homes will be a wall of protection to you for all time to come..If he is weak enough to grow smaller to fit himself to his covering, then it becomes a process of gradual suicide by shrinkage of the soul..So the questions you have to put to yourselves are these,"Have we read the world wrong, and based our relation to it upon an ignorance of human nature?		
But a mere political relationship is all conscious; it is an eruptive inflammation of aggressiveness..There, display and extravagance, in dress, in furniture, in costly entertainments, are startling..Her relationship with the world is the deeper relationship of heart..Japan must be reminded, that it is her sense of the rhythm of life and of all things, her genius for simplicity, her love for cleanliness, her definiteness of thought and action, her cheerful fortitude, her immense reserve of force in selfcontrol, her sensitiveness to her code of honour and defiance of death, which have given her the power to resist the cyclonic storm of exploitation that has sprung from the shores of Europe circling round and round the world..It is discrediting the ideals, which were born of the lives of men, who were our greatest and best.		
You have known that energies of nature save themselves from wearing out by the rhythm of a perfect grace, and that she with the tenderness of her curved lines takes away fatigue from the world's muscles..Therefore she is ever ready for fight, and the best portion of her attention is occupied in organising forces..Therefore the ideals, whose seats were in the hearts of the people, would not undergo any serious change owing to the policies adopted by the kings or generals..It is not an outcome of the necessity of organisation for some ulterior purpose, but it is an extension of the family and the obligations of the heart in a wide field of space and time..The past has been God's gift to you; about the present, you must make your own choice.		
But this should never be allowed to go beyond her instinct of selfpreservation..I am quite sure that there are men in your nation, who are not in sympathy with your national ideals; whose object is to gain, and not to grow..And this is a point on which we in the East have to acknowledge our guilt and own that our sin has been as great, if not greater, when we insulted humanity by treating with utter disdain and cruelty men who belonged to a particular creed, colour or caste..On my first arrival in this country, when I looked out from the balcony of a house on the hillside, the town of Kobe,that huge mass of corrugated iron roofs,appeared to me like a dragon, with glistening scales, basking in the sun, after having devoured a large slice of the living flesh of the earth..For the rhythm of beauty is the inner spirit, whose outer body is organisation.		
The moral law, which is the greatest discovery of man, is the discovery of this wonderful truth, that man becomes all the truer, the more he realises himself in others..Your duty towards your state has naturally assumed the character of filial duty, your nation becoming one family with your Emperor as its head..Our food crops, which are necessary for our sustenance, are products of centuries of selection and care..Close by on a mudflat stood a large Kadamba tree in full flower..Wherever are you going, alone and in this guise?"		
Now, if Phatik was to keep his regal dignity before the public, it was clear he ought to carry out his threat..Before going he placed his hand on my head, and kept it there for some time..The aunt said there was no need for her to go alone, for she was going away also..I cannot tell you with what joy and shame I heard it..But now a servant came down from the house, and told Phatik his mother wanted him.		
We will perform all funeral honours.".There was no more backward boy in the whole school than Phatik..But I am sure you know what has happened..But my husband has left the cool shade of those things that are ageless and unfading..And when the rain came beating down, and the clouds covered the sky, he would sit on the threshold facing the sea, and say to his sorrowing mother: "Tell me, mother, a story of some very faroff land."		
I knew how keen his powers of observation were, and what a hard judge he was..But the new Goddess, who had taken her new throne in me, said: "The time might come when it would be good for your husband to break his oath and marry again.".When I found that the water in my eyes was still increasing, I would console myself with the thought that it was a good thing to get rid of so much bad fluid; and, when the flow of water in my eyes decreased, I was elated at my husband's skill..I remember vividly that evening in Calcutta when the fairy story began..Exactly to the minute, in the bend of the lane, I saw his approaching umbrella.		
Ah, yes!."Is it necessary?".IV Our two lives went on with their dull routine for some time..That sweet ringing laughter of hers swept away in a moment all the dark clouds that stood between us.."That will never do.		
said Nabendu loftily..The friends who met him in the street were perforce ready to be buttonholed, while a long string of questions of this kind followed one another from his lips: "My dear friend, I am delighted to see you..But today we are expected to write pages of facts, while the truth is simply this: "There was a king."."That you have certainly made a mistake.".The Goddess, who was within me, answered: "That is no reason why you should exult over it."		
But Sripati, who readily agreed to anything Jogmaya said, cut short her story, and left his wife uneasy in her mind..Why have you come to deceive him?.He spread upon his bed the white flowers that he loved, the jasmines, tuberoses and chrysanthemums, and brought into his bedroom all the lamps he had in his house and lighted them..Anukul's conscience was worse stricken than ever, when Raicharan tried to put the blame on God's shoulders..When she saw my uproarious laughter she stood upright in passion, flashing the lightning of her big dark eyes in mine, and said with a tearchoked voice: "Tell me!		
"You are ruining Kumo's eyes..Indeed I became an expert in selfdelusion..They were the footsteps of my husband..I coughed, and tried to hide my emotion, but he burst out saying: "Kumo, I know I am a fool, and a braggart, and all that, but I am not a villain!.He is fast disappearing into the barren, waterless waste in his mad thirst for gold.		
When my boy was with me, I had left him alone..Then came the rainy season, and day after day the rain poured down in torrents.."Our merciful God," she replied, "beats us with His own hand, and drives away all the poison..But there is a mischief in money..And then she held my hand and said: "What do you think, dear?"		
By dying, Kadambini had given proof that she was not dead..Nor do they regard me as ascetic, because the little acquaintance they have of me carries the savour of comfort about it..Even if the girl remained unmarried, he would not break the family tradition..I could not detect it; but it was detected by the God of my heart..Do you know, he was terribly hurt because you hadn't called.		
So feeble was its support!.I will tell you some other day.".My deception had the effect of bringing about a better feeling between my husband and Dada..He would forget things, and his mind became dull and stupid..One of these two left me, and I left the other.		
Kadambini stood in the room..It was not I who did it..In anguished tones she said: "Sister, why do you dread me?.One after another all had died..Occasionally there had been quarrels between them, as was only right, since Kadambini wished to make it dear that her love for Jogmaya was unbounded, while her friend complained that Kadambini did not return a love equal to her own.		
there are heaps of them," replied his aunt..I want a womanjust an ordinary womanwhom I can be free to chide and coax and pet and scold.".At once the boy was called, and the marriage garlands were exchanged between him and the princess..I was quite unprepared for this abrupt request, and answered her on the spur of the moment: "Good words I neither give nor receive..Jogmaya asked: "Well?"		
One morning Nabendu was sipping his tea, and glancing at a newspaper..And the Nines would become their hopeless and abject slaves..I showed that veneration, and had peace..From that day forward, merely over this trifling matter of my eyes, the bond between my husband and Dada was strained.."I stopped, lowering my eyes, shrinking into myself.		
One evening, however, when the autumn moon was flooding the earth with its mischievous beams, Nabendu's heart was so full that he could not contain himself any longer, and he told his wife..So Sripati went, and Jogmaya on her part said to Kadambini "Friend, it hardly seems proper for you to stop here any longer..While they were quarrelling, I was saying to myself that it was always the poor grass that suffered most when two kings went to war..On the return journey, a European Sergeant of the Police expelled some Indian gentlemen from a railwaycarriage with great insolence..Have you heard?		
Thou art with me.".He brought with him letters of introduction from many distinguished Englishmen at home, and these gave him some recognition in AngloIndian society.."Oh!.He was wet through from head to foot, muddy all over, his face and eyes flushed red with fever, and his limbs all trembling..Yet this Pramathanath had once sojourned in England for some three years.		
His sight was dim and blurred.."Please take this from me," said I, "for your little granddaughter, and get a trustworthy doctor to look after her..What am I else but that,just an ordinary woman?.The place was new to me, but the scents and sounds of the countryside pressed round and embraced me..Ah!		
You've been to the wrong house, or are confused as to what you have heard..So now the money is mine."."Yes," my husband replied..Her rivers and oceans send up vapours in which she is clothed..The chances are she will now advance a step, and then retreat a step.		
For my sake, dear, do get away to Calcutta..I have long been nursing a plan which, if only I could carry it out, would set fire to the whole country..It will do splendidly.."We can be staunch in our own convictions," I said, "but we have no control over those of others..Let us first fill our country's coffers with stolen goods and then take centuries, like these other countries, to answer for them, if we must.		
And how can I have the power to refuse to take the money?.I made no reply, but though I was looking another way, I could not help feeling that Sandip's plaintive gaze had planted itself right on my face, and would take no denial..Keeping them and accumulating them alike are false..I had a constant feeling that something extraordinary might happen any moment, for which, however, the responsibility would not be mine..We men, with our ideas, strive to give it a particular shape by melting it into a particular mouldinto the definiteness of success.		
That of the deity in our country who is becoming manifest..While Panchu was thus engaged, the full shock of the Swadeshi flood fell on him..With the confidence begotten of these proofs of my power, I was ready to meet my husband like a lightningcharged cloud..This is not the time to drain the cup to the dregs..This is the reason why I am ready to suffer all, knowing all, with eyes open."		
My arm was raised to do it, but a sudden pang passed through my breast, tears started to my eyes..I followed her in, and taking a chair fanned myself with a fan which was on the table..I don't care if they all go, but I must have that six thousand without fail."."That is not all," my master went on..They are certain that either I have a longing for some title, or else that I am afraid of the police.		
He stood straight up as he replied: "I had set my heart, Sister Rani, on returning your jewels to you with my own hand..I gently lifted Bimala back into her chair, and lest reaction should set in, I began again without losing time: "Queen!.How terribly alone is he, who misses companionship in the midst of the multitudinousness of life..Can you not do it, dear?".I should have been so relieved if his anger had flashed out!		
I cannot find it in my heart to change them, for they seem longing to fulfil their destiny of adorning the neck of Beauty..Faith deceives men, but it has one great merit: it imparts a radiance to the features..What was to be done next?.You are not called upon to make out a case against Harish Kundu, or anybody else.".With a shout of Bande Mataram they left us.		
"I have had words with Nikhil about it," said Sandip..I must go..But Sandip Babu would have it that we must give up even our shame for the country..For aught I know, this frenzy of mine might have come to a gradual, natural end.."No, I have not yet had the time to get it away," my husband replied.		
I came back into the bedroom where my husband was asleep, closing my eyes as I passed through, and went off to the open terrace beyond, on which I lay prone, clasping to my breast the end of the sari tied over the gold..Panchu began to buy cloth at the market and peddle it about the village..As it is, every moment of theirs is a lifeanddeath struggle for a bare living; you cannot even imagine the difference a few pice means to themso little have you in common..Do not mistake me for one of the crowd..Thus we came to cherish the belief that our history needed no steed, but that like heaven's chariot it would move with its own inherent powerAt least no wages would have to be paid to the charioteer; only his wine cup would have to be filled again and again.		
Amulya and I left the room together.."What do you want with it, sister?".Oh why has God made man such a mixed creature?.These are the offerings of my worship to ward the dust off the feet of my wakeful divinity.".Men have a perpetual longing to bring out this Shakti from the hidden depths of their own nature, and those of us who succeed in doing so at once clearly understand the meaning of the music coming to us from the Dark.		
's and M.A..I covered my eyes with the end of my sari, which I pressed to my face with both my hands, and sobbed and sobbed..I asked..He begged and prayed Harish Kundu, his zamindar, to let him sell off his stock, bought with borrowed money, promising faithfully never to do it again; but the zamindar would not hear of it, and insisted on his burning the foreign stuff there and then, if he wanted to be let off..You may of course stay in my house thereto that there is no objection."		
"No, Amulya," I said, "we have not quite finished.".It remains to be seen how high their gushing fountain will play, and for how long..I was then wrapped in the protecting armour of the exaltation of sacrifice, through which such shafts were powerless to reach and shame me..Sandip Babu cried out: "See, Nikhil, how in the heart of a woman Truth takes flesh and blood..But my intoxication today is still more fearful.		
IX When I was about to enter the sittingroom, I saw Sandip immersed in an illustrated catalogue of British Academy pictures, with his back to the door.."Where, then, is this wonderful soul?".If the cow alone is to be held sacred from slaughter, and not the buffalo, then that is bigotry, not religion.".Indeed you have already done so..What I should like to be able to tell Nikhil frankly is, that happenings such as these must be looked in the faceas great Realitiesand that which is the Truth should not be allowed to stand between true friends.		
"Then go back to your mother, Amulya.".Am I not born to rule?to bestride my proper steed, the crowd, and drive it as I will; the reins in my hand, the destination known only to me, and for it the thorns, the mire, on the road?."Is there any country, sir," pursued the history student, "where submission to Government is not due to fear?"."I have never yet found any one source of inspiration suffice me for good..All duties have become as shadows: all rules and restraints have snapped their bonds.		
So they were continually bickering..XIII What is this?.Once I thought I should turn back..Then whom shall I blame?.But I could find nothing in him which I could touch.		
Anyhow, the raid of the dacoits was over; now the police raid would begin..Ashamed?.Another day my master came to me and said: "Why don't you two go up to Darjeeling for a change?.Man is infinitely more than the natural science of himself..I never had the trial.
