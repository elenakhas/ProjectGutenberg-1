nobody	appeared	to	have	a	word	for	her	though	there	was	an	exceptional	disposition	to	gossip		
he	had	his	handicap	in	life	but	soon	gave	proof	that	if	he	was	a	bradshaw	it	was	an	accident	which	other	people	would	be	wise	to	forget	fighting	his	way	from	the	status	of	a	butt	till	he	was	cock	of	the	walk	amongst	the	halftimers		
i	’m	nobbut	looking	back	to	the	times	that	used	to	be		
this	is	where	disbelief	has	brought	you		
others	clockless	got	up	long	before	they	needed	and	waited	in	the	chill	of	early	morning	at	five	o’clock	for	the	door	to	open		
goodnight	chapter	viithe	early	life	of	john	bradshaw	once	upon	a	time	a	west	indian	slave	owner	was	in	conversation	with	three	masterspinners	and	they	spoke	of	labor	conditions	in	the	north	of	england		
but	it	is	n’t	the	case	that	you	decide	rupert		
it	’s	so	long	sin’	we	’ve	seen	thee	he	said		
but	intimately	he	would	have	his	incomparable	gain	the	matchless	joy	of	the	creative	artist	working	on	apt	material		
you	’re	stunning	he	said	at	sight	of	her	stupidly	and	truthfully	missing	the	finer	excellences	of	her	frock	disconcerted	by	it	simply	because	it	was	a	frock		
it	’s	mine		
he	reached	for	his	hat		
that	portrait	is	of	william	edward	’s	son		
it	was	unfortunate	that	mrs.	verners	clucked	over	him	like	a	hen	who	has	found	a	longlost	chicken		
she	saw	her	expedition	turning	in	its	first	engagement	to	triumphant	victory	but	she	wanted	the	spoils	of	victory	she	wanted	a	spade	to	be	called	unmistakably	a	spade	she	wanted	his	declaration	in	round	terms	before	he	left	that	room		
he	was	a	worker	in	research	he	was	scientifically	unemotional	about	the	motive	of	his	research	but	he	was	on	fertile	ground	here	and	if	he	drew	blank	at	staithley	eisteddfod	then	lancashire	was	not	the	county	he	took	it	for		
you	’ve	got	no	sense	of	humor	he	said		
they	were	not	formal	tributes	they	were	chatty	reminiscences	hitting	rupert	the	shrewder	because	there	was	nothing	conventional	about	them	bringing	home	to	the	son	how	his	father	had	seemed	to	other	eyes	than	his		
they	have	n’t	told	you		
us	had	a	hoamcoming	ready	for	thee	arter	the	war	but	tha’	didno	come	no	sirring	and	no	obsequiousness	from	this	old	servant	of	the	firm	and	rupert	gave	a	quick	resentful	glance	as	he	pulled	the	car	up	in	the	yard		
indeed	indeed	she	would	rejoice	with	him		
but	i	will	do	my	duty	it	would	certainly	not	have	occurred	to	william	in	the	first	days	of	the	war	to	convert	their	dyehouse	from	cotton	dyeing	to	woolen	that	sort	of	march	into	foreign	territory	so	extraordinarily	lucrative	would	have	occurred	to	none	but	to	sir	philip	and	they	understood	very	well	that	under	william	or	under	any	of	them	now	the	control	would	be	prudent	and	uninspired		
still	there	is	a	thing	which	puzzles	me	he	said		
he	became	expert	in	its	politics	and	its	gossip		
oh	do	with	me	what	you	like		
technique	could	be	acquired	and	mr.	chown	did	not	condemn	technique	but	x	was	and	it	was	not	possible	to	acquire	it		
are	things	as	queer	as	they	say	what	do	they	say	asked	luke		
reuben	never	forgot	that	he	belonged	to	the	old	order	was	of	it	and	had	married	into	it		
could	n’t	you	hear	her	i	heard	a	streetsinger	you	heard	a	class	voice	and	you	’re	going	to	hear	it	again	mr.		
he	might	have	been	conscious	that	dorothy	had	suddenly	got	up	and	thrown	the	curtains	back	from	the	window	and	had	opened	it	and	stood	there	now	as	if	she	needed	air		
she	remembered	that	he	had	spoken	of	sir	ralph	as	a	profiteer	but	had	admitted	that	most	of	their	friends	were	profiteers		
some	crowded	hours	had	passed	when	the	memorialist	at	the	table	’s	head	unsteadily	picked	up	a	glass	and	saying	mechanically	a	glass	of	wine	with	you	sir	found	himself	isolating	from	a	ruddy	haze	the	flushed	face	of	mr.	verners		
i	’ll	break	your	neck	tom	tom	protested	walter		
does	he	said	mary	listlessly		
i	doubt	whether	a	factory	controlled	by	a	strong	hand	has	anything	to	fear	from	workmen	’s	combinations	damn	it	look	at	blackburn	you	shall	have	my	decision	when	it	is	ready		
not	yet	he	said		
we	leadnot	exclusively	but	we	are	of	the	leadersin	lancashire		
in	the	heat	of	argument	she	had	felt	confident	of	her	weapon	and	now	she	doubted	if	it	were	a	weapon	or	hers	to	use		
i	’ve	no	reply	to	that	he	said		
i	am	trying	to	be	just	just	and	believe	me	trying	not	to	be	smug		
you	’ll	be	sansgêne	in	the	duchess	of	dantzig.’	i	did	n’t	tell	you	i	’m	retiring	from	the	stage	did	i		
we	go	into	the	question	of	price	and	we	quote	the	figure	to	these	accountants		
think	it	over	old	man	he	said	earnestly		
go	back	to	the	hymn	he	said		
shooting		
but	there	is	tom	young	tom	verners	was	with	his	regiment	in	the	peninsula		
they	rarely	lived	to	see	forty		
i	want	to	see	you	urgently		
but	i	’m	not	doubting	it	what	we	can	do	at	any	rate	is	to	go	together	through	the	records	of	the	firm		
if	rupert	was	developing	anything	it	was	listlessness		
brickyards	mostly	she	said		
that	was	all	bare	decency	not	the	flaunting	parody	with	plumes	and	gin	of	the	slightly	less	poor	nor	were	there	many	mourners		
well	he	asked		
in	the	ranks	though		
darley	was	n’t	looking	at	the	stage	he	was	looking	at	the	audience	and	he	knew	triumph	when	he	saw	it		
he	tried	again	with	an	earnest	spinsterish	lady	who	looked	strongminded	enough	for	anything	and	the	girl	had	him	in	the	fraction	of	a	minute		
sir	philip	’s	widow	knew	if	mrs.	william	did	n’t	what	was	incumbent	on	a	hepplestall		
yesterday	he	was	in	hell	and	tomorrow	very	likely	he	would	swear	if	the	waiter	at	the	hotel	brought	up	tepid	tea	to	his	bedside	but	tonight	he	had	n’t	made	adjustments	tonight	he	was	impressible	by	amenity		
his	place	was	at	the	source	at	the	mills	a	standardbearer	of	the	cotton	trade	a	manufacturer	first	and	a	salesman	and	distributor	only	by	proxy		
it	is	n’t	yet	but	he	’s	in	danger	and	he	can	be	saved		
if	there	are	forms	to	go	through	refer	the	officials	to	me	in	the	factory	they	called	him	master	he	was	master	of	them	all		
come	on	the	stage	and	we	’ll	see	what	you	have	got		
harry	had	won	forgiveness	dorothy	decided	and	if	he	came	next	day	in	wooing	vein	it	was	n’t	she	who	would	check	his	ardor	a	second	time		
it	closes	the	account	no		
but	what	are	these	but	the	freaks	we	all	enjoy	in	london		
he	was	the	spring	wound	up	by	mr.	barraclough	now	he	had	acted	and	he	was	relaxed	he	was	relaxed	and	happy		
staithley	’s	the	one	place	that	’s	absolutely	barred	rupert	you	’re	making	me	responsible		
no		
you	are	one	of	the	right	people	but	there	is	work	before	you		
i	’m	nearer	earth	than	that	never	for	me	he	protested		
he	was	therefore	sparing	in	his	tutorship	when	they	had	come	into	his	room	and	handled	the	gun	together		
but	annie	’s	gypsy	strain	kept	her	immune	from	any	such	fears	her	ancestors	had	traded	in	superstition		
if	i	were	a	sculptor	seriously	rupert	i	’m	going	to	fight	this		
she	was	arousing	his	worst	she	was	reawakening	his	rebellion	to	the	thought	that	he	had	had	his	fling	she	was	tempting	him	to	continue	it	in	the	hope	that	when	his	fling	was	ended	mrs.	verners	would	have	mercifully	also	ended		
barraclough	had	given	him	a	goal	and	an	outlet	for	all	his	pentup	emotion		
she	knew	how	jacques	and	phoebe	though	they	only	met	when	this	tour	began	had	been	married	last	week	at		
electric	trams	bumped	up	the	inclines	through	sprawling	mainstreets	off	which	ran	the	rows	upon	uniform	rows	of	celllike	houses	backtoback	airless	bathless	insanitary	in	which	the	bulk	of	the	workers	lived		
she	exercised	fastidious	selectiveness	but	having	chosen	gave	her	company	at	costly	meals	to	young	officers	who	returned	to	france	swaggering	in	soul	mentioning	aloud	with	infinite	casualness	that	they	had	lunched	with	mary	arden		
tom	made	a	move		
i	did	n’t	think	they	’d	go	for	hepplestall	’s		
she	had	been	idealizing	harry	since	the	precious	token	came	and	he	camelike	this	lurching	thickvoiced	beastly		
aye	said	needham	aye	he	finished	the	bottle	since	nothing	more	substantial	was	forthcoming	and	rose	to	go		
as	a	captain	of	the	light	entertainment	industry	he	was	doing	exceedingly	well	out	of	the	war	he	had	a	high	opinion	of	the	colonial	soldiery	the	young	british	officer	was	hardly	behind	the	colonial	private	in	his	eagerness	to	occupy	mr.	rossiter	’s	stalls	and	at	times	when	leave	was	suspended	the	civilian	population	filled	the	breach	in	its	very	natural	desire	for	an	antidote	to	anxiety
