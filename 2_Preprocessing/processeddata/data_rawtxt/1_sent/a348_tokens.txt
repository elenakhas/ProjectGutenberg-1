even	her	frugality	her	love	of	order	and	cleanliness	and	the	readiness	with	which	she	could	speak	on	any	subject	and	ward	off	anything	that	irritated	her	pride	delighted	him		
one	angry	voice	towering	above	the	rest	shouted	mitry	nikolayitchdon't	you	throw	my	words	back	at	me		
is	it	thou	bold	madcap		
i	thought	you	wereonly	such	a	one	asand	you	areforgive	me	dear		
when	ilya	returned	to	the	house	of	petrusha	filimonov	he	discovered	with	pleasure	that	he	had	grown	considerably	during	the	time	he	had	spent	in	the	shop		
cried	lunev	angrily		
then	we	will	celebrate	out	misfortune		
here	one	must	reckon	in	a	special	way		
his	intimacy	with	olympiada	so	unexpectedly	begun	from	a	woman	's	whim	rendered	ilya	at	first	quite	arrogant		
every	now	and	then	a	whisper	was	audible		
be	still	my	friend	and	do	n't	complain	    	but	stuff	your	mouth	with	bread	again		
and	if	you	have	a	soul	how	did	it	get	inside	you		
ilya	he	shouted	come	and	look	here	on	the	floor	if	you	ca	n't	find	a	tenrouble	piece		
asked	ilya	thoughtfully		
he	hung	a	white	muslin	curtain	before	the	window		
cried	avtonomov	as	he	kissed	his	wife	and	she	laughed		
because	of	that		
i	'm	so	sorry	to	be	late	murmured	ilya		
oh	i	do	n't	know	for	whom	for	you	or	for	herself	it	's	all	the	same		
he	'll	understand	up	there		
what		
but	the	shopman	tore	it	out	of	his	hand	tweaked	his	nose	and	said	crossly	who	said	you	could	do	that	fool		
some	one	ran	against	him		
above	all	he	was	the	sworn	foe	of	all	little	girls	and	could	seldom	resist	the	temptation	to	pinch	them	or	push	them	or	pull	their	hair	and	generally	make	their	lives	a	burden		
his	shoulders	twitched	his	fingers	involuntarily	clenched	and	a	daring	boldness	awakened	in	his	heart	and	banished	his	fear		
she	looked	at	him	sighed	and	went	on	and	who	desires	much	from	him	also	much	shall	be	desired		
this	step	is	labelled	household	duties		
they	'll	have	you	out	or	else	you	yourself	will	give	it	up		
o	god		
tell	us		
why		
yes	said	ilya	defiantly		
why	do	you	never	come	to	see	us		
he	knows	that	i	'm	grown	up	and	can	look	after	myself	answered	masha		
he	went	about	halfclothed	and	barefoot	and	his	beloved	old	harmonica	was	always	under	his	arm		
she	's	two	children	not	three		
oh	yes		
but	gratschev	maintained	his	statement		
his	dirty	shirt	used	to	slip	up	on	to	his	hump	and	leave	his	naked	loins	visible		
was	his	thought		
and	then	jakov	starts	in	all	of	a	sudden	let	me	go	too	he	says		
he	used	not	to	pray	but	would	simply	stand	in	some	corner	and	look	without	any	definite	thought	at	the	worshipping	crowd	and	listen	to	the	singing	of	the	choir		
early	next	year	i	'm	done		
i	will	entertain	himshall	i		
the	lad	stayed	a	moment	before	answering	then	went	up	to	ilya	and	asked	looking	suspiciously	round	the	little	room	what	do	you	want		
he	felt	hot	and	sick	his	face	was	full	of	blood	his	eyes	were	strained	with	the	tenseness	of	their	gaze		
the	sound	of	this	conversation	seemed	to	send	new	strength	and	courage	streaming	through	him		
you	'll	pull	me	out	of	the	pit		
near	the	door	stood	a	dutch	stove	and	along	the	wall	with	its	head	against	the	stove	a	wide	bed	opposite	the	bed	a	table	and	two	chairs	a	third	chair	stood	in	front	of	the	window	that	appeared	as	a	dark	spot	in	the	grey	wall		
a	lamp	burned	on	the	bar	lighting	up	the	bulging	teapots	and	the	bottles	in	the	cupboards	against	the	wall		
stay	a	little		
while	mother	was	alive	he	did	not	drink	much		
what	can	you	say	against	it		
no	do	n't	think	that		
asked	ilya	sternly		
no	need	for	that	it	's	coming	down	in	bucketsful		
answered	kirik	lazily		
his	hands	moved	slackly	his	face	was	despairing	and	he	spoke	slowly	in	a	dull	voice		
that	's	to	say	you	bargained	with	him		
i	shall	give	up	the	police	altogether	and	start	as	agent	or	manager	in	a	big	business		
why		
forgive	me	brother	said	lunev	slowly	and	heavily	lowering	his	eyes		
ilya	had	an	unpleasant	feeling	as	though	something	were	crawling	over	his	face		
but	how	did	you	learn	things	there		
with	downcast	eyes	he	sat	on	his	bed	and	had	no	inclination	to	dress		
through	the	windows	came	the	sound	of	lively	appeals	and	applause	from	gromov	's	house		
ilya	disliked	the	silence		
he	was	ashamed	now	of	his	anxiety	and	the	precaution	of	the	scrap	of	down	seemed	foolish	and	ridiculous		
ilya	looked	at	her	and	again	felt	a	painful	discomfort	but	almost	immediately	the	sensation	vanished	under	the	influence	of	new	impressions	and	cares		
goodday		
see	what	a	life		
silly	boy		
he	said	to	me	as	the	chisel	needs	the	stone	to	gain	its	sharpness	so	man	heeds	sin	to	wear	away	his	soul	and	bring	it	to	the	dust	at	the	feet	of	allmerciful	god		
terenti	looked	hard	at	him	sighed	and	said	nothing	jakov	met	him	in	masha	's	room	and	said	with	a	terrified	face	last	night	the	ward	superintendent	was	here	he	asked	father	all	about	you		
i	'm	with	you	vassili	is	in	siberia	in	a	telegraph	office	sonyka	gives	lessons		
it	's	hot		
ca	n't	you	really	give	up	brandy		
his	thoughts	flew	far	away	from	his	own	sins		
jakov	looked	once	like	an	anxious	nurse	at	masha	and	turned	the	lamp	down		
quick	be	quick		
a	proud	selfconfident	feeling	awakened	in	him	healing	the	little	wounds	that	life	had	dealt	his	heart		
his	wife	said	ilya		
i	do	n't	understand	god	help	you		
the	accordionplayer		
that	's	mutiny	brother		
yes	and	we	'll	all	come	up	here	together	and	we	'll	help	you	to	disinfect	with	a	vengeance	we	'll	make	a	bonfire		
he	was	licking	his	lips	which	meant	that	he	was	thirsty	and	wanted	a	drink		
cried	vassili	crushing	her	in	his	arms		
but	just	remember	this	i	never	got	in	your	way		
and	now	it	seemed	to	him	that	his	father	was	in	his	way	although	he	was	far	away	out	there	on	a	stretch	of	sand	almost	lost	to	view	then	it	seemed	to	him	that	malva	was	afraid	of	his	father	if	she	had	not	been	afraid	their	conversation	would	have	been	quite	different	now	he	seemed	to	want	her	though	this	morning	he	had	not	been	thinking	about	her		
jakoff	did	not	want	to	give	twenty	kopecks	but	he	had	been	warned	that	he	must	look	out	where	sereja	was	concerned	and	must	put	up	with	some	of	his	fancies		
i	can	see	for	myself	that	i	am	not	their	equal		
in	the	middle	of	the	room	the	doctor	began	to	dance	the	russian	national	dance	with	matrona	whilst	grischka	himself	played	on	the	accordion	and	laughed	lightheartedly	for	the	doctor	's	long	legs	were	quite	stiff	at	the	joints	and	he	stepped	in	a	dignified	way	like	a	heron	on	a	bog	by	the	side	of	matrona		
already	two	months		
in	the	corridor	outside	the	attendants	footsteps	could	be	heard	hurrying	backwards	and	forwards	and	grigori	tried	to	guess	from	the	sound	of	the	steps	who	was	passing		
he	was	still	watching	in	the	hopes	of	seeing	the	boat	when	the	surface	of	the	sea	began	to	darken		
he	asked	with	a	frown		
so	that	we	may	be	able	to	work	and	so	life	goes	round	in	a	circle	without	sense	or	meaning		
well	that	's	all	right	just	listen	now	my	friends		
it	does	n't	matter		
the	orloffs	sat	on	in	silence		
now	be	off		
at	the	cape	the	halfawakened	fishermen	were	moving	about	arranging	the	nets	in	the	boats		
unconsciously	his	thoughts	travelled	to	matronafor	he	could	talk	over	everything	with	her		
not	at	mine	but	at	jakoff	's		
let	me	go	jakoff	she	said	quietly	trying	to	loosen	his	throbbing	arms		
you	do	n't	say	so?and	about	a	dozen	are	getting	better	they	can	already	walk	about	but	they	are	quite	yellow	and	thin		
get	away	or	something	will	happen		
oh	she	is	nothing	to	me	now		
what	a	lot	of	foolish	people	you	are	all	of	you		
you	are	either	drunk	or	mad		
ca	n't	i	take	a	decision	for	myself		
ah		
cried	some	one		
you	can	speak	openly	do	n't	fear	to	give	trouble		
that	's	right		
and	then	notwithstanding	all	this	for	you	to	reproach	me	with	not	bearing	you	a	child		
grigori	drummed	with	his	fingers	on	his	knee	whilst	matrona	watched	him	and	sighed	softly		
and	they	fell	asleep	in	the	middle	of	the	conversation		
i	am	citizen	replied	sereja	with	pride		
he	was	still	holding	in	his	hand	the	twenty	kopecks		
it	's	enough	to	drive	one	mad	to	think	about	it		
do	n't	i		
what	is	the	reason		
he	cried	to	himself	and	he	tried	to	think	only	of	sereja	what	a	poisonous	lad	it	was	though		
what	sort	of	business	is	this		
well	as	a	final	word	of	caution	my	friends	use	plenty	of	chloride	of	lime		
my	breasts	they	are	like	two	white	swans	her	voice	rang	out	over	the	sea		
she	was	silent	jakoff	's	blue	eyes	were	searching	the	distance	far	out	over	the	sea		
have	you	quarrelled	with	vassili		
he	mocks	me	and	now	you	are	doing	the	same	and	you	are	the	two	who	are	the	nearest	to	me		
the	policeofficer	moved	on	one	side	and	with	a	rapid	step	a	medical	student	in	a	white	coat	entered	the	orloffs	dwelling	holding	his	cap	in	his	hand		
but	do	you	know	yourself	what	you	are	doing		
asked	orloff		
sereja	had	mischievously	misled	him		
and	he	rose	and	left	her		
the	heavy	door	of	the	vodkashop	where	orloff	and	i	sat	talking	swung	backwards	and	forwards	from	time	to	time	with	a	creaking	suggestive	sound		
he	swallowed	with	a	look	of	discontent	the	vodka	which	his	son	had	poured	out	for	him	and	taking	his	beard	in	his	hand	he	tugged	at	it	so	hard	that	his	head	shook		
i	have	come	in	to	say	goodbye	to	you	my	dear	friends	said	the	cook		
he	bums	like	a	clear	fire	she	said	delighted		
he	exclaimed	in	his	still	youthful	ringing	alto	voice		
heaven	itself	shall	rejoice	at	it		
what	will	happen	next		
we	had	to	repair	the	house	and	there	was	the	sister	's	marriage		
he	felt	himself	in	the	wrong	and	pitied	her	but	recalling	the	words	she	had	used	at	first	and	which	had	roused	his	anger	he	replied	gruffly	my	son	has	nothing	to	do	in	the	matter	and	if	i	have	beaten	you	it	was	because	you	deserved	it	why	did	you	nag	at	me		
as	far	as	you	are	concerned	it	does	you	no	harmquite	the	reverse	have	you	not	been	better	off	since	we	had	cholera	in	the	town		
so	this	was	what	was	in	your	mind		
well	what	is	it		
when	grigori	returned	it	was	already	dark		
would	n't	it	be	a	queer	sight		
then	he	kissed	her	mouth	slowly	and	with	the	sort	of	noise	that	he	would	have	made	when	eating	a	warm	thick	soup		
she	could	tell	by	the	way	he	walked	that	he	was	in	a	good	temper		
she	has	always	been	mad		
the	waves	moaned		
no	fear		
you	merry	little	bird		
yes	my	lad	continued	malva	without	looking	at	jakoff	i	may	be	tempting	but	not	for	you	and	let	me	tell	you	no	one	has	bought	me	i	am	not	the	property	of	your	father		
i	sha	n't	be	so	badly	off	there	i	shall	get	twenty	roubles	a	month	besides	tips	and	my	keep		
said	matrona	with	contrition		
wait	a	few	minutes	longer	the	moon	will	soon	be	up	what	do	i	want	with	the	moon		
cried	jakoff		
do	you	think	i	ca	n't	live	without	your	forgiveness		
tell	him	what	you	like	cried	jakoff		
struck	by	this	thought	grigori	continued	sullenly	the	most	simple	thing	would	be	for	you	to	remain	here		
she	said	still	laughing		
grischka	asked	his	wife	in	a	hoarse	voice		
when	he	shouted	the	hawk	was	scared	swept	upwards	swung	away	and	disappeared		
they	called	us	to	come	to	dinner		
if	he	did	not	want	to	answer	he	would	always	say	that	's	another	thing		
xii	the	illness	dried	him	up	still	more	burnt	something	out	of	him		
the	old	magician	stands	before	me	alien	to	all	a	solitary	traveller	through	all	the	deserts	of	thought	in	search	of	an	allembracing	truth	which	he	has	not	foundi	look	at	him	and	although	i	feel	sorrow	for	the	loss	i	feel	pride	at	having	seen	the	man	and	that	pride	alleviates	my	pain	and	grief		
but	you	must	clearly	have	read	a	great	deal	now	look	here	it	's	dangerous		
the	french	have	three	writers	stendhal	balzac	flaubert	and	well	perhaps	maupassant	though	tchekhov	is	better	than	he		
but	god	took	him	away	to	the	life	of	paradise	on	the	night	    	friday	to	saturday	in	passion	week	and	something	like	that	he	was	silent	and	then	nodding	his	head	and	smiling	faintly	added	in	human	stupidity	when	it	is	not	malicious	there	is	something	very	touching	even	beautiful		
but	with	your	peasants	in	every	story	everything	is	revealed	it	's	a	universal	council	of	wisdom		
i	should	think	you	do	n't	understand	women	they	do	n't	come	off	with	you		
no		
once	when	anton	pavlovitch	was	walking	on	the	lawn	with	alexandra	lvovna	tolstoi	who	at	the	time	was	still	ill	and	was	sitting	in	a	chair	on	the	terrace	seemed	to	stretch	towards	them	saying	in	a	whisper	ah	what	a	beautiful	magnificent	man	modest	and	quiet	like	a	girl		
why	should	not	nature	make	an	exception	to	her	law	give	to	one	man	physical	immortalitywhy	not		
i	said	that	probably	all	writers	are	to	some	extent	inventors	describing	people	as	they	would	like	to	see	them	in	life	i	also	said	that	i	liked	active	people	who	desire	to	resist	the	evil	of	life	by	every	means	even	violence		
you	are	evidently	not	much	of	a	lady	's	man		
someone	always	stolidly	stupid	as	a	flatiron	asked	what	do	you	say		
he	is	like	that	if	he	did	something	bad	it	would	be	out	of	pity	for	someone		
he	gave	us	the	gospels	in	order	that	we	might	forget	the	contradictions	in	christ	he	simplified	christ	's	image	smoothing	away	the	militant	elements	and	bringing	into	the	foreground	the	humble	will	of	him	that	sent	him		
all	his	life	he	feared	and	hated	death	all	his	life	there	throbbed	in	his	soul	the	arsamaxian	terror	must	he	die		
look	at	lovers	they	are	all	talented		
x	friedrich	of	prussia	said	very	truly	everyone	must	save	himself	in	his	own	way		
but	to	return	to	shestov		
he	had	in	him	i	think	the	inquisitive	mischievous	wildness	of	a	vaska	buslayev	and	also	something	of	the	stubbornness	of	soul	of	the	protopop	avvakum	while	above	or	at	his	side	lay	hidden	the	scepticism	of	a	tchaadayev		
that	is	a	sample	of	muscovite	russian	simple	and	hearty	and	here	is	another	but	freethinkerish	leo	nicolayevitch	though	i	disagree	with	your	religiousphilosophical	views	i	deeply	respect	in	your	person	the	greatest	of	artists		
for	the	tiulin	above	look	at	the	year	1905	and	for	the	oblomov	below	look	at	count	a.	n.	tolstoi	i.	bunin	look	at	everything	round	about	you		
saying	this	he	smiled	triumphantly	at	times	he	has	the	broad	calm	smile	of	a	man	who	has	overcome	something	extremely	difficult	or	from	whom	some	sharp	longgnawing	pain	has	lifted	suddenly		
surely	he	has	some	thoughts	of	which	he	is	afraid		
the	groom	is	there	is	n't	he		
at	last	by	god	's	grace	i	am	face	to	face	with	the	greatest	son	of	our	native	land		
i	once	saw	him	as	perhaps	no	one	has	ever	seen	him		
for	he	realizes	that	that	preaching	is	not	sufficiently	convincing	in	his	diary	you	will	some	day	read	good	instances	of	scepticism	applied	by	him	to	his	own	preaching	and	personality		
blue	blood	he	said	wiping	the	tears	from	his	eyes	that	's	itblue	blood		
then	i	walked	on	tiptoe	away	in	order	that	the	pebbles	might	not	scrunch	under	my	feet	not	wishing	to	distract	his	thoughts		
holiness	is	attained	by	flirting	with	sin	by	subduing	the	will	to	live		
i	remember	my	first	meeting	with	him	and	his	talk	about	varienka	oliessova	and	twentysix	and	one		
that	's	terrible		
not	only	by	the	labour	of	peasant	men	and	women	not	only	by	the	taxes	they	pay	but	in	the	literal	sense	by	their	blood		
footnote	1	in	kreutzer	sonata	footnote	2	words	used	by	quack	vets	for	the	diseases	of	horses		
they	had	studied	life	from	books	written	by	inventors	like	themselves	and	they	thought	it	a	serious	business	but	it	was	of	no	use	to	a	soul		
no	not	that	he	began	to	laugh	and	rolling	up	the	book	into	a	tube	he	put	it	into	the	big	pocket	of	his	blouse		
she	is	a	filthy	girl	and	her	breasts	like	pancakes	and	all	that		
and	the	other	the	weary	one	the	moneyloving	founder	of	the	familythat	's	true	too		
xiv	someone	sent	him	an	excellent	version	of	the	story	of	christ	's	godson		
well	now	he	is	probably	making	his	last	assault	in	order	to	give	to	his	ideas	the	highest	possible	significance		
in	his	two	eyes	leo	nicolayevitch	possessed	a	thousand	eyes		
and	when	she	lies	she	does	not	believe	herself	but	rousseau	lied	and	believed	his	lies		
xxx	how	strange	that	he	is	so	fond	of	playing	cards		
he	too	seemed	to	me	like	an	old	stone	come	to	life	who	knows	all	the	beginnings	and	the	ends	of	things	who	considers	when	and	what	will	be	the	end	of	the	stones	the	grasses	of	the	earth	of	the	waters	of	the	sea	and	of	the	whole	universe	from	the	pebble	to	the	sun		
and	a	doctor	of	medicine	the	words	giltchak	potchetchny	bloodletting,'[2	are	they	not	precisely	the	same	as	nerves	rheumatism	organisms	etc		
he	is	too	rational	for	that	and	knows	life	and	people	too	well		
then	after	a	pause	he	said	seriously	it	was	generous	in	you	to	strike	her	like	that	any	other	man	would	have	struck	her	on	the	head	for	that		
it	's	written	swaggeringly	but	it	's	all	right	and	interesting		
suddenly	i	noticed	that	there	were	tears	in	tolstoi	's	eyes	and	this	confused	me	and	i	stopped		
to	a	frenchman	woman	is	everything		
sulerzhizky	and	i	wrote	down	many	things	which	tolstoi	said	but	suler	lost	his	notes	when	he	came	to	me	at	arsamas	he	was	habitually	careless	and	although	he	loved	leo	nicolayevitch	like	a	woman	he	behaved	towards	him	rather	strangely	almost	like	a	superior		
that	's	politics	that	's	another	thing		
he	's	severe		
he	patted	me	on	the	shoulder		
here	are	some	more	of	his	words	the	kaliph	abdurahman	had	during	his	life	fourteen	happy	days	but	i	am	sure	i	have	not	had	so	many		
you	remember	that	andersen	says	the	gilt	will	come	off	and	the	pigskin	will	remain	just	as	our	peasants	say	everything	will	pass	away	the	truth	alone	will	remain		
but	i	believe	it		
he	spoke	musingly	as	though	asking	himself	questions		
well	now		
but	you	yourself	often	speak	in	aphorisms		
i	had	many	long	conversations	with	him	when	he	was	living	at	gaspra	in	the	crimea	i	often	went	to	him	and	he	liked	coming	to	me	i	have	studied	his	books	lovingly	it	seems	to	me	that	i	have	the	right	to	say	what	i	think	of	him	even	if	it	be	bold	and	differ	widely	from	the	general	opinion		
that	upset	my	idea	of	him	an	idea	which	was	deeply	rooted	and	had	become	dear	to	me		
someone	remarked	that	shestov	was	a	jew		
he	sat	down	on	the	sofa	and	after	a	moment	's	silence	suddenly	said	swaying	his	body	a	little	rubbing	the	palm	of	his	hand	on	his	knee	and	wrinkling	up	his	face	still	that	is	not	allnot	all		
he	knew	balzac		
but	undeniably	russia	as	a	whole	istiulin	above	and	oblomov	below		
my	letter	was	bitter	and	in	the	end	i	did	not	send	it	to	him		
very	generous		
he	laughed	heartily	at	the	scene	in	the	court	of	the	kazan	magistrate	konovalov	where	i	had	first	seen	the	man	whom	i	described	under	the	name	of	kuvalda		
he	listens	attentively	as	though	recalling	something	which	he	has	forgotten	or	as	though	waiting	for	something	new	and	unknown
