by	the	time	-PRON-	have	gigantic	mass	such	as	the	earth	or	the	sun	the	gravitational	interaction	between	-PRON-	and	other	body	be	also	gigantic		
within	many	nucleus	the	neutron	be	quite	stable	and	do	not	break	up	as	-PRON-	do	in	isolation

these	charge	particle	have	to	be	energetic	to	overcome	the	repulsion	of	the	nucleus	and	to	smash	into	-PRON-	with	enough	force	to	break	-PRON-	up

no	temperature	available	to	the	physicist	of	the	1920	could	force	atom	to	smash	together	hard	enough	to	reach	and	shake	the	nucleus		
-PRON-	seem	reasonable	then	to	suppose	that	a	nucleus	would	contain	about	half	as	many	electron	in	addition	to	the	proton		
more	and	more	electron	seem	to	be	require	finally	when	the	total	number	of	proton	be	84	or	more	no	amount	of	electron	seem	sufficient	to	stabilize	the	nucleus
