what	could	be	wrong		
he	felt	no	urge	for	the	old	man	's	silent	company	and	turned	back	into	his	room	to	prepare	for	slumber		
what	a	day	that	was		
then	say	it		
leucon	who	is	called	the	grey	weaver	told	me	she	explained	smiling		
he	raised	his	hand	as	dan	appeared		
promise	me		
there	are	no	cities	here		
she	broke	a	law	replied	the	girl	tonelessly		
it	's	a	law		
why	foolish	one		
what	song	is	that		
he	struggled	to	his	knees	wallsludwig	's	roomencompassed	him	he	must	have	slipped	from	the	chair		
she	spoke		
she	leaned	very	close		
i	love	her	too	said	dan		
i	do	n't	know		
who	are	you		
forgotten	now	were	the	words	of	the	grey	weaver		
dan	ceased	his	questioning	content	for	the	moment	to	drink	in	the	beauty	about	him	and	then	galatea	returned	bearing	a	crystal	bowl	of	the	strange	fruits		
galatea	was	dancing	up	the	path	eating	a	strange	fruit	as	rosy	as	her	lips		
for	this	is	impossible	in	paracosma	it	is	a	confliction	with	the	laws		
growled	leucon		
i	was	told	said	the	other		
she	stood	suddenly	erect	pallid	as	an	ivory	carving		
she	tossed	it	in	his	startled	face	and	skipped	on		
but	she	yielded	finally	to	the	law	and	is	forever	unhappy	and	goes	wandering	from	place	to	place	about	the	world		
the	house	and	trees	were	always	here		
a	law	forbids	it		
muttered	dan		
and	when	the	story	is	recorded	then	i	put	the	solution	in	my	spectaclemy	movie	projector		
shadow	land		
she	laughed	and	chose	a	similar	morsel	biting	a	tiny	puncture	in	the	end	she	squeezed	the	contents	into	her	mouth		
she	stretched	out	her	bare	arm		
they	'll	return	some	day		
he	queried		
no		
eagerness	crept	into	his	voice		
he	followed	her	with	his	burden	of	fruit	his	mind	was	once	more	in	a	turmoil	of	doubt	and	perplexity		
she	shook	her	head		
he	noted	in	sudden	concern	that	her	eyes	were	glistening	with	tears		
galatea	twisted	him	a	brightblossomed	garland	for	his	head	and	thereafter	he	moved	always	with	a	sweet	singing	about	him		
a	little	copse	appeared	ahead	not	of	the	gigantic	forest	trees	but	of	lesser	growths	bearing	flowers	and	fruits	of	iridescent	colors	and	a	tiny	brook	bubbled	through		
galatea	said		
they	were	piled	in	colorful	disorder	red	purple	orange	and	yellow	pearshaped	eggshaped	and	clustered	spheroidsfantastic	unearthly		
he	told	himself		
that	is	a	law		
of	course		
i	ca	n't	dearest	one		
she	stared	at	him	dumbly	miserably	but	made	no	sound		
why	this	is	paracosma	of	course	and	this	is	our	language		
a	faint	smile	showed	again	on	her	lips	as	she	dropped	a	metal	covering	over	the	shining	sphere		
asked	dan		
leucon	calls		
a	man	and	a	woman	live	off	there	she	said	gesturing	toward	a	distant	blue	range	of	hills	dim	on	the	horizon		
galatea	what	place	is	this		
almost	instantly	it	seemed	the	dawn	was	upon	him	and	bright	elfin	pipings	were	all	about	him	while	the	odd	ruddy	sun	sent	a	broad	slanting	plane	of	light	across	the	room		
he	was	over	the	river	now	on	the	forest	bank	running	through	columned	vistas	that	whirled	about	him	like	mist		
then	woe	to	both	of	you		
he	felt	a	sense	of	foreboding	nothing	pleasant	awaited	him		
you	will	look	at	it	mr.		
i	shall	be	sorry	very	sorry		
gasped	dan		
oh	it	must	be		
by	a	law		
a	flash	of	silver	beyond	the	river	at	the	edge	of	the	forest		
he	weaves	it	out	of	metal	bars	on	a	very	clever	machine		
then	the	sun	was	hidden	the	shadow	fingers	darkened	the	meadow	of	a	sudden	the	flowers	were	still	and	the	brook	gurgled	alone	in	a	world	of	silence		
see		
she	moved	toward	the	door	and	there	paused	taking	his	hand		
he	thrust	her	away		
leucon	is	very	wise	and	i	am	bound	to	obey	him	but	this	is	beyond	his	wisdom	because	he	let	himself	grow	old		
she	said	tensely		
a	name		
dan	uttered	puzzled	words	of	thanks	and	the	old	man	nodded	reseating	himself	on	the	carven	bench	galatea	skipped	through	the	arched	entrance	and	dan	after	an	irresolute	moment	dropped	to	the	remaining	bench		
dan	thought	a	moment		
a	faint	deliciously	sweet	perfume	breathed	against	him	he	glanced	up	to	watch	the	opening	of	a	great	crimson	blossom	on	the	nearest	tree	and	a	tiny	reddish	sun	edged	into	the	circle	of	sky	above	him		
violation	is	always	unhappiness		
not	where	i	live	galatea		
her	lovely	piquant	face	was	still	troubled		
why	not		
permitted	by	whom		
a	little	creature	about	as	big	as	a	large	rat	it	was	gray	and	huddled	and	evidently	startled	by	our	appearance		
just	at	evening	as	the	sun	dropped	behind	the	horizon	with	the	suddenness	of	a	candle	falling	into	the	sea	the	auxiliary	flashed	out	of	the	southern	heavens	easing	gently	down	on	the	flaming	wings	of	the	underjets		
they	do	n't	know	about	atomic	energy		
tweel	's	people	have	a	different	system	from	any	of	us		
but	beside	me	i	heard	leroy	's	cry	of	yvonne		
so	we	did		
he	echoed		
queer	is	n't	itas	if	mother	nature	were	carrying	on	two	experiments	one	at	home	and	one	on	mars		
i	think	the	symbol	was	exploration	or	discovery		
close	to	what	corresponds	to	the	antarctic	circle		
i	tell	you	one	moment	we	were	looking	at	a	grey	valley	covered	with	blobby	plants	and	the	nextlord		
my	guess	at	the	city	's	ageand	it	may	be	wrong	by	a	big	percentagewould	be	fifteen	thousand	years		
a	ruin	eh		
tweel	fumed	and	whistled	in	wrath	picked	up	the	volume	and	slammed	it	into	place	on	a	shelf	full	of	others		
well	damage	by	meteorites	must	be	slow	anyway		
tweel	's	civilization	is	decadent	that	's	the	reason		
the	place	was	as	quiet	as	a	grave	but	we	kept	imagining	things	and	peeping	down	the	dark	lanes	between	buildings	and	looking	over	our	shoulders		
the	creatures	have	been	bred	to	it		
far	above	us	a	little	crack	let	in	a	pallid	ray	of	daylight	not	nearly	enough	to	light	the	place	i	could	n't	even	see	if	the	hall	rose	clear	to	the	distant	roof		
then	we	broke	for	the	door		
more	or	less	agreed	jarvis		
as	a	display	of	architectural	power	the	city	was	colossal	as	anything	else	it	was	just	nutty		
every	good	impulse	yesbut	also	every	nasty	little	wish	every	vicious	thought	everything	you	'd	ever	desired	good	or	bad		
he	had	come	leaping	from	behind	as	i	crashed	down	i	saw	him	flash	over	me	straight	towardtoward	what	i	'd	been	running	to	with	his	vicious	beak	pointed	right	at	her	heart		
never	mind	that		
that	's	primitive		
they	dropped	to	a	sitting	posture	waiting	for	their	bodies	trained	by	months	in	acclimatization	chambers	back	on	earth	to	accommodate	themselves	to	the	tenuous	air		
the	desert	was	spottedwith	buildings		
the	captain	was	sputtering		
when	i	scrambled	up	that	particular	image	was	gone	and	tweel	was	in	a	twist	of	black	ropey	arms	just	as	when	i	first	saw	him		
huh		
no	breet		
look	hereon	the	earth	we	have	three	types	of	society	have	n't	we		
yeah	tweel	's	people	reproduce	just	like	the	barrels	in	the	mud	cities	two	individuals	grow	a	third	one	between	them		
jarvis	flushed		
the	thing	was	still	there		
we	had	a	clue	did	n't	we		
well		
well	we	stood	frozen	for	a	moment	while	leroy	's	yell	reverberated	back	and	forth	between	the	distant	walls	and	the	echoes	repeated	the	words	in	queer	thin	voices		
we	made	out	a	giant	seated	figure	one	of	the	beaked	martians	like	tweel	but	with	every	limb	suggesting	heaviness	weariness		
like	an	old	maid	's	heart		
well	those	were	the	words	he	used	to	describe	the	silicon	monster	they	were	also	the	words	he	had	used	to	tell	me	that	the	image	of	fancy	long	the	one	that	had	almost	lured	me	to	the	dreambeast	was	n't	real		
and	you	ca	n't	have	any	form	of	government	which	governs	less	than	anarchy	which	is	no	government	at	all		
right		
countered	jarvis		
commented	harrison		
and	putz	and	i	think	so	too		
it	's	too	bad	we	have	n't	an	archeologist	with	us	but	leroy	tells	me	that	there	was	a	stoneage	culture	in	egypt	then	the	predynastic	civilization		
exclaimed	the	captain		
do	n't	human	beings	tend	to	relate	everything	to	themselves		
how	could	we	tell		
i	wish	you	'd	seen	it	karl	you	'll	have	to	make	what	you	can	from	our	pictures		
no	point	in	wars	here	the	population	is	too	thin	and	too	scattered	and	besides	it	takes	the	help	of	every	single	community	to	keep	the	canal	system	functioning		
well	we	sailed	out	into	the	desert	about	twenty	miles	which	put	the	city	below	the	horizon	in	case	we	overslept	and	there	we	spent	the	night		
it	was	n't	all	exactly	pretty		
leroy	's	face	as	always	turned	a	smothered	blue	and	jarvis	heard	his	own	breath	rasping	and	rattling	in	his	throat		
a	t'ermocouple		
that	beautiful	evil	devilish	panorama	was	in	my	mind	not	my	eyes		
can	you	describe	it		
no	rainfall	no	earthquakes	no	vegetation	is	here	to	spread	cracks	with	its	rootsnothing		
ants	are	willing	to	die	for	their	anthill	so	are	these	creatures		
that	's	how	those	fiends	workthrough	the	mind		
as	we	reached	the	crest	tweel	spun	his	head	completely	around	so	his	feet	were	forward	but	his	eyes	looked	backward	as	if	he	feared	to	gaze	into	the	valley		
and	leroy	believes	further	that	it	is	n't	an	intelligent	arrangementnot	on	the	part	of	the	barrels	at	leastbut	that	it	's	been	done	for	so	many	thousands	of	generations	that	it	's	become	instinctivea	tropismjust	like	the	actions	of	ants	and	bees		
well		
he	assumed	a	gruffness	as	the	weary	pair	sat	down		
then	he	held	that	dim	torch	of	his	toward	the	walls	and	they	were	pictured		
they	had	n't	forgotten	me	either	they	all	drummed	out	we	are	vrriendsouch		
so	we	followed	him	staring	nervously	about	for	the	thing	that	had	watched	us		
i	kept	careful	note	of	our	directions	since	we	could	n't	risk	getting	lost	in	that	gigantic	maze		
that	's	why	they	're	dying		
he	resumed	his	narrative		
that	was	the	phrase	he	had	used	to	explain	the	dreambeast	to	tell	me	that	what	i	thought	the	creature	thoughtto	tell	me	how	the	thing	lured	its	victims	by	their	own	desires		
dimly	countered	harrison		
how	do	you	mean		
i	should	've	known	better	than	to	let	you	wander	off	alone		
but	the	sun	dropped	out	of	sight	right	then		
nine	out	of	ten	buildings	meant	absolutely	nothing	to	usjust	vast	empty	chambers	full	of	shadows	and	rustlings	and	echoes		
and	there	's	a	member	of	each	type	right	here		
nuts		
with	a	perfect	race	you	would	n't	need	it	at	all	government	is	a	confession	of	weakness	is	n't	it		
without	our	thermoskin	bags	night	would	finish	us	even	if	what	lurked	in	the	ruins	did	n't		
comme	l'egypte	yeah	said	jarvis		
thank	my	kindly	nature	that	i	marked	your	arm	instead	of	your	face		
got	a	good	memory	for	faces		
your	body	torn	and	broken	spotted	with	bloodthat	might	be	a	pleasure	second	only	to	that	i	plan		
still	there	on	the	open	porch	in	practically	full	daylight	and	for	so	brief	a	timedr	carl	would	be	coming	very	shortly	she	reasoned		
blood	on	your	lips		
eight	o'clock	she	remarked	to	her	image	time	to	be	leaving	and	it	serves	dr.	carl	right	for	his	highhanded	actions	last	night		
nicholas	she	said	wearily	clinging	desperately	to	a	remnant	of	logic	what	do	you	want	of	me		
she	seized	the	flask	filling	her	tumbler	to	the	brim	while	her	companion	watched	her	with	impassive	gaze		
want	me		
i	do	n't	know	one	from	the	other	our	choice	must	be	blind		
close	your	eyes	and	choose		
i	did	it	out	of	spite	because	i	saw	he	didn'tcare	for	me		
28	lunar	omen	after	a	considerable	interval	during	which	nick	held	the	girl	tightly	and	silently	in	his	arms	he	released	her	sat	with	his	head	resting	on	his	cupped	palms	in	an	attitude	of	deep	study		
she	tore	her	eyes	away		
rather	cold	ruthless	domineering		
so	be	it		
not	her	fine	tender	sensitive	nick		
she	puckered	her	lips	impudently	at	him	as	she	slipped	by	him	into	the	house		
that	's	all	i	know		
she	did	n't	know	could	n't	imagine		
bargain		
with	his	lips	still	crushing	hers	he	raised	her	in	his	arms	she	felt	herself	borne	across	the	room		
i	do	n't		
if	he	's	crazy	i	am	too	a	fine	couple	we	are		
i	'm	going	to	answer	that	bell	he	ended		
so		
nick		
not	i	but	i	've	talked	with	them	that	had		
fire	away	dr.		
but	i	must		
he	frowned	perplexedly	then	looked	up	abruptly		
i	just	wanted	to	ask	you	a	few	hypothetical	questions		
then	the	priest	came	and	he	said	it	was	n't	a	natural	wolf		
she	drew	the	letter	from	her	pocket	and	then	with	a	tightening	of	her	throat	tore	open	the	envelope	slipping	out	the	several	pages	of	scrawled	paper		
well	neither	i	nor	any	reputable	medic	claims	to	know	everything	and	the	human	mind	's	a	subtle	sort	of	thing		
he	nodded		
the	girl	drew	herself	erect	and	leaned	back	against	the	wall	shaking	her	head	to	drive	the	tears	from	her	eyes		
you	're	no	coward	dear		
she	listened	idly	to	distract	herself	from	the	chain	of	despondency	that	was	her	thoughts	and	was	mildly	startled	to	recognize	the	booming	drums	of	dr.	horker	's	voice		
i	know	that	much	about	the	book	at	least		
she	sighed	mounted	the	steps	and	fumbled	for	her	key		
queer	is	n't	it		
we	got	rid	of	the	pig		
say	it	's	because	i	'm	acting	in	loco	parentis		
no	walk		
his	voice	was	unchanged	she	stared	at	him	in	complete	bafflement		
now	of	course	it	was	different	she	had	so	definitely	tagged	herself	with	the	same	nicholas	devine	that	even	the	most	ardent	of	the	group	had	taken	the	warning		
you	know	i	'm	crazy	about	you	and	she	whispered	in	his	ear	so	's	mother		
which	one"an	hysterical	laughing	sob	shook	her"will	wear	the	longest		
that	's	all		
you	would	too	if	you	did	n't	fly	into	a	panic	every	time	some	little	difficulty	confronts	you		
her	eyes	turned	troubled		
now		
she	told	herself		
he	surveyed	her	sitting	in	her	chair	she	had	dropped	her	chin	to	her	hand	to	steady	the	whirling	of	her	head		
no	one	's	strong	who	has	n't	given	up	hope		
heaven	knows	why	i	should	be	but	it	's	a	fact		
but	what	do	you	think	it	is		
she	snapped		
please	pat	let	's	not	spoil	tonight	if	i	could	tell	you	i	would		
then	according	to	him	the	devil	was	nothing	more	than	an	invention	of	nick	's	mind	the	trick	of	a	cowardly	child	to	evade	just	punishment		
it	's	over	and	i	've	given	my	promise		
he	said	and	was	again	silent		
applauded	the	girl		
what	of	it		
where	are	you	going	child		
i	was	n't	at	all		
you	were	extremely	attractive	as	i	attired	you	saturday	the	other	proceeded		
it	took	me	hours	to	locate	mueller	and	get	this	address	from	him		
given	the	opportunity		
that	's	what	you	saidan	experiment		
yes		
she	looked	out	upon	a	dimlit	street	or	court	at	the	blind	end	of	which	the	house	was	apparently	situated		
there	is	still	a	depth	of	beauty	unplumbed	a	pain	whose	exquisite	pleasure	is	yet	to	find		
my	head	aches	andi'm	scared		
that	's	heaven	he	said	pointing	a	finger	at	the	great	flowing	lunar	disk		
how	does	he	like	me		
in	the	dim	distance	before	them	red	as	antares	glowed	the	taillight	of	some	automobile	except	for	this	lone	evidence	of	humanity	reflected	pat	they	might	have	been	flashing	through	the	cosmic	depths	of	interstellar	space	instead	of	following	a	highway	in	the	very	shadow	of	chicago		
carl		
and	the	next	night	he	went	out	once	more		
he	wo	n't	do	it		
i	ca	n't	she	repeated		
the	memory	of	the	terrible	eyes	of	that	other	had	clicked	too	aptly	to	magda	's	phrase
