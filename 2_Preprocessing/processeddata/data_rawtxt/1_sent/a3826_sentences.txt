"We married, James.		
Nussbaum suddenly jingled.		
I munched it and conjugated Latin verbs in my head, trying to make the day pass.		
He raised one eyebrow quizzically when I came through the door at 8:00 that morning.		
I looked up just in time to see two small figures jetting away upwards.		
It's disgusting.		
Your report card and diploma are waiting on my desk."		
"If you say so," he said.		
I opened it, and read the inscription he'd written: "From one traveller to another, Merry Christmas."		
"What kind of books?"		
He seemed sincere.		
he said, taking a step backwards.		
I tried not to watch them.		
I thought that maybe it had been on our bookcase in 75, but somehow, it hadn't made it back home with us.		
Oly swung the axe a few more times.		
He sold a Centurian half a million defective umbrellas from his brotherinlaw's factory.		
"No, sir.		
He flipped it open and grunted "Nussbaum," into it.		
I was too stunned even to cry or howl.		
The fingers of dawn crept across my comprehension.		
I was about to tell him that I'd keep it to myself, but at the last minute, some instinct told me to keep my mouth shut.		
Mr Adelson looked up from my essay.		
Get your behind down here now!"		
Oly gave me a queer look.		
# Mama didn't get any less mad through the night, but when she came to my door at cockcrow, she seemed to be holding it in better.		
Pa's last trip had been to the Dalai Lama's court in 1975.		
"That's fine with me," Oly said and glared at me.		
"I guess I just got lost.		
"To tell you the truth, James, I just don't think I'm cut out for this line of work.		
The sun filtered down over me, warm through the big dome, and I realised that even though I'd gotten myself stuck in 75, been 'jacked, and left in the worst neighbourhood in the whole State, I'd landed on my feet.		
There was the bookcase full of wild theories and fantastic adventure stories.		
I ran for the shore, and saw one of the Allen brothers surfacing, rubbing at his head and laughing.		
Truth be told, I hated calculus, hated Isaac Newton and asymptotes and the whole smelly business.		
He stood and walked towards the WC.		
Some hero I was!		
I walked to one wall and laid my palm against it, the familiar cool glassy stuff it was made of.		
Finding it hard to relate to the other fellows?"		
We will be studying maths today in the seniors' class.		
"Books?"		
But in my mind, I kept seeing my Mama and that Johnstone kissing under the mistletoe, and him sitting in my Pa's chair, drinking his whiskey.		
Mr Adelson smoothed his hair back and stepped aside.		
"Mama, it's a mistake " I began.		
I missed the old me, and felt him slipping away.		
Am I right?"		
Mr Adelson, who was raised in San Francisco and who had worked as a roustabout, a telegraph operator and a merchant seaman taught the Academy, and his wild stories were all Oly could talk about.		
I plucked them out.		
"Your father's successor," Mr Johnstone said.		
It had been a month since our return.		
That was hard, James."		
I was near to tears when I remembered the emergency override.		
I'd never seen a schoolteacher smoking before.		
The flight was peaceful and dreamlike, a slow descent over the gleaming metal city.		
"Now, you and I know that there's a difference between smart and greedy.		
"James Arthur Nicholson!		
Below, in his seaman's hand, he'd written, "James' performance this semester has disappointed me gravely.		
He hadn't said much, just ate calmly and waited for Pondicherry to run out of steam.		
Before I knew what was happening, she had me over her knee and was paddling my bottom with her open hand, hard.		
I knew enough to know that the agencies that policed the protocols had their hands full keeping track of art and gold smugglers.		
The voice said a dirty word that would've gotten it beaten blackandblue back home, and then the hands were gone.		
Nussbaum raised an eyebrow and studied me.		
# I went straight home, pelting down the road as fast as I could, not even looking where I was going.		
I folded up the waxedpaper, and thought about this adult who talked to me like an adult, who didn't worry about swearing, or telling me about his adventures, and I made my way back to class.		
# In 75, Pa had almost never been home, but his presence was always around us.		
She knew I didn't like him one little bit, and she said that I would just have to learn to live with what I didn't like, and if that was the only thing I learned from her, it would be enough.		
I was engrossed in a caterpillar that was crawling up my pantsleg when Mr Adelson cleared his throat behind me.		
"I do say so.		
Wells.		
Even on Christmas Eve, I was too distracted to really enjoy the smells of goose and ham and the stuffing Mama spent days preparing.		
It may be what the trade court decides.		
She'd been terrified of spiders when she was a girl, and she told me that she had made a point of picking up every spider she saw and letting it crawl around on her face.		
Mr Johnstone had given her a tin of cosmetics from Paris, that he'd ordered in special.		
"It's fine, sir."		
I'd been back for a month, and in all that time, Oly had skittered around me like a shy pony, always nearby but afraid to talk to me.		
Be that way.		
He tousled my hair.		
"Sometimes," I said.		
"Don't say anything, don't touch anything.		
"Oh, a secret.		
Finally, it was too much for me.		
It's been a long day."		
"Mama doesn't like me eating sweets," I said, and stared at my reflection in my shoes.		
He took them both and put them away in a closet.		
"No, really!		
"I will return, Chet.		
Chet didn't understand any of it.		
I don't want to talk about him right now.		
My view stretched 8m down, an impossible, dizzying height.		
The guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla had an ocean in his apt.		
I've found the electromagnetic frequencies that the various coral resonate on, and by using those as a carrier wave, I can stimulate them into tremendously accelerated growth.		
I was thinking so hard, I stopped thinking about what I was saying to The Amazing Robotron.		
He is so screwed up."		
### Home Again, Home Again ====================== The kids in my local bathouse breathe heavy metals, and their gelatinous bodies quiver nauseously during our counseling sessions, and for all that, they reacted just like I had when I told them I was going away for a while  with hurt and betrayal, and they aroused palpable guilt in me.		
And he ushered Chet out of his apt and closed the door, leaving him in the featureless hallway of the 125th storey.		
Just stay there.		
IT MAY BE THAT I AM THE ONLY ONE YOU CAN TALK TO HERE AT THE CENTER.		
In doing so, he began to normalize the experience, to structure it as a story he could tell the other kids, after.		
With important friends, you can make a whole block of apts simply disappear from the recordbooks.		
I will be gone for a few months  I have to return home.		
Nicola Tesla spoke well and carefully, and I'd started to ape him.		
Chet opened his mouth to protest, and his father shouted him down before he could speak.		
"Yes.		
The lot of them are amorphous, indistinguishable from each other in his memory, all that remains of all those clever little brats is the lingering impression of loud, boasting voices and sharp little teeth.		
"So now I use Old Sparky here to recharge  please forgive the expression  my connection with the current.		
Tiny fish wriggled in the coral, tearing at the green fuzz that grew over it.		
My mouth is pasty, and salty, and sweat keeps running down into my eyes.		
He whirled on me.		
# I take roomservice, pizza and beer in an icebucket: pretentious, but better than sharing a diningroom with the menagerie.		
It helps.		
The cabby isn't even out of breath when we pull up at the Royal York, which, thankfully, is still clothed in its ancient dressed stone.		
The records say that the locks have never been used, the doors never opened.		
And I heard nothing.		
He's eleven, and it's the tencennial of the Ascension of his homeworld  dirty blue ball, so unworthy, yet  inducted into the Galactic fraternity and the infinite compassion of the bugouts.		
I haven't been paying much attention lately."		
Batty.		
I've come here to get away from all the treachery, the deceit, the filthy pursuit of the dollar.		
"You know, like, the whole fricken thing.		
"If water gets into the mask, just push at the top and blow out through your nose!"		
Hell, it was the first time he'd expressed any opinion about anything I'd said.		
My parents gamely tried to explain why we were going, but they never understood, no more than any human could.		
I've gotta blow, 'K?"		
I've used this trick on my kids.		
Which is so stupid, 'cause the ceilings in our old house weren't no higher than the ceilings here, and besides, Dad screwed up all the plaster when he was trying to fix it up, and it was always cracking.		
I don't think I wanna be a pilot no more.		
"That may be true, Chet.		
"No, I haven't.		
Have you thought about any other possibilities?"		
It won't be searched when they evacuate the bathouse.		
But by the time I take my second bite, it's just pizza and a brew.		
Well, there you are."		
I suggest that you start by examining your friends.		
He spoke as he tinkered with his apparatus, which hummed alarmingly and occasionally sent a tortured arc of electricity into the guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla's chest.		
and the ball whipped up and away, spearing itself on the point of one of the towers on the opposite side of the room.		
I'm fine," Chet said.		
Chet's father stooped and took the remote out of Chet's hands and opened up a bookmarked docudrama about the coming of the bugouts.		
He's batshit  he gets angry too easy.		
The only sound was my breathing, and distant, metallic pink!s from the ocean's depths.		
"I just don't care about them, to be frank."		
How have you been?"		
One of my buds tole me that you end up all fugged up with time an' that, that you come home an' it's the next century an' everyone you know is dead."		
"Chet, Chet, Chet.		
He must have dozed, because the next thing he knew, he was tipping over backwards into the apt, and the guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla was standing over him, concerned.		
Miscellaneous 		
		
a.		
Your counselor was here looking for you."		
"Yeh, yeh, fine.

"You see?		
I smiled, a huge grin, and it broke the seal on my mask, filling it with water.		
Worried about, uh, the future."		
I climbed into the ocean, and the silence embraced me, and the water tingled with electricity, and my consciousness floated away from my body and soared over an alien world.		
I can't remember.		
No, no.		
Chet's mother dropped a plastic tumbler, which bounced twice, and rolled to Chet's toe.		
"You can't imagine how long I've waited to show that trick to someone!		
My pulse beat under my skin.		
A narrow, elegant angelfish swam directly beneath me, and tickled my belly with one of its fins as it passed under.		
"Never mind that!		
The little one needs the big one, so that he can feel useful.		
he said, his voice muffled by the hood.		
You know how worried your mother was?"		
I entered his apt, and even my feet were too surprised to go on.		
Think of it as a trick I do, if it makes you feel better.		
You're progressing nicely."		
It has the smell of a million transient guests, aftershaves and perfumes and pheromones, and the stale recirc air I remember so well.		
The bathouse breathed around him, a million farts and snores and whispered words.		
"I've been OK." "Have you been studying mathematics and physics?		
I spent an age in the water, holding my breath, chasing the fish, disembodied, a consciousness on tour on an alien world.		
That was four.		
He pointed at the dormer windows in the top room.		
"He was naked and hard, and he had the knife in his fist, not like for slicing, but for stabbing, and his eyes were red from the smoke at the club, and the bathroom filled with the boozebreath smell, and I sank down in the tub, shrinking away from him as he grabbed for me.		
David said, glaring at him.		
They all had big shoulders and clothing that looked like the kind of thing the Hasids wore, black and sober.		
He was delighted by the dumpsters full of plush toys, by the lightly used office furniture, by the technical books and the CDs of last year's software.		
It hurt so much I bit through two thicknesses of towel.		
Krishna had his hand down the little girl's top now, cupping her breast, then laughing when she slapped it away.		
The guy was slightly Asianlooking, tall, with a sharp suit that managed to look casual and expensive at the same time.		
"They work," Kurt said.		
He wrote *about* drugs, not *on* drugs."		
"You know as well as I do!		
She tenderly stroked his hair until the hiccups subsided, then clawed at his belly again, sending him rolling through the mud.		
Alan pondered its crusty, clawed form, thinking that it looked like it belonged to someone  some*thing*  else.		
They're not like other people.		
Alan said.		
Alan pursed his lips and watched Kurt prod at the keyboard.		
"You're.		
She repeated it, and on the fourth try she got the idea of using the match to light all the remaining matches in the folder and drop that into the bin.		
They ate their lunches together again, and she filled the silence with a running commentary of the deficiencies of the sandwich her father had packed her, the strange odors coming from the brown bag that Alan had brought, filled with winter mushrooms and some soggy bread and cheese, and the hairiness of the mole on the lunch lady's chin.		
The golems' cave was lined with small bones and skulls, rank and row climbing the walls, twined with dried grasses in ascending geometries.		
"Got to get him home," Alan said, lifting Benny up with a grunt.		
He thrashed like a raccoon in a trap, and Alan forced the back of his head down so that his face was mashed against the cool floor, muffling his cries.		
"Your brother?"		
Alan asked.		
Alan said.		
"You should try the icepack again," he said weakly.		
At first the sound was barely audible, a soughing through the tunnels, but gradually the echoes chased each other round the great cavern and across the still, dark surface of the lake, and then a voice, illusive as a face in the clouds.		
He couldn't say the words.		
she said, after they'd watched a jackrabbit hop up the mountainside and disappear into the woods.		
She looked up in alarm.		
Alan was still young and had a penchant for the dramatic, so he went around to the kitchen and pulled a bottle of vodka out of the freezer and banged it down on the counter, pouring out four shots.		
Alan held the knife tighter.		
Billy got big enough to walk, then big enough to pick mushrooms, then big enough to chase squirrels.		
He scrabbled to fit his chubby hand into his jacket's pocket, then fished out a little black pebble.		
We're trying to raise bus fare to Burning Man?		
Sometimes for weeks."		
He crossed the room and sat on the other end of the sofa, his hand on the seam that joined the two halves together, crossing the border into her territory, an invitation that could be refused without awkwardness.		
She looked glumly at the road unraveling before them, grey and hissing with rain.		
His body bucked of its own accord, and he knocked Danny loose of his legs.		
He had a sense that he wasn't welcome there, that it was not intended for his consumption.		
The first time, they just stood in silence, wiping their cramped hands on their thighs.		
I know it's hard for you " She squeezed his hand.		
They were all poor students, so none of 		
them had landline numbers you could look up in the phone book, 		
but that was okay, since they all had accounts with the video 		
store where she worked, with their deadbeat prepaid mobile 		
numbers listed.		
For the first time he could remember, she looked flustered.		
She nodded.		
That's not normal."		
* To tell him *If this demo fails, it's because you fucked off and left it to the last minute.		
From the trash, mostly.		
Your brother.		
"You're invited?"		
He thought he'd figured out how to fit in, that he'd observed people to the point that he could be one, but he was so wrong.		
For a second, Alan harbored a germ of hope that he'd bested Krishna and so scared him into leaving him alone.		
"You *live* here?"		
Alan leaned in and saw that it was a milkweed pod.		
Alan looked to his neighbors' porch.		
"Quiet," Dewayne said.		
Alan put his hands over his face and sobbed, because he'd failed his responsibilities as eldest of their family and there was no one he could tell his woes to.		
Alan patiently picked dripping Edward up and put him over one shoulder, and gave Frederick the tube to suck.		
He'd rehearsed what he'd say to her all morning: *Do you believe me?		
I thought about using it on him, too, but only for a second.		
"It's all right," she said coldly.		
I got a crummy little basement in what the landlord called Cabbagetown but what was really Regent Park, and I switched out to a huge, anonymous high school to finish school.		
He gave Alan a dirty look, as though his insistence on preflighting were the root of their problems.		
I walked back here from Eglinton."		
Shopkeepers smiled and nodded, shoppers mouthed, "So cute," to each other.		
He forked up the rest of his omelet, looked reflexively up at the blinkenlights on the AP over the Greek's sign, just above the apostrophe, where he'd nailed it up two months before.		
Geography.		
I was just minding my own business and you came by, I just didn't want to be bothered, this is *my* place!"		
"Wait!"		
I picked my way out of the water again and I walked to the shore, and it was too dark to put on my clothes, so I carried them under one arm and felt my way back to the summer cave and leaned against my mother and waited to drip dry.		
They can't even steal my stuff, because when they try, when they come for my shoes or my food in the night, I'm always awake and watching them and just shaking my head."		
Something moved in the bushes, moved into his line of sight.		
They started walking now, Billy's limp more pronounced.		
Benny took a step off the hill.		
"Yeah," he said.		
"Right," Alan said, sipping his coffee.		
"We *could* use a focused antenna, but if I move a little bit off the beam"  he nudged the coffee cup to one side  "we're dead.		
I'm not poor."		
His shout had drawn older librarians from receiving areas and offices behind the counter, women with the look of persons accustomed to terminating children's mischief and ejecting rowdy drunks with equal aplomb.		
He took another step closer and he must have triggered a motion sensor because the porch light switched on.		
The sound made his neck prickle and when he looked at the little ones, he saw that their eyes were rolling crazily.		
Davey's murder was still to come.
