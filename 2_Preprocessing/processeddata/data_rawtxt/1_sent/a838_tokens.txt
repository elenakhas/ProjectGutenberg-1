yet	whatever	haste	he	made	to	the	goal	of	ebriety	he	was	distanced	by	his	brother	baronet	who	from	the	beginning	of	the	party	had	made	little	other	use	of	his	mouth	than	to	receive	the	glass	and	now	sunk	down	upon	the	floor	in	a	state	of	temporary	annihilation		
and	both	replying	in	the	negative	she	assumed	an	air	of	severity	and	determination	and	demanding	their	keys	threatened	to	examine	their	trunks	on	the	instant		
nor	was	his	behaviour	free	from	that	air	of	suspicion	which	a	man	puts	on	when	he	believes	himself	in	a	crowd	of	pickpockets	whom	his	caution	and	vigilance	set	at	defiance		
the	groans	and	music	were	occasionally	repeated	so	as	to	alarm	the	whole	family	and	inspire	a	thousand	various	conjectures		
for	once	my	penetration	hath	not	failed	me	your	behaviour	justifies	my	decision	you	have	treated	me	with	that	sympathy	and	respect	which	none	but	the	generous	will	pay	to	the	unfortunate		
though	no	person	ever	stood	more	in	need	of	a	companion	or	guard	and	her	heart	throbbed	with	transports	of	dismay	at	the	prospect	of	night	she	rejected	his	proposal	with	due	acknowledgment	and	resolved	to	trust	solely	to	the	protection	of	heaven		
it	was	in	consequence	of	this	plan	that	after	the	comedy	they	were	entertained	at	the	count	's	lodgings	where	quadrille	was	proposed	by	the	abbe	as	the	most	innocent	pastime	and	the	proposal	was	immediately	embraced	by	all	present	and	by	none	with	more	alacrity	than	by	our	adventurer	who	without	putting	forth	a	moiety	of	his	skill	went	home	with	twenty	louis	clear	gain		
although	this	kind	proffer	was	some	alleviation	of	her	misfortunes	she	did	not	fail	to	pour	forth	a	most	piteous	lamentation	importing	that	she	had	not	only	lost	all	her	money	amounting	to	five	pounds	but	also	her	letter	of	recommendation	upon	which	she	had	altogether	relied	for	present	employment		
the	french	troops	invested	fort	kehl	situated	on	the	rhine	opposite	to	strasburg	and	the	imperialists	dreading	that	the	next	storm	would	fall	upon	philipsburg	employed	themselves	with	great	diligence	to	put	that	important	fortress	in	a	proper	posture	of	defence		
but	sir	answered	the	impeacher	this	is	a	case	that	admits	of	no	delay	the	person	i	have	apprehended	is	a	prisoner	of	consequence	to	the	state		
the	young	count	subjected	himself	to	such	misinterpretation	among	those	who	observed	the	increased	warmth	of	civility	and	complaisance	in	his	behaviour	to	ferdinand		
however	mortified	m.	de	melvil	might	be	at	his	own	misfortune	the	condition	of	his	friend	seemed	to	touch	him	more	nearly	he	undervalued	his	own	loss	as	a	trifle	that	could	be	easily	repaired	said	everything	which	he	thought	would	tend	to	soothe	and	compose	the	agitation	of	ferdinand	and	finally	prevailed	upon	him	to	retire	to	rest		
she	had	in	good	sooth	long	sighed	in	secret	under	the	powerful	influence	of	his	charms	and	practised	upon	him	all	those	little	arts	by	which	a	woman	strives	to	attract	the	admiration	and	ensnare	the	heart	of	a	man	she	loves	but	all	his	faculties	were	employed	upon	the	plan	which	he	had	already	projected	that	was	the	goal	of	his	whole	attention	to	which	all	his	measures	tended	and	whether	or	not	he	perceived	the	impression	he	had	made	upon	teresa	he	never	gave	her	the	least	reason	to	believe	he	was	conscious	of	his	victory	until	he	found	himself	baffled	in	his	design	upon	the	heart	of	her	mistress	she	therefore	persevered	in	her	distant	attempts	to	allure	him	with	the	usual	coquetries	of	dress	and	address	and	in	the	sweet	hope	of	profiting	by	his	susceptibility	made	shift	to	suppress	her	feelings	and	keep	her	passion	within	bounds	until	his	supposed	danger	alarmed	her	fears	and	raised	such	a	tumult	within	her	breast	that	she	could	no	longer	conceal	her	love	but	gave	a	loose	to	her	sorrow	in	the	most	immoderate	expressions	of	anguish	and	affliction	and	while	his	delirium	lasted	behaved	with	all	the	agitation	of	a	despairing	shepherdess		
no	wonder	then	that	he	fell	a	prey	to	an	artful	gamester	who	had	been	regularly	trained	to	the	profession	and	made	it	the	sole	study	of	his	life	especially	as	the	hungarian	was	remarkable	for	a	warmth	of	temper	which	a	knight	of	the	post	always	knows	how	to	manage	for	his	own	advantage		
yes	don	diego	your	virtue	hath	triumphed	over	that	enmity	i	bore	your	house	and	i	upbraid	myself	with	the	ungenerous	treatment	you	have	suffered	under	my	command		
nevertheless	the	young	lady	vanquished	as	she	was	and	unskilled	in	the	ways	of	men	would	not	all	at	once	yield	at	discretion	but	insisted	upon	those	terms	without	which	no	woman	's	reputation	can	be	secured		
never	had	our	hero	spent	a	moment	in	such	agony	as	he	felt	during	this	operation	the	whole	surface	of	his	body	was	covered	with	a	cold	sweat	and	his	nerves	were	relaxed	with	an	universal	palsy		
what	were	his	reflections	when	in	lieu	of	mademoiselle	melvil	's	earrings	and	necklace	the	german	's	golden	chain	divers	jewels	of	considerable	value	the	spoils	of	sundry	dupes	and	about	two	hundred	ducats	in	ready	money	he	found	neither	more	nor	less	than	a	parcel	of	rusty	nails	disposed	in	such	a	manner	as	to	resemble	in	weight	and	bulk	the	moveables	he	had	lost		
this	is	altogether	great	solemn	and	amazing		
fathom	having	spent	the	night	in	more	effeminate	amusements	was	next	morning	so	much	hurried	for	want	of	time	that	in	his	transcription	he	neglected	to	insert	a	few	variations	from	the	text	these	being	the	terms	on	which	he	was	allowed	to	use	it	so	that	it	was	verbatim	a	copy	of	the	original		
my	charmer	while	my	head	retains	the	least	spark	of	invention	and	my	heart	glows	with	the	resolution	of	a	man	our	correspondence	shall	not	be	cut	off	by	the	machinations	of	an	envious	stepmother	who	never	had	attractions	to	inspire	a	generous	passion	and	now	that	age	and	wrinkles	have	destroyed	what	little	share	of	beauty	she	once	possessed	endeavours	like	the	fiend	in	paradise	to	blast	those	joys	in	others	from	which	she	is	herself	eternally	excluded		
while	i	was	thus	undeceived	in	my	conjecture	touching	his	birth	and	quality	i	was	confirmed	in	an	opinion	of	his	integrity	and	moderation	and	looked	upon	him	as	a	man	of	honour	in	despite	of	the	lowness	of	his	pedigree		
his	suspicion	being	thus	confined	within	his	own	house	sometimes	pitched	upon	his	workmen	and	sometimes	upon	his	wife	who	he	thought	was	the	more	likely	to	practise	such	finesse	as	she	considered	wilhelmina	in	the	light	of	a	daughterinlaw	whose	interest	interfered	with	her	own	and	who	had	often	harangued	to	him	in	private	on	the	folly	of	leaving	this	very	chain	in	the	young	lady	's	possession		
you	are	not	to	suppose	that	the	education	of	such	a	child	was	neglected		
he	listened	to	ferdinand	with	uncommon	regard	he	was	even	heard	to	commend	his	remarks	and	at	length	drank	to	their	better	acquaintance		
indeed	she	was	supplied	with	all	necessaries	by	the	generosity	of	this	noble	count	who	for	the	interest	of	his	passion	and	the	honour	of	his	name	was	resolved	to	extend	his	charity	to	the	last	farthing	of	her	own	money	which	he	had	been	wise	enough	to	secure	for	this	purpose		
she	immediately	justified	his	emotion	by	undergoing	the	same	alarm	and	without	further	hesitation	engaged	herself	in	the	search	beginning	with	a	song	which	might	be	compared	to	the	hymn	of	battle	among	the	greeks	or	rather	more	aptly	to	that	which	the	spartan	females	sung	round	the	altar	of	diana	surnamed	orthian	for	it	was	attended	with	strange	gesticulations	and	in	the	course	of	utterance	became	so	loud	and	shrill	that	the	guests	who	were	by	this	time	partly	assembled	being	confounded	at	the	clamour	rushed	towards	the	place	from	whence	it	seemed	to	proceed	and	found	their	landlord	with	his	wife	and	daughter	in	the	attitudes	of	distraction	and	despair		
our	hero	assured	him	in	the	french	language	that	he	was	falsely	impeached	and	demanded	justice	on	the	accuser	who	without	the	least	reason	had	made	such	a	malicious	attack	upon	the	life	and	honour	of	an	innocent	gentleman		
those	were	literally	tears	of	joy	or	at	least	of	satisfaction	on	both	sides	as	our	hero	wept	with	affection	and	attachment	to	the	jewels	that	were	to	be	committed	to	his	care	but	far	from	discovering	the	true	source	of	his	tenderness	he	affected	to	dissuade	the	spaniard	from	parting	with	the	diamonds	which	he	counselled	him	to	reserve	for	a	more	pressing	occasion	and	in	the	meantime	earnestly	entreated	him	to	depend	upon	his	friendship	for	present	relief		
she	was	not	backward	in	conveying	a	reply	to	this	expostulation	which	seemed	to	have	been	dictated	in	all	the	distraction	of	a	proud	woman	who	sees	her	vengeance	baffled	as	well	as	her	love	disdained		
she	very	graciously	consoled	our	gallant	for	the	mishap	of	which	he	complained	representing	wilhelmina	that	was	the	daughter	's	name	as	a	pert	illiterate	envious	baggage	of	whose	disgust	he	ought	to	make	no	consideration	then	she	recounted	many	instances	of	her	own	generosity	to	that	young	lady	with	the	returns	of	malice	and	ingratitude	she	had	made	and	lastly	enumerated	all	the	imperfections	of	her	person	education	and	behaviour	that	he	might	see	with	what	justice	the	gypsy	pretended	to	vie	with	those	who	had	been	distinguished	by	the	approbation	and	even	gallantry	of	the	best	people	in	vienna		
chapter	seven	engages	in	partnership	with	a	female	associate	in	order	to	put	his	talents	in	action		
the	german	thanked	him	for	this	proof	of	his	regard	which	yielded	him	more	satisfaction	on	account	of	the	chevalier	than	of	himself		
then	his	heart	began	to	palpitate	his	hair	to	bristle	up	and	his	knees	to	totter	his	thoughts	teemed	with	presages	of	death	and	destruction	his	conscience	rose	up	in	judgment	against	him	and	he	underwent	a	severe	paroxysm	of	dismay	and	distraction		
he	failed	not	to	continue	his	nocturnal	visits	and	ghastly	discourse	until	his	attendance	became	so	necessary	to	this	unhappy	maiden	that	she	durst	not	stay	in	her	own	chamber	without	his	company	nor	even	sleep	except	in	contact	with	her	betrayer		
nor	did	her	anxiety	abate	when	she	was	undeceived	in	this	her	supposition	and	understood	it	was	no	phantom	but	the	real	substance	of	the	stranger	who	without	staying	to	upbraid	her	with	the	enormity	of	her	crimes	commanded	her	on	pain	of	immediate	death	to	produce	his	horse	to	which	being	conducted	he	set	her	upon	the	saddle	without	delay	and	mounting	behind	invested	her	with	the	management	of	the	reins	swearing	in	a	most	peremptory	tone	that	the	only	chance	she	had	for	her	life	was	in	directing	him	safely	to	the	next	town	and	that	so	soon	as	she	should	give	him	the	least	cause	to	doubt	her	fidelity	in	the	performance	of	that	task	he	would	on	the	instant	act	the	part	of	her	executioner		
with	what	transport	then	shall	i	obey	your	summons	in	performing	that	enterprise	which	will	rescue	you	from	the	bed	of	a	detested	rival	and	put	myself	in	full	possession	of	a	jewel	which	i	value	infinitely	more	than	life		
fathom	having	thus	found	an	interpreter	who	signified	to	him	in	the	french	tongue	the	doubts	of	the	justice	told	his	lordship	that	he	was	a	gentleman	of	a	noble	house	in	germany	who	for	certain	reasons	had	come	abroad	incognito	with	a	view	to	see	the	world	and	that	although	the	letters	they	had	seized	would	prove	the	truth	of	that	assertion	he	should	be	loth	to	expose	his	private	concerns	to	the	knowledge	of	strangers	if	he	could	possibly	be	released	without	that	mortification		
chapter	sixteen	his	success	begets	a	blind	security	by	which	he	is	once	again	wellnigh	entrapped	in	his	dulcinea	's	apartment		
the	clock	strikes	one	the	symphony	hath	ceased		
he	pledged	the	german	in	every	bumper	flattered	the	hollander	with	compliments	upon	the	industry	wealth	and	policy	of	the	seven	united	provinces	but	he	reserved	his	chief	battery	for	his	own	countryman	on	the	supposition	that	he	was	in	all	respects	the	best	adapted	for	the	purposes	of	a	needy	gamester		
whatever	interest	i	have	at	court	shall	be	employed	in	your	behalf	and	i	have	other	designs	in	your	favour	which	shall	be	disclosed	in	due	season		
among	those	who	felicitated	fathom	upon	the	issue	of	this	adventure	the	young	maiden	seemed	to	express	the	most	sensible	pleasure	at	that	event		
all	principles	of	morality	had	been	already	excluded	from	their	former	plan	consequently	he	found	it	an	easy	task	to	interest	teresa	in	any	other	scheme	tending	to	their	mutual	advantage	howsoever	wicked	and	perfidious	it	might	be		
here	this	excellent	actor	began	to	sob	most	piteously	and	the	tenderhearted	wilhelmina	unable	longer	to	withstand	his	moving	tale	with	a	repetition	of	the	interjection	ah		
over	and	above	the	accomplishments	of	address	for	which	he	hath	been	already	celebrated	he	excelled	all	his	fellows	in	his	dexterity	at	fives	and	billiards	was	altogether	unrivalled	in	his	skill	at	draughts	and	backgammon	began	even	at	these	years	to	understand	the	moves	and	schemes	of	chess	and	made	himself	a	mere	adept	in	the	mystery	of	cards	which	he	learned	in	the	course	of	his	assiduities	and	attention	to	the	females	of	the	house		
replied	the	german	in	a	terrible	accent	open	the	door	this	instant	there	is	a	man	in	your	bedchamber	and	by	the	lightning	and	thunder		
that	he	might	now	act	consistent	with	his	former	sagacity	he	resolved	to	pass	himself	upon	his	fellowtravellers	for	a	french	gentleman	equally	a	stranger	to	the	language	and	country	of	england	in	order	to	glean	from	their	discourse	such	intelligence	as	might	avail	him	in	his	future	operations	and	his	lacquey	was	tutored	accordingly		
has	he	got	no	secret	arms	about	him		
there	being	no	longer	room	for	suspicion	the	justice	ordered	our	adventurer	to	be	set	at	liberty	and	even	invited	him	to	be	seated	with	an	apology	for	the	rude	manner	in	which	he	had	been	treated	owing	to	the	misinformation	of	the	accuser	who	was	threatened	with	the	stocks	for	his	malice	and	presumption		
this	circumstance	was	not	unknown	to	his	lady	by	whose	express	approbation	he	had	bestowed	particular	attention	upon	the	education	of	the	child	whom	we	shall	distinguish	by	the	name	of	celinda		
this	phenomenon	made	such	an	impression	upon	the	astonished	chevalier	already	discomposed	by	the	resolute	behaviour	of	the	count	that	he	became	jaundiced	with	terror	and	dismay	and	while	his	teeth	chattered	in	his	head	told	our	hero	he	had	hoped	from	his	known	politeness	to	have	found	him	ready	to	acknowledge	an	injury	which	might	have	been	the	effect	of	anger	or	misapprehension	in	which	case	the	affair	might	have	been	compromised	to	their	mutual	satisfaction	without	proceeding	to	those	extremities	which	among	men	of	honour	are	always	accounted	the	last	resource		
ecod		
cried	he	my	neighbour	sir	giles	squirrel	as	i	am	a	living	soul		
he	was	rejoiced	to	find	her	so	easily	satisfied	in	such	a	momentous	concern	for	the	principal	aim	of	the	intrigue	was	to	make	her	necessary	to	his	interested	views	and	even	if	possible	an	associate	in	the	fraudulent	plans	he	had	projected	upon	her	father	consequently	he	considered	this	relaxation	in	her	virtue	as	an	happy	omen	of	his	future	success		
upon	which	the	other	produced	ferdinand	's	billet	and	threatened	in	very	high	terms	to	meet	the	stripling	according	to	his	invitation	and	chastise	him	severely	for	his	presumption		
after	having	for	some	time	indulged	these	prospects	in	secret	he	determined	to	accommodate	himself	with	the	company	and	experience	of	the	tyrolese	whom	under	the	specious	title	of	an	associate	he	knew	he	could	convert	into	a	very	serviceable	tool	in	forwarding	the	execution	of	his	own	projects		
fools	of	each	fabric	sharpers	of	all	sorts	and	dunces	of	every	degree	profess	themselves	of	both	orders		
our	hero	conformed	himself	in	all	respects	to	the	other	's	opinions	and	managed	his	discretion	so	as	to	pass	upon	him	for	a	gentleman	reduced	by	misfortunes	to	the	exercise	of	an	employment	which	was	altogether	unsuitable	to	his	birth	and	quality		
be	this	as	it	will	our	lovers	though	real	voluptuaries	amidst	the	first	transports	of	their	enjoyment	did	not	neglect	the	great	political	aim	of	their	conjunction		
if	he	exhibited	such	a	proof	of	sagacity	in	the	twelfth	year	of	his	age	what	might	not	be	expected	from	his	finesse	in	the	maturity	of	his	faculties	and	experience		
notwithstanding	this	exemption	from	all	duty	our	adventurer	managed	matters	so	as	to	pass	for	a	youth	of	infinite	mettle	and	even	rendered	his	backwardness	and	timidity	subservient	to	the	support	of	that	character	by	expressing	an	impatience	of	lying	inactive	and	a	desire	of	signalising	his	prowess	which	even	the	disabled	condition	of	his	body	could	scarce	restrain		
what	upon	a	less	interesting	occasion	his	imagination	durst	not	propose	he	now	executed	without	scruple	or	remorse		
he	was	not	so	smitten	with	the	delightful	situation	of	this	ancient	town	but	that	he	abandoned	it	as	soon	as	he	could	procure	a	postchaise	in	which	he	arrived	at	paris	without	having	been	exposed	to	any	other	troublesome	adventure	upon	the	road		
then	rushing	upon	him	in	a	transport	of	fury	i	plunged	my	sword	into	his	heart	crying	villain		
it	was	not	long	after	this	celebrated	victory	that	he	was	invited	to	spend	part	of	the	summer	at	the	house	of	a	country	gentleman	who	lived	about	one	hundred	miles	from	london	possessed	of	a	very	opulent	fortune	the	greatest	part	of	which	was	expended	in	acts	of	old	english	hospitality		
here	's	a	piece	of	carrion	that	i	would	not	offer	to	e'er	a	hound	in	my	kennel	tis	enough	to	make	any	christian	vomit	both	gut	and	gall	and	indeed	by	the	wry	faces	he	made	while	he	ran	to	the	door	his	stomach	seemed	ready	to	justify	this	last	assertion		
the	first	use	he	made	of	this	vehicle	was	that	of	visiting	the	young	nobleman	from	whom	he	had	received	such	important	civilities	on	the	road	in	consequence	of	an	invitation	at	parting	by	which	he	learned	his	title	and	the	place	of	his	abode	in	london		
notwithstanding	these	repeated	declarations	ferdinand	who	was	well	enough	acquainted	with	the	mind	of	man	to	know	that	such	importunity	is	seldom	or	never	disagreeable	redoubled	his	instances	together	with	his	expressions	of	sympathy	and	esteem	until	the	stranger	was	prevailed	upon	to	gratify	his	curiosity	and	benevolence		
chapter	fifteen	but	at	length	succeeds	in	his	attempt	upon	both		
he	and	our	adventurer	had	been	fellowlodgers	for	some	time	and	according	to	the	laudable	custom	in	these	days	had	hitherto	remained	as	much	estranged	to	one	another	as	if	they	had	lived	on	opposite	sides	of	the	globe	but	of	late	the	persian	seemed	to	regard	our	hero	with	particular	attention	when	they	chanced	to	meet	on	the	staircase	or	elsewhere	he	bowed	to	ferdinand	with	great	solemnity	and	complimented	him	with	the	pas		
among	other	preceptors	it	was	her	fate	to	be	under	the	instruction	of	a	cursed	german	who	though	his	profession	was	drawing	understood	the	elements	and	theory	of	music	possessed	a	large	fund	of	learning	and	taste	and	was	a	person	remarkable	for	his	agreeable	conversation		
nevertheless	perceiving	the	virago	approach	with	fell	intent	he	brandished	his	symitar	and	tried	to	intimidate	his	assailant	with	a	most	horrible	exclamation	but	it	was	not	the	dismal	yell	of	a	dismounted	cavalier	though	enforced	with	a	hideous	ferocity	of	countenance	and	the	menacing	gestures	with	which	he	waited	her	approach	that	could	intimidate	such	an	undaunted	shecampaigner	she	saw	him	writhing	in	the	agonies	of	a	situation	from	which	he	could	not	move	and	running	towards	him	with	the	nimbleness	and	intrepidity	of	a	camilla	described	a	semicircle	in	the	progress	of	her	assault	and	attacking	him	on	one	side	plunged	her	welltried	dagger	in	his	throat		
the	smuggler	instead	of	acting	the	part	of	a	faithful	interpreter	told	his	worship	that	the	prisoner	's	answer	was	no	more	than	a	simple	denial	which	every	felon	would	make	who	had	nothing	else	to	plead	in	his	own	behalf	and	that	this	alone	was	a	strong	presumption	of	his	guilt	because	if	he	was	not	really	the	person	they	suspected	him	to	be	the	thing	would	speak	for	itself	for	if	he	was	not	the	young	pretender	who	then	was	he		
he	was	blooded	vomited	purged	and	blistered	in	the	usual	forms	for	the	physicians	of	hungary	are	generally	as	well	skilled	in	the	arts	of	their	occupation	as	any	other	leeches	under	the	sun	and	swallowed	a	whole	dispensary	of	bolusses	draughts	and	apozems	by	which	means	he	became	fairly	delirious	in	three	days	and	so	untractable	that	he	could	be	no	longer	managed	according	to	rule	otherwise	in	all	likelihood	the	world	would	never	have	enjoyed	the	benefit	of	these	adventures		
in	an	honourable	cause	i	despise	all	danger	my	courage	thank	heaven		
all	these	gratifications	he	received	with	demonstrations	of	infinite	constraint	and	reluctance	and	in	the	midst	of	his	rapacious	extortion	acted	so	cunningly	as	to	impose	himself	upon	both	for	a	miracle	of	disinterested	integrity		
indeed	i	look	upon	this	opulent	kingdom	as	a	wide	and	fertile	common	on	which	we	adventurers	may	range	for	prey	without	let	or	molestation		
ferdinand	for	some	time	had	no	reason	to	be	dissatisfied	with	this	disposition	by	which	he	was	at	once	delivered	from	the	fatigues	of	a	campaign	and	the	inspection	of	a	severe	censor	in	the	person	of	count	melvil	and	his	satisfaction	was	still	increased	by	an	accidental	meeting	with	the	tyrolese	who	had	been	his	confederate	at	vienna	and	now	chanced	to	serve	in	garrison	on	the	same	footing	with	himself		
any	man	of	humane	sentiments	from	the	knowledge	of	these	particulars	would	have	been	prompted	to	offer	his	services	to	the	forlorn	stranger	but	as	our	hero	was	devoid	of	all	these	infirmities	of	human	nature	it	was	necessary	that	other	motives	should	produce	the	same	effect		
the	young	lady	who	little	thought	that	her	papa	would	have	taken	her	at	her	word	was	overwhelmed	with	confusion	and	dismay	when	she	saw	him	enter	the	closet	and	had	her	lover	been	discovered	would	in	all	probability	have	been	the	loudest	in	his	reproach	and	perhaps	have	accused	him	of	an	intention	to	rob	the	house	but	she	was	altogether	astonished	when	she	found	he	had	made	shift	to	elude	the	inquiry	of	her	parents	because	she	could	not	conceive	the	possibility	of	his	escaping	by	the	window	which	was	in	the	third	storey	at	a	prodigious	distance	from	the	ground	and	how	he	should	conceal	himself	in	the	apartment	was	a	mystery	which	she	could	by	no	means	unfold		
he	was	not	however	long	amused	by	these	vain	chimeras	which	soon	vanished	before	other	reflections	of	more	importance	and	solidity		
the	italian	and	the	abbe	were	the	first	who	began	to	grow	whimsical	under	the	influence	of	the	burgundy	and	in	the	heat	of	their	elevation	proposed	that	the	company	should	amuse	themselves	during	the	remaining	part	of	the	night	at	the	house	of	an	obliging	dame	who	maintained	a	troop	of	fair	nymphs	for	the	accommodation	of	the	other	sex		
after	supper	don	diego	walked	a	minuet	with	madam	clement	for	whom	by	this	time	he	had	contracted	an	extraordinary	degree	of	affection		
during	this	declaration	which	was	pronounced	in	the	most	emphatic	manner	monimia	was	successively	agitated	with	shame	anger	and	grief	nevertheless	she	summoned	her	whole	philosophy	to	her	aid	and	with	a	tranquil	though	determined	air	begged	he	would	not	diminish	the	obligations	he	had	already	conferred	by	disturbing	with	such	unseasonable	addresses	a	poor	unhappy	maid	who	had	detached	all	her	thoughts	from	earthly	objects	and	waited	impatiently	for	that	dissolution	which	alone	could	put	a	period	to	her	misfortunes		
were	her	last	moments	comfortless		
what	would	be	his	penance	had	he	my	cause		
i	am	a	judge	of	your	feelings	because	i	know	the	value	of	your	loss		
you	must	know	that	teresa	who	attended	me	from	my	childhood	and	in	whose	honesty	i	reposed	such	confidence	having	disobliged	some	of	the	inferior	servants	was	so	narrowly	watched	in	all	her	transactions	as	to	be	at	last	detected	in	the	very	act	of	conveying	a	piece	of	plate	which	was	actually	found	concealed	among	her	clothes		
but	when	he	found	her	disposed	to	listen	to	this	last	suggestion	he	destroyed	the	force	of	it	by	recollecting	the	circumstances	of	his	nocturnal	rambles	which	he	owned	would	admit	of	no	favourable	construction		
in	this	deplorable	condition	he	was	found	by	our	adventurer	who	gently	chid	him	for	his	want	of	resolution	and	again	repelled	his	sorrow	by	arousing	his	resentment	against	the	innocent	cause	of	his	disquiet	having	beforehand	forged	the	particulars	of	provocation		
elevated	by	these	expectations	he	one	day	in	the	midst	of	a	preconcerted	rhapsody	importing	that	he	could	no	longer	conceal	the	fire	that	preyed	upon	his	heart	threw	himself	on	his	knees	before	the	lovely	mourner	and	imprinted	a	kiss	on	her	fair	hand		
renaldo	's	grief	and	mortification	at	this	disappointment	were	unspeakable		
for	the	shot	entering	the	count	's	right	breast	made	its	way	to	the	backbone	with	such	a	shock	as	struck	him	to	the	ground	upon	which	the	other	alighted	in	order	to	improve	the	advantage	he	had	gained		
there	was	nothing	remarkable	in	the	habit	of	renaldo	who	had	copied	the	plainness	and	elegance	of	his	mistress	but	when	she	entered	the	place	his	features	were	animated	with	a	double	proportion	of	vivacity	and	their	eyes	meeting	seemed	to	kindle	a	blaze	which	diffused	warmth	and	joy	through	the	countenances	of	all	present		
melvil	was	not	slow	in	returning	the	compliment	which	as	it	was	deliberate	proved	the	more	decisive		
inexpressible	was	the	rage	of	mendoza	when	he	heard	of	their	elopement		
what	simile	shall	i	find	to	illustrate	the	character	of	the	sex		
when	a	physician	becomes	the	town	talk	he	generally	concludes	his	business	more	than	half	done	even	though	his	fame	should	wholly	turn	upon	his	malpractice	insomuch	that	some	members	of	the	faculty	have	been	heard	to	complain	that	they	never	had	the	good	fortune	to	be	publicly	accused	of	homicide	and	it	is	well	known	that	a	certain	famous	empiric	of	our	day	never	flourished	to	any	degree	of	wealth	and	reputation	till	after	he	had	been	attacked	in	print	and	fairly	convicted	of	having	destroyed	a	good	number	of	the	human	species		
a	chariot	was	not	now	set	up	for	the	convenience	of	a	man	sinking	under	the	fatigue	of	extensive	practice	but	as	a	piece	of	furniture	every	way	as	necessary	as	a	large	periwig	with	three	tails	and	a	physician	let	his	merit	in	other	respects	be	never	so	conspicuous	can	no	more	expect	to	become	considerable	in	business	without	the	assistance	of	this	implement	than	he	can	hope	to	live	without	food	or	breathe	without	a	windpipe		
his	mien	and	deportment	produced	a	prepossession	in	his	favour	and	the	air	of	affliction	so	remarkable	in	his	visage	did	not	fail	to	attract	their	sympathy	and	observation		
that	shall	be	my	task	cried	renaldo	but	first	permit	me	to	implore	your	sanction	to	my	passion	for	the	incomparable	serafina		
nothing	so	effectually	blunts	the	shafts	of	ridicule	and	defeats	the	aims	of	slander	as	this	method	of	anticipation		
and	caught	in	his	arms	not	the	shadow	but	the	warm	substance	of	the	allaccomplished	monimia		
well	then	resumed	the	major	i	will	deal	with	you	like	a	downright	swiss	and	point	out	a	method	by	which	you	may	shift	the	load	of	obligation	from	your	own	shoulders	to	mine		
when	she	heard	that	instead	of	betraying	the	least	symptom	of	regret	or	compassion	for	her	unhappy	fate	the	perfidious	youth	had	exulted	over	her	fall	and	even	made	her	a	subject	for	his	mirth	the	blood	revisited	her	faded	cheeks	and	resentment	restored	to	her	eyes	that	poignancy	which	sorrow	had	before	overcome		
finding	himself	thus	driven	to	bay	he	leaped	upon	the	ground	and	exercised	his	weapon	with	such	amazing	strength	and	agility	that	several	of	his	antagonists	were	left	motionless	on	the	field	before	he	was	overpowered	and	disarmed	by	dint	of	numbers	who	assailed	him	on	all	sides		
or	apollo	with	a	trowel		
renaldo	was	pleased	with	the	frankness	of	this	declaration	approved	of	his	demand	and	desired	him	to	depend	upon	his	good	offices	with	his	sister	whom	he	sounded	that	same	evening	upon	the	subject	recommending	the	major	to	her	favour	as	a	gentleman	well	worthy	of	her	choice		
the	hungarian	was	so	much	confounded	at	this	unexpected	reception	that	he	had	not	power	to	thank	the	merchant	for	his	promised	favour	but	stood	motionless	and	silent	while	the	streams	of	emotion	of	the	heart	was	of	more	weight	with	the	jew	than	the	eloquent	acknowledgment	which	ferdinand	took	the	opportunity	of	making	for	his	friend	and	he	was	fain	to	dismiss	them	a	little	abruptly	in	order	to	prevent	a	second	discharge	of	that	same	rheum	of	which	he	had	already	complained		
with	that	complacency	and	fortitude	which	were	peculiar	to	herself	this	hapless	stranger	resisted	all	those	artful	temptations		
i	will	rather	sacrifice	her	to	my	just	resentment	to	the	injured	powers	of	love	and	friendship		
he	explained	the	nature	of	the	robbery	which	was	supposed	to	have	been	done	by	the	count	's	valet	together	with	the	manner	of	their	desertion		
besides	the	prospect	of	this	gloomy	enjoyment	he	was	urged	to	return	to	england	by	an	eager	desire	of	taking	vengeance	on	the	perfidious	fathom	as	well	as	of	acquitting	himself	of	the	obligations	he	owed	in	that	kingdom	to	those	who	had	assisted	him	in	his	distress		
at	the	same	time	don	diego	was	summoned	to	present	himself	before	the	king	within	a	limited	time	to	answer	to	the	charge	which	mendoza	had	brought	against	him		
so	saying	he	fell	backwards	in	a	swoon	from	which	he	was	with	difficulty	recovered	to	the	sensation	of	the	most	exquisite	torments		
he	was	not	slow	of	availing	himself	of	this	permission		
i	attended	the	incomparable	monimia	in	her	last	illness	and	am	well	enough	acquainted	with	her	story	to	conclude	that	she	fell	a	sacrifice	to	an	unhappy	misunderstanding	effected	and	fomented	by	that	traitor	who	abused	your	mutual	confidence		
she	has	for	some	months	been	solicited	in	marriage	by	an	honest	citizen	a	thirty	thousand	pound	man	and	instead	of	listening	to	such	an	advantageous	proposal	she	hath	bestowed	her	heart	upon	a	young	fellow	not	worth	a	groat		
success	raised	upon	such	a	foundation	would	by	a	disciple	of	plato	and	some	modern	moralists	be	ascribed	to	the	innate	virtue	and	generosity	of	the	human	heart	which	naturally	espouses	the	cause	that	needs	protection		
forgive	my	transports	madam	i	can	not	help	seeing	and	admiring	such	divine	attractions		
the	usurer	professed	himself	sorry	that	it	was	not	in	his	power	to	oblige	him	and	in	order	to	prevent	any	further	importunity	assured	them	he	had	laid	it	down	as	a	maxim	from	which	he	would	never	swerve	to	avoid	all	dealings	with	people	whom	if	need	should	be	he	could	not	sue	by	the	laws	of	this	realm		
his	heart	being	thus	disburdened	and	his	impatience	gratified	he	became	so	calm	and	composed	that	don	diego	was	equally	pleased	and	astonished	at	the	air	of	serenity	with	which	he	came	forth	and	embraced	him	with	warm	acknowledgments	of	his	goodness	and	attachment		
in	spite	of	these	suggestions	which	were	not	at	all	mitigated	by	the	forbidding	aspect	of	the	hebrew	he	demanded	a	private	audience	and	being	ushered	into	another	apartment	he	explained	his	business	with	manifest	marks	of	disorder	and	affliction		
madam	clement	thus	cautioned	entered	into	deliberation	with	her	own	thoughts	and	comparing	the	particulars	of	this	account	with	those	of	monimia	's	own	story	she	concluded	that	fathom	was	the	very	traitor	he	himself	had	described	and	that	he	had	by	abusing	the	confidence	of	both	effected	a	fatal	breach	between	two	innocent	and	deserving	lovers		
yet	the	fever	abated	and	in	two	days	she	retrieved	the	use	of	her	reason	though	the	distemper	had	affected	her	lungs	and	she	was	in	all	appearance	doomed	to	linger	a	few	weeks	longer	in	a	consumption		
the	doctor	who	has	traced	him	in	all	his	conduct	and	vicissitudes	of	fortune	will	draw	a	picture	of	his	present	wretchedness	which	i	doubt	not	will	move	your	compassion	as	it	hath	already	excited	mine		
this	is	rapture	ecstasy	and	what	no	language	can	explain		
she	never	went	abroad	except	in	visits	to	a	french	chapel	in	the	neighbourhood	she	refused	the	proffered	assistance	of	our	adventurer	with	equal	obstinacy	and	politeness	and	with	pleasure	saw	herself	wasting	towards	that	period	of	mortality	which	was	the	consummation	of	her	wish		
but	when	he	reflected	how	her	tender	heart	must	have	been	wrung	with	anguish	at	his	unkindness	and	cruelty	in	leaving	her	destitute	in	a	foreign	land	how	her	sensibility	must	have	been	tortured	in	finding	herself	altogether	dependent	upon	a	ruffian	who	certainly	harboured	the	most	baleful	designs	upon	her	honour	how	her	life	must	be	endangered	both	by	his	barbarity	and	her	own	despairi	say	when	he	reflected	on	these	circumstances	he	shuddered	with	horror	and	dismay	and	that	very	night	despatched	a	letter	to	his	friend	the	jew	entreating	him	in	the	most	pressing	manner	to	employ	all	his	intelligence	in	learning	the	situation	of	the	fair	orphan	that	she	might	be	protected	from	the	villany	of	fathom	until	his	return	to	england		
his	servants	would	have	interposed	but	he	commanded	them	to	retire	and	flushed	with	that	confidence	which	the	impetuosity	of	his	temper	inspired	he	drew	in	his	turn	and	attacked	me	with	redoubled	rage	but	his	dexterity	being	very	unequal	to	his	courage	he	was	soon	disarmed	and	overthrown	when	pointing	my	sword	to	his	breast	in	consideration	of	thy	youth	and	ignorance	said	i	i	spare	that	life	which	thou	hast	forfeited	by	thy	ungenerous	presumption		
her	father	no	sooner	entered	the	apartment	than	he	was	known	by	joshua	to	be	a	considerable	trader	in	the	city	of	london	and	the	merchant	was	glad	to	find	himself	among	his	acquaintance		
melvil	whose	passions	were	still	in	agitation	and	whose	mind	could	not	yet	digest	the	incidents	that	occurred	embraced	them	all	by	turns	but	like	the	faithful	needle	which	though	shaken	for	an	instant	from	its	poise	immediately	regains	its	true	direction	and	points	invariably	to	the	pole	he	soon	returned	to	his	monimia	again	he	held	her	in	his	arms	again	he	drank	enchantment	from	her	eyes	and	thus	poured	forth	the	effusions	of	his	soul:"can	i	then	trust	the	evidence	of	sense		
by	these	means	he	blew	the	coals	of	her	jealousy	and	enhanced	the	value	of	his	own	character	at	the	same	time	for	she	looked	upon	him	as	a	mirror	of	faith	and	integrity	and	the	mind	being	overcharged	with	woe	naturally	seeks	some	confidant	upon	whose	sympathy	it	can	repose	itself		
mysterious	powers	of	providence		
notwithstanding	these	reflections	he	would	not	lay	aside	an	idea	which	so	agreeably	flattered	his	imagination		
the	majordomo	having	waited	several	hours	for	his	lord	's	return	without	seeing	him	appear	thought	proper	to	despatch	a	messenger	to	don	manuel	with	an	account	of	what	had	happened	and	that	nobleman	arriving	in	the	morning	took	possession	of	the	house		
they	recounted	to	her	the	adventure	of	last	night	which	she	explained	by	informing	them	of	the	letters	which	don	diego	had	intercepted		
nevertheless	he	was	very	much	mistaken	in	reckoning	on	the	importance	of	his	new	ally	who	was	like	himself	a	needy	adventurer	settled	upon	credit	and	altogether	unemployed	except	among	the	very	refuse	of	the	people	whom	no	other	person	would	take	the	trouble	to	attend		
melvil	having	signified	his	request	young	gentleman	said	the	israelite	with	a	most	discordant	voice	what	in	the	name	of	goodness	could	induce	you	to	come	to	me	upon	such	an	errand		
had	your	actions	been	always	regulated	by	the	dictates	of	honour	replied	renaldo	i	should	never	have	been	questioned	for	riding	round	that	castle	which	you	know	is	my	rightful	inheritance	or	excluded	from	the	sight	of	a	parent	who	suffers	under	your	tyranny	and	oppression		
then	turning	to	the	bystanders	with	a	bloodshot	eye	said	leave	me	to	the	full	enjoyment	of	this	occasion	my	grief	is	too	delicate	to	admit	the	company	even	of	my	friends		
such	indeed	was	their	eagerness	to	see	them	that	some	lives	were	endangered	by	the	pressure	of	the	crowd	which	attended	them	with	loud	acclamations	to	the	coach	after	the	bridegroom	had	deposited	in	the	hands	of	the	minister	one	hundred	pounds	for	the	benefit	of	the	poor	of	that	parish	and	thrown	several	handfuls	of	money	among	the	multitude		
then	he	proceeded	to	give	a	regular	detail	of	all	the	strokes	of	finesse	which	he	in	conjunction	with	our	adventurer	had	practised	upon	melvil	and	others	during	their	residence	at	vienna	and	the	campaigns	they	had	made	upon	the	rhine		
yet	even	this	branch	was	already	overstocked	insomuch	that	almost	every	street	was	furnished	with	one	of	these	charitable	receptacles	which	instead	of	diminishing	the	taxes	for	the	maintenance	of	the	poor	encouraged	the	vulgar	to	be	idle	and	dissolute	by	opening	an	asylum	to	them	and	their	families	from	the	diseases	of	poverty	and	intemperance		
you	degenerate	hussy	this	comes	of	your	plays	and	romances		
this	peremptory	language	had	an	instantaneous	effect	upon	the	hearers		
so	it	fared	with	our	adventurer	in	his	new	occupation		
such	are	the	heirs	and	representatives	of	those	patriots	who	planned	and	those	heroes	who	maintained	the	laws	and	freedom	of	their	country	who	were	the	patrons	of	merit	the	fathers	of	the	poor	the	terror	of	vice	and	immorality	and	at	once	the	ornaments	and	support	of	a	happy	nation		
he	had	often	repeated	such	apostrophes	as	these	which	she	ascribed	to	nothing	else	than	sheer	benevolence	and	virtuous	indignation	and	actually	began	to	think	he	had	made	some	impression	upon	her	heart	not	that	he	now	entertained	the	hope	of	an	immediate	triumph	over	her	chastity		
when	a	woman	's	heart	is	once	depraved	she	bids	adieu	to	all	restraint;she	preserves	no	measures

farrel	was	accordingly	introduced	in	the	character	of	a	lover	after	the	permission	of	the	countess	had	been	obtained	and	he	carried	on	his	addresses	in	the	usual	form	so	much	to	the	satisfaction	of	all	concerned	in	the	event	that	a	day	was	appointed	for	the	celebration	of	his	nuptials	when	he	entered	into	peaceable	possession	of	his	prize

to	his	view	thus	strained	upon	vacant	space	in	a	few	minutes	appeared	the	figure	of	a	woman	arrayed	in	white	with	a	veil	that	covered	her	face	and	flowed	down	upon	her	back	and	shoulders		
chapter	fiftyseven	fathom	being	safely	housed	the	reader	is	entertained	with	a	retrospect
