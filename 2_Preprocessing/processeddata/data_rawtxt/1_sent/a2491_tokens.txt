fraulein	rottenmeier	took	the	seat	beside	her	and	made	a	sign	to	heidi	to	take	the	one	opposite		
then	she	let	the	child	go	and	heidi	ran	into	the	next	room	and	bid	peter	come	quickly	for	it	had	now	grown	quite	dark		
heidi	climbed	up	the	steep	path	from	dorfli	as	quickly	as	she	could	she	was	obliged	however	to	pause	now	and	again	to	take	breath	for	the	basket	she	carried	was	rather	heavy	and	the	way	got	steeper	as	she	drew	nearer	the	top		
during	the	first	few	days	that	this	happened	every	room	and	corner	was	searched	in	great	alarm	to	see	if	anything	had	been	stolen	for	the	general	idea	was	that	a	thief	had	been	hiding	in	the	house	and	had	gone	off	in	the	night	with	the	stolen	goods	but	not	a	thing	in	the	house	had	been	touched	everything	was	safe	in	its	place		
clara	immediately	screamed	out	that	she	could	not	remain	another	minute	alone	her	father	must	come	home	and	fraulein	rottenmeier	must	sleep	in	her	room	at	night	and	heidi	too	must	not	be	left	by	herself	for	the	ghost	might	do	something	to	her		
they	started	talking	again		
here	's	a	state	of	things		
heidi	ran	back	quickly	and	gave	peter	her	hand	promising	to	go	with	him	and	then	making	her	way	through	the	goats	she	once	more	clasped	snowflake	round	the	neck	saying	in	a	gentle	soothing	voice	sleep	well	snowflake	and	remember	that	i	shall	be	with	you	again	tomorrow	so	you	must	not	bleat	so	sadly	any	more		
so	the	autumn	and	winter	passed	and	again	the	sun	came	shining	down	on	the	white	walls	of	the	opposite	houses	and	heidi	would	think	to	herself	that	now	the	time	had	come	for	peter	to	go	out	again	with	the	goats	to	where	the	golden	flowers	of	the	cistus	were	glowing	in	the	sunlight	and	all	the	rocks	around	turned	to	fire	at	sunset		
no	she	always	gives	it	back	to	peter	telling	him	it	is	too	hard	for	i	have	seen	her	do	it	myself	affirmed	heidi		
brigitta	went	with	her	to	the	door	and	there	said	in	rather	a	mysterious	voice	you	might	have	kept	on	your	dress	he	would	have	known	you	all	right	but	you	must	be	careful	for	peter	tells	me	that	almuncle	is	always	now	in	a	bad	temper	and	never	speaks		
did	you	see	any	other		
peter	now	understood	the	drift	of	the	old	man	's	questions	and	that	he	was	the	boy	who	behaved	like	the	unruly	goats	and	he	looked	somewhat	fearfully	towards	the	corner	to	see	if	anything	happened	to	be	there	such	as	he	used	himself	on	such	occasions	for	the	punishment	of	his	animals		
who	is	the	old	goat		
peter	looked	towards	the	cupboard	where	the	bread	and	cheese	were	kept	and	said	crossly	i	never	said	that	i	should	forget	the	x.		
tinette	disappeared	but	soon	came	back	and	called	down	again	to	dete	come	up	she	is	expecting	you		
he	thought	his	eyes	must	deceive	him	and	yet	there	she	was	and	no	mistake	about	it		
then	herr	sesemann	returned	to	clara	and	begged	her	to	have	no	more	fear	as	he	would	soon	find	out	all	about	the	ghost	and	put	an	end	to	it		
child	what	does	this	mean		
do	what	peter		
you	must	milk	two	bowlfuls	for	her	when	she	has	her	dinner	for	she	is	going	with	you	and	will	remain	with	you	till	you	return	this	evening	but	take	care	she	does	not	fall	over	any	of	the	rocks	do	you	hear		
in	the	large	space	between	the	stove	and	the	wall	four	planks	had	been	put	together	as	if	to	make	a	large	receptacle	for	apples	there	were	no	apples	however	inside	but	something	heidi	had	no	difficulty	in	recognising	for	it	was	her	very	own	bed	with	its	hay	mattress	and	sheets	and	sack	for	a	coverlid	just	as	she	had	it	up	at	the	hut		
i	will	begin	by	explaining	to	you	how	you	are	to	conduct	yourself	at	table	and	she	went	on	to	give	heidi	minute	instructions	as	to	all	she	was	to	do		
she	would	run	away	repeatedly	from	whatever	she	might	be	doing	to	listen	to	them	for	nothing	seemed	so	strange	and	wonderful	to	her	as	the	deep	mysterious	sound	in	the	tops	of	the	trees		
grandfather	you	will	be	able	to	do	something	wo	n't	you	so	that	it	need	not	be	as	clara	says	and	so	that	she	is	not	obliged	to	go	home		
no	i	would	rather	not	replied	heidi	firmly		
and	heidi	took	the	rolls	from	the	basket	and	piled	the	whole	twelve	up	on	grandmother	's	lap		
what	is	the	matter		
oh	no	grandfather	we	can	go	back	for	grandmamma	told	me	so	and	so	it	was	in	the	beautiful	tale	in	my	bookbut	you	have	not	heard	that	yet	but	we	shall	be	home	directly	now	and	then	i	will	read	it	you	and	you	will	see	how	beautiful	it	is		
she	had	quite	expected	a	long	and	private	account	of	some	terrible	ghostly	experience	of	his	during	the	night	which	she	would	have	enjoyed	hearing	about	in	the	broad	daylight		
am	i	not	right	general		
exclaimed	the	grandmother	in	surprise		
the	sun	is	up		
this	foe	was	indeed	the	prospect	of	the	arrival	of	the	frankfurt	visitors	the	thought	of	whom	filled	him	with	exasperation		
peter	remarked	scornfully	i	dare	say	when	no	one	knows	even	where	such	people	live		
sesemann	replied	the	doctor	consider	what	you	are	doing		
he	was	as	well	versed	also	in	the	ways	of	the	animals	great	and	small	and	had	many	amusing	anecdotes	to	tell	of	these	dwellers	in	caves	and	holes	and	in	the	tops	of	the	fir	trees		
he	went	like	lightning	and	when	he	reached	dorfli	which	stood	on	the	direct	road	to	mayenfeld	he	made	up	his	mind	to	go	on	further	for	he	was	sure	he	could	not	stop	his	rapid	descent	without	hurting	himself	and	the	sleigh	too		
then	came	the	picture	where	he	was	seen	far	away	from	his	father	's	house	obliged	to	look	after	the	swine	and	he	had	grown	pale	and	thin	from	the	husks	which	were	all	he	had	to	eat		
the	old	woman	gave	a	little	sigh		
the	grandfather	carried	the	cakes	and	the	shawl	and	the	large	sausage	and	the	doctor	took	heidi	's	hand	so	they	all	three	started	down	the	mountain		
you	must	put	your	arm	out	in	the	shape	of	a	ring	and	clara	must	put	hers	through	it	and	lean	her	weight	upon	you	and	whatever	you	do	do	n't	let	your	arm	give	way	like	that		
but	heidi	gave	her	grandfather	no	peace	till	he	consented	to	do	what	she	wanted	she	slept	a	great	deal	better	she	said	on	her	bed	of	hay	than	on	her	fine	pillowed	bed	in	frankfurt		
that	's	right	eat	what	you	can		
when	at	last	she	saw	that	heidi	was	growing	calmer	she	said	now	i	want	you	to	tell	me	something		
go	along	now	and	get	into	your	bath	while	i	go	and	get	some	milk	when	we	are	together	at	supper	i	will	tell	you	all	about	it		
when	grandmother	goes	away	i	shall	want	you	to	stay	on	with	me		
the	grandmother	took	the	child	's	hand	in	hers	and	held	it	closely		
and	clara	found	a	strange	new	pleasure	in	sitting	all	alone	like	this	on	the	mountain	side	her	only	companion	a	little	goat	that	looked	to	her	for	protection		
then	heidi	went	on	to	give	him	an	account	of	the	whole	day	and	of	how	delightful	it	had	all	been	and	particularly	described	the	fire	that	had	burst	out	everywhere	in	the	evening		
yes	sir	replied	sebastian	i	will	see	to	the	matter	as	you	wish		
and	then	this	one	gets	into	trouble	and	cries	save	me	god	for	there	is	none	other	to	help	me	and	god	says	why	did	you	go	from	me	i	could	not	help	you	when	you	ran	away		
twopence		
as	long	ago	as	when	his	son	tobias	was	a	child	almuncle	had	rented	the	tumble	down	old	place		
the	two	men	could	not	help	laughing	and	the	doctor	answered	that	he	should	never	have	thought	it		
at	last	after	a	great	deal	of	persuasion	from	fraulein	rottenmeier	sebastian	and	john	plucked	up	courage	and	agreed	to	sit	up	one	night	in	the	room	next	to	the	large	councilchamber	and	to	watch	and	see	what	would	happen		
she	was	not	allowed	however	a	very	long	interval	of	time	for	consideration	for	suddenly	the	sound	of	a	frightful	crash	was	heard	in	the	study	followed	by	frantic	cries	for	sebastian		
the	boy	said	nothing	but	pointed	his	finger	at	heidi		
you	keep	up	your	courage		
but	now	we	must	have	a	little	talk	together	so	dry	your	tears	and	come	and	stand	in	front	of	me	so	that	i	may	see	you	wellthere	now	we	are	happy	again		
the	door	was	doubly	locked	at	night	and	for	further	security	the	wooden	bar	was	fastened	across	it	but	it	was	no	goodnext	morning	the	door	again	stood	open		
all	of	a	sudden	before	heidi	expected	it	a	voice	called	out	mayenfeld		
do	n't	you	want	to	hear	more	about	it		
meanwhile	it	had	been	growing	dark	and	he	had	hardly	come	down	from	the	roof	and	dragged	the	sleigh	out	from	behind	the	goatshed	when	heidi	appeared	outside		
at	last	she	found	voice	to	call	loudly	tinette		
it	was	not	a	feeding	place	of	theirs	for	they	did	not	care	to	graze	on	flowers		
a	handsome	bookcase	with	glass	doors	explained	why	it	was	called	the	study	and	here	evidently	the	little	girl	was	accustomed	to	have	her	lessons		
after	a	few	minutes	silence	heidi	asked	what	could	i	take	back	to	her		
he	gave	a	little	laugh		
yes	i	did	it	is	quite	fresh		
i	assure	you	peter	replied	heidi	grandfather	knows	all	about	them		
grandmamma	being	now	seated	on	her	sturdy	animal	uncle	took	the	bridle	to	lead	her	down	the	steep	mountain	path	she	begged	him	not	to	come	far	with	her	but	he	insisted	on	seeing	her	safely	as	far	as	dorfli	for	the	way	was	precipitous	and	not	without	danger	for	the	rider	he	said		
the	doctor	found	great	pleasure	in	his	companion	's	conversation	and	was	astonished	at	his	knowledge	of	the	plants	that	grew	on	the	mountain	he	knew	the	uses	of	them	all	from	the	aromatic	fir	trees	and	the	dark	pines	with	their	scented	needles	to	the	curly	moss	that	sprang	up	everywhere	about	the	roots	of	the	trees	and	the	smallest	plant	and	tiniest	flower		
the	old	woman	had	detected	that	heidi	was	frightened	and	was	anxious	to	set	her	mind	at	ease		
here	is	some	one	exclaimed	herr	sesemann	who	will	help	to	clear	up	matters	for	me		
but	if	it	is	god	himself	who	has	sent	the	trouble	what	can	we	say	to	him	then		
then	heidi	told	him	of	the	mountain	with	the	great	snowfield	and	how	it	had	been	on	fire	and	had	turned	rosyred	and	then	all	of	a	sudden	had	grown	quite	pale	again	and	all	the	color	had	disappeared		
why	you	do	n't	know	anything	about	it	i	see	laughed	herr	sesemann		
so	he	might	take	his	time	about	returning	which	he	did	and	reached	dorfli	just	as	heidi	had	got	home	from	school	and	was	sitting	at	dinner	with	her	grandfather		
the	winter	continues	peter	arrived	punctually	at	school	the	following	day		
heidi	then	described	to	him	the	rocky	mountain	with	the	two	high	peaks	so	exactly	that	the	grandfather	was	delighted		
said	clara	hesitatingly	but	she	followed	heidi	's	advice	and	ventured	one	firm	step	on	the	ground	and	then	another	she	called	out	a	little	as	she	did	it	then	she	lifted	her	foot	again	and	went	on	oh	that	was	less	painful	already	she	exclaimed	joyfully		
why	have	you	left	off	praying		
it	was	already	dark	when	elsbeth	finally	came	to	herself	and	could	think	of	her	child		
i	think	i	will	go	to	the	pastor	who	has	already	given	me	advice	said	his	mother	delighted	to	have	found	a	way	out	of	the	difficulty		
so	they	hurried	back	to	the	house	took	a	little	bread	and	milk	and	started	on	their	way	again		
but	then	he	ran	right	away	in	order	to	get	back	without	being	wet	and	did	not	trouble	himself	further	about	the	boy		
yes	yes	i	saw	it	toni	replied	his	mother	with	a	sigh	but	did	you	hear	what	the	woodcarver	said		
then	the	man	took	the	wooden	jug	swung	the	milkpail	on	his	back	and	went	out		
for	five	years	the	family	lived	in	harmony	and	undisturbed	peace		
the	herdsman	turned	off	to	the	left	with	the	big	herd	and	the	man	went	with	toni	up	towards	the	right	followed	by	the	smaller	herd	which	consisted	of	fewer	cows	but	many	young	cattle	for	not	many	cows	could	be	kept	on	the	small	mountain	pasture	because	the	milk	had	to	be	carried	across	to	the	big	one	where	the	herdsman	's	hut	stood		
he	received	no	answer		
toni	was	so	alarmed	he	could	hardly	breathe		
toni	followed	him		
the	mother	ran	to	her	toni	and	tried	to	seize	his	hand		
it	was	not	long	before	the	work	was	finished		
oh	my	god		
the	last	rays	of	the	setting	sun	fell	across	the	meadows	and	the	sound	of	the	evening	bells	came	up	from	kandergrund		
his	mother	too	began	to	consider		
the	wrestlers	would	often	call	to	him	come	and	play		
he	can	go	up	to	the	small	mountain	with	the	cows		
now	i	will	try	one	thing	more	he	said	one	morning	to	his	wife		
he	quickly	tried	to	draw	them	too	with	his	pencil	and	at	home	continued	drawing	the	animals	again	and	again	as	long	as	he	had	a	bit	of	paper		
the	farmer	harnessed	immediately	glad	that	further	responsibility	was	taken	from	him	and	he	had	only	to	carry	toni	as	far	as	the	railway		
repeated	the	doctor	over	and	over	again		
she	had	had	only	the	one	child	and	could	so	well	understand	the	mother	's	trouble		
but	all	around	both	pastures	great	dark	masses	of	mountains	looked	down	some	rocky	gray	and	jagged	others	covered	with	snow	all	reaching	up	to	the	sky	so	high	and	mighty	and	with	such	different	peaks	and	horns	and	some	with	such	broad	backs	that	it	almost	seemed	to	toni	as	if	they	were	enormous	giants	each	one	having	his	own	face	and	looking	down	at	him		
she	forgot	everything	around	her		
thus	the	years	passed	by		
then	suddenly	the	thought	came	to	him	that	if	they	were	of	wood	they	could	stand		
now	we	are	going	for	father		
the	farmer	was	very	friendly	and	thought	her	goat	was	now	by	far	one	of	the	finest	because	she	had	had	good	fodder	so	long		
do	n't	go	to	the	farmer		
has	he	no	taste	for	some	other	occupation		
then	she	started	down	to	interlaken		
but	when	elsbeth	asked	after	her	toni	he	broke	off	abruptly	and	said	he	had	so	much	to	do	she	must	go	to	the	pastor	for	he	would	have	the	best	knowledge	about	the	boy		
do	n't	you	know	your	mother	any	more		
ca	n't	you	speak		
many	days	of	thunder	storms	followed	one	after	another	and	if	the	sun	came	out	between	it	burned	unbearably	and	new	storms	followed	so	unceasingly	and	violent	that	the	herdsman	on	the	other	mountain	often	said	that	he	had	not	known	such	a	summer	for	years	and	if	it	did	n't	change	he	would	n't	make	half	so	much	butter	as	in	former	summers	because	the	cows	gave	no	milk	as	they	did	n't	like	the	fodder		
so	the	time	passed		
but	that	really	can	not	be		
the	man	came	and	went		
it	was	very	hard	for	him	to	leave	his	mother	and	remain	away	from	her	so	much		
near	the	hut	in	the	little	shed	was	the	goat	the	milk	of	which	supplied	food	for	the	mother	and	child	while	the	father	received	his	board	through	the	week	on	the	farms	where	he	worked	from	morning	until	night		
then	lively	little	marie	jumped	down	from	her	chair	and	came	to	toni	with	a	large	piece	of	bread	and	butter		
then	the	pastor	sat	down	wrote	a	letter	and	said	to	the	herdsman	's	boy	go	back	to	the	matten	farm	and	tell	the	farmer	to	harness	his	little	carriage	and	send	it	to	me	and	then	i	will	see	that	toni	goes	today	to	bern		
toneli	repeated	the	prayer		
soon	the	doctor	appeared	and	after	he	had	prepared	the	mother	not	to	expect	toni	to	speak	at	the	first	moment	he	brought	him	in		
he	had	no	greater	wish	than	to	see	his	mother	happy	and	contented		
there	stood	a	little	hut		
toni	was	never	so	content	as	when	he	was	sitting	in	the	little	stone	hut	with	his	carving	and	his	mother	came	in	and	out	happily	employed	always	saying	a	kindly	word	to	him	and	finally	sat	down	beside	him	at	her	spinningwheel		
the	child	obeyed		
the	pastor	received	her	very	cordially	had	her	sit	down	beside	him	and	enquired	with	interest	about	her	affairs	for	he	knew	elsbeth	and	how	bravely	she	had	helped	herself	through	all	the	hard	times		
he	was	not	accustomed	to	the	ways	of	the	other	boys	since	he	had	been	constantly	alone	with	his	quietly	working	mother	and	used	to	performing	definite	tasks	continually	without	any	noise		
do	n't	forget	to	pray	when	the	day	begins	and	when	it	ends	and	the	dear	lord	will	not	forget	you	and	his	protection	is	better	than	that	of	men		
he	called	up	to	the	boy	but	received	no	answer		
i	must	go	to	him	i	must	help	him	and	see	about	bringing	him	home		
when	his	mother	finished	speaking	the	woodcarver	said	it	seemed	to	him	as	if	she	thought	the	affair	would	half	go	of	itself	but	it	was	not	so		
oh	my	lord	exclaimed	elsbeth	many	hundred	times	i	have	repeated	it	beside	his	little	bed	when	he	was	very	small	often	with	many	tears	and	he	would	weep	too	when	he	did	n't	know	why		
toni	and	the	man	stepped	inside		
the	necessary	expense	of	board	and	instruction	was	beyond	anything	that	she	could	manage	so	much	so	that	it	was	quite	out	of	the	question		
she	spoke	kindly	to	him	and	invited	him	to	come	to	the	table	and	eat	something	with	her	children		
the	mother	put	on	her	shawl	tied	on	her	best	apron	and	stepped	out	of	the	house		
a	king	could	n't	have	anything	better		
when	he	had	been	four	weeks	in	the	sanitarium	all	hope	disappeared	for	the	doctor	had	exhausted	every	means		
he	still	clung	to	her	with	the	same	love	helped	her	in	every	way	as	well	as	he	could	and	spent	his	life	beside	her	entirely	at	his	quiet	occupation	in	which	he	gradually	acquired	a	quite	gratifying	skill		
it	is	wholly	inconceivable	quite	incomprehensible		
i	have	written	to	my	friend	the	pastor	and	asked	him	if	the	boy	was	very	much	attached	to	his	mother	and	if	so	to	send	for	her	right	away		
they	had	become	perfectly	quiet		
if	you	will	only	let	me	be	a	woodcarver	i	will	work	so	hard	that	i	will	earn	enough	and	you	will	not	have	to	do	so	much	and	then	i	can	stay	at	home	with	you		
the	one	he	had	with	him	was	a	strong	sturdy	fellow	of	sixteen	years		
toni	had	long	since	fled	into	the	hut	but	the	lightning	showed	him	the	frightful	forms	and	it	seemed	every	minute	as	if	the	rolling	thunder	would	overthrow	the	hut	to	the	ground		
elsbeth	stepped	up	to	him		
then	he	came	out	again	sat	down	on	the	ground	and	carved	on	a	piece	of	wood	he	had	in	his	pocket	for	although	he	no	longer	dared	to	cherish	the	hope	of	becoming	a	woodcarver	yet	he	could	not	help	carving	for	himself	as	well	as	he	could		
then	we	will	go	too	replied	toneli	starting	yes	yes	we	shall	go	there	too	promised	his	mother	but	now	we	must	first	go	home	to	the	stone	hut	and	without	a	word	she	went	with	the	little	one	back	to	the	silent	cottage		
the	herd	had	already	been	climbing	the	mountain	for	several	hours		
toneli	remained	unmoved		
he	thought	of	his	mother	where	she	was	now	and	how	she	was	in	the	habit	of	standing	with	him	at	this	time	in	front	of	the	little	cottage	and	talking	so	pleasantly		
in	the	first	week	of	september	the	last	guests	left	the	hotel	in	interlaken	where	elsbeth	had	spent	the	summer		
see	you	must	do	so	and	the	little	girl	bit	a	good	piece	from	the	bread	and	held	it	to	him	then	again	a	little	nearer	so	he	only	needed	to	bite	into	it		
on	the	other	rock	stood	a	hunter	his	gun	hanging	by	his	side	and	his	hat	with	even	a	feather	in	it	sat	on	his	head	all	so	finely	carved	that	one	would	think	it	must	be	a	real	hat	and	a	real	little	feather	and	yet	all	was	of	wood		
now	i	understand	how	he	was	aroused	by	these	words		
here	lived	the	honest	daylaborer	toni	who	conducted	himself	well	in	every	farmhouse	where	he	went	to	work	for	he	was	quiet	and	industrious	punctual	at	his	tasks	and	reliable	in	every	way		
that	is	fortunate	continued	the	farmer		
he	drew	back	and	pressed	into	the	corner	staring	into	vacancy		
the	little	one	was	still	sitting	beside	her	on	the	ground	with	both	hands	pressed	to	his	eyes	and	sobbing	pitifully		
the	mother	found	them	at	last	she	had	suspected	that	they	had	taken	refuge	in	paula	's	room		
do	tell	me	doctor	will	her	arm	be	lame

and	wili	and	lili	jumped	about	more	than	ever	crying	out	yes	yes	rolf	wrote	it	but	we	planned	it	all	out	and	he	made	the	verses	and	jule	put	up	the	poles	and	then	we	fetched	the	fir	twigs		
well	then	try	this	one	try	hard		
then	you	are	as	old	as	paula	said	lili	regretfully	who	had	hoped	that	dora	would	belong	to	her	in	every	respect	even	in	age		
aunt	ninette	was	much	gratified	by	this	courtesy	and	accepted	it	with	pleasure	quite	forgetting	the	noise	of	the	children	which	had	been	so	great	a	bugbear	to	her		
there	is	just	such	a	dwelling	as	you	describe	now	ready	for	lodgers		
i	had	such	an	experience	myself	and	the	memory	of	that	happy	time	is	dear	to	me	even	now		
if	they	had	only	moved	away	at	once		
then	wili	repeated	after	his	mother	a	short	prayer	and	never	had	he	prayed	so	earnestly	as	now	with	his	heart	full	of	dread	for	the	results	of	his	naughty	conduct		
it	was	arranged	that	directly	after	dinner	dora	should	go	over	into	the	garden	and	stay	there	till	late	in	the	evening		
i	will	make	you	a	proposal	my	son	said	uncle	titus	as	he	rose	from	his	seat	and	prepared	to	return	to	the	cottage	come	to	me	here	every	evening	and	bring	me	the	fresh	set		
asked	the	father	when	they	were	at	last	all	busy	over	their	plates		
so	the	years	passed	and	no	thought	of	coming	sorrow	and	separation	crossed	our	young	lives	until	one	day	when	we	were	nearly	twelve	years	old	my	father	told	mei	remember	the	very	spot	in	the	garden	where	we	were	standing	at	that	momentthat	mr.	blank	lili	's	father	was	about	to	give	up	his	factory	and	return	to	germany		
but	his	mother	would	not	admit	the	resemblance		
now	see	mine	can	said	the	little	boy	who	did	not	like	to	be	called	stupid	and	he	tied	his	handkerchief	round	the	neck	of	the	long	suffering	nutcracker	and	dragged	it	after	him	up	and	down	the	room	lifting	it	up	now	and	then	at	regular	intervals		
have	you	quite	forgotten	your	father	's	verses		
oh	aunty	look		
to	lose	lili	and	to	have	her	lose	all	her	property	were	two	things	which	made	my	life	unhappy	for	a	long	long	time		
and	from	these	heavenly	messengers	the	lonely	child	gained	nightly	comfort	when	she	climbed	to	her	little	chamber	in	the	roof	with	her	feeble	candle	for	her	only	companion		
something	is	amiss	said	the	man	to	himself	and	taking	a	long	beanpole	on	his	shoulder	in	case	it	should	be	needed	he	followed	schnurri	to	the	washhouse		
me	higher	still		
the	mother	was	silent	a	very	sad	expression	rested	upon	her	face		
but	never	again	did	she	dare	even	to	speak	of	music	no	matter	how	eagerly	she	had	listened	to	the	piano	during	her	long	sewing	lessons		
she	came	back	at	once	at	the	sound	of	her	aunt	's	voice	and	took	her	appointed	place	at	the	window	where	she	was	to	sit	and	sew	all	day		
they	carried	the	bow	back	to	its	place	in	silence		
we	promised	to	be	always	true	to	each	other	and	to	use	every	effort	to	meet	again	and	then	we	sat	down	together	and	composed	a	last	poem	for	we	had	often	written	verses	together		
but	it	was	a	long	time	before	the	impression	was	effaced	from	the	child	's	imagination		
he	assured	her	that	the	wound	was	doing	perfectly	well	and	that	there	was	not	the	slightest	danger	of	any	permanent	stiffness	of	the	arm	though	he	laughingly	owned	that	he	had	made	the	worst	of	it	to	dora	in	order	to	impress	her	with	caution	for	the	future		
poor	little	dora		
no	miss	hanenwinkel	will	not	teach	me	another	till	i	have	learned	my	exercises	better	but	i	know	what	i	will	do	dora	just	wait	till	tomorrow	and	then	i	will	give	you	music	lessons	and	we	will	learn	ever	so	many	tunes		
no	rolf	she	said	quickly	thank	you	very	much	but	no	more	tonight		
i	combine	the	agreeable	with	the	useful	said	julius	gaily	returning	his	father	's	embrace		
stop		
yes	decidedly	replied	mrs.	ehrenreich	we	shall	move	on	monday		
i	am	fully	convinced	of	the	absolute	necessity	of	our	immediate	departure	said	aunt	ninette	with	emphasis		
dora	sprang	up	hastily	when	she	noticed	how	dark	it	had	grown	and	recollected	that	her	aunt	would	be	expecting	her		
then	followed	a	long	long	winter	with	its	cold	and	darkness	such	cold	that	dora	often	thought	that	even	the	hot	summer	days	were	better	for	she	no	longer	dared	to	open	the	window	to	look	for	her	friends	the	stars	and	often	she	could	hardly	get	to	sleep	it	was	so	cold	in	the	little	room	under	the	roof		
the	consequences	may	be	very	serious	and	the	matter	must	not	be	lightly	treated		
the	sound	of	the	family	coming	back	from	church	added	to	their	embarrassment		
it	looks	like	an	enchanted	spot	and	now	for	my	favorite	appletree		
but	gonocome	here	to	the	water		
the	doctor	came	as	quickly	as	possible		
you	can	never	sew	any	more	nor	do	anything	else		
the	idea	of	this	coming	freedom	almost	overcame	her	with	its	bewildering	delight	after	all	those	long	long	days	in	the	seamstress	little	stifling	room		
for	i	had	no	such	outfit	for	my	dolls	as	you	children	have	now	no	sofas	and	chairs	and	other	furniture		
why	it	can	coverwellthe	shell	covers	it		
he	defended	himself	to	the	best	of	his	ability		
he	went	on	down	stairs	still	laughing	and	just	at	the	front	door	met	his	mother		
they	gathered	up	their	work	and	books	and	returned	slowly	to	the	house	under	the	triumphal	arch	that	still	spanned	the	gardendoor	of	the	house		
but	what	will	be	the	end	if	this	is	the	beginning		
cried	his	mother	now	thoroughly	alarmed	for	she	instantly	recalled	having	seen	the	doctor	hurry	by	to	the	cottage	when	they	were	at	dinner		
a	frightful	deed		
however	perhaps	there	would	be	less	noise	over	the	hedge	after	this	and	the	windows	could	be	opened		
and	before	dora	could	protest	the	indefatigable	riddlemaker	declaimed	    	my	fickle	first	is	said	to	be	     	england	's	highroad	of	industry	     	but	germany	denies	the	same	     	and	with	a	key	she	makes	her	claim		
and	he	read	it	aloud		
meantime	schnurri	all	drippingwet	ran	to	the	shed	where	battiste	was	shaping	beanpoles	for	the	kitchen	garden		
there	there	i	hope	i	did	not	hurt	you	he	said	tapping	the	frightened	child	upon	the	shoulder		
lately	i	have	not	thought	of	it	at	all	but	telling	you	the	story	of	my	early	friendship	brought	it	again	to	my	mind		
do	n't	go	too	high	up	but	stay	there	six	weeks	at	least		
i	believe	we	have	a	riddlefever	and	one	catches	it	from	another		
her	father	had	told	her	that	god	would	always	help	those	who	trusted	him	and	prayed	to	him	and	she	had	no	fear		
cried	aunt	ninette	in	her	most	plaintive	tone	running	down	the	stairs	to	overtake	him		
going	down	stairs	he	met	miss	hanenwinkel		
if	your	choice	falls	on	the	twins	you	will	be	torn	in	two	and	as	to	little	hunne	if	you	go	with	him	he	will	talk	you	deaf		
those	visits	seemed	to	me	like	prolonged	festivals		
hunne	carefully	divided	each	kernel	giving	one	half	to	jule	while	he	popped	the	other	into	his	own	little	mouth		
her	timidity	came	back	again	at	seeing	the	parents	for	she	had	expected	to	see	only	the	children		
said	uncle	titus	tapping	the	lad	kindly	on	the	shoulder		
then	she	explained	to	lili	that	when	they	had	enough	water	they	could	push	the	spout	away	from	the	log	and	when	they	wanted	it	again	they	could	lift	it	up	and	put	it	into	the	log	themselves		
before	she	knew	it	the	time	had	come	and	her	aunt	said	now	dora	you	can	go		
he	rushed	back	to	the	house	calling	out	jule	paula	did	you	know	that	the	twins	shot	a	child	yesterday		
when	the	widow	had	talked	herself	out	mrs.	birkenfeld	asked	if	she	could	speak	to	the	lady	and	to	the	little	girl	who	had	been	hurt		
mrs.	ehrenreich	wrote	immediately	setting	forth	her	wishes	at	full	length	and	in	great	detail		
here	lili	found	him	and	she	planted	herself	before	him	with	her	hands	behind	her	back	just	as	she	had	seen	her	papa	stand	when	giving	orders		
her	aunt	cast	a	rapid	glance	from	the	window	and	saw	that	this	was	true	everything	was	dark	even	the	last	lantern	extinguished		
at	this	moment	the	big	bell	rang	for	supper		
early	the	next	day	as	julius	was	clattering	along	the	passage	with	his	big	ridingboots	and	spurs	he	heard	the	sounds	of	practising	in	the	schoolroom	and	knowing	that	miss	hanenwinkel	did	not	give	lessons	at	this	hour	he	pushed	open	the	door	to	see	what	was	going	on		
stop	playing	with	the	nuts	and	i	will	crack	some	more	for	you	bye	and	bye		
suddenly	a	new	fear	seized	them		
but	she	did	not	wake	up	except	to	find	that	her	plate	had	been	loaded	with	good	things	so	very	real	that	all	anxiety	passed	away	and	she	realized	that	she	was	living	and	living	remarkably	well	into	the	bargain		
they	looked	at	each	other	in	great	fright
