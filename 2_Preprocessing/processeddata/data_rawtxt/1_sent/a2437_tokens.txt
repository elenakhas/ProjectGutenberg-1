these	did	frankly	loot	a	provincenorth	africaand	they	and	they	alone	of	the	auxiliary	troops	did	revolt	against	the	imperial	system	and	defy	it	for	a	century	but	the	vandals	themselves	were	already	before	their	adventure	a	part	of	the	imperial	forces	they	were	but	a	nucleus	for	a	mixed	host	made	up	of	all	the	varied	elements	of	rebellion	present	in	the	country	and	their	experiment	in	separation	went	down	at	last	forever	before	the	imperial	armies		
there	was	one	unending	series	of	attacks	pagan	and	mohammedan	from	the	north	from	the	east	and	from	the	south	attacks	not	comparable	to	the	older	raids	of	external	hordes	eager	only	to	enjoy	civilization	within	the	empire	small	in	number	and	yet	ready	to	accept	the	faith	and	customs	of	europe		
in	other	words	we	are	certain	that	the	little	pagan	courts	settled	on	the	east	coast	of	britain	were	balanced	by	a	remaining	mass	of	declining	roman	civilization	elsewhere	and	that	there	was	no	attempt	at	anything	like	expansion	or	conquest	from	the	east	westward		
in	spain	in	gaul	in	italy	as	in	africa	economic	power	had	concentrated	into	the	hands	of	exceedingly	few	men		
such	a	point	of	view	is	wrong	historically	as	it	is	wrong	in	morals		
the	transformation	of	the	roman	empire	then	in	the	fourth	century	and	the	fifth	was	eventually	its	preservation	in	peril	of	full	decay	by	its	acceptation	of	the	faith		
if	it	be	in	the	spiritual	order	as	are	all	major	things	the	reader	must	attempt	his	own	reply	based	upon	other	aptitudes	than	those	of	historic	science		
footnote	for	instance	there	is	no	contemporary	account	mentioning	london	during	the	last	half	of	the	fifth	and	nearly	all	the	sixth	century		
footnote	the	single	sentence	in	prosper	is	insignificantand	what	is	more	demonstrably	false	as	it	stands		
for	instance	our	first	knowledge	of	teutonic	dialect	is	of	the	eighth	century	the	socalled	early	gothic	is	a	fraud	but	even	then	quite	half	the	words	or	more	are	truly	german	apparently	unaffected	by	the	imperial	laws	and	speech		
it	is	not	credible	that	a	man	of	this	weight	would	write	as	he	does	without	solid	tradition	behind	him	and	he	tells	us	that	the	settlers	on	this	coast	of	britain	came	from	three	lowland	frisian	tribes	german	and	danish	called	saxons	jutes	and	angles		
the	islands	of	the	mediterranean	fell		
the	thing	is	not	physically	impossible	but	it	is	so	exceedingly	improbable	that	common	sense	laughs	at	it		
the	conception	of	representative	assembly	monastic	in	origin	fruitfully	transferred	to	civilian	soil	appears	in	the	institutions	of	christendom		
now	the	point	to	seize	is	this	inimical	as	such	a	revolt	was	to	souls	or	to	speak	upon	the	mere	historical	plane	to	civilization	bad	as	it	was	that	the	tide	of	culture	should	have	begun	to	ebb	from	the	far	regions	which	it	had	once	so	beneficently	flooded	the	reformation	that	is	the	reaction	against	the	unity	the	discipline	and	the	clear	thought	of	europe	would	never	have	counted	largely	in	human	affairs	had	it	been	confined	to	the	external	fringe	of	the	civilized	world		
the	rex	of	say	batavian	auxiliaries	the	commander	of	the	batavian	corps	would	probably	be	a	man	of	batavian	blood	with	hereditary	position	and	would	be	called	rex	bataviorum		
the	city	which	had	arrived	at	such	a	position	and	which	was	now	the	manifest	capital	of	the	italian	scheme	was	rome		
if	he	were	as	a	small	minority	even	of	the	rich	already	were	in	sympathy	with	it	though	not	of	it	it	would	still	have	concerned	him		
it	means	1	the	chieftain	of	an	auxiliary	group	of	soldiers	who	holds	an	imperial	commission	and	it	means	2	that	man	acting	as	a	local	governor		
in	geneva	calvin	was	a	god		
there	is	on	the	contrary	a	very	definite	and	clearly	marked	historical	sequence	between	roman	civilization	and	the	feudal	system	attested	by	innumerable	documents	which	once	read	and	compared	in	their	order	leave	no	sort	of	doubt	that	feudalism	and	the	medi√¶val	civilization	repose	on	purely	roman	origins		
on	the	analogy	of	all	similar	experiments	we	can	be	fairly	certain	of	what	happened	though	there	is	no	contemporary	record	of	such	domestic	details	in	the	case	of	normandy		
was	small	compared	with	the	numbers	of	civilization	and	i	repeat	in	the	eyes	of	the	citizens	of	the	empire	their	lack	of	culture	made	them	more	insignificant	still		
but	that	thesis	still	tries	to	make	out	a	plausible	case	when	it	speaks	of	britain	because	so	much	of	the	record	here	is	lost	that	there	is	more	room	for	makebelieve	and	having	made	it	out	the	tale	of	a	german	and	barbaric	england	his	false	result	will	powerfully	affect	modern	and	immediate	conclusions	upon	our	common	civilization	upon	our	institutions	and	their	nature	and	in	particular	upon	the	faith	and	its	authority	in	europe		
it	is	this	the	dark	ages	were	the	point	during	which	there	very	gradually	germinated	and	came	into	outward	existence	things	which	still	remain	among	us	and	help	to	differentiate	our	christendom	from	the	past	of	classical	antiquity		
our	christian	and	roman	culture	proceeds	continuously	eastward	mastering	the	uncouth		
it	was	not	savage	like	the	germanies	it	was	therefore	under	no	necessity	to	go	to	school		
in	the	second	phase	which	corresponded	with	the	beginning	of	a	decline	in	letters	and	in	the	arts	which	carries	us	through	the	welter	of	civil	wars	in	the	third	century	and	which	introduces	the	remodeled	empire	at	their	close	the	army	was	becoming	purely	professional	and	at	the	same	time	drawn	from	whatever	was	least	fortunate	in	roman	society		
always	they	prove	themselves	before	posterity	to	have	done	much	more	than	any	other	mold	of	man		
in	the	case	of	local	italian	government	the	case	is	quite	clear		
as	with	destruction	so	with	decay	there	is	no	increasing	proportion	as	we	go	from	the	west	eastward	towards	the	pirate	settlements		
the	name	most	prominently	associated	with	the	crisis	is	that	of	martin	luther	an	augustinian	monk	german	by	birth	and	speech	and	one	of	those	exuberant	sensual	rather	inconsequential	characters	which	so	easily	attract	hearty	friendships	and	which	can	never	pretend	to	organization	or	command	though	certainly	to	creative	power		
of	this	sort	was	ancient	egypt		
they	never	dreamt	of	conquest		
the	bread	and	wine	so	consecrated	were	certainly	called	universally	the	body	of	the	lord		
gaul	was	to	preserve	all	that	could	be	preserved	of	the	material	side	of	europe	and	also	of	the	european	spirit		
in	so	far	as	it	existed	it	would	have	been	on	all	fours	with	any	one	of	the	vague	opinions	which	floated	about	the	cultured	roman	world		
that	command	was	long	absolute	and	carthaginian	power	depended	on	it	wholly

we	have	seen	that	the	administration	of	these	local	governments	usually	devolved	on	the	chief	officers	of	the	auxiliary	barbarian	troops	who	were	also	as	a	rule	their	chieftains	by	some	kind	of	inheritance

the	actual	wording	of	news	is	often	chosen	in	order	to	deceive	although	the	figures	may	be	accurate

and	luckily	for	us	that	wastage	has	been	particularly	heavy	in	the	matter	of	officers		
to	keep	such	a	web	untangled	duly	stretched	and	accurately	working	is	an	effort	of	organization	such	as	will	never	be	seen	in	civilian	life	and	such	as	was	never	seen	even	in	military	life	until	modern	times		
false	news	too	readily	credited	does	not	leave	people	merely	insufficiently	informed	conscious	of	their	ignorance	and	merely	grumbling	because	they	can	not	learn	more	it	has	the	positive	effect	of	putting	them	into	the	wrong	frame	of	mind	of	making	them	support	what	they	should	not	support	and	neglect	what	they	should	not	neglect		
and	in	time	of	war	the	whole	nation	begins	at	once	to	use	instruments	right	and	left	for	military	purposes	which	instruments	had	been	originally	designed	for	civilian	purposes		
the	list	of	questions	detailed	and	general	which	have	already	been	wholly	or	partly	answered	by	the	present	campaigns	might	be	indefinitely	extended		
why	must	the	censor	act	thus		
but	when	large	and	at	the	same	time	mobile	howitzers	were	constructed	which	though	they	fired	shells	of	a	quarter	of	a	ton	and	more	could	go	along	almost	over	any	ground	and	be	fired	from	almost	anywhere	and	moved	at	comparatively	short	notice	from	one	place	to	another	it	was	another	matter		
without	it	or	against	it	in	time	of	war	you	can	not	govern		
but	at	the	opening	of	the	war	say	by	the	middle	of	september	when	she	had	perhaps	at	the	most	twoandahalf	million	men	in	poland	the	total	forces	of	the	enemy	that	is	the	total	number	of	men	austria	and	germany	had	equipped	trained	and	ready	for	the	field	since	the	beginning	of	the	war	was	at	least	eight	million

with	the	northern	slavs	we	count	the	bohemians	or	czechs	the	poles	and	the	russiansusing	the	latter	term	of	course	for	many	distinct	but	connected	groups	for	it	is	certain	that	russia	proper	must	remain	a	unity		
there	is	one	other	point	which	i	have	already	alluded	to	briefly	in	which	german	communiqu√©s	may	mislead	and	that	is	in	the	way	they	handle	statistics		
the	allied	forces	had	advantagesthe	english	in	personal	equipment	medical	and	commissariat	service	the	french	russians	and	serbians	in	the	type	of	field	gun		
of	their	total	population	the	russians	1	per	cent	the	germans	perhaps	5	per	cent	the	austrians	between	3	and	4	per	cent	the	serbians	quite	10	per	cent.and	10	per	cent		
this	seemed	obvious	but	the	critics	of	the	second	system	of	close	or	swarm	formation	always	said	that	though	they	admitted	its	enormous	power	if	it	could	be	used	at	all	it	could	not	be	used	because	its	losses	would	be	so	enormous	against	modern	firearms		
it	is	advisable	not	only	to	discover	such	novelties	but	also	the	permanent	features	which	even	modern	machinery	and	modern	numbers	have	not	changed		
the	six	remaining	sections	would	have	to	group	themselves	as	above	and	in	either	case	there	would	be	a	bad	gap		
a	modern	quickfiring	piece	firing	moderately	will	get	rid	of	a	ten	pound	note	in	ammunition	in	a	minute		
the	ring	fortress	18601914)a	series	of	detached	forts	lying	three	or	four	miles	outside	the	inner	place	of	stores	barracks	etc	which	it	was	desired	to	defend		
it	will	be	seen	that	from	this	rough	calculation	the	wastage	of	the	enemy	has	been	so	much	greater	than	our	own	that	if	it	were	absolute	his	preponderance	in	numbers	would	have	ceased	and	the	figures	would	stand	nearly	equal		
we	may	take	it	that	the	object	is	nearly	always	domestic	and	political		
ultimately	all	europeans	have	much	the	same	potential	moral

it	needs	adaptation	it	is	used	far	more	roughly	has	a	shorter	life	and	is	being	therefore	more	expensively	consumed		
today	the	11inch	howitzer	with	a	range	of	about	six	miles	capable	of	hiding	behind	any	elevation	and	not	to	be	discovered	by	any	gun	within	the	fortress	and	further	capable	of	being	moved	at	a	moment	‚Äôs	notice	if	it	is	discovered	has	the	fortress	at	its	mercy		
i	mean	by	the	effect	of	absolute	numbers	the	fact	that	a	certain	minimum	is	required	for	any	particular	operation		
the	first	of	these	is	so	much	the	more	obvious	in	the	public	eye	that	it	is	often	alone	considered		
lastly	there	is	the	indeterminate	but	heavy	medical	expense		
the	whole	process	may	be	compared	to	the	perpetual	running	of	millions	of	double	threads	which	reach	from	every	soldier	back	ultimately	to	the	central	depots	of	the	army	and	thence	to	the	manufactories	and	these	double	threads	perpetually	working	back	and	forth	from	the	manufactories	to	the	front		
and	these	chief	points	with	regard	to	supply	may	be	put	briefly	in	three	groups		
she	would	keep	alsacelorraine	she	would	keep	in	subjection	the	poles	who	are	already	in	subjection	to	her	she	would	leave	the	austrohungarian	monarchy	under	the	hapsburgs	with	all	its	present	possessions	whether	those	possessions	grossly	interfered	with	national	realities	or	no		
for	instance	in	this	example	of	the	supposed	investment	of	cracow		
these	earthworks	were	starshaped	sending	out	a	number	of	projecting	angles	so	that	an	attack	launched	upon	any	point	would	receive	converging	fire	from	two	points	of	the	star	and	the	entrances	were	further	protected	by	outer	works	called	horn	works		
racially	the	roumanians	are	probably	slavs	for	the	most	part	but	their	tongue	is	a	latin	tongue	they	are	proud	of	latin	descent	and	they	are	just	as	much	a	wedge	between	the	slavs	of	the	north	and	south	as	the	magyars	themselves		
but	if	we	consider	only	the	principal	ones	we	shall	find	that	they	fall	roughly	into	two	main	categories		
if	you	want	to	make	your	shell	fall	into	a	trench	of	a	fortification	or	come	down	exactly	on	the	top	of	the	shelter	in	a	fort	as	at	a	the	trench	in	the	fifth	diagram	or	at	b	the	shelter	it	is	obvious	that	your	howitzer	firing	from	h	and	lobbing	a	projectile	along	the	highangle	trajectory	m	will	have	a	much	better	chance	of	hitting	it	than	your	gun	g	sending	a	projectile	further	indeed	but	along	the	flatter	trajectory	n.	of	course	another	howitzer	within	the	fortifications	could	in	theory	lob	a	shell	of	its	own	over	the	hill	and	hit	the	besieging	howitzer	but	in	practice	it	is	very	easy	for	the	besieging	howitzer	to	find	out	exactly	where	the	vulnerable	points	of	the	fortress	areits	trenches	and	its	shelter	and	magazineand	very	difficult	for	the	people	in	the	fortress	to	find	out	where	the	howitzer	outside	is		
if	the	extreme	point	at	which	you	can	stop	a	rush	is	the	line	ll	then	you	must	have	at	least	enough	menaaato	cover	that	line	with	their	fire		
when	you	are	dealing	with	many	miles	of	men	whose	armament	is	not	only	destructive	at	a	great	distance	but	also	over	a	wide	belt	of	ground	you	have	in	the	first	place	a	vast	extension	of	any	possible	defensive	lines		
2	now	what	of	proportionate	numbers		
it	is	always	absolutely	wise	to	prevent	the	enemy	in	time	of	war	from	learning	things	which	would	be	an	aid	to	him		
the	castles	went	down	like	ninepins		
they	are	wise	to	do	  	this	because	there	is	no	need	to	tell	the	enemy	more	than	  	he	may	know	of	his	own	success		
every	time	one	of	them	fires	a	shot	it	fires	away	fifteen	shillings

the	wall	of	china	is	one	great	instance	of	them	the	roman	wall	over	the	north	of	britain	from	sea	to	sea	is	another	and	the	longfortified	roman	frontier	from	the	rhine	to	the	danube	was	a	third		
that	for	instance	was	the	object	of	a	castle	in	the	middle	ages		
but	it	was	certain	that	she	could	not	equip	more	than	a	certain	number	in	a	given	time	or	train	them	or	officer	them	or	govern	them		
here	is	one	fairly	graphic	way	of	showing	what	this	scale	of	supply	means		
illustration	diagram	v.	if	you	want	to	make	your	shell	fall	into	a	trench	of	a	fortification	a	or	come	down	exactly	on	the	top	of	the	shelter	in	a	fort	b	it	is	obvious	that	your	howitzer	firing	from	h	and	lobbing	a	projectile	along	the	highangle	trajectory	m	will	have	a	much	better	chance	of	hitting	it	than	your	gun	g	sending	a	projectile	further	indeed	but	along	the	flatter	trajectory	n.	the	advantage	of	the	howitzer	is	twofold		
it	is	evident	that	a	mile	of	trench	for	instance	could	not	be	held	by	halfadozen	men	even	if	the	forces	opposed	to	them	were	only	a	halfdozen		
thus	it	would	be	no	shortening	of	the	german	line	to	fall	back	upon	the	rhine		
secondly	the	howitzer	can	drop	its	shell	into	a	comparatively	narrow	trench	which	the	projectile	of	a	gun	with	its	flat	trajectory	will	probably	miss		
you	must	be	able	as	you	retreat	to	check	your	enemy	appreciably	before	you	can	trace	such	a	line	you	must	be	able	to	hammer	him	badly	with	heavy	guns	stronger	than	his	own	while	you	are	making	it	and	unless	you	are	present	in	very	great	numbers	you	will	only	be	able	to	draw	it	over	a	comparatively	short	line	which	your	enemy	may	be	able	to	turn	by	the	left	or	the	right		
the	position	of	holland	after	a	german	settlement	might	not	uncertainly	be	compared	to	the	position	of	hamburg	in	the	old	days	on	a	larger	scale	a	free	state	just	as	hamburg	was	a	free	city		
the	french	had	in	the	field	at	the	outset	of	the	war	5	per	cent		
its	main	principles	are	simple	enough		
she	would	leave	it	as	independent	in	its	own	eyes	as	it	was	before	she	might	insist	upon	an	alliance	with	the	dutch	army	she	would	certainly	insist	upon	commercial	terms	and	probably	rights	of	using	certain	ports	in	certain	cases	for	war		
and	what	is	more	grave	opinion	is	sometimes	led	to	misjudge	altogether	the	nature	of	war	by	these	novelties		
it	is	however	minutely	accurate	and	even	detailed	in	helping	us	to	locate	the	fluctuations	of	the	front	and	by	the	aid	of	the	french	communiqu√©s	we	can	follow	the	war	upon	the	map	better	than	by	the	aid	of	any	other
