there	he	would	find	goldpure	goldwonderful	fortune	to	bring	back	to	his	poor	people	to	build	a	church	for	them	and	a	city		
when	he	touched	them	golden	ashes	drifted	from	them	and	blew	down	among	the	rocks		
it	would	be	dreadful	if	they	were	to	kill	anybody	or	especially	if	one	of	them	should	be	killed	miss	hammond	you	've	changed	things	considerable	out	here	but	you	ca	n't	change	these	men		
i	took	him	in	to	see	bonita		
bonita	will	tell	you	some	staggerin	news	about	that	outfit		
come	hyar	you	sonofagun	said	stillwell		
she	marked	the	gray	valley	and	the	black	mountains	and	the	wide	red	gateway	of	the	desert	and	the	dim	shadowy	peaks	blue	as	the	sky	they	pierced		
he	leaped	at	his	black	horse	and	dragged	him	to	where	his	saddle	lay		
in	helping	him	had	she	hedged	round	her	forces	that	had	just	operated	to	save	her	life	or	if	not	that	more	than	life	was	to	her		
the	wind	would	blow	us	off	this	slope	if	the	rain	did	n't	wash	us	off		
madeline	was	uneasy	because	several	of	her	party	including	helen	and	dorothy	had	ridden	off	with	the	cowboys	that	afternoon	and	had	not	returned		
in	the	background	behind	stillwell	and	alfred	stood	nick	steele	head	and	shoulders	over	a	number	of	vaqueros	and	cowboys		
what	time	did	you	arrive	at	el	cajon	thet	night	it	was	after	eleven	o'clock	replied	madeline		
what	's	wrong	asked	nels	lifting	his	hand	again		
my	word	is	not	lightly	given		
upon	the	ascent	of	the	third	ridge	which	madeline	remembered	was	the	last	uneven	ground	between	the	point	she	had	reached	and	home	florence	exercised	even	more	guarded	care	in	advancing		
his	grave	face	paler	than	she	had	ever	beheld	it	caused	her	to	stretch	an	appealing	hand	toward	him		
the	feel	of	the	thing	revived	her		
he	was	assuring	and	bland	but	his	hurry	to	convince	madeline	betrayed	him		
she	felt	the	pound	of	his	heart	her	own	seemed	to	have	frozen		
when	he	had	learned	all	florence	and	madeline	would	tell	him	he	expressed	a	desire	to	have	the	cowboys	attend	and	then	he	went	on	to	talk	about	california	where	he	was	going	take	florence	on	a	short	trip		
now	nels	cut	the	gurl	loose	ordered	monty		
these	flying	bands	operating	under	the	excitement	of	the	revolution	appeared	here	and	there	everywhere	in	remote	places	and	were	gone	as	quickly	as	they	came		
it	was	only	a	matter	of	a	few	moments	for	her	to	close	and	bar	the	heavy	shutters	yet	even	as	she	was	fastening	the	last	one	in	the	room	she	used	as	an	office	a	clattering	roar	of	hoofs	seemed	to	swell	up	to	the	front	of	the	house		
cool	down	son	it	'll	all	come	right	suddenly	madeline	was	transfixed	by	a	terrible	sound		
madeline	had	to	believe	that	a	hard	and	perilous	life	in	a	barren	and	wild	country	developed	great	principles	in	men		
madeline	caught	herself	in	time		
he	lost	his	spirit		
he	's	notorious	fer	shirkin	his	share	of	the	grub	deal		
she	sent	nels	mounted	upon	his	own	horse	and	leading	majesty	to	rodeo	in	search	of	stewart		
get	back	from	in	front	oh	that	was	one	of	them	durned	crazy	words	monty	is	always	hollerin		
whatever	that	something	was	it	dispelled	stewart	's	impatience		
perhaps	it	was	the	last	thing	needed	to	transform	these	men	doing	unaccustomed	duty	as	escorts	of	beautiful	women	to	their	natural	state	as	men	of	the	wild		
it	was	perhaps	fortunate	for	her	she	thought	that	the	climb	up	the	slope	cut	the	black	's	speed	so	she	could	manage	him		
he	's	a	man	miss	majesty	a	wonderful	man		
stewart	however	immediately	slipped	out	of	her	mind	as	she	surveyed	the	group	of	cowboys	on	the	links		
it	was	the	dark	hour	before	dawn		
i	charge	you	as	an	officer	to	confiscate	these	goods	and	to	arrest	the	smugglerdon	carlos	these	words	of	stewart	's	precipitated	a	riot	among	don	carlos	and	his	followers	and	they	surged	wildly	around	the	sheriff		
madeline	did	not	recognize	stewart		
she	was	haunted	by	monty	price	's	terrible	smile		
if	i	did	i'di'd	her	eyes	expressed	the	direful	punishment	she	could	not	speak		
the	halls	were	dark	the	rooms	huge	empty	and	musty	and	there	was	an	air	of	silence	and	secrecy	and	mystery	about	them	most	fitting	to	the	character	florence	had	bestowed	upon	the	place		
she	saw	no	one		
wild		
the	men	moreover	were	just	as	hungry	and	as	wild	and	beggarly		
through	the	troops	along	the	border		
they	got	so	they	could	n't	kill	a	coyote	a	crippled	calf	in	a	mudhole		
but	when	she	came		
madeline	heard	boyd	harvey	ask	stewart	if	lawlessness	such	as	he	had	mentioned	was	not	unusual		
the	horse	neared	the	corrals	disappeared	into	a	lane	and	then	breaking	his	gait	again	thundered	into	the	inclosure	and	pounded	to	a	halt	some	twenty	yards	from	where	stillwell	waited	for	him		
this	surprised	her	but	not	nearly	so	much	as	the	fact	that	after	a	few	weeks	she	found	she	scarcely	remembered	the	adventures	at	all		
he	's	been	hurt	i	reckon		
madeline	could	tell	that	though	she	did	not	know	what	was	said		
take	a	look	at	the	last	doggone	weight	you	ever	packed		
just	how	it	all	happened	seemed	to	be	beyond	christine		
madeline	thought	she	had	never	seen	such	a	cleareyed	healthy	splendid	girl		
the	ground	appeared	to	be	flat	but	the	road	went	up	and	down	over	little	ridges		
a	red	glow	faded	in	the	west		
now	here	i	'm	supposed	to	be	consulting	an	officer	of	the	law		
she	's	told	me	how	she	was	dragged	down	here	how	gene	tried	to	save	her	how	you	spoke	up	for	gene	an	her	too	how	monty	at	the	last	throwed	his	guns		
now	if	you	really	will	see	him	miss	hammond	it	's	a	good	chance		
but	the	fire	ketched	monty	at	the	last		
wal	that	's	a	plumb	good	idee		
he	had	left	his	guns	there		
the	only	trouble	would	becould	anybody	stop	looking	at	the	scenery	long	enough	to	hit	a	ball		
you	holler	law	an	my	way	is	the	ole	law	his	breath	came	quicker	his	voice	grew	hoarser	and	he	crouched	lower		
florence	for	long	you	have	promised	to	tell	us	the	story	of	the	lost	mine	of	the	padres		
stewart	's	dark	eyes	searched	the	slopes	high	up	along	the	craggy	escarpments		
ah	there	's	a	horse	climbing	the	hill		
i	'll	sure	tell	you	what	gene	stewart	will	do	said	florence		
i	come	down	that	day	gene	sent	his	horse	majesty	to	you		
gene	he	says	what	the	hell	struck	you		
miss	majesty	it	'll	be	some	oninterestin	ride	all	mawnin		
bent	and	stiffthat	means	every	muscle	is	like	a	rawhide	riata		
is	that	necessary		
but	before	he	died	he	went	to	the	old	indians	who	had	burned	the	maiden	and	he	begged	them	when	he	was	dead	to	burn	his	body	and	to	cast	his	ashes	to	the	wind	from	that	wonderful	slope	where	they	would	blow	away	to	mingle	forever	with	those	of	his	indian	sweetheart		
sneed	dropped	the	manacles		
he	had	been	so	bitterly	hurt	that	no	one	not	even	madeline	could	get	out	of	him	what	had	happened		
one	evening	at	twilight	as	madeline	was	leaving	her	tent	she	encountered	monty		
i	hate	to	preach	this	way		
the	subtle	consciousness	of	change	in	her	was	the	birth	of	that	faith	she	had	revered	in	stillwell		
them	critters		
he	groaned	and	staggering	up	to	the	broken	wall	he	leaned	there	with	his	face	hidden		
there	's	almost	no	ketchin	them	an	they	regrowin	all	the	time	we	ai	n't	had	no	luck	this	spring		
these	trees	grew	up	down	and	out	and	twisted	in	curves	and	many	were	two	feet	in	thickness		
you	'd	never	think	so	till	you	go	down		
he	was	in	shirt	sleeves	sweating	freely	and	wore	a	frown	i	had	never	seen	before		
then	the	dim	purple	of	its	color	told	of	its	great	distance	from	me	and	then	its	familiar	shape	told	i	had	come	into	my	own	againi	had	found	my	old	friend	once	more		
the	order	of	the	day	was	leisurely	to	get	in	readiness	and	pack	for	our	journey	to	the	siwash	on	the	morrow		
how	's	this		
more	than	a	hundred	little	reddishblack	calves	leisurely	loped	in	the	rear		
the	canyon	apparently	closed	in	on	us	so	camp	was	made	for	the	night		
no	man	knows	it	an	the	cougars	do		
i	want	to	get	in	the	snow	returned	jones		
this	is	no	mean	discovery	let	me	tell	you	that	he	declared		
we	all	proposed	names	montezuma	's	amphitheater	being	the	only	rival	of	jones	's	selection	echo	cave	which	we	finally	chose		
i	cried	trying	to	hide	my	unholy	glee		
sometimes	we	were	all	sliding	at	once	like	boys	on	a	pond	with	the	difference	that	we	were	in	danger		
the	bunch	in	corral	we	got	last	year		
if	i	rope	him	i	can	use	that	tree		
supper	that	night	even	if	we	did	grind	sand	with	our	teeth	was	a	joyous	occasion		
shoonover	said	schmitt	commenced	to	sweat		
jones	appeared	particularly	happy	and	his	first	move	after	dismounting	was	to	stretch	out	the	lion	skin	and	measure	it		
i	found	it	came	from	a	thick	layer	of	straw	under	my	bed	and	had	been	tied	to	the	end	of	a	flatly	coiled	lasso		
tige	and	the	pup	went	down	with	me	an	treed	a	cougar		
his	hoarse	deep	voice	rang	defiance	to	the	foe		
he	stood	immovable	while	they	perpetrated	the	outrage	then	calmly	wiped	his	cheeks	and	in	his	strange	cool	voice	addressed	the	interpreter		
comanches		
of	course	i	got	hold	of	this	spread	a	generous	portion	on	my	hot	biscuit	placed	some	redhot	beans	on	that	and	began	to	eat	like	a	hungry	hunter		
demanded	jones		
yes	they	did	an	i	set	under	a	pinyon	holdin	the	pup	while	tige	kept	the	cougar	treed		
all	day	they	rustle	softly	all	night	they	swirled	sweeping	seeping	brushing	against	the	cabin		
the	genial	foreman	loved	a	joke		
the	indians	call	the	buffalo	leader	the	weetah	the	master	of	the	herd		
a	blinding	white	flutter	of	grey	flakes	as	large	as	feathers		
there	may	have	been	two	lions		
an	when	they	light	on	me	i	never	move	nor	even	breathe	fer	about	five	minutes		
warm	patches	of	sunlight	like	gold	brightened	the	ground	dark	patches	of	sky	like	ocean	blue	gleamed	between	the	treetops		
and	jimslow	careful	jim	dropped	a	plate	with	the	exclamation	shore	it	do	beat	hell		
sounder	appeared	and	came	to	him	evidently	having	given	up	the	chase		
a	rude	cabin	of	roughhewn	logs	stood	near	the	spring		
i	wore	my	left	glove	to	tatters	and	threw	it	away	to	put	the	right	one	on	my	left	hand		
i	observed	then	that	the	lizard	had	his	jewel	eyes	upon	the	bee	he	slipped	to	the	edge	of	the	stone	flicked	out	a	long	red	tongue	and	tore	the	insect	from	its	honeyed	perch		
we	'll	each	take	a	dog	and	search	in	different	directions		
just	as	the	hounds	jumped	the	cougaroh		
taking	his	cue	i	did	likewise		
the	mother	had	fallen	beside	him		
outworn	nature	rebelled	and	both	hunters	slept		
it	proved	to	be	the	forest	of	little	sticks	where	with	grateful	assurance	of	fire	and	of	soon	finding	their	old	trail	they	made	camp		
i	dodged	the	jutting	rocks	and	projecting	snags	felt	stinging	branches	in	my	face	and	the	rush	of	sweet	dry	wind		
loosing	the	lion	he	held	his	hounds	back	a	moment	then	let	them	go		
i	shifted	from	side	to	side	from	leg	to	leg	in	my	saddle	dismounted	and	hobbled	before	satan	mounted	again	and	rode	on		
i	devoured	four	chops	and	could	not	have	been	counted	in	the	running		
all	of	the	party	worked	on	the	cougar	skin	that	afternoon		
only	be	sure	to	hev	them	get	ahead	of	the	white	mustang	so	he	'll	hev	only	one	way	to	cum	fer	he	sure	is	knowin		
do	you	hear	thet	rumble		
when	i	got	my	saddle	off	satan	had	given	him	a	drink	and	hobbled	him	i	crept	into	the	cabin	and	dropped	like	a	log		
all	the	way	up	we	had	played	the	boy	's	game	of	spying	for	sights	with	the	honors	about	even		
how	impossible	to	understand		
satan	knew	it	as	well	as	i	for	he	quickened	his	pace	and	sent	the	stones	clattering	behind	him		
the	sun	has	been	oozin	round	here	some		
give	your	horse	free	rein	and	cover	your	face		
i	think	that	cougar	just	came	up	over	the	rim	on	a	scouting	hunt	and	i	'm	going	to	go	down	to	the	head	of	the	trail	and	stay	there	till	morning		
when	he	reached	us	he	fell	flat	and	lay	breathing	heavily	for	a	while		
i	knew	the	outlook	was	magnificent	and	sublime	beyond	words	but	as	yet	i	had	not	begun	to	understand	it		
after	mentally	debating	a	moment	i	decided	as	it	was	a	very	harmless	joke	to	help	frank	into	the	fulfillment	of	his	enjoyment		
the	spectacle	was	too	elusive	and	too	great		
lawson	rode	in	near	sundown	with	the	carcasses	of	two	beasts	of	some	species	hanging	over	his	saddle		
a	nipping	wind	came	down	out	of	the	frigid	north	and	crusted	the	snows		
the	location	we	selected	for	camp	was	a	large	glade	fifty	paces	or	more	from	the	precipice	far	enough	the	cowboys	averred	to	keep	our	traps	from	being	sucked	down	by	some	of	the	whirlpool	winds	native	to	the	spot		
at	the	hunter	's	stern	call	the	indian	leaped	ashore	and	started	to	run		
on	awakening	in	the	morning	i	found	frost	half	an	inch	thick	covered	my	sleepingbag	whitened	the	ground	and	made	the	beautiful	silver	spruce	trees	silver	in	hue	as	well	as	in	name		
he	did	not	understand	the	significance	of	the	cry	unless	it	meant	hunger	or	the	wailing	mourn	of	a	lioness	for	her	murdered	cubs		
a	big	rattler	jumped	at	me	one	day	and	i	've	never	recovered	from	the	shock		
the	dogsexcepting	jude	who	had	been	kicked	and	lamedwere	ranging	along	before	their	master		
lank	gray	wolves	appeared	on	all	sides	they	prowled	about	with	hungry	howls	and	shoved	blacktipped	noses	through	the	grass		
there	's	four	feet	of	snow	on	greenland	said	frank		
thar	's	where	the	cougars	stay		
the	next	day	they	were	begging	at	the	cabin	door		
old	baldy	was	cute		
this	figure	i	recollected	had	been	presented	to	my	sight	more	than	once	and	now	it	stopped	me		
jones	forged	ahead	and	reached	the	top	of	the	ravine	first		
now	i	placed	our	horses	there	for	two	reasons		
jones	was	already	riding	far	beyond	the	corral	as	i	could	see	by	a	cloud	of	dust	and	i	set	off	after	him	with	the	painful	consciousness	that	i	must	have	looked	to	frank	and	jim	much	as	central	park	equestrians	had	often	looked	to	me		
on	the	outer	edge	of	that	circle	moved	the	white	restless	gliding	forms		
in	fact	moze	bumped	his	blunt	nose	into	the	rabbit		
it	did	not	take	me	long	to	relate	the	incident	of	the	mexican		
when	the	noise	stopped	and	i	looked	again	the	bear	was	a	sight	not	to	be	forgotten		
let	her	burn		
so	with	this	in	mind	i	entered	a	general	merchandise	store		
bang		
he	warned	greaser	and	herky	to	keep	close	watch	over	dick	and	me		
but	there	were	n't	any	bears	up	them	you	must	keep	out	of	his	way	if	he	comes	down	on	you		
the	sleepy	porter	was	mopping	the	floor		
thet'll	be	some	work	goin'	down	that	called	hiram		
if	the	men	were	hired	by	buell	i	wanted	to	know	what	they	were	quarrelling	about		
the	sun	had	gone	down	behind	the	mountain	and	the	shadows	were	gathering	when	i	came	to	another	large	canyon		
to	me	it	did	not	appear	much	more	serious	than	before		
it	all	brought	into	my	mind	a	picture	i	had	seen	of	the	end	of	the	world		
momentarily	we	stood	irresolute		
then	i	saw	bill	and	herky	running	up	the	gorge	and	farther	down	bud	staggering	and	lurching		
buell	's	gaze	followed	bud	's	and	his	face	grew	curious	intent	then	fixed	in	a	cunning	bold	smile	of	satisfaction		
i	'd	enjoy	seeing	greaser	swing		
this	mountaintorrent	was	about	twenty	feet	wide	but	its	swiftness	and	foam	made	it	impossible	to	tell	its	depth		
as	i	trudged	along	behind	him	i	spoke	of	dick	leslie	and	asked	if	there	were	not	some	way	to	get	him	out	of	the	clutches	of	the	lumber	thieves		
every	stone	and	log	every	bit	of	hard	ground	in	my	path	served	to	help	hide	my	trail		
them	were	life	and	movement	in	it	and	something	terribly	sinister		
must	we	hang	up	here	to	be	shot	at		
the	fire	seemed	to	make	and	drive	the	wind		
passing	down	into	a	little	hollow	i	lost	it	again		
sure	kid	thet	hole	's	full	of	troutspeckled	trout	said	herkyjerky		
i	heard	hoarse	shouts	and	saw	dark	forms	rising	as	if	out	of	the	earth		
it	was	hard	enough	for	me	to	carry	my	rifle	and	keep	up	with	the	hunter	without	talking		
greaser	came	limping	back	into	the	cabin	and	found	a	seat	without	any	one	speaking		
jerking	the	knife	from	the	log	i	severed	the	ropes	round	my	ankles	and	leaped	up		
smoke	and	dust	and	ashes	blew	by	with	the	wind		
i	ai	n't	acquainted	with	leslie	or	any	of	them	fellers	you	named	except	jim	williams		
the	run	back	was	very	swift		
dick	had	certainly	landed	hard	on	bill		
git	some	water	herky		
presently	dick	breathed	heavily	and	hiram	snored		
as	i	went	cautiously	on	i	felt	a	tightening	at	my	throat		
it	was	next	to	a	certainty	that	he	had	seen	the	lumbermen	and	for	reasons	best	known	to	himself	had	not	returned	to	the	cabin		
though	i	had	only	aimed	at	him	generally	i	took	a	good	deal	of	pride	in	my	first	shot	at	a	deer		
there	looking	down	he	saw	an	enemy	below	him	and	hesitated		
and	i	kept	saying	i	'm	lost		
instantly	i	conceived	the	idea	of	cutting	my	bonds	with	this	knife		
dick	led	me	outside	where	we	were	soon	joined	by	jim		
stockton	detailed	the	mexican	to	keep	guard	over	us		
drip		
we	rode	briskly	down	the	broad	brown	aisles	across	the	sunny	glades	under	the	murmuring	pines		
my	mind	worked	fast		
first	the	pack	fell	over	the	offside	next	on	top	of	me	then	the	saddle	slipped	awry	and	when	i	did	get	the	pack	to	remain	stationary	upon	the	patient	pony	how	on	earth	to	tie	it	there	became	more	and	more	of	a	mystery		
a	belt	carried	a	huge	knife	and	a	number	of	shells	of	large	caliber	the	winchester	he	had	was	exceedingly	long	and	heavy	and	of	an	old	pattern		
that	's	why	i	'm	givin	you	advice		
i	lay	there	aquiver	eyes	upon	the	gray	window	space	of	my	room		
dick	's	eyes	glinted	from	his	pale	face		
we	did	not	climb	the	foothill	by	the	trail	which	the	mexican	had	used	but	took	a	long	slow	ascent	far	round	to	the	left		
we	were	getting	down	into	penetier		
many	men	on	this	job	i	asked		
dick	flashed	me	a	significant	look	which	was	as	much	as	to	say	that	jim	was	growing	suspicious		
formerly	the	lumbermen	bought	so	much	land	and	cut	over	itskinned	it		
i	felt	the	skin	tighten	on	my	face		
but	i	did	not	mean	to	stay		
he	's	well	broke	said	cless		
we	'll	encourage	him		
one	bounded	leisurely	up	the	slope	the	other	with	long	ears	erect	stopped	to	look	at	me		
i	backed	down	the	slope	crossed	the	trail	and	came	up	on	the	other	side		
but	evidently	they	thought	buell	seemed	on	the	verge	of	losing	control	of	himself		
i	doubt	if	the	westerners	will	take	to	forestry		
for	the	moment	my	animosity	toward	the	mexican	vanished	and	with	it	the	old	hunger	to	be	in	the	thick	of	wild	western	life		
i	knew	him	by	his	bowlegs		
soon	we	were	climbing	again	and	i	saw	that	hiram	meant	to	head	the	canyon	where	i	had	left	dick		
with	rifle	ready	i	cautiously	approached	the	bear		
now	that	i	was	caught	he	did	not	appear	at	all	mean	or	harsh		
i	knowed	jim		
i	thought	you	were	going	to	hop	on	the	first	train	for	home	dick	you	had	another	think	coming		
dick	something	will	be	doing	round	holston	before	many	days	that	's	no	joke	you	can	bet	replied	dick	wiping	his	face		
stepping	softly	along	i	glanced	about	me	with	sharp	eyes		
the	diningroom	was	more	attractive	than	anything	i	had	yet	seen	about	the	place	the	linen	was	clean	and	the	ham	and	eggs	and	coffee	that	were	being	served	to	several	rugged	men	gave	forth	a	savory	odor		
if	he	had	not	slipped	out	of	the	room	he	had	hidden	under	the	brush	of	the	fallen	loft	or	in	a	pile	of	blankets
