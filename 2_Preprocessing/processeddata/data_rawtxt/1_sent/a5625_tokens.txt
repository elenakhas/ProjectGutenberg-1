henry	you	would	really	be	surprised	at	the	number	of	things	that	henry	knows	just	a	shade	more	about	than	anybody	else	does		
in	more	time	than	it	takes	to	tell	it	charlie	will	keep	you	right	abreast	with	themsketch	in	for	you	how	they	are	and	what	they	are	doing	and	what	their	last	words	to	him	were		
of	course	i	ought	to	have	known		
some	can	and	some	ca	n’t		
i	asked	her	which	court	she	wanted	and	she	said	it	did	n’t	matter	she	played	equally	rottenly	on	both	sides		
all	day	long	he	is	bubbling	over	with	fun		
the	letter	was	addressed	with	a	for	preceding	my	name	instead	of	city	or	the	name	of	the	town	flo	had	written	local	even	a	professional	detective	should	have	known	then		
on	the	contrary	as	the	french	so	well	put	it		
then	he	has	a	repertory	of	song	numbers	too		
she	was	a	darb		
he	will	stroll	over	to	a	tennis	court	and	stand	on	the	side	lines	at	what	i	am	sure	must	be	great	personal	inconvenience	calling	words	of	advice	and	suggestion	for	sets	at	a	stretch		
she	wrote	the	best	letters	i	ever	read		
she	served	and	called	ready	before	each	service		
two	n’s’	really		
and	after	a	conversation	like	that	i	would	go	home	and	lie	awake	and	think	if	two	persons	can	be	in	such	harmony	about	the	weather	a	fundamental	thing	a	thing	that	prehistoric	religions	actually	were	based	upon	what	possible	discord	ever	could	be	between	us		
to	me	too		
no	dead	sea	pickled	pears	i	eat	i	never	touch	a	drop	of	rue	    	i	toast	and	drink	my	pleasure	neat	the	women	i	’m	not	married	to		
oliver	oliver	had	a	way	of	dragging	his	mouth	to	one	side	by	means	of	an	inserted	forefinger	explaining	to	you	meanwhile	in	necessarily	obscured	tones	the	work	which	his	dentist	had	just	accomplished	on	his	generously	displayed	back	teeth		
a.	m.	s.no	wait	a	minutea.	s.	m.	hutchinson	not	hutchison		
he	’s	a	riot	that	’s	what	he	ismore	fun	than	a	circus		
not	mine	the	sighs	for	long	ago	not	mine	to	mourn	the	obsolete	    	with	burns	and	shelley	keats	and	poe	i	have	no	yearning	to	compete		
it	is	as	good	as	a	play	to	see	the	hostess’	face		
he	is	particularly	good	at	doing	dixie	with	one	hand	and	home	sweet	home	with	the	other	and	josef	hofmann	himself	ca	n’t	tie	freddie	when	it	comes	to	giving	an	imitation	of	a	fifeanddrum	corps	approaching	passing	and	fading	away	in	the	distance		
nor	was	that	i	found	it	overstating	things		
charlie	has	never	laid	eyes	on	the	young	man	from	that	day	to	this		
albert	albert	sprinkled	powdered	sugar	on	his	sliced	tomatoes		
golf	she	echoed		
she	was	pretty	but	the	older	i	get	the	fewer	girls	i	see	that	are	n’t		
she	was	i	might	add	kind	of	pretty		
it	is	pretty	elaborate	for	everyday	use		
there	may	be	many	more	accomplished	musicians	but	nobody	can	touch	him	as	far	as	being	ready	to	oblige	goes		
i	have	often	thought	that	henry	must	be	the	boy	who	got	up	the	idea	of	leaving	the	world	a	little	better	than	he	found	it		
i	have	known	him	to	hold	entire	dinner	parties	spellbound	from	cocktails	to	finger	bowls	with	his	monologue		
then	he	tucks	his	napkin	into	his	collar	and	sits	there	just	as	solemnly	as	if	he	thought	that	were	the	thing	to	do	or	perhaps	he	will	vary	that	one	by	folding	the	napkin	into	a	little	square	and	putting	it	carefully	in	his	pocket	as	if	he	thought	it	was	a	handkerchief		
it	seems	he	had	taken	a	pretty	solemn	oath	to	supply	charlie	as	a	personal	favour	with	a	case	of	real	gordon	which	he	said	he	was	able	to	get	through	his	high	social	connections	on	the	other	side		
it	is	right	there	really	that	they	put	their	finger	on	the	big	trouble	with	him		
but	i	mean	an	n’	between	the	i’	and	the	s.’	i	mean	it	’s	hutchinson	and	not	hutchison		
and	she	was	deeply	interested	in	me	which	was	natural	enough	as	i	had	no	reservations	no	reticences	from	her		
but	it	is	when	the	refreshments	are	served	that	freddie	reaches	the	top	of	his	form		
if	for	instance	henry	happens	to	drop	in	while	four	of	his	friends	are	struggling	along	through	a	game	of	bridge	he	does	not	cut	in	and	take	a	hand	thereby	showing	up	their	playing	in	comparison	to	his		
and	never	a	selection	that	every	member	of	the	family	could	n’t	listen	to	eitherjust	healthy	fun		
raymond	so	long	as	you	keep	him	well	inland	raymond	will	never	give	any	trouble		
one	day	i	telephoned	her	and	asked	her	what	she	had	been	doing	that	morning		
candescent	is	not	far	off		
relate	to	him	tales	of	unusual	places	where	you	have	heard	that	you	can	get	it	or	of	grotesque	sums	that	you	have	been	told	have	been	exchanged	for	it	and	he	will	hang	on	your	every	word	leading	you	on	asking	intelligent	questions	encouraging	you	by	references	to	like	experiences	of	his	own		
just	tell	him	about	any	little	formula	you	may	have	picked	up	for	making	it	at	home	and	you	will	find	the	most	sympathetic	of	audiences	and	one	who	will	even	go	to	the	flattering	length	of	taking	notes	on	your	discourse

frequently	after	a	card	has	been	played	he	will	lean	over	and	in	a	goodhumoured	way	tell	the	player	what	he	should	have	done	instead	and	how	he	might	just	as	well	throw	his	hand	down	then	and	there	but	he	always	refuses	to	take	any	more	active	part	in	the	game		
and	the	remarks	he	makes	about	the	foodi	do	wish	i	could	remember	how	they	go		
there	’s	an	n’	in	it		
yet	he	never	crashes	in	on	his	friends’	affairs		
and	that	was	her	policy	too	though	now	and	then	she	carried	it	too	far		
it	needs	no	careful	leading	around	of	the	subject	no	tactful	questions	no	welltimed	allusions	to	get	him	nicely	loosened	up		
after	you	have	signed	the	lease	for	the	new	apartment	henry	tells	you	where	you	could	have	got	one	cheaper	and	sunnier	after	you	are	all	tied	up	with	the	new	firm	henry	explains	to	you	where	you	made	your	big	mistake	in	leaving	the	old	one		
he	just	makes	them	live		
anne	is	now	the	wife	of	a	golfing	banker		
anne	    	in	winter	when	the	ground	was	white	    	i	thought	that	anne	would	be	all	right	    	in	summer	quite	the	other	way	    	i	knew	she	’d	never	be	o.	k.	she	liked	to	go	to	the	theatre	but	what	she	went	for	was	to	be	amused	as	there	was	enough	sadness	in	real	life	without	going	to	the	theatre	for	it		
she	was	glad	i	was	a	tennis	player	and	we	’d	have	some	exciting	sets	in	the	summer		
when	he	really	wants	to	extend	himself	he	calls	up	in	the	middle	of	the	night	and	says	that	he	is	the	wire	tester		
lots	of	them		
then	there	are	several	along	the	general	lines	of	casey	jones	two	or	three	about	negroes	who	specialized	on	the	banjo	and	a	few	in	which	the	lyric	of	the	chorus	consists	of	the	syllables	ha	ha	ha	the	idea	is	that	the	audience	will	get	laughing	along	with	the	singer		
i	had	dinner	with	her	that	night	at	a	restaurant		
she	told	me	that	i	was	just	a	great	big	boy	that	all	men	in	fact	were	just	little	boys	grown	up		
there	is	never	any	of	this	hanging	back	waiting	to	be	coaxed	or	protesting	that	he	has	n’t	touched	a	key	in	months		
he	is	never	at	a	loss	for	a	screaming	crack		
no	henry	draws	up	a	chair	and	sits	looking	on	with	a	kindly	smile		
but	that	now	i	think	of	it	would	probably	be	the	very	idea	you	would	have	in	mind		
among	his	new	friends	he	numbers	a	conductor	on	a	train	that	runs	down	from	montreal	and	a	young	man	who	owns	his	own	truck	and	a	group	of	chaps	who	work	in	drug	stores	and	i	do	n’t	know	how	many	proprietors	of	homey	little	restaurants	in	the	basements	of	brownstone	houses		
but	for	the	most	part	his	new	friends	are	just	the	truest	pals	a	man	ever	had		
l’envoi	    	my	dears	whom	gracefully	i	greet	gaze	at	these	lucky	ladies	who	    	are	ofto	make	this	thing	concrete	the	women	i	’m	not	married	to		
hutchison	is	the	author		
there	have	n’t	been		
for	i	have	known	families	to	be	rent	by	disagreements	as	to	meteorological	conditions		
who	wrote	it		
he	uses	that	one	only	on	special	occasions	though		
s.	she	wrote		
and	that	is	the	way	henry	is	about	everything		
he	is	never	without	a	new	story	of	what	pat	said	to	mike	as	they	were	walking	down	the	street	or	how	abie	tried	to	cheat	ikie	or	what	old	aunt	jemima	answered	when	she	was	asked	why	she	had	married	for	the	fifth	time		
she	did		
some	of	them	have	turned	out	to	be	but	fairweather	friends	unfortunately		
so	you	see	it	was	n’t	just	the	weather	though	at	that	time	i	thought	that	would	be	enough		
sorry	to	have	kept	you	waiting	she	said		
some	folks	can	drink	it	and	not	notice	it	but	take	me	i	’m	funny	that	way	and	if	i	took	a	cup	now	i	would	n’t	close	an	eye	all	night		
he	is	never	without	a	new	story	of	what	pat	said	to	mike	as	they	were	walking	down	the	street	or	how	abie	tried	to	cheat	ikie	or	what	old	aunt	jemima	answered	when	she	was	asked	why	she	had	married	for	the	fifth	time		
i	have	known	him	to	hold	entire	dinner	parties	spellbound	from	cocktails	to	finger	bowls	with	his	monologue		
now	i	would	be	well	down	among	the	last	when	it	came	to	wanting	to	give	you	the	impression	that	charlie	has	been	picked	for	the	allamerican	alcoholic	team		
all	you	have	to	do	is	say	good	evening	to	him	ask	him	how	everybody	over	at	his	house	is	getting	along	and	give	him	a	chairthough	this	last	is	not	essentialand	silvertongued	charlie	is	good	for	three	hours	straight	on	where	he	is	getting	it	how	much	he	has	to	pay	for	it	and	what	the	chances	are	of	his	getting	hold	of	a	couple	of	cases	of	genuine	pinchbottle	along	around	the	middle	of	next	week		
of	course	there	must	have	been	a	lot	of	unsatisfactory	weather	even	then	and	i	do	n’t	doubt	that	he	slipped	in	a	word	or	two	when	the	talk	got	around	to	the	insanity	of	the	thencurrent	styles	of	women	’s	dress		
it	is	as	good	as	a	play	to	see	the	hostess’	face		
you	gather	from	his	conversation	that	he	comes	into	daily	contact	with	any	number	of	picturesque	people		
but	freddie	is	not	one	of	those	humourists	who	perform	only	when	out	in	society		
on	wading	into	the	sea	ankledeep	he	leans	over	and	carefully	applies	handfuls	of	water	to	his	wrists	and	forehead		
frequently	after	a	card	has	been	played	he	will	lean	over	and	in	a	goodhumoured	way	tell	the	player	what	he	should	have	done	instead	and	how	he	might	just	as	well	throw	his	hand	down	then	and	there	but	he	always	refuses	to	take	any	more	active	part	in	the	game		
there	may	be	many	more	accomplished	musicians	but	nobody	can	touch	him	as	far	as	being	ready	to	oblige	goes		
he	always	leaves	with	a	few	cheery	words	to	the	players	urging	them	to	keep	at	it	and	not	let	themselves	get	discouraged		
but	you	just	ought	to	meet	freddie	sometime		
he	is	funniest	though	it	seems	to	me	when	he	is	pretending	that	the	lemonade	is	intoxicating	and	that	he	feels	its	effects	pretty	strongly		
to	a	fault	i	have	even	heard	people	go	so	far	as	to	say		
he	is	particularly	good	at	doing	dixie	with	one	hand	and	home	sweet	home	with	the	other	and	josef	hofmann	himself	ca	n’t	tie	freddie	when	it	comes	to	giving	an	imitation	of	a	fifeanddrum	corps	approaching	passing	and	fading	away	in	the	distance		
when	it	comes	to	giving	his	time	and	his	energy	there	is	nobody	who	could	not	admit	that	henry	is	generous		
the	party	will	be	just	about	plucking	at	the	coverlet	when	in	will	breeze	freddie	and	from	that	moment	on	the	evening	is	little	short	of	a	whirlwind		
he	smashes	the	ice	all	to	nothing	the	moment	he	is	introduced	to	the	other	guests	by	pretending	to	misunderstand	their	names	and	calling	them	something	entirely	different	keeping	a	perfectly	straight	face	all	the	time	as	if	he	never	realized	there	was	anything	wrong		
he	can	come	right	into	a	room	full	of	strangers	and	be	just	as	much	at	home	as	if	he	had	gone	through	grammar	school	with	them		
that	is	the	way	he	always	is	just	laughing	it	off	when	he	is	told	that	people	are	using	his	best	lines	without	even	so	much	as	word	of	acknowledgment		
but	do	n’t	let	yourself	get	carried	away	with	success	and	attempt	to	branch	out	into	other	topics		
and	of	course	it	gets	me	laughing	so	that	i	ca	n’t	say	another	word	about	it		
it	is	pretty	elaborate	for	everyday	use		
as	he	saysand	quite	rightly	tooit	was	the	principle	of	the	thing		
it	is	the	next	best	thing	to	knowing	these	people	yourself	to	hear	charlie	tell	about	them		
i	do	n’t	believe	any	one	will	ever	know	how	much	fun	freddie	and	his	friends	get	out	of	freddie	’s	calling	them	up	and	making	them	guess	who	he	is		
he	just	makes	them	live		
it	needs	no	careful	leading	around	of	the	subject	no	tactful	questions	no	welltimed	allusions	to	get	him	nicely	loosened	up		
you	just	ought	to	see	him	making	believe	that	he	has	swallowed	an	olive	pit		
when	you	have	seen	him	do	this	it	will	be	small	surprise	to	you	that	freddie	is	in	such	demand	for	social	functions		
when	what	the	young	man	called	a	nominal	sum	was	paid	and	the	case	was	delivered	its	bottles	were	found	to	contain	a	nameless	liquor	though	those	of	charlie	’s	friends	who	gave	it	a	fair	trial	suggested	storm	king	as	a	good	name	for	the	brand		
on	the	contrary	as	the	french	so	well	put	it		
then	he	has	a	repertory	of	song	numbers	too		
just	tell	him	about	any	little	formula	you	may	have	picked	up	for	making	it	at	home	and	you	will	find	the	most	sympathetic	of	audiences	and	one	who	will	even	go	to	the	flattering	length	of	taking	notes	on	your	discourse		
he	will	stroll	over	to	a	tennis	court	and	stand	on	the	side	lines	at	what	i	am	sure	must	be	great	personal	inconvenience	calling	words	of	advice	and	suggestion	for	sets	at	a	stretch		
but	day	in	and	day	out	you	can	depend	upon	it	that	he	is	putting	over	some	uproarious	trick	with	a	dribble	glass	or	a	loaded	cigar	or	a	pencil	with	a	rubber	point	and	you	can	feel	completely	sure	that	no	matter	where	he	is	or	how	unexpectedly	you	may	come	upon	him	freddie	will	be	right	there	with	a	funny	line	or	a	comparatively	new	story	for	you		
some	of	them	have	turned	out	to	be	but	fairweather	friends	unfortunately		
charlie	has	no	end	of	anecdotes	about	the	interesting	women	he	meets	too		
but	though	i	have	taken	up	the	thing	in	a	serious	way	and	have	gone	about	among	his	friends	making	inquiries	i	can	not	seem	to	find	that	he	could	ever	have	got	any	farther	than	that	in	the	line	of	conversation		
he	always	insists	on	helping	to	pass	plates	and	glasses	and	when	he	gets	a	big	armful	of	them	he	pretends	to	stumble		
those	who	have	not	seen	him	for	several	years	would	be	in	a	position	to	be	knocked	flat	with	a	feather	if	they	could	see	what	a	regular	little	chatterbox	charlie	has	become		
he	never	requires	his	audience	to	do	any	feeding	for	him		
he	will	say	something	one	day	and	the	next	it	will	be	as	good	as	all	over	the	city		
but	for	the	most	part	his	new	friends	are	just	the	truest	pals	a	man	ever	had		
he	gives	them	without	accompaniment	and	every	song	has	a	virtually	unlimited	number	of	verses	after	each	one	of	which	freddie	goes	conscientiously	through	the	chorus		
in	more	time	than	it	takes	to	tell	it	charlie	will	keep	you	right	abreast	with	themsketch	in	for	you	how	they	are	and	what	they	are	doing	and	what	their	last	words	to	him	were		
he	is	still	unable	to	talk	about	it	without	a	break	in	his	voice		
i	suppose	there	is	everything	in	the	way	he	says	things		
no	henry	draws	up	a	chair	and	sits	looking	on	with	a	kindly	smile		
if	there	is	a	piano	in	the	house	freddie	can	tear	things	even	wider	open		
occasionally	when	a	uniquely	poisonous	play	is	made	i	have	seen	henry	thrust	his	chair	aside	and	pace	about	in	speechless	excitement	but	for	the	most	part	he	is	admirably	selfcontrolled		
if	for	instance	henry	happens	to	drop	in	while	four	of	his	friends	are	struggling	along	through	a	game	of	bridge	he	does	not	cut	in	and	take	a	hand	thereby	showing	up	their	playing	in	comparison	to	his		
and	there	you	have	really	one	of	freddie	’s	greatest	crosses		
despite	the	wetness	of	his	conversation	he	is	just	a	nice	normal	conscientious	drinker	willing	to	take	it	or	let	it	alone	in	the	order	named		
i	never	hear	any	one	say	there	is	such	a	thing	as	being	too	goodnatured	but	that	i	think	of	freddie		
there	is	one	girl	he	often	dwells	on	who	if	you	only	give	her	time	can	get	you	little	bottles	of	chartreuse	each	containing	an	individual	drink		
but	it	is	when	the	refreshments	are	served	that	freddie	reaches	the	top	of	his	form		
mortimer	mortimer	had	his	photograph	taken	in	his	dress	suit		
charlie	it	’s	curious	but	no	one	seems	to	be	able	to	recall	what	charlie	used	to	talk	about	before	the	country	went	what	may	be	called	with	screaming	effect	dry		
raymond	so	long	as	you	keep	him	well	inland	raymond	will	never	give	any	trouble		
freddie	does	them	in	dialect	and	i	have	often	thought	it	is	a	wonder	that	we	do	n’t	all	split	our	sides		
but	that	now	i	think	of	it	would	probably	be	the	very	idea	you	would	have	in	mind		
people	steal	his	stuff	right	and	left		
then	he	tucks	his	napkin	into	his	collar	and	sits	there	just	as	solemnly	as	if	he	thought	that	were	the	thing	to	do	or	perhaps	he	will	vary	that	one	by	folding	the	napkin	into	a	little	square	and	putting	it	carefully	in	his	pocket	as	if	he	thought	it	was	a	handkerchief		
time	after	time	i	have	gone	to	him	and	told	him	that	i	have	heard	lots	of	vaudeville	acts	using	his	comedy	but	he	just	puts	on	the	most	killing	expression	and	says	oh	say	not	suchly	in	that	way	of	his		
that	is	what	people	marvel	over	when	they	are	talking	about	himhow	he	is	always	just	the	same		
i	do	n’t	think	i	ever	saw	any	one	who	could	get	as	much	fun	as	charlie	can	out	of	splitting	the	eighteenth	amendment	with	a	friend		
naturally	he	ca	n’t	help	realizing	this	about	himself	but	you	must	n’t	think	for	a	minute	that	he	has	let	it	spoil	him
