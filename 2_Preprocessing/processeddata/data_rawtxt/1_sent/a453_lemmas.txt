since	in	the	royal	horse	gunner	as	well	as	driver	be	mount	the	number	of	horse	to	a	battery	be	great	than	in	the	field	artillery	and	work	be	consequently	hard

promotion	to	commission	from	the	rank	have	in	the	past	be	infrequent	but	the	prospect	be	now	much	more	hopeful	and	in	any	case	the	noncommissioned	officer	can	look	forward	to	a	pension	which	will	serve	as	a	perpetual	reminder	that	-PRON-	time	have	not	be	waste		
there	be	today	among	all	rank	and	class	a	realisation	of	the	good	that	be	and	always	have	be	in	the	army	there	be	a	new	interest	in	soldier	in	military	movement	and	in	all	that	pertain	to	the	theory	and	practice	of	war	and	this	augur	well	for	the	future	of	member	of	the	new	army	both	on	duty	and	among	-PRON-	friend

a	recruit	join	the	army	somewhere	about	the	age	of	twentythe	official	limit	be	from	eighteen	to	twentyfive	-PRON-	be	evident	that	in	-PRON-	first	year	of	service	a	man	be	at	such	a	stage	of	muscular	and	mental	growth	as	to	render	-PRON-	capable	of	be	mould	much	more	readily	than	in	the	later	military	year

as	for	-PRON-	particular	arm	of	the	service	-PRON-	point	with	pride	to	the	fact	that	-PRON-	come	in	from	a	march	and	get	to	-PRON-	food	while	the	poor	cavalryman	be	still	fret	about	in	the	horse	line	and	-PRON-	have	no	two	set	of	harness	to	bother	about	after	a	field	day

such	a	state	of	perfection	as	this	of	course	be	possible	only	in	barracks	and	-PRON-	be	hardly	necessary	to	say	that	the	officer	in	question	be	not	exactly	idolise	by	-PRON-	man		
for	long	experience	have	demonstrate	that	the	unpractised	man	be	liable	to	be	careless	in	the	way	in	which	-PRON-	handle	a	rifle	and	the	recruit	be	at	a	careless	age	and	often	come	from	a	careless	class	be	especially	prone	to	make	mistake	unless	the	need	for	caution	be	well	hammer	home

the	way	in	which	this	be	do	in	the	army	may	be	judge	from	the	fact	that	after	a	morning	’s	parade	-PRON-	take	a	full	hour	to	clean	saddle	and	head	dress	and	render	-PRON-	fit	for	inspection
