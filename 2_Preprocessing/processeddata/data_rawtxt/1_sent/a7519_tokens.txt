s.		
petrarch	i	am	sorry	if	i	have	in	any	way	expressed	myself	arrogantly	but	if	the	spirit	is	the	true	rule	of	one	's	deeds	and	words	then	my	own	bears	me	witness	that	i	intended	nothing	in	that	sense		
but	i	loathe	and	abominate	profoundly	everything	that	conceals	from	him	the	truth	that	old	age	is	the	port	of	departure	from	this	life	and	blinds	him	to	the	need	of	reflecting	on	death

he	frequently	reasoned	about	it	with	characteristic	selfconsciousness	and	the	reader	will	note	many	allusions	to	the	subject	throughout	the	present	collection		
it	has	been	suggested	that	francesco	invented	the	latter	as	more	rhythmical	or	adopted	it	on	account	of	some	hidden	symbolic	meaning	as	four	centuries	later	young	arouet	mysteriously	chose	to	call	himself	voltaire
