the	financier	opened	the	sheet	which	had	remained	folded	in	his	hand	and	glanced	at	what	was	written	there		
it	is	sixteen	stories	up	fronting	the	street	and	there	is	no	fire	escape		
demanded	the	scientist		
i	learned	years	ago	that	no	one	could	keep	my	secrets	as	well	as	i	dothere	are	too	many	temptations		
he	was	silent	for	a	moment		
i	shall	not	pretend	to	understand	all	that	said	the	thinking	machine	curtly		
twice	the	following	day	the	thinking	machine	spoke	to	the	financier	over	the	telephone		
grayson	glanced	round	involuntarily	to	where	the	girl	sat	idly	turning	over	the	leaves	of	her	book		
he	suggested	at	last		
mccracken	co	sell	ten	thousand	shares	l.	w.	at	97		
he	asked	at	last		
miss	winthrop		
of	course		
exclaimed	the	thinking	machine		
if	you	knew	the	arrangement	of	my	offices	you	would	see	how	utterly	impossible	that	would	be	because	nothing	is	impossible	mr.	grayson	snapped	the	scientist	abruptly		
i	understand	miss	winthrop	he	said	at	last		
my	plans	become	known	to	others	almost	by	the	time	i	have	perfected	them		
then	miss	winthrop	did	declared	the	thinking	machine	finally	positively	unless	we	credit	the	opposition	as	you	call	it	with	telepathic	gifts	hitherto	unheard	of		
read	the	paper	i	gave	you	mr.	grayson	directed	the	thinking	machine	coldly		
i	am	heartily	ashamed	of	it	all	because	the	investigation	proved	her	absolute	loyalty	to	me		
the	thinking	machine	stood	staring	at	her	aggressively	as	she	opened	the	envelope	and	drew	out	the	sheet	of	paper		
bring	him	along	and	meet	me	in	the	room	on	the	top	floor	where	the	telephone	is	at	precisely	fifteen	minutes	before	one	o'clock	today		
demanded	the	thinking	machine		
i	've	got	it	he	announced	briefly		
replied	the	scientist	irritably		
my	brokers	did	n't	know	of	it	miss	winthrop	never	heard	of	it	until	twenty	minutes	before	the	stock	exchange	opened	for	business		
are	you	sure		
millions		
the	scientist	turned	suddenly	toward	grayson	who	had	witnessed	the	incident	with	frank	astonishment	in	his	eyes		
he	hung	up	the	receiver	paused	for	a	moment	to	admire	an	exquisitely	wrought	silver	boxa	vanity	boxon	miss	winthrop	's	desk	beside	the	telephone	then	took	a	seat	beside	grayson	and	began	to	discourse	almost	pleasantly	upon	the	prevailing	meteorological	conditions		
but	here	is	something	you	must	do	today		
i	do	n't	know	how	you	did	it	of	course	but	i	understand	that	you	did	do	it	so	he	stepped	to	the	door	and	opened	it	with	grave	courtesy		
the	thinking	machine	fumbled	with	some	keys	then	opened	the	way		
she	finished	the	letters	then	remained	quietly	at	her	desk	reading	a	book		
it	is	beyond	all	ordinary	things	professor		
the	girl	rose	from	her	desk	and	a	flash	of	some	subtle	emotion	passed	over	her	face		
repeated	grayson		
hatch	did	n't	know	what	was	happening	but	he	was	interested		
instead	of	sitting	however	the	thinking	machine	went	straight	to	miss	winthrop	and	extended	a	sealed	envelop	to	her		
miss	winthrop	made	no	pleamerely	bowed	and	went	out		
what	kind		
he	went	on	after	a	moment		
it	's	all	right	he	said		
van	dusen	distinguished	scientist	and	hutchinson	hatch	newspaper	reporter	were	poking	round	among	the	chimney	pots	and	other	obstructions	on	the	roof	of	a	skyscraper		
of	course		
briefly	there	is	a	leak	in	my	office		
the	last	one	left	me	at	ten	minutes	of	ten		
a	few	minutes	later	the	eminent	financier	ushered	the	eminent	scientist	into	his	private	office	on	the	street		
at	one	o'clock	the	scientist	went	on	you	must	issue	orders	for	a	gigantic	deal	of	some	sort	and	you	must	issue	them	precisely	as	you	have	issued	them	in	the	past	there	must	be	no	variation		
grayson	asked	a	dozen	questions	answers	to	which	were	curtly	denied	then	went	to	his	office		
he	paused	at	a	window	and	for	minute	after	minute	stood	motionless	there	with	eyes	narrowed	to	mere	slits		
ah		
but	when	she	finished	the	letters	she	went	out		
the	operator	glanced	about	in	astonishment		
hatch	drew	up	a	chair	and	rolled	off	several	lines	of	the	immortal	practice	sentence	beginning	now	is	the	time	for	all	good	men	the	thinking	machine	sat	beside	him	squinting	across	the	room	in	deep	abstraction	and	listening	intently		
while	grayson	sat	with	deeply	perplexed	lines	in	his	face	the	diminutive	scientist	called	upon	hutchinson	hatch	at	his	office		
considerably	later	in	the	day	the	thinking	machine	called	grayson	to	the	telephone	again		
you	mean	that	the	deal	must	be	purely	imaginative		
the	thinking	machine	sat	silent	for	so	long	that	grayson	began	to	fidget	in	his	chair		
grayson	mentioned	the	name	of	a	wellknown	jeweler		
well	who	is	in	your	confidence		
his	lips	were	set	sternly		
but	my	plans	became	known	and	when	i	began	to	unload	everything	was	snapped	up	by	the	opposition	with	the	result	that	instead	of	gaining	control	of	the	road	i	lost	heavily		
except	your	stenographer	corrected	the	scientist		
do	the	same	men	the	same	clique	appear	against	you	all	the	time	or	is	it	only	one	man		
she	demanded		
above	the	infinite	blackness	hung	like	a	veil	with	starpoints	breaking	through	here	and	there		
what	could	i	do		
the	thinking	machine	turned	to	grayson		
write	something	on	it	he	directed	hatch		
who	is	he	please		
the	thinking	machine	stood	impatiently	looking	on	watch	in	hand		
no	replied	the	financier	grimly		
i	trust	her	absolutely		
exclaimed	grayson	i	ca	n't	believe	it		
honest		
faint	cobwebby	lines	began	to	appear	on	the	domelike	brow	of	the	scientist	and	slowly	the	squint	eyes	were	narrowing		
it	would	n't	be	safe	he	said	at	last	to	leave	the	wire	exposed	as	we	have	left	it		
certainlyof	course		
so	it	came	about	that	grayson	did	not	go	to	his	office	on	the	following	morning	at	the	usual	time		
i	left	positively	nothing	undone	to	insure	absolute	secrecy		
the	room	was	still	unfurnished	save	for	the	telephone	box	on	the	wall		
from	far	below	came	the	faint	echo	of	a	man	's	footsteps	as	the	watchman	passed	through	the	silent	deserted	building		
but	now	it	is	different		
drop	in	behind	here	mr.	birnes	remarked	crisply	to	malone	without	looking	around		
i	had	to	come		
he	's	just	got	a	couple	of	handouts	an	he	passes	one	to	me	an	we	gits	to	talkin		
again	he	faced	the	tramp	 	haney	do	you	know	how	much	the	diamonds	you	had	were	worth		
		
mr.	birnes	could	n't	say		
he	waved	his	hand	vaguely	to	the	right	in	accordance	with	the	directions	of	red	haney		
the	very	type	of	man	who	would	scrimp	and	starve	to	put	all	his	money	in	something	like	diamonds	mused	chief	arkwright		
in	another	half	an	hour	the	little	bell	over	his	desk	should	ring		
mechanically	mr.	czenki	placed	the	three	spheres	and	the	replicas	in	an	orderly	little	row	on	the	table	in	front	of	him	and	the	uncut	stones	beside	themsix	seven	eight	million	dollars	worth	of	diamonds		
no		
demanded	chief	arkwright	with	cold	finality		
she	had	crept	down	the	stairs	noiselessly	and	stood	beside	him	before	he	was	aware	of	her	presence		
how	long	had	he	lived	there		
then	what	became	of	them		
well	he	puts	the	proposition	to	me	haney	continued	circumstantially	an	i	falls	for	it		
you	remember	mr.	schultze	said	something	about		
it	was	only	by	a	supreme	effort	that	he	held	himself	in	control	and	the	lean	scarred	face	was	working	strangely		
absurd		
he	turned	fiercely	upon	mr.	wynne		
kellner		
i	dare	say	the	suite	just	above	is	habitable	and	the	maid	is	at	your	service		
of	course	the	detective	resumed	the	whole	investigation	centers	about	this	man	wynne		
every	man	at	the	table	arose	and	crowded	about	mr.	czenki	who	held	a	flamelike	sphere	in	his	outstretched	palm	for	their	inspection		
haney	returned	the	gaze	dully	for	an	instant	then	suddenly	he	nodded	his	head		
mr.	wynne	even	nodded	in	a	friendly	sort	of	way	as	he	attached	the	second	strip	of	tissue	to	the	leg	of	another	bird		
in	the	first	place	resumed	mr.	wynne	as	if	there	had	been	no	interruption	mr.	kellner	here	do	n't		
i	've	been	able	to	locate	some	diamonds	but	it	's	necessary	to	know	something	of	the	quantity	of	those	you	mentioned		
and	this		
sid	down	und	draw	a	long	breath	und	den	dell	mr.	laadham	here	someding	aboud	diamonds		
he	asked		
i	must	know		
certainly		
here	was	a	long	line	of	cabs	drawn	up	beside	the	curb	some	twenty	or	thirty	in	all		
red	haney	was	submitted	to	the	third	degree		
i	demonstrate	this	much	by	the	close	watch	i	have	kept	of	mr.	wynne	the	detective	went	on	there	being	no	response	to	his	questioning	look	at	mr.	schultze		
think	of	it		
sutton	was	leaning	against	an	electriclight	pole	half	a	block	away	claflin	was	half	a	block	off	in	the	other	direction	in	casual	conversation	with	a	policeman		
in	a	couple	of	hours	now	we	shall	be	getting	an	answer		
and	his	eyes		
they	had	reason	too	to	believe	that	i	was	not	acting	for	myself	alone		
i	will	bind	myself	to	secrecy	as	you	must	i	will	guarantee	that	no	stone	from	the	same	source	is	ever	offered	in	the	market	or	privately	while	you	gentlemen	and	his	manner	was	emphatically	deliberate	purchase	from	me	at	onehalf	the	carat	price	you	now	pay	one	hundred	million	dollars	worth	of	diamonds	he	paused		
he	has	had	two	men	constantly	on	watch	at	my	office	day	and	night	and	two	others	constantly	on	watch	at	my	home	day	and	night		
wait	a	minute	my	dear	girl	just	a	minute		
but	it	's	preposterous	on	the	face	of	it	is	n't	it		
whoever	heard	of	a	diamond	as	big	as	the	kohinoor	or	the	regent	or	the	orloff	being	made		
whose	diamonds	were	they		
think	of	the	mind	that	achieved	it	man		
mr.	birnes	 	readily	understood	this	much	yet	there	was	a	chancea	bare	chancethat	he	might	trace	the	girl	on	the	l	in	which	caseanyway	it	was	worth	trying		
he	leaned	over	picked	up	a	handful	from	the	heap	and	replaced	them	in	the	leather	bag		
yep		
in	the	seclusion	of	his	home	in	thirtyseventh	street	mr.	wynne	read	the	story	with	puckered	brows	then	reread	it	after	which	he	paced	back	and	forth	across	his	room	in	troubled	thought	for	an	hour	or	more		
why	have	you	been	watched		
you	are	william	johns		
i	do	n't	know	it	boss		
then	unless	i	can	find	a	way	for	us	to	go	together	safely	we	will	throw	everything	aside	and	go	anyway		
the	workman	watched	the	snowwhite	speck	until	it	was	lost	against	the	blue	sky	then	returned	to	his	labors		
you	do	n't	understand	i	understand	it	all	she	broke	in		
i	don'd	d'ink	i	vould	yust	blace	my	hands	on	dem	mr.	schultze	advised		
he	was	tall	and	rather	slender	alert	of	eyes	graceful	of	person	perfectly	selfpossessed	and	sure	of	himself	yet	without	one	trace	of	egotism	in	manner	or	appearancea	fair	type	of	the	brisk	courteous	young	business	man	of	new	york		
a	minute	passedtwo	four	fiveand	mr.	wynne	stood	as	she	left	him	then	he	opened	the	front	door	and	stepped	out		
did	he	own	the	house		
mr.	birnes	hopeful	fingers	fished	it	out		
so	i	should	not	have	come		
he	dropped	into	a	chair	near	the	door		
queried	mr.	sutton	triumphantly		
yes	i	understand	said	mr.	czenki	impatiently		
there	was	a	question	in	his	face	as	he	regarded	mr.	czenki		
she	stopped	glared	at	him	with	scornful	eyes	for	an	instant	then	ran	up	the	stairs	again		
yes	the	chief	agreed	with	a	glance	at	mr.	birnes		
he	followed	her	with	grim	determination	in	his	face		
the	chief	stared	straight	into	the	young	man	's	eyes	for	an	instant	and	then	and	mr.	kellner	's	family		
with	certain	minor	omissions	he	told	of	the	cab	ride	to	sixtyseventh	street	the	trip	across	to	a	downtown	car	and	as	a	matter	of	convincing	circumstantial	detail	added	the	incident	of	the	empty	gripsack		
why	did	you	come	here		
he	gives	me	a	lot	o	booze	for	it	an	i	guess	i	gits	considerable	lit	up	an	he	also	gives	me	some	money	to	pay	ferry	fare	an	the	next	thing	i	knows	i	'm	nabbed	over	in	the	hockshop		
if	you	'll	give	me	just	a	little	while	then	perhapsperhaps	i	may	go	with	you		
it	's	worth	half	a	million	dollars	if	it	's	worth	a	cent		
mr.	wynne	resumed	questioningly		
well	yesblack		
the	huge	german	nodded	his	head	vigorously	with	sparkling	eyes		
he	glanced	up	arose	and	went	up	the	three	flights	of	stairs	to	the	roof		
something	like	fifty	thousand	dollars	mr.	birnes	informed	him	impressively	and	if	you	got	fifty	thousand	dollars	for	your	share	the	other	man	got	a	million		
he	called	back	to	mr.	reid	to	search	for	what	he	had	lost		
dunston	objected	because	he	is	an	egotistical	young	man	and	being	young	is	foolish		
he	returned	after	a	moment	with	the	mirror		
one	look	told	me	it	would	be	useless	to	try	to	scale	the	wall	even	should	i	decide	to	leave	my	cell	by	the	window	for	my	purpose	was	to	leave	not	only	the	cell	but	the	prison		
flesh	tints	are	daringly	laid	on	the	seminude	figure	diaphanous	draperies	hide	yet	reveal	the	exquisite	lines	of	the	body		
just	when	i	reached	the	luminous	phantom	i	disposed	of	it	for	all	time	by	smashing	it	with	a	hammer		
he	merely	glanced	at	the	papers		
do	you	think	you	've	got	enough	to	get	to	the	inn		
the	guard	went	as	directed	while	dr.	ransome	and	mr.		
suicide	was	the	reply		
here	after	a	comprehensive	squint	at	the	landscape	the	thinking	machine	entered	and	for	half	an	hour	questioned	three	waiters	there		
i	would	stand	at	my	window	for	hours	gazing	out	so	the	guard	could	see	and	occasionally	i	spoke	to	him		
curtis	shuddered	a	little		
he	glared	down	at	jean	fiercely		
fifteen	thousand	a	year	said	the	reporter		
he	could	only	conjecture	that	this	had	to	do	with	preston	bell		
dear	me	dear	me	exclaimed	the	scientist		
i	have	been	closely	associated	with	him	for	several	months	and	i	wo	n't	believe	that	he	could	have	had	anything	to	do	with	this	affair	although	i	know	positively	that	he	was	in	need	of	a	large	sum	of	moneyninety	thousand	dollarsbecause	his	personal	fortune	was	in	danger		
i	ca	n't	let	her	go	now	without	arraignment	the	detective	growled		
it	's	logic		
now	mr.	mallory	said	the	scientist	i	shall	try	to	make	this	matter	as	clear	to	you	as	it	is	to	me		
they	ran	and	as	they	ran	they	heard	the	ghost	alaughing	at	them		
how	far		
what	's	the	matter		
the	jet	from	which	the	tip	came	was	just	on	a	level	with	his	shoulder	set	between	a	dressing	table	and	a	window		
it	would	seem	from	that	said	ernest	weston	at	last	that	the	jewels	were	hidden	before	the	tragedy	and	have	never	been	found		
he	asked		
that	's	all	i	can	say	now		
what	sleep	he	got	was	in	daytime		
is	he	in	love	with	you		
and	with	a	sudden	sweep	of	his	hand	he	upset	a	heavy	chair		
i	believe	it	was	tailormade		
there	was	one	thing	on	earth	he	was	afraid	ofa	woman		
thank	youthat	's	all	said	the	thinking	machine		
he	merely	made	a	fool	of	himself	and	me	replied	the	actress	with	spirit	speaking	to	curtis		
it	was	done	because	henley	had	firmly	barred	it	hatch	explained		
slowly	the	glimmer	of	amusement	was	passing	out	of	the	squint	eyes	of	the	thinking	machine	as	hatch	looked	he	saw	a	hardening	of	the	lines	of	the	mouth		
it	was	twentyseven		
for	fifteen	minutes	hatch	silently	looked	on	as	the	thinking	machine	worked	over	the	unconscious	man		
it	occurred	to	the	warden	for	the	first	time	that	his	prisoner	appeared	haggard	and	weary		
to	a	doctor	replied	hatch		
becausewell	because	he	faltered	flushed	and	stopped		
miss	stanford	was	in		
he	said	it	would		
french	is	n't	he		
ca	n't	you	go	down	with	us	tonight		
west	was	disposing	of	the	last	bundle	when	miss	clarkelouise	clarkeprivate	secretary	to	president	fraser	came	out	of	his	office	with	a	long	envelope	in	her	hand		
he	stared	at	the	two	men	with	unseeing	eyes	and	in	them	was	unutterable	terror		
it	was	charming	to	be	scolded	by	miss	melrose	so	much	so	in	fact	that	it	was	worth	while	sinning	again		
fielding	shortly	after	seven	o'clock		
i	smashed	one	of	the	windows	and	went	through	it		
he	disappeared	and	returned	shortly	with	the	handkerchief		
yes		
the	subtler	murdersthat	is	the	ones	which	are	most	attractive	as	problemsare	nearly	always	the	work	of	a	cunning	woman		
i	do	n't	know	he	confessed		
but	he	looked	looked	with	every	sense	alert		
identical	so	far	as	i	can	see		
this	telegram	was	signed	preston	bell	cashier		
no	i	do	n't	believe	so		
he	could	n't	do	that	on	fifteen	thousand	dollars	a	year	mused	the	scientist		
of	course	it	would	have	been	impossible	for	nothing	is	impossible	said	the	other	tartly		
he	had	regained	possession	of	himself	to	a	certain	extent		
what	i	said	in	the	note	is	not	exaggerated		
i	'm	going	to	make	a	request	mr.	mallory	said	the	thinking	machine		
van	dusenthe	thinking	machine		
for	on	this	fifth	day	he	flung	down	another	linen	note	to	the	outside	guard	bearing	the	words	only	two	days	more		
they	entered	the	house	through	the	kitchen	and	the	scientist	squinted	this	way	and	that	through	the	receptionroom	the	library	and	finally	the	back	hallway		
i	knewthe	pure	logic	of	it	told	mehow	the	ghost	was	made	to	appear	and	disappear	one	look	at	the	house	inside	convinced	me	beyond	all	doubt		
therefore	it	would	have	been	impossible	for	anyone	to	peep	through	the	keyhole		
it	smelled	of	books	and	damp	wood		
no	hatch	had	to	admit		
his	revolver	lay	beside	him	with	all	the	cartridges	out		
he	ran	twenty	steps	then	stumbled	and	fell		
and	last	dunston	resumed	the	thinking	machine	and	he	pointed	dramatically	at	the	receiving	teller		
why	was	the	door	smashed	in		
has	she	fainted		
from	the	beginning	every	fact	you	know	he	had	requested		
no	engineer	would	dare	go	to	sleep		
it	's	a	lie		
i	was	anxious	to	get	the	warden	into	the	habit	of	searching	my	cell	so	that	finally	constantly	finding	nothing	he	would	get	disgusted	and	quit		
both	gas	and	electricity	are	included	in	the	rent	of	the	suites		
curtis	was	led	away	and	locked	up		
then	came	west	dunston	miss	clarke	miss	willis	and	charles	burton	a	clerk	whose	engagement	to	the	pretty	miss	willis	had	been	recently	announced
