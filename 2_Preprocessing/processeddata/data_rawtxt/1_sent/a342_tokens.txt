40:4	a	victory	that	the	phocians	under	daiphantus	had	gained	five	hundred	years	before	was	still	celebrated	in	plutarch	’s	time		
he	is	in	full	sympathy	with	the	stoics	as	to	their	elevated	moral	standard	though	without	the	sternness	and	rigidness	which	had	often	characterized	their	professed	beliefs	and	their	public	teaching	yet	of	which	there	remained	few	vestiges	among	his	contemporaries		
he	holds	the	third	place	as	nisaeus	the	second	in	aelian	’s	list	of	distinguished	drunkards		
18:1	before	dionysius	the	elder	obtained	the	undisputed	sovereignty	of	syracuse	sicily	had	been	devastated	by	the	carthaginians	and	several	of	its	chief	cities	destroyed		
the	gravamen	of	the	objection	is	how	can	that	be	just	or	right	for	the	gods	to	do	which	when	men	do	they	encounter	either	ridicule	or	condemnation	34:1	that	aesop	was	killed	by	the	delphians	for	the	cause	here	stated	there	seems	to	be	no	doubt	nor	yet	that	idmon	a	descendant	of	the	man	of	the	same	name	who	had	owned	and	emancipated	aesop	received	a	large	sum	of	money	from	the	delphians	by	way	of	expiation	for	their	crime	to	which	they	had	probably	in	the	mean	time	ascribed	every	bad	harvest	and	every	epidemic		
10:1	in	fine	one	who	understood	not	the	purpose	of	the	lawgiver	nor	comprehended	the	reasons	for	the	individual	statutes	might	enumerate	many	instances	of	foolish	legislation		
christians	were	thus	exhibited	and	murdered	on	the	stage	in	the	sight	of	admiring	and	applauding	multitudes	and	we	have	no	reason	to	doubt	that	other	reputed	malefactors	were	similarly	dealt	with

bion[52:1	says	that	god	in	punishing	the	children	of	the	wicked	is	more	ridiculous	than	a	physician	who	should	administer	medicine	to	a	grandson	or	a	son	for	his	grandfather	’s	or	his	father	’s	illness		
i	have	used	wyttenbach	’s	edition	of	the	moralia	departing	from	his	text	in	but	a	single	instance	and	that	one	in	which	he	pronounces	the	reading	in	the	text	impossible	and	suggests	a	conjectural	reading	as	necessary	to	the	sense	of	the	passage		
at	any	rate	these	festive	dialogues	present	very	clearly	his	idea	of	what	a	symposium	ought	to	be	and	in	its	entire	freedom	from	excess	and	extravagance	of	any	kind	it	would	bear	the	strictest	ordeal	with	all	modern	moralists	the	extreme	ascetics	alone	excepted

else	we	shall	throw	everything	into	the	river	of	heracleitus	into	which	he	says	no	one	can	enter	twice	because	changing	nature	is	transposing	and	altering	all	things

but	a	different	mode	of	punishment	is	assigned	to	each	of	the	three	custodians	and	executive	ministers	that	have	the	guilty	in	charge		
but	must	we	not	think	it	better	that	punishments	should	take	place	in	fitting	time	and	way	than	that	they	should	be	inflicted	speedily	and	promptly		
it	is	worthy	of	remark	here	that	the	greek	names	for	brother	and	sister	ἀδελφός	and	ἀδελφή	in	their	derivation	and	original	use	denote	a	relation	on	the	mother	’s	side	alone		
there	may	have	been	a	third	destruction	of	which	we	have	no	record	but	there	is	nothing	in	the	text	to	forbid	our	so	construing	it	as	to	leave	the	threat	still	hanging	over	the	city	and	the	third	destruction	still	impending		
as	age	advances	the	power	of	enjoyment	wanes	while	the	morbid	craving	grows	even	under	the	consciousness	of	added	misery	with	its	continued	indulgence		
i	am	therefore	troubled	by	the	saying	of	bias,[4:1	which	often	recurs	to	me	when	he	told	a	man	of	bad	character	that	he	had	no	fear	that	he	would	go	unpunished	but	feared	that	he	himself	might	not	live	to	see	him	punished		
nor	do	the	gods	visit	all	the	transgressions	of	the	fathers	on	the	children	but	if	a	good	man	is	the	son	of	a	bad	man	as	one	in	sound	health	may	be	the	son	of	an	invalid	he	is	released	from	the	penalty	due	to	his	race	as	one	taken	by	adoption	out	of	a	guilty	family		
36:3	the	territory	of	pheneus	is	so	situated	at	the	confluence	of	two	mountain	streams	as	to	be	of	necessity	liable	to	inundation		
if	i	may	use	sacred	words	here	by	no	means	misapplied	his	prime	object	was	reproof	correction	and	instruction	in	righteousness	he	evidently	felt	and	mourned	the	degeneracy	of	his	age	was	profoundly	aware	of	the	worth	of	teaching	by	example	and	was	solicitous	to	bring	from	the	past	such	elements	of	ethical	wisdom	as	the	records	of	illustrious	men	could	be	made	to	render	up

50:2	this	place	was	on	the	southernmost	cape	of	greece	now	cape	matapan

60:3	thou	shalt	love	thy	neighbor	and	hate	thine	enemy	was	sound	ethical	doctrine	equally	with	gentile	and	with	jew	until	men	saw	in	the	divine	humanity	of	jesus	christ	the	qualities	of	character	which	had	been	most	despised	transfigured	and	glorified		
but	some	persons	are	like	children	who	often	seeing	in	the	theatres	malefactors	in	goldembroidered	tunics	and	purple	mantles	crowned	and	dancing	admire	and	applaud	them	as	happy	beings	until	they	appear	on	the	stage	goaded	and	scourged	and	with	fire	streaming	from	their	gay	and	finely	wrought	apparel

relax	then	my	friend	said	i	the	severity	of	your	accusation	and	do	not	take	it	so	hard	if	some	of	the	descendants	of	wicked	and	depraved	people	are	punished	or	else	do	not	welcome	or	commend	the	honor	rendered	to	worthy	parentage		
such	chains	as	his	were	sure	to	bind	16:2	elpinice	whose	first	husband	was	cimon	was	his	father	’s	daughter	but	they	had	different	mothers		
the	most	remarkable	of	all	plutarch	’s	writings	the	most	valuable	equally	in	a	philosophical	and	an	ethical	point	of	view	and	the	most	redolent	of	what	we	almost	involuntarily	call	christian	sentiment	is	that	on	the	delay	of	the	divine	justice	or	to	give	a	more	literal	translation	of	the	original	title	concerning	those	who	are	punished	slowly	by	the	divine	being].”[xxvi:1	it	treats	of	what	from	the	earliest	time	has	been	a	mystery	to	serious	minds	and	has	been	urged	equally	by	malignant	irreligion	and	by	honest	scepticism	against	the	supremacy	of	the	divine	justice	in	the	government	of	the	world	namely	the	postponement	of	the	penal	consequences	of	guilt	sometimes	till	there	are	no	witnesses	of	the	crime	left	to	behold	the	punishment	sometimes	till	the	offender	himself	has	lost	the	thread	between	the	evil	that	he	did	and	its	retribution	sometimes	till	the	sinner	has	gone	to	the	grave	in	peace	and	left	innocent	posterity	to	suffer	for	his	sins		
thus	it	is	said	that	apollodorus[28:1	once	in	his	sleep	saw	himself	flayed	by	scythians	then	boiled	and	his	own	heart	speaking	out	of	the	caldron	and	saying	i	have	brought	all	this	upon	thee	and	again	that	he	saw	his	daughters	on	fire	their	bodies	in	flames	running	round	him	in	a	circle		
however	different	periods	of	life	make	greater	changes	in	every	one	of	us	than	they	ordinarily	make	in	cities

59:2	soli	was	a	considerable	city	in	cilicia		
aristo,[23:2	said	i	by	leave	of	the	tyrants,[23:3	took	away	the	ornaments	of	eriphyle	deposited	here,[23:4	and	carried	them	as	a	present	to	his	wife	but	his	son	being	for	some	reason	angry	with	his	mother	set	the	house	on	fire	and	burned	all	that	were	in	it		
this	might	remind	one	of	the	epicharmians	from	whom	the	sophists	derived	the	cumulative	argument,[43:1	according	to	which	he	who	used	to	be	in	debt	now	owes	nothing	having	become	a	different	man	and	he	who	was	yesterday	invited	to	supper	today	comes	uninvited	being	another	person		
it	had	its	birth	in	its	present	sense	after	christianity	had	become	the	legally	established	religion	of	the	empire	and	had	supplanted	heathen	temples	and	rites	in	the	cities	while	in	the	pagi	or	villages	the	old	gods	were	still	in	the	ascendant		
at	the	first	as	has	been	said	when	he	set	himself	against	cimon	's	great	authority	he	did	caress	the	people		
of	all	other	books	he	was	most	devoted	to	the	commentaries	of	evangelus	on	military	tactics	and	also	took	delight	at	leisure	hours	in	the	histories	of	alexander	thinking	that	such	reading	unless	undertaken	for	mere	amusement	and	idle	conversation	was	to	the	purpose	for	action		
thus	far	therefore	demosthenes	acquitted	himself	like	a	brave	man		
but	he	after	having	endured	a	siege	of	fortyfive	days	made	his	escape	secretly	and	fled	away	with	all	the	best	part	of	his	army	having	first	put	to	death	all	the	sick	and	unserviceable		
and	so	while	archias	was	discoursing	to	him	with	many	expressions	of	kindness	he	sat	still	in	the	same	posture	and	looking	up	steadfastly	upon	him	o	archias	said	he	i	am	as	little	affected	by	your	promises	now	as	i	used	formerly	to	be	by	your	acting		
over	the	small	space	of	land	which	divides	the	red	sea	from	the	sea	near	egypt	which	may	be	considered	also	the	boundary	between	asia	and	africa	and	in	the	narrowest	place	is	not	much	above	three	hundred	furlongs	across	over	this	neck	of	land	cleopatra	had	formed	a	project	of	dragging	her	fleet	and	setting	it	afloat	in	the	arabian	gulf	thus	with	her	soldiers	and	her	treasure	to	secure	herself	a	home	on	the	other	side	where	she	might	live	in	peace	far	away	from	war	and	slavery		
and	here	he	got	into	a	district	without	water	and	incurred	considerable	danger	but	by	his	resolute	and	composed	demeanor	he	overawed	the	barbarians	and	returned	after	receiving	from	them	a	large	amount	of	booty	and	seven	hundred	camels		
when	the	day	was	come	caesar	as	he	went	to	the	senate	met	this	soothsayer	and	said	to	him	by	way	of	raillery	the	ides	of	march	are	come	who	answered	him	calmly	yes	they	are	come	but	they	are	not	past		
as	soon	as	amphares	thought	she	was	dispatched	he	told	agesistrata	she	might	now	go	in	if	she	pleased		
it	is	reported	also	that	many	prodigies	happened	to	dionysius	at	that	time		
caesar	had	an	elder	sister	not	of	the	whole	blood	for	attia	was	his	mother	's	name	hers	ancharia		
next	the	thracians	marched	the	mercenary	soldiers	armed	after	different	fashions	with	these	the	paeonians	were	mingled		
the	patricians	were	content	with	such	a	truce	and	respite	for	that	time	and	gladly	returned	home	having	for	the	present	brought	off	marcius	in	safety		
for	though	lysander	's	pride	and	assumption	was	most	illtimed	and	insufferable	in	its	display	yet	agesilaus	surely	could	have	found	some	other	way	of	setting	him	right	less	offensive	to	a	man	of	his	reputation	and	ambitious	temper		
such	is	the	account	to	be	collected	from	his	letters		
tiberius	considering	the	mischiefs	that	were	all	but	now	occurring	and	having	a	great	respect	for	two	such	eminent	persons	demanded	of	them	what	they	would	advise	him	to	do		
but	when	at	the	request	of	the	gortynians	he	went	away	into	crete	to	command	for	them	at	a	time	when	his	own	country	was	distressed	by	nabis	he	exposed	himself	to	the	charge	of	either	cowardice	or	unseasonable	ambition	of	honor	amongst	foreigners		
after	many	wounded	and	many	killed	night	put	an	end	to	the	engagement		
he	carried	over	with	him	no	great	forces	of	his	own	but	making	use	of	the	cheerful	aid	of	the	confederates	succeeded	with	considerable	slaughter	of	the	cappadocians	and	yet	greater	of	the	armenian	succors	in	expelling	gordius	and	establishing	ariobarzanes	as	king		
antony	pressed	them	hard	in	great	hopes	that	this	victory	should	put	an	end	to	the	war	the	foot	had	them	in	pursuit	for	fifty	furlongs	and	the	horse	for	thrice	that	distance	and	yet	the	advantage	summed	up	they	had	but	thirty	prisoners	and	there	were	but	fourscore	slain		
while	the	rhodians	were	thus	defending	their	city	to	the	uttermost	demetrius	who	was	not	sorry	for	an	excuse	to	retire	found	one	in	the	arrival	of	ambassadors	from	athens	by	whose	mediation	terms	were	made	that	the	rhodians	should	bind	themselves	to	aid	antigonus	and	demetrius	against	all	enemies	ptolemy	excepted		
claudius	reigned	later	and	of	the	children	of	germanicus	caius	after	a	reign	of	distinction	was	killed	with	his	wife	and	child	agrippina	after	bearing	a	son	lucius	domitius	to	ahenobarbus	was	married	to	claudius	caesar	who	adopted	domitius	giving	him	the	name	of	nero	germanicus		
to	execute	so	rigid	a	law	as	this	in	a	case	where	the	offenders	were	so	many	and	many	of	them	of	such	distinction	and	that	in	a	time	when	the	commonwealth	wanted	soldiers	so	much	as	then	it	did	was	of	dangerous	consequence		
passing	the	river	lycus	he	challenged	the	romans	into	the	plains	where	the	cavalry	engaged	and	the	romans	were	beaten		
indeed	this	was	what	excited	the	wonder	of	ariston	the	philosopher	that	we	account	those	who	possess	superfluous	things	more	happy	than	those	who	abound	with	what	is	necessary	and	useful		
for	if	there	had	been	a	necessity	as	perhaps	there	was	that	he	should	be	taken	off	that	might	have	been	done	at	first	as	soon	as	he	was	taken	prisoner	for	then	it	would	have	been	the	act	of	him	that	commanded	it		
frequent	menaces	and	challenges	had	passed	in	battle	between	them	and	those	exchanges	of	defiance	to	which	their	hot	and	eager	emulation	is	apt	to	prompt	young	soldiers	had	added	private	animosity	to	their	national	feelings	of	opposition		
after	the	medes	had	been	driven	out	of	greece	cimon	was	sent	out	as	admiral	when	the	athenians	had	not	yet	attained	their	dominion	by	sea	but	still	followed	pausanias	and	the	lacedaemonians	and	his	fellowcitizens	under	his	command	were	highly	distinguished	both	for	the	excellence	of	their	discipline	and	for	their	extraordinary	zeal	and	readiness		
it	is	usual	with	the	romans	to	recommence	their	sacrifices	and	processions	and	spectacles	not	only	upon	such	a	cause	as	this	but	for	any	slighter	reason		
he	first	served	as	a	soldier	in	the	war	against	the	celtiberians	when	scipio	africanus	besieged	numantia	where	he	signalized	himself	to	his	general	by	courage	far	above	his	comrades	and	particularly	by	his	cheerfully	complying	with	scipio	's	reformation	of	his	army	before	almost	ruined	by	pleasures	and	luxury		
the	belt	which	he	also	wore	in	all	engagements	was	of	much	richer	workmanship	than	the	rest	of	his	armor		
the	achaeans	in	virtue	of	a	defensive	treaty	of	alliance	sent	to	demand	succors	as	they	expected	every	day	that	the	aetolians	would	attempt	to	enter	peloponnesus	from	the	territory	of	megara		
this	was	that	philopoemen	who	was	afterward	chief	of	the	achaeans	and	a	man	of	the	greatest	reputation	amongst	the	greeks	as	i	have	refuted	in	his	own	life		
upon	this	pompey	filling	the	city	with	soldiers	carried	all	things	by	force	as	he	pleased		
being	at	ephesus	and	finding	the	city	well	affected	towards	him	and	favorable	to	the	lacedaemonian	party	but	in	ill	condition	and	in	danger	to	become	barbarized	by	adopting	the	manners	of	the	persians	who	were	much	mingled	among	them	the	country	of	lydia	bordering	upon	them	and	the	king	's	generals	being	quartered	there	a	long	time	he	pitched	his	camp	there	and	commanded	the	merchant	ships	all	about	to	put	in	thither	and	proceeded	to	build	ships	of	war	there	and	thus	restored	their	ports	by	the	traffic	he	created	and	their	market	by	the	employment	he	gave	and	filled	their	private	houses	and	their	workshops	with	wealth	so	that	from	that	time	the	city	began	first	of	all	by	lysander	's	means	to	have	some	hopes	of	growing	to	that	stateliness	and	grandeur	which	now	it	is	at		
others	there	are	who	would	have	the	name	to	be	deduced	from	the	strokes	that	are	given	in	fight	since	even	now	in	battles	when	they	press	upon	their	enemies	they	constantly	call	out	to	each	other	strike	in	latin	feri		
philopoemen	hearing	this	not	only	laid	by	all	thoughts	of	wrestling	and	contemned	it	then	but	when	he	came	to	be	general	discouraged	it	by	all	marks	of	reproach	and	dishonor	he	could	imagine	as	a	thing	which	made	men	otherwise	excellently	fit	for	war	to	be	utterly	useless	and	unable	to	fight	on	necessary	occasions		
but	he	taking	with	him	a	convoy	of	five	cohorts	of	foot	and	five	hundred	horse	to	attend	him	home	overthrew	by	the	way	the	lacetanians	and	salting	from	them	six	hundred	deserters	caused	them	all	to	be	beheaded	upon	which	scipio	seemed	to	be	in	indignation	but	cato	in	mock	disparagement	of	himself	said	rome	would	become	great	indeed	if	the	most	honorable	and	great	men	would	not	yield	up	the	first	place	of	valor	to	those	who	were	more	obscure	and	when	they	who	were	of	the	commonalty	as	he	himself	was	would	contend	in	valor	with	those	who	were	most	eminent	in	birth	and	honor		
this	action	made	sertorius	highly	renowned	throughout	all	spain	and	as	soon	as	he	returned	to	rome	he	was	appointed	quaestor	of	cisalpine	gaul	at	a	very	seasonable	moment	for	his	country	the	marsian	war	being	on	the	point	of	breaking	out		
but	the	sacrifices	being	auspicious	and	the	time	absolutely	obliging	them	to	fight	manius	drew	his	troops	out	of	the	trenches	and	attacked	the	vanguard	and	having	routed	them	all	put	the	whole	army	into	consternation	so	that	many	were	cut	off	and	some	of	the	elephants	taken		
but	on	the	fifth	day	the	athenians	having	sailed	towards	them	and	gone	back	again	as	they	were	used	to	do	very	proudly	and	full	of	contempt	lysander	sending	some	ships	as	usual	to	look	out	commanded	the	masters	of	them	that	when	they	saw	the	athenians	go	to	land	they	should	row	back	again	with	all	their	speed	and	that	when	they	were	about	halfway	across	they	should	lift	up	a	brazen	shield	from	the	foredeck	as	the	sign	of	battle		
of	the	fifth	he	asked	which	was	eldest	night	or	day		
now	the	achaeans	suspecting	some	treacherous	designs	at	corinth	and	sicyon	sent	their	horse	and	mercenaries	out	of	argos	to	have	an	eye	upon	those	cities	and	they	themselves	went	to	argos	to	celebrate	the	nemean	games		
for	demosthenes	's	oratory	was	without	all	embellishment	and	jesting	wholly	composed	for	real	effect	and	seriousness	not	smelling	of	the	lamp	as	pytheas	scoffingly	said	but	of	the	temperance	thoughtfulness	austerity	and	grave	earnestness	of	his	temper		
the	truth	is	that	agesilaus	was	excessively	fond	of	his	children	and	it	is	to	him	the	story	belongs	that	when	they	were	little	ones	he	used	to	make	a	horse	of	a	stick	and	ride	with	them	and	being	caught	at	this	sport	by	a	friend	he	desired	him	not	to	mention	it	till	he	himself	were	the	father	of	children		
for	the	assessment	which	aristides	made	was	four	hundred	and	sixty	talents		
and	thus	on	the	one	side	not	only	those	were	disgusted	at	cato	who	bore	the	taxes	for	the	sake	of	their	luxury	but	those	too	who	on	the	other	side	laid	by	their	luxury	for	fear	of	the	taxes		
cato	commended	their	good	intentions	and	advised	them	to	send	speedily	for	their	own	safety	but	by	no	means	to	ask	anything	in	his	behalf	for	those	who	are	conquered	entreat	and	those	who	have	done	wrong	beg	pardon	for	himself	he	did	not	confess	to	any	defeat	in	all	his	life	but	rather	so	far	as	he	had	thought	fit	he	had	got	the	victory	and	had	conquered	caesar	in	all	points	of	justice	and	honesty		
and	carrying	with	him	those	whom	he	thought	would	be	most	against	his	project	he	took	heraea	and	alsaea	two	towns	in	league	with	the	achaeans	furnished	orchomenus	with	provisions	encamped	before	mantinea	and	with	long	marches	up	and	down	so	harassed	the	lacedaemonians	that	many	of	them	at	their	own	request	were	left	behind	in	arcadia	while	he	with	the	mercenaries	went	on	toward	sparta	and	by	the	way	communicated	his	design	to	those	whom	he	thought	fittest	for	his	purpose	and	marched	slowly	that	he	might	catch	the	ephors	at	supper		
and	why	depreciate	also	my	victory	and	make	my	conquests	insignificant	by	proving	yourself	a	coward	and	a	foe	beneath	a	roman		
while	they	were	coming	together	cato	walked	about	very	quietly	and	unconcerned	as	if	nothing	new	had	happened		
some	few	days	after	pompey	was	gone	out	caesar	came	into	the	city	and	made	himself	master	of	it	treating	everyone	with	a	great	deal	of	courtesy	and	appeasing	their	fears	except	only	metellus	one	of	the	tribunes	on	whose	refusing	to	let	him	take	any	money	out	of	the	treasury	caesar	threatened	him	with	death	adding	words	yet	harsher	than	the	threat	that	it	was	far	easier	for	him	to	do	it	than	say	it		
at	that	time	therefore	while	there	were	yet	great	hopes	of	an	accommodation	he	took	no	new	steps	with	his	sister	suffering	her	to	live	with	dion	's	child		
but	in	the	middle	of	this	entertainment	those	who	sought	occasion	to	quarrel	fell	into	dissolute	discourse	openly	and	making	as	if	they	were	very	drunk	committed	many	insolences	on	purpose	to	provoke	him		
gathering	therefore	together	his	friends	and	fellowsoldiers	and	such	as	had	borne	command	with	him	a	considerable	number	in	all	he	besought	them	that	they	would	not	suffer	him	to	be	unjustly	overborne	by	shameful	accusations	and	left	the	mock	and	scorn	of	his	enemies		
the	left	wing	was	commanded	by	lucius	domitius	and	supported	by	the	great	mass	of	the	horse		
and	when	there	was	afterwards	a	great	inquiry	for	it	in	the	house	and	his	wife	was	in	a	very	ill	humor	and	was	going	to	put	the	servants	one	by	one	to	the	search	he	acknowledged	what	he	had	done	and	begged	her	pardon		
for	on	the	fourth	day	after	perseus	was	vanquished	at	pydna	whilst	the	people	at	rome	were	seeing	the	horseraces	a	report	suddenly	arose	at	the	entrance	of	the	theater	that	aemilius	had	defeated	perseus	in	a	great	battle	and	was	reducing	all	macedonia	under	his	power	and	from	thence	it	spread	amongst	the	people	and	created	general	joy	with	shoutings	and	acclamations	for	that	whole	day	through	the	city		
many	when	they	saw	marius	's	likeness	cried	for	joy	and	caesar	was	highly	extolled	as	the	one	man	in	the	place	of	all	others	who	was	a	relation	worthy	of	marius		
and	fearing	he	might	be	disappointed	of	his	aim	if	troops	and	a	commander	should	come	from	corinth	before	this	were	effected	he	sent	a	letter	of	advice	thither	in	all	haste	to	prevent	their	setting	out	telling	them	they	need	not	be	at	any	cost	and	trouble	upon	his	account	or	run	the	hazard	of	a	sicilian	voyage	especially	since	the	carthaginians	alliance	with	whom	against	dionysius	the	slowness	of	their	motions	had	compelled	him	to	embrace	would	dispute	their	passage	and	lay	in	wait	to	attack	them	with	a	numerous	fleet		
for	mucia	during	his	absence	had	dishonored	his	bed		
he	suppressed	their	factions	brought	home	their	political	exiles	and	in	short	his	conquest	over	the	macedonians	did	not	seem	to	give	him	a	more	lively	pleasure	than	to	find	himself	prevalent	in	reconciling	greeks	with	greeks	so	that	their	liberty	seemed	now	the	least	part	of	the	kindness	he	conferred	upon	them		
at	sylla	's	approach	to	chaeronea	the	tribune	who	had	been	appointed	to	guard	the	city	led	out	his	men	in	arms	and	met	him	with	a	garland	of	laurel	in	his	hand	which	sylla	accepting	and	at	the	same	time	saluting	the	soldiers	and	animating	them	to	the	encounter	two	men	of	chaeronea	homoloichus	and	anaxidamus	presented	themselves	before	him	and	offered	with	a	small	party	to	dislodge	those	who	were	posted	on	thurium		
and	demetrius	the	magnesian	says	that	he	lifted	up	his	hands	towards	heaven	and	blessed	this	day	of	his	happy	return	as	far	more	honorable	than	that	of	alcibiades	since	he	was	recalled	by	his	countrymen	not	through	any	force	or	constraint	put	upon	them	but	by	their	own	goodwill	and	free	inclinations		
in	delphi	he	found	a	great	square	pillar	of	white	marble	designed	for	the	pedestal	of	king	perseus	golden	statue	on	which	he	commanded	his	own	to	be	placed	alleging	that	it	was	but	just	that	the	conquered	should	give	place	to	the	conquerors		
beyond	this	their	enemies	could	find	nothing	to	bring	against	them	but	as	soon	as	the	contention	began	with	their	adversaries	their	heat	and	passions	would	so	far	prevail	beyond	their	natural	temper	that	by	them	as	by	ill	winds	they	were	driven	afterwards	to	all	their	rash	undertakings		
the	young	tarentine	however	took	an	occasion	to	tell	his	sister	how	he	had	heard	that	a	man	of	station	and	authority	had	made	his	addresses	to	her	and	desired	her	therefore	to	tell	him	who	it	was	for	said	he	if	he	be	a	man	that	has	bravery	and	reputation	it	matters	not	what	countryman	he	is	since	at	this	time	the	sword	mingles	all	nations	and	makes	them	equal	compulsion	makes	all	things	honorable	and	in	a	time	when	right	is	weak	we	may	be	thankful	if	might	assumes	a	form	of	gentleness		
but	aratus	antigonus	and	he	having	already	agreed	upon	the	chief	articles	of	their	league	fearing	that	cleomenes	would	carry	all	before	him	and	either	win	or	force	the	multitude	to	comply	with	his	demands	proposed	that	having	three	hundred	hostages	put	into	his	hands	he	should	come	alone	into	the	town	or	bring	his	army	to	the	place	of	exercise	called	the	cyllarabium	outside	the	city	and	treat	there		
but	when	the	citizens	on	looking	about	saw	that	a	very	small	number	had	entered	they	now	took	courage	and	came	up	and	attacked	them		
thus	in	great	strength	he	repassed	the	alps	leading	with	him	into	italy	seventeen	legions	and	ten	thousand	horse	besides	six	legions	which	he	left	in	garrison	under	the	command	of	varius	one	of	his	familiar	friends	and	boon	companions	whom	they	used	to	call	by	the	nickname	of	cotylon		
of	the	rest	of	the	conspirators	with	perpenna	some	were	taken	and	slain	by	the	command	of	pompey	others	fled	into	africa	and	were	set	upon	by	the	moors	and	run	through	with	their	darts	and	in	a	short	time	not	one	of	them	was	left	alive	except	only	aufidius	the	rival	of	manlius	who	hiding	himself	or	not	being	much	inquired	after	died	an	old	man	in	an	obscure	village	in	spain	in	extreme	poverty	and	hated	by	all		
there	is	also	an	oration	of	his	said	to	be	extant	which	he	spoke	in	greek	to	the	people	in	which	he	expressed	his	admiration	of	the	virtue	of	the	ancient	athenians	and	signified	that	he	came	with	a	great	deal	of	pleasure	to	be	a	spectator	of	the	beauty	and	greatness	of	their	city		
from	the	circumstances	of	their	deaths	also	we	may	infer	some	difference	in	the	quality	of	their	courage		
hence	the	athenians	esteem	this	day	most	inauspicious	and	never	undertake	any	thing	of	importance	upon	it	and	therefore	they	imagined	that	the	goddess	did	not	receive	alcibiades	graciously	and	propitiously	thus	hiding	her	face	and	rejecting	him		
they	tell	of	pausanias	that	when	he	was	in	byzantium	he	solicited	a	young	lady	of	a	noble	family	in	the	city	whose	name	was	cleonice	to	debauch	her		
the	next	day	he	came	into	the	assembly	with	his	neck	swathed	about	with	wool	and	rollers	and	when	they	called	on	him	to	rise	up	and	speak	he	made	signs	as	if	he	had	lost	his	voice		
but	above	all	the	phantom	which	appeared	to	brutus	showed	the	murder	was	not	pleasing	to	the	gods		
the	parthians	then	to	be	sure	had	punctual	intelligence	of	all	that	passed	but	it	being	contrary	to	their	usage	and	also	difficult	for	them	to	fight	by	night	and	crassus	having	chosen	that	time	to	set	out	andromachus	lest	he	should	get	the	start	too	far	of	his	pursuers	led	him	hither	and	thither	and	at	last	conveyed	him	into	the	midst	of	morasses	and	places	full	of	ditches	so	that	the	romans	had	a	troublesome	and	perplexing	journey	of	it	and	some	there	were	who	supposing	by	these	windings	and	turnings	of	andromachus	that	no	good	was	intended	resolved	to	follow	him	no	further		
as	soon	as	he	was	informed	that	sylla	had	made	himself	master	of	rome	and	that	the	party	which	sided	with	marius	and	carbo	was	going	to	destruction	he	expected	that	some	commander	with	a	considerable	army	would	speedily	come	against	him	and	therefore	sent	away	julius	salinator	immediately	with	six	thousand	men	fully	armed	to	fortify	and	defend	the	passes	of	the	pyrenees		
he	went	frequently	by	day	into	the	bath	to	scour	and	cleanse	his	body	but	all	in	vain	the	evil	generated	too	rapidly	and	too	abundantly	for	any	ablutions	to	overcome	it		
so	dromoclides	the	orator	seeing	the	people	at	a	loss	how	to	express	their	gratitude	by	any	words	or	acclamations	and	ready	for	anything	that	would	outdo	the	verbal	encomiums	of	the	public	speakers	came	forward	and	moved	a	decree	for	delivering	piraeus	and	munychia	into	the	hands	of	king	demetrius		
and	gylippus	and	his	friends	seeing	the	syracusans	engaged	in	their	sacrifices	and	at	their	cups	for	their	victories	and	it	being	also	a	holiday	did	not	expect	either	by	persuasion	or	by	force	to	rouse	them	up	and	carry	them	against	the	athenians	as	they	decamped		
his	third	name	originally	was	not	cato	but	priscus	though	afterwards	he	had	the	surname	of	cato	by	reason	of	his	abilities	for	the	romans	call	a	skillful	or	experienced	man	catus
