i	was	half	frightened	to	death	but	i	just	shut	my	eyes	and	jumped	clean	over	the	footlights	and	landed	in	the	flageolet	’s	lap	and	then	pelted	right	up	the	middle	aisle		
he	was	sure	that	some	one	of	tom	’s	relatives	had	done	it		
the	word	sheriff	seemed	likely	but	i	could	n’t	understand	that	about	requests	then	i	thought	to	read	the	first	letters	of	each	word	like	the	acrostics	daddy	and	i	used	to	work	out	together	in	the	youth	’s	companion	and	there	it	was	easy		
do	n’t	i	strike	you	for	as	good	a	little	y.	m.	c.	a.’ser	as	there	is	in	the	business	she	looked	me	over	as	though	she	were	wondering	if	i	was	somebody	’s	darling	and	said	in	a	serious	way	my	mother	and	i	have	supper	at	home		
now	if	i	only	had	the	other	half	of	the	paper	i	’d	know	who	the	second	man	was	and	settle	him	too		
from	this	time	on	i	had	the	horrors	every	time	he	left	me		
she	pointed	to	it	and	gave	me	a	general	idea	of	the	direction	then	put	her	arms	on	my	shoulders	and	held	up	her	great	thick	lips	to	be	kissed		
so	i	waited	and	waited	in	the	hut	dying	by	inches		
then	too	that	stealin’	was	preyin’	on	my	mind	and	i	could	n’t	help	harpin’	on	it		
i	touched	off	a	musicbox	to	accompany	her	for	a	skirtdance	with	her	robes		
then	she	dropped	darn	to	bottle	myer	’s	an’	did	serios	in	tights		
then	one	christmas	when	we	were	riding	fences	keeping	the	line	up	against	the	snow	and	running	the	cattle	back	if	they	broke	the	wires	and	got	across	i	got	to	thinking	of	the	holiday	dances	at	striped	rock	and	says	i	here	’s	for	a	christmas	as	near	home	as	i	can	get	and	a	sight	of	susie	the	boss	let	me	off	and	i	made	it	in	on	christmas	eve		
he	began	to	watch	with	a	roving	eye	the	crossings	and	alleys	from	which	some	form	might	come	upon	him	unawares	and	he	cast	sharp	glances	over	his	shoulder	for	the	appearance	of	the	spirit	that	had	cowed	him		
all	i	had	to	do	was	to	hang	around	watching	for	sicklooking	strays	from	the	country		
it	was	here	all	right	a	genuine	flemish	quartersawed	oak	diningtable	all	set	and	me	going	to	have	my	first	square	meal	for	ten	days		
he	could	drive	me	off	the	waterfront	if	he	cared		
the	thumping	paddlewheels	the	phosphorescent	waves	and	the	fey	obscurity	of	the	night	wrought	heavily	upon	vango	’s	emotion	and	the	fumes	of	alcohol	mingled	in	his	brain		
in	about	a	minute	she	put	two	and	two	together	and	saw	pretty	clearly	through	the	whole	scheme		
i	thought	it	was	the	end	sure	this	time	and	i	was	ready	to	die	game		
and	i	got	bluer	than	the	light	on	the	snow		
he	felt	as	though	she	were	always	round	the	next	corner		
yer	knew	i	was	on’y	foolin’	did	n’t	yer		
we	sat	most	of	the	afternoon	drinking	cognac	and	i	got	more	and	more	pleased	at	having	squared	myself	with	them	both		
kate	will	wait	for	me	the	same	way	she	waited	for	flora	donovan		
i	was	saved		
well	it	was	funny	to	see	the	way	she	acted		
i	hate	the	smell	of	brown	windsor	soap	to	this	day		
there	were	all	sorts	of	rumours	afloat	and	nobody	knew	which	way	the	cat	would	jump		
i	on	the	bronco	breaking	through	the	crust	feeling	mighty	good	both	of	us		
about	halfpast	eight	he	woke	tom	gave	him	some	dinner	with	a	cold	bottle	to	get	him	started	again	and	spun	him	a	yarn	about	finding	him	drunk	and	robbed		
the	car	was	plum	crazy	and	nothin’	seemed	to	satisfy	the	critter		
his	eye	ranged	over	a	group	sitting	up	in	towel	robes	chatting	drowsily	over	a	drunken	satyr	thrusting	his	heavy	limbs	from	under	the	covers	and	singing	a	sleepy	tune	over	two	others	sunk	in	stupor		
he	had	on	a	wig	with	a	long	queue	and	a	gold	embroidered	costume	and	his	face	was	painted	in	a	hideous	fashion	with	his	nose	all	white	and	streaks	under	his	eyes		
what	’s	that		
i	did	n’t	hardly	dare	to	go	to	sleep	at	night	for	fear	i	’d	miss	him	and	i	was	listening	everywhere	i	went	meals	and	all		
besides	kip	being	the	principal	whiteface	actor	or	comedian	the	manager	did	n’t	let	him	leave	the	theatre	much	for	fear	he	’d	be	kidnapped	by	highbinders	and	held	for	ransom		
right	here	mrs.	schreiber	shook	her	head	indicatin’	that	i	was	travellin’	in	a	dangerous	direction		
so	with	jest	and	story	the	night	wore	on	and	james	wiswell	coffin	3d	pulled	steadily	at	his	cigars		
come	on	i	said	we	’re	going	to	borrow	dogs	and	sled	north	to	the	katakoolanat	country	for	sure	she	never	said	a	word	but	packed	up	and	followed	the	way	she	was	trained	to	do		
while	we	were	together	on	our	trips	on	the	launch	i	did	n’t	care	so	much	for	the	excitement	kept	up	my	spirits	but	as	soon	as	i	was	left	alone	i	burned	punks	in	front	of	his	little	joss	just	like	i	was	a	heathen	myself		
there	was	not	a	soul	in	sight	but	i	imagined	there	was	a	boloman	behind	every	tree		
here	was	hitched	a	pitifully	dirty	white	horse	harnessed	to	a	disreputable	covered	laundrywagon	spattered	with	adobe	mud		
you	are	good	enough	for	me		
when	he	looked	in	the	glass	he	must	have	nearly	fell	dead		
i	tried	to	settle	down	and	get	into	some	quiet	business	where	i	would	n’t	have	no	more	trickery	to	do	than	maybe	put	a	little	terra	alba	in	the	sugar	and	peanuts	in	the	coffee		
i	hardly	think	i	ever	talked	to	a	child	till	i	was	grown	up		
but	lord

his	new	companion	regarded	him	with	a	watery	blue	eye		
bryce	up	gents	he	exclaimed		
but	’e	watches	me	fyce	sharp	too	as	i	seen	in	the	lookinglarss		
my	eyes	stuck	out	like	a	fifer	’s	thumb	when	i	recognised	what	it	was		
the	filipinos	were	getting	more	insulting	every	day	and	i	suppose	it	was	only	a	question	of	a	week	or	so	at	latest		
as	he	sat	down	the	curtain	rose	and	two	comedians	entered	to	go	through	a	dreary	specialty	turn	of	the	coarsest	knockabout	description		
she	soon	perceived	him	and	came	forward	a	few	steps	while	he	retreated	as	far	away	putting	her	off	with	futile	gestures		
it	wo	n’t	do	for	the	police	to	see	it	or	any	of	the	neighbours		
i	reckon	she	had	a	new	one	every	day		
i	do	n’t	know	what	ever	became	of	aguilar	for	i	just	stood	up	in	the	window	and	cheered	as	the	boys	came	on		
she	was	myde	puffickly	at	’ome	everyw’eres	an’	flashed	’er	sparklers	an’	’er	silk	garns	with	the	best	o’	’em		
the	little	medium	broke	off	with	a	tremor	that	made	the	glasses	shake		
it	was	too	late	then	and	i	could	n’t	go	back	to	striped	rock	and	take	all	the	glory	that	was	coming	to	me	and	face	susie	knowing	that	i	was	a	fake		
the	game	was	up		
heavier	than	the	atmosphere	of	steam	and	steamed	humanity	rose	the	fumes	of	liquor		
outside	she	had	a	little	scrub	pony	waiting		
come	fourth	of	july	they	set	me	up	alongside	of	lincoln		
everybody	seemed	to	see	me	except	susie		
but	it	wa’n’t	long	before	no		
i	want	to	be	white	and	have	a	thin	nose	and	a	little	waist	like	an	american	woman		
perhaps	i	ai	n’t	got	no	call	to	boast	but	i	flatter	myself	i	found	out	what	was	lackin’	as	soon	as	most	would	have	done		
i	did	n’t	care

it	looked	a	heap	more	like	stealin’	than	it	did	before	but	it	was	rather	easier		
sometimes	i	just	felt	like	murdering	him	to	get	him	out	of	the	way		
gee		
i	ai	n’t	ashamed	of	it		
i	was	afraid	to	leave	town	because	i	wanted	to	keep	an	eye	on	the	leader	which	was	coming	regularly	to	the	public	library	and	afraid	to	get	a	regular	daylight	job	for	fear	that	somebody	from	striped	rock	would	come	along	and	see	me		
bromoseltzer	would	n’t	have	cleared	my	head	the	way	the	sight	of	him	did		
they	had	luminous	forms	and	nonduplicated	faces	that	convinced	even	the	most	sceptical
