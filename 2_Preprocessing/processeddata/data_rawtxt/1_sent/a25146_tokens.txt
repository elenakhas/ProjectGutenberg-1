tommy	said	after	a	while		
the	tiny	orange	flame	danced	merrily	leading	him	along	the	wall	toward	the	door	he	knew	was	there		
perturbations	in	the	movements	of	the	other	bodies	in	our	own	system	are	marked	and	in	the	case	of	the	first	satellite	have	proved	disastrous		
clyone	must	do	his	bidding		
pendant	it	was	on	a	scaly	and	slimy	length	of	undulating	body	that	coiled	high	above	in	the	matted	growths	of	the	jungle		
these	in	the	dome	think	he	is	with	you	now	cloaked	in	invisibility		
tommy	's	pistol	spurted	blue	flame	and	he	was	enveloped	by	the	destroying	energy		
ianito	was	saying	these	earth	men		
you	must	come	with	me	depending	on	absolute	silence	and	your	cloaks	to	deceive	them		
its	shock	was	felt	even	here	in	the	rockhewn	secret	apartment		
yyes		
of	course	not		
there	are	but	few	of	us	left	oh	earth	man	he	said	then	and	all	expect	a	like	fate	sooner	or	later		
they	knew	that	antrid	was	swinging	ever	outward	from	the	mother	planet		
a	quick	move	of	jeweled	fingers	was	followed	by	a	crashing	report		
the	pale	face	of	dantor	appeared	for	an	instant	in	the	background	through	the	red	haze	that	was	blinding	him		
     	     	     	     	it	came	then	that	explosion	and	in	a	way	entirely	unexpected	and	horrible	to	behold		
weak	and	sick	he	turned	his	head	listlessly	to	gaze	at	the	ornate	embossed	designs	on	a	wall	of	gleaming	silvery	metal		
i	can	do	nothing		
leave	'em	alone		
then	he	sat	up	on	the	edge	of	the	low	couch	on	which	he	had	been	placed	regarding	her	anxiously		
it	is	of	the	highest	importance	but	we	must	make	haste		
and	those	who	staggered	to	their	feet	were	shot	down	by	the	greenbronze	guards	who	stood	at	the	doorway		
what	's	the	matter		
farley		
she	repeated		
obviously	there	was	an	entrance	to	this	sealedin	world		
this	rulan	maiden	was	a	vision	of	feminine	loveliness	if	there	ever	was	one	a	dream		
but	he	remembered	antazzo		
they	'll	get	you	the	devils		
then	with	the	long	range	searching	rays	of	the	crystal	ball	television	and	sound	reproducers	they	discovered	the	use	of	this	kmetal		
blaine	saw	deep	concern	and	sincerity	in	the	fellow	's	blue	eyes		
it	can	not	follow	us	the	girl	explained	certain	juices	of	the	plants	provide	an	insulator	against	the	ray		
the	tritu	anu	is	empty	of	life	he	said	a	sepulchre		
in	awed	silence	they	waited		
a	gas	grenade	burst	at	his	side	and	blaine	sprang	to	his	feet	running	from	the	spreading	sulphurous	cloud		
i	love	this	carson	if	you	must	know		
boy	what	a	blast		
we	've	got	to	do	some	tall	figuring	and	some	swift	scrapping	before	we	're	through		
he	crouched	there	calling	huskily	to	ulana		
say		
now	the	one	who	had	brought	them	said	i	can	explain		
blaine	carson	was	aghast	at	the	revelation		
what	hope	can	there	be		
can	you	see	them	at	once		
you	are	a	fortunate	young	man	he	drawled	sarcastically		
dantor	whispered	swiftly	before	following	him	keep	up	your	courage	carson		
the	earth	men	are	to	be	freed	and	pegrani	will	conduct	them	to	their	quarters		
yes	two		
when	he	awoke	it	was	to	the	touch	of	ulana	's	soft	fingers	on	his	arm		
his	head	snapped	back	and	his	knees	gave	way	beneath	him		
what	can	we	do	to	put	a	stop	to	the	thing		
     	     	     	     	it	was	their	only	chance	now		
blaine	was	tempted	to	drive	a	fist	into	that	ugly	countenance	and	fight	his	way	out	of	the	place		
i	saw	a	bush	back	there	about	fifty	feet	with	bunches	of	big	red	berries	on	it		
not	with	ulana	to	fight	for		
now	it	came	to	him	that	the	dwarf	no	longer	spoke		
he	waved	them	through	with	an	indulgent	gesture		
we	do	that	you	know	we	rulans		
     	     	     	     	blaine	fingered	pegrani	's	ray	pistol	when	the	cable	lowered	them	swiftly	to	the	roof	of	a	huge	steel	cylinder	that	rose	a	solitary	and	unlovely	structure	in	the	midst	of	the	jungle	a	thousand	miles	from	ilendar		
but	ianito	is	forgiving		
i	am	a	friend	the	rulan	whispered	in	the	llott	tongue	sent	by	one	who	would	have	conversation	with	you		
silently	swiftly	they	sped	on	through	the	gloom	under	the	great	copper	shell		
okay		
but	his	wary	eyes	never	left	blaine	's	for	an	instant		
and	here	's	hoping	we	get	somewhere		
but	tommy	raved		
clyone	dropped	her	voice		
her	vitals	were	wrenched	and	twisted	groaning	in	protest		
he	faced	the	grinning	hunchbackand	was	greeted	by	a	breathtaking	spurt	of	the	pink	gas		
menacing	awful	and	then	he	stumbled	against	a	metallic	wall		
he	actually	smiled	after	a	moment	the	devil	a	smile	though	of	evil	triumph		
there	is	nothingnothing	i	tell	you		
now	they	were	in	a	lift	dropping	speedily	into	the	depths	of	the	tritu	anu		
if	only	he	could	get	in	one	good	punch		
twice	he	pressed	its	release	and	twice	the	searing	blue	flame	spurted	from	the	glass	tube	that	was	its	muzzle		
i	know	nothing	about	it	your	majesty		
hah		
other	guardsthe	big	greenbronze	oneswere	running	in	their	direction		
chalkwhite	was	her	face	and	her	lips	crimson	amazing	eyes	cat	's	eyes	pupils	redflecked	and	glittering	stared	out	at	him		
he	pushed	his	way	into	the	matted	growth	of	the	jungle		
and	i	shall	return	shortly	to	discuss	the	matter	in	further	detail		
     	     	     	     	in	his	mind	's	eye	blaine	could	not	visualize	such	a	thing	nor	picture	the	possible	explanation		
no		
murder	was	in	his	heart	and	the	urge	to	break	this	tough	guy	fenton	with	his	bare	hands		
the	lanky	scientist	outlined	the	further	details	of	his	plan	in	swift	whispers	while	he	worked	with	the	energizing	capsule	of	luke	's	garment		
sure	your	friends'll	be	there		
i	discovered	that	this	radioactivity	can	be	used	to	defeat	the	purpose	of	the	neutrorays	as	well	or	better	than	the	regular	insulation	which	of	course	we	can	not	obtain		
he	did	not	even	wince	but	swiftly	lashed	out	with	a	bony	fist	raking	luke	's	cheek	with	sharp	knuckles		
what	he	said	was	true		
kulan	fingered	the	black	tube	of	his	neutrobeam	and	his	broad	face	was	chalky	white		
one	more	day	in	this	place	and	it	'll	be	too	late	for	me		
and	the	work	of	reallotting	squads	went	on		
had	already	progressed	to	such	a	point	that	it	was	hardly	possible	he	could	recover		
five	days	in	the	sealed	cell	ten	altogether	in	the	workshop		
and	then	gannett	whirled	to	look	over	the	mess	tables	whence	a	few	scattered	hisses	had	arisen		
this	kulan	a	head	over	him	in	stature	and	broad	in	proportion	was	sure	in	his	mind	that	he	could	handle	the	redheaded	earthman	without	resort	to	weapons		
the	runway	he	observed	was	a	strip	of	yielding	metal	that	glowed	faintly	with	an	unnatural	greenish	light		
that	all	feeling	had	left	his	limbs	in	the	deepbiting	cold	meant	nothing	that	his	lungs	were	near	bursting	under	the	terrific	strain	meant	even	less		
and	the	chief	guard	's	dart	gun	twanged	as	its	needlelike	missile	sped	forth	and	drove	into	the	sick	man	's	breast	where	it	sang	its	shrill	song	of	vibratory	dissolution		
but	you	can	carry	on	the	work	go	to	my	friends	and	tell	themeverything		
and	the	longer	his	thoughts	dwelt	upon	the	things	fuller	had	told	him	the	more	suspicious	he	became		
there	was	no	way	of	beating	the	authorities	at	this	game		
you	fenton	he	snapped	ten	paces	forward		
they	stood	erect	and	moved	freely	among	the	prisoners	who	sprawled	everywhere	in	grotesque	squashed	heaps		
then	a	light	beam	flashed	forth	from	the	black	tube	and	luke	sagged	down	with	an	astonished	oath	squeezed	grunting	from	his	throat		
certainly	they	will	they	've	been	waiting	two	days		
it	was	sheer	baiting	of	the	big	martian		
you	ai	n't	figurin	on	gettin	out	today		
with	my	hands		
it	'll	be	good	for	discipline		
luke	did	comprehend	even	though	the	technical	explanation	was	beyond	his	understanding		
the	bond	between	them	strengthened		
luke	turned	his	head	but	could	see	nothing	of	their	pursuers		
luke	stared	horrified		
here	was	courage	of	a	kind	he	never	had	encountered	here	a	man	in	whose	bright	eyes	fearlessness	and	defiance	mingled	with	a	cool	disdain	that	brought	the	first	real	feeling	of	inferiority	luke	ever	had	experienced		
i	'm	licked		
kulan	the	big	martian	selected	luke		
he	dived	head	foremost	into	a	rectangular	wooden	trough	that	was	used	for	the	disposal	of	the	gangue	from	a	crushing	mill	above		
and	the	cold	was	unbelievably	intense		
luke	pondered	this		
we	merely	pack	a	quantity	of	the	radioactive	salt	around	the	capsules	in	the	lining	of	our	garments	and	the	radium	emanations	continue	the	excitation	of	the	tiny	atomic	generators	even	under	the	influence	of	the	neutralizing	vibrations		
mean	to	tell	me	you	i	had	a	reason	to	get	in	here	fuller	broke	in	mildly		
then	luke	drove	a	hard	fist	to	his	jawa	pulled	punch	so	as	not	to	betray	his	real	strength		
in	both	cases	vibratory	ether	waves	are	sent	out	and	these	are	of	such	frequency	and	wave	form	as	to	neutralize	the	antigravity	energies	originating	in	our	capsules		
with	the	radium		
the	liberation	of	the	tiny	planet	and	consequent	shifting	of	the	terminator	was	bringing	frigidity	to	vulcan	's	workshop		
but	the	loud	yelling	of	guards	back	there	in	the	pit	gave	evidence	that	word	of	the	escape	was	being	passed	along	to	gannett		
there	was	a	faint	pungent	odor	in	the	air	of	the	room	a	new	smell	that	widened	luke	's	nostrils	and	caught	at	his	throat	and	lungs		
they	're	completely	fooled	and	we	'll	be	well	on	our	way	before	they	know	the	truth		
reeling	and	stumbling	his	leg	and	back	muscles	shot	through	with	stabbing	pain	as	the	frost	worked	slowly	upward	luke	plodded	doggedly	ahead		
you	'll	last	another	period	he	snarled		
i	'll	run	him	you	mean		
his	back	straightened	and	fuller	was	swung	clear	of	the	ground		
with	legs	spread	wide	and	with	sweat	oozing	from	every	pore	he	heaved	himself	erect	straightening	knees	and	spine	and	standing	there	firmly	on	his	two	feet		
great	massed	flakes	falling	endlesslythe	moisture	of	the	mist	crystallized	and	closing	in	on	him	to	hide	him	even	more	safely	than	had	the	mists	themselves		
a	strangely	grotesque	heap	was	at	his	feettom	fuller		
they	'll	send	out	the	alarm	and	ah	that	is	where	we	fool	them	fenton		
that	working	period	was	a	highly	gratifying	one	to	luke		
they	render	our	suits	useless	but	those	of	the	guards	are	provided	with	insulating	coverings	which	block	off	the	waves	and	thus	permit	their	own	garments	to	function	even	when	the	neutrobroadcast	is	in	operation		
and	yet	these	smart	guys	luke	always	had	detestedthe	doctors	and	surgeons	and	suchthey	might	be	able	to	do	something	for	the	poor	devil		
yet	there	was	no	cessation	of	that	awful	weight	when	the	thing	was	done		
laughing	derisively	he	completed	his	ten	paces	with	leisurely	aplomb		
and	yet	he	was	content	to	bide	his	time		
fuller	's	tone	was	impatient	and	his	words	came	painfully		
in	spite	of	all	this	man	has	persisted	in	establishing	himself	in	the	vapor	belt	of	vulcan	for	the	sake	of	wresting	from	the	rocky	soil	its	vast	deposits	of	rare	ores	and	a	great	number	of	mining	operations	are	continually	in	progress		
there	was	a	new	and	utterly	unaccountable	huskiness	in	his	voice	as	he	straddled	the	prone	body	and	locked	his	strong	fingers	underneath		
you	can	get	away	yourself	alive		
anyway	he	determined	he	'd	get	the	scientist	to	his	friends	dead	or	alive	and	he	'd	see	to	it	that	they	treated	him	right		
in	the	ominous	silence	a	cracked	voice	yelped	attaboy	fenton		
there	was	much	bitterness	in	the	scientist	's	refusal	to	dwell	on	this	point		
luke	grinned	but	made	no	move		
it	's	a	trick		
the	missile	in	passing	had	carried	away	the	belt	and	part	of	the	fabric	of	tom	's	garmentcarried	away	the	capsule	and	the	radium	that	energized	it		
as	agreed	tom	fuller	came	out	first	and	luke	held	back	dragging	his	feet	and	cursing	softly	to	himself		
its	periods	of	rotation	and	revolution	are	equal	so	that	it	always	presents	the	same	face	toward	the	solar	system	's	great	center	of	heat	and	lightfor	which	reason	one	side	is	terrifically	hot	and	the	other	that	facing	into	outer	space	unbearably	cold		
that	's	right	you	big	ape	he	grated	you	ai	n't	man	enough	to	fight	the	way	men	fight		
an	occasional	shout	came	from	far	behind	where	the	guards	still	searched	the	rocky	plateau		
still	he	hung	back	scarcely	moving	from	where	he	stood	just	within	the	door		
after	three	redlit	days	of	grueling	labor	and	three	similarly	redlit	nights	of	listening	to	novak	he	reached	the	grudging	conclusion	that	escape	from	this	place	was	impossible		
luke	stood	swaying	on	those	spreadeagled	legs	and	his	lungs	were	near	bursting	from	the	exertion	in	the	noxious	atmosphere		
and	he	'd	try	to	keep	it	so		
eyeing	luke	suspiciously	the	senior	guard	grunted	then	moved	on	along	the	line		
he	protested	no	unnecessary	killing	fenton		
tell	them	what	you	saw	back	theretell	them	shut	up		
immediately	there	was	the	raucous	call	of	the	general	alarm	siren	and	a	flashing	light	from	the	bastion	that	paled	the	red	mists	to	a	sickly	luminous	pink		
mado	was	entirely	at	ease	and	the	europans	would	not	be	bothered	by	the	slight	change	in	their	weight		
mado	was	standing	now	endeavoring	to	communicate	with	the	lad	by	means	of	signs	and	the	drawing	of	crude	pictures	in	the	red	sand	of	the	cavern	floor		
his	pictures	of	the	family	life	were	meticulously	drawn		
a	great	tree	toppled	and	crashed	across	the	nose	of	the	nomad	its	roots	ripped	from	the	soil	by	the	concussion		
a	dozen	paces	away	ora	and	mado	sat	similarly	bound		
a	dusky	moonface	leered	into	his	own	horribly	close	and	he	yelled	his	rage	as	he	drove	it	back	with	a	swift	uppercut		
not	much		
imps	of	the	canals		
with	their	wisdom	they	'll	finally	get	the	thing	under	control		
carr	shouted		
oh	she	exclaimed	i	'm	glad	he	has	recovered		
oh	carr		
they	made	no	attempt	to	converse	in	tongues	that	would	convey	no	meaning	but	there	was	no	mistaking	the	quick	friendship	that	sprang	up	between	the	incongruous	pair		
besides	they	'd	be	three	ablebodied	men	out	there	to	watch	over	her	and	he	'd	make	sure	she	did	n't	get	too	far	away	from	the	ship		
there	was	a	pulsating	motion	in	it	that	he	could	hardly	define	it	seemed	that	it	massaged	his	cheeks	and	raised	the	short	hairs	at	the	nape	of	his	neck	and	on	his	forearms	as	if	they	were	electrified		
he	exclaimed	in	wondering	remembrance	trying	to	sit	up	as	he	grasped	her	hand		
carr	moved	forward	swiftly	to	face	the	opening	while	mado	stood	with	his	great	bulk	hiding	the	now	unrecognizable	nazu		
a	deeptoned	booming	note	came	then	from	the	hills	commencing	like	the	warning	siren	of	a	space	liner	approaching	its	berth	and	swelling	to	a	bombilation	of	earshattering	sound	that	set	the	steel	of	the	nomad	's	hull	vibrating	and	their	very	flesh	and	bones	atingle		
to	carr	it	seemed	that	the	diminutive	moon	winked	provocatively	as	he	turned	to	regard	it	without	the	rulden	's	aid		
they	watched	in	amazement	as	the	swift	aerial	steed	flapped	its	way	after	the	rising	ovoids		
test	samples	indicated	that	the	outside	air	although	thin	was	pure		
he	understood	remembering	the	black	band	and	the	flash	they	had	seen	across	the	cloud	layer	from	afar		
but	mado	kept	firm	hold	of	his	torpedo	tube	and	carr	fingered	the	ray	pistol	at	his	belt		
carr	supposed	that	the	thing	made	more	or	less	regular	appearances	like	a	geyser	of	earth		
what		
quickinside		
yet	he	clung	fast	to	ora	and	together	they	made	their	way	to	the	control	room		
he	strained	desperately	at	his	bonds	when	he	realized	the	awful	significance	of	their	position		
anyway	he	was	glad	the	little	fellow	had	gotten	away	he	hoped	he	was	safely	in	bedif	they	had	beds	in	those	insulated	dwellings		
he	was	growing	stronger	by	the	minute	and	now	saw	that	they	were	in	an	openmouthed	cave	and	that	mado	was	sitting	hunched	dejectedly	in	a	corner	his	massive	shoulders	drooping	and	his	proud	head	bowed	on	his	chest		
the	booming	note	from	the	hills	came	then	frightfully	near	this	time	and	the	three	ovoids	moved	with	sudden	roaring	of	their	motors	literally	hurling	themselves	skyward		
but	there	was	no	escaping	the	fury	of	that	sudden	squall	they	were	in	the	thick	of	it	in	an	instant	and	the	ship	was	buffeted	and	tossed	about	as	if	it	were	a	toy		
and	there	was	a	different	light	in	his	eyes	the	light	of	intelligence	and	culture		
four	hundred		
but	he	reached	for	the	striped	yellow	melon	atop	the	heap	and	at	a	bright	nod	of	approval	from	nazu	bit	into	its	smooth	skin		
now	as	they	drew	near	to	the	enormous	planet	it	did	indeed	seem	that	there	was	a	sinister	quality	in	its	shifting	luminosity		
my	people	already	there	with	him		
he	's	telling	me	his	name		
a	toughlooking	kid	we	've	made	of	you	too		
it	was	nazu	's	ovoid		
in	a	flash	it	came	to	him	that	these	particles	were	magnetic	the	nomad	was	covered	with	them	and	they	piled	on	ever	more	thickly	soon	weighting	her	down	so	heavily	that	she	lost	altitude		
and	indeed	this	seemed	to	be	the	case	for	the	strange	ovoids	wafted	still	lower	dropping	until	a	faint	humming	of	the	internal	gravity	mechanism	came	to	their	ears		
back	back	to	the	nomad		
devils	of	terra		
she	staggered	from	the	stateroom	and	into	his	arms	a	slim	boyish	figure	in	her	snug	leather	jacket	and	breeches		
the	body	of	detis	was	slumped	there	a	ghastly	corpse	within	those	gleaming	coils		
carr	had	laughed	somewhat	shakily	in	relief		
he	wasa	little		
somehow	when	the	vessel	landed	he	managed	to	reach	the	manhole	with	his	precious	burden		
the	viewing	port	was	completely	covered	over	now	with	particles	that	arched	across	from	rim	to	rim	slender	rodlike	things	about	two	inches	long	and	of	the	thickness	of	heavy	wire		
carr	shuddered		
they	stripped	him	of	his	silken	garment	and	smeared	him	from	head	to	foot	carr	taking	especial	care	to	see	that	his	upper	body	and	face	were	thoroughly	covered		
the	iron	hail		
the	gravity	was	even	less	than	on	mars	though	slightly	greater	than	that	of	europa		
the	little	devil		
and	then	he	was	running	toward	the	crater	's	edge	in	bounding	strides	that	carried	him	twenty	feet	at	a	leap		
ora	had	not	yet	awakened	and	carr	hoped	fervently	that	she	would	not	do	so	until	they	had	left	the	immediate	vicinity	of	titan		
she	vibrated	from	stem	to	stern	under	the	mighty	conflict	of	energies	and	they	felt	themselves	pressed	hard	against	the	floorplate		
are	you	hurt		
he	gazed	out	through	the	cave	mouth	and	calculated	their	chances		
not	if	we	make	our	visit	short		
red	men		
and	the	generator	coils	could	be	rewound		
he	's	got	it		
we	may	be	able	to	get	thought	contact	with	them		
carr	's	stomach	rebelled	when	he	looked	at	the	food		
again	and	again	carr	struck	out	but	it	was	like	fighting	a	horde	of	squirming	and	clawing	feline	creatures	that	swarmed	over	him	and	bore	him	down	by	sheer	weight	of	numbers		
there	you	are	lad	he	told	the	grinning	youngster		
what	is	it		
nose	down	and	reeling	drunkenly	the	nomad	was	diving	to	certain	disaster	on	the	rocky	ground	of	titan		
carr	dodged	none	too	quickly	to	save	his	skull	from	a	swiftflung	stone	which	clanged	against	the	nomad	's	hull		
carr	braced	himself	for	the	impending	crash	and	gathered	ora	in	his	arms		
detis	was	on	his	knees	examining	a	queer	specimen	of	purplish	moss	which	had	drawn	his	eye		
talk	with	nazu	teach	him	words	also	very	quick		
friendly	perhaps		
the	martian	exclaimed	grinning	delightedly	as	he	cast	a	swift	look	at	carr	and	ora		
might	as	well	have	it	over	with		
but	carr	was	prodded	into	moving	over	against	a	boulder	and	was	surrounded	by	a	semicircle	of	the	dwarfs	who	squatted	calmly	to	watch	him	blowguns	in	their	hands	and	stone	hatchets	on	the	ground	within	easy	reach

like	one	of	the	savages	in	his	small	stature	and	in	the	large	size	of	his	head	he	was	much	lighter	in	color	and	his	body	was	encased	in	a	snug	onepiece	garment	of	shimmering	material	of	silky	texture		
his	head	was	splitting	and	the	taste	of	blood	was	in	his	mouth	but	it	was	nothing	serious		
a	guard	of	fifty	or	more	of	the	savages	armed	with	blowguns	and	stone	hatchets	paraded	continuously	before	the	mouth	of	the	cave	as	one	of	their	number	returned	with	a	huge	woven	container	of	fruits	and	nuts	of	strange	form	and	color		
and	then	he	saw	it	the	nomad	with	its	sleek	tapered	cylinder	of	a	body	nosing	down	toward	them	with	the	silvery	aura	of	its	propulsive	energy	gleaming	like	a	beacon	of	hope	against	the	dull	clouds	of	the	satellite	of	terror
