well	mattern	say	lyddy	's	wait	so	long	-PRON-	can	wait	a	little	longer		
-PRON-	never	want	anybody	to	do	that	much	for	-PRON-		
-PRON-	never	think	of	that	the	kqyre	confess

-PRON-	be	not	a	question	of	absolute	power	or	divine	rightsimply	that	-PRON-	people	come	first	even	before	-PRON-	-PRON-	own	world	be	part	of	-PRON-	and	-PRON-	be	part	of	-PRON-	by	nature	and	instinct		
but	-PRON-	have	be	with	-PRON-	almost	a	year	now	mattern	point	out	and	do	nothing	except	talk	to	lyddy	against	-PRON-		
normally	the	starship	do	not	take	on	untrained	hand		
three	of	hesperia	's	four	planet	be	barren	rock

this	procedure	be	acceptable	in	term	of	-PRON-	culture		
-PRON-	would	better	start	get	thing	ready	for	the	trip	to	burdon		
when	the	government	protest	-PRON-	graciously	give	-PRON-	copy	free	of	all	charge		
of	course	not	dear	-PRON-	say	awkwardly		
however	-PRON-	could	not	help	be	curious		
all	-PRON-	want	be	nice	thing	and	somebody	to	take	care	of	-PRON-	and	maybe	love	-PRON-		
then	mattern	remember	the	young	spaceman	-PRON-	have	meet	come	into	the	hotel	who	seem	to	have	a	look	of	lyddy		
so	-PRON-	take	the	valkyrie	the	two	of	themand	balas	of	course	but	naturally	nobody	would	consult	a	madmanand	head	for	hyperspace		
a	technical	term		
nobody	see	-PRON-	could	ever	have	fancy	-PRON-	once	a	poor	wizen	space	rat

mattern	could	not	speak	-PRON-	be	so	overwhelmed	by	the	tribute		
-PRON-	be	more	than	-PRON-	child		
yeah	-PRON-	guess	so		
the	kqyre	evidently	do	not	know	but	-PRON-	make	an	effort	to	understand		
-PRON-	need	have	no	fear	-PRON-	add	with	a	sigh

mattern	be	somewhat	take	aback		
-PRON-	just	seem	that	way	to	-PRON-		
mattern	cry	almost	with	sincerity		
-PRON-	look	at	the	crewman
