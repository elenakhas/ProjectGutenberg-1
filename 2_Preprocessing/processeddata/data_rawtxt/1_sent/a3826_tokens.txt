we	married	james		
nussbaum	suddenly	jingled		
i	munched	it	and	conjugated	latin	verbs	in	my	head	trying	to	make	the	day	pass		
he	raised	one	eyebrow	quizzically	when	i	came	through	the	door	at	8:00	that	morning		
i	looked	up	just	in	time	to	see	two	small	figures	jetting	away	upwards		
it	's	disgusting		
your	report	card	and	diploma	are	waiting	on	my	desk		
if	you	say	so	he	said		
i	opened	it	and	read	the	inscription	he	'd	written	from	one	traveller	to	another	merry	christmas		
what	kind	of	books		
he	seemed	sincere		
he	said	taking	a	step	backwards		
i	tried	not	to	watch	them		
i	thought	that	maybe	it	had	been	on	our	bookcase	in	75	but	somehow	it	had	n't	made	it	back	home	with	us		
oly	swung	the	axe	a	few	more	times		
he	sold	a	centurian	half	a	million	defective	umbrellas	from	his	brotherinlaw	's	factory		
no	sir		
he	flipped	it	open	and	grunted	nussbaum	into	it		
i	was	too	stunned	even	to	cry	or	howl		
the	fingers	of	dawn	crept	across	my	comprehension		
i	was	about	to	tell	him	that	i	'd	keep	it	to	myself	but	at	the	last	minute	some	instinct	told	me	to	keep	my	mouth	shut		
mr	adelson	looked	up	from	my	essay		
get	your	behind	down	here	now		
oly	gave	me	a	queer	look		
mama	did	n't	get	any	less	mad	through	the	night	but	when	she	came	to	my	door	at	cockcrow	she	seemed	to	be	holding	it	in	better		
pa	's	last	trip	had	been	to	the	dalai	lama	's	court	in	1975		
that	's	fine	with	me	oly	said	and	glared	at	me		
i	guess	i	just	got	lost		
to	tell	you	the	truth	james	i	just	do	n't	think	i	'm	cut	out	for	this	line	of	work		
the	sun	filtered	down	over	me	warm	through	the	big	dome	and	i	realised	that	even	though	i	'd	gotten	myself	stuck	in	75	been	jacked	and	left	in	the	worst	neighbourhood	in	the	whole	state	i	'd	landed	on	my	feet		
there	was	the	bookcase	full	of	wild	theories	and	fantastic	adventure	stories		
i	ran	for	the	shore	and	saw	one	of	the	allen	brothers	surfacing	rubbing	at	his	head	and	laughing		
truth	be	told	i	hated	calculus	hated	isaac	newton	and	asymptotes	and	the	whole	smelly	business		
he	stood	and	walked	towards	the	wc		
some	hero	i	was		
i	walked	to	one	wall	and	laid	my	palm	against	it	the	familiar	cool	glassy	stuff	it	was	made	of		
finding	it	hard	to	relate	to	the	other	fellows		
we	will	be	studying	maths	today	in	the	seniors	class		
books		
but	in	my	mind	i	kept	seeing	my	mama	and	that	johnstone	kissing	under	the	mistletoe	and	him	sitting	in	my	pa	's	chair	drinking	his	whiskey		
mr	adelson	smoothed	his	hair	back	and	stepped	aside		
mama	it	's	a	mistake	i	began		
i	missed	the	old	me	and	felt	him	slipping	away		
am	i	right		
mr	adelson	who	was	raised	in	san	francisco	and	who	had	worked	as	a	roustabout	a	telegraph	operator	and	a	merchant	seaman	taught	the	academy	and	his	wild	stories	were	all	oly	could	talk	about		
i	plucked	them	out		
your	father	's	successor	mr	johnstone	said		
it	had	been	a	month	since	our	return		
that	was	hard	james		
i	was	near	to	tears	when	i	remembered	the	emergency	override		
i	'd	never	seen	a	schoolteacher	smoking	before		
the	flight	was	peaceful	and	dreamlike	a	slow	descent	over	the	gleaming	metal	city		
now	you	and	i	know	that	there	's	a	difference	between	smart	and	greedy		
james	arthur	nicholson		
below	in	his	seaman	's	hand	he	'd	written	james	performance	this	semester	has	disappointed	me	gravely		
he	had	n't	said	much	just	ate	calmly	and	waited	for	pondicherry	to	run	out	of	steam		
before	i	knew	what	was	happening	she	had	me	over	her	knee	and	was	paddling	my	bottom	with	her	open	hand	hard		
i	knew	enough	to	know	that	the	agencies	that	policed	the	protocols	had	their	hands	full	keeping	track	of	art	and	gold	smugglers		
the	voice	said	a	dirty	word	that	would	've	gotten	it	beaten	blackandblue	back	home	and	then	the	hands	were	gone		
nussbaum	raised	an	eyebrow	and	studied	me		
i	went	straight	home	pelting	down	the	road	as	fast	as	i	could	not	even	looking	where	i	was	going		
i	folded	up	the	waxedpaper	and	thought	about	this	adult	who	talked	to	me	like	an	adult	who	did	n't	worry	about	swearing	or	telling	me	about	his	adventures	and	i	made	my	way	back	to	class		
in	75	pa	had	almost	never	been	home	but	his	presence	was	always	around	us		
she	knew	i	did	n't	like	him	one	little	bit	and	she	said	that	i	would	just	have	to	learn	to	live	with	what	i	did	n't	like	and	if	that	was	the	only	thing	i	learned	from	her	it	would	be	enough		
i	was	engrossed	in	a	caterpillar	that	was	crawling	up	my	pantsleg	when	mr	adelson	cleared	his	throat	behind	me		
i	do	say	so		
wells		
even	on	christmas	eve	i	was	too	distracted	to	really	enjoy	the	smells	of	goose	and	ham	and	the	stuffing	mama	spent	days	preparing		
it	may	be	what	the	trade	court	decides		
she	'd	been	terrified	of	spiders	when	she	was	a	girl	and	she	told	me	that	she	had	made	a	point	of	picking	up	every	spider	she	saw	and	letting	it	crawl	around	on	her	face		
mr	johnstone	had	given	her	a	tin	of	cosmetics	from	paris	that	he	'd	ordered	in	special		
it	's	fine	sir		
i	'd	been	back	for	a	month	and	in	all	that	time	oly	had	skittered	around	me	like	a	shy	pony	always	nearby	but	afraid	to	talk	to	me		
be	that	way		
he	tousled	my	hair		
sometimes	i	said		
do	n't	say	anything	do	n't	touch	anything		
oh	a	secret		
finally	it	was	too	much	for	me		
it	's	been	a	long	day		
mama	does	n't	like	me	eating	sweets	i	said	and	stared	at	my	reflection	in	my	shoes		
he	took	them	both	and	put	them	away	in	a	closet		
no	really		
i	will	return	chet		
chet	did	n't	understand	any	of	it		
i	do	n't	want	to	talk	about	him	right	now		
my	view	stretched	8	m	down	an	impossible	dizzying	height		
the	guy	who	thought	he	was	nicola	tesla	had	an	ocean	in	his	apt		
i	've	found	the	electromagnetic	frequencies	that	the	various	coral	resonate	on	and	by	using	those	as	a	carrier	wave	i	can	stimulate	them	into	tremendously	accelerated	growth		
i	was	thinking	so	hard	i	stopped	thinking	about	what	i	was	saying	to	the	amazing	robotron		
he	is	so	screwed	up		
home	again	home	again	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	the	kids	in	my	local	bathouse	breathe	heavy	metals	and	their	gelatinous	bodies	quiver	nauseously	during	our	counseling	sessions	and	for	all	that	they	reacted	just	like	i	had	when	i	told	them	i	was	going	away	for	a	while	 	with	hurt	and	betrayal	and	they	aroused	palpable	guilt	in	me		
and	he	ushered	chet	out	of	his	apt	and	closed	the	door	leaving	him	in	the	featureless	hallway	of	the	125th	storey		
just	stay	there		
it	may	be	that	i	am	the	only	one	you	can	talk	to	here	at	the	center		
in	doing	so	he	began	to	normalize	the	experience	to	structure	it	as	a	story	he	could	tell	the	other	kids	after		
with	important	friends	you	can	make	a	whole	block	of	apts	simply	disappear	from	the	recordbooks		
i	will	be	gone	for	a	few	months	 	i	have	to	return	home		
nicola	tesla	spoke	well	and	carefully	and	i	'd	started	to	ape	him		
chet	opened	his	mouth	to	protest	and	his	father	shouted	him	down	before	he	could	speak		
yes		
the	lot	of	them	are	amorphous	indistinguishable	from	each	other	in	his	memory	all	that	remains	of	all	those	clever	little	brats	is	the	lingering	impression	of	loud	boasting	voices	and	sharp	little	teeth		
so	now	i	use	old	sparky	here	to	recharge	 	please	forgive	the	expression	 	my	connection	with	the	current		
tiny	fish	wriggled	in	the	coral	tearing	at	the	green	fuzz	that	grew	over	it		
my	mouth	is	pasty	and	salty	and	sweat	keeps	running	down	into	my	eyes		
he	whirled	on	me		
i	take	roomservice	pizza	and	beer	in	an	icebucket	pretentious	but	better	than	sharing	a	diningroom	with	the	menagerie		
it	helps		
the	cabby	is	n't	even	out	of	breath	when	we	pull	up	at	the	royal	york	which	thankfully	is	still	clothed	in	its	ancient	dressed	stone		
the	records	say	that	the	locks	have	never	been	used	the	doors	never	opened		
and	i	heard	nothing		
he	's	eleven	and	it	's	the	tencennial	of	the	ascension	of	his	homeworld	 	dirty	blue	ball	so	unworthy	yet	 	inducted	into	the	galactic	fraternity	and	the	infinite	compassion	of	the	bugouts		
i	have	n't	been	paying	much	attention	lately		
batty		
i	've	come	here	to	get	away	from	all	the	treachery	the	deceit	the	filthy	pursuit	of	the	dollar		
you	know	like	the	whole	fricken	thing		
if	water	gets	into	the	mask	just	push	at	the	top	and	blow	out	through	your	nose		
hell	it	was	the	first	time	he	'd	expressed	any	opinion	about	anything	i	'd	said		
my	parents	gamely	tried	to	explain	why	we	were	going	but	they	never	understood	no	more	than	any	human	could		
i	've	got	ta	blow	k		
i	've	used	this	trick	on	my	kids		
which	is	so	stupid	'cause	the	ceilings	in	our	old	house	were	n't	no	higher	than	the	ceilings	here	and	besides	dad	screwed	up	all	the	plaster	when	he	was	trying	to	fix	it	up	and	it	was	always	cracking		
i	do	n't	think	i	wanna	be	a	pilot	no	more		
that	may	be	true	chet		
no	i	have	n't		
have	you	thought	about	any	other	possibilities		
it	wo	n't	be	searched	when	they	evacuate	the	bathouse		
but	by	the	time	i	take	my	second	bite	it	's	just	pizza	and	a	brew		
well	there	you	are		
i	suggest	that	you	start	by	examining	your	friends		
he	spoke	as	he	tinkered	with	his	apparatus	which	hummed	alarmingly	and	occasionally	sent	a	tortured	arc	of	electricity	into	the	guy	who	thought	he	was	nicola	tesla	's	chest		
and	the	ball	whipped	up	and	away	spearing	itself	on	the	point	of	one	of	the	towers	on	the	opposite	side	of	the	room		
i	'm	fine	chet	said		
chet	's	father	stooped	and	took	the	remote	out	of	chet	's	hands	and	opened	up	a	bookmarked	docudrama	about	the	coming	of	the	bugouts		
he	's	batshit	 	he	gets	angry	too	easy		
the	only	sound	was	my	breathing	and	distant	metallic	pink!s	from	the	ocean	's	depths		
i	just	do	n't	care	about	them	to	be	frank		
how	have	you	been		
one	of	my	buds	tole	me	that	you	end	up	all	fugged	up	with	time	an	that	that	you	come	home	an	it	's	the	next	century	an	everyone	you	know	is	dead		
chet	chet	chet		
he	must	have	dozed	because	the	next	thing	he	knew	he	was	tipping	over	backwards	into	the	apt	and	the	guy	who	thought	he	was	nicola	tesla	was	standing	over	him	concerned

you	see		
i	smiled	a	huge	grin	and	it	broke	the	seal	on	my	mask	filling	it	with	water		
worried	about	uh	the	future		
i	climbed	into	the	ocean	and	the	silence	embraced	me	and	the	water	tingled	with	electricity	and	my	consciousness	floated	away	from	my	body	and	soared	over	an	alien	world		
i	ca	n't	remember		
no	no		
chet	's	mother	dropped	a	plastic	tumbler	which	bounced	twice	and	rolled	to	chet	's	toe		
you	ca	n't	imagine	how	long	i	've	waited	to	show	that	trick	to	someone		
my	pulse	beat	under	my	skin		
a	narrow	elegant	angelfish	swam	directly	beneath	me	and	tickled	my	belly	with	one	of	its	fins	as	it	passed	under		
never	mind	that		
the	little	one	needs	the	big	one	so	that	he	can	feel	useful		
he	said	his	voice	muffled	by	the	hood		
you	know	how	worried	your	mother	was		
i	entered	his	apt	and	even	my	feet	were	too	surprised	to	go	on		
think	of	it	as	a	trick	i	do	if	it	makes	you	feel	better		
you	're	progressing	nicely		
it	has	the	smell	of	a	million	transient	guests	aftershaves	and	perfumes	and	pheromones	and	the	stale	recirc	air	i	remember	so	well		
the	bathouse	breathed	around	him	a	million	farts	and	snores	and	whispered	words		
i	've	been	ok	have	you	been	studying	mathematics	and	physics		
i	spent	an	age	in	the	water	holding	my	breath	chasing	the	fish	disembodied	a	consciousness	on	tour	on	an	alien	world		
that	was	four		
he	pointed	at	the	dormer	windows	in	the	top	room		
he	was	naked	and	hard	and	he	had	the	knife	in	his	fist	not	like	for	slicing	but	for	stabbing	and	his	eyes	were	red	from	the	smoke	at	the	club	and	the	bathroom	filled	with	the	boozebreath	smell	and	i	sank	down	in	the	tub	shrinking	away	from	him	as	he	grabbed	for	me		
david	said	glaring	at	him		
they	all	had	big	shoulders	and	clothing	that	looked	like	the	kind	of	thing	the	hasids	wore	black	and	sober		
he	was	delighted	by	the	dumpsters	full	of	plush	toys	by	the	lightly	used	office	furniture	by	the	technical	books	and	the	cds	of	last	year	's	software		
it	hurt	so	much	i	bit	through	two	thicknesses	of	towel		
krishna	had	his	hand	down	the	little	girl	's	top	now	cupping	her	breast	then	laughing	when	she	slapped	it	away		
the	guy	was	slightly	asianlooking	tall	with	a	sharp	suit	that	managed	to	look	casual	and	expensive	at	the	same	time		
they	work	kurt	said		
he	wrote	about	drugs	not	on	drugs		
you	know	as	well	as	i	do		
she	tenderly	stroked	his	hair	until	the	hiccups	subsided	then	clawed	at	his	belly	again	sending	him	rolling	through	the	mud		
alan	pondered	its	crusty	clawed	form	thinking	that	it	looked	like	it	belonged	to	someone	 	some*thing	 	else		
they	're	not	like	other	people		
alan	said		
alan	pursed	his	lips	and	watched	kurt	prod	at	the	keyboard		
you	're		
she	repeated	it	and	on	the	fourth	try	she	got	the	idea	of	using	the	match	to	light	all	the	remaining	matches	in	the	folder	and	drop	that	into	the	bin		
they	ate	their	lunches	together	again	and	she	filled	the	silence	with	a	running	commentary	of	the	deficiencies	of	the	sandwich	her	father	had	packed	her	the	strange	odors	coming	from	the	brown	bag	that	alan	had	brought	filled	with	winter	mushrooms	and	some	soggy	bread	and	cheese	and	the	hairiness	of	the	mole	on	the	lunch	lady	's	chin		
the	golems	cave	was	lined	with	small	bones	and	skulls	rank	and	row	climbing	the	walls	twined	with	dried	grasses	in	ascending	geometries		
got	to	get	him	home	alan	said	lifting	benny	up	with	a	grunt		
he	thrashed	like	a	raccoon	in	a	trap	and	alan	forced	the	back	of	his	head	down	so	that	his	face	was	mashed	against	the	cool	floor	muffling	his	cries		
your	brother		
alan	asked		
alan	said		
you	should	try	the	icepack	again	he	said	weakly		
at	first	the	sound	was	barely	audible	a	soughing	through	the	tunnels	but	gradually	the	echoes	chased	each	other	round	the	great	cavern	and	across	the	still	dark	surface	of	the	lake	and	then	a	voice	illusive	as	a	face	in	the	clouds		
he	could	n't	say	the	words		
she	said	after	they	'd	watched	a	jackrabbit	hop	up	the	mountainside	and	disappear	into	the	woods		
she	looked	up	in	alarm		
alan	was	still	young	and	had	a	penchant	for	the	dramatic	so	he	went	around	to	the	kitchen	and	pulled	a	bottle	of	vodka	out	of	the	freezer	and	banged	it	down	on	the	counter	pouring	out	four	shots		
alan	held	the	knife	tighter		
billy	got	big	enough	to	walk	then	big	enough	to	pick	mushrooms	then	big	enough	to	chase	squirrels		
he	scrabbled	to	fit	his	chubby	hand	into	his	jacket	's	pocket	then	fished	out	a	little	black	pebble		
we	're	trying	to	raise	bus	fare	to	burning	man		
sometimes	for	weeks		
he	crossed	the	room	and	sat	on	the	other	end	of	the	sofa	his	hand	on	the	seam	that	joined	the	two	halves	together	crossing	the	border	into	her	territory	an	invitation	that	could	be	refused	without	awkwardness		
she	looked	glumly	at	the	road	unraveling	before	them	grey	and	hissing	with	rain		
his	body	bucked	of	its	own	accord	and	he	knocked	danny	loose	of	his	legs		
he	had	a	sense	that	he	was	n't	welcome	there	that	it	was	not	intended	for	his	consumption		
the	first	time	they	just	stood	in	silence	wiping	their	cramped	hands	on	their	thighs		
i	know	it	's	hard	for	you	she	squeezed	his	hand		
they	were	all	poor	students	so	none	of		
them	had	landline	numbers	you	could	look	up	in	the	phone	book		
but	that	was	okay	since	they	all	had	accounts	with	the	video		
store	where	she	worked	with	their	deadbeat	prepaid	mobile		
numbers	listed		
for	the	first	time	he	could	remember	she	looked	flustered		
she	nodded		
that	's	not	normal		
to	tell	him	if	this	demo	fails	it	's	because	you	fucked	off	and	left	it	to	the	last	minute		
from	the	trash	mostly		
your	brother		
you	're	invited		
he	thought	he	'd	figured	out	how	to	fit	in	that	he	'd	observed	people	to	the	point	that	he	could	be	one	but	he	was	so	wrong		
for	a	second	alan	harbored	a	germ	of	hope	that	he	'd	bested	krishna	and	so	scared	him	into	leaving	him	alone		
you	live	here		
alan	leaned	in	and	saw	that	it	was	a	milkweed	pod		
alan	looked	to	his	neighbors	porch		
quiet	dewayne	said		
alan	put	his	hands	over	his	face	and	sobbed	because	he	'd	failed	his	responsibilities	as	eldest	of	their	family	and	there	was	no	one	he	could	tell	his	woes	to		
alan	patiently	picked	dripping	edward	up	and	put	him	over	one	shoulder	and	gave	frederick	the	tube	to	suck		
he	'd	rehearsed	what	he	'd	say	to	her	all	morning	do	you	believe	me		
i	thought	about	using	it	on	him	too	but	only	for	a	second		
it	's	all	right	she	said	coldly		
i	got	a	crummy	little	basement	in	what	the	landlord	called	cabbagetown	but	what	was	really	regent	park	and	i	switched	out	to	a	huge	anonymous	high	school	to	finish	school		
he	gave	alan	a	dirty	look	as	though	his	insistence	on	preflighting	were	the	root	of	their	problems		
i	walked	back	here	from	eglinton		
shopkeepers	smiled	and	nodded	shoppers	mouthed	so	cute	to	each	other		
he	forked	up	the	rest	of	his	omelet	looked	reflexively	up	at	the	blinkenlights	on	the	ap	over	the	greek	's	sign	just	above	the	apostrophe	where	he	'd	nailed	it	up	two	months	before		
geography		
i	was	just	minding	my	own	business	and	you	came	by	i	just	did	n't	want	to	be	bothered	this	is	my	place		
wait		
i	picked	my	way	out	of	the	water	again	and	i	walked	to	the	shore	and	it	was	too	dark	to	put	on	my	clothes	so	i	carried	them	under	one	arm	and	felt	my	way	back	to	the	summer	cave	and	leaned	against	my	mother	and	waited	to	drip	dry		
they	ca	n't	even	steal	my	stuff	because	when	they	try	when	they	come	for	my	shoes	or	my	food	in	the	night	i	'm	always	awake	and	watching	them	and	just	shaking	my	head		
something	moved	in	the	bushes	moved	into	his	line	of	sight		
they	started	walking	now	billy	's	limp	more	pronounced		
benny	took	a	step	off	the	hill		
yeah	he	said		
right	alan	said	sipping	his	coffee		
we	could	use	a	focused	antenna	but	if	i	move	a	little	bit	off	the	beam	 	he	nudged	the	coffee	cup	to	one	side	 	we	're	dead		
i	'm	not	poor		
his	shout	had	drawn	older	librarians	from	receiving	areas	and	offices	behind	the	counter	women	with	the	look	of	persons	accustomed	to	terminating	children	's	mischief	and	ejecting	rowdy	drunks	with	equal	aplomb		
he	took	another	step	closer	and	he	must	have	triggered	a	motion	sensor	because	the	porch	light	switched	on		
the	sound	made	his	neck	prickle	and	when	he	looked	at	the	little	ones	he	saw	that	their	eyes	were	rolling	crazily		
davey	's	murder	was	still	to	come
