everybody	took	it	for	granted	that	we	wanted	all	murder	stopped		
and	of	course	certain	machines	were	living		
the	watchbirds	tried	to	guard	their	other	charges		
have	n't	we	learned	yet		
new	information	had	crossed	the	invisible	network	that	connected	all	watchbirds		
i	've	been	thinking	of	getting	out	of	watchbird		
he	still	was	n't	thinking	of	anything	as	he	took	aim	and	was	knocked	off	his	feet		
new	acts	to	stop	damn	you	git	going		
he	leaned	back	and	inhaled	deeply		
slaughterhouses	in	chicago	stopped	and	cattle	starved	to	death	in	their	pens	because	farmers	in	the	midwest	could	n't	cut	hay	or	harvest	grain		
it	responded	to	its	stimuli	whenever	they	came	and	whatever	their	source		
the	intercom	buzzed	again	and	gelsen	irritably	punched	a	button		
they	wo	n't	allow	farmers	to	break	ground	for	plowing		
we	must	hurry		
and	you	tell	me	they	'll	wear	out	in	six	months	or	a	year		
with	their	high	speed	and	superfast	senses	the	watchbirds	got	around	quickly		
hunters	sat	home	glaring	at	the	silver	dots	in	the	sky	longing	to	shoot	them	down		
but	still	sometimes	i	feel	like	the	man	who	invented	dynamite		
greco	thought	he	had	been	shot		
gelsen	walked	out	of	the	room	alone		
what	would	you	suggest		
two	murder	may	be	defined	as	an	act	of	violence	consisting	of	breaking	mangling	maltreating	or	otherwise	stopping	the	functions	of	a	living	organism	by	a	living	organism		
nope		
how	soon		
you	lousy	hunk	of	pigmeal	git	going		
the	surgeon	stood	by	helplessly	while	his	patient	died		
the	horse	balked	and	the	wagon	rattled	and	shook	as	he	edged	sideways		
he	had	been	driving	for	seven	straight	hours	and	his	eyes	were	starting	to	fog		
he	had	been	one	of	the	consulting	engineers	on	the	original	watchbird		
dinelli	was	so	intent	he	did	n't	see	the	watchbird	coming		
lightning	which	anticipated	your	moves	and	punished	your	intentions		
of	course	it	will	work		
i	do	n't	know		
you	have	to	have	those	macintyre	said	patiently	as	though	explaining	the	whole	thing	to	a	tenyearold		
i	still	feel	morally	responsible	because	i	manufacture	them		
start	again		
then	no	one	arrests	him		
take	my	word	captain		
that	's	ridiculous		
there	is	no	time		
parks	and	playgrounds	were	not	places	to	shun	after	dusk		
if	a	does	n't	work	try	b.		
the	breaking	mangling	or	otherwise	stopping	the	functions	of	a	living	organism	by	a	living	organism		
murder	must	be	stopped	too		
he	started	toward	the	door	then	turned	for	a	parting	shot		
i	do	n't	mean	that	gelsen	said		
well	i	figured	out	where	the	trouble	is	macintyre	said	gloomily	with	the	air	of	a	man	who	knows	just	how	he	blew	up	the	earthafter	it	was	too	late		
to	them	murder	was	murder		
and	when	they	reach	him	they	give	him	a	powerful	shock	or	something		
macintyre	was	n't	listening		
and	of	course	everything	else	is	a	living	organismrabbits	beetles	flies	wolves	mosquitoes	lions	crocodiles	crows	and	smaller	forms	of	life	such	as	bacteria		
gelsen	had	n't	realized	it	until	that	moment		
to	stop	murder	metal	and	electrons	reason	well	but	not	in	a	human	fashion		
greco	waited	patiently		
the	watchbirds	must	be	stopped	at	once		
the	captain	nodded		
i	suggest	you	control	yourself		
he	put	down	the	telephone		
i	mean	do	you	figure	there	might	be	some	danger	in	machine	thinking		
the	nurse	handed	the	surgeon	the	sponge		
famine		
we	'll	have	to	turn	them	off	then	one	by	one		
the	grocer	asked	staring	at	the	stunned	thief		
this	control	was	spasmodic	because	of	the	fewness	of	the	watchbirds		
and	then	something	happened		
with	his	free	hand	gelsen	mopped	perspiration	from	his	face		
rob	me		
you	should	n't	fear	them	either		
officer	celtrics	said		
but	the	watchbird	had	a	stronger	order	to	obeypreservation	of	life	including	its	own		
roger	greco	leaned	against	a	building	his	hands	in	his	pockets		
telephone	the	watchbird	company		
gelsen	felt	annoyed	at	macintyre	and	even	more	annoyed	at	himself	for	being	ridiculous		
a	correlation	center	tested	it	matching	it	with	electrical	and	chemical	data	in	its	memory	files		
wait	a	minute	gelsen	said		
simple	logic		
it	did	n't	excite	him	or	sicken	him		
say	a	year	barring	accidents		
what	in	hell		
then	he	telephoned	the	police		
in	a	corner	of	the	repair	room	lay	the	senior	control	engineer		
this	time	he	lay	on	the	ground	trying	to	draw	a	bead		
in	order	to	stop	all	of	them	the	watchbird	has	to	search	out	new	definitions	of	murder	and	correlate	them	with	what	it	already	knows		
i	'm	not	afraid	of	dying		
what	can	we	do		
too	busy	counting	my	fortune		
but	let	me	point	out	that	you	would	be	leaving	all	venus	without	a	postman		
kirk	had	it	in	89	ordered	up	big	and	special	just	for	him		
huh		
morrison	signed	off		
he	held	the	telephone	close	to	the	ground		
here	morrison	said	handing	the	robot	a	piece	of	goldenstone	worth	about	five	thousand	dollars	in	the	rough		
i	ca	n't	ask	max	for	help	morrison	decided		
he	picked	up	a	pebble		
on	the	sixth	day	he	sensed	movement	just	out	of	the	range	of	his	vision		
gripping	the	canteen	in	both	hands	morrison	watched	as	the	water	ported	four	thousand	miles	from	venusborg	appeared	as	a	slender	crystal	stream	above	the	mouth	of	his	canteen		
the	solution	foamed	green		
what		
morrison	asked		
morrison	stared	at	him	blankly	and	saw	beyond	him	the	waiting	wolfpack		
he	did	n't	sleep	but	he	could	n't	stay	awake	either		
the	robot	's	eyecells	became	distant	with	memory		
the	best	i	can	wish	you	is	a	speedy	and	painless	departure		
if	it	's	rich	enough	you	're	all	set		
something	must	be	wrong	with	their	diet		
take	a	look		
i	ca	n't		
thanks	for	remembering	janie		
the	sandwolves	were	outside	sniffing	and	snapping	their	jaws		
morrison	said		
they	drove	the	big	creature	upstairs	into	the	cloud	bank		
that	was	certain		
i	went	over	a	dune	and	blew	out	two	tires		
but	some	get	through	do	n't	they		
and	you	could	never	reach	it	without	the	resources	of	a	machine	shop		
are	you	sure		
that	is	a	criminal	offense		
reason	i	called	hey	eddie	said	what	happened	to	your	face		
unrepairable	said	eddie		
you	were	perfectly	right	morrison	said		
morrison	sat	down	and	shook	his	last	canteen		
venus	's	own	brand	of	wolf	small	lean	with	a	yellow	coat	and	long	grinning	jaws	it	was	one	of	the	few	mammals	that	made	its	home	in	the	scorpion	desert		
asked	williams	4	the	postman		
then	a	flock	of	small	flying	scorpions	sighted	the	waiting	kite		
of	course	morrison	said	feeling	his	smile	grow	stiff		
overhead	a	deltawinged	kite	found	him		
he	'll	probably	want	fifty	per	cent	of	the	claim		
and	get	jim	remstaater	out	of	trouble	too		
eddie	i	know	it	's	a	lot	to	ask	but	if	you	could	stake	me	to	a	couple	of	tires	i	ca	n't	do	it	eddie	said		
the	robot	climbed	out	of	the	vortex	and	looked	around		
whirling	around	he	saw	a	huge	old	wolf	in	full	charge		
i	can	and	must	williams	4	said	sadly		
he	examined	the	outcropping	again	and	found	a	hairline	fault	running	along	one	edge		
and	nothing	else	but	water	all	the	water	he	could	carry		
in	all	that	desert	there	was	n't	one	patch	of	green		
the	narrow	crevice	into	which	he	had	fallen	ran	straight	for	about	twenty	yards	then	curved	to	the	left		
and	fell	over	the	edge	of	a	little	cliff		
he	could	tell	he	was	in	a	badly	dehydrated	state		
it	still	looked	like	goldenstone		
max	could	barely	scrape	up	his	own	rent	much	less	take	care	of	stranded	prospectors		
no	it	's	just	the	high	cost	of	credit	on	venus	krandall	answered		
can	you	at	least	carry	a	letter	for	me		
i	do		
could	be	said	morrison		
it	may	well	be	williams	4	said		
you	have	an	emergency	telephone	have	n't	you		
sure	they	do	the	robot	said		
the	sandwolves	were	tracking	him	still	and	his	water	was	almost	gone		
morrison	realized	that	tomorrow	might	be	his	last	birthday	unless	he	found	goldenstone		
williams	4	said		
the	telephone	had	to	go	with	him	and	his	lightweight	testing	kit		
and	other	men	had	had	it	too	as	they	sat	on	their	precious	goldenstone	claims		
that	evening	he	found	a	shallow	cave	set	into	the	base	of	a	cliff		
no	false	alarms	no	visions	no	wild	hopes		
not	me	morrison	said		
they	would	indeed	said	the	robot		
grinning	he	said	i	do	n't	even	have	time	to	dry	off	before	i	have	to	go	out	again		
and	now	look		
the	robot	moved	its	head	quickly	dodging	the	blow		
he	fired	again	and	his	bullet	richocheted	off	the	cave	wall	stinging	him	with	stone	splinters		
frantically	morrison	tried	to	reach	the	operator		
he	sank	to	his	knees		
i	can	even	lend	you	pencil	and	paper		
this	sort	of	thing	happens	to	prospectors	every	day		
he	loosened	the	revolver	in	its	holster		
yes	of	course	morrison	said	wearily		
the	chief	shook	his	body	sadly		
ger	flowed	gaily	to	his	feet		
one	of	the	men	walked	past	and	touched	the	dog	on	the	head		
he	sniffed	the	air	noting	that	the	smells	the	mannostrils	picked	up	were	n't	unpleasant	at	all		
he	knew	that	the	twentyfirst	grom	expedition	to	this	planet	was	near	the	point	of	complete	failure		
this	particular	world	discovered	in	a	scouting	expedition	was	needed		
not	quite	quickly	enough		
the	ship	dropped	silently	toward	the	surface	of	the	enemy	planet		
at	the	edge	of	the	woods	ger	turned	himself	into	a	facsimile	of	a	dog		
also	the	sounds	were	n't	half	so	devastating		
now	shipless	he	was	naked	in	an	alien	world		
dusk	crept	across	the	face	of	the	planet	as	pid	maneuvered	near	the	atomic	power	installation		
a	tiny	fourlegged	creature	darted	in	front	of	them		
they	waited		
the	bush	rustled	above	him		
the	unit	went	to	work		
ger	overtook	the	animal	and	knocked	it	down		
pid	did	indeed		
ger	walked	past	the	man	ignoring	him		
that	dog	i	was	hunting	with	is	a	grom	from	the	twelfth	expedition		
and	being	born	shapeless	all	grom	should	have	freedom	of	shape	ger	said		
nothing	happened		
the	man	started	to	walk	over		
the	other	expeditions	are	right	here		
inside	the	ship	a	littleused	circuit	closed		
oh	no	ilg	assured	him		
the	men	were	of	fixed	and	immutable	form	like	stones	or	trees		
pid	shook	his	entire	body	in	annoyance		
he	stiffened	his	wings	and	glided	regretfully	putting	aside	his	desires	to	experiment	with	this	wonderful	shape	at	least	for	the	present		
the	others	had	failed	in	their	duty	because	they	were	of	the	lower	castes	weak	and	irresponsible		
he	was	once	fined	for	assuming	a	quasihunter	shape		
ages	ago	the	grom	had	spent	their	store	of	radioactives	in	spreading	throughout	their	neighboring	worlds	occupying	the	ones	that	they	could	live	on		
only	relatively	close	sounds	stood	out		
he	curled	his	lips	and	held	his	breath		
he	rose	in	a	matter	of	a	few	sparrow	heartbeats	to	an	altitude	of	a	hundred	feet		
pid	was	speechless		
ger	nodded	and	melted	back	into	the	underbrush		
that	pid	thought	was	it		
the	first	job	pid	thought	was	to	get	past	that	gate		
he	must	be	around	here	somewhere		
he	would	have	to	watch	him	more	closely		
after	all	the	grom	were	strong	on	ingenuity		
pid	let	it	go	at	that		
help	me	look	for	him	pid	said	to	ger		
interesting	said	the	tree		
but	it	was	too	far	away		
at	the	extreme	edge	of	the	woods	they	could	observe	the	atomic	energy	installation		
there	's	a	shape	to	suit	every	need		
i	'll	have	to	try	that	shape	some	time		
it	's	only	natural	as	well	as	lawful		
and	then	there	was	nothing	at	all		
the	pilot	altered	course		
they	watched		
why	were	you	so	long		
no	ger	said		
they	decided	that	ger	would	sally	out	in	the	morning	as	a	dog		
if	something	went	wrong	pid	could	change	his	shape	to	meet	the	occasion		
i	was	hungry	he	said		
what		
he	called		
pid	heaved	a	sigh	of	relief	and	sat	down		
this	unrest	is	caused	purely	by	crowding		
as	he	watched	another	dog	came	running	toward	ger		
now	get	some	sleep	pid	said		
at	the	gate	the	guard	called	to	him		
certainly	the	men	must	have	learned	something	from	the	expeditions	they	had	captured	in	the	past		
there	he	reshaped	obliterating	the	offending	dog	ears	and	nostrils	with	vicious	strokes	of	his	thoughts		
back	toward	the	bush	at	a	fine	clip	again	up	and	over		
i	know		
the	dogshape	was	out		
evidently	dogs	could	wander	pretty	much	where	they	wished		
the	men	will	kill	you	off	he	said		
the	dog	approached	and	sniffed		
without	looking	he	hurried	past		
not	here	it	is	n't	ger	said	still	wagging	his	tail		
was	ger	mumbled	writhing	with	embarrassment		
he	had	spent	his	entire	childhood	around	ships	his	entire	manhood	flying	them		
traitor	hissed	pid	growing	a	mouth	in	his	chest	to	hiss	it	and	then	he	did	something	that	caused	ilg	to	exclaim	in	outrage		
only	luck	had	kept	him	from	being	seen	during	the	sensory	onslaught		
again	he	studied	the	gate	the	men	standing	beside	it	the	building	beyond	in	which	was	the	allimportant	reactor		
he	started	to	flow	into	the	shape	of	a	dog		
but	another	moment	of	such	impressions	would	have	driven	pid	the	pilot	mad		
sounds	upon	soundsmore	noise	than	he	had	ever	heard	before	at	one	time	in	his	life
