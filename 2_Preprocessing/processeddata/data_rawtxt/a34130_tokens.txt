it	had	been	detected	at	the	halfway	point	of	its	trip		
grg	and	yrl	gasped	as	one	of	the	god	's	doubletentacles	buckled	crumpled	with	a	glinting	of	shinyhard	material		
they	shrank	back	fearful	that	the	display	might	be	a	disapproving	communicationyet	they	held	their	ground	knowing	they	had	lived	good	lives	and	deserved	no	condemnation	on	any	score	they	could	imagine		
as	it	flew	it	reflected	starlightand	the	red	glow	of	the	universal	eye	behind	itfrom	its	sleek	surfaces		
it	paused	then	dropped	to	the	surface	of	phobos	where	it	began	to	crawl	about		
yrl	moved	to	intercept	it		
the	huge	plllnk	even	now	creeping	aroundwrinkleskinned	and	detestable	its	coloration	the	same	as	the	god	's	the	most	loathsome	sight	imaginable	a	godplllnk		
it	was	onefifth	the	size	of	the	god	's	body		
it	was	silent		
the	last	few	moments	of	the	god	's	descent	were	quite	rapid		
their	thinking	trunks	tingled	with	misery	sorrow	bitter	anger	and	disappointment		
how	smoothly	it	flew		
had	it	come	to	punish	them	for	not	being	good	enough	for	overreproducing	for	worshipping	improperly		
the	god	began	to	land		
killed	by	the	giant	plllnka	scourge	from	which	evidently	even	the	gods	were	not	spared		
a	very	long	time	passed		
it	was	ready	to	address	them		
soon	it	would	be	as	good	as	new	for	otherwise	agony	would	forbid	conversation		
it	silently	circled	phobos	and	then	returned	to	the	eye		
it	shot	red	flame	downward	from	its	mouth	on	the	underside	of	its	gleaming	body		
but	there	could	be	no	doubt	regarding	its	origin	its	nature	its	destination	for	in	the	matter	of	form	the	god	was	a	close	replica	of	grg	and	yrlof	all	the	creatures	of	their	race		
the	god	remained	motionless	though	in	conversationposition	and	silent		
the	plllnk	stopped	having	sensed	them		
from	a	selfish	standpoint	it	might	even	tell	them	how	to	get	rid	of	the	plllnka	subject	of	constant	prayer		
how	wonderful	it	would	be	also	if	the	god	could	tell	them	how	to	get	rid	of	the	itching	crawling	parasitic	plllnk	whose	bite	in	sufficient	numbers	was	often	fatal		
this	was	the	greatest	moment	of	grg	's	and	yrl	's	lives		
its	body	thudded	silently	stirring	pumice	dust		
2		
caught	by	horror	and	fearing	the	worst	grg	and	yrl	waited	for	the	god	to	speak		
the	only	significant	difference	was	that	the	god	gleamed	mysteriously	as	if	its	angular	hardline	representation	of	normal	form	were	cast	in	shining	stone		
a	long	time	passed		
the	two	doubletentacles	remained	outstretched	howeverand	they	pointed	at	the	shadows	where	grg	and	yrl	waited	and	watched		
while	grg	touched	tentacles	with	the	dead	god	in	reverent	mourning	in	terrible	sorrow	in	loss	in	supplication	yrl	shredded	the	godplllnk		
then	it	darted	for	the	hole	it	had	eaten	in	the	god		
the	effort	was	not	successful		
it	did	not	land		
then	grg	twitched	as	a	plllnk	bit	him	just	under	the	front	left	doubletentacle		
damn	john	cotter	was	thinking		
the	god	unable	to	remain	erect	with	its	injury	slowly	toppled		
the	impact	was	hard		
now		
how	wonderful	it	would	be	to	fly	said	yrl		
it	grew	largerlargerand	then	it	stopped	growing	larger		
it	braced	two	sets	of	tentacles	against	the	ground	as	if	trying	to	push	itself	erect		
two	days	later	a	second	god	was	detected		
it	bore	considerable	resemblance	to	a	plllnk	except	for	its	shinywrinkled	grey	skin	plllnks	were	purple		
the	god	lowered	on	its	belching	tongue	of	flamethe	flame	that	seemed	a	tiny	part	a	sliver	of	the	universal	eye	that	watched		
something	appeared	at	the	hole		
what	would	the	god	tell	them		
it	was	octopidal	with	sinewy	double	tentacles	and	a	thinking	trunk	and	a	reproduction	pouch		
then	a	tiny	hole	appeared	in	the	god	's	side		
dying		
the	flames	stopped		
simultaneously	the	darting	red	flames	seemed	to	lessen	in	intensity	and	length		
the	god	stirred		
perhaps	said	grg	we	have	been	found	ready	to	be	taught		
it	must	have	healed	its	broken	tentacletruly	a	god		
within	the	day	it	was	back	in	the	company	of	eleven	other	gods		
it	silently	circled	phobos	from	the	universal	eye		
grg	and	yrl	blinked	their	own	dullsurfaced	astronomically	farsighted	rustred	eyes	at	each	other	in	supreme	excitement	and	anticipation		
mars	was	as	grg	and	yrl	had	learned	from	their	elders	and	now	taught	their	youngers	the	stern	seeingall	eye	of	it	who	was	the	universe		
and	this	thing	was	hugehuge		
again	it	was	motionless		
dead		
that	was	a	neat	bit	of	sloppiness	that	landing	carruthers	will	chew	me	out	and	in	again	pause	holy	cats	i	hope	the	radio	is	n't	busted	or	i	'll	have	a	helluva	wait	before	they	follow	up	and	find	me	       	the	god	was	dead		
for	a	broken	tentacle	meant	that	fluids	would	seep	out	and	soon	the	drydeath	would	occur		
the	god	had	assumed	conversationposition		
would	it	tell	them	the	place	and	destiny	of	their	lowly	race		
it	was	motionless		
with	a	great	bound	impelled	by	outrage	yrl	was	upon	it		
strange	marks	were	on	the	side	of	the	god	's	body		
was	the	god	fatally	injured		
from	that	great	eye	a	day	ago	had	sprung	a	shining	messenger	an	emissary	a	god	that	must	be	coming	on	a	purposeful	visit		
would	it	divulge	the	cosmic	secret		
they	were	1st	mars	expeditionu	s.	space	forceplanettosatellite	crewboat	no		
grg	and	yrl	moved	into	view	from	the	shadows	of	the	crater	wall		
while	grg	and	yrl	and	their	people	could	bound	about	with	a	great	agility	in	phobos	light	gravity	they	could	not	fly		
they	waited	for	the	god	to	speak		
the	plllnk	changed	course	and	headed	swiftly	up	a	sand	dune		
what	would	it	reveal		
grg	and	yrl	stared	at	each	other		
red	flickers	and	sharpedged	black	shadows	danced	about	the	two	who	waited	below		
he	combed	the	light	fur	there	found	the	plllnk	and	shredded	it	casting	the	pieces	roundabout	so	that	no	two	of	them	might	combine	to	form	another	plllnk		
less	even		
who	knows		
it	's	a	rotten	way	to	run	a	world	killing	to	decide	who	's	right	or	wrong	specially	killing	people	who	got	damn	little	say	about	it		
he	yelled	they	biting		
think	keith'll	be	back	from	the	war	today	ben		
there	's	noplace	they	'd	want	to	get	to	and	it	's	sure	no	country	for	fighting		
they	musta	found	bulletholes	though	tom	pace	said		
the	socket	's	loose		
i	might	as	well	fish	anyway	take	in	some	fun		
his	lips	thinned		
then	he	got	the	blanket	from	the	couch	and	hung	it	down	double	over	the	rod	and	fitted	the	buttonholes	sewn	all	along	its	edge	over	the	nails	driven	around	the	window	casing	and	patted	it	here	and	there	until	not	a	speck	of	light	would	escape	when	the	lamps	were	lit		
heck	it	did	n't	sound	too	bad		
some	people	got	reasons	to	let	it	happen	and	some	ai	n't	got	the	sense	not	to		
you	just	ask	anybody	who	was	there	it	us	just	after	i	shot	it	started	tom	pace	thumped	the	table		
ai	n't	seen	no	planes	for	couple	years	now		
no	way	for	a	man	to	live	to	have	dead	legs	and	dying	arms		
he	worked	the	cigar	over	to	the	corner	of	his	mouth	and	settled	it	in	the	nest	of	stained	whiskers	there		
way	off	to	his	left	across	a	long	flat	of	sunflowers	and	goldenrod	he	saw	windy	harris	down	on	the	creekbank	by	the	bridge		
he	looked	down	at	the	glowering	pair	and	said	well	come	the	next	plane	if	there	is	one	we	'll	shove	a	rifle	in	your	hand	jim	and	see	how	good	your	eye	is		
we	made	our	families	and	watched	'em	fit	into	the	town	and	the	valley	like	the	valley	fits	into	the	world	and	we	watched	'em	go	on	doing	what	we	done	before	them	building	and	working	and	planting	and	raising	familiesgoing	on	like	people	got	to	go	on		
it	ai	n't	important	who	done	it	we	oughta	just	be	grateful	we	got	it		
i	fought	in	one		
but	if	you	come	down	low	we	'll	try	to	get	you	you	crazy	murderers		
you	'll	maybe	get	home	after	anna	and	me	want	to	light	the	lamps	and	we	ca	n't	do	it	till	it	's	fixed		
we	ca	n't	make	it	again		
then	we	wo	n't	have	any	music		
why	i	could	outpitch	and	outchop	and	outshoot	any	of	you	whippersnappers	until	they	old	jim	walloped	the	chair	arm		
looking	toward	town	he	saw	that	tom	pace	had	been	on	his	way	home	and	the	sound	had	caught	him	between	trees		
what	we	want	is	going	to	last	usand	what	we	do	n't	want	will	come	too	late	to	hurt	us		
i	just	bet		
i	was	there	you	old	now	now	jim	do	n't	spit	for	godsake		
it	was	a	good	gun	a	straightshooter	one	of	the	bestwhich	was	why	it	was	here	instead	of	at	his	house		
why	you	whippersnapper	jim	growled	you	just	go	ahead	and	run	'em		
ben	she	said	when	he	sat	down	again	i	wish	you	'd	take	a	look	at	the	phonograph	too		
you	're	gon	na	get	a	sore	eye	i	sweartobacco	in	it		
takes	a	plane	a	while	to	know	it	's	hurt	do	n't	it		
you	can	tell	the	fish	about	who	got	the	plane		
we	just	might		
from	outside	came	the	late	morning	sounds	the	murmuring	of	smoky	creek	at	the	edge	of	town	under	its	cool	tunnel	of	willows	the	twittering	of	a	flock	of	robins	circling	above	the	constant	soft	rustle	of	the	trees	that	crowded	the	green	hills	around		
tom	dealt	out	two	cards	and	said	war		
i	see		
even	one	right	after	this	one	ten	years	or	so	if	this	one	's	over		
what	can	a	man	lose	more'n	his	life		
a	funny	kind	of	peace		
something	to	walk	under		
for	planes		
i	'd	shout	and	yell	and	pray	i	'd	pray	almighty	god	for	you	to	get	it		
he	put	his	thin	back	against	the	cushions	and	pushed	at	the	edge	of	the	table	with	his	hands		
it	mighta	been	joey	they	looked	alike		
reminded	him	of	all	old	jim	had	said	and	he	shook	his	head		
about	who	's	fighting	who	over	what		
he	stopped	by	the	door	of	the	town	hall	to	listen	carefully	his	sharp	old	eyes	halfshut		
it	was	rationed	to	two	cups	a	day	he	always	took	his	with	his	lunch	and	sometimes	he	'd	have	sold	a	leg	to	dive	into	a	full	pot		
on	the	way	in	ben	had	noticed	that	the	woodbox	was	about	emptyhe'd	have	to	bring	home	another	bag	of	charcoal	from	the	general	store"which	was	windy	's	barn	all	braced	up		
smoky	creek	looks	dead	as	sodom		
two	ai	n't	enough	old	jim	said	bitterly		
we	're	ready	as	we	can	be	if	another	plane	comes	around		
well	we	were	talking	about	that	this	morning	down	at	the	hall	suse		
well	windy	said	i	hope	we	keep	on	getting	emthem	as	sees	us	anyway		
jim	snorted		
about	how	the	international	mess	is	getting	worse	again	and	we	better	make	more	bombs	for	the	next	one		
benabout	the	phonograph	suse	he	turned	his	head	to	look	at	her	eyes		
it	came	down	low	over	main	street	while	the	thunders	of	its	first	pass	still	echoed	and	rolled		
the	only	time	anybody	in	town	ever	lit	a	lamp	was	on	social	night	then	the	old	people	stayed	up	till	around	midnight	for	eats	and	entertainment	otherwise	everybody	got	to	bed	at	eight	or	so	and	climbed	out	with	the	dawn		
his	house	was	in	pretty	good	shape		
jim	closed	his	eyes	and	his	face	looked	like	a	skull		
the	porch	had	been	down	too	right	after	the	bombingbut	the	old	men	working	at	night	had	raised	it	and	braced	it	up		
we	got	enough	gardens	and	livestock	and	all	the	canned	stuff	in	the	store	to	last	us	for	a	for	as	long	as	we	got		
other	than	that	it	ai	n't	our	concern		
i	think	they	will	real	soon		
i	can	spit	to	where	you	sit	and	i	can	spit	faster'n	you	can	move	i	bet	unless	you	're	faster'n	a	fly	and	you	ai	n't		
the	blood	from	eyes	nose	ears	mouthhis	blood	it	was	part	of	it		
we	shoot	and	maybe	it	shoots	too	and	we	pray		
ben		
ben	bates	looked	at	one	of	the	two	cards	tom	pace	had	dealthis	hole	card		
he	shook	his	head	wonderingly		
maybe	they	did	ben	said		
but	i	got	it	all	right		
here	it	's	peaceful		
she	started	to	put	down	her	knitting	and	get	up	and	he	said	just	asking	and	pressed	her	shoulder	till	she	sat	again		
you	keep	talking	so	high	and	mighty	tom	said	we	'll	carry	you	out	o	here	and	take	you	and	dump	you	in	the	creek		
might	even	find	rifle	bullets		
it	's	a	world	for	old	people		
i	set	him	down	and	he	fell	to	studying	her	intently		
she	asked	again		
two	years	ago	on	the	bleak	surface	of	eros	yurt	had	asked	engstrom	to	do	the	same	thing		
if	the	human	body	is	a	furnace	then	the	zen	body	is	a	feeder	pile		
she	was	exhibiting	every	ounce	of	emotion	a	zen	is	capable	of	which	is	a	lot	and	i	could	recognize	it	but	not	in	any	familiar	terms		
i	found	out	later	from	yurt	that	biology	for	the	reasons	which	follow	was	one	of	the	most	difficult	studies	so	difficult	that	nuclear	physics	actually	preceded	it		
but	the	zen	's	question	even	my	rationalization	of	my	reaction	to	it	had	given	me	a	chill		
we	all	had	a	drink	to	the	saving	of	a	great	race	that	might	have	become	extinct		
give	us	some	time	to	get	acquainted	will	you	dave		
do	you	see		
she	said	i	can	see	enough	of	my	own	body	toandyes	yurt	i	said	here	's	the	female	we	thought	we	might	find		
and	you	survived		
we	could	do	without	him	even	though	he	had	been	a	big	help		
i	thought	i	knew	why		
it	was	the	likeliest	place	to	look	for	fossils		
my	torch	beam	flickered	across	a	small	redfurred	teddybear	shape		
finally	it	nodded	and	i	thought	as	i	had	often	before	how	curious	it	was	that	this	gesture	should	be	common	to	earthmen	and	zen		
you	get	that	way	particularly	after	several	weeks	of	living	in	steel	and	it	was	lucky	that	i	got	that	way	this	time	or	i	might	have	missed	the	zen		
take	over		
what	i	had	already	said	to	it	were	stock	phrases	that	yurt	had	taught	me	i	knew	still	more	but	i	could	n't	speak	zennacai	fluently	by	any	means		
she	had	been	alone	for	three	thousand	years	on	a	chip	of	bone	from	her	dead	world	beneath	a	sepulchre	of	stars		
mn		
i	realized	that	here	was	only	a	sick	girl	no	tiny	monster		
five	hundred	years	eertmnnot	too	long		
then	i	said	yes	realizing	that	the	nod	was	n't	visible	through	the	oneway	glass	of	my	helmet		
from	the	coloring	i	knew	this	zen	was	a	female		
thiswhat	we	are	onwas	part	of	sorn	i	know		
maybe	that	i	thought	was	what	evolution	always	worked	toward		
i	ca	n't	even	hurt	myself		
why	do	i	want	you	to	kill	me		
it	came	a	little	closer	actually	and	peered	up	at	my	helmeted	mirrorglassed	headunmistakably	the	seat	of	intelligence	it	appears	of	any	race	anywhere		
it	took	me	a	couple	of	seconds	to	untangle	the	squeaking	syllables	and	get	any	sense	out	of	them		
its	mouth	almost	humanshaped	worked	finally	words	came		
i	am	not	a	zen	i	told	her	giving	my	torch	full	brilliance	for	the	crew	's	sake	but	yurt	here	is		
i	told	her	that	the	zen	had	been	all	evidence	indicated	the	toughest	hardest	longestlived	creatures	god	had	ever	cooked	up	practically	independent	of	their	environment	no	special	ecological	niche	just	raw	stubborn	tenacious	life	developed	to	a	fantastic	extremea	greater	force	of	life	than	any	other	known	one	that	could	exist	almost	anywhere	under	practically	any	conditionseven	floating	in	midspace	which	asteroid	or	no	this	zen	was	doing	right	now		
the	zen	said		
i	addressed	it	in	its	own	language	clucking	my	tongue	and	whistling	through	my	teeth	suh	zen	in	the	bluewhite	light	of	the	torch	the	zen	shivered		
but	i	rememberi	remember	things	different	from	this		
nothing	at	all	strange	about	remembering	when	you	are	twentyfive	the	things	that	happened	to	you	when	you	were	seven		
yurt	is		
i	moved	my	torch	off	them	and	headed	back	for	the	lucky	pierre		
to	save	space	the	following	dialogue	is	reproduced	without	bumblings	blank	stares	and	whatdidyousays		
from	another	world		
i	'd	been	expecting	that		
i	was	nearing	the	bottom	of	the	chunk	the	part	that	had	been	the	deepest	beneath	sorn	's	surface	before	the	blowup		
but	what	good	is	itlifewhen	there	are	no	other	zen		
i	said	yurt	are	you	sure	you	want	us	to	keep	hands	off	just	go	off	and	leave	you		
from	out	there		
and	now	this	old	old	creature	remembering	back	three	thousand	years	to	childhoodprobably	to	those	elementary	schools"remembering	and	defining	the	differences	in	environment	between	then	and	now	and	more	wondering	at	its	existence	in	the	different	now	and	then	i	got	my	own	thinking	straightened	out		
but	i	found	it		
keep	this	in	mind	by	the	way	i	barely	knew	the	language	and	the	zen	could	barely	remember	it		
and	there	had	been	no	special	stress	given	the	distinction	just	clear	precise	thinking	like	yurt	's		
i	wanted	to	hang	around	but	i	knew	how	i	'd	feel	if	a	zen	say	would	n't	go	away	if	i	were	the	last	man	alive	and	had	just	met	the	last	woman		
i	added	still	a	little	awed	we	know	how	long	ago	your	world	died		
i	'm	not	a	zen		
it	did	n't	say	anything		
how	do	i	live	here		
i	said	i	wo	n't	hurt	you	again	speaking	in	its	own	language		
she	whispered	worriedly		
yurt	's	eyes	were	fastened	on	the	girl		
i	was	child	she	said	again	after	a	moment		
but	i	ca	n't		
the	light	passed	on		
he	moved	closer	to	her	not	even	looking	back	to	talk	to	me		
my	hair	did	not	stand	on	end	regardless	of	what	you	've	heard	me	quoted	as	saying		
i	have	been	here	forfor	she	hesitated"i	do	n't	know		
i	was	child	then	she	said	i	do	n't	knowwhat	happened		
three	thousand	years	of	darkness	and	silence		
for	five	hundred	of	my	years		
but	i	asked	why		
yes	please		
please	will	you	kill	me		
here	was	no	cuddly	teddy	bear		
i	took	him	back	to	where	the	female	waited		
the	zen	moved	away	from	the	rock	but	not	away	from	me		
i	've	tried	so	often	to	do	it	myself	the	zen	said	softly		
what	if	they	do	n't	like	each	other		
she	looked	up	at	my	steelandglass	face	i	must	have	seemed	like	a	giant		
in	reality	our	talk	lasted	over	an	hour		
she	turned	to	him		
whatdo	i	do	now		
eert		
it	had	n't	spoken	except	to	itself	for	three	thousand	years
