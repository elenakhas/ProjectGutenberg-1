f.	langbridge	i	have	called	to	see	the	furniture	you	have	advertised	he	said	this	is	sunday	you	say		
superstitious	louis	shuddered	when	he	saw	this	dog	mamma	what	are	you	laughing	at?.she	was	giving	herself	to	the	enemy		
when	the	francoprussian	war	broke	out	and	for	months	before	the	turenne	was	the	rendezvous	for	those	of	the	villagers	who	had	any	desire	to	discuss	the	situation	i	can	not	leave	him	you	must	leave	him	i’ll	meet	you	at	that	vacant	field	next	the	church	at	eleven	and	the	money	will	be	there	the	listener	in	the	next	compartment	withdrew	hastily	and	mingled	with	the	crowd	at	the	bar		
by	the	next	he	saw	the	head	from	which	it	had	rolled	pillowed	on	his	bunk	he	could	no	longer	cry	a	berlin	the	french	army	was	facing	paris	with	berlin	at	its	back	a	few	days	after	this	pierre	returned		
i	’m	sorry	my	call	is	inopportune	i	will	come	again	he	left	his	card	on	the	table	perhaps	it	was	the	soft	tremor	that	was	imparted	to	his	fleshy	leg	from	the	gnawing	of	the	wooden	one	but	louis	never	slept	more	soundly	than	when	this	was	progressing	he	sauntered	down	the	street	in	his	shirt	sleeves	with	his	fingers	in	his	vest	pockets		
the	calash	was	farther	back	in	the	yard	than	usual	to	drive	out	he	would	have	to	pass	diana	’s	window	potvin	took	the	weight	lightly	and	threw	it	over	his	shoulder	maurice	maurice	i	’m	sick	of	life		
pushing	open	the	door	he	saw	his	brother	striding	up	and	down	the	room	with	his	hands	clasped	behind	him	and	his	head	bent	muttering	to	himself	in	a	moment	the	bird	rushed	out	and	flew	madly	off	he	was	evidently	dressed	with	great	care	in	a	completely	new	outfit		
there	uncle	garnaud	i	know	he	must	mean	something	by	that	everything	everything	murmured	eloise	there	was	a	sudden	stir	in	the	room		
he	’s	gone	she	said	jack	’s	gone	louis	halfafraid	of	him	gave	him	a	name	he	called	him	fidele	the	only	thing	he	discerned	distinctly	was	a	white	sort	of	cap		
at	last	he	said	carelessly	how	much	touching	the	purses	it	was	only	the	number	of	the	stove	but	it	was	also	the	number	of	his	ticket	i	must	protect	you		
alexis	glancing	over	his	shoulder	gave	a	hoarse	shout	to	relieve	his	excitement	he	had	seen	the	head	of	the	chaste	diana	then	she	went	home	charles	kept	on	his	wonted	way	if	they	talked	in	the	parlor	they	could	hear	him	stirring	upstairs	if	they	strolled	in	the	road	they	could	see	his	light	in	the	window		
her	mother	always	went	away	early	in	the	morning	and	came	back	before	noon	and	one	day	she	caught	josephine	sewing	fidele	lay	by	his	side	yet	of	that	estate	this	old	house	with	its	surrounding	three	acres	of	land	was	all	that	remained	and	of	the	retainers	that	once	held	allegiance	to	this	proud	name	louis	bois	was	the	last		
the	tapping	woke	her	she	rose	on	her	elbow	the	sound	came	again	she	went	to	the	window	and	raised	a	corner	of	the	curtain	she	expects	some	morning	to	look	across	and	see	the	little	milliner	cast	down	crumbs	for	the	birds	cuerrier	pursed	up	his	lips	and	whistled	the	only	tune	he	knew	one	from	la	fille	de	madame	angot	he	was	uneasy	too	uneasy	to	follow	the	intricacies	of	his	tune	and	he	stopped	whistling		
you	are	very	good	monsieur	not	at	all	my	father	picks	up	these	things	for	the	house	when	they	are	really	valuable	these	are	very	valuable	she	still	wore	an	air	of	shyness	and	looked	abstractedly	from	the	window	into	a	lilacbush	she	seemed	nervous	and	apprehensive	then	he	shook	off	the	dust	of	viger	but	not	before	swearing	louis	bois	who	was	old	enough	to	be	his	father	and	loved	him	as	such	to	stay	and	watch	the	forlorn	hope	of	the	rioux	estate	until	he	the	last	of	the	line	should	return	and	redeem	his	ancient	heritage	victor	also	wonders	what	he	will	say		
then	taking	the	empty	cage	they	went	back	to	the	cabin	hans	opened	it	and	said	something	in	german	when	he	saw	who	it	was	in	truth	if	the	shopkeeping	had	been	a	failure	was	it	the	fault	of	josephine	or	madame	labrosse		
it	was	built	of	massive	timbers	i	will	get	it	for	you	and	by	and	by	away	goes	madame	labrosse	just	for	a	moment	she	says		
he	tossed	a	sleepless	night	and	then	resolved	desperately	pierre	was	not	slow	in	coming	again	but	instead	of	seeing	eloise	he	had	a	note	thrust	into	his	hand	by	the	little	servingmaid	their	savor	only	went	up	and	rested	in	beads	on	the	pane	making	a	veil	behind	which	they	could	stiffen	and	grow	cold	in	protest	against	an	unappreciative	public		
it	was	the	sunniest	corner	in	viger	where	old	garnaud	had	built	his	cabin	his	cabin	for	it	could	not	be	called	a	house	he	met	philippe	in	the	hall	but	the	second	week	in	january	brought	a	letter	two	days	old	from	new	york		
the	walls	of	the	kitchen	story	were	rough	stone	while	the	upper	part	had	been	plastered	and	overlaid	with	a	buffcolored	wash	but	time	had	cracked	off	the	plaster	in	many	places	and	showed	the	solid	stones	he	put	on	a	new	peucevelvet	coat	which	had	just	come	home	from	the	tailor	’s	and	started	for	viger	eloise	began	to	walk	up	and	down	the	room	restlessly		
a	cloud	above	had	taken	the	starlight	and	in	the	willows	a	little	rain	fell	with	a	timorous	sound	in	a	moment	josephine	is	in	victor	’s	arms	her	cheek	is	against	the	velvet	coat	as	he	took	in	the	money	and	made	change	he	uttered	the	word	good	continually	good	good	there	was	something	exciting	in	the	way	he	pronounced	that	word	something	that	goaded	the	hearers	into	extravagance		
when	pierre	next	came	it	was	raining	quietly	through	a	silver	haze	the	little	maid	opened	the	door	a	moment	later	eloise	came	into	the	room	he	had	drawn	a	blank	the	widow	watched	her	go	in		
at	last	it	came	to	be	reality	for	him	and	then	he	could	not	sit	quietly	and	watch	the	lovers	he	would	let	his	pipe	go	out	and	stride	impatiently	up	and	down	the	veranda	my	father	wanted	me	to	come	out	and	look	at	the	things	you	advertised	he	said	alexis	looked	uneasy		
in	one	day	thousands	of	violets	had	lit	their	little	tips	of	yellow	fire	in	the	tangle	of	the	underwood	in	one	day	the	tulips	were	moulded	into	fragile	cups	of	flame	burning	steady	in	the	sunlight	in	one	day	the	lilacs	had	burst	their	little	clovelike	blooms	and	were	crowding	in	the	darkgreen	leaves	josephine	said	madame	labrosse	quietly	through	her	tears	josephine	we	must	set	up	a	little	shop	said	josephine	with	a	movement	of	despair	every	one	sets	up	a	little	shop	true	and	what	every	one	does	we	must	do	but	not	every	one	succeeds	and	ours	would	be	a	very	little	shop	there	are	some	other	things	we	could	do	mamma	said	josephine	do	not	dare!.the	days	were	clear	as	glass	already	the	maples	were	stroked	with	fire	with	the	lustre	of	wine	and	gold	early	risers	felt	the	keener	air	the	sunsets	reddened	the	mists	which	lay	light	as	lawn	on	the	low	fields		
the	dog	’s	body	broke	the	old	sash	and	crashed	through	the	glass	they	parted	when	they	saw	him	coming	and	he	stood	peering	down	at	the	map	through	his	glasses	there	is	a	vinous	lustre	in	his	eyes		
just	the	money	myself	i	is	it	not	mine	some	one	in	the	next	compartment	rose	and	put	his	ear	to	the	partition	one	night	on	the	eve	of	his	expectation	louis	fell	asleep	as	he	was	cooking	his	supper	he	was	in	a	perfect	fury	of	rage	and	went	off	to	bed	cursing	like	a	seapirate		
it	only	had	one	blossom	all	the	time	it	was	alive	and	it	is	dead	now	and	looks	like	a	dry	stick	no	more	money	was	coming	in	and	louis	had	the	perpetual	sight	of	the	alienated	lands	before	his	eyes	i	know	i	’ll	do	something	desperate	she	said		
he	had	won	the	seventyfivethousanddollar	prize	everything	is	on	three	legs	68	rue	alfred	de	musset		
suddenly	he	gives	a	few	sharp	cries	as	if	to	try	his	voice	the	widow	shook	her	finger	at	her	image	in	the	glass	took	on	all	the	colors	of	the	rainbow	and	dusted	off	a	guitar	of	her	youth	in	the	autumn	he	comes	sadly	up	out	of	the	valley	leading	his	horse	the	rein	through	his	arm	and	his	hands	in	his	coatsleeves
