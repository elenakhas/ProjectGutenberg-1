and	even	if	we	look	only	at	more	palpable	difficulties	the	problem	to	be	solved	by	our	civil	war	was	so	vast	both	in	its	immediate	relations	and	its	future	consequences	the	conditions	of	its	solution	were	so	intricate	and	so	greatly	dependent	on	incalculable	and	uncontrollable	contingencies	so	many	of	the	data	whether	for	hope	or	fear	were	from	their	novelty	incapable	of	arrangement	under	any	of	the	categories	of	historical	precedent	that	there	were	moments	of	crisis	when	the	firmest	believer	in	the	strength	and	sufficiency	of	the	democratic	theory	of	government	might	well	hold	his	breath	in	vague	apprehension	of	disaster	but	it	is	on	the	understanding	and	not	on	the	sentiment	of	a	nation	that	all	safe	legislation	must	be	based	but	no	case	could	well	be	less	in	point	for	besides	that	he	was	a	man	of	such	fairmindedness	as	is	always	the	raw	material	of	wisdom	he	had	in	his	profession	a	training	precisely	the	opposite	of	that	to	which	a	partisan	is	subjected
