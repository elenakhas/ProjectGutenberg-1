she	was	silent	again	he	passed	down	the	narrow	little	passage	which	she	called	a	hall	of	the	seven	and	sixpenny	house	which	was	his	first	home	no	she	cried		
there	was	a	selfconscious	strain	in	his	blue	eyes	and	a	pallor	about	his	mouth	where	the	young	fair	moustache	glistened	i	came	out	to	listen	to	it	a	very	large	tipsy	man	with	his	cap	over	his	eyes	was	calling		
for	a	little	way	i	carried	her	into	the	trees	i'll	do	my	best	for	him	he	grinned	to	himself	in	a	very	bad	temper	that	was	all		
what	am	i	frightened	of	him	for?.you	will	miss	him	said	mr	lindley	that	is	certain	and	he	wanted	still	more	intensely	to	go	right	away	to	canada		
i	saw	it	was	black	and	rough	inside	his	breast	was	a	pain	like	a	wound	she	went	cold	as	she	sat	and	impervious	almost	as	if	she	had	become	stone		
then	she	laughed	after	a	while	she	calmed	herself	rose	and	sponged	her	face	did	you	find	it	dead	he	asked		
and	all	the	while	she	had	the	insupportable	feeling	of	being	out	of	the	order	selfresponsible	bewildered	what	i	am	i	am	and	let	it	be	enough	he	thought	he	could	only	hold	her	against	his	chest	that	was	whitehot	with	love	and	belief	in	her		
he	would	have	to	get	all	his	plans	ready	in	such	a	rage	i	was	i	swung	my	limbs	to	torture	till	i	fell	sick	with	pain	'would	i	were	your	dog	said	i.		
but	now	she	was	out	of	it	uncontrolled	and	troubled	after	a	time	she	heard	the	hard	tread	of	her	husband	on	the	floor	below	and	without	herself	changing	she	registered	his	movement	by	and	by	the	vicar	came	in		
bachmann	watched	the	blind	foot	groping	in	space	for	the	ladder	and	he	felt	the	world	fall	away	beneath	him	but	in	two	of	them	was	the	one	will	that	bachmann	should	stay	with	emilie	down	this	path	past	the	well	and	out	by	the	white	gate	but	that	's	not	the	public	road	i	suppose	not

indeed	she	was	a	great	deal	free	of	him	unfortunately	his	smile	would	not	go	over	his	swollen	eye	which	remained	grave	and	lurid	hilda	appeared	last	and	the	clumsy	rawboned	clergyman	rose	to	meet	her		
there	in	a	cloud	of	smoke	she	found	whiston	playing	cribbage	she	went	upstairs	'give	me	your	hand	said	i.		
she	had	almost	gained	the	corner	of	the	house	when	a	heavy	step	came	crunching	through	the	trees	she	went	about	very	quietly	they	were	looking	gloomily	at	the	factory	and	for	a	moment	did	not	notice	the	girls		
he	stood	and	gazed	leaning	against	a	tree	he	was	kind	and	almost	anxiously	considerate	louisa	knew	the	ways	of	the	working	people		
what	do	you	find	to	like	in	him	he	said	with	a	hot	heart	yet	he	said	it	was	you	who	sent	me	the	way	i	have	gone	i	she	exclaimed	in	pride	his	head	was	thrust	forward	sunk	a	little	between	his	powerful	shoulders	and	the	strong	jaw	was	pushed	out	aggressively		
and	then	she	knew	he	would	speak	in	her	time	miss	mary	received	as	governess	a	few	little	daughters	of	tradesmen	miss	louisa	managed	the	house	and	went	among	her	father	's	churchgoers	giving	lessons	on	the	piano	to	the	colliers	daughters	at	thirteen	shillings	for	twentysix	lessons	come	away	from	the	door	jack	he	said	ineffectually		
she	looked	apart	from	him	and	his	world	gazing	away	to	the	sea	inside	was	a	tangle	of	twisted	débris	the	iron	in	parts	red	with	bright	rust	looking	still	hot	the	charred	wood	was	black	and	satiny	from	dishevelled	heaps	sodden	with	water	a	faint	smoke	rose	dimly	when	she	recovered	she	lay	translated	in	the	peace	of	satisfaction		
if	she	had	let	herself	she	would	have	hated	him	hated	his	padding	round	the	house	his	thin	voice	devoid	of	human	understanding	his	bent	little	shoulders	and	rather	incomplete	face	that	reminded	her	of	an	abortion	there	came	into	his	consciousness	a	small	foreign	sensation	at	home	they	would	need	her	now	mary	had	come		
what	was	the	worth	of	speaking	any	more	of	it?.he	felt	afraid	of	her	as	she	sat	there	as	he	began	to	grow	conscious	of	her	where	's	it	from	beauvale	records	fifteenth	century	beauvale	abbey	i	said	they	were	only	very	few	the	monks		
it	gave	her	a	delightful	mischievous	sense	of	liberty	it	had	an	uncertain	timid	look	about	it	he	looked	up	as	she	came	in	and	she	shrank	from	his	face		
and	he	's	got	it	yes	what	does	he	mean	by	that	she	lifted	her	shoulders	she	hurt	him	so	deeply	i	thought	i	did	he	replied		
there	was	a	strange	impersonality	about	his	low	exultant	call	that	appealed	to	her	irresistibly	she	was	the	beauty	and	the	clever	child	of	the	family	frances	knew	what	she	was	about		
what	was	he	as	he	sat	there	in	his	pitdirt?.the	young	clergyman	was	keenly	expected	she	did	not	think	about	her	husband		
no	she	would	not	feel	and	she	would	not	feel	men	's	low	voices	answered		
suddenly	from	one	of	her	lapses	into	silence	she	exclaimed	why	if	there	is	n't	mr	jack	lois	turned	suddenly	and	saw	her	brother	and	her	lover	approaching	her	louisa	was	busy	but	you	ca	n't	get	out	of	it	as	easy	as	that
