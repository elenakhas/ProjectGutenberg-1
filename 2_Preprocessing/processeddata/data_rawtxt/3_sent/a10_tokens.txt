do	you	keep	to	the	old	topics?.that	is	a	way	but	not	so	easy	as	you	think	your	answer	is	that	the	war	and	other	happenings	have	shown	you	that	age	is	not	necessarily	another	name	for	sapience	that	our	avoidance	of	frankness	in	life	and	in	the	arts	is	often	but	not	so	often	as	you	think	a	cowardly	way	of	shirking	unpalatable	truths	and	that	you	have	taken	us	off	our	pedestals	because	we	look	more	natural	on	the	ground

i	found	the	other	day	an	old	letter	from	henley	that	told	me	of	the	circumstances	in	which	he	wrote	that	poem	perhaps	the	saddest	lines	in	poetry	written	by	a	man	who	could	make	things	new	for	the	gods	themselves	they	have	come	to	thank	the	senatus	for	their	lovely	scroll	and	to	ask	them	to	tear	it	up		
the	greatest	scotsman	that	ever	lived	wrote	himself	down	a	failure	   	the	poor	inhabitant	below	   	was	quick	to	learn	and	wise	to	know	   	and	keenly	felt	the	friendly	glow	and	softer	flame	he	had	many	a	fault	well	known	to	them	he	was	not	always	so	noble	as	a	scholar	he	did	no	more	than	scrape	through	and	he	sometimes	made	his	father	rage	and	his	mother	grieve	my	socalled	labours	were	just	m'connachie	running	away	with	me	again

if	his	theme	were	the	rector	's	favourite	diligence	the	spring	of	the	year	lies	buried	in	the	fields	of	france	and	elsewhere	he	was	very	glad	she	was	such	a	pretty	mother		
it	is	always	easy	to	discover	where	a	fairies	ball	is	being	held	as	ribbons	are	stretched	between	it	and	all	the	populous	parts	of	the	gardens	on	which	those	invited	may	walk	to	the	dance	without	wetting	their	pumps	trumpets	brayed	the	moon	came	out	and	immediately	a	thousand	couples	seized	hold	of	its	rays	as	if	they	were	ribbons	in	a	may	dance	and	waltzed	in	wild	abandon	round	the	fairy	ring	peter	asked		
she	could	n't	help	it	maimie	craned	forward	eagerly	to	see	how	her	friend	fared	though	she	had	really	no	hope	no	one	seemed	to	have	the	least	hope	except	brownie	herself	who	however	was	absolutely	confident	peter	asked	tragically		
but	peter	hesitated	his	heart	the	doctor	said	remained	cold	he	would	not	eat	worms	or	insects	which	they	thought	very	silly	of	him	so	they	brought	him	bread	in	their	beaks		
i	should	like	to	she	answered	but	will	there	be	room	in	your	boat	for	two?'.he	popped	off	the	bed	and	opened	some	drawers	to	have	a	look	at	his	old	garments	she	did	a	very	kind	thing	she	took	off	her	scarf	and	gave	it	to	him		
when	a	real	bird	falls	in	flop	he	spreads	out	his	feathers	and	pecks	them	dry	but	peter	could	not	remember	what	was	the	thing	to	do	and	he	decided	rather	sulkily	to	go	to	sleep	on	the	weepingbeech	in	the	baby	walk	i	shall	tell	you	presently	how	he	got	his	paddle	she	said	there	was	only	time	now	to	walk	to	the	top	of	the	hump	and	back	and	as	they	trotted	along	with	her	she	little	guessed	what	was	thrilling	their	little	breasts		
another	good	plan	which	david	and	i	sometimes	follow	is	to	stare	them	down	but	maimie	's	curiosity	tugged	her	forward	and	presently	at	the	seven	spanish	chestnuts	she	saw	a	wonderful	light	between	the	well	and	the	round	pond	are	the	cricket	pitches	and	frequently	the	choosing	of	sides	exhausts	so	much	time	that	there	is	scarcely	any	cricket		
it	is	coming	nearer!'.he	remained	sitting	on	the	floor	and	held	his	breath	wondering	how	she	knew	that	he	had	come	back	he	can	not	with	dignity	retreat	but	he	stops	and	looks	about	him	as	if	lost	in	admiration	of	the	scenery	and	presently	he	strolls	away	with	a	fine	indifference	and	a	glint	at	me	from	the	corner	of	his	eye		
perhaps	the	drawer	had	creaked	at	any	rate	his	mother	woke	up	for	he	heard	her	say	peter	as	if	it	was	the	most	lovely	word	in	the	language	occasionally	swans	touched	on	the	island	and	he	would	give	them	all	his	day	's	food	and	then	ask	them	how	they	sat	on	the	water	but	as	soon	as	he	had	no	more	to	give	them	the	hateful	things	hissed	at	him	and	sailed	away	she	was	led	before	his	grace	and	the	doctor	putting	a	finger	carelessly	on	the	ducal	heart	which	for	convenience	sake	was	reached	by	a	little	trapdoor	in	his	diamond	shirt	had	begun	to	say	mechanically	cold	qui	when	he	stopped	abruptly		
no.'.they	are	grateful	little	people	too	and	at	the	princess	's	comingofage	ball	they	come	of	age	on	their	second	birthday	and	have	a	birthday	every	month	they	gave	him	the	wish	of	his	heart	nevertheless	there	was	a	very	disagreeable	incident	one	day	when	some	forward	girls	challenged	david	's	team	and	a	disturbing	creature	called	angela	clare	sent	down	so	many	yorkers	thathowever	instead	of	telling	you	the	result	of	that	regrettable	match	i	shall	pass	on	hurriedly	to	the	round	pond	which	is	the	wheel	that	keeps	all	the	gardens	going		
for	the	sweetest	craft	that	slips	her	moorings	in	the	round	pond	is	what	is	called	a	stickboat	because	she	is	rather	like	a	stick	until	she	is	in	the	water	and	you	are	holding	the	string	twilight	crept	over	the	gardens	and	hundreds	of	people	passed	out	including	the	last	one	who	always	has	to	run	for	it	but	maimie	saw	them	not	for	weeks	afterwards	you	can	see	the	ring	on	the	grass		
this	does	not	mean	that	they	are	black	for	night	has	its	colours	just	as	day	has	but	ever	so	much	brighter	they	then	said	welladay	and	such	is	life	for	they	can	be	frightfully	sarcastic	but	she	felt	sorry	for	those	of	them	who	had	no	crutches	and	she	said	goodnaturedly	before	i	go	to	the	fairies	ball	i	should	like	to	take	you	for	a	walk	one	at	a	time	you	can	lean	on	me	you	know.'.you	see	the	birds	were	always	begging	him	for	bits	of	it	to	line	their	nests	with	and	being	very	goodnatured	he	could	not	refuse	so	by	solomon	's	advice	he	had	hidden	what	was	left	of	it		
they	tried	to	dissuade	him	and	even	put	obstacles	in	the	way	but	he	thought	it	was	a	ball	and	jenny	wren	had	told	him	that	boys	kick	balls	so	he	kicked	it	and	after	that	he	could	not	find	it	anywhere	so	she	scudded	away	up	the	ribbon	calling	out	to	maimie	not	to	follow	lest	the	queen	should	mischief	her		
she	was	about	forty	round	the	waist	they	hold	their	great	balls	in	the	open	air	in	what	is	called	a	fairy	ring	but	peter	never	grows	any	older	and	if	we	could	be	watching	for	him	under	the	bridge	tonight	but	of	course	we	ca	n't	i	dare	say	we	should	see	him	hoisting	his	nightgown	and	sailing	or	paddling	towards	us	in	the	thrush	's	nest		
you	ca	n't	think	how	pleased	peter	was	to	learn	that	all	the	people	outside	the	gates	knew	about	him	there	were	thousands	of	little	people	looking	on	but	they	were	in	shadow	and	drab	in	colour	compared	to	the	glorious	creatures	within	that	luminous	circle	who	were	so	bewilderingly	bright	that	maimie	had	to	wink	hard	all	the	time	she	looked	at	them	every	living	thing	was	shunning	him		
another	was	lolling	on	a	garden	chair	reading	a	postagestamp	which	some	human	had	let	fall	and	when	he	heard	peter	's	voice	he	popped	in	alarm	behind	a	tulip	'what	's	this?'.oh	he	was	merry		
they	told	him	the	truth	about	hideandseek	and	he	often	plays	it	by	himself	but	even	the	ducks	on	the	round	pond	could	not	explain	to	him	what	it	is	that	makes	the	pond	so	fascinating	to	boys	well	you	can	see	their	houses	by	dark	but	you	ca	n't	see	them	by	day	for	they	are	the	colour	of	night	and	i	never	heard	of	any	one	yet	who	could	see	night	in	the	daytime	when	the	ayah	reached	the	gate	and	saw	tony	far	in	front	she	thought	her	other	charge	was	with	him	and	passed	out		
a	regiment	of	lancers	came	charging	down	the	broad	walk	armed	with	hollyleaves	with	which	they	jag	the	enemy	horribly	in	passing	very	reluctantly	peter	began	to	take	the	thimble	off	his	finger	but	it	is	not	it	simply	means	that	she	is	doing	as	she	has	seen	the	fairies	do	she	begins	by	following	their	ways	and	it	takes	about	two	years	to	get	her	into	the	human	ways		
after	this	it	was	most	orderly	he	quite	argued	with	her	as	if	she	could	hear	him	his	oddities	tickled	them	every	day	peter	wore	no	nightgown	now		
it	was	so	delicious	that	instead	of	flying	straight	to	his	own	home	he	skimmed	away	over	st.	paul	's	to	the	crystal	palace	and	back	by	the	river	and	regent	's	park	and	by	the	time	he	reached	his	mother	's	window	he	had	quite	made	up	his	mind	that	his	second	wish	should	be	to	become	a	bird	they	were	sitting	by	this	time	on	a	fallen	tree	peter	had	cleared	off	the	snow	for	maimie	but	he	sat	on	a	snowy	bit	himself	him	we	carried	in	triumph	to	our	other	friend	with	the	story	of	that	saturday	to	monday	and	never	shall	i	forget	the	gloating	joy	with	which	mr.	salford	leapt	at	him		
the	iron	bars	are	up	for	life	it	was	the	closing	of	the	gates	oh	dear	no		
then	peter	who	knew	them	for	the	fairies	called	out	that	he	was	not	an	ordinary	human	and	had	no	desire	to	do	them	displeasure	but	to	be	their	friend	nevertheless	having	found	a	jolly	harbour	he	was	in	no	temper	to	draw	off	therefrom	and	he	warned	them	if	they	sought	to	mischief	him	to	stand	to	their	harms	it	is	the	stickboat	that	is	freighted	with	memories	it	was	the	time	of	the	year	when	they	should	have	been	pairing	but	not	a	thrush	's	nest	was	built	except	this	big	one	and	so	solomon	soon	ran	short	of	thrushes	with	which	to	supply	the	demand	from	the	mainland		
but	he	did	not	play	with	his	precious	banknote	for	he	knew	what	it	was	at	once	having	been	very	observant	during	the	week	when	he	was	an	ordinary	boy	perhaps	a	human	voice	frightened	the	little	house	or	maybe	it	now	knew	that	its	work	was	done	for	no	sooner	had	maimie	spoken	than	it	began	to	grow	smaller	it	shrank	so	slowly	that	she	could	scarce	believe	it	was	shrinking	yet	she	soon	knew	that	it	could	not	contain	her	now	so	he	stretched	out	his	hand	to	pull	it	to	him	but	this	time	it	ran	at	him	and	he	was	so	alarmed	that	he	leapt	the	railing	and	scudded	away	to	his	boat		
then	he	would	make	her	presents	of	his	favourite	toys	which	he	always	took	away	from	her	next	morning	and	she	accepted	them	with	a	disturbing	smile	'of	course	they	might	want	your	clothes	he	had	to	admit	rather	falteringly	the	bowlegged	children	in	the	gardens	are	those	who	had	to	walk	too	soon	because	their	father	needed	the	perambulator		
illustration	when	you	meet	grownup	people	in	the	gardens	who	puff	and	blow	as	if	they	thought	themselves	bigger	than	they	are	peter	was	a	just	master	and	paid	his	workpeople	every	evening	but	she	looked	sad	and	he	knew	why	she	looked	sad	all	children	could	have	such	recollections	if	they	would	press	their	hands	hard	to	their	temples	for	having	been	birds	before	they	were	human	they	are	naturally	a	little	wild	during	the	first	few	weeks	and	very	itchy	at	the	shoulders	where	their	wings	used	to	be

how	could	you	get	across?'.you	see	though	still	a	tiny	child	it	was	really	years	and	years	since	he	had	seen	his	mother	and	i	dare	say	the	baby	who	had	supplanted	him	was	now	a	man	with	whiskers	and	but	will	it	wear		
there	was	a	good	deal	going	on	in	the	baby	walk	where	maimie	arrived	in	time	to	see	a	magnolia	and	a	persian	lilac	step	over	the	railing	and	set	off	for	a	smart	walk	certainly	it	would	be	pleasant	to	be	her	boy	again	but	on	the	other	hand	what	times	those	had	been	in	the	gardens!.they	asked	quite	surprised	and	really	peter	could	not	explain	how	he	knew		
but	she	spoke	no	more	she	made	little	moans	only	and	when	he	next	peeped	at	her	she	was	once	more	asleep	with	tears	on	her	face	that	i	am	afraid	is	how	peter	regarded	it	'not	at	all	cried	a	glowworm	if	she	were	to	wake	without	seeing	a	nightlight	she	might	be	frightened	so	i	shall	be	her	nightlight		
but	as	peter	sat	by	the	shore	tootling	divinely	on	his	pipe	he	sometimes	fell	into	sad	thoughts	and	then	the	music	became	sad	also	and	the	reason	of	all	this	sadness	was	that	he	could	not	reach	the	gardens	though	he	could	see	them	through	the	arch	of	the	bridge	maimie	cried	indignantly	for	she	knew	what	it	was	to	have	a	dripping	umbrella	about	your	ears	it	was	amazing	and	even	irritating	to	her	that	the	duke	of	christmas	daisies	should	be	able	to	keep	out	of	love	for	a	moment	yet	out	of	love	his	dusky	grace	still	was	you	could	see	it	by	the	shamed	looks	of	the	queen	and	court	though	they	pretended	not	to	care	by	the	way	darling	ladies	brought	forward	for	his	approval	burst	into	tears	as	they	were	told	to	pass	on	and	by	his	own	most	dreary	face		
the	reason	she	felt	no	more	fear	was	that	it	was	now	nighttime	and	in	the	dark	you	remember	maimie	was	always	rather	strange	which	shows	that	even	now	he	had	not	quite	forgotten	what	it	was	to	be	a	boy	many	nights	and	even	months	passed	before	he	asked	the	fairies	for	his	second	wish	and	i	am	not	sure	that	i	quite	know	why	he	delayed	so	long		
and	he	gasped	and	then	nodded	and	when	she	heard	talking	through	her	dreams	she	thought	it	was	mother	bringing	father	to	the	nursery	door	to	look	at	her	as	she	slept	the	highborn	fairies	obtain	this	admired	effect	by	pricking	their	skin	which	lets	the	blue	blood	come	through	and	dye	them	and	you	can	not	imagine	anything	so	dazzling	unless	you	have	seen	the	ladies	busts	in	the	jewellers	windows		
i	believe	no	one	could	teach	that	to	you	she	answered	adoringly	but	peter	thought	she	meant	that	he	was	stupid	perhaps	you	wonder	why	he	did	not	swim	across	they	then	said	welladay	and	such	is	life	for	they	can	be	frightfully	sarcastic	but	she	felt	sorry	for	those	of	them	who	had	no	crutches	and	she	said	goodnaturedly	before	i	go	to	the	fairies	ball	i	should	like	to	take	you	for	a	walk	one	at	a	time	you	can	lean	on	me	you	know		
maimie	could	also	see	the	pompous	doctor	feeling	the	duke	's	heart	and	hear	him	give	utterance	to	his	parrot	cry	and	she	was	particularly	sorry	for	the	cupids	who	stood	in	their	fools	caps	in	obscure	places	and	every	time	they	heard	that	cold	quite	cold	bowed	their	disgraced	little	heads	at	this	the	thrushes	began	to	fidget	which	made	peter	tremble	for	his	scheme	how	nice	that	would	be	to	him	but	oh		
having	escaped	the	danger	of	which	he	was	mercifully	carried	into	a	small	bay	where	his	boat	rode	at	peace	they	were	wheeling	a	handcart	with	the	flowers	in	it	and	were	quite	surprised	to	find	the	bed	occupied	poor	peter	uttered	a	little	moan	at	this	and	he	cried	for	the	first	time	for	i	know	not	how	long		
well	peter	pan	got	out	by	the	window	which	had	no	bars	'never	never!'.for	weeks	afterwards	you	can	see	the	ring	on	the	grass		
the	window	i	flew	out	at	will	be	open	peter	said	confidently	but	if	it	was	the	same	one	it	was	peter	pan	's	light	most	gladsome	sight	of	all	the	cupids	plucked	the	hated	fools	caps	from	their	heads	and	cast	them	high	in	the	air		
o	mother!'.you	see	the	chance	had	come	of	seeing	a	fairy	ball	when	they	came	up	to	whip	maimie	they	usually	found	her	sleeping	tranquillynot	shamming	you	know	but	really	sleeping	and	looking	like	the	sweetest	little	angel	which	seems	to	me	to	make	it	almost	worse		
you	must	not	think	that	he	meditated	flying	away	and	never	coming	back	peter	also	felt	strangely	uncomfortable	as	if	his	head	was	stuffy	he	heard	loud	noises	that	made	him	look	round	sharply	though	they	were	really	himself	sneezing	i	shall	tell	you	presently	how	he	got	his	paddle		
i	have	promised	to	tell	you	also	about	his	paddle	most	of	them	really	are	flowers	but	some	of	them	are	fairies	'if	i	chose	to	go	back	to	mother	he	asked	at	last	could	you	give	me	that	wish		
they	have	a	postman	but	he	never	calls	except	at	christmas	with	his	little	box	and	though	they	have	beautiful	schools	nothing	is	taught	in	them	the	youngest	child	being	chief	person	is	always	elected	mistress	and	when	she	has	called	the	roll	they	all	go	out	for	a	walk	and	never	come	back	but	the	kite	broke	to	pieces	in	the	air	and	he	would	have	been	drowned	in	the	serpentine	had	he	not	caught	hold	of	two	indignant	swans	and	made	them	carry	him	to	the	island	p.	is	written	on	the	corner	of	the	invitationcards	sent	out	by	all	really	good	families		
she	thought	her	coverlet	of	snow	was	a	warm	blanket	and	tried	to	pull	it	over	her	head	the	windows	were	the	size	of	a	coloured	picturebook	and	the	door	rather	smaller	but	it	would	be	easy	for	her	to	get	out	by	taking	off	the	roof	'maimie	he	said	will	you	marry	me		
replied	the	oak	bitingly	how	deliciously	cosy	it	is	to	stand	here	buttoned	to	the	neck	and	watch	you	poor	naked	creatures	shivering.'.'you	are	twenty	thousand	times	braver	than	tony	she	said	you	are	ever	so	much	the	bravest	boy	i	ever	knew.'.you	know	the	boards	which	tell	at	what	time	the	gardens	are	to	close	today		
that	she	had	to	come	out	and	show	herself	but	solomon	was	rightthere	is	no	second	chance	not	for	most	of	us	'and	if	you	want	very	much	to	give	me	a	kiss	maimie	said	you	can	do	it		
the	fairies	are	exquisite	dancers	and	that	is	why	one	of	the	first	things	the	baby	does	is	to	sign	to	you	to	dance	to	him	and	then	to	cry	when	you	do	it	'why	do	n't	you	go?'.'what	's	this	he	cried	and	first	he	shook	the	heart	like	a	watch	and	then	he	put	his	ear	to	it		
thank	you	she	replied	i	was	so	cosy	and	warm	it	was	under	a	limetree	near	the	entrance	to	the	fairy	queen	's	winter	palace	which	is	within	the	circle	of	the	seven	spanish	chestnuts	and	peter	approached	it	warily	for	the	birds	had	never	mentioned	such	things	to	him	peter	now	gave	him	a	pound		
he	was	a	poet	and	they	are	never	exactly	grownup	then	all	the	thrushes	hopped	for	joy	and	that	very	day	was	begun	the	celebrated	building	of	the	boat	but	there	is	also	a	way	of	finding	out	about	the	ball	before	it	takes	place		
she	stepped	out	by	the	roof	right	over	the	garden	and	then	she	saw	the	dear	house	in	which	she	had	passed	the	night	you	never	can	be	sure	of	them	but	a	good	plan	is	to	walk	by	looking	the	other	way	and	then	turn	round	sharply	he	could	scarcely	believe	she	meant	it	but	when	he	did	believe	he	screamed	with	joy		
if	you	think	he	was	the	only	baby	who	ever	wanted	to	escape	it	shows	how	completely	you	have	forgotten	your	own	young	days	'you	will	be	a	betwixtandbetween	solomon	said	and	certainly	he	was	a	wise	old	fellow	for	that	is	exactly	how	it	turned	out	lest	it	was	alive	he	addressed	it	politely	and	then	as	it	gave	no	answer	he	went	nearer	and	felt	it	cautiously		
he	can	not	with	dignity	retreat	but	he	stops	and	looks	about	him	as	if	lost	in	admiration	of	the	scenery	and	presently	he	strolls	away	with	a	fine	indifference	and	a	glint	at	me	from	the	corner	of	his	eye	perhaps	a	human	voice	frightened	the	little	house	or	maybe	it	now	knew	that	its	work	was	done	for	no	sooner	had	maimie	spoken	than	it	began	to	grow	smaller	it	shrank	so	slowly	that	she	could	scarce	believe	it	was	shrinking	yet	she	soon	knew	that	it	could	not	contain	her	now	the	crutches	were	the	sticks	that	are	tied	to	young	trees	and	shrubs		
how	exquisitely	delicious	it	would	be	to	her	she	was	disappointed	not	to	see	peter	pan	and	i	may	as	well	tell	you	now	why	he	was	so	late	that	night	they	traced	maimie	easily	by	her	footprints	in	the	snow		
that	was	the	beginning	of	fairies	this	enables	them	to	get	begun	half	an	hour	earlier	it	is	because	peter	wearies	for	summer	and	plays	that	it	has	come	and	the	chestnut	being	so	near	hears	him	and	is	cheated		
when	the	first	baby	laughed	for	the	first	time	his	laugh	broke	into	a	million	pieces	and	they	all	went	skipping	about	this	hoop	always	sank	at	once	but	he	waded	in	for	it	and	sometimes	he	dragged	it	gleefully	round	the	rim	of	the	pond	and	he	was	quite	proud	to	think	that	he	had	discovered	what	boys	do	with	hoops	when	david	heard	this	story	first	he	was	quite	certain	that	he	had	never	tried	to	escape	but	i	told	him	to	think	back	hard	pressing	his	hands	to	his	temples	and	when	he	had	done	this	hard	and	even	harder	he	distinctly	remembered	a	youthful	desire	to	return	to	the	treetops	and	with	that	memory	came	others	as	that	he	had	lain	in	bed	planning	to	escape	as	soon	as	his	mother	was	asleep	and	how	she	had	once	caught	him	halfway	up	the	chimney		
but	he	smoked	their	design	and	though	on	occasions	he	began	i	wish	he	always	stopped	in	time	but	peter	hesitated	you	will	see	presently	why	thrushes	only	were	invited		
he	looked	forward	to	retiring	by	and	by	and	devoting	his	green	old	age	to	a	life	of	pleasure	on	a	certain	yewstump	in	the	figs	which	had	taken	his	fancy	and	for	years	he	had	been	quietly	filling	his	stocking	maimie	stamped	her	foot	naughtily	and	was	putting	her	fingers	to	her	eyes	when	she	heard	a	kind	voice	say	do	n't	cry	pretty	human	do	n't	cry	and	then	she	turned	round	and	saw	a	beautiful	little	naked	boy	regarding	her	wistfully	what	a	glorious	boy	he	had	meant	to	be	to	her		
there	are	also	numbers	of	them	along	the	baby	walk	which	is	a	famous	gentle	place	as	spots	frequented	by	fairies	are	called	but	first	he	had	to	tell	the	birds	of	the	value	of	shelley	's	boat	and	though	they	were	too	honest	to	demand	it	back	he	saw	that	they	were	galled	and	they	cast	such	black	looks	at	solomon	who	was	rather	vain	of	his	cleverness	that	he	flew	away	to	the	end	of	the	island	and	sat	there	very	depressed	with	his	head	buried	in	his	wings	at	last	with	a	grand	design	burning	within	his	brave	heart	he	begged	them	to	do	it	once	more	with	him	clinging	to	the	tail	and	now	a	hundred	flew	off	with	the	string	and	peter	clung	to	the	tail	meaning	to	drop	off	when	he	was	over	the	gardens
