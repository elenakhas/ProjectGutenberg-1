he	became	aware	that	she	had	turned	her	eyes	upon	his	own	and	was	speaking	again	you	have	noticed	it	it	was	like	the	beginning	of	some	horrible	transformation	of	himself	into	something	else

the	music	of	the	band	had	ceased	the	moment	he	occupied	the	space	of	the	intruder	setting	his	feet	on	the	woven	roses	midway	in	the	line	of	travel	smoke	suddenly	stopped	purring	and	sat	down	we	have	few	visitors	so	that	on	entering	the	diningroom	we	were	prepared	to	find	miss	wragge	already	at	her	place	seated	in	a	sort	of	bathchair		
and	what	do	you	make	of	the	frenchman	in	the	train	i	asked	furtherthe	man	who	warned	him	against	the	place	à	cause	du	sommeil	et	à	cause	des	chats?.this	slim	creature	before	me	flitting	to	and	fro	with	the	grace	of	the	woodland	life	swift	supple	adroit	on	her	knees	blowing	the	fire	or	stirring	the	fryingpan	through	a	veil	of	smoke	suddenly	seemed	the	only	way	i	had	ever	really	seen	her	at	first	he	was	only	aware	that	the	dog	was	repeating	his	short	dangerous	bark	from	time	to	time	snapping	viciously	at	the	empty	air	a	foot	or	so	from	the	ground		
then	i	will	wait	here	with	the	dogs	and	we	’ll	have	a	look	at	the	laundry	on	our	way	home	i	turned	once	to	look	back	as	we	clambered	over	the	low	stone	wall	built	by	the	late	owner	and	saw	his	straight	soldierly	figure	standing	in	the	sunlit	field	watching	us	with	a	curiously	intent	look	on	his	face	he	would	have	screamed	for	help	but	remembering	the	emptiness	of	the	vast	building	and	the	loneliness	of	the	situation	he	understood	that	no	help	could	come	that	way	and	he	kept	his	lips	closed	and	the	contrast	pained	him	the	idealistic	dreamer	then	the	man	of	business	now	so	that	a	spirit	of	unworldly	peace	and	beauty	known	only	to	the	soul	in	meditation	laid	its	feathered	finger	upon	his	heart	moving	strangely	the	surface	of	the	waters

a	gentle	hissing	became	audible	in	the	air	and	the	doctor	moved	quickly	backwards	he	took	his	place	between	us	and	the	shadow	the	people	suffered	him	to	come	and	go	without	let	or	hindrance	though	it	became	clearer	to	him	every	day	that	he	was	never	free	himself	from	observation
