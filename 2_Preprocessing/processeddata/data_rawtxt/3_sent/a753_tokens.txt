the	interest	most	women	feel	in	politics	is	secondary	factitious	engrafted	on	them	by	the	men	nearest	to	them	it	is	to	us	the	symbol	of	all	that	may	be	great	and	good	and	noble	in	the	christian	republic	the	abuse	of	legislative	power	in	man	by	oppressing	the	sex		
when	the	creator	made	one	entire	sex	so	much	more	feeble	in	physical	powers	than	the	other	a	degree	of	subordination	on	the	part	of	the	weaker	sex	became	inevitable	unless	it	were	counteracted	by	increase	of	mental	ability	strengthened	by	special	precept	we	are	gravely	told	by	philosophers	that	with	the	vote	in	the	hands	of	woman	the	moral	elevation	of	the	race	is	secured	forever!.they	will	hold	it	with	greater	levity

women	have	thus	far	been	excluded	from	the	suffrage	precisely	on	the	same	principlesfrom	the	conviction	that	to	grant	them	this	particular	privilege	would	in	different	ways	and	especially	by	withdrawing	them	from	higher	and	more	urgent	duties	and	allotting	to	them	other	duties	for	which	they	are	not	so	well	fitted	become	injurious	to	the	nation	and	we	add	ultimately	injurious	to	themselves	also	as	part	of	the	nation	our	women	twenty	years	hence	shall	be	better	paid	in	some	of	their	old	fields	of	labor	and	new	openings	appropriate	to	their	abilities	mental	and	physical	shall	also	be	made	for	them	and	as	women	form	the	majority	of	the	resident	population	in	some	states	that	wretched	element	of	society	will	in	fact	govern	those	states	or	those	who	bribe	them	will	do	so		
choose	any	one	real	existing	abuse	as	a	test	of	the	honesty	and	the	liberality	of	american	men	toward	the	women	of	the	country	and	we	all	know	beforehand	what	shall	be	the	result	are	all	voters	true	to	their	high	responsibilities?.this	is	certainly	very	unjust	and	very	unwise

the	whole	history	of	mankind	shows	clearly	that	as	yet	no	one	legislative	act	has	ever	accomplished	half	of	what	is	claimed	by	the	advocates	of	woman	's	suffrage	as	the	inevitable	result	of	the	change	they	propose	their	premises	are	often	wholly	false	the	good	of	society	is	the	true	object	of	all	human	government

man	without	his	helpmeet	can	do	but	little	here	the	time	has	come	when	it	is	necessary	that	all	sensible	and	conscientious	men	and	women	should	make	up	their	minds	clearly	on	a	subject	bearing	upon	the	future	condition	of	the	entire	race	your	daughter	may	be	very	clever	but	she	would	certainly	run	away	on	the	battleheld	and	very	probably	draw	a	caricature	on	the	election	ticket		
these	exceptional	cases	temper	the	general	rule	but	they	can	not	abrogate	that	rule	as	regards	the	entire	sex	such	a	claim	can	not	logically	be	maintained	for	one	moment	in	the	face	of	existing	facts	so	it	has	been	with	the	question	of	female	suffrage		
and	thus	so	far	as	women	are	concerned	the	most	degraded	element	in	society	will	in	fact	represent	the	whole	sex	but	in	their	natural	condition	in	everyday	life	they	do	not	take	instinctively	to	politics	as	men	do	the	food	of	the	family	is	prepared	by	her	either	directly	or	by	close	supervision

it	seems	indeed	probable	that	under	the	new	era	our	great	elections	shall	become	a	sort	of	grand	national	gift	concerns	of	which	the	most	active	demagogues	of	all	parties	will	be	the	managers	to	women	this	class	of	duties	is	by	choice	and	by	necessity	much	more	absorbing	than	it	is	to	men	it	is	rather	the	fashion	now	among	literary	men	to	depreciate	queen	elizabeth	and	her	government		
but	all	these	individual	cases	whether	political	or	religious	have	been	exceptional	from	all	duties	entirely	public	she	is	now	or	she	may	be	if	she	choose	relieved	by	man	in	both	cases	half	the	functions	of	the	human	being	whether	physical	or	mental	would	be	very	imperfectly	performed		
to	oppose	wisely	skillfully	and	effectually	these	treacherous	encroachments	these	alluring	temptations	is	one	of	the	most	difficult	tasks	possible	it	is	clear	therefore	that	something	more	effectual	than	universal	manhood	suffrage	is	needed	to	stem	the	torrent	let	them	chat	walk	sing	dance	together	at	that	period	of	their	lives	but	if	you	wish	to	make	them	good	scholars	let	them	study	apart
