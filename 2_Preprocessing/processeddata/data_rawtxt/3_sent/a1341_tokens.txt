he	began	to	make	excuses	that	were	as	tiresome	as	himself	for	presuming	to	call	on	me	without	having	made	my	acquaintance	i	told	him	that	i	knew	him	very	well	as	the	nephew	of	our	cure	and	asked	what	i	could	do	for	him	but	you	are	not	my	lover	while	i	sat	there	i	saw	her	rise	from	time	to	time	and	whisper	something	to	the	farmer
