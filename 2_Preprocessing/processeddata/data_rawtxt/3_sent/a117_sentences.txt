Death!.Then 'twas "Turkey in the Straw" till your lips were nearly raw,       And you hurled your bold defiance at the Wild..The men who can't remember when they learned to swing a pack,       Or in what lawless land the quest began;      The solitary seeker with his grubstake on his back,       The restless buccaneer of pick and pan.		
We built our boats and we launched them..The riffles of his sluicingbox were choked with speckled earth,      And night and day he worked that lay for all that he was worth..We were climbing up a glacier in the neck of a mountain pass,      When the Dago Kid slipped down and fell into a deep crevasse.		
Ice, white ice, like a windingsheet, sheathing each smokegrimed wall;      Ice on the stovepipe, ice on the bed, ice gleaming over all;      Sparkling ice on the dead man's chest, glittering ice in his hair,      Ice on his fingers, ice in his heart, ice in his glassy stare;      Hard as a log and trussed like a frog, with his arms and legs outspread..They tended me and they brought me back to the world, and here I am..Some day you'll look and see not; futile and outcast of men,       I shall be far from your pity, resting forevermore.		
To think of the poor old mater awaiting her prodigal son..I met him later in a bar and made a gay remark           Anent an ancient miner and an option on the Ark..When thieves and thugs fall out and fight there's fell arrears to pay;      And soon or late sin meets its fate, and so it fell one day      That Clawfingered Kitty and Windy Ike fanged up like dogs at bay.		
sharpedged as a javelin, was that a woman's scream?.Thus toiled we, the army of fortune, in hunger and hope and despair,      Till glacier, mountain and forest vanished, and, radiantly fair,      There at our feet lay Lake Bennett, and down to its welcome we ran:      The trail of the land was over, the trail of the water began..I am going to God's Country, where I'll live the simple life;       I'll buy a bit of land and make a start;      I'll carve a little homestead, and I'll win a little wife,       And raise ten little kids to cheer my heart."		
"Then came I to a land I knew no man had ever seen,      A haggard land, forlornly spanned by mountains lank and lean;      The nitchies said 'twas full of dread, of smoke and fiery breath,      And no man dare put foot in there for fear of pain and death..With every mile of sea and land his longing grew and grew..She's as light as any fairy; she's as pretty as a peach;       She's mistress of the witchcraft to beguile;      There's sunshine in her manner, there is music in her speech,       And there's concentrated honey in her smile.		
He twists the thong from off his poke; he swings it o'er his head;       The nuggets fall around their feet like grain..Then there were days of drifting, breezes soft as a sigh;      Night trailed her robe of jewels over the floor of the sky..Just a dollar to help me out, I know you'll treat me white;      I'll do as much for you some day .		
Up sprang the redhaired Clancy, lean and eager of eye;       Loaded the long toboggan, strapped each dog at its post;      Whirled his lash at the leader; then, with a whoop and a cry,       Into the Great White Silence faded away like a ghost..I thrust in its maw the Fount of the Law; I fended it off with the Book..then calamity came.		
I only could peer and shudder and fear'twas ever so ghastly and still;      But I knew over there in his lonely despair        he was plotting me terrible ill..God knows what I bore that night when he swore        and bade me make tracks from his claim..He's the man from Eldorado, and he's had a bite and sup,       And he's met in with a drouthy friend or two;      He's cached away his golddust, but he's sort of bucking up,       So he's kept enough tonight to see him through.		
Leaping and boiling and seething, saw we a cauldron afume;      There was the rage of the rapids, there was the menace of doom..And strange it is; for, though they searched the river all around,      No trace or sign of black fox skin was ever after found;      Though one man said he saw the tread of HOOFS deep in the ground..Was this he, Tellus, this marble?		
Straight to his anvil he hurried; started his furnace aglow;      Heated his iron and shaped it with savage and masterful blow..I'll lie in my cell and listen; I'll wish that I couldn't hear      The laugh and the chaff of the fellows swigging the canteen beer;      The nasal tone of the gramophone playing "The Bandolier"..Ah, yes, it's the finish.		
It cries for its human tribute, but me it will never drown..I hew and I launch my cordwood, and raft it to Dawson town,       Where wood means wine and women, and, incidentally, hell..I thank you each for coming here; the happiness is mine       And now, you thieves and harlots, take it all."		
Where I have been won't matter; what I have seen I won't tell..The Ballad of GumBoot Ben           He was an old prospector with a vision bleared and dim..Spring!		
Night with its writhing stormwhirl, night despairingly black;       Night with its hours of terror, numb and endlessly long;      Night with its weary waiting, fighting the shadows back,       And ever the crouching madman singing his crazy song..She flitted sweetly through his dreams, she haunted him by day,      She smiled through clouds of nicotine, she cheered his weary way..I gazed at the coffin I'd brought for him,        and I gazed at the gruesome dead,      And at last I spoke:  "Bill liked his joke; but still, goldarn his eyes,      A man had ought to consider his mates in the way he goes and dies."		
The roses and lilies yearned to her,        as swift through their throng she pressed;      A little white, fragile, fluttering thing        that lay like a child on his breast.."I was sick, soulsick, of the futile chase, and there and then I swore      The foul fiend fox might scathless go, for I would hunt no more;      Then I rubbed mine eyes in a vast surpriseit stood by my cabin door..But I'll tell you nowand if I lie, may my lips be stricken dumb      It's a MINE, a mine of the precious stuff that men call radium.		
My blood seemed to freeze; I fell on my knees;        my face was a white splash of dread.."The skin is mine, all mine," she cried; "I did the deed alone.".They came through the door, they came through the floor,        they came through the mosscreviced logs.		
We joined the weltering mass,      Clamoring over their outfits, waiting to climb the Pass..But the one that cooked my bacon was Grubbe, of the City Patrol..I tried to refine that neighbor of mine, honest to God, I did.		
On!.I'm up on the bally woodpile at the back of the barracks yard;      "A damned disgrace to the force, sir", with a comrade standing guard;      Making the bluff I'm busy, doing my six months hard..In the heat of the hearthfire embers he heated the hideous Brand;      Twisting her fingers open, he forced its haft in her hand.		
Then all at once he grabbed my gun and he put it to his head,      And he says:  "I'll fix it for you, boys"them are the words he said.."From the vastitudes where the world protrudes        through clouds like seas upshoaled,      I held its track till it led me back to the land I had left of old      The land I had looted many moons..They know they've got him going; he is buying wine for all;       They crowd around as buzzards at a feast,      Then when his poke is empty they boost him from the hall,       And spurn him in the gutter like a beast.		
They drank unto his wife to bethat unsuspecting maid;       They drank unto his children half a score;      And when they got through drinking very tenderly they laid       The man from Eldorado on the floor.."      "It's getting dark awful sudden..We leapt from our benches.		
God knows what I did he should seek to be rid        of one who would save him from shame..Says he:  "Boys, here is where the shaggy North and I will shake;       I thought I'd never manage to get free..I'll never forget that bitter dawn, so evil, askew and gray,      When they wrapped me round in the skins of beasts        and they bore me to a sleigh,      And we started out with the nearest post an hundred miles away.		
"And strange though be, 'twas borne on me that land had lived of old,      And men had crept and slain and slept where now they toiled for gold;      Through jungles dim the mammoth grim had sought the oozy fen,      And on his track, all bent of back, had crawled the hairy men..That night the wife of his bosom, the light of joy in her eyes,      Kissed him with words of rapture; but he knew that her words were lies..So twenty years, with their hopes and fears and smiles and tears and such,      Went by and left me long bereft of hope of the Midas touch;      About as fat as a chancel rat, and lo!		
The supercilious cheechako might designate them high,      But one acquires a taste for them and likes them byandby..Lividlipped was the valley, still as the grave of God;       Misty shadows of mountain thinned into mists of cloud;      Corpselike and stark was the land, with a quiet that crushed and awed,       And the stars of the weird subarctic glimmered over its shroud..It's so in the town report.		
"Who's for a juicy twostep?".She slipped away as still he lay, she clutched the wondrous fur;      Her pulses beat, her foot was fleet, her fear was as a spur;      She laughed with glee, she did not see him rise and follow her..But the Lord took pity on my pain, and He led me to the sea,      And some icebound whalers heard my moan, and they fed and sheltered me.		
And one who defied it, a man of the Mounted Police;       Fought it there to a standstill long after hope was gone;      Grinned through his bitter anguish, fought without let or cease,       Suffering, straining, striving, stumbling, struggling on..I started to tell of the horrors of hell,        when sudden his eyes lit like coals;      And "Chuck it," says he, "don't persecute me        with your cant and your saving of souls.".He grips the table tensely, and he says:  "Dear friends of mine,       I've let you dip your fingers in my purse;      I've crammed you at my table, and I've drowned you in my wine,       And I've little left to give you butmy curse.		
At least they SAY that I did it..it sounds so queer       Alone, alone, alone!.The man who was fair as Apollo, godlike in woman's sight,      Hideous now as a satyr, fled to the pity of night.		
By day it's a ruthless monster, a callous, insatiate thing,       With oily bubble and eddy, with sudden swirling of breast;      By night it's a writhing Titan, sullenly murmuring,       Ever and ever goaded, and ever crying for rest..'Twas so far away, that evil day when I prayed to the Prince of Gloom      For the savage strength and the sullen length of life to work his doom..Oh, how we flogged the horses, staggering skin and bone!		
           Father, where is our boy tonight?.But no; they brewed me the greenspruce tea,        and nursed me there like a child;      And the homicide he was good to me, and bathed my sores and smiled;      And the thief he starved that I might be fed,        and his eyes were kind and mild..Pitched on his head, and pumped full of lead, was Dangerous Dan McGrew,    While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast      of the lady that's known as Lou.		
McGuffy is showing a bunch of the boys how Bob Fitzsimmons hit;     The barman is talking of Tammany Hall, and why the ward boss got fired..It makes us nutty; hang the astral chimes!.take back your spawn again.		
In the long, long night, by the lone firelight,      while the huskies, round in a ring,    Howled out their woes to the homeless snows       O God!.Then I ducked my head, and the lights went out,      and two guns blazed in the dark,    And a woman screamed, and the lights went up,      and two men lay stiff and stark..The reeling ranks of ruin swept along!		
There's a whisper on the nightwind, there's a star agleam to guide us,     And the Wild is calling, calling... let us go..Oh, they shook us off and shipped us o'er the foam,    To the larger lands that lure a man to roam;     And we took the chance they gave     Of a far and foreign grave,    And we bade goodby for evermore to home..Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.		
Tarry not, and fear not, chosen of the true;         Lover of the Lone Trail, the Lone Trail waits for you. The Pines    We sleep in the sleep of ages, the bleak, barbarian pines;    The gray moss drapes us like sages, and closer we lock our lines,    And deeper we clutch through the gelid gloom where never a sunbeam shines..Don't you remember that golden dream, with never a hint of pain,     Of lives that would blend like an angelsong       in the bliss of the coming years?.There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horrordriven,    With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;    It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say:      "You may tax your brawn and brains,    But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains."		
There are strange things done in the midnight sun          By the men who moil for gold;         The Arctic trails have their secret tales          That would make your blood run cold;         The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,          But the queerest they ever did see         Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge          I cremated Sam McGee. My Madonna    I haled me a woman from the street,     Shameless, but, oh, so fair!.Ah!.Oh, to have fallen!		
Drowned them like rats in my rivers, starved them like curs on my plains,    Rotted the flesh that was left them, poisoned the blood in their veins;    Burst with my winter upon them, searing forever their sight,    Lashed them with funguswhite faces, whimpering wild in the night;    "Staggering blind through the stormwhirl, stumbling mad through the snow,    Frozen stiff in the icepack, brittle and bent like a bow;    Featureless, formless, forsaken, scented by wolves in their flight,    Left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white;    Gnawing the black crust of failure, searching the pit of despair,    Crooking the toe in the trigger, trying to patter a prayer;    Going outside with an escort, raving with lips all afoam,    Writing a cheque for a million, driveling feebly of home;    Lost like a louse in the burning... or else in the tented town    Seeking a drunkard's solace, sinking and sinking down;    Steeped in the slime at the bottom, dead to a decent world,    Lost 'mid the human flotsam, far on the frontier hurled;    In the camp at the bend of the river, with its dozen saloons aglare,    Its gambling dens ariot, its gramophones all ablare;    Crimped with the crimes of a city, sinridden and bridled with lies,    In the hush of my mountained vastness, in the flush of my midnight skies..He sees the sullen pass, highcrowned with snow,     Where Afghans cower with eyes of gleaming hate..And though grim as hell the worst is, can you round it off with curses?		
Eating his heart out with a wild desire,     One day, behind his counter trim and neat,    He hears a sound that sets his brain afire      The Highlanders are marching down the street..They rule the world.."Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway;    From my ruthless throne I have ruled alone for a million years and a day;    Hugging my mighty treasure, waiting for man to come,    Till he swept like a turbid torrent, and after him swept  the scum.		
The waves tell of ocean spaces,     Of hearts that are wild and brave,    Of populous city places,     Of desolate shores they lave,    Of men who sally in quest of gold     To sink in an ocean grave..What have I lost!.And ah, it's strange; for, desolate and dim,     Between these two there rolls an ocean wide;     Yet he is in the garden by her side    And she is in the garret there with him.		
And hunger not of the belly kind, that's banished with bacon and beans,    But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it means;    For a fireside far from the cares that are, four walls and a roof above;    But oh!.Quatrains    One said:  Thy life is thine to make or mar,    To flicker feebly, or to soar, a star;     It lies with thee  the choice is thine, is thine,    To hit the ties or drive thy autocar..When he's on the blazin' desert an' his canteen's sprung a leak,     An' he's all alone an' crazy an' he's crawlin' like a snail,    An' his tongue's so black an' swollen that it hurts him fer to speak,     An' he gouges down fer water an' the raven's on his trail;    When he's done with care and cursin' an' he feels more like to cry,     An' he sees ol' Death agrinnin' an' he thinks upon his crimes,    Then he's like ter hev' a vision, as he settles down ter die,     Of the little ol' log cabin an' the roses an' the vines.		
These are the simple facts of the case, and I guess I ought to know..The Men That Don't Fit In    There's a race of men that don't fit in,     A race that can't stay still;    So they break the hearts of kith and kin,     And they roam the world at will..Have you wandered in the wilderness, the sagebrush desolation,     The bunchgrass levels where the cattle graze?		
The thought came back of an ancient wrong, and it stung like a frozen lash,    And the lust awoke to kill, to kill...      then the music stopped with a crash,    And the stranger turned, and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar way;    In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him sway;    Then his lips went in in a kind of grin,      and he spoke, and his voice was calm,    And "Boys," says he, "you don't know me, and none of you care a damn;    But I want to state, and my words are straight,      and I'll bet my poke they're true,    That one of you is a hound of hell... and that one is Dan McGrew.".Then cheer us for our glory now, and cheer us for our pain,     And cheer us as ye never cheered before.".but I'm weak  since the bitter dawn, and never a bite of food);    I'll just go over and slip inside  I mustn't give way to despair      Perhaps I can bum a little booze if the boys are feeling good.		
The wind is a mighty roamer;     He bids me keep me free,    Clean from the taint of the goldlust,     Hardy and pure as he;    Cling with my love to nature,     As a child to the motherknee..The flags were drooping sullenly, the men forgot to cheer;     We waited, and we never spoke a word..He seeks the lilyscented dusk beneath the orange tree;     His pipe in silence glows and fades and glows;    And then two little maids come out and climb upon his knee,     And one is like the lily, one the rose.		
"Money was just like dirt there, easy to get and to spend..Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway,    And I wait for the men who will win me  and I will not be won in a day;    And I will not be won by weaklings, subtle, suave and mild,    But by men with the hearts of vikings, and the simple faith of a child;    Desperate, strong and resistless, unthrottled by fear or defeat,    Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat..She sees a sea of faces like a dream;     She sees herself a queen of song once more;    She sees lips part in rapture, eyes agleam;     She sings as never once she sang before.		
So we took to wine and drink and other things,     And the devil in us struggled to be free;    Till our friends rose up in wrath, and they pointed out the path,     And they paid our debts and packed us o'er the sea..Sun, moon and stars give answer; shall we not staunchly stand,    Even as now, forever, wards of the wilder strand,    Sentinels of the stillness, lords of the last, lone land?.She ceases and is still, as if to pray;     There is no sound, the stars are all alight     Only a wretch who stumbles on his way,     Only a vagrant sobbing in the night.		
Oh, there is no chance!.They say:  "Could I find my proper groove,     What a deep mark I would make!".A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;    And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God!		
who made me, give me strength to face    The spectre of this bitter, black disgrace.".Have you suffered, starved and triumphed,      groveled down, yet grasped at glory,     Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?.I answered Her:  The choice is mine  ah, no!		
Well, the cherry bends with blossom and the vivid grass is springing,     And the starlike lily nestles in the green;    And the frogs their joys are singing, and my heart in tune is ringing,     And it doesn't matter what I might have been..And you'll find us in Alaska after gold,     And you'll find us herding cattle in the South..We pillar the halls of perfumed gloom; we plume where the eagles soar;    The Northwind swoops from the brooding Pole,      and our ancients crash and roar;    But where one falls from the crumbling walls shoots up a hardy score.		
Ha, ha!.We traded in skins and whiskey, and I've often slept under the shade    Of that lone birch tree on Bonanza, where the first big find was made..The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do things      Then listen to the Wild  it's calling you.		
Far away, so faint and far, is flaming London, fevered Paris,     That I fancy I have gained another star;    Far away the din and hurry, far away the sin and worry,     Far away  God knows they cannot be too far..I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;    But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;    I was sick with dread, but I bravely said:  "I'll just take a peep inside..Hark to the song where spheral voices blend:    "There's no beginning, never will be end."		
I guess I'll play on the red..And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;    Then "Here," said I, with a sudden cry, "is my crematoreum.".Plaguespots, yet tools of my purpose, so natheless I suffer them thrive,    Crushing my Weak in their clutches, that only my Strong may survive.		
His eyes are dark with doom;     He hears the shrapnel shrieking overhead;    He sees the ravaged ranks, the flamestabbed gloom..I am one of you no longer; by the trails my feet have broken,     The dizzy peaks I've scaled, the campfire's glow;    By the lonely seas I've sailed in  yea, the final word is spoken,     I am signed and sealed to nature..Master, I've filled my contract, wrought in Thy many lands;    Not by my sins wilt Thou judge me, but by the work of my hands.		
"On to the gates of Hell, my Gordons gay!".*    *    *    *    *    In many a Highland home, framed with rude art,     You'll find his portrait, roughhewn, stern and square;    It's graven in the Fuyam fellah's heart;     The Ghurka reads it at his evening prayer;     The raw lands know it, where the fierce suns glare;    The Dervish fears it..Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no;      then he says with a sort of moan:    "It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold      till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.		
I can hear them now..so cramful of cosy joy, and crowned with a woman's love     A woman dearer than all the world, and true as Heaven is true     (God!.Alone, alone he paced his narrow room,     In the bright sunshine of that Paris day;    Saw in his thought the awful hand of doom;     Saw in his dream his glory pass away;     Tried in his heart, his weary heart, to pray:    "O God!		
The red, red rose is faded now, and it's fifty years ago..A drivelling, dirty, ginjoint fiend, the butt of the barroom joke;     Sunk and sodden and hopeless  "Another?.Then the music swelled to a crash of joy, and the lights blazed up like day,     And I held her fast to my throbbing heart, and I kissed her bonny brow.		
Chance!.Cause and effect are grim, relentless powers..It's so long dark, and I'm lonesome  I'll just lay down on the bed;    Tomorrow I'll go... tomorrow...		
From out the mesh of fate our heads we thrust..It's all decreed  the mighty earthquake crash,    The countless constellations' wheel and flash;     The rise and fall of empires, war's red tide;    The composition of your dinner hash..Everything hard but headwork (I'd no more brains than a kid),    A brute with brute strength to labor, doing as I was bid;    Living in camps with menfolk, a lonely and loveless life;    Never knew kiss of sweetheart, never caress of wife.		
And glory crowns his life  and now the end,    The awful end..Each one a brand of this devil's land,      where I've played and I've lost the game,    A broken wreck with a craze for `hooch', and never a cent to my name..Dissolute, damned and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,    Ye would send me the spawn of your gutters  Go!		
Rise up in the morning with the will that, smooth or rough,                                            You'll grin..Beauty!.XI           She lies within an icy vault;           It glitters like a cave of salt.		
How bitterly I've cursed it, oh, the Painted Desert knows,      The wraithlike heights that hug the pallid plain,      The allbutfluid silence,  yet the longing grows and grows,      And I've got to glut the Wanderlust again..here on my morris chair      How I ache for the Northland!..		
XIV      Even as this line I write,      Do I know that she is near;      Happy am I, every night      Comes she back to bid me cheer;      Kissing her, I hold her fast;      Win her into life at last..Sting, little light, the shadows back!..		
What opportunity unmissed?...THE ICE IS JAMMED!  We've GOT to make the shore."		
..Sufferin' Caesar!..		
....They ran a base line, sluiced an' yelled, an' everyone wuz glad,      Except the balance of the property, an' he wuz "mad".		
That hit old Chewedear's funny side, so he lays back an' hollers:      "The day you raise a hair, old girl, you'll git a thousand dollars.".Yet oh, of power and conquest what a destiny is mine!.Here in those poor weak arms he died:      "Wolves will not get you, lad," I lied;      "For I will watch till Spring come round;      Slumber you shall beneath the ground."		
XV      The Sun!.I've gone the grilling pace that cannot last;      With bawdry, bridge and brandy  Oh, I've drank enough to kill      A dozen such as you, but that is past..They haled him harshly to a vaulted room,      Where One gazed on him with malignant eye;      And in that devilface he read his doom,      Knowing that ere the dawnlight he must die.		
....And if you came to our feast again, with its pomp and glee and glow,      I think you would sit stonestill, Tom Thorne, and see in a daze of dream,      A mad sun goading to frenzied flame the glittering gems of the snow,      And a monster muskox bulking black against the bloodred gleam.		
Sudden the cloud of darkness left my brain;      A velvet bar of sunshine pierced the room,      And in that mellow glory aureoled      She stood, she stood, all golden in its gold....Well, naturally all the boys soon tumbled to the joke,      An' at the Wowwow's Social 'twas Colddeck Davis spoke:      "The little woman's working mighty hard on Chewedear's crown;      Let's give her for a threefifth's share a hundred dollars down.		
..How maddening she must have been!.In the distant, dinful town just a little drink to drown       The cares that crowd and canker in my brain;      Just a little joy to still set my pulses all athrill,       Then back to brutish labour once again.		
Why do ye gape, ye fools!.The great sky soared exultantly, the great earth bared its breast,      All riverveined and patterned with the pine;      The heedless hordes of caribou were streaming to the West,      A land of lustrous mystery  and mine..The silence seems a solid thing, shot through with wolfish woe;      And rowelled by the eager stars the skies vault vastly back,      And man seems but a little mite on that weirdlit plateau.		
Anarch of all earthmisery;           Beggar and tramp and shameless sot;           Emblem of ill, in rags that rot..I come ..Hark!		
The heavens smile....Then my camp of a night;      Red and gold of the fireglow, net afloat in the stream;      Scent of the pines and silence, little "pal" pipe alight,      Body apurr with pleasure, sleep untroubled of dream:      Banquet of paystreak bacon!		
O wistful women I have loved before my dark disgrace!.Oh if I falter, fail to fight,           Can you, dear comrade, blame me quite?".He was long and slim and lean of limb, but strong as a stripling bear;      And by the right of his skill and might he guided the Long Brigade.		
No, 'twas a freak, a fancy of the brain,      (Oh, but tonight I'll try again, again!).That's Hellgate Canyon right ahead; I know of old its roar,      And ..Here in my den it's quiet; the seawind taps on the pane;      There's comfort and ease and plenty, the smile of the South is sweet.		
"Oh well I mind the sorry day you crossed the gurly sea;      'Twas like the heart was torn from me, a waeful wife was I..Is it for dear one you have lost?.He neither moaned nor moved his head.		
I can't get my bearings, I'm crushed and oppressed      With the haste and the waste of it all..With right good will let's climb the hill,      And leave behind all sorrow.."Mother, there's nothing more to eat            Why don't you go out on the street?		
And then I looked to Julie Claire, and sore abashed was I,      For from the robes that covered her, I  HEARD  A  BABY  CRY..No, 'twas a candle's trick, a shadow cast...		
They rounded up old Chewedear, an' they broke it what they'd done;      Allowed they'd bought an interest in his chance of raisin' hair;      They yanked his hat off anxiouslike, opinin' one by one      Their magnifyin' glasses showed fine prospects everywhere..For I think you are one with the stars and the sun,        and the wind and the wave and the dew;      And the peaks untrod that yearn to God, and the valleys undefiled;      Men soar with wings, and they bridle kings, but what is it all to you,      Wise in the ways of the wilderness, and strong with the strength of the Wild?.And looking back I must confess      I've little cause to feel elate.		
The bannered pomp, the gleam, the splendid urge!.The meadows of the muskox, where the laughing grasses grow,      The rivers where the careless conies leap..The evening sky was sinister and cold;      The willows shivered, wanly lay the snow;      The uncommiserating land, so old,      So worn, so grey, so niggard in its woe,      Peered through its ragged shroud.		
The campfire's a confessional  what funny yarns we spin!...He raised the head of the heedless Dead;       He fingered the frozen face.		
Till, tired at last, in a brook close by,       He washed off every stain;      Then softly up to the radiant sky       He rose, a god again.....		
Oh, would you know how earth can be      A hell  go north of Eightythree!...Oh, to see a coral dawn      Gladden to a crocus glow!		
"O hark the herald angels sing!"...some night the stars will gleam       Upon a cold, grey stone,      And trace a name with silver beam,       And lo!		
For there's a tiny wooden cross that pricks up through the snow:      (Poor Little Moccasins!.I think you would hear the bullmoose call, and the glutted river roar;      And spy the hosts of the caribou shadow the shining plain;      And feel the pulse of the Silences, and stand elate once more      On the verge of the yawning vastitudes that call to you in vain..from Julie Claire there came a wail of pain,      And then  the rope grew sudden taut, and quivered at the strain;      It slacked and slipped, it whined and gripped, and oh, I held my breath!		
X      Hark!.My lake has dreamed and loved since time was born;      Will love and dream till time shall cease to be;      Gazing to Her in worship half forlorn,      Who looks towards the stars and will not see       My peerless mountain, splendid in her scorn..*    *    *    *    *      'Twas in a ruder land, a wilder day.		
They roped in "tanks" from far and near, an' every test was sure,      An' like a flame there ran the fame of Deephole's Cowjuice Cure..I want to go back to my lean, ashen plains;      My rivers that flash into foam;      My ultimate valleys where solitude reigns;      My trail from Fort Churchill to Nome..Maybe 'twas God's  ah well, all's right.
