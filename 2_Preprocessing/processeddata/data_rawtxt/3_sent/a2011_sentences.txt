Nobody appeared to have a word for her, though there was an exceptional disposition to gossip..He had his handicap in life, but soon gave proof that if he was a Bradshaw it was an accident which other people would be wise to forget, fighting his way from the status of a butt till he was cock of the walk amongst the halftimers..I’m nobbut looking back to the times that used to be.		
This is where disbelief has brought you..Others, clockless, got up long before they needed and waited in the chill of early morning, at five o’clock, for the door to open..Goodnight.” CHAPTER VIITHE EARLY LIFE OF JOHN BRADSHAW ONCE upon a time, a West Indian slave owner was in conversation with three masterspinners and they spoke of labor conditions in the North of England.		
But it isn’t the case that you decide, Rupert..It’s so long sin’ we’ve seen thee,” he said..But, intimately, he would have his incomparable gain, the matchless joy of the creative artist working on apt material.		
You’re stunning,” he said at sight of her, stupidly and truthfully, missing the finer excellences of her frock, disconcerted by it simply because it was a frock..It’s mine..He reached for his hat.		
That portrait is of William, Edward’s son..It was unfortunate that Mrs. Verners clucked over him like a hen who has found a longlost chicken..She saw her expedition turning in its first engagement to triumphant victory, but she wanted the spoils of victory, she wanted a spade to be called unmistakably a spade, she wanted his declaration in round terms before he left that room.		
He was a worker in research, he was scientifically unemotional about the motive of his research, but he was on fertile ground here, and if he drew blank at Staithley Eisteddfod, then Lancashire was not the county he took it for..You’ve got no sense of humor,” he said..They were not formal tributes, they were chatty reminiscences hitting Rupert the shrewder because there was nothing conventional about them, bringing home to the son how his father had seemed to other eyes than his.		
They haven’t told you..Us had a hoamcoming ready for thee arter the war, but tha’ didno come.” No sirring and no obsequiousness from this old servant of the firm, and Rupert gave a quick, resentful glance as he pulled the car up in the yard..Indeed, indeed, she would rejoice with him.		
But I will do my duty.” It would, certainly, not have occurred to William in the first days of the war to convert their DyeHouse from, cotton dyeing to woolen: that sort of march into foreign territory, so extraordinarily lucrative, would have occurred to none but to Sir Philip, and they understood very well that under William, or under any of them now, the control would be prudent and uninspired..Still, there is a thing which puzzles me,” he said..He became expert in its politics and its gossip.		
Oh, do with me what you like..Technique could be acquired, and Mr. Chown did not condemn technique, but X was and it was not possible to acquire it..Are things as queer as they say?” What do they say?” asked Luke.		
Reuben never forgot that he belonged to the old order, was of it, and had married into it..Couldn’t you hear her?” I heard a streetsinger.” You heard a class voice, and you’re going to hear it again.” Mr..He might have been conscious that Dorothy had suddenly got up and thrown the curtains back from the window and had opened it and stood there now as if she needed air.		
She remembered that he had spoken of Sir Ralph as a profiteer, but had admitted that most of their friends were profiteers..Some crowded hours had passed when the memorialist at the table’s head unsteadily picked up a glass and saying mechanically, A glass of wine with you, sir,” found himself isolating from a ruddy haze the flushed face of Mr. Verners..I’ll break your neck.” Tom, Tom!” protested Walter.		
Does he?” said Mary listlessly..I doubt whether a factory, controlled by a strong hand, has anything to fear from Workmen’s Combinations.” Damn it, look at Blackburn!” You shall have my decision when it is ready..Not yet,” he said.		
We leadnot exclusively but we are of the leadersin Lancashire..In the heat of argument, she had felt confident of her weapon and now she doubted if it were a weapon or hers to use..I’ve no reply to that,” he said.		
I am trying to be just.” Just?” And, believe me, trying not to be smug..You’ll be SansGêne in ‘The Duchess of Dantzig.’ ” I didn’t tell you I’m retiring from the stage, did I?.We go into the question of price, and we quote the figure to these accountants.		
Think it over, old man,” he said earnestly..Go back to the hymn,” he said..Shooting?		
But there is Tom.” Young Tom Verners was with his regiment in the Peninsula..They rarely lived to see forty..I want to see you urgently.		
But I’m not doubting it.” What we can do, at any rate, is to go together through the records of the firm..If Rupert was developing anything, it was listlessness..Brickyards, mostly,” she said.		
That was all, bare decency, not the flaunting parody with plumes and gin of the slightly less poor: nor were there many mourners..Well?” he asked..In the ranks, though.		
Darley wasn’t looking at the stage, he was looking at the audience and he knew triumph when he saw it..He tried again, with an earnest spinsterish lady who looked strongminded enough for anything: and the girl had him in the fraction of a minute..Sir Philip’s widow knew, if Mrs. William didn’t, what was incumbent on a Hepplestall.		
Yesterday he was in hell and tomorrow, very likely, he would swear if the waiter at the hotel brought up tepid tea to his bedside; but tonight he hadn’t made adjustments, tonight he was impressible by amenity..His place was at the source, at the mills, a standardbearer of the cotton trade, a manufacturer first and a salesman and distributor only by proxy..It isn’t yet, but he’s in danger, and he can be saved.		
If there are forms to go through refer the officials to me.” In the factory they called him Master.” He was master of them all..Come on the stage and we’ll see what you have got..Harry had won forgiveness, Dorothy decided, and if he came next day in wooing vein it wasn’t she who would check his ardor a second time.		
It closes the account.” No..But what are these but the freaks we all enjoy in London?.He was the spring wound up by Mr. Barraclough; now he had acted and he was relaxed; he was relaxed and happy.		
Staithley’s the one place that’s absolutely barred.” Rupert, you’re making me responsible..No..You are one of the right people, but there is work before you.		
I’m nearer earth than that.” Never for me,” he protested..He was, therefore, sparing in his tutorship when they had come into his room and handled the gun together..But Annie’s gypsy strain kept her immune from any such fears: her ancestors had traded in superstition.		
If I were a sculptor” Seriously, Rupert, I’m going to fight this..She was arousing his worst, she was reawakening his rebellion to the thought that he had had his fling, she was tempting him to continue it in the hope that when his fling was ended, Mrs. Verners would have, mercifully, also ended..Barraclough had given him a goal, and an outlet for all his pentup emotion.		
She knew how Jacques and Phoebe, though they only met when this tour began, had been married last week at..Electric trams bumped up the inclines through sprawling mainstreets off which ran the rows upon uniform rows of celllike houses, backtoback, airless, bathless, insanitary, in which the bulk of the workers lived..She exercised fastidious selectiveness, but, having chosen, gave her company at costly meals to young officers who returned to France swaggering in soul, mentioning aloud with infinite casualness that they had lunched with Mary Arden.		
Tom made a move..I didn’t think they’d go for Hepplestall’s..She had been idealizing Harry since the precious token came and he camelike this, lurching, thickvoiced, beastly.		
Aye,” said Needham, Aye.” He finished the bottle, since nothing more substantial was forthcoming, and rose to go..As a captain of the light entertainment industry, he was doing exceedingly well out of the war; he had a high opinion of the Colonial soldiery; the young British officer was hardly behind the Colonial private in his eagerness to occupy Mr. Rossiter’s stalls, and at times when leave was suspended the civilian population filled the breach in its very natural desire for an antidote to anxiety..Peter.		
O'Cal..Bad form to make the pace hotter than the regular rate..Glad.		
Someone's ready to keep her..Peter, oh, my dear, dear Peter!.You're lying now.		
I can't ask you to marry me yet because I am not rich..He leans back in the armchair, yawning and consulting his watch, glancing at Gladys, entrenched behind her book, again yawning and making up his mind to address her. ***** Fred, (nursing a grievance)..Don't go.		
By the way, you're here yourself, you know..Mrs. G. Say yes to them, Peter..That's my son.		
I quite agree..[Peter appears outside door right, pulling it to him. Peter (off)..Peter.		
Fred..Fresh air will do you good..Fred.		
Margaret stands left, in some confusion..I begin to think you never mean to marry me..Peter.		
Comrade Garside, I offer my congratulations..(Slight pause.) Tell me this..Ned.		
Ned..But I particularly want to go to the Club..Freddie rises. Fred.		
We want workers..[Peter looks from one to the other like a caged animal. Ned (with genuine feeling)..She will now.		
Don't you believe it, miss..Peter..Glad.		
Well, you can meet him..Yesthere's money in it..Mar.		
Peter..[Shouts more fiercely. Fred, (helplessly irritable)..As I'm strong and you're weak, I ought to win.		
Jones..Every night I can make myself the master of a mob..Peter.		
Peter..(putting his hand on Peter's shoulder)..Gladys enters, meeting Jones' eye. Glad.		
All right..Peter..O'Cal.		
You've missed your ehanee to speak..Lady M. (turning)..Fate didn't mean us two to miss each other.		
Mrs. Garside sighs heavily, rouses herself slowly, crosses and opens door..Peter..I'll lay the table.		
Peter (deliberately)..We've our livings to earn..I am indisposed.		
Peter..Glad..Peter.		
He enters wearily, forgetting himself for a moment on seeing Margaret and speaking vigorously. Peter..Light wall colouring and carpet..Glad.		
I'll write..Oh, what's the use of that?.I'm making money, Miss Mottram, and I'm going to make more.		
(Coming to chair right and sitting, Mrs. Garside is to his left, Margaret his right.) In a few days it 'ull seem matter of fact enough to be Labour candidate for the division..Fred..Peter.		
[Enter Timson. Timson..My employment is in your hands..She knows she's not fit to go up with you, so she's trying to keep you where you are.		
Peter..Mrs. G. Then I think I'll go to my bed..Bit of a responsibility for any face.		
Fred..Well, I do like to be generous..Yes, my lady.		
Mar..Peter..Oh, conscience is so much a matter of climate.		
Do you want to very much?.ELLEN           Come back, lass..Hae ye made the bed?		
POLLY           Naw, ye’ll no’..[The door from the bedroom has been           opening slowly, and Mary listens..MARY           Why did ye no’ shout on us frae yer           room?		
MARY           Naw..MARY           It’s a wee sherp this mornin’ too..A tell’t ye A’d gie ye yer           answer the nicht an’ ye’ll huv tae wait           till the nicht fur it.

He tak’s a pride in           bein’ at the pithead regular for the           first cage gaun doon; he’d be rare an’           mad wi’ me if A brung him back fur           naethin’..A wis only a wee lassie           then, bit ma mither had nae mair sense           nor tae let me oot tae the pit—heid tae           see the bodies brung up..MARY           (puzzled by her appearance, decides to           be consoling) Weel, A’m sorry ye left           yer bed fur naethin’, before the room’s           aired tae.		
A must go..POLLY           It’s a handy thing tae huv aboot the           hoose..Ye’ve never           tell’t me hoo it happen’t.		
A’m no’ gaun back..POLLY           But it’s a comfort tae think he’ll no’           be burnt..Come an’ sit quiet, ravin’ aboot as if           ye were mad.		
Ye’ll stay whaur ye           are..We ken           naethin’ yit, an’ if we did, greetin’           ‘ll no’ mend it..ELLEN           Come in, wull ye?		
JOCK           (as he opens the door slowly, morn has           broken fully, and a hard grey light           enters the room)           A’ll be hame pretty quick so ye’ll           better be ready..(She rises from her           chair.).POLLY           Aye.		
Look at the clock..JOCK           Rats wur busy at it yesterday whin A           cam’ to pit my pick doon an look fur ma           dinner..There wis mair than twinty kill’t that           time an’ mebbe forty or mair that wis           hurt.		
It wis only a fancy..It           tak’s mair than a year or twa tae git           intae the wey o’ pits when ye’re born           strange tae them..A’d best shut the door, tac, an’           keep oot the row or she’ll be wantin’           tae go.		
ELLEN           Only an auld wife’s fancy, lass..JOCK           (tasting)Aye..It’s a thing ye cannae forget.		
ELLEN           There’ll be plenty fills o’ wimmen there           seein’ whit’s up and keepin’ the men           frae their wark, withoot you gaun an’           helpin’ them tae dae it..ELLEN           Aye..MARY           Why no’?

JOCK           It’s wi’ thinkin’ o’ you, lass..Ye sit there quiet an’ calm as if           there wis naethin’ the maitter..We’ll hae tae keep her           mind aff it.

ELLEN           Aye..ELLEN           Naw..Bless the lass, whit’s the use o’           that!		
Mary, left alone, begins to           tidy up and prepare the house for the           use of the day..The doctors were there           afore A come away, and ambulance men tae           wi’ aw they’ll need..MARY           Bit whit can we dae?		
ELLEN           Oh aye, he’s a good lad..ELLEN           A’ll be ready..ELLEN           Ye’d better dae it then.

[Mary goes to the bedroom again..MARY           Yes, auntie..Rushin’ oot tae the pitheid ‘ll dae ‘im           nae guid.		
Eh, it micht a’           been yesterday..Seems as if it wis only the ither day A           heard the bell ringin’ an’ saw ma man           brung up..Come tae           mention’t, it’s a funny thing.
