Or else, perhaps, does she, like the dog in the fable, "the dog that carried his master's dinner round his neck," knowing that all is irreparably lost, prefer to die taking her share of the pillage and to pass from life to death in one prodigious orgy?.We say to it, for instance: If, at the moment of undertaking an affair, we could know that its outcome would be unfortunate, we should not undertake it; and, since it must be written somewhere, in Time, before our question has been put, that the affair will not take place, seeing that we abandon it, we could not, therefore, foresee the outcome of that which will have no beginning..But in France it would be a pity to return to it.		
Such words as these, addressed to the crowd, are very true; but it is no less true that all this becomes efficacious only after it has been experienced and lived through..The eye recognizes with emotion the familiar colours faded by the centuries; and the picture is always full of a plaintive grace..So as not to lose ourselves in this road, which would lead us whither nothing calls us, it will be enough for us to say that the Future, like all that exists, is probably more coherent and more logical than the logic of our imagination and that all our hesitations and uncertainties are included in its provisions.		
VIII What flowers, then, blossomed in the gardens of our fathers?.O strange infirmity of our eyes, our ears and that brain of which we are so proud!.It follows a uniform and inflexible curve.		
"Oh, do not fear him.....In future, they will have to avoid the imperceptible but insuperable cleft where will always watch the little jet of flame that turned them back..If he who receives the avowal cannot rise to the height of loving us the more for that avowal, there is a misunderstanding in our love.		
With an unquestioning certainty, an unconstraint and a simplicity that surprise us a little, deeming us better and more powerful than all that exists, he betrays, for our benefit, the whole of the animal kingdom to which he belongs and, without scruple, denies his race, his kin, his mother and his young..But what shall happen if the image takes life and comes forth from her retreat to enter upon an existence in which all that does not take part in the movement that surrounds it becomes a pitiful or dangerous wreck?.In itself we may be almost certain that it is but an immense eternal, motionless Present, in which all that takes place and all that will take place takes place immutably, in which ToMorrow, save in the ephemeral mind of man, is indistinguishable from Yesterday or ToDay.		
A mere nothing, a stray lock, a fold of a garment that is not in its customary place, a tense muscle, makes them unpleasing or suspicious, pretentious or hard..They have completed the conquest of the globe..Many of our defects are the very roots of our good qualities.		
It says to itself that it will have to cover tomorrow the road which it did not travel today and that, in the meantime, by thus wasting its time between every stage, it has nothing to gain but a little delusive peace..But the monster, I say to myself, has no secrets that I have not learned..In any case, it is the best preparation for that which must inevitably come.		
Chastity, which sat waiting with eyes closed and hands folded, has the right to change into passion, which shall decide and settle destiny..Is it better or worse that the active or the passive virtues should stand in the foreground?."Her conscience is so natural and so sound that we do not hear it breathe and that she appears unaware of its existence.		
He is our intimate and impassioned slave, whom nothing discourages, whom nothing repels, whose ardent trust and love nothing can impair..On the contrary, the more the republic prospers, the more harshly and severely are its laws applied, and the worker in a hive where superfluity accumulates labours much more zealously than her sister in an indigent hive..Is there a risk in approaching the hives?		
Almost all persuade themselves that Chance reserves for them special and premeditated favours or misfortunes..Deliberately, they cast off from it sentiment, imagination, all that does not properly belong to it..The Spanish Bean, a native of South America, and the Sweet Pea, an immigrant from Sicily, number a little over two hundred years.		
They are not the highpriests, but the officeclerks of Hazard..Is to refrain from harming enough to make one kind, to refrain from lying enough to make one true?.In any case, her devotion and sacrifice will never be resigned, will never abandon themselves to the perfidious sweetness of sorrow.		
Hence the eagerness with which modern dramatists have plunged into all the problems of contemporary morality; and it may safely be said that at this moment they confine themselves almost exclusively to the discussion of these different problems..And where shall we look for that exquisite summer's night, which owes its vastness, its savour, the very appeal that it makes to us, to the shadow of an heroic, inevitable death that already lay heavy upon it?.FOOTNOTE: [2] Other subjects of my inquiries gave me less curious, but often analogous results.		
On the other hand, however, the highest point of human consciousness is attained by the dramas of Björnson, of Hauptmann, and, above all, of Ibsen..IV It behoves us, therefore, in general, to praise those who do not allow themselves to be offended with impunity..It is thus that honour, in the chivalrous, conjugal sense of the word (I refer to the honour of the husband, which is supposed to suffer by the infidelity of the wife) that revenge, a kind of morbid prudishness, pride, vanity, piety to certain gods, and a thousand other illusions, have been, and still remain, the unquenchable source of a multitude of duties that are still regarded as absolutely sacred, absolutely incontrovertible, by a vast number of inferior consciousnesses.		
It is the blindest and most unequal of weapons; and, since it evades all the conditions that adjust the chances of two illmatched adversaries, it involves exaggerated reprisals on the part of the beaten combatant, which end by arming him with the stick, the knife or the revolver..Of all the feminine passions, none has perished, none is a prisoner, for all are needed, the humblest and most futile and the greatest and most dangerous alike, to form the perfume that love loves to breathe..III I thought it curious to inquire where this science of the Future stands today.		
But it is no less true that, upon trial, at the moment when you rely upon the assistance of the surest phantom, it vanishes abruptly and leaves you face to face with the unknown which it was masking..Not an unaccustomed word or gesture..We at once grasp the dominant idea, the obtrusive beauty, the unexpected effort of the year in this special world, strange and privileged even in the midst of the strange and privileged world of flowers.		
The fault itself we have eliminated from our being..I began by selecting a moment at which a certain project, whose realization (which did not depend upon myself alone) was to be of great importance to me, was hanging in suspense..II The interior corresponds with the exterior.		
"Yes, yes, I see; don't be afraid, I'll help you; you will be pleased...." "But the enemy of whom you told me; the one who is resisting me and who wishes me ill...." "No, no, he wishes you no ill, it's because of some one else.....Lastly, to enable us to handle the bees almost without impunity, there exist a certain number of little expedients which vary according to circumstances and which can be learnt by practice alone..Is he intended only for us to play with, to amuse the leisure of our eyes, to adorn or enliven the home?		
It concerns us to take account of this..For the rest, it is quite possible that the dog, or rather the inaccessible genius of his race, troubles scarcely at all about us and that we have merely known how to make use of various aptitudes offered by the abundant chances of life..And, now that it snorts at my feet, I can recall its physiology.		
It is, among familiar plants, the most submissive, the most docile, the most tractable and the most attentive plant of all that we meet on life's long way..They are not many and they conceal themselves: they are gnarled oaks, beeches, planes; and even the vine, which one would have thought bettermannered, more docile and wellinformed, remains incredulous..We suffer, or make others suffer, we love, we die, there in our corner; and it were the strangest chance should a door or a window suddenly, for an instant, fly open, beneath the pressure of extraordinary despair or rejoicing.		
Illusion is the opaque veil woven with the ephemeral threads called Yesterday, Today and ToMorrow, which we embroider on those realities..For when the sun has entered into the consciousness of him who is wise, as we may hope that it will some day enter into that of all men, it will reveal one duty, and one alone, which is that we should do the least possible harm and love others as we love ourselves; and from this duty no drama can spring..II It is this insatiable need which, on those points where human justice remained dumb and declared itself powerless, appealed in former days to the judgment of God.		
Admitting the ruin, it looks as though already, in her instinct, she saw the future dwelling which she hopes to build with the materials taken from the gutted town..According to others, it obeys certain rhythms that are easily grasped..But that which regards us, that which is within our reach, that which is to unfold itself within the little sphere of years, a secretion of our spiritual organism, that envelops us in Time, even as the shell or the cocoon envelops the mollusc or the insect in Space; that, together with all the external events relating to it, is probably recorded in that sphere.		
If, after its realization, it should become apparent that the ideal does not fulfil its promise, it will then be meet that we should think of perfecting or replacing it..This rational being, who has a soul      and professes some religion, comes home tired and half starved, but      very pleased with his day's work: he has seen some tulips..Humbly it interrupts or diverts the order preestablished by nature.		
But soon it grows frantic, springs forward, and throws itself madly upon me, rushing under the car like a furious torrent, whose foam lashes my face; it drowns me beneath its waves, it blinds me with its breath..She is inflexible towards the activity which she directs, but with such ease that she seems to be stopping to rest or to bend over a flower when she is with all her strength resisting an unjust feeling or thought..He enjoyed not only their dazzling presence: he also hopedprobably unwisely, so deep and confused is that mysteryhe also hoped, by dint of questioning them, to surprise, with their aid, I know not what secret law or idea of nature, I know not what private thought of the universe, which perhaps betrays itself in those ardent moments in which it strives to please other beings, to beguile other lives and to create beauty.		
In their hours of distress they have discovered new forces to cling to, that seem trustworthy, human and just; and behold them thrust back to a century wherein prayer and the sword decide all!.Here and there, one of them, right at the bottom of the apothecary's or herbalist's jars, still awaits the coming of the sick man faithful to the infusions of tradition..We should, it is true, in nature have other splendid manifestations of luxury, exuberance and grace; other dazzling efforts of the superfluous forces: the sun, the stars, the varied lights of the moon, the azure and the ocean, the dawns and twilights, the mountain, the plain, the forest and the rivers, the light and the trees and, lastly, nearer to us, birds, precious stones and woman.		
Enchanted gardens, where blossom in January all the flowers of spring, summer and autumn, sweetscented thickets that borrow nothing from the hostile seasons but their perfume and their smiles lie before its porch..The seer in question is one of the most famous in Paris..Should a youth of our own time love, and meet obstacles not unlike those which, in another order of ideas and events, beset Romeo's passion, we need no telling that his adventure will be embellished by none of the features that gave poetry and grandeur to the episode of Verona.		
There they stand, black and gaunt, like sick people on an Easter Sunday in the churchporch made transparent by the splendour of the sun..So soon as, from that standpoint, we see our instincts, even the lowest and the most selfish, at work, provided that we are not wilfully wickedand it is difficult to be that when our intelligence has acquired the lucidity and the force which this faculty of observation impliesso soon as we see them thus at work, they become harmless, like children under their parents' eyes..Today, all this appears to us so profoundly impossible that we find it difficult to imagine how the certain reality of the Future would refute the objections which we make to it in the name of the organic illusion of our minds.		
And we ask ourselves if this new idea is a profound and really necessary idea on the part of the sun, the earth, life, autumn, or man..Do not believe, either, that, by setting yourselves to the number of ten thousand who do not know against one who knows, you will come to know anything, or that you will compel the humblest of the eternal laws to follow you, to abandon him who recognized it..That is why no traveller would take it into his head to maintain that the towns which he has not yet visited will become real only at the moment when he sets his foot within their walls.		
Certainly there was in his intuition something more than a fortunate coincidence..To the other, who asked her how a lawsuit would end, she replied somewhat evasively on that point; by way of compensation she spontaneously revealed the spot where lay a certain object which had been very precious to the person consulting her, but which had been so long lost and so often looked for in vain that this person was persuaded that he had ceased to think about it..Would you go to him whose shake of the head had sullied a generous action or a mere impulse that was pure?		
Look through the passive correspondence of any man, and you shall find in it an astonishing unity..Let us be humble, and learn to distinguish between accident and essence..Thus do I conceive it to be with Hilda and Solness; it is thus surely that they regard each other.		
But all this is nothing, and is not even near to the outer lights of the abyss..Happily, even in those whose vision is most limited, there is always something that acts in silence as though they had seen..It was the nature of disaster with which the earliest tragic writers were, all unconsciously, preoccupied, and this it was that, though they knew it not, threw a solemn shadow round the hard and violent gestures of external death; and it is this, too, that has become the rallyingpoint of the most recent dramas, the centre of light with strange flames gleaming, about which revolve the souls of women and of men.		
Every evening will its sisters recognise the soul that pronounced the word, and henceforth, be the conversation never so trivial, its mere presence will, I know not how, add thereto something of majesty..Is it indeed essential that your mother should breathe her last in your arms, that your children should perish in a shipwreck, and that you yourself should pass by the side of death, for you at length to understand that you have your being in an incomprehensible world where you shall be for ever, where an unseen God, who is eternally alone, dwells with His creatures?.It is death that is the guide of our life, and our life has no goal but death.		
And it is from this moment that he truly belongs to us..But others there are who linger for a moment, who look at us with an eager smile, and seem to be on the point of confessing that they know all; and then, towards their twentieth year, they leave us, hurriedly, muffling their footsteps, as though they had just discovered that they had chosen the wrong dwellingplace, and had been about to pass their lives among men whom they did not know..What was there that divided us from them?		
I have known more than one man who performed every act of kindness and mercy without touching a single soul; and I have known others, who seemed to live in falsehood and injustice, yet were no souls driven from them nor did any for an instant even believe that these men were not good..Thousands and thousands of laws there are, mightier and more venerable than those of passion; but, in common with all that is endowed with resistless force, these laws are silent, and discreet, and slowmoving; and hence it is only in the twilight that they can be seen and heard, in the meditation that comes to us at the tranquil moments of life..It is only the life of violence, the life of bygone days, that is perceived by nearly all our tragic writers; and truly may one say that anachronism dominates the stage, and that dramatic art dates back as many years as the art of sculpture.		
There are moments when it would seem as though we were on the threshold of a new pessimism, mysterious and, perhaps, very pure..Would she, like a bashful maiden, cloak beneath her long hair the numberless sins of the flesh?.Nothing is visible, and yet all is revealed.		
The result can never be foretold; all this comes to pass in a heaven that never warns; and therefore it is that the tenderest of lovers will often defer to the last hour of all the solemn entry of the great revealer of the depths of our being.... For they too are well aware—the love that is truly love brings the most frivolous back to life’s centre—they too are well aware that all that had gone before was but as children playing outside the gates, and that it is now that the walls are falling and existence lying bare..The others are all watching eagerly around us like little children in front of a marvellous palace..You can play in life as innocently ‘as a child about a deathbed,’ and it is not the tears that are indispensable.		
May it not be at the bedside of the last agony that is woven the veritable and most precious crown of sage and hero, and of all who have known how to live earnestly amid the sorrows, lofty, pure, and discreet, of life according to the soul?.Seeking our sorrows, we shall be the most effectively seeking ourselves, for truly may it be said that the value of ourselves is but the value of our melancholy and our disquiet..It is there in its simplicity, smiling on the threshold of our soul; and those in whom its smiles lie deepest, or shine forth most frequently, may make us suffer day and night and they will, yet shall it be beyond our power to cease to love them....		
And to come nearer to our own time—though Racine may indeed be the unerring poet of the woman’s heart, who would dare to claim for him that he has ever taken one step towards her soul?.We believe we have discovered a grotto that is stored with bewildering treasure; we come back to the light of day, and the gems we have brought are false—mere pieces of glass—and yet does the treasure shine on, unceasingly, in the darkness!.Is it beyond the mark to say that the true tragic element, normal, deeprooted, and universal, that the true tragic element of life only begins at the moment when socalled adventures, sorrows, and dangers have disappeared?		
Does it not seem as though the supreme cry of the soul were at last about to pierce the dense clouds of error that still envelop it in music?.So little!.For one instant has a soul dared to reveal itself, even such as it is in love and sorrow, such as it is in face of death and in the solitude that dwells around the stars of night.		
From that moment, the merest nothing reveals His presence, and the greatness of our life depends on so little!.Then it is no longer necessary that a great king should die for us to remember that ‘the world does not end at the housedoors,’ and not an evening passes but the smallest thing suffices to ennoble the soul..Their abidingplace is at the foot itself of the Inevitable, whose wellworn paths are visible to them more clearly than to us.		
Is it while I flee before a naked sword that my existence touches its most interesting point?.Nay, there are moments when it bears the semblance of an ultimatum; and therefore does it behove us to neglect nothing, but indeed with all eagerness to accept this imperious invitation, that is like unto the dream that is lost for ever, unless instantaneously seized..And if, like Don Juan, we take a thousand and three to our embraces, still shall we find, on that evening when arms fall asunder and lips disunite, that it is always the same woman, good or bad, tender or cruel, loving or faithless, that is standing before us.		
It is possible for you to cause extraordinary tears to flow; it is possible that you may fill a heart with unheard of certitudes, and give eternal life unto a soul, and no one shall know of it, nor shall you even know yourself..At school we were vaguely conscious of them..And the reason must surely be that these things were not so clearly evident then: for at every period there have been men who penetrated to the innermost recesses of life, to its most secret affinities: and all that they learned of the heart, the soul and the spirit of their epoch has been handed down to us.		
What god, that is indeed on the heights, but must smile at our gravest faults, as we smile at the puppies on the hearthrug?.Were they forming a circle round it, and trying to keep it hidden from indifferent eyes?.The sage needs no such violent arousing.		
Which of us, when by the side of the most ordinary person perhaps, but has suddenly become conscious of the advent of something that none had summoned?.Long, slowly falling tears are needed here..Yet has each one of them, when alone, more than once lived in accord with his soul.		
The lowest of men would rather be just than unjust: we all worship, we all pray, numbers of times every day, without knowing it.’ And we are surprised when chance suddenly reveals to us the importance of this divine part..For the soul of man is a guest that has gone hungry these centuries back, and never has it to be summoned twice to the nuptial feast..Wildly pressing down their eyelids, so as not to see that which had to be seen—struggling with all their puny strength against the eternal forces—they will contrive perhaps to cross the road and go towards another, sent thither but not for them.		
If I push open today the door of the house wherein I am to meet the first smiles of a sorrow that shall know no end, I do these things for a longer time than one imagines..What can I learn from creatures who have but one fixed idea, and who have no time to live, for that there is a rival, or a mistress, whom it behoves them to put to death?.I know not.		
Why do they come to us like the bee to the hive, like the dove to the cote; and where do they find a restingplace when we are not there to meet them?.And all that is might well be more mysterious still..Will the day ever dawn when we shall be what we are?...		
In the meanwhile, we felt that they were strangers in our midst..But in what life are there not thousands of hours akin to the hour in that drama where all are waiting for the divine intervention, and none perceive it, till an invisible thought that has flitted across the consciousness of a dying man suddenly reveals itself, and an old man cries out, sobbing for joy and terror, ‘But God, there is God!’.... Must we always be warned, and can we only fall on our knees when some one is there to tell us that God is passing by?.It matters not.		
We are told that in the very temple of love we do but obey the unvarying orders of an invisible throng..They have but obeyed, and even though the saint be deceived and sold by the man he has preferred, still will there abide with him something imperishable, something by which he shall know that he was right and that he has nothing to regret..It would seem, at moments such as these, as though humanity were on the point of struggling from beneath the crushing burden of matter that weighs it down.		
For indeed nothing of beauty can pass by and be altogether unperceived..And even so do we know that this other will sally forth in vain in pursuit of adventure..I have known many whom the same death was leading by the hand, and when my memory dwells upon them I see a band of children, of youths and maidens, who seem to be all coming forth from the same house.		
I am ever standing at the seashore; and, were I Plato, Pascal, or Michael Angelo, and the woman I loved merely telling me of her earrings, the words I would say and the words she would say would appear but the same as they floated on the waves of the fathomless inner sea, that each of us would be contemplating in the other..Our soul will not become earnest and deepsearching, as is the soul of the angels, for that we have, for one fleeting instant, beheld the universe in the shadow of death or eternity, in the radiance of joy or the flames of beauty and love..Which of us—an’ he question himself the side of the light, from which our gaze is habitually averted—which of us but will find in himself the recollection of certain strange workings of this force?		
This is known to nearly all men; but know it though they may, it is only when fortune or death lashes them that they grope around the wall of life in search of the crevices through which God may be seen..That they are ever pressing upon life, unceasingly and with prodigious force—this was unsuspected of all—and the philosopher hastened back to familiar studies of passion, and of incident that floated on the surface..At moments we might believe it to be a recollection, furtive but excessively keen, of the great primitive unity.		
Sophocles indicates the character of his heroes by means of the lightest and quickest of touches..It lives in silence, and the hand of a great judge is ever upon it, though his sentences are beyond our ken..And even when the threshold is crossed, where shall certainty be found?		
Frequently, indeed, will the greatest suffering be caused by those whose love is greatest, for a strange timid, tender cruelty is most often the anxious sister of love..‘Have we,’ asks Claude de SaintMartin, the great ‘unknown philosopher,’ ‘have we advanced one step further on the radiant path of enlightenment, that leads to the simplicity of men?’ Let us wait in silence: perhaps ere long we shall be conscious of ‘the murmur of the gods.’ THE PREDESTINED THE PREDESTINED THEY are known to most men, and there are few mothers who have not seen them..Something there is that we hide from most men, and we ourselves are ignorant of what this thing may be.		
A curious calm steals over us..Indeed, it is not in the actions but in the words that are found the beauty and greatness of tragedies that are truly beautiful and great; and this not solely in the words that accompany and explain the action, for there must perforce be another dialogue besides the one which is superficially necessary..But, readily as we all may feel this, to prove it is by no means easy, inasmuch as this essential tragic element comprises more than that which is merely material or merely psychological.		
On that instant did the soul by the side of you awake on the summits of its being; something sprang to life in regions loftier far than the love of jaded lovers; and for all that the bodies might shrink asunder, henceforth would the souls never forget that for an instant they had beheld each other high above mountains they had never seen, and that for a second’s space they had been good with a goodness they had never known until that day.... What can this be, this mysterious movement that I speak of here in connection with love only, but which may well take place in the smallest events of life?.Othello is admirably jealous..We are told that a thousand centuries divide us from ourselves when we choose the woman we love, and that the first kiss of the betrothed is but the seal that thousands of hands, craving for birth, impress upon the lips of the mother they desire.		
I have caused suffering because we are in a world where all is held together by invisible threads, in a world where none are alone, and where the gentlest gesture of love or kindliness may so often wound the innocence by our side!—I have caused suffering, too, because there are times when the best and tenderest are impelled to seek I know not what part of themselves in the grief of others..For the soul of man is a guest that has gone hungry these centuries back, and never has it to be summoned twice to the nuptial feast..Did we but dread beauty less it would come about that nought else in life would be visible; for in reality it is beauty that underlies everything, it is beauty alone that exists.		
I felt that I had arrived, alone, at that sad zone of kisses when it seems to us that we are visiting the hovels of the poor, while she, who had lingered on the road, was still smiling in the palace of the first days..It is as though men dreaded the contact of their soul, and were anxious to keep its beauty at immeasurable distance..One might almost believe that there exists, somewhere, a place where all is weighed in the presence of the spirits, or perhaps, out yonder, the other side of the night, a reservoir of certitudes whither the silent herd of souls flock every morning to slake their thirst.		
It means that each day will reveal to us a new beauty in that mysterious angel, and that we shall walk together in a goodness that shall ever become more and more living, loftier and loftier..It cannot forgive, for forgiveness here were but the denial of itself..Do you not think it would be more akin to the discourse that would naturally be held between two souls?		
Loving thus, we can no longer have anything to conceal, for that the everpresent soul transforms all things into beauty..Why not dare to be the one to "begin.".Thus, he continued, I have caused suffering because I loved, and also have I caused suffering because I did not lovebut how great was the difference in the two cases!		
Needs must one god beckon to another, and no signal is so imperceptible but they will every one of them respond..Can the beauty not exist that is not understood, and is there not in every man something that does understandin regions far beyond what he seems to understand, far beyond, too, what he believes he understands?.It means that the least gesture will call forth the presence of the soul with all its treasure.		
Does not evil itself become precious so soon as it has gathered therefrom the deep lying diamond of repentance?.I said just now that the soul changed into beauty the little things we gave to it..But it matters not; we have learned that nothing can be lost in the soul, and that even to the very pettiest there come moments of splendor.		
This is brought home to us at every moment of our life, and is no less evident to the man by whom beauty may more than once have been denied than to him who is ever seeking it in his heart..Would you go to him whose shake of the head had sullied a generous action or a mere impulse that was pure?.It requires more effort to fall, perhaps, than to rise.		
And yet will you have rendered no assistance to the untiring queen; other thoughts will have filled your mind, and it will be without your knowledge that the act will have been purified in the silence of your being, and will have flown into the precious waters that lie in the great reservoir of truth and beauty, which, unlike the shallower reservoir of true or beautiful thoughts, has an ever unruffled surface, and remains for all time out of reach of the breath of life..They will see it and their greeting to you will be very different than had you been meditating how best to deceive your brother..Its nature changes from the moment that it manifests itself by means of an exterior act; and we are no longer in the truth according to the soul, but in a kind of falsehood as conceived by man.		
Nothing responds more infallibly to the secret cry of goodness than the secret cry of goodness that is near..Grief is love's first food, and every love that has not been fed on a little pure suffering must die like the babe that one had tried to nourish on the nourishment of a man..And if our eyes bring it nothing, still will it know how to turn its pitiful disillusion into something ineffable, that it will conceal even till its death.		
They themselves had been the first to be beautiful, and had therefore attracted all the beauty that passed by, as a lighthouse attracts the vessels from the four corners of the horizon..Is it all that is admirable and sorrowful in the mere act of living that, at such moments, floods our beingis it the aspect of life, one and indivisible?.And yet does it not reveal itself to the eyes of the body.		
Loving thus, we have no longer even the need to forgive..Even he who rejects your word will, in spite of himself, have taken a step towards the beauty that is within him..But one day, peradventure, the word comes up again extraordinarily transformed, and revealing the unexpected fruit it has borne in the darkness; then silence once more falls over all.		
If we could but probe to the root of things it might well be discovered that it is by the strength of some souls that are beautiful that others are sustained in life..If you have never in your life felt the power of your invisible goodness, go no further; it would be useless..These men had "begun."		
Do you imagine it would pass quite unnoticed or merely arouse surprise?.Bear it in mind, however, that here we are on the mountains, where not to know oneself means far more than mere ignorance of what takes place within us at moments of jealousy or love, fear or envy, happiness or unhappiness..It cannot be said too often that, be the crevice never so small, it will yet suffice for all the waters of heaven to pour into our soul.		
Loving thus, we perceive truth in happiness as profoundly as some of the heroes perceived it in the radiance of greatest sorrow..We know now that another love had sprung to life, a love that demands not the words, the little attentions and smiles of ordinary love..I have for a long time followed that man's life, and have seen the inexplicable power he exercised over the most obscure, the most unapproachable, the blindest, even the most rebellious of souls.		
And would it not be in accordance with the primal truth if all men were to feel that they were face to face with each other, even as the woman feels with the man she loves?.Resignedly does it labor, its whole life long, in the darkness whither most of us relegate it, where it is spoken to by none..But if the door open not (and how many lives are there wherein it does open?)		
But in this idea how much is there of the soul that is chosen, how much of him who chooses?.It is there in its simplicity, smiling on the threshold of our soul; and those in whom its smiles lies deepest, or shine forth most frequently, may make us suffer day and night and they will, yet shall it be beyond our power to cease to love them.....There are within us lives in which we love unconsciously.		
e. divineconcludes thus: "As regards ourselves, we are beautiful when we belong to ourselves, and ugly when we lower ourselves to our inferior nature..And yet with the generality of men, ingenuity, strength and skill do but imply that the soul must first of all be banished from their life, and that every impulse that lies too deep must be carefully brushed aside.."Even to the very wretchedest of all," said to me one day the loftiest minded creature it has ever been my happiness to know, "even to the very wretchedest of all I never have the courage to say anything in reply that is ugly or mediocre."		
We are surprised when certain men tell us that they have never come across real ugliness, that they cannot conceive that a soul can be base..But are there really any who have not felt this power, and have the worst of us never been invisibly good?.Wherefore you will do well to think it over, for none are alone, and those who are good must watch.		
"Much is to learn, much to forget,        Through worlds I shall traverse not a few.".It is no law of our making, and I know not whether I would dare to love the man who had made no one weep..At moments we might believe it to be a recollection, furtive, but excessively keen, of the great primitive unity.		
Some there are who do thus in beauty love each other..There is no soul but is conscious of this, none that is not in readiness; but where are those that hide not their beauty?.The souls of all our brethren are ever hovering about us, craving for a caress, and only waiting for the signal.		
Even though perhaps you had been of those who commended him, you would none the less, when it was truth that knocked at your door, turn to the man who had known how to prostrate himself and love..There, never complaining, does it do all that in its power lies, striving to tear from out the pebbles we fling to it the nucleus of eternal light that peradventure they contain..We see nothing but bucklers and helmets, we touch nothing but iron and brass.		
Hide as it may, let it but raise its head, move a link of its chain or open its hand, and the prison is illumined, the pressure of radiance from within bursts open the iron barrier, and then, suddenly, there yawns a gulf between words and beings, a gulf peopled with agitated angels; silence falls over all: the eyes turn away for a moment and two souls embrace tearfully on the threshold....."For my part," said a sage to me one day, "I have never come across a single woman who did not bring to me something that was great.".But there are those who complain of women, for instance, never dreaming that, the first time a man meets a woman, a single word or thought that denies the beautiful or profound will be enough to poison for ever his existence in her soul.		
While you are actively good in the invisible, all those who approach you will unconsciously do things that they could not do by the side of any other man..As we wander from the gods within us so does ugliness enwrap us; as we discover them, so do we become more beautiful..No longer is there need of death, disaster or tears for that the soul shall appear; a smile suffices.		
Whereas, on the contrary, we should endeavor to move in advance of ourselves..And yet in the domain where we are everything is effective, for that everything is waiting..To love thus means more than to have pity, to make inner sacrifices, to be anxious to help and give happiness; it is a thing that lies a thousand fathoms deeper, where our softest, swiftest, strongest words cannot reach it.		
Ah!.This was brought home to me that evening..We are afraid of everything that cannot be explained by word or gesture; and we shut our eyes to all that we do, ourselves notwithstanding, in the empire where explanations are vain!		
And yet what is needed to become the grownup person for whom they lie in wait?.It is unmistakably borne home to us that even the unhappiest and the most destitute of men have at the depths of their being and in spite of themselves a treasure of beauty that they cannot despoil..Why are we so fearful lest we exhaust the heaven within us?		
And to love thus means that, little by little, the sense of ugliness is lost; that one's eyes are closed to all the littlenesses of life, to all but the freshness and virginity of the very humblest of souls..Then why keep back a lofty, beautiful word, for that you doubt whether others will understand?.Might not everything naturally turn into beauty, were we not unceasingly interrupting the arduous labors of our soul?		
When we raise our eyes it yearns for a ray of sun or star, that it may weave into a thought, or, haply, an impulse, which shall be unconscious and very pure..The soul is not exacting..And yet it is possible that nothing is changing in the life one sees; but is it only that which matters, and is our existence indeed confined to actions we can take in our hand like stones on the highroad?
