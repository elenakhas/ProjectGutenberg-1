now	your	help	may	be	very	valuable	to	me	tell	me	on	monday	not	tuesday	dorcas	but	monday	the	day	before	the	tragedy	did	anything	go	wrong	with	mrs.	inglethorp	’s	bell	dorcas	looked	very	surprised	we	are	face	to	face	with	an	entirely	new	problem		
i	guarded	her	from	the	lot	of	them	and	then	a	glibtongued	scoundrel	comes	along	and	pooh!.mesdames	and	messieurs	said	poirot	bowing	as	though	he	were	a	celebrity	about	to	deliver	a	lecture	i	have	asked	you	to	come	here	all	together	for	a	certain	object	sir	ernest	heavywether	who	was	famous	all	over	england	for	the	unscrupulous	manner	in	which	he	bullied	witnesses	only	asked	two	questions		
i	mean	explained	poirot	you	are	sure	it	was	bolted	and	not	merely	locked	oh	i	see	what	you	mean	we	shall	be	pinched	at	first	of	course	because	as	i	once	told	you	i	am	in	a	bit	of	a	hole	financially	myself	still	the	johnnies	will	wait	now	in	the	general	relief	at	inglethorp	’s	approaching	departure	we	had	the	most	genial	breakfast	we	had	experienced	since	the	tragedy		
yet	that	is	what	it	looks	like	poirot	nodded	reflectively	i	told	him	what	was	true	that	i	liked	him	very	much	that	i	hoped	to	come	to	like	him	more	but	that	i	was	not	in	any	way	what	the	world	calls	in	love’	with	him	what	do	you	think	of	that	i	scrutinized	the	fragment		
and	that	little	curious	fact	that	possibly	paltry	little	detail	that	will	not	tally	we	put	it	here	he	made	an	extravagant	gesture	with	his	hand	my	evening	was	utterly	and	entirely	spoilt	by	the	presence	of	dr.	bauerstein	i	met	him	john	flung	the	match	into	an	adjacent	flower	bed	a	proceeding	which	was	too	much	for	poirot	’s	feelings		
and	you	remember	nothing	at	all?.he	stretched	out	his	hands	the	spacing	of	the	plants	also	is	perfect		
i	must	say——	but	i	stopped	suddenly	i	glanced	sideways	at	him	all	the	doors	had	been	bolted	on	the	inside		
she	was	able	to	speak	in	short	gasps	then	came	the	sensation	of	the	day	if	i	’m	not	greatly	mistaken	he	’s	got	something	up	his	sleeve		
i	shall	go	round	the	long	way	through	the	woods	the	woods	round	styles	were	very	beautiful	but	at	lunchtime	there	arrived	a	new	piece	of	evidence	or	rather	lack	of	evidence	he	seemed	somewhat	apathetic	in	the	search	as	though	he	expected	no	great	results	from	it		
one	was	to	miss	howard	and	one	was	to	mr.	wells	the	lawyer	and	the	other	two	i	do	n’t	think	i	remember	sir	oh	yes	one	was	to	ross	’s	the	caterers	in	tadminster	do	you	understand	now	monsieur	no	started	the	moment	i	got	the	wire		
i	rather	resented	his	not	taking	me	into	his	confidence	the	more	so	as	i	could	not	in	the	least	guess	what	he	was	driving	at	most	comic!.i	remained	by	the	door	fearing	to	obliterate	any	clues		
she	nodded	i	will	put	down	my	little	case	until	i	need	it	he	did	so	on	the	round	table	by	the	window	but	it	was	an	illadvised	proceeding	for	the	top	of	it	being	loose	it	tilted	up	and	precipitated	the	despatchcase	on	the	floor	she	could	not	be	implicated	otherwise	i	should	have	heard	some	hint	of	it		
of	the	intervening	weeks	i	will	say	little	but	my	admiration	and	sympathy	went	out	unfeignedly	to	mary	cavendish	miss	howard	i	explained	this	employment	requires	precision	of	the	fingers		
she	was	very	generous	but	she	always	wanted	a	return	she	was	very	pale	but	smiling	listen	and	i	then	told	him	of	the	cocoa	sample	which	poirot	had	taken	to	be	analysed		
i	am	sorry	for	that	he	said	there	was	the	faintest	pause	the	mere	hesitation	of	a	moment	before	she	answered	yes	that	is	so	and	the	boudoir	window	was	open	was	it	not	surely	her	face	grew	a	little	paler	as	she	answered	yes	then	you	can	not	have	failed	to	hear	the	voices	inside	especially	as	they	were	raised	in	anger	everything	matters	i	know		
is	n’t	he	coming	back	today	i	do	n’t	know	poor	dear	lady	poirot	switched	off	on	another	tack		
it	was	really	almost	like	a	conjuring	trick	well	my	friend	you	have	seen	the	fingermarks	it	remains	to	tell	you	the	particular	object	on	which	they	had	been	left	go	on	i	am	really	excited	eh	bien	photo	no	now	inglethorp	’s	out	of	the	way	there	’s	no	one	else	no	one	i	mean	except	one	of	us	yes	indeed	that	was	nightmare	enough	for	any	man		
is	it	not	customary	for	anyone	purchasing	poison	to	sign	a	book	yes	sir	mr.	inglethorp	did	so	have	you	got	the	book	here	yes	sir	it	was	produced	and	with	a	few	words	of	stern	censure	the	coroner	dismissed	the	wretched	mr.	mace	i	believe	i	’ve	only	seen	your	hand	shake	once	on	an	occasion	when	i	was	enraged	without	doubt	observed	poirot	with	great	placidity	dr	bauerstein	i	had	had	no	opportunity	as	yet	of	passing	on	poirot	’s	message	to	lawrence		
she	was	an	old	lady	and	might	possibly	have	forgotten	the	former	one	or	this	seemed	to	him	more	likely	she	may	have	had	an	idea	that	it	was	revoked	by	her	marriage	as	there	had	been	some	conversation	on	the	subject	surely	the	whole	thing	is	clear	as	daylight	and	little	cynthia		
yes	a	good	deal	that	was	peculiar	came	out	today	continued	poirot	i	shall	never	forget	the	night	he	came	down	as	the	char	of	persia	i	think	he	called	it	a	sort	of	eastern	king	it	was	is	it	possible	that	she	could	have	swallowed	the	poison	by	accident	asked	the	coroner		
i	understand	continued	the	coroner	deliberately	that	you	were	sitting	reading	on	the	bench	just	outside	the	long	window	of	the	boudoir	an	expression	gathered	there	that	i	can	only	describe	as	half	puzzled	and	half	relieved	further	questioned	he	described	his	awakening	in	the	early	hours	of	the	morning	and	the	circumstances	of	his	mother	’s	death		
the	coroner	however	passed	briskly	to	the	next	point	and	poirot	drew	a	deep	breath	of	relief	screaming	headlines	in	every	paper	in	the	country	damn	all	journalists	i	say!.i	was	not	surprised		
i	have	drawn	certain	conclusions	yes	summerhaye	was	still	looking	rather	sceptical	but	japp	continued	his	scrutiny	of	poirot	there	was	therefore	no	means	of	destroying	a	thick	document	such	as	a	will	mary”—his	voice	was	very	quiet	now	are	you	in	love	with	this	fellow	bauerstein	she	hesitated	and	suddenly	there	swept	across	her	face	a	strange	expression	old	as	the	hills	yet	with	something	eternally	young	about	it		
he	held	his	cap	in	his	hands	twisting	it	very	carefully	round	and	round	it	seems	incredible	that	a	woman	like	mrs.	cavendish	proud	and	reticent	to	the	last	degree	should	interfere	so	violently	in	what	was	certainly	not	her	affair	precisely	cavendish	and	mademoiselle	cynthia	yes	that	is	so	i	felt	an	inexpressible	lightening	of	the	heart		
i	ca	n’t	feel	as	you	do	lawrence	he	said	at	last	oh	clever	as	the	devil!.i	would	like	to	ask	you	one	question		
he	has	lived	by	his	wits	as	the	saying	goes	but	lawrence	never	speaks	to	me	if	he	can	help	it	and	mary	can	hardly	bring	herself	to	be	civil	to	me	but	the	flesh	is	weak	it	is	consolation	to	find	that	one	is	on	the	right	track		
was	this	the	monstrous	possibility	that	evelyn	had	tried	not	to	believe?.good	heavens	poirot	i	cried	don’t	you	understand		
poirot	smiled	had	mrs.	inglethorp	discovered	something	between	her	and	bauerstein	and	threatened	to	tell	her	husband?.she	stepped	out	with	head	erect	the	sun	flashing	on	the	silver	threads	in	her	hair		
can	you	suggest	any	explanation?".for	a	moment	the	magistrate	hesitated	baffled	perhaps	you	remember		
it	is	heartrending	to	see	her	françoise	was	there	she	knew	that	she	had	committed	a	grave	fault	in	not	denouncing	conneau	to	the	law	but	she	declared	in	a	broken	voice	that	that	was	a	thing	no	woman	could	have	done
