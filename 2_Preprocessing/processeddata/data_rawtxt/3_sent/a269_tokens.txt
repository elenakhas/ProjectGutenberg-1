fancy	bumpo	studying	at	oxford	well	well	there	were	great	doings	in	jolliginki	when	he	left	that	fellow	has	had	enough	to	last	any	man	for	three	days	i	found	them	in	your	cabin	hiding	under	the	bunk		
going	to	be	a	nice	day	do	n’t	you	think?.for	you	see	lots	of	the	animals	hardly	talk	at	all	with	their	tongues	they	use	their	breath	or	their	tails	or	their	feet	instead	i	wanted	him	to	come	with	me	here	to	see	you	but	he	wo	n’t	leave	the	prison	while	luke	is	there		
the	streets	were	all	twisty	and	winding	and	so	narrow	that	a	wagon	could	only	just	pass	along	them	let	me	give	you	another	cup	of	tea	the	eighth	chapter	are	you	a	good	noticer?.oh	rubbish	said	the	doctor		
we	will	have	to	look	into	this	tomorrow	but	jip	it	was	who	scratching	at	the	foot	of	the	slab	like	a	good	ratter	made	the	discovery	which	led	to	our	final	success	if	such	a	thing	befall	me	all	the	great	work	i	hoped	to	do	must	go	undone	for	who	is	there	unfreer	than	a	king		
ah	well	it	will	be	discovered	again	some	day	by	somebody	else	the	crowd	had	forgotten	them	entirely	all	the	people	were	laughing	and	calling	and	waving	to	luke	to	show	him	how	glad	they	were	that	he	was	free		
at	a	word	from	the	doctor	cheechee	and	polynesia	sped	off	into	the	jungles	after	more	fruit	and	water	what	time	is	it	now	it	’s	ten	minutes	past	one	bob	says	he	thinks	they	are	going	to	kill	luke	for	a	punishment	if	they	can	prove	that	he	did	it	or	certainly	keep	him	in	prison	for	the	rest	of	his	life	but	far	too	light	and	too	small	we	made	but	a	poor	exchange		
one	peculiar	thing	i	noticed	immediately	i	came	into	it	and	that	was	what	a	lot	of	birds	there	were	about	over	the	lawns	hung	weepingwillows	and	their	feathery	boughtips	brushed	the	velvet	grass	when	they	swung	with	the	wind	and	when	you	’ve	finished	go	and	get	your	threethousand	pesetas	out	of	don	rickyticky		
she	says	he	is	a	perfectly	marvelous	naturalist	quick	bring	his	bacon	back	on	to	the	table	the	ninth	chapter	the	garden	of	dreams	when	breakfast	was	over	the	doctor	took	me	out	to	show	me	the	garden	the	sixth	chapter	the	jabizri	we	found	the	woods	at	the	feet	of	the	hills	thick	and	tangly	and	somewhat	hard	to	get	through		
joe	said	he	would	sell	her	to	us	cheap	i’ve	forgotten	more	about	the	sea	than	that	lumbering	lout	will	ever	know	he	was	a	very	peculiar	person		
you	’d	think	that	any	one	after	being	told	he	was	n’t	wanted	would	have	had	the	decency	to	keep	quiet	every	animal	in	this	zoo	stays	here	because	he	likes	it	not	because	he	is	made	to	they	all	look	very	happy	and	clean	i	said	standing	right	near	the	gangplank	were	my	mother	and	father		
he	and	the	doctor	between	them	managed	to	make	themselves	understood	to	the	bagjagderags	it	made	a	hollow	booming	sound	like	a	giant	drum	but	it	was	only	when	i	at	last	got	a	glimpse	of	the	face	under	the	hat	that	i	could	be	really	sure	it	was	a	monkey		
bumpo	please	go	downstairs	to	my	bunk	and	listen	in	the	pocket	of	my	dressinggown	you	’ll	find	some	maps	do	you	think	you	could	get	me	some	why	certainly	said	the	porpoises	we	passed	one	herd	of	them	out	there	sporting	about	among	the	icebergs	and	yet	the	petrel	was	alone!—what	a	baby	i	was	i	told	myself	to	be	scared	to	the	verge	of	tears	just	by	loneliness		
and	in	a	deep	cave	in	the	mountains	i	heard	them	arrange	together	to	kill	luke	the	hermit	so	that	they	should	get	all	the	gold	and	he	have	none	at	this	point	the	judge	asked	where	is	the	witness	mendoza?.hasn’t	arrived	yet	of	course	well	we	finally	agreed	and	as	our	good	friend	had	no	spare	bedrooms	the	three	of	us	the	doctor	bumpo	and	i	slept	on	the	beds	set	out	for	sale	on	the	pavement	before	the	shop		
they	threw	up	their	hands	in	horror	when	they	saw	us	if	you	can	satisfy	us	that	you	really	are	able	to	understand	canine	testimony	the	dog	shall	be	admitted	as	a	witness	i	am	waiting	to	see	the	sun	rise		
poor	perishing	heathens	muttered	bumpo	he	waved	his	hand	and	lo!.as	i	climbed	into	the	bunk	over	the	doctor	’s	and	pulled	the	blankets	snugly	round	me	i	found	i	could	look	out	of	the	porthole	at	my	elbow	and	without	raising	my	head	from	the	pillow	could	see	the	lights	of	penzance	swinging	gently	up	and	down	with	the	motion	of	the	ship	at	anchor		
but	i	’d	sooner	swim	back	to	puddleby	than	have	to	listen	to	that	fellow	’s	talk	all	the	way	to	brazil	indeed	he	was	a	terrible	person	this	ben	butcher	come	here	jip	said	the	doctor	in	a	stern	voice	this	is	a	great	piece	of	luck	the	second	chapter	the	fidgit	’s	story	well	now	that	he	was	started	once	more	upon	his	old	hobby	of	the	shellfish	languages	there	was	no	stopping	the	doctor		
but	it	looked	very	splendid	well	i	thought	i	was	going	to	have	a	perfectly	grand	time	i	can	do	nothing		
could	n’t	we	make	some	arrangement	couldn’t	i	work	for	my	meals	and	sleep	here	but	my	dear	stubbins	said	the	doctor	laughing	you	are	quite	welcome	to	come	here	for	three	meals	a	day	all	the	year	round	of	course	i	could	not	understand	everything	that	was	going	on	though	it	was	all	very	interesting	when	we	reached	the	ship	’s	side	the	doctor	had	the	anchor	drawn	up	and	the	sails	set	and	everything	in	readiness	to	get	away		
he	turned	back	pleadingly	again	to	long	arrow	in	a	last	appeal	for	help	and	the	people	especially	the	spanish	ladies	think	no	end	of	them	he’ll	set	the	dog	on	you	nevertheless	there	were	two	people	who	often	went	out	to	that	little	shack	on	the	fens	the	doctor	and	myself		
myself	i	think	it	was	an	albino	niggeress	at	last	i	got	tired	and	lay	down	to	rest	so	we	did	n’t	bother	to	unload	our	rowboat	but	just	tied	it	on	to	the	ship	’s	stern	with	a	rope	and	jumped	aboard		
so	i	pulled	the	dish	a	little	further	away	from	the	fire	and	went	on	through	the	house	looking	for	the	doctor	don’t	take	any	notice	of	that	stupid	old	salt	you	see	i	’ve	never	been	to	school		
i	and	    	my	sister	clippa	she	was	my	favorite	sister	had	a	    	very	narrow	escape	for	our	lives	with	this	part	of	the	business	over	the	doctor	called	to	polynesia	to	have	the	black	parrots	drive	the	enemy	right	back	into	their	own	country	and	to	wait	there	guarding	them	all	night	probably	his	home	is	near	here	and	that	’s	why	he	’s	come	back	but	why	i	asked	did	he	go	the	whole	way	round	the	mountain	first	then	the	three	of	us	got	into	a	violent	argument		
the	gales	round	here	are	fierce	when	they	do	blow	tear	your	canvas	out	like	paper	with	a	deep	reverence	the	bearers	motioned	towards	the	seat	of	the	chair	inviting	the	white	man	to	get	in	the	moment	that	ben	is	seated	at	the	diningtable	bumpo	slams	the	door	and	locks	it		
for	she	had	gone	on	a	voyage	with	him	to	that	country	long	ago	it	’s	this	hanging	around	almost	dead	still	that	gets	me	restless	ah	here	comes	a	wind	not	very	strong	but	maybe	it	’ll	grow	a	gentle	breeze	from	the	northeast	came	singing	through	the	ropes	and	we	smiled	up	hopefully	at	the	curlew	’s	leaning	masts	now	if	we	were	in	africa	the	world	would	be	blazing	with	sunlight	at	this	hour	of	the	morning		
you	may	    	be	sure	though	that	we	took	a	couple	of	good	gulps	    	of	air	while	they	were	n’t	looking	and	that	was	the	    	only	thing	that	saved	us	from	choking	and	in	two	seconds	the	gallant	assistant	was	nowhere	to	be	seen	i	go	to	don	enrique	and	say	i	bet	you	a	hundred	pounds	the	doctor	wins.’	then	if	he	does	win	don	enrique	pays	me	a	hundred	pounds	and	if	he	does	n’t	i	have	to	pay	don	enrique	that	’s	the	idea	said	polynesia		
our	house	was	surrounded	by	the	whole	population	of	popsipetel	it	seems	that	long	arrow	was	visiting	some	peculiar	indians	that	live	there	and	that	when	last	seen	he	was	going	up	into	the	mountains	looking	for	rare	medicineplants	even	had	i	not	gone	with	you	i	intended	at	the	end	of	this	term	to	take	a	threemonths’	absconsion	but	besides	i	shall	not	be	neglecting	my	edification	if	i	accompany	you		
oh	kindly	one	we	are	bidden	by	the	united	voices	of	the	peoples	of	this	land	to	carry	you	to	the	whispering	rocks	that	there	with	all	respect	and	majesty	you	may	be	crowned	our	king	king	of	all	the	moving	land	the	good	indians	did	not	seem	to	have	even	considered	the	possibility	of	john	dolittle	’s	refusing	the	very	palms	    	bowed	down	their	heads	    	in	welcome	to	the	coming	king	they	may	have	very	good	eyesight	and	all	that	but	when	you	ask	them	to	find	a	man	for	you	they	ca	n’t	do	it	and	they	have	the	cheek	to	come	back	and	say	that	nobody	else	could	do	it		
the	beds	downstairs	are	made	of	primrose	silk	with	hundreds	of	big	pillows	and	cushions	there	are	thick	soft	carpets	on	the	floors	the	dishes	are	made	of	silver	and	there	are	all	sorts	of	good	things	to	eat	and	drink	special	things	the	larder	well	it	’s	just	like	a	shop	that	’s	all	now	as	they	were	getting	off	the	doctor	noticed	that	a	whole	lot	of	rats	were	coming	up	from	downstairs	and	leaving	the	ship	as	well	and	i	have	told	all	the	other	hunting	animals	to	come	and	do	their	share		
this	morning	at	six	o’clock	while	i	was	getting	breakfast	my	tail	suddenly	began	to	tingle	doctor	they	cried	the	pirates	have	come	into	the	bay	and	they	’ve	all	got	on	to	your	ship	but	after	he	had	dug	holes	in	the	ground	to	get	the	gold	and	killed	all	the	elephants	to	get	their	ivory	tusks	he	went	away	secretly	in	his	ship—	without	so	much	as	saying	thank	you.’	never	again	shall	a	white	man	travel	through	the	lands	of	jolliginki	illustration	and	queen	ermintrude	was	asleep	then	the	king	turned	to	some	of	the	black	men	who	were	standing	near	and	said	take	away	this	medicineman	with	all	his	animals	and	lock	them	up	in	my	strongest	prison	so	six	of	the	black	men	led	the	doctor	and	all	his	pets	away	and	shut	them	up	in	a	stone	dungeon		
let	’s	go	down	to	supper	the	prince	was	away	fishing	for	salmon	in	the	river	he	eats	the	linoleum		
when	did	you	see	him	last	it	was	the	day	before	yesterday	said	the	boy	’tis	true	indeed	that	she	awoke	and	he	told	all	the	animals	to	get	out	too	and	romp	on	the	grass	to	stretch	their	legs		
he	has	n’t	taken	a	thing	since	last	night	and	she	began	to	cry	and	shake	with	nervousness	for	she	was	a	good	mother	even	though	she	was	a	lioness	be	pleasant	till	the	ship	sinks	under	him	soon	the	front	end	of	the	ship	began	to	go	down	and	down	faster	and	faster	till	the	boat	looked	almost	as	though	it	were	standing	on	its	head	and	the	pirates	had	to	cling	to	the	rails	and	the	masts	and	the	ropes	and	anything	to	keep	from	sliding	off		
but	i	’m	afraid	we	have	n’t	money	enough	to	buy	the	tickets	we	shall	be	poorer	than	ever	when	we	get	back	and	we	borrowed	a	boat	from	a	sailor	but	it	was	broken	on	the	rocks	when	we	reached	the	shores	of	africa		
i	wonder	if	you	could	train	me	to	smell	as	well	as	that	do	you	remember	how	she	got	us	all	out	of	prison	the	second	time?.perhaps	we	can	find	him	for	you		
they	are	surely	the	pirates	of	barbary	well	we	must	put	up	more	sails	on	our	boat	said	the	doctor	so	we	can	go	faster	and	get	away	from	them	the	vet	’s	looking	after	him	now	what	’s	the	matter	with	the	dog		
the	smell	makes	me	giddy	the	little	boy	seemed	rather	frightened	to	find	a	man	standing	there	before	him	and	all	those	animals	staring	in	through	the	hole	in	the	broken	door	then	they	sent	a	message	down	to	the	doctor	to	say	that	they	would	have	to	take	a	rest	soon	and	that	they	would	pull	the	boat	over	to	an	island	not	far	off	and	hide	it	in	a	deep	bay	till	they	had	got	breath	enough	to	go	on	but	the	pig	and	the	dog	and	the	owl	tootoo	could	do	nothing	in	such	weather	but	sat	at	the	end	of	the	ship	in	the	shade	of	a	big	barrel	with	their	tongues	hanging	out	drinking	lemonade		
at	night	she	carried	a	tiny	lantern	so	they	should	not	miss	her	in	the	dark	and	the	people	on	the	other	ships	that	passed	said	that	the	light	must	be	a	shooting	star	and	the	doctor	with	all	his	animals	ran	as	fast	as	they	could	down	to	the	seashore	while	bumpo	leaned	against	the	wall	of	the	empty	dungeon	smiling	after	them	happily	his	big	face	shining	like	polished	ivory	in	the	light	of	the	moon	but	you	spent	it	on	a	rattle	for	that	badger	’s	baby	when	he	was	teething	did	i	said	the	doctor	dear	me	dear	me		
you	were	going	to	run	off	in	my	ship	eh?.the	man	’s	as	good	as	found	so	the	doctor	told	cheechee	to	pull	up	the	anchor	and	the	voyage	began		
well	that	’s	just	like	her!—sneaked	off	into	the	jungle	as	soon	as	her	friends	got	into	trouble	i	’m	not	that	kind	of	a	bird	said	the	parrot	climbing	out	of	the	pocket	in	the	tail	of	the	doctor	’s	coat	the	king	of	the	jolliginki	thought	it	would	be	easy	for	his	army	to	find	them	because	the	doctor	was	in	a	strange	land	and	would	not	know	his	way	my	gracious	said	gubgub	in	a	hushed	voice		
let	them	swim	safely	to	the	land	the	sixteenth	chapter	tootoo	the	listener	having	thanked	the	sharks	again	for	their	kindness	the	doctor	and	his	pets	set	off	once	more	on	their	journey	home	in	the	swift	ship	with	the	three	red	sails	hot	water	smells	quite	different	from	cold	water	there	were	so	many	of	them	that	he	had	to	send	some	away	and	only	kept	the	cleverest		
let	us	go	upstairs	and	see	which	way	the	wind	is	blowing	but	it	is	dark	now	said	the	doctor	and	soon	it	became	a	common	sight	to	see	farmanimals	wearing	glasses	in	the	country	round	puddleby	and	a	blind	horse	was	a	thing	unknown	that	’s	very	interesting		
very	considerate	of	you	very!.your	coat	looks	as	though	it	needed	brushing	badly	and	if	you	do	n’t	help	the	other	animals	now	the	lions	may	find	themselves	left	all	alone	when	they	are	in	trouble		
but	it	was	no	use	after	i	have	gone	remember	never	to	let	the	flies	settle	on	your	food	before	you	eat	it	and	do	not	sleep	on	the	ground	when	the	rains	are	coming	cheechee	and	polynesia	watched	him	keeping	very	quiet	and	still		
and	as	he	sprang	forward	to	take	hold	of	the	doctor	one	of	his	ears	caught	fast	in	a	tree	and	the	rest	of	the	army	had	to	stop	and	help	him	‘i’ve	got	it!’	as	soon	as	jip	awoke	he	ran	upstairs	and	poked	his	nose	in	the	air	perhaps	if	we	make	him	a	new	house	and	a	bigger	bed	and	promise	him	plenty	of	monkeyservants	to	work	for	him	and	to	make	life	pleasant	for	him	perhaps	then	he	will	not	wish	to	go	then	cheechee	got	up	and	all	the	others	whispered	sh		
now	we	shall	be	ruined	entirely	the	cat’smeatman	was	there	to	see	them	off	and	he	brought	a	large	suetpudding	as	a	present	for	the	doctor	because	he	said	he	had	been	told	you	could	n’t	get	suetpuddings	in	foreign	parts	have	you	forgotten	that	you	are	talking	to	john	dolittle	m.d	the	most	wonderful	man	on	earth		
and	one	of	them	said	to	ben	ali	but	surely	if	this	old	boat	were	sinking	we	should	see	the	rats	leaving	it	and	jip	shouted	across	from	the	other	ship	you	great	duffers	there	are	no	rats	there	to	leave!.for	though	i	may	not	be	able	to	sail	a	ship	as	well	as	you	so	long	as	the	birds	and	the	beasts	and	the	fishes	are	my	friends	i	do	not	have	to	be	afraid	of	a	pirate	chief	even	though	he	call	himself	the	dragon	of	barbary.’	now	go	and	be	a	good	farmer	and	live	in	peace	then	the	doctor	turned	to	the	big	shark	and	waving	his	hand	he	said	all	right	doctor		
but	snuff!—tut	tut	does	hot	water	have	a	smell	asked	the	doctor	but	it	is	n’t	so	easy	to	turn	a	black	man	white	don’t	fuss		
and	the	pushmipullyu	took	the	little	boy	on	his	back	and	gave	him	a	ride	round	the	diningroom	table	while	all	the	other	animals	followed	behind	beating	the	dishcovers	with	spoons	pretending	it	was	a	parade	we	lost	our	way	in	the	jungle	and	blundered	into	the	palacegarden	by	mistake	but	could	n’t	you	guide	them	asked	cheechee	and	he	began	to	scold	the	parrot	for	letting	them	get	lost	while	he	was	away	looking	for	the	cocoanuts	with	all	these	mouths	to	fill	and	the	house	to	look	after	and	no	one	to	do	the	mending	and	no	money	coming	in	to	pay	the	butcher	’s	bill	things	began	to	look	very	difficult		
then	the	doctor	’s	work	was	done	and	he	was	so	tired	he	went	to	bed	and	slept	for	three	days	without	even	turning	over	and	the	doctor	said	i	shall	only	be	able	to	take	you	three	with	jip	the	dog	dabdab	the	duck	gubgub	the	pig	and	the	owl	tootoo	they	always	had	plenty	to	eat	and	drink	because	cheechee	and	polynesia	knew	all	the	different	kinds	of	fruits	and	vegetables	that	grow	in	the	jungle	and	where	to	find	them	like	dates	and	figs	and	groundnuts	and	ginger	and	yams		
and	soon	a	whole	school	came	dancing	and	jumping	through	the	water	on	their	way	to	brazil	now	the	doctor	says	he	must	go	back	and	get	the	sailor	another	boat	because	the	man	was	poor	and	his	ship	was	all	he	had	and	the	monkeys	were	all	silent	for	a	while	sitting	quite	still	upon	the	ground	and	thinking	hard	but	the	big	monkey	who	was	carrying	the	pig	dropped	him	on	the	ground	and	cried	out	to	the	other	monkeys	boys	a	bridge		
that	’s	what	you	call	a	stowaway,’	said	the	parrot	all	the	animals	from	here	to	the	indian	ocean	are	talking	about	this	wonderful	man	and	how	he	can	cure	any	kind	of	sickness	and	how	kind	he	is	the	only	man	in	the	whole	world	who	can	talk	the	language	of	the	animals!.but	the	doctor	asked	him	not	to	make	so	much	noise	about	it	and	when	he	had	closed	his	medicinebag	in	a	hurry	he	told	him	to	open	the	prisondoor		
the	sides	are	n’t	strong	enough	at	first	i	thought	it	was	my	rheumatism	coming	back	well	make	sure	said	polynesia
