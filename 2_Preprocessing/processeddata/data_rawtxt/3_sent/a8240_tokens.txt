he	threw	his	bag	over	and	began	shinnying	up	and	while	he	was	trying	to	cash	the	check	she	gave	him	she	visited	dr.	buehl	to	come	back	with	a	squad	of	quiet	refined	strongarm	boys	who	made	sure	dane	reached	buehl	's	rest	home	safely	when	his	proof	was	complete	and	irrefutable	he	took	it	to	his	editorto	be	fired	politely	but	coldly		
it	would	be	easy	to	slip	to	use	an	overdose	of	something	to	make	sure	dane	was	killed	why	should	n't	i?".he	moved	from	shadow	to	shadow	his	hair	prickling	along	the	base	of	his	neck		
so	i	suppose	i	'm	committed	to	your	boobyhatch	again?".and	there	were	stories	of	corpses	that	had	apparently	fought	and	twisted	in	their	coffins	still	the	shock	treatmentor	whatever	buehl	would	use	under	the	name	of	shock	treatmentwould	begin	at	once		
fear	was	thick	in	his	throat	now	dane	had	spent	ten	years	in	fear	of	being	discovered	by	themand	now	buehl	had	him	he	was	too	late		
it	could	have	been	worse	promise	to	be	quiet	and	we	'll	release	you	"yeah	dane	agreed		
but	it	must	have	been	only	some	animal	there	was	no	way	of	guessing	what	an	alien	might	do	to	anyone	who	discovered	that	all	men	were	not	humanthat	some	were	zombies	it	had	seemed	to	work	too		
they	had	thought	of	everything	including	a	coat	to	cover	his	dirtsoiled	clothes	as	they	took	him	up	the	elevator	to	where	buehl	and	sylvia	were	waiting	for	him	ye	shall	know	the	truth	and	the	truth	shall	make	you	free	then	he	met	sylvia	by	accident	after	losing	his	fifth	joba	girl	who	had	inherited	a	fortune	big	enough	to	spread	his	message	in	paid	ads	across	the	country	but	that	would	n't	matter		
no	i	guess	i	did	n't	really	expect	anything	this	time	we	'll	have	to	use	shock	treatment	it	was	logical	enough	to	shake	dane	's	faith	until	he	came	across	milo	blanding	's	picture	in	a	magazine	article	on	society	in	st.	louis		
he	might	have	guessed	even	if	he	could	drag	back	what	he	might	find	without	the	change	being	completed	they	would	n't	accept	the	evidence	there	are	monsters	who	come	back	from	the	dead		
he	reached	them	at	last	fumbling	them	open	the	works	if	what	he	knew	of	psychiatry	was	correct	he	was	operating	on	purely	automatic	habits	now	the	reaction	from	the	night	and	his	failure	numbing	him	emotionally		
you	can	pick	up	your	pay	on	the	way	out	"hey	burke	there	's	no	corpse	here!".it	had	been	worse	before		
there	was	a	pause	and	then	a	sigh	an	exaggerated	reaction	but	nothing	really	abnormal	"let	him	go		
what	else	could	he	do?.there	were	still	accounts	of	corpses	turned	up	with	the	nails	and	hair	grown	long	in	the	grave	even	if	we	could	get	the	order	without	causewhich	we	ca	n't		
it	was	difficult	but	he	made	it	finally	dropping	onto	the	soft	grass	beyond	nor	was	harding	alonedane	found	enough	evidence	to	know	there	were	others	"so	what

at	dane	's	sickened	nod	he	gestured	to	the	others	other	editors	were	less	polite	what	was	it	like	for	an	alien	then	going	slowly	mad	while	it	waited	for	true	death		
he	shivered	there	were	no	warning	sounds	this	timeonly	hands	that	slipped	under	his	arms	and	across	his	mouth	lifting	him	easily	from	the	grave	and	they	called	him	a	fanatic		
dane	tried	the	window	again	but	it	was	hopeless	"but	after	seeing	your	father	you	ca	n't	associate	blood	with	yourselfyou	see	it	as	a	horrible	wound	on	harding	again	a	sound	in	the	darkness	above	left	him	hovering	and	sick	in	the	hole

he	swung	the	lid	up	and	began	groping	for	the	camera	the	man	beamed	paternally	chuckling	as	he	added	what	he	must	have	considered	the	clincher	the	aliens	would	get	him	of	course	when	the	story	broke	but	a	warned	humanity	could	cope	with	them		
then	you	come	to	from	a	concussion	he	uncovered	the	top	of	the	casket	with	hands	already	blistering	it	had	taken	dane	two	days	of	crawling	and	hiding	to	get	back	to	his	group	too	exhausted	to	report	harding	's	death		
under	different	circumstances	so	you	found	me?".but	he	went	on	doggedly	trying	and	failing	but	he	'd	been	less	lucky	about	hardingblanding

but	they	had	thought	of	everything	he	could	n't	be	sure	okay		
what	happened	when	a	creature	that	could	survive	even	the	poison	of	embalming	fluids	and	the	draining	of	all	the	blood	woke	up	in	such	a	coffin?.where	else	was	there	the	chance	for	all	the	refined	modern	torture	needed	to	burn	out	a	man	's	mind?.lack	of	a	clearer	pattern	of	attack	made	him	consider	the	possibility	of	human	mutation	but	such	tissue	was	too	wildly	different	and	the	invasion	had	begun	long	before	atomics	or	xrays

an	alien	could	have	gotten	away	by	simply	committing	suicide	and	being	carried	from	the	rest	home	but	dane	had	to	do	it	the	hard	way	watching	his	chance	and	using	commando	tactics	on	a	guard	who	had	come	to	accept	him	as	a	harmless	nut	we'll	have	you	out	of	here	in	no	time.".the	u.	n.	has	ruled	that	whoever	comes	back	first	with	mapping	surveys	can	claim	the	territory	mapped		
bill	sighed	scratching	unconsciously	and	made	his	way	somehow	out	to	his	suit	climbing	into	it	there	was	no	room	for	pacing	up	and	down	"where	do	you	want	me	to	put	down		
fifteen	minutes	he'd	have	to	relay	that	information	back	to	the	medics	it	simply	unbalanced	him	without	really	relieving	the	itching		
the	metal	sheets	were	fine	men	had	developed	immunity	to	the	germs	found	on	earth	but	just	as	smallpox	had	proved	so	fatal	to	the	indians	and	syphilis	to	europe	when	they	first	hit	there	was	no	telling	how	wildly	this	might	progress	"we've	got	another	missile	coming	with	metal	foil	for	the	maps	and	photosplus	a	small	copying	camera

there	was	no	response	to	his	signals	you're	about	out	on	your	feet.".he'd	begun	to	notice	the	itching	yesterday	today	he	was	breaking	out	in	the	rash		
bill	thought	it	over	his	head	thick	the	rash	seemed	to	get	worse	on	his	body	as	he	looked	at	it	at	the	end	the	doctor	was	helping	him		
but	keep	us	informed	if	anything	slips	he	looked	for	something	to	do	but	found	nothing	the	salves	had	helped	the	itching	a	little	but	not	much		
the	doctor	was	young	and	obviously	scared	but	fighting	his	fear	"i	do	n't	knowdon't	think	so	but	i	did	n't	look.".but	on	contacting	earth	by	radar	he	was	assured	that	that	might	be	expected		
and	how	about	having	those	doctors	ready?".moonwalking	was	tricky	until	you	learned	how	but	somebody	had	been	in	a	hurry	for	volunteers	and	given	the	man	no	basic	training	at	all		
he	'll	set	down	in	about	nine	hours	"you	think	you	can	land	here	with	whatever	you	've	got	man?.then	his	stomach	began	showing	distress	signs		
some	plant	irritant	like	poison	ivy?.the	suit	was	put	on	and	off	with	automatic	machine	grapples	so	he	could	n't	have	touched	it	he	dragged	out	the	photo	and	copying	equipment	under	a	red	light		
the	supplies	that	had	already	been	sent	up	by	the	superfast	unmanned	missiles	would	give	him	something	to	do	at	least	two	other	nations	have	ships	out	now	he	knew	that		
holding	control	was	the	hardest	job	he	'd	ever	done	"earth	to	mars	rocket	i	he	tried	shifting	the	supplies	around	on	his	back	getting	them	to	press	against	the	spots	of	torment	as	he	walked		
he	began	to	feel	worse	the	tubes	might	burn	out	in	continuous	firing	this	time	he	stumbled	also	as	he	made	his	way	across	the	powdery	rubble

they	could	send	cutting	equipment	with	the	doctor	and	pick	up	the	things	later	he	let	the	grapples	hook	the	suit	off	him	as	soon	as	the	outer	seal	was	shut	and	went	into	a	whirling	dervish	act	give	all	details		
that	helped	him	get	his	emotions	under	control	i	started	to	bring	them	they	were	as	much	in	the	dark	about	this	as	he	was	but	they	had	a	better	background	for	guessing	and	trial	and	error		
ames	caught	his	arm	you	can	print	them	right	on	the	metal	seal	that	in	a	can	and	leave	it	for	the	rocket	that	's	bringing	the	doctor	down	there	men	would	be	sweating	with	him	going	crazy	trying	to	do	something		
he	paused	for	a	final	good	scratch	and	then	the	grapples	took	over	all	he	wanted	was	a	chance	to	get	over	this	disease	before	it	killed	him	those	symptoms	are	perfectly	normal		
he	began	giving	all	the	information	he	had	from	the	first	itching	through	the	rash	and	the	fever	he'd	written	up	the	accounts	we'll	get	a	medical	kit	up	to	the	moon	for	you		
your	symptoms	make	no	sense	he	summarized	he	yanked	out	his	bunk	and	slumped	into	it	curling	up	as	much	as	the	itching	would	permit	but	his	face	was	still	sober		
we	're	rushing	the	construction	but	we	need	the	ship	for	the	second	run	if	we	're	to	claim	our	fair	territory	halfway	to	the	supplies	he	felt	the	itching	come	back	and	he	slithered	and	wriggled	around	trying	to	scratch	his	skin	against	his	clothing	but	somehow	they	made	the	ship	and	were	getting	out	of	the	suitsbill	first	then	the	doctor	using	the	grapples	under	bill	's	guidance		
things	were	a	little	worse	when	the	first	squeals	came	from	the	radar	two	days	later	he	flushed	it	down	his	head	turning	in	circles	and	went	to	the	radar	then	he	swore	gulping	down	more	of	the	pills	where	they	were	waiting	for	him		
again	longer	this	time	the	main	station	hesitated	bill	swore	but	he	was	in	his	suit	when	the	missile	landed	heading	out	across	the	pumicecovered	wastes	toward	it	and	if	the	bugs	in	him	happened	to	like	tachiomycetin	he	would	n't	be	too	much	worse	off		
yeah	insert	the	cat	's	fur	brushes	under	the	cat	's	fur?.he	groped	into	the	supplies	hoping	there	would	be	replacements	"i've	got	a	feeling	some	are	due	to	one	thing	some	to	another		
they	'd	already	been	busy	he	saw	as	he	teetered	down	on	his	jets	for	a	landing	on	tycho	may	not	help	but	we	're	trying	a	mixture	of	the	antibiotics	and	where	were	they	getting	a	doctor	crazy	enough	to	take	a	chance	with	him		
but	the	other	man	was	making	no	real	progress	at	all	like	an	automaton	he	bent	forward	his	other	hand	groping	for	the	mirror	that	should	be	in	one	of	the	drawers	antigravity	his	voice	was	unbelieving	as	he	turned	his	head	to	face	the	older	man		
an	immortal	man	had	suddenly	found	death	hovering	on	his	trail	amanda	probably	would	be	willing	to	marry	him	she	’d	hinted	at	a	date	once	earth	was	becoming	a	backwater	world	no	real	progress	had	been	made	in	two	centuries	the	young	men	were	sent	out	as	soon	as	their	first	fifty	years	of	education	were	finished	and	the	older	men	were	too	conservative	for	really	new	thinking		
that	missile	reached	sirius	in	less	than	ten	days	he’d	only	skimmed	the	report	but	this	made	no	sense	heroism	had	belonged	to	those	who	knew	their	days	were	numbered	anyhow		
now	there	was	no	escaping	it	i	spent	the	night	at	medical	center	going	up	the	ranks	until	i	found	men	who	really	know	about	it	he	got	up	once	to	stare	at	himself	in	the	mirror		
cobb	wants	you	to	come	to	his	office	at	once	sir	he	said	dropping	to	his	knee	to	help	giles	with	his	shoes	eternity!.then	it	was	no	longer	necessary	to	frighten	himself		
he	felt	choked	imprisoned	somehow	lost	the	city	beyond	the	window	blurred	as	he	studied	it	and	he	swung	the	chair	back	so	violently	that	his	hand	jerked	painfully	on	the	forelock	he	’d	been	twisting	outside	on	the	street	he	looked	up	at	the	sun	and	then	at	the	buildings	built	to	last	for	thousands	of	years	for	everybody	not	just	you	it	was	no	consolation		
geriatric	knowledge	is	still	on	record	he	listened	as	giles	stumbled	out	his	story	he	was	passing	near	the	club	and	started	to	slow		
he	snapped	the	switch	and	saw	the	screen	light	up	with	the	people	still	in	the	odd	wheelless	vehicle	on	the	alien	planet	maybe	in	two	centuries	we	’d	have	a	through	route	charted	to	sirius	if	he	looked	that	bad—	but	jordan	was	n’t	looking	at	him	the	man	’s	interest	lay	in	the	projected	picture	from	harry	across	the	desk	from	the	communicator		
suppose	he	could	n’t	rejuvenate	all	the	way?.the	hollows	were	still	there	and	the	circles	under	his	eyes	he	was	getting	positively	childish		
he	’d	grown	old	and	he	’d	grow	older	a	statement	that	lightning	had	never	struck	a	house	was	no	guarantee	that	it	never	would	what	he	needed	was	a	good	night	’s	sleep	after	a	little	relaxation		
how	how	long	cobb	spread	his	hands	unhappily	giles	had	almost	forgotten	it	but	there	was	still	the	same	grin	there	i	was	one	of	the	first	million	cases	when	a	lot	of	people	could	n’t	rejuvenate	at	all	and	i	had	no	trouble	even	then	cobb	considered	it	hesitated	as	if	making	up	his	mind	to	be	frank	against	his	better	judgment		
dr	would	that	reduce	the	slice	of	eternity	that	rejuvenation	meant?.and	the	effect	is	cumulative		
the	worry	nagged	at	him	all	the	way	back	we	know	the	drive	works	even	such	things	as	cancer	could	be	willed	out	of	existence	provided	the	brain	could	be	reached	far	below	the	conscious	level	and	forced	to	operate		
giles	nodded	got	out	and	headed	down	the	hall	uncertainly	he	looked	no	better	the	next	morning	when	he	finally	dragged	himself	up	from	the	little	sleep	he	’d	managed	to	get	i	ca	n’t	see	any	other	explanation		
others	involved	complicated	little	gadgets	that	ran	over	his	body	while	meters	bobbed	and	wiggled	their	eternity	was	no	longer	a	part	of	him	just	how	bad	did	he	look		
so	we	can	send	a	message	on	the	shuttle	begging	for	their	secret	in	a	couple	of	hundred	years!.and	we	still	would	n’t	have	proved	it	safe	for	human	pilots	it	was	none	of	their	business		
he	could	feel	it	there	were	other	white	strands	in	his	dark	hair	maybe	if	we	put	in	stronger	signaling	transmitters	yeah		
he	was	n’t	ready	to	face	jordan	yet	surely	you	did	n’t	think	people	could	miss	that	in	this	day	and	age?.funny	he	could	n’t	picture	really	losing	his	temper	here		
maybe	trying	family	life	again	would	give	him	some	new	interests	that	’s	all	for	now	mr.	giles	he	fought	that	off	but	he	could	n’t	escape	the	nagging	doubts	at	the	doctor	’s	words		
he	barely	mentioned	being	married	on	the	way	or	his	dozen	children	but	filled	most	of	the	frame	with	glowing	description	and	a	plea	for	his	father	to	join	him	there!.rats	do	n’t	have	minds	that	could	show	any	real	damage	such	as	the	loss	of	power	to	rejuvenate	drat	it		
now	he	managed	the	club	on	a	level	of	quasiequality	with	the	members	but	at	last	they	were	through	and	he	was	led	into	the	quiet	rejuvenation	room	where	the	clamps	were	adjusted	about	his	head	and	the	earpieces	were	fitted	giles	tried	to	stop	scaring	himself	and	partially	succeeded	until	he	reached	the	doctor	’s	office		
cobb	appeared	himself	before	the	nurse	could	take	over	and	led	giles	into	a	room	with	an	oldfashioned	desk	and	chairs	that	almost	concealed	the	cabinets	of	equipment	beyond	we’ll	know	by	then	whether	you	’ll	need	more	treatment	find	me	one	volunteer		
and	even	if	exodus	ever	got	the	superlight	drive	working	there	was	no	reason	he	should	give	up	his	work	he	had	no	desire	to	spend	ninety	years	cooped	up	with	a	bunch	of	callow	young	emigrants	even	in	one	of	the	improved	exodus	shuttles	he	groped	for	the	lines	and	could	n’t	remember		
in	the	future	men	would	need	the	superlight	drive	if	they	were	to	span	much	more	of	the	universe	than	now	we’ve	got	a	longer	time	scale	than	we	used	to	have	but	it	’s	in	centuries	not	in	eons	presetting	a	course	may	take	centuries	if	we	can	ever	master	it		
today	though	nothing	seemed	to	help	now	that	he	knew	there	was	reason	for	his	fear	it	seemed	to	vanish	leaving	a	coldness	that	numbed	him	then	it	had	required	months	of	mental	training	followed	by	crude	mechanical	and	drug	hypnosis	for	other	months		
they	went	down	the	hall	to	another	office	where	giles	waited	outside	while	cobb	conferred	with	another	doctor	and	technician	with	much	waving	of	charts	he	was	still	young	one	of	the	few	under	a	hundred	who	’d	escaped	deportation	because	of	special	ability	and	patience	was	still	foreign	to	him	he	remembered	once	when	he	’d	had	a	cold	before	they	finally	licked	that	harry	had	been	a	complete	nuisance	running	around	with	various	nostrums	giving	him	no	peace		
it	may	take	longer	but	eventually	we	’ll	find	a	way	only	his	youngest	son	would	have	sent	an	elaborate	tercentenary	greeting	verse	one	that	would	arrive	ninety	years	too	late!.you	mean	it	did	n’t	take		
giles	nodded	mechanically	it	’s	a	shock	to	me	too	mr.	giles	yet	he	was	n’t	swallowed	by	them	as	he	might	be	by	a	family
