sam	cried	out	to	me	in	anguish	if	you	could	see	your	face	and	hear	the	mournful	tone	of	your	voice!.we	knew	that	fifty	apaches	were	close	to	us	yet	that	we	must	not	betray	our	knowledge	by	the	slightest	sign	and	the	pain	in	my	shoulder	was	not	caused	by	a	millwheel	crushing	me	but	by	the	blow	which	winnetou	had	given	me		
no	matter	how	fast	i	swam	or	what	curves	i	made	the	chief	’s	tomahawk	was	sure	to	overtake	me	i	should	have	taken	this	i	’d	have	shown	him	that	sam	hawkins	can	go	through	the	water	like	a	trout	through	the	warpaint	on	his	face	we	saw	pass	over	it	varying	expressions	of	anger	hatred	and	malice		
it	looked	from	where	the	indians	stood	as	though	i	had	killed	him	and	again	i	heard	that	awful	howl	get	to	the	cedar	quick	shouted	sam	hawkins	i	rose	and	they	tied	my	hands	together		
braves	let	us	laugh	at	him	he	looked	around	invitingly	but	no	one	laughed	and	he	said	you	are	afraid	of	him	but	i	will	show	you	how	i	mock	him	but	i	felt	sure	that	in	this	case	it	was	only	because	the	chief	and	winnetou	were	too	heavily	encumbered	by	the	corpse	of	klekipetrah	and	in	too	great	haste	to	avenge	his	murder	to	obliterate	the	trace	of	their	course	and	rode	on	with	no	fear	of	an	ambush	the	great	spirit	gives	him	into	my	hand	by	taking	away	his	senses	among	indians	this	sort	of	preliminary	fight	with	tongues	is	customary	and	i	should	have	been	considered	cowardly	if	i	had	stood	silent	so	i	answered	you	fight	with	the	mouth	but	i	have	here	a	knife	take	your	place	if	you	are	not	afraid	he	bounded	into	the	other	circle	crying	angrily	afraid		
the	grizzly	if	i	speak	later	you	will	see	that	old	shatterhand	is	not	a	man	whose	word	is	to	be	despised	intschutschuna	turned	from	us	and	nodded	to	certain	old	warriors	who	left	the	circle	and	gathered	around	him	for	consultation	while	tangua	of	course	used	every	effort	to	turn	the	decision	as	he	wished	on	the	day	of	my	death	you	have	said	it		
i	hastened	to	see	if	sam	was	hurt	and	found	him	standing	much	shaken	but	not	otherwise	the	worse	they’ll	all	be	here	shortly	my	fair	young	nurse	dipped	the	cloth	in	the	water	and	bathed	the	face	and	hands	of	the	supposed	enemy	of	her	father	and	brother		
of	course	he	perceived	this	and	i	feared	he	would	make	a	movement	which	would	betray	me	but	he	was	much	too	wise	and	had	too	much	presence	of	mind	for	that	he	has	only	made	statements	but	has	not	proved	them	it	may	be	imagined	how	excited	they	were	at	this	announcement	sam	dick	and	will	more	than	i.		
for	i	the	former	blasphemer	now	seek	to	find	his	will	in	all	things	i	doubt	your	being	a	thief	or	a	murderer	i	laughed	as	i	spoke	but	he	said	gravely	thank	you	but	you	are	mistaken	it	’s	better	a	hopeless	greenhorn	should	die	than	a	valuable	experienced	scout		
our	companions	slept	our	fire	had	burned	low	and	all	the	kiowas’	fires	were	out	but	one	they	must	wipe	out	this	stain	by	fighting	him	an	angry	dilation	of	his	pupil	warned	me	and	the	next	moment	his	right	arm	struck	quickly	and	forcibly	upward	to	rip	my	body	like	an	old	coat		
would	you	like	to	see	the	envelope	asked	sam	dismounting	i	caught	his	right	hand	and	squeezed	it	till	he	dropped	the	knife	then	i	seized	his	left	arm	at	the	elbow	and	pulled	him	over	till	he	had	to	let	go	of	my	throat	i	have	spoken		
though	his	eyes	might	once	have	been	piercing	angry	threatening	now	they	were	as	calm	and	clear	as	a	forest	lake	i	ca	n’t	look	on	at	this	winnetou	rode	all	night	to	this	point	do	you	see	that	the	trail	goes	on	from	here	in	single	file		
the	fire	was	getting	low	and	i	thought	there	was	no	use	in	putting	off	the	evil	hour	so	i	yawned	stretched	myself	and	said	i	’m	tired	and	i	’d	like	to	go	to	sleep	how	about	you	sam	i	’ve	no	objection	he	said	when	we	take	the	skin	off	we	can	see	what	killed	him	don’t	bother	yourself	with	the	affairs	of	others		
they	stood	shouting	and	questioning	on	the	bank	while	the	chief	still	swam	back	and	forth	waiting	for	me	although	i	could	not	possibly	have	remained	so	long	under	water	sam	scanned	the	sky	and	then	said	apparently	we	are	going	to	have	rain	today	and	that	happens	rarely	about	here	but	is	the	very	best	thing	for	our	plan	why	i	asked	the	guns	lay	at	some	distance	back	of	us	towards	the	peninsula	ready	to	be	seized	by	us	later	in	our	flight		
what	torture	is	intended	for	him	everything	possible	we	had	not	gone	far	from	camp	and	had	lain	down	under	a	tree	where	i	could	study	his	face	and	expression	at	leisure	though	they	were	curious	none	asked	further	questions	for	like	the	beast	he	had	captured	when	sam	would	n’t	he	would	n’t	and	that	was	the	end	of	it		
how	should	i	manage?.we’d	better	go	on	a	few	steps	and	be	first	or	some	kiowa	will	get	ahead	of	us	disregarding	all	my	signals	to	him	sam	had	taken	the	indians	to	our	men	who	were	in	a	high	state	of	delight	when	they	learned	they	had	come	in	friendship	and	there	was	no	longer	any	reason	for	our	fearing	the	apaches		
it	was	otherwise	with	me	the	trail	was	easily	followed	a	fact	which	made	sam	doubt	its	being	trustworthy	for	he	said	that	when	an	indian	left	his	course	so	easily	traced	by	an	enemy	the	chance	was	it	was	done	only	to	lead	that	enemy	into	a	trap	then—	this	miserable	coyote	lies	as	if	he	had	a	hundred	tongues	cried	tangua		
i	had	sprung	at	him	as	soon	as	i	saw	his	intention	but	too	late	where	is	my	mule	he	cried	old	shatterhand	must	shoot	first	no	i	said		
when	i	came	to	myself	it	was	evening	so	long	had	i	lain	unconscious	then	the	apaches	will	come	and	find	no	one!.when	you	went	into	that	circle	my	heart	stood	still	i	could	not	breathe	and	my	thoughts	were	full	of	how	i	’d	carry	out	this	tenderfoot	’s	last	will	and	testament		
to	have	proof	that	it	was	really	i	who	had	freed	him	the	hearts	of	the	warriors	of	the	glorious	tribe	of	the	kiowas	are	brave	and	wise	he	seemed	to	be	as	i	afterwards	learned	he	was	of	the	same	age	as	myself	and	his	appearance	made	as	profound	an	impression	on	me	then	when	i	saw	him	first	as	his	character	has	left	upon	me	today	after	our	long	friendship		
you	’ve	got	to	eat	your	words	i	felt	that	i	must	punish	this	indian	not	merely	for	justice’	sake	and	the	effect	on	the	apaches	but	for	the	benefit	of	those	white	men	whom	he	might	meet	in	the	future	a	wish	and	its	tragic	fulfilment	you	do	not	speak	like	a	westerner	said	klekipetrah	as	we	started	now	one	two—	he	held	the	knife	tight	and	i	should	have	shot	him	not	in	the	head	but	in	the	hand	for	he	had	to	learn	to	respect	me	but	luckily	i	did	not	get	so	far	for	at	this	moment	a	loud	voice	cried	men	are	you	mad		
the	room	was	bare	but	nschotschi	furnished	it	quickly	with	skins	covers	and	ornaments	so	that	i	felt	at	home	at	once	before	i	put	a	hand	down	i	first	felt	the	spot	to	make	sure	there	were	no	twigs	that	would	crackle	under	the	weight	of	my	body	and	thus	betray	me	and	if	i	had	to	go	under	or	between	branches	i	tested	them	carefully	to	make	sure	that	i	could	get	through	therefore	the	white	men	of	the	west	call	him	old	shatterhand	thus	without	any	choice	of	mine	i	was	given	the	name	which	has	ever	since	clung	to	me

it	came	from	winnetou	how	these	wishes	were	not	very	practical	but	they	seemed	to	please	the	indians	as	much	as	if	they	were	already	fulfilled	when	i	saw	his	face	i	thought	it	would	go	hard	with	intschutschuna	and	winnetou	if	they	fell	into	his	hands

the	fairytale	and	i	we	are	being	read	by	thousands	without	being	understood	because	the	depth	is	not	explored	where	this	journey	took	me	and	what	happened	on	it	shall	be	reported	in	the	second	volume	but	once	the	admission	is	made	honestly	and	according	to	the	truth	that	my	traveller	's	tales	have	not	been	written	for	the	young	generation	the	foundation	of	the	nowadays	commonplace	supposition	that	they	were	harmful	has	been	removed		
there	they	were	singing	grandmother	could	not	give	him	anything	i	consider	it	necessary	to	state	here	that	i	did	not	regard	my	condition	as	pathological	at	all		
i	did	not	put	the	watch	back	into	my	pocket	but	into	my	suit	where	it	did	not	belong	to	and	as	soon	as	this	had	happened	the	gendarme	returned	to	get	me	when	my	lawyer	informed	me	of	this	threat	it	all	became	so	very	clear	to	me	 	i	started	to	comprehend	and	felt	obliged	to	probe	this	terrain	it	was	a	joy	to	see	how	excellently	this	was	developing		
but	i	did	not	sleep	tight	 	i	kept	on	waking	up	and	high	above	us	was	the	salvation	was	the	noble	state	of	the	human	soul	we	had	to	aspire	up	to	particular	attention	was	devoted	on	me		
what	for?.i	confess	that	by	this	promise	he	had	already	won	me	over	more	than	half	of	the	way	she	did	not	want	to	answer	 	but	i	asked	her	until	she	did		
whether	novelists	and	artists	would	accept	me	as	a	colleague	i	had	to	ignore	then	but	what	this	meant	in	practice	i	could	see	all	around	me	in	a	truthfulness	which	was	just	as	plain	as	it	was	disturbing	new	rumours	circulated	with	romantic	embellishments		
the	concepts	and	views	of	the	law	change	 	the	lie	turns	into	the	truth	the	truth	into	the	lie	the	ancestors	had	tested	these	effects	and	had	added	very	many	marginal	notes	to	the	volume	telling	about	the	results	of	these	tests	they	screamed	and	cheered	and	mocked	so	that	my	ears	were	ringing		
it	was	regarded	as	the	only	relief	from	worry	and	its	worst	effects	were	accepted	as	if	this	was	the	most	natural	thing	in	the	world	there	are	hostile	people	who	have	said	that	i	had	only	sought	contact	with	this	catholic	publisher	for	the	sake	of	money	but	all	of	my	conceptions	of	art	were	something	entirely	different	than	this	what	today	's	critics	describe	as	art	and	thus	i	was	left	with	no	other	choice	than	to	postpone	all	of	my	wishes	which	concerned	me	being	allowed	to	be	an	artist	in	literature	an	artist	who	is	a	true	valuable	artist	for	many	many	long	years	and	to	remain	until	then	what	i	was	at	the	time	a	beginner	who	is	not	a	part	of	the	established	business	and	who	made	no	pretension	to	becoming	a	member	of	it		
maeterlinck	    	nevertheless	used	heyse	's	ideas	but	in	a	manner	which	did	not	    	constitute	plagiarism	and	openly	pointed	this	out	in	an	    	appendix	to	the	german	edition	of	his	play	i	could	not	find	any	thoughts	near	the	end	the	reproach	got	milder	and	in	the	end	he	cheerfully	extended	to	me	the	ignorant	boy	his	hand	and	told	me	that	he	would	not	be	too	excessively	appalled	if	after	four	or	five	years	had	passed	another	one	of	my	indian	stories	should	end	up	on	his	desk		
their	contents	had	constituted	such	strong	evidence	in	a	lawsuit	against	münchmeyer	that	i	simply	had	to	win	it	"dead	   	deceased!".he	figured	out	that	with	six	to	seven	thousand	subscribers	he	would	break	even	 	everything	beyond	this	was	profit		
this	would	have	given	me	enough	space	and	time	for	what	i	intended	he	attended	all	markets	all	inns	and	bars	in	order	to	buy	or	to	find	buyers	this	enraged	him		
destiny	seemed	to	agree	with	my	intentions	i	only	knew	that	the	rumour	was	about	those	novels	i	had	written	for	münchmeyer	but	i	found	no	one	who	would	have	been	able	to	name	the	chapters	and	the	passages	to	me	where	this	indecency	would	be	contained	you	can	easily	imagine	that	there	was	no	school	and	no	work	on	that	day		
when	i	wanted	to	work	by	day	i	could	not	achieve	anything	i	liked	this	even	more	if	he	sues	us	we	will	destroy	him	by	publishing	his	 	|	|	prior	convictions	in	all	newspapers	throughout	germany		
the	sisters	also	had	other	interests	this	is	just	as	selfevident	as	it	is	correct	then	i	left	town		
fischer	complained	that	in	buying	the	münchmeyer	business	he	had	degraded	himself	to	the	level	of	a	trashy	publisher	 	he	assured	us	that	he	was	yearning	to	get	out	of	this	and	he	insisted	that	i	could	assist	him	in	this	like	nobody	else	whether	this	is	a	blessing	or	a	shortcoming	i	can	not	decide	 	but	due	to	this	idiosyncrasy	of	mine	it	happens	rather	frequently	that	i	regard	an	ugly	person	as	pretty	and	a	pretty	person	as	ugly	he	wanted	whatever	was	good	and	beneficent	to	me
