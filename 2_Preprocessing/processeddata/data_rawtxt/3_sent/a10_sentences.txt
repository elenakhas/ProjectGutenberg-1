Too good to last..Then M'Connachie's superb air of dropping it into the gutter...		
I am far from taking a side against the classics..'The sun's torch suddenly flashed upon his face    and died; and he sat content in subject night    and dreamed of an old dead foe that had sought      and found him;    a beast stirred bodly in his restingplace;    And the cold came; Man rose to his masterheight,    shivered, and turned away; but the mists were      round him.'.But thoughtless follies laid him low,       And stained his name.'		
I remember Scott by Highland streams trying to rouse me by maintaining that haggis is boiled bagpipes; Henley in dispute as to whether, say, Turgenieff or Tolstoi could hang the other on his watchchain; he sometimes clenched the argument by casting his crutch at you; Stevenson responded in the same gay spirit by giving that crutch to John Silver; you remember with what adequate results..You have more in common with the Youth of other lands than Youth and Age can ever have with each other; even the hostile countries sent out many a son very like ours, from the same sort of homes, the same sort of universities, who had as little to do as our youth had with the origin of the great adventure..You say to yourself, 'What an interesting face; I wonder what he is to be up to?'		
Very little, I warn you, if you are merely thinking of yourselves; much if what is at the marrow of your thoughts is a future that even you can scarcely hope to see..Of course he would put it more suavely than that, though it is not, I think, by gentleness that you will get your rights; we are dogged ones at sticking to what we have got, and so will you be at our age..Without suspicion there might have been no war.		
But the things courage can do!.Yes, but some of them are golden only because we let them slip..I should as soon argue against your having tops to your heads; that way lie the best tops.		
If there is any of you here so rare that the seekers have taken an illwill to him, as to the boy who wrote those lines, I ask you to be careful..It was a frosty night, and he was naked and painted black..How courteously tolerant was I of the postman without a proof for us; how M'Connachie, on the other hand, wanted to punch his head.		
It begins:   'We are pegging out in a very comfortless spot..Another sure way to fame is to know what you mean..To be born poor is probably the next best thing.		
Whatever bludgeonings may be gathering for you, I think one feels more poignantly at your age than ever again in life..They will not take our word for it that they did not..Then spirits walk.		
Perhaps I may be arrested on leaving the hall..It is a solemn thought that almost no oneif he is truly eminentknows what he means..He pushed a raft containing these in front of him.		
What says our glorious Johnson of courage: 'Unless a man has that virtue he has no security for preserving any other.'.There are circumstances in which nothing can so well become a land, as I think this land proved when the late war did break out and there was but one thing to do..This courage is a proof of our immortality, greater even than gardens 'when the eve is cool.'		
In the war it was not the fighting men who were distinguished for abuse; as has been well said, 'Hell hath no fury like a noncombatant.'.Be not disheartened by ideals of perfection which can be achieved only by those who run away..Finally they looked through the books of the monastery, and these revealed that there had been a Father Anselm there a hundred or more years before.		
So forward, brave hearts..But there are the complacent toddlers from the start..He did it, crawled through the scrub to listen to the talk of the enemy, who were so near that he could have shaken hands with them, lit his decoys and swam back.		
I want you to think well of me   and my end.'.To what adventures I cannot tell, but I know that your God is watching to see whether you are adventurous..We did intend to finish ourselves   when things proved like this, but we have decided to die   naturally without.'		
So you will have to work harder..Courage..Courage is the thing.		
It was a desperate business, but he saved my foot, and here I am.'.I hope you are fairly noisy and that members are sometimes let out..What is beauty?		
It is a letter to me from Captain Scott of the Antarctic, and was written in the tent you know of, where it was found long afterwards with his body and those of some other very gallant gentlemen, his comrades..So thank you kindly, and would you please give them back their boy by tearing up the scroll?.Learn as a beginning how worldshaking situations arise and how they may be countered.		
We know what he has been up to..You ought to have a League of Youth of all countries as your beginning, ready to say to all Governments, 'We will fight each other but only when we are sure of the necessity.'..		
Do you keep to the old topics?.That is a way, but not so easy as you think..Your answer is that the war and other happenings have shown you that age is not necessarily another name for sapience; that our avoidance of frankness in life and in the arts is often, but not so often as you think, a cowardly way of shirking unpalatable truths, and that you have taken us off our pedestals because we look more natural on the ground.		
There is an officer who was the first of our Army to land at Gallipoli..The magic days when our article appeared in an evening paper..There he was, ladies and gentlemen, and what he was doing during that 'desperate business' was singing that he was master of his fate.		
Hanker not too much after worldly prosperitythat corpulent cigar; if you became a millionaire you would probably go swimming around for more like a diseased goldfish..I think in his youth he must somehow have guessed the future and been fleggit by it, flichtered from the nest like a bird, and so our eggs were left, cold..This play might become historical as the opening of your propaganda in the proposed campaign.		
How about the light that burns in our Principal's room after decent people have gone to bed?.I don't know; he sounds to me like a sloppy, watery sort of fellow; happy, perhaps, but if there be red blood in him impossible..Doubt all your betters who would deny you that right of partnership.		
..It was a twohours' swim in pitch darkness..I should be afraid of his advising a great many of us to be diligent in sitting still and doing no more harm.		
Hoping this letter may be found and sent to you, I write   you a word of farewell..Look at the great ones of the earth, the politicians..The youth who went to the war had no such knowledge, no such say; I am sure the survivors, of whom there must be a number here today, want you to be wiser than they were, and are certainly determined to be wiser next time themselves.		
I found the other day an old letter from Henley that told me of the circumstances in which he wrote that poem..Perhaps the saddest lines in poetry, written by a man who could make things new for the gods themselves..They have come to thank the Senatus for their lovely scroll and to ask them to tear it up.		
The greatest Scotsman that ever lived wrote himself down a failure:    'The poor inhabitant below    Was quick to learn and wise to know    And keenly felt the friendly glow       And softer flame..He had many a fault well known to them; he was not always so noble; as a scholar he did no more than scrape through; and he sometimes made his father rage and his mother grieve..My socalled labours were just M'Connachie running away with me again.		
For reasons you may guess I must give this in a low voice..I think he should ask an alumna of St. Andrews to play the old lady (indicating Miss Ellen Terry)..Despite sickness, poortith, want and all, he was grinding all his life at the one job he revelled in.		
Mainly, not altogether    'I am the master of my fate,    I am the captain of my soul.'.You have not our December roses to help you; but you have June coming, whose roses do not wonder, as do ours even while they give us their fragrancewondering most when they give us mostthat we should linger on an empty scene..They call to you to find out in time the truth about this great game, which your elders play for stakes and Youth plays for its life.		
If his theme were the Rector's favourite, diligence..The spring of the year lies buried in the fields of France and elsewhere..He was very glad she was such a pretty mother.		
It is always easy to discover where a fairies' ball is being held, as ribbons are stretched between it and all the populous parts of the Gardens, on which those invited may walk to the dance without wetting their pumps..Trumpets brayed, the moon came out, and immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring..Peter asked.		
She couldn't help it..Maimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared, though she had really no hope; no one seemed to have the least hope except Brownie herself, who, however, was absolutely confident..Peter asked tragically.		
But Peter hesitated..his heart, the doctor said, remained cold..He would not eat worms or insects (which they thought very silly of him), so they brought him bread in their beaks.		
'I should like to,' she answered, 'but will there be room in your boat for two?'.He popped off the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments..She did a very kind thing; she took off her scarf and gave it to him.		
When a real bird falls in flop, he spreads out his feathers and pecks them dry, but Peter could not remember what was the thing to do, and he decided rather sulkily to go to sleep on the weepingbeech in the Baby Walk..I shall tell you presently how he got his paddle..She said there was only time now to walk to the top of the Hump and back, and as they trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little breasts.		
Another good plan, which David and I sometimes follow, is to stare them down..But Maimie's curiosity tugged her forward, and presently at the seven Spanish chestnuts she saw a wonderful light..Between the well and the Round Pond are the cricket pitches, and frequently the choosing of sides exhausts so much time that there is scarcely any cricket.		
'It is coming nearer!'.He remained sitting on the floor and held his breath, wondering how she knew that he had come back..He cannot with dignity retreat, but he stops and looks about him as if lost in admiration of the scenery, and presently he strolls away with a fine indifference and a glint at me from the corner of his eye.		
Perhaps the drawer had creaked; at any rate, his mother woke up, for he heard her say 'Peter,' as if it was the most lovely word in the language..Occasionally swans touched on the island, and he would give them all his day's food and then ask them how they sat on the water, but as soon as he had no more to give them the hateful things hissed at him and sailed away..She was led before his grace, and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal heart, which for convenience' sake was reached by a little trapdoor in his diamond shirt, had begun to say mechanically, 'Cold, qui,' when he stopped abruptly.		
'No.'.They are grateful little people, too, and at the princess's comingofage ball (they come of age on their second birthday and have a birthday every month) they gave him the wish of his heart..Nevertheless, there was a very disagreeable incident one day when some forward girls challenged David's team, and a disturbing creature called Angela Clare sent down so many yorkers thatHowever, instead of telling you the result of that regrettable match I shall pass on hurriedly to the Round Pond, which is the wheel that keeps all the gardens going.		
For the sweetest craft that slips her moorings in the Round Pond is what is called a stickboat, because she is rather like a stick until she is in the water and you are holding the string..Twilight crept over the Gardens, and hundreds of people passed out, including the last one, who always has to run for it, but Maimie saw them not..For weeks afterwards you can see the ring on the grass.		
This does not mean that they are black, for night has its colours just as day has, but ever so much brighter..They then said, 'Welladay,' and 'Such is life,' for they can be frightfully sarcastic; but she felt sorry for those of them who had no crutches, and she said goodnaturedly, 'Before I go to the fairies' ball, I should like to take you for a walk one at a time; you can lean on me, you know.'.You see, the birds were always begging him for bits of it to line their nests with, and, being very goodnatured, he could not refuse, so by Solomon's advice he had hidden what was left of it.		
They tried to dissuade him, and even put obstacles in the way..But he thought it was a ball, and Jenny Wren had told him that boys kick balls, so he kicked it; and after that he could not find it anywhere..So she scudded away up the ribbon, calling out to Maimie not to follow lest the Queen should mischief her.		
She was about forty round the waist..They hold their great balls in the open air, in what is called a fairy ring..But Peter never grows any older, and if we could be watching for him under the bridge tonight (but, of course, we can't), I dare say we should see him hoisting his nightgown and sailing or paddling towards us in the Thrush's Nest.		
You can't think how pleased Peter was to learn that all the people outside the gates knew about him..There were thousands of little people looking on, but they were in shadow and drab in colour compared to the glorious creatures within that luminous circle, who were so bewilderingly bright that Maimie had to wink hard all the time she looked at them..Every living thing was shunning him.		
Another was lolling on a garden chair, reading a postagestamp which some human had let fall, and when he heard Peter's voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip..'What's this?'.Oh, he was merry!		
They told him the truth about hideandseek, and he often plays it by himself, but even the ducks on the Round Pond could not explain to him what it is that makes the pond so fascinating to boys..Well, you can see their houses by dark, but you can't see them by day, for they are the colour of night, and I never heard of any one yet who could see night in the daytime..When the ayah reached the gate and saw Tony far in front she thought her other charge was with him and passed out.		
A regiment of Lancers came charging down the Broad Walk, armed with hollyleaves, with which they jag the enemy horribly in passing..Very reluctantly Peter began to take the thimble off his finger..But it is not; it simply means that she is doing as she has seen the fairies do; she begins by following their ways, and it takes about two years to get her into the human ways.		
After this it was most orderly..He quite argued with her as if she could hear him..His oddities tickled them every day] Peter wore no nightgown now.		
It was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his own home he skimmed away over St. Paul's to the Crystal Palace and back by the river and Regent's Park, and by the time he reached his mother's window he had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird..They were sitting by this time on a fallen tree; Peter had cleared off the snow for Maimie, but he sat on a snowy bit himself..Him we carried in triumph to our other friend, with the story of that Saturday to Monday, and never shall I forget the gloating joy with which Mr. Salford leapt at him.		
The iron bars are up for life..It was the Closing of the Gates..Oh, dear no!		
Then Peter, who knew them for the fairies, called out that he was not an ordinary human and had no desire to do them displeasure, but to be their friend; nevertheless, having found a jolly harbour, he was in no temper to draw off therefrom, and he warned them if they sought to mischief him to stand to their harms..It is the stickboat that is freighted with memories..It was the time of the year when they should have been pairing, but not a thrush's nest was built except this big one, and so Solomon soon ran short of thrushes with which to supply the demand from the mainland.		
But he did not play with his precious banknote, for he knew what it was at once, having been very observant during the week when he was an ordinary boy..Perhaps a human voice frightened the little house, or maybe it now knew that its work was done, for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began to grow smaller; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking, yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now..So he stretched out his hand to pull it to him, but this time it ran at him, and he was so alarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat.		
Then he would make her presents of his favourite toys (which he always took away from her next morning), and she accepted them with a disturbing smile..'Of course they might want your clothes,' he had to admit rather falteringly..The bowlegged children in the Gardens are those who had to walk too soon because their father needed the perambulator.		
[Illustration: When you meet grownup people in the Gardens who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are] Peter was a just master, and paid his workpeople every evening..But she looked sad, and he knew why she looked sad..All children could have such recollections if they would press their hands hard to their temples, for, having been birds before they were human, they are naturally a little wild during the first few weeks, and very itchy at the shoulders, where their wings used to be.		
You yachtsmen with your wands, who think we are all there to gaze on you, your ships are only accidents of this place, and were they all to be boarded and sunk by the ducks, the real business of the Round Pond would be carried on as usual..He had to fly back, sobbing, to the Gardens, and he never saw his dear again..Naturally Queen Mab felt disgraced, and first she tried the effect of ordering the court into tears for nine minutes, and then she blamed the Cupids and decreed that they should wear fools' caps until they thawed the Duke's frozen heart.		
'How could you get across?'.You see, though still a tiny child, it was really years and years since he had seen his mother, and I dare say the baby who had supplanted him was now a man with whiskers..and 'But will it wear?'		
There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk, where Maimie arrived in time to see a magnolia and a Persian lilac step over the railing and set off for a smart walk..Certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy again, but on the other hand, what times those had been in the Gardens!.they asked, quite surprised, and, really, Peter could not explain how he knew.		
But she spoke no more, she made little moans only, and when he next peeped at her she was once more asleep, with tears on her face..That, I am afraid, is how Peter regarded it..'Not at all,' cried a glowworm; 'if she were to wake without seeing a nightlight she might be frightened, so I shall be her nightlight.'		
But as Peter sat by the shore tootling divinely on his pipe he sometimes fell into sad thoughts, and then the music became sad also, and the reason of all this sadness was that he could not reach the Gardens, though he could see them through the arch of the bridge..Maimie cried indignantly, for she knew what it was to have a dripping umbrella about your ears..It was amazing and even irritating to her that the Duke of Christmas Daisies should be able to keep out of love for a moment: yet out of love his dusky grace still was: you could see it by the shamed looks of the Queen and court (though they pretended not to care), by the way darling ladies brought forward for his approval burst into tears as they were told to pass on, and by his own most dreary face.		
The reason she felt no more fear was that it was now nighttime, and in the dark, you remember, Maimie was always rather strange..which shows that even now he had not quite forgotten what it was to be a boy..Many nights, and even months, passed before he asked the fairies for his second wish; and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so long.		
and he gasped and then nodded..And when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept..The highborn fairies obtain this admired effect by pricking their skin, which lets the blue blood come through and dye them, and you cannot imagine anything so dazzling unless you have seen the ladies' busts in the jewellers' windows.		
'I believe no one could teach that to you,' she answered adoringly, but Peter thought she meant that he was stupid..Perhaps you wonder why he did not swim across..They then said, 'Welladay,' and 'Such is life,' for they can be frightfully sarcastic; but she felt sorry for those of them who had no crutches, and she said goodnaturedly, 'Before I go to the fairies' ball, I should like to take you for a walk one at a time; you can lean on me, you know.'		
Maimie could also see the pompous doctor feeling the Duke's heart and hear him give utterance to his parrot cry, and she was particularly sorry for the Cupids, who stood in their fools' caps in obscure places and, every time they heard that 'Cold, quite cold,' bowed their disgraced little heads..At this the thrushes began to fidget, which made Peter tremble for his scheme..How nice that would be to him, but oh!		
Having escaped the danger of which, he was mercifully carried into a small bay, where his boat rode at peace..They were wheeling a handcart with the flowers in it, and were quite surprised to find the bed occupied..Poor Peter uttered a little moan at this, and he cried for the first time for I know not how long.		
Well, Peter Pan got out by the window, which had no bars..'Never, never!'.For weeks afterwards you can see the ring on the grass.		
'The window I flew out at will be open,' Peter said confidently..But if it was the same one, it was Peter Pan's light..Most gladsome sight of all, the Cupids plucked the hated fools' caps from their heads and cast them high in the air.		
'O mother!'.You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball..When they came up to whip Maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquillynot shamming, you know, but really sleeping, and looking like the sweetest little angel, which seems to me to make it almost worse.		
You must not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back..Peter also felt strangely uncomfortable, as if his head was stuffy; he heard loud noises that made him look round sharply, though they were really himself sneezing..I shall tell you presently how he got his paddle.		
I have promised to tell you also about his paddle..Most of them really are flowers, but some of them are fairies..'If I chose to go back to mother,' he asked at last, 'could you give me that wish?'		
They have a postman, but he never calls except at Christmas with his little box, and though they have beautiful schools, nothing is taught in them; the youngest child being chief person is always elected mistress, and when she has called the roll, they all go out for a walk and never come back..But the kite broke to pieces in the air, and he would have been drowned in the Serpentine had he not caught hold of two indignant swans and made them carry him to the island..P.' is written on the corner of the invitationcards sent out by all really good families.		
She thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket, and tried to pull it over her head..The windows were the size of a coloured picturebook and the door rather smaller, but it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof..'Maimie,' he said, 'will you marry me?'		
replied the oak bitingly, 'how deliciously cosy it is to stand here buttoned to the neck and watch you poor naked creatures shivering.'.'You are twenty thousand times braver than Tony,' she said; 'you are ever so much the bravest boy I ever knew.'.You know the boards which tell at what time the Gardens are to close today.		
that she had to come out and show herself..But Solomon was rightthere is no second chance, not for most of us..'And if you want very much to give me a kiss,' Maimie said, 'you can do it.'		
The fairies are exquisite dancers, and that is why one of the first things the baby does is to sign to you to dance to him and then to cry when you do it..'Why don't you go?'.'What's this,' he cried, and first he shook the heart like a watch, and then he put his ear to it.		
'Thank you,' she replied, 'I was so cosy and warm..It was under a limetree, near the entrance to the Fairy Queen's Winter Palace (which is within the circle of the seven Spanish chestnuts), and Peter approached it warily, for the birds had never mentioned such things to him..Peter now gave him a pound.		
He was a poet; and they are never exactly grownup..Then all the thrushes hopped for joy, and that very day was begun the celebrated Building of the Boat..But there is also a way of finding out about the ball before it takes place.		
She stepped out by the roof, right over the garden, and then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the night..You never can be sure of them, but a good plan is to walk by looking the other way, and then turn round sharply..He could scarcely believe she meant it, but when he did believe he screamed with joy.		
If you think he was the only baby who ever wanted to escape, it shows how completely you have forgotten your own young days..'You will be a BetwixtandBetween,' Solomon said, and certainly he was a wise old fellow, for that is exactly how it turned out..Lest it was alive, he addressed it politely; and then, as it gave no answer, he went nearer and felt it cautiously.		
He cannot with dignity retreat, but he stops and looks about him as if lost in admiration of the scenery, and presently he strolls away with a fine indifference and a glint at me from the corner of his eye..Perhaps a human voice frightened the little house, or maybe it now knew that its work was done, for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began to grow smaller; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking, yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now..The crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees and shrubs.		
how exquisitely delicious it would be to her..She was disappointed not to see Peter Pan, and I may as well tell you now why he was so late that night..They traced Maimie easily by her footprints in the snow.		
That was the beginning of fairies..This enables them to get begun half an hour earlier..It is because Peter wearies for summer and plays that it has come, and the chestnut being so near, hears him and is cheated.		
When the first baby laughed for the first time, his laugh broke into a million pieces, and they all went skipping about..This hoop always sank at once, but he waded in for it, and sometimes he dragged it gleefully round the rim of the pond, and he was quite proud to think that he had discovered what boys do with hoops..When David heard this story first he was quite certain that he had never tried to escape, but I told him to think back hard, pressing his hands to his temples, and when he had done this hard, and even harder, he distinctly remembered a youthful desire to return to the treetops, and with that memory came others, as that he had lain in bed planning to escape as soon as his mother was asleep, and how she had once caught him halfway up the chimney.		
But he smoked their design, and though on occasions he began, 'I wish' he always stopped in time..But Peter hesitated..You will see presently why thrushes only were invited.		
He looked forward to retiring by and by, and devoting his green old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yewstump in the Figs which had taken his fancy, and for years he had been quietly filling his stocking..Maimie stamped her foot naughtily, and was putting her fingers to her eyes, when she heard a kind voice say, 'Don't cry, pretty human, don't cry,' and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy regarding her wistfully..What a glorious boy he had meant to be to her!		
There are also numbers of them along the Baby Walk, which is a famous gentle place, as spots frequented by fairies are called..But, first, he had to tell the birds of the value of Shelley's boat; and though they were too honest to demand it back, he saw that they were galled, and they cast such black looks at Solomon, who was rather vain of his cleverness, that he flew away to the end of the island, and sat there very depressed with his head buried in his wings..At last, with a grand design burning within his brave heart, he begged them to do it once more with him clinging to the tail, and now a hundred flew off with the string, and Peter clung to the tail, meaning to drop off when he was over the Gardens.
