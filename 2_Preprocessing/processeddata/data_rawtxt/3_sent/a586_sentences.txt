I shall follow the footpath that crosses  Over the hill by the peartree, and thence descends through our vineyard,  Taking a shorter way home..But henceforth in the heat of the day when the draught shall refresh you,  When in the shade ye enjoy your rest beside a clear fountain,  Think of me then sometimes and of all my affectionate service,  Prompted more by my love than the duty I owed you as kindred..Then the pastor replied, and pressed the money upon him:  "None should be backward in giving in days like the present, and no one  Ought to refuse to accept those gifts which in kindness are offered.		
"Let us make haste," said the thoughtful man: "the youth's waiting in torture;  Come I let him hear, as soon as he may, the jubilant tidings.".He will reopen tomorrow, when plane and saw will be started,  And will keep on through the hours of labor from morning till evening..Thus she spoke, and the broad stone steps meanwhile had descended  With her companion beside her, and on the low wall of the fountain  Both sat them down.		
Hermann resolved that here he would halt, with his horses and carriage,  Under the shade of the trees..Yes, my Hermann, thy father's old age thou greatly canst gladden,  If thou a daughterinlaw will speedily bring to my dwelling,  Out of the neighborhood here,from the house over yonder, the green one..Thereupon fiercely arose in our men the stern resolution  What had been lost to avenge, and defend whate'er was remaining,  Every man sprang to his arms, by the flight of the foeman encouraged,  And by his blanching cheeks, and his timorous, wavering glances.		
Straightway the son broke in, and with wing'ed words made he answer:  "Do so, neighbor, and go and make thine inquiries; but with thee  I should be glad if our minister here were joined in the errand:  Two such excellent men would be irreproachable judges..Thus he spoke; and scarce had he ended when entered the mother,  Holding her son by the hand, and so led him up to her husband..Some think only of pleasure and perishable apparel;  Others will cower at home, and behind the stove will sit brooding.		
"Not for ourselves is the suit, and 'tis delicate wooing for others.".she said: "I carry them better so balanced..He that has once beheld cities so cleanly and large, never after  Ceases his own native city, though small it may be, to embellish.		
All now must be other and tasteful,  So they call it; and white are the laths and benches of woodwork;  Everything simple and smooth; no carving longer or gilding  Can be endured, and the woods from abroad are of all the most costly..Modestly then did the son to the urgent father answer;  "Truly 'twas my wish too, as well as thine own, to have chosen  One of our neighbor's daughters, for we had been brought up together;  Played, in the early days, about the marketplace fountain;  And, from the other boys' rudeness, I often have been their defender..But when I look at the dwelling behind, where up in the gable  We can distinguish the window that marks my room in the attic;  When I look back, and remember how many a night from that window  I for the moon have watched; for the sun, how many a morning!		
Suffer me, then, to go hence wherever despair shall impel me:  Since by my father himself the decisive words have been spoken;  Since his house can no longer be mine if he shut out the maiden,  Her whom alone as my bride I desire to bring to our dwelling.".And I was vexed when I saw it,it wounded my pride; but more deeply  Felt I aggrieved that they the goodwill should so far misinterpret  That in my heart I bore them,especially Minna the youngest..Long since my house was smiling upon me in modish apparel!		
Go back!.we a maiden have here descried in the neighboring garden,  Under an appletree sitting, and making up garments for children  "Out of secondhand stuff that somebody doubtless has given;  And we were pleased with her aspect: she seems like a girl to be trusted..Greatly was courtesy valued among our neighbors the Frenchmen,  During their earlier days; it was common to noble and burgher,  As to the peasant, and every one made it the rule of his household.		
Tell us whatever thou knowest: we ask it with honest intentions.".As by the house we straightway can tell the mind of the master,  So, when we walk through a city, we judge of the persons who rule it..Hasten and show us in this a proof of the wisdom we honor."		
These had been lost, hitherto, from the sight of their sorrowing mother;  But in the midst of the crowd the old man now had descried them..would not comfort my sorrow..Yea, I could even believe I were speaking with Joshua or Moses."		
Out from the veil, now here and now there, with fiery flashes,  Gleaming over the field shot forth the ominous lightning..Gentle, he is; I am sure now his little excitement is over,  And he can feel how unjust his passion has made him to others..All such affairs were then conducted in regular fashion.		
Thou has pitied me often thyself; for much did I suffer,  Ever remembering with cordial respect the kindness of parents,  Solely intent on increasing for us their goods and possessions,  Much denying themselves in order to save for their children.."Tell us," the pastor returned, "what legerdemain he made use of.".Thereupon smiling the father replied: "Thus love I to hear thee!		
But I now am come hither to tell thee  What is their wish as mine.Forgive me my stammering language.".Besides we know that his wrath after dinner,  When he most hastily speaks, and questions all others' opinions,  Signifies naught; the full force of his violent will is excited  Then by the wine, which lets him not heed the language of others;  None but himself does he see and feel..And to her question made answer the good and intelligent Hermann:  "Ah, what wisdom thou showest, thou good, thou excellent maiden,  Asking thus first of all concerning the tastes of my parents!		
Eager and voluble then the women embraced Dorothea;  Hermann drew her away; but other adieus must be spoken:  Lastly the children with cries fell upon her and terrible weeping,  Clung to her garments, and would not their dear second mother should leave them..But that thou straightway the reason mayst know for which I am hither  Come to draw, where pure and unfailing the water is flowing,  This I must tell thee,that all the water we have in the village  Has by improvident people been troubled with horses and oxen  Wading direct through the source which brings the inhabitants water..But I was ever aware, and now my heart gives me assurance,  That till the hour appointed is come, and the maiden appointed  Shall with the hour appear, the choice will be left for the future,  While more strong than all else will be fear of grasping the wrong one.		
But who would look at it now!.CLIO THE AGE  Now when the foreign judge had been by the minister questioned  As to his people's distress, and how long their exile had lasted,  Thus made answer the man: "Of no recent date are our sorrows;  Since of the gathering bitter of years our people have drunken,  Bitterness all the more dreadful because such fair hope had been blighted..Quietly then, and with serious words, the son made him answer:  "If I have acted as ye will commend, I know not; but I followed  That which my heart bade me do, as I shall exactly relate you.		
And at the end of the city the flames began, and went coursing  Quickly along the streets, creating a draught in their passage..The father, however; in passion  After him called, "Yes, go, thou obstinate fellow!.Rather than ever today would I make up my mind to be married:  Many a worthy maiden is needing a husband's protection,  And the man needs an inspiriting wife when ill is impending."		
Yet thou appearest ill fitted for this, since already so deeply  Stung by the father's jests: whereas there is nothing more common  Than for a girl to be teased on account of a youth she may fancy.".Great are the panes in the windows; and how the glass sparkles and glitters,  Casting quite into the shade the rest of the marketplace houses!.Then with serious look the magistrate answered him, saying:  "Truly our times might well be compared with all others in strangeness,  Which are in history mentioned, profane or sacred tradition;  For who has yesterday lived and today in times like the present,  He has already lived years, events are so crowded together.		
how camest thou hither?".Both of the waterjars then in silence she took by the handle,  Carried them up the steps, while behind her followed her lover..Nay, I assure thee that never before have words such as these are  Freely dropped from my tongue, which is not accustomed to prattle;  But from out of my bosom thou lurest its every secret.		
Death cannot frighten the crowd: one multitude follows another..Thus he spoke and listened; for now was heard in the distance  Clattering of horses' hoofs drawing near, and the roll of the wagon,  Which, with furious haste, came thundering under the gateway..Arm and foot, besides, have been mightily strengthened by labor.		
"That will I gladly relate, for all may draw from it a lesson;"  So made the neighbor reply..No: man has need of patience, and needful to him are also  Calmness and clearness of mind, and a pure and right understanding..Cheerfully said in reply the excellent pastor, and kindly:  "Keep thyself firm in the faith, and firm abide in this temper;  For it makes steadfast and wise when fortune is fair, and when evil,  Furnishes sweet consolation and animates hopes the sublimest."		
Many the things I had done; but then the cost of such changes  Who does not fear, especially now in this season of danger?.Hark to me, mother: for I in the depths of my heart am determined  Quickly to do, and at once, what appears to me right and in reason;  For he chooses not always the best who longest considers..Genuine love matures in a moment the youth into manhood;  He is not easily moved; and I fear that if this be refused him,  Sadly his years will go by, those years that should be the fairest,"  Straightway then in a thoughtful tone the doctor made answer,  On whose tongue for a long time past the words had been trembling:  "Pray let us here as before pursue the safe middle course only.		
And in an instant my heart had decided, and quietly driving  After the maiden, I soon overtook her, and said to her quickly:  'Hearken, good maiden;my mother packed up not linenstuffs only  Into the carriage, that I should have clothes to furnish the naked;  Wine and beer she added besides, and supply of provisions:  Plenty of all these things I have in the box of the carriage..Little enough, it is true; but even that little is precious..Strange it was for her to seek him; he never had gone to a distance  That he told her not first, to spare his affectionate mother  Every anxious thought, and fear that aught ill had befallen.		
Thou, too, excellent man!".Men will always be hasty, their thoughts to extremes ever running:  Easily out of their course the hasty are turned by a hindrance..Then I rose hastily up, with a yearning the place to revisit  Whereon our dwelling had stood, and to see if the hens had been rescued,  Which I especially loved, for I still was a child in my feelings.		
Always majestic it seemed, and my mind and spirit exalted..For who acknowledges not, that since our dread conflagration,  When he so hardly chastised us, he now is continually blessing,  Constantly shielding, as man the apple of his eye watches over,  Holding it precious and dear above all the rest of his members?.Every one uses his own; in his own individual fashion,  Each must be happy and good.		
So they arose from their seats, and over the cornfields descended,  Through the luxuriant grain, enjoying the brightness of evening,  Until they came to the vineyard, and so entered into its shadow..with delight I perceive that my Hermann  Has the good taste of his father, who often showed his in his young days,  Leading out always the fairest to dance, and bringing the fairest  Finally home as his wife; our dear little mother here that was..Thereupon followed the war, and armed bodies of Frenchmen  Pressed to us nearer; yet nothing but friendship they seemed to be bringing;  Ay, and they brought it too; for exalted the spirit within them:  They with rejoicing the festive trees of liberty planted,  Promising every man what was his own, and to each his own ruling.		
E'en as far off as they then were, the doctor began to address him;  But they were presently nearer come and then the good pastor  Grasped his hand and exclaimed, interrupting the word of his comrade:  "Hail to thee, O young man!.On them without delay the shining bits he adjusted,  Hastily drew the straps through the buckles of beautiful plating,  Firmly fastened then the long broad reins, and the horses  Led without to the courtyard, whither the willing assistant  Had with ease, by the pole, already drawn forward the carriage..For who among us has means for paying the workpeople's wages  Lately I had an idea of giving the Archangel Michael,  Making the sign of my shop, another fresh coating of gilding,  And to the terrible dragon about his feet that is winding;  But I e'en let him stay browned as he is: I dreaded the charges."		
Denser soon grew the press..Rich is the man, I can tell thee..Let not man prattle of freedom, as if himself he could govern!		
Know that 'tis not as a lover that I have brought hither the maiden;  But she believes that as servant she comes to the house, and I tremble  Lest in displeasure she fly as soon as there's mention of marriage..But who can do as the merchant does, who, with his resources,  Knows the methods as well by which the best is arrived at?.A great part of the company had been delighted with this address, and the manner in which he delivered it, and seemed to approve of the notion; yet some couples looked at each other as if they thought that it would not answer their purpose: he therefore cried with humorous vehemence, "Truly!		
He indulged himself in a distorted aversion from his countrymen, and described with ludicrous touches even what they were able to undertake..As that of which I already knew the contents had now to be stuttered in a strange gibberish, in which a certain snuffle and gargle were not a little commended as something unattainable, I in a certain degree deviated from the matter, and diverted myself, in a childish way, with the singular names of these accumulated signs..The many affairs which were settled before the tribunal of the royal lieutenant had quite a peculiar charm, from his making it a point to accompany his decisions with some witty, ingenious, or lively turn.		
Two rivers out of four, the Euphrates and Tigris, still flowed in their beds..I pictured to myself so often and so circumstantially her condition and my own, and, as a contrast, the contented state of another couple in our company, that at last I could not forbear treating this situation dramatically, as a painful and instructive penance.."But you do not hit my weak side yet, interpreter.		
In pursuance of these principles, he employed for many years the whole of the Frankfort artists,the painter Hirt, who excelled in animating oak and beech woods, and other socalled rural scenes, with cattle; Trautmann, who had adopted Rembrandt as his model, and had attained great perfection in enclosed lights and reflections, as well as in effective conflagrations, so that he was once ordered to paint a companion piece to a Rembrandt; Schutz, who diligently elaborated landscapes of the Rhine country, in the manner of Sachtlebens; and Junker, who executed with great purity flower and fruit pieces, still life, and figures quietly employed, after the models of the Dutch..The harm which is done when young people at school are advanced too far in many things was afterwards manifested still more when time and attention were diverted from exercises in the languages, and a foundation in what are, properly speaking, preparatory studies, in order to be applied to what are called "Realities," which dissipate more than they cultivate, if they are not methodically and thoroughly taught..This threat I took in very ill part.		
But now all at once appeared a new army of little characters and signs, of points and strokes of all sorts, which were in fact to represent vowels..The erection, in so short a time, of so many booths, creating a new town within the old one; the roll and crush, the unloading and unpacking of wares,excited from the very first dawn of consciousness an insatiable active curiosity, and a boundless desire for childish property, which the boy with increasing years endeavored to gratify, in one way or another, as far as his little purse permitted..I did it with everincreasing facility, because it came by instinct, and no criticism had led me astray; and, if I did not feel full confidence in my productions, I could certainly regard them as defective, but not such as to be utterly rejected.		
The battle began: I ascended to the garret, where indeed I was prevented seeing the country round, but could very well hear the thunder of cannon and the general discharge of musketry..A BOY'S LEGEND..In the consciousness of his good intentions, and according to his way of thinking and the conception he had of himself, he believed that he deserved such a distinction, which, indeed, was not conformable to law or precedent.

Their house stood in the Friedberg Street, and appeared to have been formerly a fortress; for, on approaching it, nothing was seen but a large gate with battlements, which were joined on either side to the two neighboring houses..In rhetoric, composition, and such matters, no one excelled me; although I was often put back for faults of grammar..Grounded as I was in the Bible, all that was wanted was merely the faith to explain as divine that which I had hitherto esteemed in human fashion,a belief the easier for me, since I had made my first acquaintance with that book as a divine one.		
I saw one of the Palatine domestic officials, whom I asked whether he could not take me in with him..Therefore I jumped up; and as I saw the little host with its leader Achilles scattered around me, having been driven over with me by the rising of the rails, I seized the hero first, and threw him against a tree..Thus, what Von Loen had tried to do in respect to courtlife, he would have done for businesslife; introducing into it a more conscientious mode of proceeding.		
My grandfather had given me a free ticket, which I used daily, in spite of my father's reluctance, by dint of my mother's support..Such humorous acts of daring, brought on the theatre with wit and sense, are of the greatest effect..For him who felt any thing productive in himself it was a desperate condition.		
All who discharged the customary offices on such occasions rose against the innovation..Her eyes were not the finest I have ever seen, but the deepest, behind which you expected the most; and when they expressed any affection, any love, their brilliancy was unequalled..On this point, too, he had notions which referred, not only to the Bible, but also to "Gottfried's Chronicle;" and when we were agreed that I was to stay, I gave my purse, such as it was, into the charge of my hostess, and requested her to furnish herself from it, if any thing should be necessary.		
They drove out with me, entertained me at their country houses, and I seemed soon to recover..This is the epoch when that appeared which we know as light, and when that began which we are accustomed to designate by the word creation..This seemed to me to be well attained by great attention to the peculiarities of times and manners and of distinguished individuals.		
I, on my side, was likewise not particularly skilful in adapting myself to people..They wear blue mantles trimmed with gold, having the notes made fast to their sleeves, and their heads covered..These delightful experiences, preparing both mind and sense for true art, were nevertheless interrupted and damped by one of the most melancholy sights,by the destroyed and desolate condition of so many of the streets of Dresden through which I took my way.		
My mother, whose mediation always came in well for us, had endeavored to palliate my absence in the morning at breakfast, by the supposition that I had gone out early; and I experienced no disagreeable effects from this innocent night..But his career was short; for he soon died, and was gradually forgotten as a restless, irregular youth.."What would he say, then?"		
One Saturday evening in winter,my father always had himself shaved over night, that on Sunday morning he might dress for church at his ease,we sat on a footstool behind the stove, and muttered our customary imprecations in a tolerably low voice, while the barber was putting on the lather..Gates and towers, which defined the bounds of the old city,then, farther on again, gates, towers, walls, bridges, ramparts, moats, with which the new city was encompassed,all showed, but too plainly, that a necessity for guarding the common weal in disastrous times had induced these arrangements, that all the squares and streets, even the newest, broadest, and best laid out, owed their origin to chance and caprice, and not to any regulating mind..Between the two arises a sad conflict, in which young minds are dragged hither and thither, and which can scarcely be set right by the middle aged professors, who, though possessed of sufficient learning and culture, always feel within themselves an active desire for knowledge and reflection.		
Do you see these three apples?"."Out with you!no one but St. Jean has a right to enter here.".To excite and strengthen our faith in the possibility of such an universal remedy, the physician, wherever he found any susceptibility, had recommended certain chemicoalchemical books to his patients, and given them to understand, that, by one's own study of them, one could well attain this treasure for one's self, which was the more necessary, as the mode of its preparation, both for physical, and especially for moral, reasons, could not be well communicated; nay, that in order to comprehend, produce, and use this great work, one must know the secrets of nature in connection, since it was not a particular, but an universal remedy, and could indeed be produced under different forms and shapes.		
After a short, insignificant conversation, my young comrade, who was but too well disposed towards me, could not suffer the matter to drop, without saying to the other, with some resentment, "Here is my friend who made those pretty verses, for which you will not give him credit!".This singular man I found to be mild and obliging when I began to take lessons of him..Unfortunately he did not stand on the best footing with those who cultivated them; and Gellert in particular, in whom I had, awkwardly enough, expressed much confidence, he could not even endure.		
At that time, there was a Schöff von Uffenbach, who was generally respected..Their manner of life upon the ocean of deserts and pastures gave breadth and freedom to their minds; the vault of heaven, under which they dwelt, with all its nightly stars, elevated their feelings; and they, more than the active, skilful huntsman, or the secure, careful, householding husbandman, had need of the immovable faith that a God walked beside them, visited them, cared for them, guided and saved them..I took the volume, he let me read, turned over his Lucian; and, when I made any remarks on the book, his ordinary laugh was the only answer to my sagacity.

To a sufferer, to one who felt himself delicate, nay, weak, the gospel was therefore welcome; and even though Langer, with all his faith, was at the same time a very sensible man, and firmly maintained that one should not let the feelings prevail, should not let one's self be led astray into mysticism, I could not have managed to occupy myself with the New Testament without feeling and enthusiasm..I was now resolved, contrary to his views and wishes, to choose a line of studies and of life for myself, by way of selfdefense..Now an opportunity was offered me to show myself, and especially to see myself in print.		
The historical portions of this book I diligently read in my youth..Both the abovementioned pieces were, however, written from a more elevated point of view, without my having been aware of it..He liked to employ himself in writing better than in any thing else, and was pleased when something was given him to copy; but still more when he was dictated to, because he then felt carried back to his happy academical years.		
Sometimes I tore them up again, from the fear of learning my unhappiness quite distinctly, and of losing the principal consolation with which hitherto I had alternately tormented and supported myself..However, when I returned to the company, and the wine was not spared, the poem began to halt; and I could not deliver it that evening..One would have liked to be there too; as indeed, on this day, it would hare been altogether desirable to multiply one's self.		
To the physicians this cause was plausible, and very soon certain on my leaving my etching and biting, and that so much the more readily as the attempt had by no means turned out well, and I had more reason to conceal than to exhibit my labors; for which I consoled myself the more easily, as I very soon saw myself free from the troublesome disease..Now it was the turn of the hereditary cup bearer, who rode to the fountain and fetched wine..Since he designed his composition less with regard to form than to light, shade, and masses, the general effect was good; as indeed all that he did and produced was attended by a peculiar grace.		
But the form spoiled almost every thing..The old had themselves still childish notions, and found it convenient to impart their own education to their successors..The ridingmasters, the led horses, the equipages, the shabracks and caparisons, attracted every eye; and the sixteen sixhorse galawagons of the imperial chamberlains, privy councillors, high chamberlain, high stewards, and high equerry, closed, with great pomp, this division of the procession, which, in spite of its magnificence and extent, was still only to be the vanguard.		
I consequently read much in this language, with great ease, and was bold enough to believe I understood the authors, because I missed nothing of the literal sense..They gave to the Eternal Being the faculty of expansion, of moving towards them: the peculiar pulse of life was again restored, and Lucifer himself could not avoid its effects..Her little housekeeping was soon provided for.		
Yet all would have been well enough, if by signing that poetical loveletter, in which she had confessed a formal attachment to me, she had not given me a right to regard her as a sly and selfish coquette..It may be imagined how often I got into disputes on this subject with my friend, which, however, always terminated in the friendliest way, and often, like my conversations with the old rector, with the remark, "that I was a foolish fellow, for whom many allowances must be made.".My hair had been frizzled and powdered, and my curls stuck out from my head like little wings; but I could not finish dressing myself, because I kept confusing the different articles, the first always falling off as soon as I was about to put on the next.		
We had driven out through the Allerheiligen (/All Saints/) gate, and had soon left Hanau behind us, after which we reached scenes which aroused my attention by their novelty, if, at this season of the year, they offered little that was pleasing..Soon he takes a side, as his character or external circumstances may determine..In a large, rich city, there are many modes of gaining a livelihood.		
Considering this impulse more closely, we may see in it that presumption with which the poet authoritatively utters the greatest improbabilities, and requires every one to recognize as real whatever may in any way seem to him, the inventor, as true..The sacraments are the highest part of religion, the symbols to our senses of an extraordinary divine favor and grace..he exclaimed.		
Von Loen rejoined; the contest grew violent and personal, and the unpleasantness which arose from it caused him to accept the office of president at Lingen, which Frederick II..She was holding a rye loaf in her hand, and was cutting slices for the little ones all around, in proportion to their age and appetite..You abhor the drunken man, and detest the extravagant; you pass by, like the Levite, and thank God, like the Pharisee, that you are not like one of them.		
(We feel obliged to suppress the passage in the letter, to prevent any one from feeling aggrieved; although no author need pay much attention to the opinion of a mere girl, or that of an unsteady young man.).I knew I could make no pretensions to her, nor did I offer any, that is, as far as it was possible, in the presence of so much loveliness, not to pant for its enjoyment..OCTOBER 27: Evening.		
As I was walking up and down his room, my eye fell upon his pistols..In the meantime, Charlotte was in a pitiable state of mind..My dear friend, the bare recollection of those hours still consoles me.		
He alluded to his unfortunate attachment, and wished it were possible to discontinue his acquaintance.."But he eats out of my mouth," she continued, and extended her lips to him containing seed; and she smiled with all the charm of a being who has allowed an innocent participation of her love..But it does not produce the same effect upon me.		
it is Daura who calleth thee..Charlotte and her partner began an English country dance, and you must imagine my delight when it was their turn to dance the figure with us..Think, whilst you peruse this plain narration, what an impression the circumstance has made upon me!		
As I anticipated, the ambassador occasions me infinite annoyance..The stream and the wind roar aloud..Theft is a crime; but the man who commits it from extreme poverty, with no design but to save his family from perishing, is he an object of pity, or of punishment?

Call it folly or infatuation, what signifies a name?.one for papa, and another for Albert and Charlotte, and one for Werther; and they were to be presented early in the morning, on New Year's Day..Oh, from the rock on the hill, from the top of the windy steep, speak, ye ghosts of the dead!		
Colgar the valiant lives, and Annira, fairest maid..Here used I to sit for hours together with my eyes bent upon them, ardently longing to wander in the shade of those woods, to lose myself in those valleys, which form so delightful an object in the distance..I have just had a sad adventure, which will drive me away from here.		
Sometimes I am disposed to believe them honest, and yet I cannot persuade myself to confide in them..I was thunderstruck: I placed a piece of money in her hand, and hastened away..Finding that all the parish, particularly the old people, were displeased, I asked "why they allowed it?"		
The affection and simplicity with which this was uttered so charmed me, that I sought to express my feelings by catching up the child and kissing her heartily..and then might not rapture perchance be the portion of this liberated soul?."The count," he said, "is a man of the world, and a good man of business: his style is good, and he writes with facility; but, like other geniuses, he has no solid learning."		
"Charlotte!".The foaming torrents rolled from the mountains in the moonlight,fields and meadows, trees and hedges, were confounded together; and the entire valley was converted into a deep lake, which was agitated by the roaring wind!.Her little sister was dressing her doll upon my lap.		
I often envy Albert when I see him buried in a heap of papers and parchments, and I fancy I should be happy were I in his place..why complainest thou, as a blast in the wood as a wave on the lonely shore?.Jane at the moment approached with the glass.		
AUGUST 28.."This speech," replied Werther with a cold smile, "this speech should be printed, for the benefit of all teachers..Her heart beat audiblywe could almost say for the first timeat his arrival.		
The boat is broken in twain..A recollection of many things which had happened pressed upon my mind, and filled my eyes with tears..then the noble Albert, who never disturbs my happiness by any appearance of illhumour, receiving me with the heartiest affection, and loving me, next to Charlotte, better than all the world!

Wherever I go, some fatality occurs to distract me..I met him yesterday on the road, going to a neighbouring village..He heard their strife on the hill: their song was soft, but sad!		
She was playing upon her piano a succession of delightful melodies, with such intense expression!.Farewell!.I meet this bard with silver hair; he wanders in the valley; he seeks the footsteps of his fathers, and, alas!		
I had spent half an hour struggling between the contending thoughts of going and returning, when I heard them coming up the terrace..Last night, and this morning, Werther, I was compelled to listen to a lecture upon my acquaintance with you..But thou dost smile and depart.		
A dim vastness is spread before our souls: the perceptions of our mind are as obscure as those of our vision; and we desire earnestly to surrender up our whole being, that it may be filled with the complete and perfect bliss of one glorious emotion..Werther started..Charlotte looked at me with a smile; she observed the emotion with which I spoke: and a tear in the eyes of Frederica stimulated me to proceed.		
This is a glorious summer..Loud was the wind; the rain beat hard on the hill..Speak, I will not be afraid!		
Oh, the brilliant wretchedness, the weariness, that one is doomed to witness among the silly people whom we meet in society here!.If I sometimes invent an incident which I forget upon the next narration, they remind one directly that the story was different before; so that I now endeavour to relate with exactness the same anecdote in the same monotonous tone, which never changes..when we have attained our object, when the distant there becomes the present here, all is changed: we are as poor and circumscribed as ever, and our souls still languish for unattainable happiness.		
AUGUST 30..To hear all this, Wilhelm, uttered by her in a voice of the most sincere sympathy, awakened all my passions; and I am still in a state of extreme excitement..I was silent.		
Happy mortal, who can ascribe your wretchedness to an earthly cause!.Thus did she express herself; but O Wilhelm!.The sight of his blood might possibly be a relief to my fury.		
He threw down the book, seized her hand, and wept bitterly..His soul was like the soul of Fingal: his sword like the sword of Oscar.."Poor boy!"		
Albert is not the man to satisfy the wishes of such a heart..I threw myself at her feet, and, seizing her hand, bedewed it with a thousand tears..Alpin, thou son of song, why alone on the silent hill?
