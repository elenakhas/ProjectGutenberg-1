these	passages	are	comparable	to	the	best	bombast	of	kyd	or	marlowe	with	a	greater	command	of	language	and	a	greater	control	of	the	emotion	so	with	blake	his	early	poems	are	technically	admirable	and	their	originality	is	in	an	occasional	rhythm	the	beauty	of	swinburne	’s	verse	is	the	sound	people	say	explaining	he	had	little	visual	imagination	i	am	inclined	to	think	that	the	word	beauty	is	hardly	to	be	used	in	connection	with	swinburne	’s	verse	at	all	but	in	any	case	the	beauty	or	effect	of	sound	is	neither	that	of	music	nor	that	of	poetry	which	can	be	set	to	music		
the	hamlet	of	laforgue	is	an	adolescent	the	hamlet	of	shakespeare	is	not	he	has	not	that	explanation	and	excuse	i	do	not	propose	to	analyse	the	difference	it	would	be	a	valuable	chapter	in	social	history	the	american	solemnity	it	is	enough	to	say	is	more	primitive	more	academic	more	like	that	of	the	german	professor	but	having	dealt	with	three	english	writers	of	what	may	be	called	critical	prose	one	’s	mind	becomes	conscious	of	the	fact	that	they	have	something	in	common	and	trying	to	perceive	more	clearly	what	this	community	is	and	suspecting	that	it	is	a	national	quality	one	is	impelled	to	meditate	upon	the	strongest	contrast	possible		
none	of	the	obvious	complaints	that	were	or	might	have	been	brought	to	bear	upon	the	first	poems	and	ballads	holds	good	the	alteration	is	not	complete	enough	however	to	be	convincing	you	can	not	point	to	it	in	the	speeches	indeed	if	you	examine	the	two	famous	soliloquies	you	see	the	versification	of	shakespeare	but	a	content	which	might	be	claimed	by	another	perhaps	by	the	author	of	the	revenge	of	bussy	d’ambois	act	v.	sc		
in	sentimental	drama	it	appears	in	a	degraded	form	when	we	are	evidently	intended	to	accept	the	character	’s	sentimental	interpretation	of	himself	and	if	literature	is	to	swinburne	merely	a	passion	we	are	tempted	to	say	that	to	george	wyndham	it	was	a	hobby	and	to	mr.	whibley	almost	a	charming	showman	’s	show	we	are	charmed	by	the	urbanity	of	the	showman)	to	have	held	the	centre	of	the	stage	for	two	hours	in	a	rôle	which	requires	both	extreme	violence	and	restraint	a	rôle	which	requires	simple	force	and	subtle	variation	to	have	sustained	so	difficult	a	rôle	almost	without	support	this	was	a	legitimate	success		
swinburne	’s	words	must	always	be	referred	back	to	swinburne	himself	but	from	passages	like	the	first	we	may	be	permitted	to	infer	that	massinger	was	unconscious	of	trying	to	develop	a	different	kind	of	character	from	any	that	marlowe	or	jonson	had	invented	these	poets	were	certainly	obliged	to	consume	vast	energy	in	this	pursuit	of	form	which	could	never	lead	to	a	wholly	satisfying	result		
and	we	have	named	three	of	massinger	’s	best	in	order	to	fit	into	our	estimate	of	massinger	the	two	admirable	comedies	a	new	way	to	pay	old	debts	and	the	city	madam	a	more	extensive	research	would	be	required	than	is	possible	within	our	limits	but	such	a	nature	was	not	at	hand	and	massinger	precedes	not	another	shakespeare	but	milton		
blake	’s	poetry	has	the	unpleasantness	of	great	poetry	wyndham	was	a	romantic	the	only	cure	for	romanticism	is	to	analyse	it	the	point	of	view	which	i	am	struggling	to	attack	is	perhaps	related	to	the	metaphysical	theory	of	the	substantial	unity	of	the	soul	for	my	meaning	is	that	the	poet	has	not	a	personality	to	express	but	a	particular	medium	which	is	only	a	medium	and	not	a	personality	in	which	impressions	and	experiences	combine	in	peculiar	and	unexpected	ways		
the	critics	of	the	romantic	period	were	pioneers	and	exhibit	the	fallibility	of	discoverers	if	you	examine	any	of	shakespeare	’s	more	successful	tragedies	you	will	find	this	exact	equivalence	you	will	find	that	the	state	of	mind	of	lady	macbeth	walking	in	her	sleep	has	been	communicated	to	you	by	a	skilful	accumulation	of	imagined	sensory	impressions	the	words	of	macbeth	on	hearing	of	his	wife	’s	death	strike	us	as	if	given	the	sequence	of	events	these	words	were	automatically	released	by	the	last	event	in	the	series	it	employed	all	the	conventions	the	theatricalities	of	the	modern	stage	yet	her	personality	triumphed	over	not	only	professor	murray	’s	verse	but	her	own	training		
critics	are	often	interested	but	not	quite	in	the	nominal	subject	often	in	something	a	little	beside	the	point	they	are	often	learned	but	not	quite	to	the	point	either	there	are	some	poets	whose	every	line	has	unique	value	i’m	not	taken	    	with	a	cobswan	or	a	highmounting	bull	    	as	foolish	leda	and	europa	were	    	but	the	bright	gold	with	danaë		
tennyson	dora	in	faustus	marlowe	went	farther	he	broke	up	the	line	to	a	gain	in	intensity	in	the	last	soliloquy	and	he	developed	a	new	and	important	conversational	tone	in	the	dialogues	of	faustus	with	the	devil	if	you	look	at	catiline	that	dreary	pyrrhic	victory	of	tragedy	you	find	two	passages	to	be	successful	act	ii	we	need	some	one	not	a	member	of	the	church	of	rome	and	perhaps	preferably	not	a	member	of	the	church	of	england	to	explain	how	vital	a	matter	it	is	if	aristotle	may	be	said	to	have	been	a	moral	pilot	of	europe	whether	we	shall	or	shall	not	drop	that	pilot		
this	leads	us	to	the	question	of	humours	does	the	silkworm	expend	her	yellow	labours	    	for	thee?.the	bad	poet	dwells	partly	in	a	world	of	objects	and	partly	in	a	world	of	words	and	he	never	can	get	them	to	fit		
m.	julien	benda	has	the	formal	beauty	which	the	american	critics	lack	and	a	close	affinity	to	them	in	point	of	view	and	it	appears	to	be	satire	for	one	thing	the	stage	appeals	to	too	many	demands	besides	the	demand	for	art	for	that	to	be	possible	and	also	we	need	unfortunately	something	more	than	refined	automatons		
but	at	this	point	the	impression	is	emotional	the	reader	in	the	ignorance	which	we	postulate	is	unable	to	distinguish	the	poetry	from	an	emotional	state	aroused	in	himself	by	the	poetry	a	state	which	may	be	merely	an	indulgence	of	his	own	emotions	this	impression	may	be	so	deep	that	no	subsequent	study	and	understanding	will	intensify	it	it	is	pertinent	at	least	to	remark	that	marlowe	’s	rhetoric	is	not	or	not	characteristically	shakespeare	’s	rhetoric	that	marlowe	’s	rhetoric	consists	in	a	pretty	simple	huffesnuffe	bombast	while	shakespeare	’s	is	more	exactly	a	vice	of	style	a	tortured	perverse	ingenuity	of	images	which	dissipates	instead	of	concentrating	the	imagination	and	which	may	be	due	in	part	to	influences	by	which	marlowe	was	untouched		
or	to	professor	bradley?.from	the	point	of	view	of	literature	the	drama	is	only	one	among	several	poetic	forms	massinger	and	now	in	the	evening	            	when	thou	shoud'st	pass	with	honour	to	thy	rest	            	wilt	thou	fall	like	a	meteor		
largely	on	the	evidence	of	the	two	humour	plays	it	is	sometimes	assumed	that	jonson	is	occupied	with	types	typical	exaggerations	or	exaggerations	of	type	the	french	intelligence	as	the	inspection	of	types	of	english	irresistibly	provoked	a	glance	at	two	american	critics	so	the	inspection	of	the	latter	leads	our	attention	to	the	french	but	almost	no	one	today	will	wish	to	read	the	whole	of	swinburne		
when	it	is	a	matter	of	pronouncing	judgment	between	two	poets	swinburne	is	almost	unerring	but	satire	like	jonson	’s	is	great	in	the	end	not	by	hitting	off	its	object	but	by	creating	it	the	satire	is	merely	the	means	which	leads	to	the	æsthetic	result	the	impulse	which	projects	a	new	world	into	a	new	orbit	and	the	superb	additions	to	hieronimo.”[7	footnote	7	  	of	the	authorship	it	can	only	be	said	that	the	lines	are	by	some	  	admirer	of	marlowe		
it	is	strange	that	swinburne	should	have	hinted	at	a	similarity	to	jonson	and	not	mentioned	a	far	more	striking	affinity	of	chapman’s	that	is	donne	he	lived	in	no	fairyland	but	his	mind	went	out	and	became	a	part	of	things	here	in	fact	is	our	text	to	elucidate	this	sentence	would	be	to	account	for	massinger		
this	is	really	a	point	of	capital	importance	he	exercises	neither	of	the	tools	of	the	critic	comparison	and	analysis	the	scene	in	julius	cæsar	is	right	because	the	object	of	our	attention	is	not	the	speech	of	antony	bedeutung	but	the	effect	of	his	speech	upon	the	mob	and	antony	’s	intention	his	preparation	and	consciousness	of	the	effect		
we	think	of	shakespeare	perhaps	as	the	dramatist	who	concentrates	everything	into	a	sentence	pray	you	undo	this	button	or	honest	honest	iago	we	forget	that	there	is	a	rhetoric	proper	to	shakespeare	at	his	best	period	which	is	quite	free	from	the	genuine	shakespearean	vices	either	of	the	early	period	or	the	late	the	ability	to	perform	that	slight	distortion	of	all	the	elements	in	the	world	of	a	play	or	a	story	so	that	this	world	is	complete	in	itself	which	was	given	to	marlowe	and	jonson	and	to	rabelais	and	which	is	prerequisite	to	great	farce	was	denied	to	massinger	and	we	do	not	quite	say	that	the	new	is	more	valuable	because	it	fits	in	but	its	fitting	in	is	a	test	of	its	value	a	test	it	is	true	which	can	only	be	slowly	and	cautiously	applied	for	we	are	none	of	us	infallible	judges	of	conformity		
in	the	agamemnon	the	artistic	emotion	approximates	to	the	emotion	of	an	actual	spectator	in	othello	to	the	emotion	of	the	protagonist	himself	as	for	the	last	alternative	it	is	not	to	be	entertained	as	for	the	second	what	type	do	we	prefer?.and	as	it	recalls	other	scenes	there	is	a	suggestion	of	the	college	of	ladies	in	the	silent	woman	it	looks	like	a	comedy	scene		
and	it	is	at	the	same	time	what	makes	a	writer	most	acutely	conscious	of	his	place	in	time	of	his	contemporaneity	there	remains	to	define	this	process	of	depersonalization	and	its	relation	to	the	sense	of	tradition	and	as	in	france	so	in	england	the	more	farcical	comedy	was	the	more	serious		
such	men	as	tylor	and	robertson	smith	and	wilhelm	wundt	who	early	fertilized	the	soil	would	hardly	recognize	the	resulting	vegetation	and	indeed	poor	wundt	’s	völkerpsychologie	was	a	musty	relic	before	it	was	translated	or	he	might	have	studied	through	the	literature	to	the	mind	of	that	century	he	might	by	dissection	and	analysis	have	helped	us	to	some	insight	into	the	feeling	and	thought	which	we	seem	to	have	left	so	far	away	the	usual	conclusion	is	either	that	conditions	are	too	much	for	us	or	that	we	really	prefer	other	types	of	literature	or	simply	that	we	are	uninspired		
the	verse	of	edward	iii	deserves	study	shakespeare	’tis	in	my	memory	locked	              	and	you	yourself	shall	keep	the	key	of	it	the	meanings	which	it	has	been	obliged	to	shoulder	have	been	mostly	opprobrious	but	if	a	precise	meaning	can	be	found	for	it	this	meaning	may	occasionally	represent	a	virtue		
5	footnote	5	  	i	should	except	the	dynasts	but	at	least	marlowe	has	in	a	few	words	concentrated	him	into	a	statement	one	is	by	isolating	the	essential	by	pointing	out	the	most	intense	in	various	kinds	and	separating	it	from	the	accidents	of	environment		
the	words	fall	with	as	determined	beat	as	if	they	were	the	will	of	the	morose	dictator	himself	in	the	indefinable	touches	which	make	up	the	music	of	a	verse	says	    	boyle	in	the	artistic	distribution	of	pauses	and	in	the	unerring	    	choice	and	grouping	of	just	those	words	which	strike	the	ear	as	the	    	perfection	of	harmony	there	are	if	we	leave	cyril	tourneur	’s	    	atheist	’s	tragedy	out	of	the	question	only	two	masters	in	the	    	drama	shakespeare	in	his	latest	period	and	massinger	and	you	may	say	rhetoric	but	if	we	are	to	call	it	rhetoric	we	must	subject	that	term	to	a	closer	dissection	than	any	to	which	it	is	accustomed		
if	then	we	must	be	very	careful	in	applying	terms	of	censure	like	diffuse	we	must	be	equally	careful	of	praise	there	are	others	who	need	be	read	only	in	selections	but	what	selections	are	read	will	not	very	much	matter	the	inferiority	of	massinger	to	jonson	is	an	inferiority	not	of	one	type	of	art	to	another	but	within	jonson	’s	type		
there	is	strength	and	energy	at	least	in	marlowe	’s	amores	but	we	can	not	believe	that	george	wyndham	lived	in	the	real	world	in	the	earlier	drama	these	conventions	are	merely	a	framework	or	an	alloy	necessary	for	working	the	metal	the	metal	itself	consisted	of	unique	emotions	resulting	inevitably	from	the	circumstances	resulting	or	inhering	as	inevitably	as	the	properties	of	a	chemical	compound
