the	theme	of	their	ballads	consists	of	shepherds	love	flocks	and	the	sons	of	kings	who	fall	in	love	with	beautiful	shepherdesses	we	gathered	roses	on	the	terrace	in	the	feeling	that	they	might	be	the	posterity	of	some	planted	by	julia	's	hand	switzerland		
the	lake	is	at	our	feet	and	a	little	harbour	contains	our	boat	in	which	we	still	enjoy	our	evening	excursions	on	the	water	which	we	possessed	was	all	the	money	that	we	could	count	upon	with	any	certainty	until	the	following	december	why	did	the	cold	maxims	of	the	world	compel	me	at	this	moment	to	repress	the	tears	of	melancholy	transport	which	it	would	have	been	so	sweet	to	indulge	immeasurably	even	until	the	darkness	of	night	had	swallowed	up	the	objects	which	excited	them		
his	countenance	was	beautiful	for	the	expression	with	which	it	overflowed	they	were	created	indeed	by	one	mind	but	a	mind	so	powerfully	bright	as	to	cast	a	shade	of	falsehood	on	the	records	that	are	called	reality	on	quitting	the	walls	the	road	wound	underneath	a	high	precipice	on	the	other	side	the	hills	rose	more	gradually	and	the	green	valley	that	intervened	between	them	was	watered	by	a	pleasant	river	before	us	arose	an	amphitheatre	of	hills	covered	with	vines	but	irregular	and	rocky		
we	were	travelling	along	the	valley	when	suddenly	we	heard	a	sound	as	of	the	burst	of	smothered	thunder	rolling	above	yet	there	was	something	earthly	in	the	sound	that	told	us	it	could	not	be	thunder	before	we	slept	we	secured	places	in	the	diligence	which	was	to	depart	next	morning	for	clêves	one	had	fallen	the	preceding	day	a	little	time	after	we	had	returned	our	guides	desired	us	to	pass	quickly	for	it	is	said	that	sometimes	the	least	sound	will	accelerate	their	descent

we	passed	through	the	champain	country	which	extends	from	mont	salève	to	the	base	of	the	higher	alps	you	know	that	we	have	just	escaped	from	the	gloom	of	winter	and	of	london	and	coming	to	this	delightful	spot	during	this	divine	weather	i	feel	as	happy	as	a	newfledged	bird	and	hardly	care	what	twig	i	fly	to	so	that	i	may	try	my	newfound	wings	the	road	lay	over	a	desart	plain	and	as	night	advanced	we	were	often	in	danger	of	losing	the	track	of	wheels	which	was	our	only	guide

we	had	not	proceeded	far	before	the	rain	began	to	fall	but	we	persisted	until	we	had	accomplished	more	than	half	of	our	journey	when	we	returned	wet	through	one	winter	night	an	avalanche	overwhelmed	them	but	their	plaintive	voices	are	still	heard	in	stormy	nights	calling	for	succour	from	the	peasants	waterfalls	echo	from	the	cliffs	and	shine	afar		
probably	the	village	derives	its	name	from	this	production	water	conveyances	are	always	the	cheapest	and	fortunately	we	were	so	situated	that	by	taking	advantage	of	the	rivers	of	the	reuss	and	rhine	we	could	reach	england	without	travelling	a	league	on	land	i	never	felt	more	strongly	than	on	landing	at	clarens	that	the	spirit	of	old	times	had	deserted	its	once	cherished	habitation

it	was	evening	and	the	laden	clouds	made	the	darkness	almost	as	deep	as	that	of	midnight	but	in	the	west	an	unusually	brilliant	and	fiery	redness	occupied	an	opening	in	the	vapours	and	added	to	the	interest	of	our	little	expedition	the	cottage	lights	were	reflected	in	the	tranquil	river	and	the	dark	hills	behind	dimly	seen	resembled	vast	and	frowning	mountains	these	prisons	are	excavated	below	the	lake	the	principal	dungeon	is	supported	by	seven	columns	whose	branching	capitals	support	the	roof	nothing	could	be	more	barren	and	wretched	than	the	track	through	which	we	now	passed	the	ground	was	chalky	and	uncovered	even	by	grass	and	where	there	had	been	any	attempts	made	towards	cultivation	the	straggling	ears	of	corn	discovered	more	plainly	the	barren	nature	of	the	soil		
after	having	travelled	for	two	days	through	a	country	perfectly	without	interest	it	was	a	delicious	relief	for	the	eye	to	dwell	again	on	some	irregularities	and	beauty	of	country	from	the	windows	of	our	hotel	we	see	the	lovely	lake	blue	as	the	heavens	which	it	reflects	and	sparkling	with	golden	beams	this	approach	to	mountain	scenery	filled	us	with	delight	it	was	otherwise	with	our	voiturier	he	came	from	the	plains	of	troyes	and	these	hills	so	utterly	scared	him	that	he	in	some	degree	lost	his	reason

the	mountains	of	this	beautiful	ravine	are	so	little	asunder	that	in	time	of	war	with	france	an	iron	chain	is	thrown	across	it	this	conveyance	appeared	much	more	like	a	mercantile	english	affair	than	any	we	had	before	seen	it	was	shaped	like	a	steamboat	with	a	cabin	and	a	high	deck	having	formed	this	resolution	we	had	not	a	moment	for	delay	our	little	store	was	sensibly	decreasing	and	£	28

the	last	gate	of	the	town	was	cut	through	the	precipitous	rock	that	arose	on	one	side	and	in	that	place	jutted	into	the	road	we	dined	at	servoz	a	little	village	where	there	are	lead	and	copper	mines	and	where	we	saw	a	cabinet	of	natural	curiosities	like	those	of	keswick	and	bethgelert	there	were	only	four	passengers	besides	ourselves	three	of	these	were	students	of	the	strasburgh	university	schwitz	a	rather	handsome	good	tempered	young	man	hoff	a	kind	of	shapeless	animal	with	a	heavy	ugly	german	face	and	schneider	who	was	nearly	an	ideot	and	on	whom	his	companions	were	always	playing	a	thousand	tricks	the	remaining	passengers	were	a	woman	and	an	infant
