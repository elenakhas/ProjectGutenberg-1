thus	it	appears	that	though	the	thoughts	of	men	had	widened	in	those	closing	days	of	the	eighteenth	century	to	include	the	stars	they	had	not	as	yet	expanded	to	receive	the	most	patent	records	that	are	written	everywhere	on	the	surface	of	the	earth	here	however	even	more	appropriate	than	in	the	other	casemore	's	the	pitywould	have	been	the	application	of	his	qualifying	clause	but	that	happeneth	rarely.".it	never	whirls	in	concentric	circles	it	always	either	rushes	in	towards	the	centre	in	a	descending	spiral	in	which	case	it	is	called	a	cyclone	or	it	spreads	out	from	the	centre	in	a	widening	spiral	in	which	case	it	is	called	an	anticyclone		
the	increase	of	speed	was	equally	well	marked	and	was	a	direct	result	of	the	gradual	formation	of	the	limbs	indeed	as	so	often	happens	in	fields	of	discovery	two	other	workers	had	almost	simultaneously	solved	the	same	problemstruve	at	pulkowa	where	the	great	russian	observatory	which	so	long	held	the	palm	over	all	others	had	now	been	established	and	thomas	henderson	then	working	at	the	cape	of	good	hope	but	afterwards	the	astronomer	royal	of	scotland	the	physicist	could	think	of	but	one	way	they	must	assume	that	the	ether	is	incompressible

there	is	no	sure	test	available	by	which	it	could	be	shown	that	the	devonian	age	for	instance	as	outlined	in	the	strata	of	europe	did	not	begin	millions	of	years	earlier	or	later	than	the	period	whose	records	are	said	to	represent	the	devonian	age	in	america	when	faraday	wrote	those	words	in	1840	he	was	treading	on	the	very	heels	of	a	greater	generalization	than	any	which	he	actually	formulated	nay	he	had	it	fairly	within	his	reach	the	suspended	substances	will	have	been	all	the	lighter	and	finer	particles	of	the	upper	beds	where	the	disintegration	had	been	extreme	and	particularly	their	mica	which	owing	to	the	tenuity	of	its	plateshaped	crystals	would	be	most	readily	carried	up	by	the	ascending	fluid	and	will	have	remained	longest	in	suspension		
all	the	phenomena	of	chemical	decomposition	were	produced	with	intense	rapidity	by	this	combination	but	of	course	the	uniformitarian	faith	permitted	no	such	explanation	nor	could	it	countenance	the	projection	idea	so	lyell	was	bound	to	find	some	other	means	of	transportation	for	the	puzzling	erratics	the	linking	of	nebulae	with	stars	so	clearly	evidenced	by	all	these	modern	observations	is	after	all	only	the	scientific	corroboration	of	what	the	elder	herschel	's	later	theories	affirmed		
in	1840	agassiz	published	a	paper	in	which	the	results	of	his	alpine	studies	were	elaborated	it	is	generally	held	that	the	first	choice	lies	between	joule	and	mayer	the	effect	of	the	raised	weight	is	therefore	also	a	force	or	expressed	in	a	more	general	form	separation	in	space	of	ponderable	objects	is	a	force	and	since	this	force	causes	the	fall	of	bodies	we	call	it	falling	force		
his	discovery	was	consummated	in	the	early	days	of	the	nineteenth	century	when	he	brought	forward	the	first	conclusive	proofs	of	the	undulatory	theory	of	light	the	share	of	lagrange	was	hardly	less	than	that	of	his	coworker	but	laplace	will	longer	be	remembered	because	he	ultimately	brought	his	completed	labors	into	a	system	and	incorporating	with	them	the	labors	of	his	contemporaries	produced	in	the	mecanique	celeste	the	undisputed	mathematical	monument	of	the	century	a	fitting	complement	to	the	principia	of	newton	which	it	supplements	and	in	a	sense	completes	pioneer	work	in	celestial	photography	was	indeed	done	by	arago	in	france	and	by	the	elder	draper	in	america	in	1839	but	the	results	then	achieved	were	only	tentative	and	it	was	not	till	forty	years	later	that	the	method	assumed	really	important	proportions		
there	was	nothing	haphazard	nothing	accidental	about	this	it	bore	the	stamp	of	unalterable	law	yet	one	and	all	so	distant	are	they	remain	mere	disklike	points	of	light	before	the	utmost	powers	of	the	modern	telescope	in	its	place	lyell	put	forward	a	modified	hypothesis	of	special	creation		
all	these	arrangements	being	made	the	copper	disk	was	adjusted	the	small	magnetic	poles	being	about	onehalf	an	inch	apart	and	the	edge	of	the	plate	inserted	about	half	their	width	between	them	out	of	them	also	grew	in	the	mind	of	one	of	the	investigators	a	new	generalization	only	second	in	importance	to	the	doctrine	of	conservation	itself	but	while	all	these	affinities	seemed	so	clear	to	the	great	coordinating	brain	of	young	they	made	no	such	impression	on	the	minds	of	his	contemporaries		
in	order	to	reach	a	decision	on	this	point	we	must	discuss	the	question	whether	in	the	numberless	cases	in	which	the	expenditure	of	motion	is	accompanied	by	the	appearance	of	heat	the	motion	has	not	some	other	effect	than	the	production	of	heat	and	the	heat	some	other	cause	than	the	motion	but	humboldt	's	isothermal	lines	for	the	first	time	gave	tangibility	to	these	ideas	and	made	practicable	a	truly	scientific	study	of	comparative	climatology	it	was	not	until	another	method	of	generating	electricity	was	discovered	that	davy	's	demonstration	could	be	turned	to	practical	account		
the	opposition	managed	to	delay	the	publication	of	fresnel	's	papers	but	arago	continued	to	fight	with	his	customary	enthusiasm	and	pertinacity	and	at	last	in	1823	the	academy	yielded	and	voted	fresnel	into	its	ranks	thus	implicitly	admitting	the	value	of	his	work	before	hutton	's	views	could	be	accepted	his	pivotal	conception	that	time	is	long	must	be	established	by	convincing	proofs	thus	the	earth	should	rotate	from	east	to	west	but	nevertheless	the	absolute	movement	of	its	molecules	should	be	from	east	to	west	and	this	ought	also	to	apply	to	the	movement	of	the	revolution	of	the	satellites	in	which	the	direction	according	to	the	hypothesis	which	he	offers	is	not	necessarily	the	same	as	that	of	the	progressive	movement	of	the	planets		
the	water	so	heated	from	twelve	to	thirteen	degrees	centigrade	has	a	greater	bulk	after	being	shaken	than	it	had	before	"where	this	fluid	was	produced	in	abundance	by	great	dilatationthat	is	in	the	outer	and	highly	disintegrated	strata	the	superior	specific	gravity	of	the	crystals	forced	it	to	ooze	upward	and	thus	a	great	quantity	of	aqueous	vapor	was	produced	on	the	surface	of	the	globe	the	structure	of	nebulae	yet	the	new	instruments	while	leaving	so	much	untold	have	revealed	some	vastly	important	secrets	of	cosmic	structure		
1	but	this	experiment	demonstrated	another	thing	besides	the	possibility	of	producing	electric	light	and	chemical	decomposition	this	being	the	heating	power	capable	of	being	produced	by	the	electric	current	the	importance	of	this	discovery	was	at	once	recognized	by	sir	humphry	davy	who	began	experimenting	immediately	in	this	new	field	but	this	phenomenon	is	not	in	the	least	astonishing	when	it	is	seen	to	occur	also	within	the	limits	of	actual	glaciers	and	it	is	recalled	by	what	circumstances	it	is	occasioned		
in	1837	agassiz	had	introduced	his	theory	to	the	world	in	a	paper	read	at	neuchatel	and	three	years	later	he	published	his	famous	etudes	sur	les	glaciers	from	which	we	have	just	quoted	reversing	the	experiments	of	his	predecessors	who	had	found	that	electric	currents	may	generate	magnetism	he	showed	that	magnets	have	power	under	certain	circumstances	to	generate	electricity	he	proved	indeed	the	interconvertibility	of	electricity	and	magnetism	young	and	imaginative	men	could	accept	the	new	point	of	view	older	philosophers	their	minds	channelled	by	preconceptions	could	not	get	into	the	new	groove		
after	such	fiascos	the	cometary	train	could	never	again	pose	as	a	worlddestroyer	even	his	famous	cosmogonic	guess	according	to	which	water	is	the	essence	of	all	things	and	the	primordial	element	out	of	which	the	earth	was	developed	is	but	an	elaboration	of	the	babylonian	conception	indeed	his	work	might	almost	be	called	an	exposition	of	the	astronomical	doctrines	of	hipparchus		
diodorus	siculus	who	as	already	noted	lived	at	about	the	time	of	augustus	and	who	therefore	scanned	in	perspective	the	entire	sweep	of	classical	greek	history	has	left	us	a	striking	summary	which	is	doubly	valuable	because	of	its	comparisons	of	babylonian	with	greek	influence	let	us	witness	the	beginnings	of	scientific	therapeutics	this	classification	as	will	be	observed	is	not	so	very	far	afield	from	the	modern	divisions	into	mammals	birds	reptiles	amphibians	and	fishes		
if	one	will	hold	the	corkscrew	in	a	slanting	direction	and	turn	it	slowly	to	the	right	supposing	that	the	point	dips	up	a	portion	of	water	each	time	it	revolves	one	can	in	imagination	follow	the	flow	of	that	portion	of	water	from	spiral	to	spiral	the	water	always	running	downward	of	course	yet	paradoxically	being	lifted	higher	and	higher	towards	the	base	of	the	corkscrew	until	finally	it	pours	out	in	the	actual	archimedes	tube	at	the	top	if	it	seem	that	reference	to	this	carries	us	beyond	the	bounds	of	science	it	may	be	replied	that	questions	such	as	this	will	not	lie	beyond	the	bounds	of	the	science	of	the	near	future	as	a	pythagorean	doctrine	can	not	be	questioned		
such	as	it	is	however	the	natural	history	stands	to	the	credit	of	the	stagirite	hipparchus	must	have	known	of	that	measurement	since	he	quotes	the	work	of	aristarchus	in	other	fields	his	knowledge	of	anatomy	was	certainly	very	considerable	but	many	of	his	deductions	and	theories	as	to	the	functions	of	organs	the	cause	of	diseases	and	his	methods	of	treating	them	would	be	recognized	as	absurd	by	a	modern	schoolboy	of	average	intelligence		
here	then	was	the	heliocentric	doctrine	reduced	to	a	virtual	demonstration	by	aristarchus	of	samos	somewhere	about	the	middle	of	the	third	century	b.c	it	appears	however	that	the	egyptian	astronomer	divided	the	zodiac	into	twentyfour	decani	or	constellations	babylonian	medicine	we	have	just	seen	that	medical	practice	in	the	babylonian	world	was	strangely	under	the	cloud	of	superstition

we	know	how	essentially	eyeminded	the	egyptian	was	to	use	a	modern	psychological	phrasethat	is	to	say	how	essential	to	him	it	seemed	that	all	his	conceptions	should	be	visualized	in	this	air	heated	in	a	retort	like	a	miniature	altar	is	allowed	to	escape	through	the	sides	of	two	pairs	of	revolving	arms	precisely	like	those	of	the	ordinary	revolving	fountain	with	which	we	are	accustomed	to	water	our	lawns	the	revolving	arms	being	attached	to	a	plane	on	which	several	pairs	of	statuettes	representing	dancers	are	placed	an	even	more	interesting	application	of	this	principle	of	setting	a	wheel	in	motion	is	furnished	in	a	mechanism	which	must	be	considered	the	earliest	of	steamengines	he	might	claim	for	his	largest	atom	the	same	quality	of	substance	as	for	his	smallest	but	so	long	as	he	conceived	that	the	large	atoms	when	adjusted	together	to	form	a	tangible	substance	formed	a	substance	different	in	quality	from	the	substance	which	the	small	atoms	would	make	up	when	similarly	grouped	this	concession	amounts	to	the	predication	of	difference	of	quality	between	the	atoms	themselves		
as	already	noted	the	heliocentric	doctrine	is	not	expressly	stated	here	it	is	precisely	the	same	with	the	imagined	course	of	the	sun	in	its	orbit	only	that	we	view	these	lines	just	as	we	should	view	the	lantern	on	the	wheel	if	we	looked	at	it	from	directly	above	and	not	from	the	side	it	has	been	the	favorite	pastime	of	historians	to	weave	their	own	anachronistic	theories	upon	the	scanty	woof	of	the	halfremembered	thoughts	of	the	ancient	philosophers		
thus	plutarch	cites	empedocles	as	believing	that	the	ruling	part	is	not	in	the	head	or	in	the	breast	but	in	the	blood	wherefore	in	whatever	part	of	the	body	the	more	of	this	is	spread	in	that	part	men	excel	the	scientific	drama	is	now	played	out	upon	a	single	stage	and	if	we	pass	as	we	shall	in	the	present	chapter	from	alexandria	to	syracuse	and	from	syracuse	to	samos	the	shift	of	scenes	does	no	violence	to	the	dramatic	unities	yet	it	is	much	to	be	regretted	that	he	failed	to	do	so	since	the	deference	which	was	accorded	his	authority	throughout	the	middle	ages	would	doubtless	have	been	extended	in	some	measure	at	least	to	this	theory	as	well	had	he	championed	it		
here	there	were	no	flaws	in	the	reasoning	of	anaxagoras	the	latter	statement	would	not	bear	too	close	an	examination	yet	it	is	true	that	no	extensive	prose	compositions	of	an	earlier	day	than	this	have	been	preserved	though	numerous	others	are	known	by	their	fragments	this	theory	it	must	be	confessed	made	no	very	great	impression	upon	his	contemporaries

then	the	methods	of	observation	were	still	crude	and	it	was	quite	the	custom	for	a	thinker	of	forceful	personality	to	find	an	eager	following	among	disciples	who	never	thought	of	putting	his	theories	to	the	test	of	experiment	but	for	us	looking	back	without	prejudice	across	the	stage	of	years	it	seems	indisputable	that	a	great	epoch	came	to	a	close	at	about	the	time	when	the	barbarian	nations	of	europe	began	to	sweep	down	into	greece	and	italy	he	knew	also	that	the	heart	was	made	up	of	layers	of	fibres	that	ran	in	certain	fixed	directionsthat	is	longitudinal	transverse	and	oblique	but	he	did	not	recognize	the	heart	as	a	muscular	organ

but	besides	this	he	introduced	more	detailed	observation	of	diseases	and	demonstrated	the	importance	that	attaches	to	prognosis	"but	concludes	talbot	i	can	offer	no	decided	opinion	upon	such	obscure	points	of	their	superstition	here	they	are	first	the	surface	of	every	coherent	liquid	in	a	state	of	rest	is	spherical	and	the	centre	of	the	sphere	coincides	with	the	centre	of	the	earth		
as	we	moderns	see	it	such	criticism	is	the	highest	possible	praise	in	other	words	the	theory	of	epicycles	will	account	for	all	the	facts	of	the	observed	motions	of	all	the	heavenly	bodies	but	in	so	doing	it	fills	the	universe	with	a	most	bewildering	network	of	intersecting	circles	the	chinese	adopt	a	more	clumsy	expedient	supplying	a	different	symbol	for	each	of	the	meanings	of	a	syllable	so	that	while	the	actual	wordsounds	of	their	speech	are	only	a	few	hundreds	in	number	the	characters	of	their	written	language	mount	high	into	the	thousands		
neither	need	we	concern	ourselves	with	the	details	as	to	the	geographical	distances	which	strabo	found	so	worthy	of	criticism	and	controversy	on	the	other	hand	the	conservative	scholar	doubtless	thought	it	distinctly	ambiguous	once	every	ten	days	space	they	say	one	of	the	highest	order	of	these	stars	descends	to	them	that	are	of	the	lowest	like	a	messenger	sent	from	them	above	and	then	again	another	ascends	from	those	below	to	them	above	and	that	this	is	their	constant	natural	motion	to	continue	for	ever		
these	physicians	had	been	treating	this	condition	by	applications	of	poultices	to	the	hand	itself	the	sole	element	of	truth	which	these	dreamings	contain	as	distinguishing	them	from	the	dreamings	of	anaxagoras	is	in	the	conception	that	the	various	atoms	differ	in	size	and	weight	each	soldier	was	supplied	with	bandages	and	was	probably	instructed	in	applying	them	something	in	the	same	manner	as	is	done	now	in	all	modern	armies		
but	with	all	these	defects	the	total	achievement	of	the	greek	astronomers	is	stupendous	the	passage	of	aristotle	in	which	this	opinion	is	ascribed	to	anaxagoras	is	of	sufficient	interest	to	be	quoted	at	length	democritus	of	abdera	says	aristotle	and	some	others	that	have	spoken	concerning	respiration	have	determined	nothing	concerning	other	animals	but	seem	to	have	supposed	that	all	animals	respire	he	maintained	for	example	that	respiration	and	the	pulsebeat	were	for	one	and	the	same	purposethat	of	the	reception	of	air	into	the	arteries	of	the	body		
his	writings	on	natural	history	have	largely	been	preserved	and	they	constitute	by	far	the	most	important	contribution	to	the	subject	that	has	come	down	to	us	from	antiquity	it	is	certainly	one	of	the	most	remarkable	scientific	documents	of	antiquity	with	the	culmination	of	greek	effort	in	the	socalled	hellenistic	period	we	have	seen	ancient	science	at	its	climax		
thus	he	constructs	numerous	mechanisms	in	which	the	expansive	power	of	air	under	pressure	is	made	to	do	work	and	others	in	which	the	same	end	is	accomplished	through	the	expansive	power	of	heated	air	the	proof	that	the	sun	is	describing	this	waving	line	and	therefore	must	be	considered	as	attached	to	an	imaginary	wheel	is	furnished	as	it	seemed	to	hipparchus	by	the	observed	fact	of	the	sun	's	varying	speed	in	a	word	the	evidence	so	far	as	we	can	garner	it	from	the	remaining	fragments	tends	to	show	that	all	along	from	the	time	of	the	early	pythagoreans	there	had	been	an	undercurrent	of	opinion	in	the	philosophical	world	which	questioned	the	fixity	of	the	earth	and	it	would	seem	that	the	school	of	thinkers	who	tended	to	accept	the	revolutionary	view	centred	in	asia	minor	not	far	from	the	early	home	of	the	founder	of	the	pythagorean	doctrines
