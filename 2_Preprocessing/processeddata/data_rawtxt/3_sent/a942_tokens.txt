she	does	not	boast	of	her	mastery	of	nature	but	to	her	she	brings	with	infinite	care	and	joy	her	offerings	of	love	life	based	upon	science	is	attractive	to	some	men	because	it	has	all	the	characteristics	of	sport	it	feigns	seriousness	but	is	not	profound	the	reaction	of	disillusionment	is	just	as	unreal	as	the	first	shock	of	illusion		
it	is	civilisation	of	human	relationship	this	experience	of	your	soul	in	meeting	a	personality	in	the	heart	of	the	world	has	been	embodied	in	your	civilisation	this	dragon	did	not	belong	to	the	mythology	of	the	past	but	of	the	present	and	with	its	iron	mask	it	tried	to	look	real	to	the	children	of	the	age	real	as	the	majestic	rocks	on	the	shore	as	the	epic	rhythm	of	the	seawaves		
and	the	true	expression	of	this	love	is	in	the	language	of	beauty	which	is	so	abundantly	universal	in	this	land	it	is	science	but	not	its	wrong	application	in	life	a	mere	imitation	of	our	science	teachers	who	reduce	it	into	a	superstition	absurdly	invoking	its	aid	for	all	impossible	purposes	we	know	that	in	the	early	stage	of	man	's	moral	immaturity	he	only	feels	reverence	for	the	god	whose	malevolence	he	dreads		
and	it	has	come	to	pass	that	the	children	of	those	heroes	who	would	keep	their	word	at	the	point	of	death	who	would	disdain	to	cheat	men	for	vulgar	profit	who	even	in	their	fight	would	much	rather	court	defeat	than	be	dishonourable	have	become	energetic	in	dealing	with	falsehoods	and	do	not	feel	humiliated	by	gaining	advantage	from	them	a	mere	knowledge	of	things	can	be	had	in	a	short	enough	time	but	their	spirit	can	only	be	acquired	by	centuries	of	training	and	selfcontrol	the	genius	of	europe	has	given	her	people	the	power	of	organisation	which	has	specially	made	itself	manifest	in	politics	and	commerce	and	in	coordinating	scientific	knowledge		
in	other	great	countries	signs	of	man	's	power	loomed	large	and	i	saw	vast	organisations	which	showed	efficiency	in	all	their	features	they	are	loud	in	their	boast	that	they	have	modernised	japan	but	in	japan	it	is	not	the	display	of	power	or	wealth	that	is	the	predominating	element		
such	a	civilisation	has	the	gift	of	immortality	for	it	does	not	offend	against	the	laws	of	creation	and	is	not	assailed	by	all	the	forces	of	nature	what	is	still	more	dangerous	for	japan	is	not	this	imitation	of	the	outer	features	of	the	west	but	the	acceptance	of	the	motive	force	of	the	western	civilisation	as	her	own	this	is	the	reason	why	a	stranger	like	myself	instead	of	feeling	envy	or	humiliation	before	these	manifestations	of	beauty	these	creations	of	love	feels	a	readiness	to	participate	in	the	joy	and	glory	of	such	revealment	of	the	human	heart		
i	feel	it	is	an	impiety	to	be	indifferent	to	its	protection	from	the	incursion	of	vulgarity	of	power	where	man	is	at	his	greatest	he	is	unconscious	therefore	i	am	afraid	of	the	rude	pressure	of	the	political	ideals	of	the	west	upon	your	own		
in	past	ages	we	had	foreign	invasions	there	had	been	cruelty	and	bloodshed	intrigues	of	jealousy	and	avarice	but	they	never	touched	the	soul	of	the	people	deeply	for	the	people	as	a	body	never	participated	in	these	games	this	spiritual	bond	of	love	she	has	established	with	the	hills	of	her	country	with	the	sea	and	the	streams	with	the	forests	in	all	their	flowery	moods	and	varied	physiognomy	of	branches	she	has	taken	into	her	heart	all	the	rustling	whispers	and	sighing	of	the	woodlands	and	sobbing	of	the	waves	the	sun	and	the	moon	she	has	studied	in	all	the	modulations	of	their	lights	and	shades	and	she	is	glad	to	close	her	shops	to	greet	the	seasons	in	her	orchards	and	gardens	and	cornfields	but	the	tidal	wave	of	falsehood	has	swept	over	your	land	from	that	part	of	the	world	where	business	is	business	and	honesty	is	followed	in	it	merely	as	the	best	policy		
she	has	achieved	something	which	is	positive	and	complete	one	must	bear	in	mind	that	those	who	have	the	true	modern	spirit	need	not	modernise	just	as	those	who	are	truly	brave	are	not	braggarts	we	must	not	vitiate	our	children	's	minds	with	the	superstition	that	business	is	business	war	is	war	politics	is	politics		
it	pursues	success	with	skill	and	thoroughness	and	takes	no	account	of	the	higher	nature	of	man	i	have	felt	that	you	have	been	able	to	assimilate	these	secrets	into	your	life	and	the	truth	which	lies	in	the	beauty	of	all	things	has	passed	into	your	souls	in	political	civilisation	the	state	is	an	abstraction	and	relationship	of	men	utilitarian		
therefore	i	can	not	think	that	the	imitation	of	the	outward	aspects	of	the	west	which	is	becoming	more	and	more	evident	in	modern	japan	is	essential	to	her	strength	or	stability	the	divine	in	her	heart	is	suffering	from	the	injuries	inflicted	by	her	hands	upon	the	world	and	from	this	pain	of	her	higher	nature	flows	the	secret	balm	which	will	bring	healing	to	those	injuries	europe	is	not	ready	to	give	up	her	political	inhumanity	with	all	the	baser	passions	of	man	attendant	upon	it	she	believes	only	in	modification	of	systems	and	not	in	change	of	heart		
therefore	its	rivalry	to	things	that	are	modest	and	profound	and	have	the	subtle	delicacy	of	life	is	to	be	dreaded	science	speaks	of	the	struggle	for	existence	but	forgets	that	man	's	existence	is	not	merely	of	the	surface	it	is	easy	to	be	unfair	in	one	's	judgment	when	one	is	faced	with	human	miseries	and	pessimism	is	the	result	of	building	theories	while	the	mind	is	suffering		
for	man	's	struggle	for	existence	is	to	exist	in	the	fullness	of	his	nature	not	by	curtailing	all	that	is	best	in	him	and	dwarfing	his	existence	itself	but	by	accepting	all	the	responsibilities	of	his	spiritual	life	even	through	death	and	defeat	but	while	trying	to	free	our	minds	from	the	arrogant	claims	of	europe	and	to	help	ourselves	out	of	the	quicksands	of	our	infatuation	we	may	go	to	the	other	extreme	and	blind	ourselves	with	a	wholesale	suspicion	of	the	west	when	japan	is	in	imminent	peril	of	neglecting	to	realise	where	she	is	great	it	is	the	duty	of	a	foreigner	like	myself	to	remind	her	that	she	has	given	rise	to	a	civilisation	which	is	perfect	in	its	form	and	has	evolved	a	sense	of	sight	which	clearly	sees	truth	in	beauty	and	beauty	in	truth		
it	would	be	altogether	unjust	both	to	us	and	to	europe	to	say	that	she	has	fascinated	the	modern	eastern	mind	by	the	mere	exhibition	of	her	power	and	the	time	has	come	when	you	have	to	be	roused	into	full	consciousness	of	the	truth	by	which	you	live	so	that	you	may	not	be	taken	unawares	this	opening	of	the	heart	to	the	soul	of	the	world	is	not	confined	to	a	section	of	your	privileged	classes	it	is	not	the	forced	product	of	exotic	culture	but	it	belongs	to	all	your	men	and	women	of	all	conditions		
its	harsh	obtrusiveness	makes	it	forcibly	visible	to	us	overcoming	our	senses	and	we	bring	to	its	altar	sacrifices	as	does	a	savage	to	the	fetish	which	appears	powerful	because	of	its	hideousness	the	ideal	of	maitri	is	at	the	bottom	of	your	culture,"maitri	with	men	and	maitri	with	nature	it	is	really	because	we	are	afraid	of	our	own	weakness	which	allows	itself	to	be	overcome	by	the	sight	of	power	that	we	try	to	substitute	for	it	another	weakness	which	makes	itself	blind	to	the	glories	of	the	west		
after	centuries	of	civilisation	nations	fearing	each	other	like	the	prowling	wild	beasts	of	the	night	time	shutting	their	doors	of	hospitality	combining	only	for	purpose	of	aggression	or	defence	hiding	in	their	holes	their	trade	secrets	state	secrets	secrets	of	their	armaments	making	peace	offerings	to	the	barking	dogs	of	each	other	with	the	meat	which	does	not	belong	to	them	holding	down	fallen	races	struggling	to	stand	upon	their	feet	counting	their	safety	only	upon	the	feebleness	of	the	rest	of	humanity	with	their	right	hands	dispensing	religion	to	weaker	peoples	while	robbing	them	with	their	left	is	there	anything	in	this	to	make	us	envious?.you	have	known	her	language	of	lines	and	music	of	colours	the	symmetry	in	her	irregularities	and	the	cadence	in	her	freedom	of	movements	you	have	seen	how	she	leads	her	immense	crowds	of	things	yet	avoids	all	frictions	how	the	very	conflicts	in	her	creations	break	out	in	dance	and	music	how	her	exuberance	has	the	aspect	of	the	fullness	of	selfabandonment	and	not	a	mere	dissipation	of	display	they	brought	their	basket	of	fruits	to	me	and	held	their	lighted	incense	before	my	face	wishing	to	pay	homage	to	a	man	who	had	come	from	the	land	of	buddha		
therefore	they	are	in	harmony	with	life	's	growth	or	else	when	the	time	comes	they	easily	give	way	and	are	forgotten	things	that	are	living	are	so	easily	hurt	therefore	they	require	protection	and	this	has	been	effected	by	the	charm	of	the	word	modern		
while	travelling	in	a	railway	train	i	met	at	a	wayside	station	some	buddhist	priests	and	devotees	they	were	merely	the	outcome	of	individual	ambitions	your	race	has	shown	that	genius	not	by	acquirements	but	by	creations	not	by	display	of	things	but	by	manifestation	of	its	own	inner	being		
but	is	this	the	ideal	of	man	which	we	can	look	up	to	with	pride?.are	we	to	bend	our	knees	to	the	spirit	of	this	civilisation	which	is	sowing	broadcast	over	all	the	world	seeds	of	fear	greed	suspicion	unashamed	lies	of	its	diplomacy	and	unctuous	lies	of	its	profession	of	peace	and	goodwill	and	universal	brotherhood	of	man?.i	do	not	for	a	moment	suggest	that	japan	should	be	unmindful	of	acquiring	modern	weapons	of	selfprotection		
your	national	unity	has	not	been	evolved	from	the	comradeship	of	arms	for	defensive	and	offensive	purposes	or	from	partnership	in	raiding	adventures	dividing	among	each	member	the	danger	and	spoils	of	robbery	is	the	instinct	of	the	west	right	where	she	builds	her	national	welfare	behind	the	barricade	of	a	universal	distrust	of	humanity?".but	if	undiluted	utility	be	modern	beauty	is	of	all	ages	if	mean	selfishness	be	modern	the	human	ideals	are	no	new	inventions		
there	are	races	who	worship	the	animals	they	kill	we	can	buy	meat	from	them	when	we	are	hungry	but	not	the	worship	which	goes	with	the	killing	but	unfortunately	all	his	armour	is	not	living	some	of	it	is	made	of	steel	inert	and	mechanical	never	think	for	a	moment	that	the	hurts	you	inflict	upon	other	races	will	not	infect	you	and	the	enmities	you	sow	around	your	homes	will	be	a	wall	of	protection	to	you	for	all	time	to	come		
if	he	is	weak	enough	to	grow	smaller	to	fit	himself	to	his	covering	then	it	becomes	a	process	of	gradual	suicide	by	shrinkage	of	the	soul	so	the	questions	you	have	to	put	to	yourselves	are	these,"have	we	read	the	world	wrong	and	based	our	relation	to	it	upon	an	ignorance	of	human	nature?.but	a	mere	political	relationship	is	all	conscious	it	is	an	eruptive	inflammation	of	aggressiveness		
there	display	and	extravagance	in	dress	in	furniture	in	costly	entertainments	are	startling	her	relationship	with	the	world	is	the	deeper	relationship	of	heart	japan	must	be	reminded	that	it	is	her	sense	of	the	rhythm	of	life	and	of	all	things	her	genius	for	simplicity	her	love	for	cleanliness	her	definiteness	of	thought	and	action	her	cheerful	fortitude	her	immense	reserve	of	force	in	selfcontrol	her	sensitiveness	to	her	code	of	honour	and	defiance	of	death	which	have	given	her	the	power	to	resist	the	cyclonic	storm	of	exploitation	that	has	sprung	from	the	shores	of	europe	circling	round	and	round	the	world		
it	is	discrediting	the	ideals	which	were	born	of	the	lives	of	men	who	were	our	greatest	and	best	you	have	known	that	energies	of	nature	save	themselves	from	wearing	out	by	the	rhythm	of	a	perfect	grace	and	that	she	with	the	tenderness	of	her	curved	lines	takes	away	fatigue	from	the	world	's	muscles	therefore	she	is	ever	ready	for	fight	and	the	best	portion	of	her	attention	is	occupied	in	organising	forces		
therefore	the	ideals	whose	seats	were	in	the	hearts	of	the	people	would	not	undergo	any	serious	change	owing	to	the	policies	adopted	by	the	kings	or	generals	it	is	not	an	outcome	of	the	necessity	of	organisation	for	some	ulterior	purpose	but	it	is	an	extension	of	the	family	and	the	obligations	of	the	heart	in	a	wide	field	of	space	and	time	the	past	has	been	god	's	gift	to	you	about	the	present	you	must	make	your	own	choice

let	us	first	fill	our	country	's	coffers	with	stolen	goods	and	then	take	centuries	like	these	other	countries	to	answer	for	them	if	we	must	and	how	can	i	have	the	power	to	refuse	to	take	the	money?.i	made	no	reply	but	though	i	was	looking	another	way	i	could	not	help	feeling	that	sandip	's	plaintive	gaze	had	planted	itself	right	on	my	face	and	would	take	no	denial		
keeping	them	and	accumulating	them	alike	are	false	i	had	a	constant	feeling	that	something	extraordinary	might	happen	any	moment	for	which	however	the	responsibility	would	not	be	mine	we	men	with	our	ideas	strive	to	give	it	a	particular	shape	by	melting	it	into	a	particular	mouldinto	the	definiteness	of	success

these	are	the	offerings	of	my	worship	to	ward	the	dust	off	the	feet	of	my	wakeful	divinity.".men	have	a	perpetual	longing	to	bring	out	this	shakti	from	the	hidden	depths	of	their	own	nature	and	those	of	us	who	succeed	in	doing	so	at	once	clearly	understand	the	meaning	of	the	music	coming	to	us	from	the	dark	's	and	m.a.		
i	covered	my	eyes	with	the	end	of	my	sari	which	i	pressed	to	my	face	with	both	my	hands	and	sobbed	and	sobbed	i	asked	he	begged	and	prayed	harish	kundu	his	zamindar	to	let	him	sell	off	his	stock	bought	with	borrowed	money	promising	faithfully	never	to	do	it	again	but	the	zamindar	would	not	hear	of	it	and	insisted	on	his	burning	the	foreign	stuff	there	and	then	if	he	wanted	to	be	let	off
