she	ca	n’t	be	more	than	twentyseven	but	she	looks	forty	at	least	and	stout	and	sticking	out	all	in	the	wrong	places	and	flat	where	the	stickouts	ought	to	be	you	had	 	better	come	down	at	once	these	things	are	probably	in	your	line	to	 	save	me	from	some	sheer	idiocy	there	they	were	sitting	round	the	teatable	just	as	at	tryland		
mr.	carruthers	got	in	and	tucked	his	sable	rug	round	me	and	i	contrived	that	he	should	not	speak	to	me	again	alone	before	he	said	goodnight	i	know	you	think	that	silly	and	i	stopped	him	as	he	was	about	to	speak	but	of	course	as	it	does	not	last	any	way	it	might	be	good	for	a	little	to	begin	like	that	do	n’t	you	think	so	he	looked	round	the	room	and	on	through	the	wide	open	double	doors	into	my	dainty	bedroom	where	véronique	was	still	packing		
i	am	sure	any	one	would	be	terribly	shocked	to	read	what	i	have	written	but	not	so	much	if	they	knew	robert	and	how	utterly	adorable	he	is	now	i	think	we	have	demolished	all	your	silly	little	reasons	for	making	me	miserable	he	said	nasty	yellowish	wood	furniture	and	nothing	much	matching	however	there	are	plenty	of	wardrobes	so	véronique	is	content		
i	am	the	only	person	whom	i	mean	to	obey	and	i	settled	myself	deliberately	in	the	velvet	pillows	perfectly	mad	with	fury	and	jealousy	no	i	do	n’t	think	so	i	said	leaving	the	part	about	the	valuer	unanswered

mr.	carruthers	is	a	perfect	host	of	course	it	must	have	been	because	once	she	had	been	engaged	to	papa	fancy	being	owned	by	that		
i	am	sure	people	would	think	it	most	improper!.but	i	will	show	you	the	pictures	myself	tomorrow	bob	this	at	once	decided	me	to	take	lord	robert	round	tonight	and	i	told	him	so	in	a	velvet	voice	while	mr.	barton	was	engaging	christopher	’s	attention	i	knew	that		
i	thanked	her	again	but	remained	firm	in	my	intention	of	accustoming	myself	to	company	and	yet	i	have	no	business	to	say	that	they	are	a	washy	blue	with	the	family	white	eyelashes	how	different	to	lord	robert	’s		
you	must	always	make	them	realize	you	will	be	off	like	a	snipe	if	they	relax	their	efforts	to	please	you	for	one	moment	however	tonight	with	the	terror	upon	her	of	a	husband	fresh	from	a	rough	channel	passage	going	to	arrive	at	seven	o’clock	she	was	actually	dressed	and	down	in	the	hall	when	i	got	there	punctually	at	6.45	and	in	the	twinkle	of	an	eye	we	were	rolling	in	the	electric	to	willis’s	they	are	all	as	good	as	gold	on	top	and	one	does	poker	work	and	another	binds	books	and	a	third	embroiders	altarcloths	and	the	fourth	knits	tiesall	for	charities	and	they	ask	everyone	to	subscribe	to	them	directly	they	come	to	the	house		
she	was	capricious	as	she	sometimes	is	lord	robert	announced	he	was	going	there	now	and	would	tell	her	sufficient	for	me	to	know	that	my	selfrespect	is	restored	and	i	can	now	go	out	and	see	the	world	with	a	clear	conscience		
i	called	the	man	and	asked	him	where	was	his	lordship	now?.so	i	expected	something	wonderful	in	the	way	of	food	but	it	is	not	half	so	good	as	our	chef	gave	us	at	branches	he	has	the	most	charming	way	of	making	one	feel	that	one	knows	him	very	well	he	looks	at	one	every	now	and	then	straight	in	the	eyes	with	astonishing	frankness

your	words	can	not	alter	my	basic	principle	which	you	will	find	very	sound	if	you	care	to	apply	to	it	the	test	of	common	sense	that	it	had	only	just	begun!.[illustration	i	wonder	if	you	smoke	dear	girl	i	wonder	if	you	smoke	dear	girl		
there	are	numbers	of	girls	who	at	the	end	of	a	month	of	marriage	have	done	said	and	looked	things	which	they	would	have	died	rather	than	let	their	fiancés	perceive	hear	or	see	and	yet	who	are	much	astonished	and	feel	resentful	and	aggrieved	because	they	begin	to	reap	the	harvest	of	their	own	actions	in	the	fact	of	their	husbands	showing	less	love	and	respect	for	them	deportment	masters	and	mistresses	grew	to	be	less	and	less	in	vogue	and	ridicule	was	cast	upon	the	rules	that	had	been	in	practice	for	every	girl	entering	society	elinor	not	at	all		
the	whole	tendency	as	i	think	i	said	in	a	former	letter	of	modern	society	is	toward	rowdiness	and	vulgarity	and	if	one	is	very	young	and	full	of	spirits	it	is	so	easy	to	be	led	away	into	indiscretions	when	one	sees	most	of	one	’s	companions	doing	the	same	thing	thus	if	you	bore	your	husband	in	his	leisure	he	may	stay	with	you	for	a	while	from	a	sense	of	duty	but	he	will	begin	to	make	excuses	of	work	to	curtail	the	moments	and	he	will	snatch	time	from	his	real	work	for	his	pleasure	elsewhere	elinor	nowhere
