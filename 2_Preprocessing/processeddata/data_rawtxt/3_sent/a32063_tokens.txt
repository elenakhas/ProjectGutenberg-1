there	was	the	marigee	who	would	shriek	all	is	lost	he	had	shot	at	it	a	hundred	times	with	his	needle	gun	but	always	it	flew	away	unharmed	voices	in	and	of	the	night	the	gleam	of	firelight	upon	their	bodies	and	the	waiting	drummer		
but	the	gun	was	in	his	hand	when	at	dusk	he	strode	into	the	compound	"all	earthlings	come	from	the	sky	now	there	were	a	dozen	marigees	that	screamed	that	all	was	lost		
he	retreated	a	step	to	keep	beyond	their	front	rank	those	sounds	and	those	alone	the	race	of	trees	the	pure	race	of	trees	that	never	interbred	that	stood	firm	always

click	of	heels	and	a	salute	that	once	greeted	the	caesars	and	later	the	pseudoaryan	of	the	20th	century	and	but	yesterday	he	who	was	now	known	as	the	last	of	the	dictators	in	spite	of	everything	in	spite	of	his	score	of	ultravicious	secret	weapons	and	the	last	desperate	efforts	of	his	weakened	armies	most	of	whose	men	were	under	twenty	or	over	forty	utter	silence	and	at	last	he	was	strong	enough	to	let	go	his	grip	on	the	tree	and	stand	erect	again	to	look	about	to	get	his	bearings		
rocket	ships	raining	hell	from	the	sky	havoc	and	chaos	and	the	end	of	hope	that	had	been	at	the	public	school	meet	in	the	new	los	angeles	he	could	see	one	edge	of	the	column	and	it	was	a	neat	orderly	edge		
but	he	staggered	on	almost	blindly	running	writhing	tearing	off	his	clothes	as	he	ran	"he	is	an	earthling	but	there	have	been	such	before	on	venus	many	many	of	them	who	came	long	and	long	ago	from	the	skies	but	they	kept	coming	back

screaming	with	pain	he	whirled	about	and	ran	beating	with	his	hands	at	the	burning	spots	on	his	body	almost	mr.	smith	forgot	people	and	the	solar	system	and	what	had	been	"i	am	number	one	said	mr.	smith	and	lord	of	all	the	planets		
but	for	days	and	nights	he	lay	without	moving	and	without	speaking	or	opening	his	eyes	and	they	did	not	know	whether	he	would	live	or	die	the	long	days	and	the	marigees	screams	the	slithering	swish	of	the	surf	the	ghostquiet	movements	of	the	baroons	in	the	trees	and	the	raucousness	of	their	shrill	voices	but	they	got	into	his	bed	into	his	clothes	into	his	food		
they	kept	him	sane	by	giving	him	something	tangible	something	inferior	to	hate	he	wet	his	lips	when	he	read	that	in	some	you	may	receive	humane	treatment		
he	stood	there	swaying	and	the	incredulous	eyes	of	the	natives	widened	as	they	saw	the	condition	of	his	body	and	the	blankness	of	his	eyes	leagues	back	of	the	battered	lines	you	could	feel	that	hate	and	vengeance	as	a	tangible	thing	a	thing	that	thickened	the	air	that	made	breathing	difficult	and	talking	futile	for	the	times	of	silence	were	louder		
nrana	listened	but	he	shook	his	head	he	must	have	killed	millions	of	kifs	they	bothered	his	sleep		
there	was	a	shrill	screaming	in	his	ears	that	must	have	been	the	sound	of	his	own	voice	they	seldom	went	far	from	their	villages	the	spaceradar	operator	who	had	once	occupied	the	shack	reported	that	he	had	never	seen	one	of	them	bushes	and	the	rough	bark	of	trees	tore	his	flesh		
he	said	i	will	serve	you	yes	and	then	he	could	run	no	longer	and	he	clutched	a	tree	to	keep	from	falling	his	arms	trembling	about	it	and	his	face	pressed	against	the	impersonal	roughness	of	the	bark	and	the	rains	came	and	went	away	again		
the	presence	of	others	would	have	forced	recognition	of	his	miserably	changed	status	and	there	was	discipline	for	the	ones	on	the	outside	were	larger	than	those	in	the	center	nights	he	walked	the	beach	and	that	night	was	one	of	the	noisy	nights		
conrad	's	voice	in	his	ear	as	it	had	sounded	that	day	when	conrad	had	walked	into	the	palace	whitefaced	and	forgotten	the	salute	he	said	i	am	number	one	the	lord	of	all	the	solar	system	and	your	ruler	he	talked	on	hoping	the	earthling	would	talk	too	and	he	did	not	recognize	the	danger	of	his	silence		
others	started	toward	him	his	throat	raw	from	the	screaming	invective	of	his	hate	"number	one	silence		
his	old	eyes	misted	the	eyes	of	the	dictator	closed	not	the	bitterness	of	regret	but	of	defeat		
and	then	came	alwa	the	aged	chieftain	and	nrana	his	son	there	was	no	wind	but	the	tree	swayed	back	and	forth	and	his	body	with	it	the	man	in	the	greatcoat	shrugged		
sometimes	fantastic	thoughts	went	through	his	head	theirs	was	the	passive	resistance	of	a	vast	productivity	that	bred	kifs	ceaselessly	overwhelmingly	billions	to	replace	millions	the	captain	's	voice	too	was	rigid	with	unemotion		
and	then	while	the	women	began	wailing	for	the	dead	the	men	made	council	drums	he	looked	about	with	dull	eyes	that	seemed	to	see	nothing	and	understand	nothing		
just	drums	many	miles	away	throbbing	rhythm	for	native	dances	or	exorcising	perhaps	the	forestnight	demons	he	had	foreseen	thatthe	need	for	solitude	that	is	all

he	retreated	another	stepand	then	quite	suddenly	his	body	was	afire	in	several	spreading	places	nrana	did	not	know	the	words	for	delirium	and	paranoia	but	he	could	distinguish	between	them	and	the	soundit	was	like	the	sound	of	the	surf	but	it	was	continuous
