He in the forefront, tallest of the tall,     Poleaxe in hand, unhinging at a stroke     The brazen portals, made the doorway fall,     And widemouthed as a window, through the oak, A panelled plank hewn out, a yawning rent he broke..He spake, and quickly snatched from Vesta's shrine The deathless fire and wreaths and effigy divine..My foodhard berries that the boughs supply,     And roots of grass.		
So now, though passion and indignant hate     Prompt to engage, his mandate they obey,     And bar each inlet, and secure each gate, And, armed, in sheltering towers their enemies await..Which way to wander, whither to return?.Have the sword     And flames of Troy avenged me but in vain?		
So, mad with Fate,     Bloodstained Orestes flees his mother's ghost,     Armed with black snakes and firebrands; at the gate The avenging Fiends, closecrouched, the murderer await..Thy corpse defiled,     Thy mangled limbswhere are they?.Hermes cried,     "And stay to beautify thy lady's town, And dote on Tyrian realms, and disregard thine own?		
"Nay, if the ninth fair morning show fine day,     And bring the sunshine, be a match decreed     For Teucrian ships, their swiftness to essay..Far and nigh     Beneath his thundering wheels the heaving main     Sinks, and the waves are tranquil, and on high Through flying stormdrift shines the immeasurable sky..Hung in a loop around his shoulders lies     A filthy gaberdine.		
LXV..Full many a prince from Latium far and wide,     And all Ausonia had essayed in vain     To win the fair Lavinia for his bride..No more     He heeds such timid prey, but longs to hear     The tawny lion, issuing with a roar Forth from the lofty hills, and front the foaming boar.		
So raves AEneas, victor of the war,     His sword now warmed, and many a foeman dies..Make her thine, I pray,     And safely through the doubtful air convey.'.What end of standing?		
Sweat streams from every pore,     And, black with dust, from all his limbs descends..First foe,     Fell Lagus, doomed an evil fate to dree..LXII.		
"First, Heaven and Earth and Ocean's liquid plains,     The Moon's bright globe and planets of the pole,     One mind, infused through every part, sustains;     One universal, animating soul     Quickens, unites and mingles with the whole..I obey; Lead on, my son, I yield and follow on thy way.'."Long have I wished to show thee, face to face,     Italia's sons, that thou might'st joy with me     To hail the newfound country of our race."		
O fatherland!.Flushed with the death of Geryon, came this way     Alcides, glorying in the victor's meed,     And hither drove his mighty bulls to feed..These search the flintstones for the seeds of flame, Those point to newfound streams, or scour the woods for game.		
Ah pity!.As in the broad air warring winds begin     The battle, matched in strength and rage, nor they,     The winds themselves, nor clouds nor sea give way,     All locked in strife, and struggling as they can,     And long in doubtful balance hangs the day,     So meet the ranks, and mingle in the van, And foot clings close to foot, and man is massed with man..Here lies our home.		
A panther's skin supplies     His scarf, hung leftward, and his watchful ward, Two dogs, the threshold leave, and 'company their lord..Sick, gasping, spent, his weary neck he tends;     Loose o'er his bosom floats the beard unbound..Let yon false Dardan with remorseful eye     Drink in this balefire from the deep, and sigh     To bear the omens of my death."		
'Tis not in me the fatal hour to stay..Where that hand So oft to Turnus pledged, thy kinsman of the land?.XXV.		
Our shape the Mother, pitying, changed and gave     Immortal life, to spend beneath the wave..Come then, all,     And give such worth due honour..Spars hand through hand, and tempts to the attack,     One, nimblerfooted, on his youth relies;     Entellus' strength is in his limbs and size.		
Proud stalks the phantom, gladdening in the van,     With darts provokes him, and with words defies..LIV..But for her promised loyalty to the dead Sychaeus, she must have yielded (136).		
Loud shrieks are heard, and wails of the distrest,     The souls of babes, that on the threshold cry,     Reft of sweet life, and ravished from the breast,     And early plunged in bitter death..CXII..Once Hector's comate, proud at Hector's side     To wind the clarion and the sword to wield.		
"Lo, these who think a paltry wall can save,     A narrow ditch can thwart us,these, so bold,     With but a span betwixt them and the grave!.From the loins he came     Of Vulcan, and his huge mouth evermore     Spewed forth a torrent of Vulcanian flame; Proudly he stalked the earth, and shook the world's fair frame.."Though greater than the great Achilles he,     Though, like Achilles, Vulcan's arms he wear,     Fain will I meet him.		
XXXII..One shouting troop young Priam's lead obeys,     Thy son, Polites, from his grandsire hight,     And born erelong Italia's fame to raise..Fame is, that Daedalus, adventuring forth     On rapid wings, from Minos' realms in flight,     Trusted the sky, and to the frosty North     Swam his strange way, till on the towergirt height     Of Chalcis gently he essayed to light.		
They bound along the main, And soon with gladdening hearts the wellknown shore attain..XXXVIII..LVI.		
Strange sonsso Latin oracles conspire     Shall come, whose offspring shall exalt our line..To AEneas go,     And take these gifts..With tears his comrades lifted from the ground     Dead Pallas; groaning, on his shield they bore     Him homeward, and the bitter wail went round.		
Back, from another quarter of the sky,     Darkambushed, round the clamorous Harpies fly     With taloned claws, and taste and taint the prey.."'Here, girt with steel, the foremost in the fight,     Fierce Juno stands, the Scaean gates before,     And, mad with fury and malignant spite,     Calls up her federate forces from the shore..One passion burns,to let the sword decide.		
he yells, and searches for his sword     In couch and chamber, maddening at the core     With war's fierce passion, and the lust abhorred     Of slaughter, and with bitter wrath yet more..His hand still grasped the hatchet for the stroke, And bitter wrath he breathed, and fierce the words he spoke..XIX.

The rising settlement, the newtilled shore,     The ships deserted for the land she views,     And shaking her imperial brows, and sore With anguish, from her breast these wrathful words doth pour: XL..Here, craving counsel when in doubtful plight,     Italians and OEnotria's tribes are found.."Arm," cry the warriors, "arm!"

Lo,     Fight we by turns, each scarce can find a foe..Dauntless he waits, collected in his might,     The noble foe, then, measuring at a glance     The space his arm can cover with the lance;     "May this right hand, my deity," cried he,     "And this poised javelin aid the doubtful chance..Nautes advises AEneas to leave behind the weak and aged with Acestes.		
Warm milk from bowls, and holy blood we pour, And thrice with loud farewell the peaceful shade deplore..One boon I ask, nor that in Fate's despite,     For Latium, for the honour of thy kind..Whence comest thou again,     Longlookedfor Hector?		
XLII..LVIII..XXXIII.		
XXVI..Fresh signs and wonders enforce the prophecy (46126)..Hence every vineyard teems with mellowing fruit, Till hollow vale o'erflows, and gorge profound, Where'er the god hath turned his comely head.		
The more impoverished they, the keenlier all To mend the fallen fortunes of their race Will nerve them, fill the cells up, tier on tier, And weave their granaries from the rifled flowers..Twice is the teeming produce gathered in, Twofold their time of harvest year by year, Once when Taygete the Pleiad uplifts Her comely forehead for the earth to see, With foot of scorn spurning the oceanstreams, Once when in gloom she flies the watery Fish, And dips from heaven into the wintry wave..they buzz and buzz About the doors and threshold; till at length Safe laid to rest they hush them for the night, And welcome slumber laps their weary limbs.		
Nay, every race on earth of men, and beasts, And oceanfolk, and flocks, and painted birds, Rush to the raging fire: love sways them all..Why trace Things mightier?.And time it is that oft Unfreighted wheels be drawn along the ground Behind them, as to dint the surfacedust; Then let the beechen axle strain and creak 'Neath some stout burden, whilst a brazen pole Drags on the wheels made fast thereto.		
Land which the burrowing share shows dark and rich, With crumbling soil for this we counterfeit In ploughing for corn is goodliest; from no field More wains thou'lt see wend home with plodding steers; Or that from which the husbandman in spleen Has cleared the timber, and o'erthrown the copse That year on year lay idle, and from the roots Uptorn the immemorial haunt of birds; They banished from their nests have sought the skies; But the rude plain beneath the ploughshare's stroke Starts into sudden brightness..Quick icecrusts curdle on the running stream, And ironhooped wheels the water's back now bears, To broad wains opened, as erewhile to ships; Brass vessels oft asunder burst, and clothes Stiffen upon the wearers; juicy wines They cleave with axes; to one frozen mass Whole pools are turned; and on their untrimmed beards Stiff clings the jagged icicle..Now, awful Pales, strike a louder tone.		
For some Watch o'er the victualling of the hive, and these By settled order ply their tasks afield; And some within the confines of their home Plant firm the comb's first layer, Narcissus' tear, And sticky gum oozed from the bark of trees, Then set the clinging wax to hang therefrom..But if you dread Too rigorous a winter, and would fain Temper the coming time, and their bruised hearts And broken estate to pity move thy soul, Yet who would fear to fumigate with thyme, Or cut the empty wax away?.GEORGIC IV Of airborn honey, gift of heaven, I now Take up the tale.		
The sun too, both at rising, and when soon He dives beneath the waves, shall yield thee signs; For signs, none trustier, travel with the sun, Both those which in their course with dawn he brings, And those at starrise..What of the youth, when love's relentless might Stirs the fierce fire within his veins?.Why tell how timorous stags the battle join?		
Therefore a second time Philippi saw The Roman hosts with kindred weapons rush To battle, nor did the high gods deem it hard That twice Emathia and the wide champaign Of Haemus should be fattening with our blood..Moreover now nor change of fodder serves, And subtlest cures but injure; then were foiled The masters, Chiron sprung from Phillyron, And Amythaon's son Melampus..Why sing their pastures and the scattered huts They house in?		
When heaven's fourth hour draws on the thickening drought, And shrill cicalas pierce the brake with song, Then at the wellsprings bid them, or deep pools, From troughs of holmoak quaff the running wave: But at day's hottest seek a shadowy vale, Where some vast ancienttimbered oak of Jove Spreads his huge branches, or where huddling black Ilex on ilex cowers in awful shade..Round wooded Silarus and the ilexbowers Of green Alburnus swarms a winged pest Its Roman name Asilus, by the Greeks Termed Oestros fierce it is, and harshly hums, Driving whole herds in terror through the groves, Till heaven is madded by their bellowing din, And Tanager's dry bed and forestbanks..So now the vines are fettered, now the trees Let go the sickle, and the last dresser now Sings of his finished rows; but still the ground Must vexed be, the dust be stirred, and heaven Still set thee trembling for the ripened grapes.		
In the cold season farmers wont to taste The increase of their toil, and yield themselves To mutual interchange of festal cheer..Themselves in deepdug caverns underground Dwell free and careless; to their hearths they heave Oaklogs and elmtrees whole, and fire them there, There play the night out, and in festive glee With barm and service sour the winecup mock..Less thick and fast the whirlwind scours the main With tempest in its wake, than swarm the plagues Of cattle; nor seize they single lives alone, But sudden clear whole feeding grounds, the flock With all its promise, and extirpate the breed.		
Enough of herds..Winter is come: in olivemills they bruise The Sicyonian berry; acorncheered The swine troop homeward; woods their arbutes yield; So, various fruit sheds Autumn, and high up On sunny rocks the mellowing vintage bakes..Apples, moreover, soon as first they feel Their stems wax lusty, and have found their strength, To heaven climb swiftly, selfimpelled, nor crave Our succour.		
Nor e'en the maids, that card their nightly task, Know not the stormsign, when in blazing crock They see the lampoil sputtering with a growth Of mouldy snuffclots..Then, broken at last, let swell their burly frame With fattening cornmash, for, unbroke, they will With pride wax wanton, and, when caught, refuse Tough lash to brook or jagged curb obey..This further task again, to dress the vine, Hath needs beyond exhausting; the whole soil Thrice, four times, yearly must be cleft, the sod With hoes reversed be crushed continually, The whole plantation lightened of its leaves.		
There is a meadowflower by country folk Hight starwort; 'tis a plant not far to seek; For from one sod an ample growth it rears, Itself all golden, but girt with plenteous leaves, Where glory of purple shines through violet gloom..Euphrates here, here Germany new strife Is stirring; neighbouring cities are in arms, The laws that bound them snapped; and godless war Rages through all the universe; as when The fourhorse chariots from the barriers poured Still quicken o'er the course, and, idly now Grasping the reins, the driver by his team Is onward borne, nor heeds the car his curb..Lastly, that Which from shed seed ariseth, upward wins But slowly, yielding promise of its shade To lateborn generations; apples wane Forgetful of their former juice, the grape Bears sorry clusters, for the birds a prey.		
But a soil that's rich, In moisture sweet exulting, and the plain That teems with grasses on its fruitful breast, Such as full oft in hollow mountaindell We view beneath us from the craggy heights Streams thither flow with fertilizing mud A plain which southward rising feeds the fern By curved ploughs detested, this one day Shall yield thee store of vines full strong to gush In torrents of the winegod; this shall be Fruitful of grapes and flowing juice like that We pour to heaven from bowls of gold, what time The sleek Etruscan at the altar blows His ivory pipe, and on the curved dish We lay the reeking entrails..Of tribes Bisaltic such the wonted use, And keen Gelonian, when to Rhodope He flies, or Getic desert, and quaffs milk With horseblood curdled..Hence from their groin slow drips a poisonous juice, By shepherds truly named hippomanes, Hippomanes, fell stepdames oft have culled, And mixed with herbs and spells of baneful bode.		
Nor be thy dogs last cared for; but alike Swift Spartan hounds and fierce Molossian feed On fattening whey..Salt ground again, and bitter, as 'tis called Barren for fruits, by tilth untamable, Nor grape her kind, nor apples their good name Maintaining will in this wise yield thee proof: Stout osierbaskets from the raftersmoke, And strainers of the winepress pluck thee down; Hereinto let that evil land, with fresh Springwater mixed, be trampled to the full; The moisture, mark you, will ooze all away, In big drops issuing through the osierwithes, But plainly will its taste the secret tell, And with a harsh twang ruefully distort The mouths of them that try it..Oft too with oil or apples plentycheap The creeping ass's ribs his driver packs, And home from town returning brings instead A dented millstone or black lump of pitch.		
Hence proceeds That blending of the feathered choirs afield, The cattle's exultation, and the rooks' Deepthroated triumph..Take for a sign the plenteous growth hard by Of oleaster, and the fields strewn wide With woodland berries..One hour for rest have all, and one for toil: With dawn they hurry from the gates no room For loiterers there: and once again, when even Now bids them quit their pasturing on the plain, Then homeward make they, then refresh their strength: A hum arises: hark!		
But if fierce squadrons and the ranks of war Delight thee rather, or on wheels to glide At Pisa, with Alpheus fleeting by, And in the grove of Jupiter urge on The flying chariot, be your steed's first task To face the warrior's armed rage, and brook The trumpet, and long roar of rumbling wheels, And clink of chiming bridles in the stall; Then more and more to love his master's voice Caressing, or loud hand that claps his neck..Nor let mislike me one with spots of white Conspicuous, or that spurns the yoke, whose horn At times hath vice in't: liker bullfaced she, And talllimbed wholly, and with tip of tail Brushing her footsteps as she walks along..If now their narrow home thou wouldst unseal, And broach the treasures of the honeyhouse, With draught of water first toment thy lips, And spread before thee fumes of trailing smoke.		
Hence arose The warhorse stepping proudly o'er the plain; Hence thy white flocks, Clitumnus, and the bull, Of victims mightiest, which full oft have led, Bathed in thy sacred stream, the triumphpomp Of Romans to the temples of the gods..The old have charge To keep the town, and build the walled combs, And mould the cunning chambers; but the youth, Their tired legs packed with thyme, come labouring home Belated, for afar they range to feed On arbutes and the greygreen willowleaves, And cassia and the crocus blushing red, Glueyielding limes, and hyacinths duskyeyed..the hoarse brazen note that warriors know Chides on the loiterers, and the ear may catch A sound that mocks the wartrump's broken blasts; Then in hot haste they muster, then flash wings, Sharpen their pointed beaks and knit their thews, And round the king, even to his royal tent, Throng rallying, and with shouts defy the foe.		
Still will be some, whose form thou fain wouldst change; Renew them still; with yearly choice of young Preventing losses, lest too late thou rue..Some, too, the wardship of the gates befalls, Who watch in turn for showers and cloudy skies, Or ease returning labourers of their load, Or form a band and from their precincts drive The drones, a lazy herd..Oft under longneglected cribs, or lurks A viper ill to handle, that hath fled The light in terror, or some snake, that wont 'Neath shade and sheltering roof to creep, and shower Its bane among the cattle, hugs the ground, Fell scourge of kine.		
Conspicuous by their wings the chiefs themselves Press through the heart of battle, and display A giant's spirit in each pigmy frame, Steadfast no inch to yield till these or those The victor's ponderous arm has turned to flight..But they browse the woods And summits of Lycaeus, and rough briers, And brakes that love the highland: of themselves Right heedfully the shegoats homeward troop Before their kids, and with plump udders clogged Scarce cross the threshold..But if one's whole stock fail him at a stroke, Nor hath he whence to breed the race anew, 'Tis time the wondrous secret to disclose Taught by the swain of Arcady, even how The blood of slaughtered bullocks oft has borne Bees from corruption.		
To whom, strange terror knocking at her heart, "Bring, bring him to our sight," the mother cried; "His feet may tread the threshold even of Gods.".But lo!.Here blooms perpetual spring, and summer here In months that are not summer's; twice teem the flocks; Twice doth the tree yield service of her fruit.		
To him will I, as victor, bravely dight In Tyrian purple, drive along the bank A hundred fourhorse cars..Else, having shorn, they smear their bodies o'er With acrid oillees, and mix silverscum And native sulphur and Idaean pitch, Wax mollified with ointment, and therewith Sealeek, strong hellebores, bitumen black..Willows even and lowly brooms To cattle their green leaves, to shepherds shade, Fences for crops, and food for honey yield.		
All his goods The Afric swain bears with him, house and home, Arms, Cretan quiver, and Amyclaean dog; As some keen Roman in his country's arms Plies the swift march beneath a cruel load; Soon with tents pitched and at his post he stands, Ere looked for by the foe..Or, otherwise, in knotless trunks is hewn A breach, and deep into the solid grain A path with wedges cloven; then fruitful slips Are set herein, and no long time behold!.Media yields The bitter juices and slowlingering taste Of the blest citronfruit, than which no aid Comes timelier, when fierce stepdames drug the cup With simples mixed and spells of baneful power, To drive the deadly poison from the limbs.		
In Sila's forest feeds the heifer fair, While each on each the furious rivals run; Wound follows wound; the black blood laves their limbs; Horns push and strive against opposing horns, With mighty groaning; all the forestside And far Olympus bellow back the roar..Yea, I shall be the first, so life endure, To lead the Muses with me, as I pass To mine own country from the Aonian height; I, Mantua, first will bring thee back the palms Of Idumaea, and raise a marble shrine On thy green plain fast by the waterside, Where Mincius winds more vast in lazy coils, And rims his margent with the tender reed..He too transplanted tallgrown elms arow, Timetoughened pear, thorns bursting with the plum And plane now yielding serviceable shade For dry lips to drink under: but these things, Shut off by rigorous limits, I pass by, And leave for others to sing after me.		
Clio, too, And Beroe, sisters, oceanchildren both, Both zoned with gold and girt with dappled fell, Ephyre and Opis, and from Asian meads Deiopea, and, bow at length laid by, Fleetfooted Arethusa..He it is who warneth oft Of hidden broils at hand and treachery, And secret swelling of the waves of war..He too it was, when Caesar's light was quenched, For Rome had pity, when his bright head he veiled In ironhued darkness, till a godless age Trembled for night eternal; at that time Howbeit earth also, and the oceanplains, And dogs obscene, and birds of evil bode Gave tokens.		
Yet ne'er doth kindlier fortune crown his toil, Than if with blade of iron a man dare lance The ulcer's mouth ope: for the taint is fed And quickened by confinement; while the swain His hand of healing from the wound withholds, Or sits for happier signs imploring heaven..With bleat of flocks and lowings thick resound Rivers and parched banks and sloping heights..And breathing forms of Parian marble there Shall stand, the offspring of Assaracus, And great names of the Jovedescended folk, And father Tros, and Troy's first founder, lord Of Cynthus.		
Let none persuade thee, howso weightywise, To stir the soil when stiff with Boreas' breath..Uptwirling forests with his eddying tide, Madly he bears them down, that lord of floods, Eridanus, till through all the plain are swept Beasts and their stalls together..And be thou At hand, and with me ply the voyage of toil I am bound on, O my glory, O thou that art Justly the chiefest portion of my fame, Maecenas, and on this wide ocean launched Spread sail like wings to waft thee.		
Even as oft In mighty war, whenas the legion's length Deploys its cohorts, and the column stands In open plain, the ranks of battle set, And far and near with rippling sheen of arms The wide earth flickers, nor yet in grisly strife Foe grapples foe, but dubious 'twixt the hosts The wargod wavers; so let all be ranged In equal rows symmetric, not alone To feed an idle fancy with the view, But since not otherwise will earth afford Vigour to all alike, nor yet the boughs Have power to stretch them into open space..At that time In gloomy entrails ceased not to appear Darkthreatening fibres, springs to trickle blood, And highbuilt cities nightlong to resound With the wolves' howling..These with no hounds they hunt, nor net with toils, Nor scare with terror of the crimson plume; But, as in vain they breast the opposing block, Butcher them, knife in hand, and so dispatch Loudbellowing, and with glad shouts hale them home.		
But hard it is To track the signs of that pernicious cold: Pines only, noxious yews, and ivies dark At times reveal its traces..Blest too is he who knows the rural gods, Pan, old Silvanus, and the sisternymphs!.Hail!		
Swift spins the glowing wheel; And now they stoop, and now erect in air Seem borne through space and towering to the sky: No stop, no stay; the dun sand whirls aloft; They reek with foamflakes and pursuing breath; So sweet is fame, so prized the victor's palm..DAMOETAS For me too wrought the same Alcimedon A pair of cups, and round the handles wreathed Pliant acanthus, Orpheus in the midst, The forests following in his wake; nor yet Have I set lip to them, but lay them by..MOERIS                               O Lycidas, We have lived to see, what never yet we feared, An interloper own our little farm, And say, "Be off, you former husbandmen!		
Nay, had I not, from hollow ilexbole Warned by a raven on the left, cut short The rising feud, nor I, your Moeris here, No, nor Menalcas, were alive today..Yet will I, too, in turn, as best I may, Sing thee a song, and to the stars uplift Thy Daphnis Daphnis to the stars extol, For me too Daphnis loved..Foolish Amyntas heard and envied me.		
"Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays..what may not then We lovers look for?.MOPSUS                  What if he also strive To outsing Phoebus?		
Nay, the wild rocks and woods then voiced the roar Of Afric lions mourning for thy death..With these full oft have I seen Moeris change To a wolf's form, and hide him in the woods, Oft summon spirits from the tomb's recess, And to new fields transport the standing corn..Look, look I the very embers of themselves Have caught the altar with a flickering flame, While I delay to fetch them: may the sign Prove lucky!		
Meliboeus?.MENALCAS Naught from the flock I'll venture, for at home I have a father and a stepdame harsh, And twice a day both reckon up the flock, And one withal the kids..Next he sings Of Gallus wandering by Permessus' stream, And by a sister of the Muses led To the Aonian mountains, and how all The choir of Phoebus rose to greet him; how The shepherd Linus, singer of songs divine, Browbound with flowers and bitter parsley, spake: "These reeds the Muses give thee, take them thou, Erst to the aged bard of Ascra given, Wherewith in singing he was wont to draw Timerooted ashtrees from the mountain heights.		
MENALCAS "Say in what country grow such flowers as bear The names of kings upon their petals writ, And you shall have fair Phyllis for your own.".ECLOGUE VI TO VARUS First my Thalia stooped in sportive mood To Syracusan strains, nor blushed within The woods to house her.."Such still, such ages weave ye, as ye run," Sang to their spindles the consenting Fates By Destiny's unalterable decree.		
Gather your flock together, Tityrus," You hid behind the sedges..Do you first, Damoetas, sing, Then you, Menalcas, in alternate strain: Alternate strains are to the Muses dear..For him, on whom his parents have not smiled, Gods deem not worthy of their board or bed.		
MENALCAS You outpipe him?.You scorn me, Alexis, who or what I am Care not to ask how rich in flocks, or how In snowwhite milk abounding: yet for me Roam on Sicilian hills a thousand lambs; Summer or winter, still my milkpails brim..MELIBOEUS These I remember, and how Thyrsis strove For victory in vain.		
ECLOGUE III MENALCAS   DAMOETAS   PALAEMON MENALCAS Who owns the flock, Damoetas?.MENALCAS "Forbear, my sheep, to tread too near the brink; Yon bank is ill to trust to; even now The ram himself, see, dries his dripping fleece!".These herbs of bane to me did Moeris give, In Pontus culled, where baneful herbs abound.		
MOERIS Heard it you had, and so the rumour ran, But 'mid the clash of arms, my Lycidas, Our songs avail no more than, as 'tis said, Doves of Dodona when an eagle comes..DAMOETAS "Prithee, Iollas, for my birthday guest Send me your Phyllis; when for the young crops I slay my heifer, you yourself shall come.".Nay, though Pan, With Arcady for judge, my claim contest, With Arcady for judge great Pan himself Should own him foiled, and from the field retire.		
Who would not sing for Gallus?.What misery have I brought upon my head! Loosed on the flowers Siroces to my bane, And the wild boar upon my crystal springs!.Thus Damon: but do ye, Pierian Maids We cannot all do all things tell me how Alphesiboeus to his strain replied.		
ECLOGUE V MENALCAS   MOPSUS MENALCAS Why, Mopsus, being both together met, You skilled to breathe upon the slender reeds, I to sing ditties, do we not sit down Here where the elmtrees and the hazels blend?.Laughing at their guile, And crying, "Why tie the fetters?.ten months of weariness For thee she bore: O babyboy, begin!		
The serpent too shall die, Die shall the treacherous poisonplant, and far And wide Assyrian spices spring..DAMOETAS Nay, they are Aegon's sheep, of late by him Committed to my care.."Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays.		
CORYDON "Ye mossy springs, and grass more soft than sleep, And arbute green with thin shade sheltering you, Ward off the solstice from my flock, for now Comes on the burning summer, now the buds Upon the limber vineshoot 'gin to swell.".Look you how the cave Is with the wild vine's clusters overlaced!.What was I to do?		
Who then of the Nymphs had sung, Or who with flowering herbs bestrewn the ground, And o'er the fountains drawn a leafy veil? Who sung the stave I filched from you that day To Amaryllis wending, our hearts' joy? "While I am gone, 'tis but a little way, Feed, Tityrus, my goats, and, having fed, Drive to the drinkingpool, and, as you drive, Beware the hegoat; with his horn he butts.".DAMOETAS "What words to me, and uttered O how oft, Hath Galatea spoke!.No Phyllis or Alcippe left at home Had I, to shelter my newweaned lambs, And no slight matter was a singingbout 'Twixt Corydon and Thyrsis.		
The unshorn mountains to the stars uptoss Voices of gladness; ay, the very rocks, The very thickets, shout and sing, 'A god, A god is he, Menalcas "Be thou kind, Propitious to thine own..MOPSUS You are the elder, 'tis for me to bide Your choice, Menalcas, whether now we seek Yon shade that quivers to the changeful breeze, Or the cave's shelter..when had you ever pipe Waxwelded?		
I looked, and I was lost; A sudden frenzy swept my wits away..MENALCAS As limber willow to pale olive yields, As lowly Celtic nard to rosebuds bright, So, to my mind, Amyntas yields to you..Here glows the Spring, here earth Beside the streams pours forth a thousand flowers; Here the white poplar bends above the cave, And the lithe vine weaves shadowy covert: come, Leave the mad waves to beat upon the shore."		
Only do thou, at the boy's birth in whom The iron shall cease, the golden race arise, Befriend him, chaste Lucina; 'tis thine own Apollo reigns..MENALCAS "Pollio himself too doth new verses make: Feed ye a bull now ripe to butt with horn, And scatter with his hooves the flying sand.".My twelfth year I scarce had entered, and could barely reach The brittle boughs.		
THYRSIS "Arcadian shepherds, wreathe with ivyspray Your budding poet, so that Codrus burst With envy: if he praise beyond my due, Then bind my brow with foxglove, lest his tongue With evil omen blight the coming bard.".Wherefore the woods and fields, Pan, shepherdfolk, And Dryadmaidens, thrill with eager joy; Nor wolf with treacherous wile assails the flock, Nor nets the stag: kind Daphnis loveth peace.."Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays.		
ECLOGUE VIII TO POLLIO   DAMON   ALPHESIBOEUS Of Damon and Alphesiboeus now, Those shepherdsingers at whose rival strains The heifer wondering forgot to graze, The lynx stood awestruck, and the flowing streams, Unwonted loiterers, stayed their course to hear How Damon and Alphesiboeus sang Their pastoral ditties, will I tell the tale..Howsoe'er, I let my business wait upon their sport..Whom do you fly, infatuate?		
LYCIDAS                       But surely I had heard That where the hills first draw from off the plain, And the high ridge with gentle slope descends, Down to the brookside and the broken crests Of yonder veteran beeches, all the land Was by the songs of your Menalcas saved..the boy himself Was worthy to be sung, and many a time Hath Stimichon to me your singing praised..CORYDON "The poplar doth Alcides hold most dear, The vine Iacchus, Phoebus his own bays, And Venus fair the myrtle: therewithal Phyllis doth hazels love, and while she loves, Myrtle nor bay the hazel shall outvie."		
MENALCAS With thieves so daring, what can masters do?.LYCIDAS Alack!.Matched with a heifer, who would prate of cups?		
soon shall we see mate Griffins with mares, and in the coming age Shy deer and hounds together come to drink..Alack!.CORYDON "The junipers and prickly chestnuts stand, And 'neath each tree lie strewn their several fruits, Now the whole world is smiling, but if fair Alexis from these hillslopes should away, Even the rivers you would ; see run dry."		
THYRSIS "Here is a hearth, and resinous logs, here fire Unstinted, and doors black with ceaseless smoke..When I sought to tell Of battles and of kings, the Cynthian god Plucked at mine ear and warned me: "Tityrus, Beseems a shepherdwight to feed fat sheep, But sing a slender song.".the notes I still Remember, could I but recall the words.		
With thee began, to thee shall end, the strain..Therewith a second Tiphys shall there be, Her herofreight a second Argo bear; New wars too shall arise, and once again Some great Achilles to some Troy be sent.."Begin, my flute, with me Maenalian lays.		
soothed Pasiphae with the love of her white bull Happy if cattlekind had never been! O illstarred maid, what frenzy caught thy soul The daughters too of Proetus filled the fields With their feigned lowings, yet no one of them Of such unhallowed union e'er was fain As with a beast to mate, though many a time On her smooth forehead she had sought for horns, And for her neck had feared the galling plough..Now, the pears; So shall your children's children pluck their fruit..We know who once, and in what shrine with you The hegoats looked aside the light nymphs laughed MENALCAS Ay, then, I warrant, when they saw me slash Micon's young vines and trees with spiteful hook.		
Long as the wild boar Shall love the mountainheights, and fish the streams, While bees on thyme and crickets feed on dew, Thy name, thy praise, thine honour, shall endure..in the crossways used you not On grating straw some miserable tune To mangle?.gods ere now, And Dardan Paris, have made the woods their home.		
Ah!."Draw from the town, my songs, draw Daphnis home..We are halfway thither, for Bianor's tomb Begins to show: here, Moeris, where the hinds Are lopping the thick leafage, let us sing.
