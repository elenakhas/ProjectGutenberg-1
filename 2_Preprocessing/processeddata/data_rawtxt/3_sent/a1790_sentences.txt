In the case of a writer like Horace it is not easy to draw an exact line; but though in the Odes our admiration of much that is graceful and tender and even true may balance our moral repugnance to many parts of the poet's philosophy of life, it does not seem equally desirable to dwell minutely on a class of compositions where the beauties are fewer and the deformities more numerous and more undisguised..Meantime his lovesick hostess' messenger        Talks of the flames that waste poor Chloe's heart           (Flames lit for you, not her!).O NATE MECUM.

How should a mortal's hopes be long, when short his being's date?.Who curbs a greedy soul may boast        More power than if his broadbased throne      Bridged Libya's sea, and either coast            Were all his own..He well compares Lucretius, Book I, v. 927         "Juvatque novas decerpere flores,      Insignemque meo capiti petere inde coronam      Unde prius nulli velarint tempora Musae."

Honour to Proculeius!.Whatwhen mad Agave carries the amputated head of her unhappy son, does she then seem mad to herself?.Not that I bear an illwill against Livy's epics, and would doom them to destruction, which I remember the severe Orbilius taught me when a boy; but they should seem correct, beautiful, and very little short of perfect, this I wonder at: among which if by chance a bright expression shines forth, and if one line or two [happen to be] somewhat terse and musical, this unreasonably carries off and sells the whole poem.
