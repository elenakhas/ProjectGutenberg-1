[A SOUND OF WAVES IS HEARD.].The lightning is his slave; heaven's utmost deep Gives up her stars, and like a flock of sheep They pass before his eye, are numbered, and roll on!.1130 He paused, and to my lips he bent His own: like spirit his words went Through all my limbs with the speed of fire; And his keen eyes, glittering through mine, Filled me with the flame divine,                                     1135 Which in their orbs was burning far, Like the light of an unmeasured star, In the sky of midnight dark and deep: Yes, 'twas his soul that did inspire Sounds, which my skill could ne'er awaken;                           1140 And first, I felt my fingers sweep The harp, and a long quivering cry Burst from my lips in symphony: The dusk and solid air was shaken, As swift and swifter the notes came                                  1145 From my touch, that wandered like quick flame, And from my bosom, labouring With some unutterable thing: The awful sound of my own voice made My faint lips tremble; in some mood                                  1150 Of wordless thought Lionel stood So pale, that even beside his cheek The snowy column from its shade Caught whiteness: yet his countenance, Raised upward, burned with radiance                                  1155 Of spiritpiercing joy, whose light, Like the moon struggling through the night Of whirlwindrifted clouds, did break With beams that might not be confined.

But more he loathed and hated the clear light Of wisdom and free thought, and more did fear, Lest, kindled once, its beams might pierce the night, Even where his Idol stood; for, far and near Did many a heart in Europe leap to hear                              4085 That faith and tyranny were trampled down; Many a pale victim, doomed for truth to share The murderer's cell, or see, with helpless groan, The priests his children drag for slaves to serve their own..4445 We grant thy boon.'.CHORUS OF PRIESTS, ACCOMPANIED BY THE COURT PORKMAN ON MARROWBONES AND CLEAVERS: GODDESS bare, and gaunt, and pale, Empress of the world, all hail!

In other respects, I have written more carelessly; that is, without an overfastidious and learned choice of words..My purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence; aware that until the mind can love, and admire, and trust, and hope, and endure, reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust, although they would bear the harvest of his happiness..He is made one with Nature: there is heard                           370 His voice in all her music, from the moan Of thunder, to the song of night's sweet bird; He is a presence to be felt and known In darkness and in light, from herb and stone, Spreading itself where'er that Power may move                        375 Which has withdrawn his being to its own; Which wields the world with neverwearied love, Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it above.

Speak to me, Unlock those pallid hands whose fingers twine With one another..Your own hands have built an home, Even for yourselves on a beloved shore: For some, fond eyes are pining till they come, How they will greet him when his toils are o'er, And laughing babes rush from the wellknown door!.All inndoors and windows                                            230 Were open to me: I saw all that sin does, Which lamps hardly see That burn in the night by the curtained bed, The impudent lamps!		
I send you a translation of the Italian manuscript on which my play is founded; the chief circumstance of which I have touched very delicately; for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape, however treated, would be admitted on the stage..MAMMON: I wonder that gray wizards                                           340 Like you should be so beardless in their schemes; It had been but a point of policy To keep Iona and the Swine apart..could hardly appear sufficient for so long a journey.		
This superior cleanliness is chiefly produced by the difference of religion: travellers in Germany remark the same contrast between the protestant and catholic towns, although they be but a few leagues separate..The direction of this lake extends at first from east to west, then turning a right angle, it lies from north to south; this latter part is distinguished in name from the other, and is called the lake of Uri..To the warm sunshine and to the humming of sunloving insects.		
The peasants of Switzerland may not however emulate the vivacity and grace of the French..We saw again, and for the last time, the rocky shores of this beautiful lake, its verdant isles, and snowcapt mountains..Leaving Hermance, we arrived at sunset at the village of Nerni.		
The place where the Rhone joins the lake was marked by a line of tremendous breakers; the river is as rapid as when it leaves the lake, but is muddy and dark..As we prepared our dinner in a place, so filthy that the sight of it alone was sufficient to destroy our appetite, the people of the village collected around us, squalid with dirt, their countenances expressing every thing that is disgusting and brutal..Bonneville is a neat little town, with no conspicuous peculiarity, except the white towers of the prison, an extensive building overlooking the town.		
The scene, at the distance of half a mile from Cluses, differs from that of Matlock in little else than in the immensity of its proportions, and in its untameable, inaccessible solitude, inhabited only by the goats which we saw browsing on the rocks..Pinnacles of snow intolerably bright, part of the chain connected with Mont Blanc, shone through the clouds at intervals on high..The cabin of Montanvert is three leagues from Chamouni, half of which distance is performed on mules, not so sure footed, but that on the first day the one which I rode fell in what the guides call a mauvais pas, so that I narrowly escaped being precipitated down the mountain.		
After winding through the valley, we began to ascend the mountains which were its boundary: we left our voiture, and walked on, delighted with every new view that broke upon us..Across one of these arches was a beam, now black and rotten, on which prisoners were hung in secret..The high mountains encompassed us, darkening the waters; at a distance on the shores of Uri we could perceive the chapel of Tell, and this was the village where he matured the conspiracy which was to overthrow the tyrant of his country; and indeed this lovely lake, these sublime mountains, and wild forests, seemed a fit cradle for a mind aspiring to high adventure and heroic deeds.		
The scene assumes here a more savage and colossal character; the valley becomes narrow, affording no more space than is sufficient for the river and the road..We ascended, winding between mountains whose immensity staggers the imagination..When we approached near to it, the rain of the spray reached us, and our clothes were wetted by the quickfalling but minute particles of water.		
One date was as ancient as 1670..We now inhabit a little cottage on the opposite shore of the lake, and have exchanged the view of Mont Blanc and her snowy aiguilles for the dark frowning Jura, behind whose range we every evening see the sun sink, and darkness approaches our valley from behind the Alps, which are then tinged by that glowing roselike hue which is observed in England to attend on the clouds of an autumnal sky when daylight is almost gone..Through some delay, which had arisen from the ship having got aground in the harbour, we arrived half an hour after the appointed time.		
The theme of their ballads consists of shepherds, love, flocks, and the sons of kings who fall in love with beautiful shepherdesses..We gathered roses on the terrace, in the feeling that they might be the posterity of some planted by Julia's hand..SWITZERLAND.		
The lake is at our feet, and a little harbour contains our boat, in which we still enjoy our evening excursions on the water..which we possessed, was all the money that we could count upon with any certainty, until the following December..Why did the cold maxims of the world compel me at this moment to repress the tears of melancholy transport which it would have been so sweet to indulge, immeasurably, even until the darkness of night had swallowed up the objects which excited them?		
His countenance was beautiful for the expression with which it overflowed..They were created indeed by one mind, but a mind so powerfully bright as to cast a shade of falsehood on the records that are called reality..On quitting the walls, the road wound underneath a high precipice; on the other side the hills rose more gradually, and the green valley that intervened between them was watered by a pleasant river; before us arose an amphitheatre of hills covered with vines, but irregular and rocky.		
We were travelling along the valley, when suddenly we heard a sound as of the burst of smothered thunder rolling above; yet there was something earthly in the sound, that told us it could not be thunder..Before we slept, we secured places in the diligence, which was to depart next morning for Clêves..One had fallen the preceding day, a little time after we had returned: our guides desired us to pass quickly, for it is said that sometimes the least sound will accelerate their descent.		
M.                               LETTER III..The river was rapid, and sped swiftly, breaking as it passed on innumerable rocks just covered by the water: it was a sight of some dread to see our frail boat winding among the eddies of the rocks, which it was death to touch, and when the slightest inclination on one side would instantly have overset it..We saw on the shores few objects that called forth our attention, if I except the town of Manheim, which was strikingly neat and clean.		
We passed through the champain country, which extends from Mont Salève to the base of the higher Alps..You know that we have just escaped from the gloom of winter and of London; and coming to this delightful spot during this divine weather, I feel as happy as a newfledged bird, and hardly care what twig I fly to, so that I may try my newfound wings..The road lay over a desart plain, and as night advanced we were often in danger of losing the track of wheels, which was our only guide.		
we should soon be reduced to absolute want..Gentlemens' seats are scattered over these banks, behind which rise the various ridges of black mountains, and towering far above, in the midst of its snowy Alps, the majestic Mont Blanc, highest and queen of all..but there was no other alternative, and indeed S*** only knew how very little we had to depend upon.		
We had not proceeded far before the rain began to fall, but we persisted until we had accomplished more than half of our journey, when we returned, wet through..One winter night an avalanche overwhelmed them, but their plaintive voices are still heard in stormy nights, calling for succour from the peasants..Waterfalls echo from the cliffs, and shine afar.		
Probably the village derives its name from this production..Water conveyances are always the cheapest, and fortunately we were so situated, that by taking advantage of the rivers of the Reuss and Rhine, we could reach England without travelling a league on land..I never felt more strongly than on landing at Clarens, that the spirit of old times had deserted its once cherished habitation.		
About nine o'clock we departed..Nature was the poet, whose harmony held our spirits more breathless than that of the divinest..LETTER I.                                               Hôtel de Secheron, Geneva,                                                     May 17, 1816.		
My feelings would have been less painful had I been alone; but I know that my companion would have attempted to save me, and I was overcome with humiliation, when I thought that his life might have been risked to preserve mine..She had lately recovered from a fever, and this added to the interest of her countenance, by adorning it with an appearance of extreme delicacy..We arrived however safe at Mellerie, after passing with great speed mighty forests which overhung the lake, and lawns of exquisite verdure, and mountains with bare and icy points, which rose immediately from the summit of the rocks, whose bases were echoing to the waves.		
It was evening, and the laden clouds made the darkness almost as deep as that of midnight; but in the west an unusually brilliant and fiery redness occupied an opening in the vapours, and added to the interest of our little expedition: the cottage lights were reflected in the tranquil river, and the dark hills behind, dimly seen, resembled vast and frowning mountains..These prisons are excavated below the lake; the principal dungeon is supported by seven columns, whose branching capitals support the roof..Nothing could be more barren and wretched than the track through which we now passed; the ground was chalky and uncovered even by grass, and where there had been any attempts made towards cultivation, the straggling ears of corn discovered more plainly the barren nature of the soil.		
After having travelled for two days through a country perfectly without interest, it was a delicious relief for the eye to dwell again on some irregularities and beauty of country..From the windows of our hotel we see the lovely lake, blue as the heavens which it reflects, and sparkling with golden beams..This approach to mountain scenery filled us with delight; it was otherwise with our voiturier: he came from the plains of Troyes, and these hills so utterly scared him, that he in some degree lost his reason.		
My companion gave him a piece of money, which he took without speaking, with a sweet smile of easy thankfulness, and then with an unembarrassed air turned to his play..She would not have been surprised if I had talked of the burning sun and delicious fruits of December, or of the frosts of July..The waters of the Rhone are blue, those of the Reuss are of a deep green.		
I remained at the inn writing, while S*** and C*** arranged this bargain and visited the cathedral of the town; and the next morning we departed in our voiture for Neufchâtel..I felt in this near prospect of death a mixture of sensations, among which terror entered, though but subordinately..It struck the head of the visionary image, and gracefully dividing there, fell from it in folds of foam more like to cloud than water, imitating a veil of the most exquisite woof.		
The mountains of this beautiful ravine are so little asunder, that in time of war with France an iron chain is thrown across it..This conveyance appeared much more like a mercantile English affair than any we had before seen; it was shaped like a steamboat, with a cabin and a high deck..Having formed this resolution, we had not a moment for delay: our little store was sensibly decreasing, and £28.		
Chamouni, July 25th..S***'s ancle had become very painful, but we could procure no conveyance, and as the sun was nearly setting, we were obliged to hasten on..The walls are immensely solid, and the stone of which it is built so hard, that it yet retained the mark of chisels.		
We have not yet found out any very agreeable walks, but you know our attachment to water excursions..Many villages, ruined by the war, occupied the most romantic spots..It was situated at about a mile from the river, and the road to it was planted on each side with beautiful acacias.		
The last gate of the town was cut through the precipitous rock that arose on one side, and in that place jutted into the road..We dined at Servoz, a little village, where there are lead and copper mines, and where we saw a cabinet of natural curiosities, like those of Keswick and Bethgelert..There were only four passengers besides ourselves, three of these were students of the Strasburgh university: Schwitz, a rather handsome, good tempered young man; Hoff, a kind of shapeless animal, with a heavy, ugly, German face; and Schneider, who was nearly an ideot, and on whom his companions were always playing a thousand tricks: the remaining passengers were a woman, and an infant.		
We passed over a hollow covered with snow, down which vast stones are accustomed to roll..We remained the following day at this town, occupied in a consideration of the step it would now be advisable for us to take..It gave us new strength to proceed; but it was a wretched place, and afforded us but little relief.		
As we left Vandeuvres the aspect of the country suddenly changed; abrupt hills, covered with vineyards, intermixed with trees, enclosed a narrow valley, the channel of the Aube..The giant's steel club rebounded from my body; the executioner's hand could not strangle me, the tiger's tooth could not pierce me, nor would the hungry lion in the circus devour me..I hear music on the zephyr's wing,                             10 Louder it floats along the unruffled sky; Some fairy sure has touched the viewless string Now faint in distant air the murmurs die.

I'll tell thee a part Of the thoughts that start To being when thou art nigh; And thy beauty, more bright                                          10 Than the stars' soft light, Shall seem as a weft from the sky..Then thou becam'st, a boy, More daring in thy frenzies: every shape,                            80 Monstrous or vast, or beautifully wild, Which, from sensation's relics, fancy culls The spirits of the air, the shuddering ghost, The genii of the elements, the powers That give a shape to Nature's varied works,                          85 Had life and place in the corrupt belief Of thy blind heart: yet still thy youthful hands Were pure of human blood..must our punishment Be endless?		
I am mad with joy at your device..Water of purest hue On earth, would appear turbid and impure Compared with this, whose unconcealing dew,                          30 Dark, dark, yet clear, moved under the obscure Eternal shades, whose interwoven looms The rays of moon or sunlight ne'er endure..'Oh!		
The word liberty, as applied to mind, is analogous to the word chance as applied to matter: they spring from an ignorance of the certainty of the conjunction of antecedents and consequents..When a proposition is offered to the mind, it perceives the agreement or disagreement of the ideas of which it is composed..Let the advocate of animal food force himself to a decisive experiment on its fitness, and, as Plutarch recommends, tear a living lamb with his teeth, and plunging his head into its vitals slake his thirst with the steaming blood; when fresh from the deed of horror, let him revert to the irresistible instincts of nature that would rise in judgement against it, and say, 'Nature formed me for such work as this.'		
SILENUS: Babai!.JUNE, 1810..And if any soft passion be near, Which mortals, frail mortals, can know, Let love shed on the bosom a tear,                                   80 And dissolve the chill icedrop of woe.		
JULIAN AND MADDALO..Awhile thou stoodst Baffled and gloomy; then thou didst sum up The elements of all that thou didst know;                            95 The changing seasons, winter's leafless reign, The budding of the Heavenbreathing trees, The eternal orbs that beautify the night, The sunrise, and the setting of the moon, Earthquakes and wars, and poisons and disease,                       100 And all their causes, to an abstract point Converging, thou didst bend and called it God!....and now We are embarkedthe mountains hang and frown Over the starry deep that gleams below, A vast and dim expanse, as o'er the waves we go.

I had never lived before, But now those blisses are no more..40 Now swells the intermingling din; the jar Frequent and frightful of the bursting bomb; The falling beam, the shriek, the groan, the shout, The ceaseless clangour, and the rush of men Inebriate with rage:loud, and more loud                            45 The discord grows; till pale Death shuts the scene, And o'er the conqueror and the conquered draws His cold and bloody shroud.Of all the men Whom day's departing beam saw blooming there, In proud and vigorous health; of all the hearts                      50 That beat with anxious life at sunset there; How few survive, how few are beating now!.I can scarce rise.		
20 Spare nothing but a gloomy theme, On which the lightest heart might moralize?.The language spoken, however, by the mythology of nearly all religions seems to prove that at some distant period man forsook the path of nature, and sacrificed the purity and happiness of his being to unnatural appetites..If all that lives must love or die,                                  30 All shapes on earth, or sea, or sky, With one consent to Heaven cry That the glory far above All else in life is ALL: Love!		
FLORO: It seems Much to me that the light of day should look Upon that idol of my heartbut he                                 265 Leave us to fight, according to thy word..Law pretends even to govern the indisciplinable wanderings of passion, to put fetters on the clearest deductions of reason, and, by appeals to the will, to subdue the involuntary affections of our nature..Iliad Z, line 146.		
And statesmen boast Of wealth!.There an inhuman and uncultured race Howled hideous praises to their DemonGod;                           150 They rushed to war, tore from the mother's womb The unborn child,old age and infancy Promiscuous perished; their victorious arms Left not a soul to breathe..; "Poetical Works", 1839, 1st edition reads destined: soft emotion Attracts, etc.		
12. own..Hist.".MORTAL: Mine eyelids are heavy; my soul seeks repose, It longs in thy cells to embosom its woes, It longs in thy cells to deposit its load,                           15 Where no longer the scorpions of Perfidy goad, Where the phantoms of Prejudice vanish away, And Bigotry's bloodhounds lose scent of their prey.
