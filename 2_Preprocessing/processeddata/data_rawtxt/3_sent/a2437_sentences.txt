These did frankly loot a provinceNorth Africaand they (and they alone of the auxiliary troops) did revolt against the Imperial system and defy it for a century: but the Vandals themselves were already, before their adventure, a part of the Imperial forces; they were but a nucleus for a mixed host made up of all the varied elements of rebellion present in the country; and their experiment in separation went down at last forever before the Imperial armies..There was one unending series of attacks, Pagan and Mohammedan, from the North, from the East and from the South; attacks not comparable to the older raids of external hordes, eager only to enjoy civilization within the Empire, small in number and yet ready to accept the faith and customs of Europe..In other words, we are certain that the little pagan courts settled on the east coast of Britain were balanced by a remaining mass of declining Roman civilization elsewhere, and that there was no attempt at anything like expansion or conquest from the east westward.		
In Spain, in Gaul, in Italy, as in Africa, economic power had concentrated into the hands of exceedingly few men..Such a point of view is wrong historically as it is wrong in morals..The transformation of the Roman Empire, then, in the fourth century and the fifth was eventually its preservation, in peril of full decay, by its acceptation of the Faith.		
if it be in the spiritual order (as are all major things), the reader must attempt his own reply based upon other aptitudes than those of historic science..[Footnote: For instance, there is no contemporary account mentioning London during the last half of the fifth and nearly all the sixth century..[Footnote: The single sentence in Prosper is insignificantand what is more, demonstrably false as it stands.]		
For instance, our first knowledge of Teutonic dialect is of the eighth century (the socalled Early Gothic is a fraud) but even then quite half the words or more are truly German, apparently unaffected by the Imperial laws and speech.].It is not credible that a man of this weight would write as he does without solid tradition behind him; and he tells us that the settlers on this coast of Britain came from three lowland Frisian tribes, German and Danish, called Saxons, Jutes and Angles..The islands of the Mediterranean fell.		
The thing is not physically impossible, but it is so exceedingly improbable that common sense laughs at it.].The conception of representative assembly, monastic in origin, fruitfully transferred to civilian soil, appears in the institutions of Christendom..Now the point to seize is this: Inimical as such a revolt was to souls or (to speak upon the mere historical plane) to civilization, bad as it was that the tide of culture should have begun to ebb from the far regions which it had once so beneficently flooded, the Reformation, that is, the reaction against the unity, the discipline, and the clear thought of Europe, would never have counted largely in human affairs had it been confined to the external fringe of the civilized world.		
The "Rex" of, say, Batavian auxiliaries, the commander of the Batavian Corps, would probably be a man of Batavian blood, with hereditary position and would be called "Rex Bataviorum.".The city which had arrived at such a position, and which was now the manifest capital of the Italian scheme, was ROME..If he were, as a small minority even of the rich already were, in sympathy with it though not of it, it would still have concerned him.		
It means (1) The chieftain of an auxiliary group of soldiers who holds an Imperial commission: and it means (2) That man acting as a local governor..In Geneva Calvin was a god..There is, on the contrary, a very definite and clearly marked historical sequence between Roman civilization and the feudal system, attested by innumerable documents which, once read and compared in their order, leave no sort of doubt that feudalism and the mediæval civilization repose on purely Roman origins.		
On the analogy of all similar experiments we can be fairly certain of what happened, though there is no contemporary record of such domestic details in the case of Normandy..was small compared with the numbers of civilization, and, I repeat, in the eyes of the citizens of the Empire, their lack of culture made them more insignificant still..But that thesis still tries to make out a plausible case when it speaks of Britain, because so much of the record here is lost that there is more room for makebelieve; and having made it out, the tale of a German and barbaric England, his false result will powerfully affect modern and immediate conclusions upon our common civilization, upon our institutions, and their nature, and in particular upon the Faith and its authority in Europe.		
It is this: the Dark Ages were the point during which there very gradually germinated and came into outward existence things which still remain among us and help to differentiate our Christendom from the past of classical antiquity..Our Christian and Roman culture proceeds continuously eastward, mastering the uncouth..It was not savage like the Germanies; it was therefore under no necessity to go to school.		
In the second phase (which corresponded with the beginning of a decline in letters and in the arts, which carries us through the welter of civil wars in the third century and which introduces the remodeled Empire at their close) the Army was becoming purely professional and at the same time drawn from whatever was least fortunate in Roman society..Always they prove themselves before posterity to have done much more than any other mold of man..In the case of local Italian government the case is quite clear.		
As with destruction, so with decay, there is no increasing proportion as we go from the west eastward towards the Pirate settlements..The name most prominently associated with the crisis is that of Martin Luther, an Augustinian monk, German by birth and speech, and one of those exuberant sensual, rather inconsequential, characters which so easily attract hearty friendships, and which can never pretend to organization or command, though certainly to creative power..Of this sort was ancient Egypt.		
They never dreamt of "conquest.".The bread and wine so consecrated were certainly called (universally) the Body of the Lord..Gaul was to preserve all that could be preserved of the material side of Europe, and also of the European spirit.		
In so far as it existed it would have been on all fours with any one of the vague opinions which floated about the cultured Roman world..That command was long absolute and Carthaginian power depended on it wholly..How came there to be also nations exterior to the Empire; old nations like Ireland, new nations like Poland?		
[Footnote: I wrote that phrase before the break up of Prussia and at a moment when Prussia was still the idol of Oxford.].They still thought of themselves, in 550, say, as mere provincial powers within the one great Empire of Rome..A rim of such points encircled the eastern and central Mediterranean wherever it was habitable by man.		
A man's belief in the mission of the Catholic Church, his confidence in its divine origin, do not move him to these plain historical conclusions any more than they move him to his conclusions upon the real existence, doctrine and organization of contemporary Mormonism..It was not a morass of shifting tribes; it was a nation..Europe is the Church, and the Church is Europe.		
But there was nothing uncommon in a slave being treated as a friend, in his being a member of the liberal professions, in his acting as a tutor, as an administrator of his master's fortune, or a doctor..Letters, in the finer sense, almost ceased..The Church may have taught nonsense.		
That is a fair presentment of the manner in which a number of local affairs (including the Catholic Church in his city) would have struck such a man at such a time..We have seen that the administration of these local governments usually devolved on the chief officers of the auxiliary barbarian troops, who were also, as a rule, their chieftains by some kind of inheritance..It is a feature which nearly all historians neglect and yet one manifest upon the reading of any contemporary expression.		
He bases his right to his government upon the possession of great estates within the area of that government..These brought with them all the strength of those native virtues which later rejected the unity of Christendom and began the modern Protestant societieswhich are already nearly atheist and very soon will be wholly so..Stilicho, the great rival general (himself, by the way, a Vandal in descent), admitted Alaric's right to arrears of pay, but just at that moment there occurred an obscure palace intrigue which was based, like all the real movements of the time, on differences of religion, not of race.		
He had already married a Christian wife, the daughter of the Burgundian Rex; but in any case such a conclusion was inevitable..They appear universally among the Iberians as among the Celts, among the pure Germans beyond the Rhine, the mixed Franks and Batavians upon the delta of that river, and the lowlands of the Scheldt and the Meuse; even among the untouched Roman populations..Speaking as Catholics, we know that the ultimate causes were more profound.		
Because it was in essence founded upon the most intimate appetites of European men..The great invasion under Radagasius interrupts this civil war..The motive of it is not history, but the reformation of morals.		
A very large number of converts were to be noted and (to go back to Tertullian) the majority of his time, by his testimony, were recruited by conversion, and were not born Christians..The close succession of fruit and decay in society is what one expects from the analogy of all living things: at the close of the cycle it is death that should come..Of our institutions it is the same story.		
The Mohammedan world was as cultured as our own in its first expansion..till Fontenoy..The news would never for a moment have suggested to him any coming danger to the society in which he lived.		
And in connection with that intense preoccupation of men's minds, two factors already appear in the fourth century and are increasingly active through the fifth and sixth..When even the miraculous appears in a recordif its human evidence is multiple, converging and exactI must accept it or deny the value of human evidence..In cooking, dress, architecture, law, and the rest, all the world was Roman.		
With the Creed there came to these outer parts reading and writing, building in brick and stoneall the material essentials of our civilizationand what is characteristic of that culture, the power of thinking more clearly..The host is not of that opinion; he has been profoundly influenced by certain "mysteries" into which he has been "initiated:" That is, symbolical plays showing the fate of the soul and performed in high seclusion before members of a society sworn to secrecy..Had you proposed it they would not even have known what you meant.		
All architecture is transformed, and that quite new thing, the Gothic, arises..With the beginning of the eleventh century, as everything was springing into new life, when the great saint who, from the chair of Peter, was to restore the Church was already born, when the advance of the Pyreneans against Islam was beginning to strike its decisive conquering blows, there appeared, a sudden phenomenon, this new thingFrench in speech and habit and disposition of body, yet just differentiated from the rest of Frenchmenthe Norman Race..So it would have beenbut for one master tragedy, which changed the whole scheme.		
This defeat of the pagan Pirates at Mt..The Empire had had trouble with it in the past, but that trouble was long forgotten; the little colonies of Jews had become negotiators, highly separate from their fellow citizens, already unpopular, but nothing more..Hence all our original documents and prayers are Greek and shine with a Greek light: nor are any so essentially Greek in idea as the four Catholic Gospels.		
He is talking of what is, virtually, his own time..Armed with this knowledge (which puts an end to any fantastic theory of barbarian "conquest"), let us set out to explain that state of affairs which a man born, say, a hundred years after the last of the mere raids into the Empire was destroyed under Radagasius, would have observed in middle age..There were battles near Bath and battles near Chester, the loot of a city, a counter raid by the Westerners and all the rest of it.		
The great Roman landed estates, with their masses of dependents and slaves, under a lord or owner, had never disappeared..The real division right up to full tide of feudalism was Christian and Pagan, and, within the former, Eastern and Western: Greek and Latin.]."I think I must have given it up to the man," he answered doubtfully, "the guard who told me that the next station was Chartres."		
That was my plan..The Gorilla is universally accepted, and if we have won the battle for the Gorilla, the rest will follow..Everything lends itself to this: the skilled labour could be imparted from home, the sardines from France, and the tin and oil from Spain.		
He offered us cigars..As I approached the building I saw that there gathered round it a village, or rather a group of dependent houses; for the church was so much larger than anything in the place, and the material of which the church itself and the habitations were built was so similar, the flat old tiled roofs all mixed under the advance of darkness into so united a body, that one would have said, as was perhaps historically the truth, that the church was not built for the needs of the place, but that the borough had grown round the shrine, and had served for little save to house its servants..The bridge that trembles most is the Bridge of Piacenza.		
Ormond, my dear lad, bear me no illwill..Let me therefore see that these young men are instructed and baptized, after which you may exercise your cruel will.".It is a whole world.		
The commander of the post was not what you might expect, a Frenchman of any one of the French types with which the Revolution has made us familiar: contrariwise, he was an elderly private gentleman from the county of Norfolk..He seemed by the slight bend at his knees and the leaning forward of his head to have no very great care how much further he might go..And my book should have a whole chapter devoted to Ulysses.		
She had her hair bunched up like an onion, a fashion which, as we all know, appealed to the Dutch in the seventeenth century, or at any rate to the plebeian Dutch..All that by which we painfully may earn rectitude and a proper balance in the conduct of our short affairs I must believe that you will practise; and I must believe, as I look here into your face, seeing your confident advance (as though you were flying out from your babyhood into young life without any fear), that the virtues which now surround you in a crowd and make a sort of court for you and are your angels every way, will go along with you and will stand by you to the end..Nothing is easier than to ridicule or deny so mystical a thing.		
Nor is it a rigid law among them that the sons of priests should be priests, but only the customso far, at least, as I have been able to discover..Are you in favour of removing the present disabilities of Monkeys?.There was the Ironmonger of BarleDuc; and there are hundreds of thousands of the same kind.		
The French but barely escaped a similarly permanent dissolution of national character: but they did escape it; and the national mark, the power of spontaneous and collective action, after a few years' check, began to emerge..Another time it happened to me between Goodwood and Upwaltham in Sussex.".Just as they were blazing away Dillon, who was far off but his superior, sent word to the batteries to cease firing.		
The mention of unpaid posts recalls the damning truth that all honorary positions in the Diplomatic Service, including even the purely formal stage in the Foreign Office, are closed to the Monkey; the very Court sinecures, which admittedly require no talents, are denied to our Simian fellowcreatures, if not by law at least by custom and in practice..But we cannot regard an agricultural future as promising for the new territory..And also what no book has ever yet given, an exact direction of the way in which one may roll into Orford Haven, on the top of a spring tide if one has luck, and how if one has no luck one sticks on the gravel and is pounded to pieces.		
Then there was a silence for a space of at least three minutes..At the next village I had come across the arteries of the movement..One could never be certain where one would find the guns.		
It is very vigorous today..There was an omnibus going down the King's Road which had 'To the World's End' painted on it..It is not on an island, as some have pretended, still less is it under the eartha ridiculous story, for there it is all dark."		
He sighed again..Who determined to recover from the defeats and to play once more that determined game which makes up half French history, the "Thesaurization," the gradual reaccumulation of power?.And, seventeenthly...." But King Philip banged the door.		
In this way even those who have failed to effect reform in their characters during their first term of imprisonment are commonlyif they are poorreincarcerated within a short time, so that the system works precisely as it was intended to, giving the maximum amount of reformation to the worst and the hardest characters..And when you are walking towards them from a long way off you do not seem to be marching towards anything great, but rather towards something clever..The bridge still remains the thing which may go at any moment and yet the thing which, when it remains, remains our oldest monument.		
We put them all to death, and our men cut off most of their heads and fixed them on their bayonets.'".Men famous in no way for their style, nor even for their learning, have maintained life by inscribing within its narrow boundaries the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments, while others have used it as a comparison in the classes of astronomy to illustrate the angle subtended by certain of the orbs of heaven..You're punctual I hope, Chrm?"		
Modern science has sufficiently dealt with them; and if any one bring out against the Monkey the obscurantist insult that His Hide is Covered with Hair, we can at once point to innumerable human beings, fully recognized and endowed with civic rights, who, were they carefully examined, would prove in no better case..You may if you will make a little picture of this to yourselves..He begrimed it and he rubbed at it, and then he tickled it up again with a knife, and then he smoked it, and then he put in some dirty whites which were vivid, and he played the fool with white of egg, and so forth, until he had the very tone and manner of the original; and as he had done it on an old bit of wood it was exactly right, and he was very proud of the result.		
One should end by asking one's self, "Will these unfinished movements breed a finished movement at last?.He invited me to enter, and begged me to purchase a seat..The difficulty of those Eastern moors and hills, for instance, the resistance they offer to human passage, meets you continually throughout English history.		
"Yes, certainly," said George confidently.."I did not say so," said the child, "I only asked.".But no history of him was given to me, nor do I now know as I write what occasion it was that made this head so great.		
It was not upon any musty theological whimsy that I wrote; the definition of stealing or "theft"I care not by what name you call itis not for practical men to discuss..As it covered this open space the line edged forward and upward.."At last by the steepness of a new descent I recognized that I had crossed the watershed and was coming down into the valley of this river.		
"Arbiter of Hellas," said Aristotle gravely, when the King had finished his tirade, "the thruppenny bit has not only all that character of usefulness which I have argued in it from the end it is designed to serve, but one may also perceive this virtue in it in another way, which is by observation..Their method of appointment is this: it is discovered as accurately as may be by a man's manner of dress and the hours of his labour and the size of the house he inhabits, whether he have more than a certain yearly revenue; any man discovered to have more than this revenue is immediately appointed to the office of which I speak..Monsieur, who was quite ignorant of such things, bought a couple, and there is a whole row of them in the little pavilion at Louveciennes.		
Time passed, and the young man Caedwalla, still a very young man in the twenties, came to his own, and he sat on the throne that was rightfully his in Chichester and he ruled all Sussex to its utmost boundaries..as you know, but not on such important business, Chrm!"."I come here every year.		
He introduced me to his wife, a hardfeatured woman, with thin hair, full of duty, busy and precisefresh from the kitchen..The guns were right up beyond the line, firing away..This was the man who came up to me as I was drawing my picture.		
It was the glory of the Middle Ages, it was a great vital institution of Christendom, sprung from the monastic institution that preceded it, a true and living power first in Spain, where Christendom was at its most acute activity in the struggle against Asia, then in the northwest, in England and in France..The place where a bridge is most needed, and is not present, is the Ford of Fornovo..For you must know that one day I came into Narbonne where I had never been before, and I saw written up in large letters upon a big, ugly house: ULYSSES, Lodging for Man and Beast.		
They were so small and light and delicate!."Go on," said King Philip, with some irritation; "go on; go on!".Your Honour's three Commissioners, Joshua Hogg, Abraham Bush and Jack Bimber, being of sound mind, solvent, and in good corporeal health, all citizens of more than five years' standing, and domiciled within the boundaries, frontiers or terms of the Republic, do make oath and say, So Help Them God: [Sidenote: Arrival off Atlantis.]		
Let me tell you that one always knows when one has been in Fairyland by the feeling afterwards, and because it is impossible to find it again.".Not to have understood that strength, nay, not to have appreciated the existence of the force of which I speak, has made nearly all the English histories of France worthless..It was now quite dark.		
So did I first see the Snowdon range when I was a little boy, having, until I woke up that morning and looked out of the windows of the hotel, never seen anything in my life more uplifted than the rounded green hills of South England..I never heard of him!.But this church has a right to the name.		
ON BRIDGES Stand on the side of a stream and consider two things: the imbecility of your private nature and the genius of your common kind..Moreover a harbour might be built as in our Recommendations (q.v.)..Then the inn at La Bruyère in the Landes, then the "Swan" at Petworth with its mild ale, then the "White Hart" of Storrington, then the rest of them, all the six or seven hundred of them, from the "Elephant" of Chateau Thierry to the "Feathers" of Ludlowa truly noble remainder of what once was England; the "Feathers" of Ludlow, where the beds are of honest wood with curtains to them, and where a man may drink half the night with the citizens to the success of their engines and the putting out of all fires.		
I never said that it was wrong or even foolish to alienate such a man..He lent me night clothes, though it was broad day, because he said that if I undressed and got into the bed I should be much more rested; they would keep everything quiet at that end of the house, and the gentle fall of the water into the moat outside would not disturb me..We then talked to each other, agreeing upon the maxims of simplicity and directness which are at the root of all mercantile stability.		
But such divorces as take place are very rightly treated differently, according to the wealth of the persons involved..That is one parable.."Have you considered their lines and their drawings and their cunning plans?"		
Every sentence betrays the personality: the keen, eccentric character which took to balloons just after the Montgolfiers, and fell with his balloon into the North Sea, wrote his Treatise on the use of such instruments in War, and was never happy unless he was seeing or doing somethingpreferably under arms..[Illustration: DIAGRAM IV..Supposing the Russian losses to be no greater than the Western Allies (they probably are somewhat greater, from the conditions of the fighting), or call them 30 per cent.		
In Germany you can do nothing of the kind..He has belt, pouches, pack covering to match..The actual wording of news is often chosen in order to deceive, although the figures may be accurate.		
So it is worth while if one is attempting to form a sound opinion upon the present campaign to see exactly how and why numbers are the deciding factor in war..It is essential to Prussia that no really independent Poland should rearise, even mutilated..Supposing you have, for instance, under such conditions as those of Diagram I, a line of trenches AB holding the issue between two obstacles X and Y against an enemy who attacks from the direction E. The number of men holding these trenches, AB, is nine units, and this number is just enough, and only just enough, to prevent an enemy attacking from E getting through.		
And, luckily for us, that wastage has been particularly heavy in the matter of officers..To keep such a web untangled, duly stretched, and accurately working is an effort of organization such as will never be seen in civilian life, and such as was never seen, even in military life, until modern times..False news, too readily credited, does not leave people merely insufficiently informed, conscious of their ignorance, and merely grumbling because they cannot learn more, it has the positive effect of putting them into the wrong frame of mind, of making them support what they should not support, and neglect what they should not neglect.		
And in time of war the whole nation begins at once to use instruments right and left for military purposes, which instruments had been originally designed for civilian purposes..The list of questions, detailed and general, which have already been wholly or partly answered by the present campaigns might be indefinitely extended..Why must the Censor act thus?		
But when large, and at the same time mobile howitzers were constructed which, though they fired shells of a quarter of a ton and more, could go along almost over any ground and be fired from almost anywhere, and moved at comparatively short notice from one place to another, it was another matter..Without it or against it in time of war you cannot govern..But at the opening of the war, say by the middle of September, when she had perhaps at the most twoandahalf million men in Poland, the total forces of the enemy, that is the total number of men Austria and Germany had equipped, trained, and ready for the field since the beginning of the war, was at least eight million.		
Paris has been almost bereft of them..Remember that these official German falsehoods, countersigned by the General Staff and the Government, are as rare as they are solid..So much for an illustration of what is meant by absolute numbers and of their importance in the present phase of the campaign.		
Holland   12..Let us begin with the differences..[Illustration: DIAGRAM X.		
Thus the German 11.2inch howitzer, of which we have heard so much in this war, has a maximum range when it is elevated to 43 degrees, or very nearly halfway between pointing flat and pointing straight upand howitzers can be fired, of course, at a much higher angle than that if necessary..I have before me as I write extract after extract of that sort..France: with AlsaceLorraine.		
The various Governments issuing the communiqués have acquired certain habits in them which are worth noting if one is attempting to get at an accurate view of the war, and these habits may be briefly described as follows: The British Government publishes short notes of advances made or of positions maintained, but very rarely refers to the losing of ground..2..An independent Catholic Southern Slav or Croat State, probably a holding of Vienna.		
[Illustration: MAP III..With the northern Slavs we count the Bohemians or Czechs, the Poles, and the Russiansusing the latter term, of course, for many distinct but connected groups, for it is certain that Russia proper must remain a unity..There is one other point which I have already alluded to briefly, in which German communiqués may mislead, and that is in the way they handle statistics.		
The Allied forces had advantagesthe English in personal equipment, medical and commissariat service; the French, Russians, and Serbians, in the type of field gun..of their total population, the Russians 1 per cent., the Germans perhaps 5 per cent., the Austrians between 3 and 4 per cent., the Serbians quite 10 per cent.and 10 per cent..This seemed obvious, but the critics of the second system of close or swarm formation always said that, though they admitted its enormous power if it could be used at all, it could not be used because its losses would be so enormous against modern firearms.		
It is advisable not only to discover such novelties, but also the permanent features, which even modern machinery and modern numbers have not changed..The six remaining sections would have to group themselves as above, and in either case there would be a bad gap..A modern quickfiring piece, firing moderately, will get rid of a ten pound note in ammunition in a minute.		
The Ring” Fortress (18601914)a series of detached forts lying three or four miles outside the inner place of stores, barracks, etc., which it was desired to defend.].It will be seen that, from this rough calculation, the wastage of the enemy has been so much greater than our own that, if it were absolute, his preponderance in numbers would have ceased, and the figures would stand nearly equal..We may take it that the object is nearly always domestic and political.		
Ultimately, all Europeans have much the same potential moral..They could direct all their trade at will towards Antwerp to the starvation of Rotterdam..Roumania   16.		
It needs adaptation, it is used far more roughly, has a shorter life, and is being therefore more expensively consumed..Today the 11inch howitzer, with a range of about six miles, capable of hiding behind any elevation and not to be discovered by any gun within the fortress, and, further, capable of being moved at a moment’s notice if it is discovered, has the fortress at its mercy..I mean by the effect of absolute numbers the fact that a certain minimum is required for any particular operation.		
The first of these is so much the more obvious in the public eye that it is often alone considered..Lastly, there is the indeterminate but heavy medical expense..The whole process may be compared to the perpetual running of millions of double threads, which reach from every soldier back ultimately to the central depots of the army, and thence to the manufactories, and these double threads perpetually working back and forth from the manufactories to the Front.		
And these chief points with regard to supply may be put briefly in three groups..She would keep AlsaceLorraine; she would keep in subjection the Poles who are already in subjection to her; she would leave the AustroHungarian Monarchy under the Hapsburgs with all its present possessions, whether those possessions grossly interfered with national realities or no..For instance, in this example of the supposed investment of Cracow.		
These earthworks were starshaped, sending out a number of projecting angles, so that an attack launched upon any point would receive converging fire from two points of the star, and the entrances were further protected by outer works called horn works..Racially, the Roumanians are probably Slavs for the most part, but their tongue is a Latin tongue; they are proud of Latin descent, and they are just as much a wedge between the Slavs of the north and south as the Magyars themselves..But if we consider only the principal ones we shall find that they fall roughly into two main categories.		
If you want to make your shell fall into a trench of a fortification or come down exactly on the top of the shelter in a fort, as at A, the trench in the fifth diagram, or at B, the shelter, it is obvious that your howitzer firing from H, and lobbing a projectile along the highangle trajectory M, will have a much better chance of hitting it than your gun G, sending a projectile further, indeed, but along the flatter trajectory N. Of course, another howitzer within the fortifications could, in theory, lob a shell of its own over the hill and hit the besieging howitzer, but in practice it is very easy for the besieging howitzer to find out exactly where the vulnerable points of the fortress areits trenches and its shelter and magazineand very difficult for the people in the fortress to find out where the howitzer outside is..If the extreme point at which you can stop a rush is the line LL then you must have at least enough menaaato cover that line with their fire.].When you are dealing with many miles of men whose armament is not only destructive at a great distance, but also over a wide belt of ground, you have, in the first place, a vast extension of any possible defensive lines.		
(2) Now what of Proportionate numbers?.It is always absolutely wise to prevent the enemy in time of war from learning things which would be an aid to him..The castles went down like ninepins.		
They are wise to do   this because there is no need to tell the enemy more than   he may know of his own success..Every time one of them fires a shot it fires away fifteen shillings..The remarkable general accuracy of the official German communiqués cannot be due to any other object.		
B represents the French and the first British contingent; C what the Russians could do..NUMBERS IN WAR In which it is explained why, other things being equal, numbers are always the deciding element in warfare, and how the enemy had a superiority throughout the autumn and winter (written late in the winter of 19141915). NUMBERS IN WAR The general reader hears continually in these times that numbers are the decisive element in war..The Wall of China is one great instance of them; the Roman Wall over the North of Britain, from sea to sea, is another; and the longfortified Roman frontier from the Rhine to the Danube was a third.		
That, for instance, was the object of a castle in the Middle Ages..But it was certain that she could not equip more than a certain number in a given time, or train them, or officer them, or govern them..Here is one fairly graphic way of showing what this scale of supply means.		
[Illustration: DIAGRAM V. If you want to make your shell fall into a trench of a fortification, A, or come down exactly on the top of the shelter in a fort, B, it is obvious that your howitzer, firing from H, and lobbing a projectile along the highangle trajectory M, will have a much better chance of hitting it than your gun G, sending a projectile further indeed but along the flatter trajectory N.] The advantage of the howitzer is twofold..It is evident that a mile of trench, for instance, could not be held by halfadozen men, even if the forces opposed to them were only a halfdozen..Thus it would be no shortening of the German line to fall back upon the Rhine.		
Secondly, the howitzer can drop its shell into a comparatively narrow trench, which the projectile of a gun with its flat trajectory will probably miss..You must be able, as you retreat, to check your enemy appreciably before you can trace such a line; you must be able to hammer him badly with heavy guns stronger than his own while you are making it, and unless you are present in very great numbers you will only be able to draw it over a comparatively short line which your enemy may be able to turn by the left or the right..The position of Holland after a German settlement might not uncertainly be compared to the position of Hamburg in the old days, on a larger scale, a free State just as Hamburg was a free city.		
The French had in the field at the outset of the war 5 per cent..Its main principles are simple enough..She would leave it as independent in its own eyes as it was before; she might insist upon an alliance with the Dutch army, she would certainly insist upon commercial terms, and probably rights of using certain ports in certain cases for war.		
And, what is more grave, opinion is sometimes led to misjudge altogether the nature of war by these novelties..It is, however, minutely accurate and even detailed in helping us to locate the fluctuations of the front, and by the aid of the French communiqués we can follow the war upon the map better than by the aid of any other..The public critique of the war is filled with estimates of enemy and allied numbers, numbers of reserve, numbers of killed, numbers of prisoners.
