they	had	sat	by	him	a	long	time	the	boy	and	the	dog	helpless	and	exhausted	both	of	them	hugh	was	quick	enough	to	reach	her	halfway	down	the	slope	but	totally	unable	to	check	her	course	it	was	just	a	year	ago	we	quarreled	he	said		
the	prints	were	very	large	and	clear	in	the	wet	earth	but	he	scarcely	noticed	them	so	far	gone	was	he	in	weariness	and	despair	i	could	see	the	light	from	your	cabin	but	well	i	had	promised	when	the	first	edge	of	his	starvation	was	dulled	when	the	warmth	of	the	fire	had	dried	and	warmed	him	so	that	he	ceased	to	shiver	he	stopped	eating	went	to	the	door	and	whined	to	be	gone		
he	blinked	up	at	the	clock	it	was	midnight	now	but	she	had	never	seen	the	little	log	cottage	so	she	could	not	have	been	responsible	for	the	spotless	cleanliness	of	everything	before	i	tell	you	about	it	you	must	have	your	sleep	the	hands	of	the	big	swedish	clock	in	the	corner	of	oscar	’s	kitchen	must	have	come	very	near	to	making	a	complete	round	before	hugh	awoke		
he	looked	down	again	at	his	hand	and	hugh	noticed	that	over	the	back	of	it	ran	a	long	puckered	scar	that	extended	upward	under	his	sleeve	he	ran	through	the	list	over	and	over	and	found	that	his	mind	with	odd	insistence	kept	coming	back	to	the	road	that	now	went	nowhere	but	some	day	would	go	far	the	announcement	that	supper	was	ready	interrupted	his	reflections	after	which	he	received	a	pressing	invitation	from	carl	to	go	with	him	to	get	the	mail	hugh	as	he	moved	sulkily	toward	the	shed	began	composing	bitter	speeches	to	be	launched	at	oscar	when	he	should	return		
i	vow	i	have	been	walking	in	a	circle	for	five	miles	it	was	only	nicholas	who	ever	got	me	here	again	all	night	the	wind	screamed	in	the	chimney	and	fairly	rocked	the	walls	of	their	little	dwelling	both	boys	held	their	breath	while	the	canoe	floated	with	the	current	slowly	slowly	it	crawled	into	the	thick	pool	of	shade	cast	by	a	big	maple	that	overhung	the	bank	early	next	morning	they	arose	to	search	the	ruins	of	the	storehouse	for	anything	that	might	have	escaped	destruction		
that	we	have	n’t	one	thing	left	to	eat	i	know	it	replied	hugh	soberly	they	dined	like	lords	that	day	but	spent	most	of	the	time	still	hugging	the	fire	for	the	cold	was	as	fierce	as	had	been	the	storm	that	went	before	it	could	john	be	taken	overland	paddled	up	rivers	carried	around	portages	risk	a	meeting	in	the	forest	with	halfbreed	jake	or	some	of	his	followers		
they	drove	off	hulda	just	for	a	blind	how	strange	it	was	that	after	leading	up	to	the	subject	so	long	jethro	should	have	dropped	it	so	quickly	the	snow	was	drifted	over	the	window	sills	and	banked	against	the	door	and	still	filled	the	air	in	white	clouds	driven	by	the	roaring	wind		
it	was	before	i	had	been	here	very	long	and	jake	and	his	friends	were	bound	to	run	me	out	jethro	brown	sent	me	to	you	and	gave	me	this	letter	began	hugh	but	he	received	no	answer	only	the	same	stolid	stare	i	wish	you	luck	he	said	it	will	be	a	long	task	finding	and	saving	two	men	who	either	have	fled	the	country	or	are	already	dead	linda	turned	back	to	speak	her	last	word	as	she	and	hugh	and	carl	went	out	together	into	the	dark		
with	a	great	sigh	of	relief	hugh	stepped	ashore	shouldered	his	pack	and	went	slowly	up	through	the	dawn	to	his	first	meeting	with	oscar	dansk	he	is	not	there	where	is	he	out	in	the	woods	looking	for	you	dick	shook	his	head	slowly	it	was	a	forlorn	hope	at	the	best	for	which	he	was	risking	everything	leaving	in	hugh	’s	safekeeping	property	that	was	infinitely	valuable	in	the	light	of	the	purpose	it	was	to	serve		
he	found	traces	here	and	there	of	where	he	had	passed	before	yet	the	way	was	so	twisted	and	uncertain	that	after	an	hour	of	struggling	through	the	underbrush	he	finally	came	out	on	the	same	ridge	again	and	faced	the	same	mass	of	red	rock	oh	dear	it	is	such	a	puzzle	i	wish	you	could	he	began	to	remember	now	that	jethro	had	dropped	some	hint	of	a	misunderstanding	between	john	edmonds	and	oscar	dansk	the	air	was	cold	so	that	he	turned	up	his	coatcollar	and	walked	very	briskly		
he	yawned	a	great	yawn	and	was	just	about	to	turn	from	the	window	when	a	moving	shadow	caught	his	eye	it	would	be	such	company	for	you	the	grimness	of	oscar	’s	tone	as	he	answered	startled	hugh	into	turning	square	about	i	will	be	back	before	a	great	many	hours		
hugh	did	not	stop	to	rekindle	the	lantern	but	flung	more	wood	upon	the	fire	and	by	its	light	went	about	the	task	of	getting	his	patient	partly	undressed	and	of	making	him	more	comfortable	he	began	to	wonder	if	there	were	not	some	easier	way	of	performing	the	task	and	presently	decided	that	there	was	he	wished	to	assure	himself	as	quickly	as	possible	that	all	his	calculations	were	correct		
the	moon	was	very	bright	now	so	that	all	the	little	square	houses	showed	plainly	as	did	the	white	expanse	of	the	empty	street	it	was	fortunate	that	it	was	so	dark	hugh	thought	for	it	seemed	as	though	they	were	about	to	pass	uncomfortably	close	to	the	pirate	’s	cabin	he	pushed	aside	the	curtain	rubbed	a	clear	space	in	the	thick	frost	on	the	pane	and	looked	out		
just	as	the	first	indian	’s	foot	was	upon	it	the	great	log	fell	splashing	into	the	water	was	whirled	over	and	over	by	the	current	and	rushed	away	down	stream	he	had	sat	down	upon	the	doorstep	also	where	he	could	see	on	one	side	the	open	sunlit	valley	and	on	the	other	the	narrow	ravine	with	its	little	stream	that	ran	between	them	and	jasper	peak	with	a	great	sigh	he	turned	at	last	fumbled	for	the	latch	of	the	door	and	stepped	inside		
john	edmonds	still	unconscious	was	lifted	to	the	rude	litter	they	had	constructed	and	was	carried	out	of	the	cabin	how	they	toiled	now	getting	a	little	the	better	of	the	fire	now	driven	back	by	a	fresh	outburst	of	flame	too	excited	either	to	hope	or	to	despair	feeling	only	one	instinct	to	fight	i	carried	johnny	on	my	back	he	said	do	n’t	ask	me	how	but	some	way	or	other	we	made	it		
one	look	at	his	white	anxious	face	when	he	came	home	long	after	dark	one	glimpse	of	his	smile	of	delight	and	relief	when	he	found	that	hugh	had	returned	safely	after	all	these	caused	the	boy	enough	remorse	without	the	wasting	of	any	words	i	will	have	to	look	it	out	no	hurry	returned	the	man	with	an	insolent	laugh	at	the	quavering	of	her	voice	do	n’t	disturb	yourself	so	much	it	was	probably	all	stolen	in	the	first	place	as	he	was	putting	one	of	the	bags	back	into	place	he	knocked	down	a	gun	that	had	been	standing	in	the	corner	and	that	now	fell	at	his	feet	with	a	loud	clatter		
he	does	every	kind	was	her	brief	reply	he	told	me	oh	quite	a	lot	of	things	do	you	mean	halfbreed	jake	inquired	hugh	anxiously		
whose	did	you	say	it	was	hugh	thought	afterwards	that	never	as	long	as	he	lived	would	he	forget	how	terrible	were	those	shifty	paleblue	eyes	in	that	lowering	face	and	you	know	that	there	is	nothing	that	can	make	you	so	angry	as	to	find	some	one	you	can	not	terrify	he	muttered	something	but	did	not	speak	aloud	at	last	he	reached	the	summit	but	found	that	the	trees	were	so	tall	and	thick	that	he	could	see	no	distance	even	from	there	and	a	slight	a	very	slight	doubt	began	to	arise	in	his	mind	as	to	whether	he	had	done	the	wisest	thing	in	following	a	plan	of	his	own		
it	was	a	tumbledown	log	building	with	a	few	rude	outhouses	and	ragged	fences	everything	was	kept	in	the	small	shed	backing	up	against	the	cottage	with	its	door	opening	into	the	main	room	it	required	almost	unbelievable	effort	to	arouse	john	edmonds	and	move	him	helplessly	weak	as	he	was	to	the	improvised	couch		
hugh	had	to	stand	and	look	for	some	minutes	before	he	could	distinguish	the	narrow	trail	threading	its	way	off	among	the	trees	the	path	that	he	must	now	follow	then	at	last	warmed	to	friendliness	perhaps	by	hugh	’s	calm	acceptance	of	the	dangers	of	the	rapids	the	indian	behind	him	spoke	some	millionaire	or	other	owns	what	there	are	and	those	swedes	who	spent	everything	they	had	to	buy	themselves	a	hole	in	the	ground	they	work	for	him	and	live	as	best	they	can	why	did	n’t	they	all	go	back	to	sweden	again	hugh	inquired		
hugh	covered	it	in	extraordinarily	short	time	although	it	seemed	to	him	unnumbered	hours	he	kept	thinking	that	they	must	vanish	from	his	sight	even	as	he	held	them	and	wished	earnestly	that	dick	were	not	asleep	that	he	might	ask	him	whether	he	saw	them	too	i	wish	to	answered	hugh	without	looking	around		
so	they	doubted	and	hesitated	and	finally	lost	heart	he	was	about	to	ask	what	it	was	when	the	indian	spoke	at	last	a	single	inarticulate	word	which	was	evidently	meant	as	a	warning	he	did	not	agree	just	then	that	it	was	the	best	but	on	looking	back	afterward	he	wondered	at	his	own	stupidity		
i	was	just	coming	up	from	the	spring	dick	recounted	as	between	them	they	led	the	cow	homeward	when	i	heard	nicholas	bark	so	i	ran	around	the	corner	of	the	cabin	and	there	she	was	just	going	over	the	hill	a	quarter	of	a	mile	away	it	was	the	boy	shokatan	carrying	hugh	’s	pack	which	he	had	left	beside	the	fire	he	went	out	to	feed	hulda	slamming	the	door	smartly	behind	him	and	never	looking	at	oscar	who	was	still	in	sight	trudging	along	the	open	ridge	above	the	valley		
when	they	set	out	again	next	day	oscar	gave	his	directions	without	any	added	warning	that	this	time	hugh	had	better	not	improve	upon	them	with	additions	of	his	own	five	hundred	dollars	i	would	’a’	got	for	them	just	that	little	bale	not	a	cent	less	and	when	i	come	to	myself	again	every	hide	and	hair	of	them	was	gone	and	you	ca	n’t	tell	who	took	them	questioned	one	of	his	audience	you	see	it	was	jake	who	had	commenced	to	make	trouble		
the	sight	of	food	when	one	is	nearly	starved	has	sometimes	a	strange	and	disquieting	effect	the	mild	hulda	now	thoroughly	alarmed	came	down	the	hill	with	a	blind	rush	blundered	against	him	and	rolled	him	head	over	heels	that	makes	all	the	difference	in	the	world	why	i	do	n’t	know	stammered	hugh	just	footprints	of	some	big	animal		
we	can	get	pretty	hungry	though	observed	hugh	grimly	as	he	saw	nicholas	disposing	of	his	share	in	three	laps	and	then	looking	up	to	beg	mutely	for	more	i	will	go	back	just	the	way	i	came	was	his	first	plan	but	it	proved	impossible	to	follow	he	looked	at	the	wide	valley	brimming	with	sunshine	and	abundant	fertility	and	thought	of	what	a	gift	it	might	offer	to	faminestricken	france	as	she	cried	to	america	for	aid		
nicholas	ran	to	him	and	began	licking	the	thin	hand	that	hung	limply	over	the	arm	of	the	chair	nicholas	would	not	trust	their	way	of	crossing	but	swam	over	with	much	difficulty	and	was	waiting	for	them	on	the	other	shore	a	lot	of	good	i	did	by	going	the	thing	now	said	hugh	is	to	get	your	brother	away	as	quickly	as	we	can		
after	rubbing	the	drowsiness	from	his	eyes	and	thinking	a	little	he	decided	that	even	under	his	mountain	of	blankets	he	was	very	cold	i	staked	out	a	claim	for	a	farm	of	my	own	and	i	mean	to	live	here	until	it	is	mine	and	those	people	in	rudolm	see	that	it	can	be	done	and	that	jake	’s	threats	must	come	to	nothing	in	the	end	but	of	one	thing	he	did	not	speak	of	the	interruption	in	the	work	of	the	threatened	strike	and	the	disappearance	of	the	company	’s	funds		
wo	n’t	you	wait	a	few	days	until	i	can	go	or	roddy	can	ride	over	for	us	beatrice	impatient	and	disappointed	sat	silent	in	her	saddle	thinking	deeply	beatrice	had	sprained	her	knee	in	that	perilous	moment	when	she	dropped	the	ax	over	the	mountainside	but	she	had	scarcely	noticed	the	mishap	until	slipping	from	the	saddle	at	her	own	door	she	found	herself	unable	to	walk	into	the	house	nancy	had	put	out	the	light	and	was	putting	up	the	curtains	when	she	aroused	her	drowsy	sister	with	a	sudden	cry	o	beatrice	come	here	and	look	they	stood	together	at	the	open	window	startled	and	terrified	by	what	they	saw		
dabney	’s	mouth	opened	to	speak	but	no	words	came	only	at	last	a	long	whistle	of	astonishment	he	stopped	where	john	herrick	’s	nervous	black	pony	was	tied	peered	over	the	fence	and	poised	his	pencil	once	more	above	a	page	it	will	be	a	good	thing	to	have	a	horse	on	the	place	toward	noon	the	two	girls	with	christina	’s	assistance	began	to	bring	some	order	out	of	the	confusion		
it	seemed	at	first	that	she	had	found	her	brother	only	in	time	to	part	with	him	again	for	through	four	terrible	days	he	lay	so	ill	that	not	even	dr.	minturn	could	have	much	hope	why	should	n’t	she	be	nursing	him	when	she	is	his	own	sister	she	cried	hotly	a	sudden	burst	of	temper	driving	her	quite	beyond	the	bounds	of	prudence	chapter	xii	                            	dead	man	’s	mile	it	was	comfort	rather	than	advice	that	a	very	weary	and	dispirited	beatrice	needed	when	at	last	she	arrived	at	dr.	minturn	’s	house		
the	words	i	meant	to	say	were	never	spoken	i	do	believe	it	’s	a	bear	his	tone	was	one	of	undisguised	dismay	it	is	the	only	one	i	know	of		
it	had	been	the	last	one	she	had	attended	before	the	doctor	’s	verdict	concerning	aunt	anna	’s	health	which	had	upset	all	their	plans	and	driven	them	west	long	before	the	hour	was	over	she	was	beginning	to	feel	quite	rested	and	herself	again	and	when	her	hostess	came	to	announce	that	supper	was	ready	she	was	sitting	at	the	window	gazing	out	at	the	sunset	light	on	the	white	peaks	of	the	range	opposite	i	know	who	he	is	all	right	christina	’s	boy	that	went	off	to	sea	and	that	has	such	a	warm	welcome	waiting	for	him	in	ely		
did	he	come	from	the	village	she	asked	but	old	tim	answered	evasively	beatrice	however	sat	erect	and	wide	awake	he	seemed	quite	unoffended	and	not	convinced	even	yet	that	his	quest	was	fruitless		
the	heavy	table	and	straight	clumsy	chairs	must	also	have	been	brought	there	by	their	predecessors	and	the	bunks	in	the	two	little	rooms	under	the	roof	must	have	been	their	work	it	was	difficult	under	that	frowning	scrutiny	to	hand	the	two	letters	to	sam	the	more	so	since	christina	eyed	one	of	the	envelopes	with	such	nervous	apprehension	we	give	you	warning	olaf	was	saying	that	you	are	not	to	come	on	john	herrick	’s	place	again		
it	was	john	herrick	with	the	moonlight	on	his	fair	hair	and	flooding	the	ground	about	him	like	a	pool	of	still	water	up	and	up	and	there	suddenly	was	john	herrick	lying	on	a	narrow	shelf	of	rock	just	below	them	his	white	face	turned	upward	to	the	sky	and	the	stones	and	tufts	of	grass	about	him	stained	with	blood	he	brought	the	familiar	leathercovered	book	from	an	inside	pocket	and	held	it	out	to	its	owner		
she	thought	over	one	by	one	all	the	events	in	that	long	twisted	chain	of	circumstances	that	had	brought	her	here	and	realized	all	that	she	had	learned	how	much	she	had	changed	even	his	unquenched	cheerfulness	seemed	affected	by	instinctive	dread	of	thorvik	’s	sour	illtemper	miriam	would	have	a	garden	dr.	minturn	said	when	the	greetings	were	over	and	beatrice	had	admired	the	flowers		
can	you	forgive	me	the	girls	slipped	away	and	dr.	minturn	closed	the	door	she	had	knotted	the	bridle	reins	on	presto	’s	neck	turned	up	the	stirrups	over	the	saddle	given	him	a	slap	on	the	flank	and	told	him	to	go	home	every	welltrained	western	horse	knows	that	order	and	will	find	his	way	over	the	steepest	trails	back	to	his	own	stable	nor	will	he	allow	himself	to	be	stopped	or	molested	on	the	way	she	was	panting	and	exhausted	her	knees	shook	under	her	it	seemed	utterly	impossible	to	go	farther		
bless	you	he	’s	that	wise	he	can	almost	take	care	of	himself	sam	reassured	her	she	and	you	might	be	in	too	much	of	a	hurry	and	ruin	everything	even	a	duller	eye	than	thorvik	’s	might	have	noted	that	the	letter	was	of	special	importance	to	her		
just	ahead	at	the	turn	of	the	trail	they	could	see	his	little	tent	his	various	belongings	heaped	together	and	the	aimless	drifting	smoke	of	his	still	smoldering	camp	fire	one	morning	when	she	was	astir	early	she	saw	him	meet	christina	on	the	path	below	the	house	and	watched	him	take	from	her	the	basket	in	which	she	was	bringing	their	marketing	and	it	was	proved	that	he	was	too	young		
a	strange	creature	who	called	himself	a	reporter	stopped	me	at	my	door	as	i	was	starting	for	the	village	a	bear	wo	n’t	bother	you	at	all	if	you	leave	him	alone	we	used	to	be	in	a	big	city	and	we	had	that	same	full	restless	life	that	most	city	dwellers	know		
i	do	n’t	understand	at	all	why	she	wants	to	stay	she	said	but	stay	she	shall	you	will	be	soaked	again	before	you	get	home	it	is	not	raining	so	much	now	olaf	observed	reaching	for	his	cap	that	lay	on	the	windowsill	it	will	soon—	he	interrupted	himself	suddenly	and	turned	round	to	them	with	a	delighted	grin	leaning	forward	she	attempted	to	look	down	into	the	valley	and	was	surprised	to	see	no	valley	there		
an	unusual	haze	seemed	to	hang	like	a	blanket	between	them	and	the	sun	and	the	air	held	a	strange	chill	roddy	said	you	were	to	have	it	it	is	lucky	we	had	presto	beatrice	said	to	her	sister		
the	shadow	of	unforgettable	pain	swept	over	his	face	and	the	laughter	died	in	his	eyes	i	surmised	it	was	something	like	that	he	observed	when	he	had	heard	her	to	the	end	and	i	have	been	thinking	about	it	ever	since	she	opened	the	door	and	started	back	with	a	cry	of	surprise		
she	was	beginning	already	to	catch	the	western	habit	of	dropping	the	title	mister	except	in	direct	address	my	mother	and	john	herrick	made	me	promise	that	i	would	not	go	to	the	village	while	things	were	so	upset	since	he	says	there	is	no	use	in	stirring	up	bad	feeling	again	he	got	up	and	walked	stiffly	to	the	door		
your	father	had	made	some	effort	to	procure	proof	against	him	but	there	was	nothing	definite	enough	to	exonerate	jack	before	the	world	i	want	you	to	sit	down	and	tell	me—	his	voice	faltered	but	in	a	moment	he	went	on	again	and	tell	me	about	anna	things	went	very	well	for	some	months		
dismounting	and	with	buck	’s	bridle	over	her	arm	she	turned	the	corner	of	the	wall	of	rock	to	find	her	picnic	ground	occupied	it	seemed	in	the	midst	of	excitement	and	the	anxiety	to	atone	that	waiting	was	the	one	intolerable	thing	looking	down	they	saw	that	john	herrick	had	opened	his	eyes	again	and	was	staring	up	at	them	without	moving		
beatrice	thought	so	as	she	came	into	the	kitchen	in	the	late	afternoon	and	found	them	both	making	preparations	to	depart	he	had	left	financial	matters	almost	entirely	to	the	contractor	who	so	he	had	considered	was	completely	honest	after	supper	accordingly	he	sat	on	the	grassy	bank	in	the	moonlight	with	a	girl	on	each	side	of	him	and	listened	gravely	to	all	that	beatrice	with	occasional	additions	from	nancy	had	to	say		
and	now	john	herrick	’s	chance	of	life	was	hanging	on	her	memory!.it	seemed	impossible	for	her	to	get	used	to	joe	ling	with	his	masklike	face	and	silent	oriental	manners	not	a	wheel	can	turn	until	the	money	is	found	nancy	looked	at	him	with	inquisitive	interest		
your	aunt	will	get	well	he	assured	them	the	strain	of	the	terrible	minutes	that	had	just	passed	broke	down	suddenly	into	uncontrollable	mirth	so	that	gale	after	gale	of	laughter	swept	over	them	both	she	called	her	sister	out	finally	and	introduced	the	newcomer	stiffly	and	motioned	nancy	to	sit	beside	her		
the	sullen	animosity	deepened	on	the	man	’s	face	she	saw	that	he	had	not	moved	but	was	sitting	his	horse	staring	after	her	at	some	length	he	told	of	the	difficulty	in	getting	the	irrigation	project	started	of	how	long	it	had	taken	to	form	a	company	and	to	get	construction	under	way		
when	you	talked	of	things	you	had	done	when	you	were	small	children	i	used	to	listen	hungrily	hoping	you	might	speak	of	him	but	you	never	did	there	are	still	men	in	the	village	telling	what	they	will	do	to	him	when	he	comes	back	what	was	it	he	did	beatrice	asked	he	inspected	his	patient	and	announced	a	very	great	improvement	and	then	said	he	must	go	on	at	once	since	he	hoped	to	visit	the	town	and	start	back	over	the	mountain	that	same	day		
she	cast	aside	dr.	minturn	’s	advice	to	let	john	herrick	make	the	first	move	toward	reconciliation	beatrice	and	hester	were	at	the	cabin	when	the	two	berry	pickers	returned	why	must	we	go	his	eyes	were	looking	beyond	her	at	the	threatening	sky	and	that	ominous	deeping	color	of	the	range	opposite		
when	the	time	comes	to	act	you	will	know	what	to	do	so	dr.	minturn	had	said	and	he	had	been	right	i	wonder	how	soon	help	can	come	john	herrick	lying	very	still	among	the	blankets	made	no	comment	the	heavy	dark	forest	seemed	to	cling	like	a	blanket	to	the	lower	slopes	of	the	mountains	as	though	it	had	slipped	away	from	the	smooth	rocky	shoulders	of	the	heights	above		
you	must	reach	dr.	minturn	’s	before	dark	and	i	have	none	too	much	daylight	left	to	climb	my	own	trail	helplessly	she	stood	watching	while	he	caught	the	horses	and	saddled	them	presently	she	got	up	to	steal	into	nancy	’s	room	opposite	and	see	how	she	was	faring	the	two	horses	were	lingering	near	the	fire	she	caught	their	bridles	and	waited		
suddenly	olaf	glanced	over	his	shoulder	and	then	turned	about	quickly	billy	as	he	ran	across	the	room	could	see	over	the	stranger	’s	shoulder	down	between	the	trees	to	the	creek	and	the	high	rocks	at	the	edge	of	the	little	harbour	the	thing	directly	before	her	was	always	the	one	thing	that	sally	saw	saw	it	clearly	and	fully	and	knew	just	what	she	was	going	to	do	about	it		
he	held	a	mortgage	on	the	land	once	and	though	it	was	paid	off	in	my	father	’s	time	i	’m	blessed	if	i	know	if	there	is	anything	to	show	for	the	payment	at	my	end	and	there	are	others	who	say	my	place	here	is	so	original	and	quaint’	and	they	must	have	a	corner	in	their	gardens	just	like	it	so	they	take	the	seeds	away	to	plant	them	somewhere	in	the	middle	west	where	the	ground	bakes	as	hard	as	iron	and	the	hot	air	dries	up	the	buds	before	they	can	open	if	this	was	the	way	one	learned	to	sail	a	boat	he	supposed	that	he	could	master	it	as	well	as	another		
the	days	went	by	the	poppies	drooped	their	heads	and	scattered	their	petals	in	the	winds	the	early	apples	turned	yellow	on	captain	saulsby	’s	trees	and	the	blackberries	ripened	along	the	wall	now	we	’ve	come	so	far	we	’ve	got	to	get	her	but	but	what	do	i	do	inquired	billy	quite	bewildered	at	the	task	set	him	chapter	viii	                        	the	stranger	at	the	mill	there	was	a	pause	as	sally	struggled	with	an	obstinate	latch	then	she	opened	the	door	at	the	head	of	the	stairs	and	disappeared		
the	silence	was	so	complete	that	billy	could	hear	the	blood	throbbing	in	his	ears	and	the	faint	squeak	of	a	board	under	sally	’s	foot	as	she	shifted	her	position	they’re	taking	boys	of	eighteen	sixteen	even	if	their	parents	say	yes	fellows	who	have	learned	about	as	much	of	ships	as	they	could	find	out	from	sailing	chips	in	a	duckpond	‘that	lighthouse	should	an	accident	happen	there	and	some	of	the	ships	go	on	the	rocks	it	will	be	so	many	less	against	the	fatherland.’	or	that	wireless	station	at	rockford	it	is	working	to	our	harm	help	to	destroy	it	for	the	fatherland.’	i	sunk	my	boat	that	they	might	no	longer	try	to	send	me	on	their	errands		
wait	they	did	through	the	length	of	a	hot	sultry	day	she	advanced	to	the	stairs	leaving	billy	in	the	dark	climbed	to	the	first	landing	and	turned	back	to	smile	at	him	the	time	of	billy	’s	visit	had	come	to	an	end	the	morning	of	his	departure	arrived	and	he	came	down	dressed	in	his	travelling	clothes	to	say	goodbye	to	his	dear	good	friend		
the	wind	was	blowing	fiercer	and	fiercer	and	the	spray	dashing	up	in	columns	between	the	rocks	the	harbour	he	speaks	of	is	at	the	northwest	end—	they	moved	out	of	hearing	and	billy	took	the	opportunity	to	stretch	his	cramped	knees	and	shift	his	uneasy	position	before	they	should	come	back	again	if	this	wind	could	seem	so	sharp	and	bracing	if	lake	michigan	could	roll	in	such	waves	upon	the	beach	what	would	it	be	to	feel	the	fresh	sea	breeze	and	to	hear	the	surf	come	thundering	in	on	the	shores	of	appledore		
he	was	heartily	ashamed	of	being	there	eavesdropping	but	well	one	does	not	get	into	the	war	game	often	that	will	give	her	a	chance	to	do	a	bit	of	real	sailing	the	plan	was	readily	agreed	to	by	all	concerned	apparently	with	the	most	heartiness	by	the	josephine	herself	he	tried	to	whistle	to	keep	up	the	spirits	of	both	of	them	but	the	tune	sounded	high	and	queer	and	cracked	and	he	gave	it	up		
the	old	sailor	himself	seemed	to	be	full	of	other	thoughts	for	when	he	spoke	again	it	was	as	much	to	himself	as	to	billy	they	set	out	together	down	the	lane	billy	feeling	much	cheered	now	that	he	had	some	notion	of	what	they	were	to	do	no	they	heard		
his	mind	had	dropped	away	entirely	into	the	past	he	talked	of	singapore	now	and	of	hot	still	nights	on	the	indian	ocean	or	of	the	restless	choppy	tossing	of	the	china	sea	he	laid	the	glasses	upon	a	ledge	of	rock	so	that	he	should	not	break	them	as	he	clambered	down	to	a	lower	level	so	america	was	to	be	guarded	so	her	allies	were	to	be	given	aid		
did	you	see	anything?.that	’s	a	dangerous	kind	of	man	billy	wentworth	the	most	risky	kind	a	community	can	have	he	observed	that	the	old	sailor	seemed	very	weary	that	more	than	once	his	hands	slipped	from	their	hold	and	had	to	take	a	fresh	grip		
he	forgot	captain	saulsby	completely	forgot	everything	except	that	he	must	run	to	help	sally	billy	had	a	sudden	feeling	that	it	would	be	pleasant	to	rejoin	captain	saulsby	and	his	aunt	as	soon	as	it	was	possible	all	of	a	sudden	as	i	stood	there	looking	i	saw	a	fullrigged	ship	dead	ahead	of	us	every	sail	spread	out	to	the	wind	her	bowwave	slanting	sharp	out	on	each	side	from	her	cutwater	her	wake	showing	clear	in	a	white	line	of	foam		
we	were	all	dogtired	and	could	have	slept	where	we	stood	but	the	wind	was	still	up	and	it	was	n’t	easy	going	yet	we	were	right	in	line	to	ram	her	amidships	it	seemed	we	could	n’t	miss	her	except	by	a	miracle	but	on	the	fourth	day	a	clear	cloudless	one	with	brisk	winds	and	a	sea	so	bright	that	it	fairly	hurt	your	eyes	to	look	at	it	he	went	down	to	see	his	friend	captain	saulsby	and	found	that	he	too	was	caught	by	the	fascination	of	this	same	war	game		
billy	still	clung	to	him	and	to	the	boat	while	his	arms	ached	then	pricked	and	burned	and	finally	became	numb	wet	footprints	showed	on	the	grey	stone	surface	as	though	somebody	had	but	now	walked	across	the	weedfringed	rocks	uncovered	by	the	half	tide	and	had	then	crossed	the	drier	space	above	the	sails	were	hoisted	the	rudder	adjusted	and	the	little	boat	breathlessly	lowered	off	the	edge	of	a	rock		
the	old	captain	had	revived	enough	to	insist	that	he	should	be	carried	nowhere	else	and	had	had	the	force	to	get	his	own	way	captain	saulsby	seemed	to	know	just	the	moment	when	it	was	light	enough	for	observation	for	he	pulled	the	glasses	from	his	pocket	adjusted	them	and	looked	long	and	earnestly	out	to	sea	he	went	up	the	steps	in	one	breathless	leap	and	came	inside	the	mill		
i	thought	your	clothes	looked	as	though	you	had	been	doing	something	dreadful	to	them	she	said	i	am	afraid	they	will	never	be	good	for	anything	again	billy	did	cut	rather	a	sorry	figure	for	he	had	been	wet	and	dried	and	wet	and	dried	again	before	his	long	nap	on	the	dusty	floor	i	know	all	of	that	kind	of	vessel	that	sails	in	these	waters	and	she	’s	a	new	one	to	me	he	adjusted	the	glass	again	and	looked	long	at	the	moving	speck	and	the	wreath	of	smoke	that	trailed	across	the	sea	we	finally	traced	him	down	to	the	point	here	but	when	we	looked	in	at	the	window	of	the	mill	and	heard	the	old	captain	swearing	and	shouting	and	saw	only	you	two	bending	over	him	we	did	n’t	think	our	friend	could	possibly	be	there		
the	boy	was	about	to	hurry	after	him	but	sally	put	her	hand	upon	his	arm	listen	the	monotonous	creak	of	rowlocks	was	plainly	to	be	heard	now	and	the	quiet	dip	and	splash	of	oars	as	they	rose	and	fell	this	was	still	the	burden	of	his	thoughts	when	the	boat	rounded	the	point	into	rockford	harbour	and	appledore	island	vanished	from	his	sight		
he	went	back	along	the	point	and	up	the	beach	path	thinking	deeply	it	would	be	more	interesting	to	relate	his	tale	to	them	than	to	aunt	mattie	although	she	was	proving	to	be	rather	a	good	sort	too	oh	stop	her	cried	billy	in	frantic	excitement		
i	drifted	here	and	drifted	there	lost	or	spent	my	money	the	day	after	i	got	to	port	and	had	to	ship	again	in	any	berth	i	could	certainly	the	little	boat	was	doing	her	best	to	be	worthy	of	her	sofamous	namesake	would	you	like	to	look	in	the	big	timbered	door	was	fastened	only	by	an	iron	latch	so	there	was	no	difficulty	about	pushing	it	open	and	peeping	in		
if	i	had	been	young	it	would	have	been	different	when	lads	are	n’t	used	to	standing	watch	such	a	thing	may	happen	and	we	know	they	’ll	learn	better	but	when	an	old	sailor	does	it	he	can	be	sure	of	just	one	thing	his	days	at	sea	are	near	their	end	a	camping	trip	among	those	wonderful	mountains	planned	by	himself	to	include	just	the	boys	he	wanted	there	must	have	been	a	draught	under	the	closed	door	at	the	top	for	it	made	her	candle	wink	and	flicker	but	she	marched	on	undismayed		
once	more	they	stood	off	on	the	new	course	the	tubby	little	craft	rising	and	dipping	bravely	billy	clinging	to	the	tiller	and	beginning	to	feel	suddenly	that	the	boat	was	a	live	thing	under	his	hand	ready	to	do	his	slightest	bidding	if	the	tide	were	half	an	hour	higher	i	would	risk	following	there	was	a	big	fireplace	of	rough	stones	a	bench	near	it	a	table	and	a	broken	chair	or	two	with	a	threelegged	stool	in	the	chimney	corner		
it	was	the	week	before	easter	the	season	of	that	april	session	of	congress	when	the	warbill	slowly	but	surely	made	its	way	through	senate	and	house	and	the	possibility	of	a	struggle	became	a	final	reality	he	’s	queerer	than	the	captain	or	johann	too	thought	billy	and	with	some	reason	she	looks	to	me	like	one	of	those	women	who	would	try	to	grow	poppies	in	a	pot	he	said	to	billy	after	she	had	gone		
he	had	been	hanging	to	that	boat	four	or	five	hours	and	that	does	n’t	tend	to	clear	the	brain	well	said	the	captain	i	’m	not	very	sure	myself	but	i	may	plan	to	look	into	the	matter	without	telling	him	so	my	folks	were	like	yours	though	you	would	n’t	think	it	they	were	people	with	booklearning	doctors	and	lawyers	and	the	like	a	friendly	bluejacket	who	had	also	come	to	ask	after	the	captain	’s	welfare	took	billy	under	his	care	and	offered	to	conduct	him	up	on	deck		
if	the	whole	united	states	navy	ca	n’t	catch	a	man	like	that	he	said	weakly	to	billy	i	guess	it	’s	ned	saulsby	’s	duty	to	keep	in	the	world	a	little	longer	and	try	to	be	a	match	for	the	rascal	the	doctor	said	that	the	old	sailor	’s	recovery	was	miraculously	quick	the	captain	himself	that	it	was	slower	than	a	wet	week	that	woman	he	would	say	indicating	the	longsuffering	nurse	that	woman	that	’s	all	rustles	and	starch	and	has	no	real	heart	she	keeps	me	down	when	the	only	thing	i	need	to	get	well	is	to	walk	out	along	the	garden	path	and	feel	the	good	warm	sunshine	on	my	back	a	day	came	however	when	that	woman	’s	reign	was	over	and	she	and	the	old	captain	bade	each	other	goodbye	that	he	thought	must	be	part	of	what	made	him	feel	so	queer	perhaps	she	had	less	imagination	than	other	children	and	so	was	not	apt	to	be	aroused	by	the	thought	of	dangerous	possibilities		
he	was	at	first	angry	to	find	he	had	no	hope	of	reaching	the	other	shore	then	his	anger	turned	quickly	to	a	single	thought	could	he	possibly	struggle	back	to	land	again?.for	nearly	three	years	the	war	had	waged	in	europe	a	war	far	too	big	to	realize	far	too	distant	to	be	very	disturbing	to	a	schoolboy	’s	daily	life	as	the	boat	puffed	out	of	the	harbour	he	leaned	back	in	the	deck	chair	content	at	last	since	he	knew	that	now	there	were	no	more	obstacles	between	him	and	his	journey	’s	end		
it	became	plain	to	the	boy	as	he	clung	determinedly	with	one	arm	around	the	old	man	and	one	flung	over	the	ridge	of	the	keel	that	the	boat	was	growing	heavier	and	more	waterlogged	with	every	wave	to	which	she	rose	that	their	one	support	was	slowly	settling	beneath	them	in	time	of	war	and	tumults	it	was	headed	and	reminded	him	of	what	for	a	little	time	he	had	forgotten	that	there	was	a	war	it	is	the	great	lakes	naval	station	where	they	train	the	sailors	for	the	warships		
the	rest	of	the	torpedoboat	flotilla	is	coming	in	too	said	the	sailor	at	his	side	chuckling	gleefully	poor	things	i	hate	to	think	of	them	off	somewhere	drooping	and	withering	for	a	whiff	of	fresh	salt	wind	captain	saulsby	said	billy	gravely	i	do	believe	you	care	a	lot	for	those	flowers	of	yours	by	the	time	billy	had	finished	eating	she	was	not	only	in	full	possession	of	his	story	but	had	put	on	her	coat	had	got	ready	a	large	bundle	and	a	basket	and	had	explained	as	much	of	the	situation	to	her	grandmother	as	spasmodic	shouting	could	accomplish		
i	do	n’t	think	there	is	much	fun	in	adventures	that	you	have	all	alone	was	the	grave	comment	that	he	made	to	himself	as	he	stumbled	up	the	beach	the	destroyer	crept	onward	feeling	her	way	altering	her	course	every	now	and	again	to	avoid	some	manofwar	swinging	at	anchor	ahead	of	her	he	certainly	has	had	enough	to	kill	any	three	ordinary	men	of	his	age	billy	heard	him	say	but	an	old	sailor	like	that	is	made	of	iron	and	rubber	and	rhinoceros	hide		
captain	saulsby	’s	rheumatism	seemed	completely	forgotten	as	he	set	off	along	the	shore	path	to	meet	the	boat	when	she	came	to	port	with	aunt	mattie	walking	beside	him	he	held	a	flag	in	each	hand	and	was	spelling	out	some	signalled	message	in	frantic	haste	i	have	wondered	a	good	deal	if	they	did	n’t	have	something	to	do	with	each	other	there	’s	germans	and	germans	the	old	man	answered
