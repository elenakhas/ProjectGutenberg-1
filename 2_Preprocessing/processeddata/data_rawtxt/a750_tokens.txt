sarah	that	young	man	knows	how	to	take	care	of	himself		
a	truculent	little	green	bird	no	bigger	than	a	robin	but	with	the	spirit	of	a	disgruntled	bayard		
but	his	guilelessness	served	to	carry	her	over	a	rather	shaky	bridge		
i	believe	for	the	present	i	'll	call	you	mathison		
you	made	everything	very	easy	for	us		
it	sounds	too	much	like	german	and	we	'll	be	held	up		
there	's	an	umbrella	in	the	corner	by	the	door		
on	the	lounge	in	his	compartmentwhich	was	still	no		
here	is	where	we	shall	trip	him	up		
i	ask	where	her	luggage	is	and	she	says	she	left	it	on	the	train		
just	surrendered	the	key	and	faded		
the	manager	did	more	than	that		
the	brain	about	the	size	of	your	fingertip	is	memory	in	the	concrete		
he	gathered	one	vague	impressionthat	she	was	young		
but	i	'll	put	the	bird	back	in	his	cage	if	you	do	n't	mind		
he	put	away	the	green	ribbon	and	rang	for	the	porter		
i	know	when	i	'm	beaten		
you	pawned	it	to	buy	a	new	dress	a	new	hat		
a	cold	berserker	rage	had	taken	possession	of	him	one	of	those	upheavals	of	hate	which	instead	of	blinding	clarify	the	fires	of	which	burn	steadily	until	the	end	is	attained		
write	as	many	as	you	like		
and	it	never	would	have	entered	his	head	but	for	the	startling	revelation	of	what	suggestion	might	accomplish		
he	might	be	watching	from	his	carwindow	when	we	arrive		
he	was	n't	at	all	happy		
of	course	you	understand	that	all	these	mysterious	actions	have	to	do	with	the	government	and	that	there	must	be	absolute	secrecy	on	the	part	of	the	management		
to	injure	me		
she	knew	that	he	was	strong	resourceful	courageous		
i	might	understand	something	of	this	if	i	was	full	of	hootch		
i	had	the	example	of	my	father		
got	two		
the	prisoner	his	hands	clasped	behind	his	head	seemed	particularly	interested	in	a	pattern	on	the	ceiling	but	in	reality	he	was	counting	the	thuds	of	the	secret	service	operative	's	chair	and	out	of	this	sound	developed	a	daring	campaign	for	liberty		
did	you	like	the	play		
who	knows		
what	do	you	think		
he	decided	to	draw	up	broadside		
jargon		
he	was	ready		
he	's	going	into	this	town	for	the	night		
but	it	tears	and	rends		
as	hilda	nordstromthe	farringtonhe	had	known	her	less	than	three	hours		
good	news		
here	was	a	queer	bird		
the	next	offensive	came	while	they	were	crossing	the	rockies		
at	the	north	side	of	the	hotel	was	an	alley		
the	woman	who	had	forgotten	her	kimono	rushed	into	the	arms	of	another	woman	statuesque	whitehaired

i	'm	stating	bald	facts

that	bucks	me	up	a	lot	mat		
oh	but	he	is	n't	a	man	sarah		
he	would	have	made	a	scene	just	the	same		
without	vehemence		
here	is	a	box		
an	infinitesimal	clue	she	had	left	that	because	she	would	not	have	been	human	else		
it	is	very	wonderful	to	be	here	tonight	he	said		
there	was	a	chill	of	fear	too		
in	a	white	pith	helmet

i	tried	to	slip	out	at	the	side	but	i	was	not	quick	enough		
i	'll	wait		
i	sha'n't	bother	you	more	than	ten	minutes	just	enough	time	to	get	my	nerves	steadied		
it	was	stinging	cold	somewhere	around	zero		
mathison	listened	politely		
he	tossed	his	cap	on	the	bureau	yawned	luxuriously	for	he	was	tired	and	sat	down	on	the	edge	of	the	bed	to	take	off	his	shoes	but	he	immediately	ceased	all	movement		
yes		
my	cabin	is	opposite	yours		
yes	george		
dey	wo	n't	be	no	trimmin	's	like	yo'd	get	at	de	hotel		
it	may	be	the	turningpoint		
she	broke	the	tableau	by	taking	from	the	pocket	of	her	gray	coat	a	gray	veil	which	she	wound	about	her	head	turbanwise	dropping	the	edge	just	above	her	lips		
goodlookers		
her	face	alight	with	joy	was	beautiful	but	there	was	a	subtle	hint	that	in	repose	it	would	be	tragic		
the	solution	is	apparent	it	does	not	signify	carelessness		
mathison	could	not	tell	whether	she	was	asleep	or	awake		
i	'll	open	it		
from	time	to	time	he	made	gestures	they	were	catlike		
there	was	a	peculiar	odor	in	the	air		
i	will	kill	you	if	you	lay	a	hand	on	me		
no	tedious	affair	of	the	courts	cold	formal	justice		
what	are	you	telling	me		
he	carried	a	revolver		
the	blond	man	as	he	looked	into	mathison	's	eyes	sensed	that	he	was	about	to	fight	for	his	life	thus	he	became	endowed	with	a	frenzy	which	doubled	his	strength		
i	'd	like	very	much	if	you	'd	call	me	john		
and	umballa	smiled	again		
and	bring	the	mines	to	the	arena		
the	white	hunter	was	free	to	come	and	go	and	the	sleepy	soldiers	saw	the	water	skin	which	ramabai	threw	carelessly	over	his	head		
they	hurried	back	as	fast	as	kathlyn	's	weakness	would	permit	to	where	they	had	left	their	own	elephants	doubting	that	they	should	find	them	considering	that	it	was	quite	probable	that	they	had	joined	their	wild	brethren		
the	british	raj	does	not	want	a	great	border	war	and	i	can	bring	down	ten	thousand	wild	hillmen	outlaws	between	whom	and	the	british	raj	there	is	a	blood	feud	ten	thousand	from	a	land	where	there	is	never	peace	only	truce		
yes		
cried	bruce		
he	is	moribund		
follow	me		
your	father	was	one	of	the	best	friends	i	had		
some	careful	hunter	had	once	possessed	it	for	it	was	abundantly	oiled		
god		
		
		
they	examined	the	elephants	but	were	baffled	there	owing	to	ahmed	's	foresight		
kathlyn	memsahib	bore	a	charmed	life	and	all	the	wild	beasts	of	the	jungles	of	hind	could	not	harm	her		
to	struggle	would	reward	her	with	nothing	but	shame	and	humiliation	so	she	bent	her	head	to	the	inevitable		
in	her	halting	hindustani	she	spoke	i	have	something	to	say	to	you	all		
was	her	father	alive		
now	i	must	be	off		
umballa	knew	that	i	would	return	for	them	and	laid	his	plans		
my	people	are	sometimes	children	in	that	they	need	constant	amusement		
the	old	man	behind	her	nodded	approvingly	hearing	the	sound	but	not	sensing	its	import		
and	he	really	believed	he	had		
he	was	sitting	cross	legged	and	rocking	back	and	forth		
seen	what		
from	his	great	padded	paws	to	his	sloping	shoulders	he	stood	easily	four	feet	in	height	and	his	stripes	were	almost	as	broad	as	her	hand		
on	through	the	narrow	streets	sometimes	the	sides	of	the	elephants	scraping	against	the	mud	and	plaster	of	the	buildings	and	one	could	easily	look	into	the	second	stories		
the	house	was	not	guarded	then	so	he	had	no	difficulty	in	gaining	admittance		
can	you	possibly	commit	such	a	dreadful	crime	against	one	who	has	never	harmed	you	who	asks	for	nothing	but	the	freedom	to	leave	this	country		
he	shall	stand	prepared	that	is	all		
it	entered	her	mind	clearly	that	these	poor	foolish	people	really	believed	her	a	celestial	being	and	so	long	as	they	laid	no	hand	upon	her	she	was	not	alarmed		
the	wild	elephants	stampeded	and	rajah	disgruntled	was	brought	to	the	compass		
god	's	curse	on	all	these	worthless	stones	men	call	guns		
he	vowed	death	to	the	foul	hands	which	had	done	this	sacrilege		
you	'll	know	how	to	soothe	him	if	he	becomes	nervous		
from	afar	she	could	hear	shouting		
the	populace	surged		
and	to	force	a	crown	on	me		
i	will	go	memsahib	and	more	i	will	bring	him	back		
blandly		
he	finally	lost	patience	and	swept	back	the	curtain	despite	bruce	's	restraining	hand		
what	now		
hush	baby		
knock	off	those	chains	said	kathlyn		
who	was	ahmed		
		
rajah	must	have	outstripped	them	two	or	three	miles		
there	were	some	there	who	had	umballa	to	thank	for	their	miseries		
hast	ever	been	thirsty	highness		
		
but	he	grew	very	lonely	at	the	thought	of	kathlyn	eventually	going	into	another	home	and	some	young	chap	would	soon	come	and	claim	winnie	and	he	would	have	no	one	but	ahmed		
all	we	ask	is	that	you	abide	with	us	till	you	have	legally	selected	your	successor		
to	wring	the	white	man	's	heart	was	something		
she	saw	the	brute	pause	turn	and	strike	at	the	helpless	man	at	the	wheel	then	lope	off	doubtless	having	in	mind	to	test	his	freedom	before	he	fed		
ramabai	's	garden		
the	regular	highway	was	a	moderately	decent	road	which	led	along	the	banks	of	one	of	those	streams	which	eventually	join	the	sacred	jumna		
indeed		
the	many	recent	commotions	within	and	without	the	temple	had	finally	roused	his	ire		
bring	him	to	the	house	of	durga	ram		
if	only	he	had	had	a	boy	to	bring	his	bride	to	his	father	's	roof		
thus	the	durbar	ended		
the	blue	eyes	alone	might	have	caused	remarks	but	this	was	a	negligible	danger	since	color	and	costume	detracted		
my	wife	will	not	be	molested	in	any	way	for	remaining	at	the	bungalow		
the	curtains	were	thrust	aside	and	the	painted	dancing	girl	who	had	saved	umballa	from	death	or	capture	in	the	fire	of	his	own	contriving	rushed	in		
by	the	shroud	of	the	prophet	what	can	this	mean		
it	was	well	guarded	and	by	men	who	had	never	been	close	to	umballa	but	had	always	belonged	to	the	dissatisfied	section	the	frankly	and	openly	mutinous	section		
three	days	sahib		
we	must	form	our	plans	quickly		
and	tell	me	the	story	of	the	warrior	queen		
he	cried		
the	man	was	mad	stark	mad	this	night		
colonel	said	bruce	i	'd	going	to	get	some	cartridges		
she	prayed	that	she	might	die	instantly		
better	death	on	the	pyre	than	a	future	like	that	of	a	pariah	dog		
ai	ai		
and	he	will	fight	like	a	rat	this	time	mark	me		
they	were	the	best	mannered	of	the	half	dozen	owned	or	rented	by	colonel	hare		
commanded	bruce		
it	was	enough	for	winnie		
but	these	warnings	to	umballa		
get	behind	me	and	crouch	low		
what	caste	would	those	dancers	be	ramabai		
her	gloved	hands	were	clenched		
russia	possesses	an	accurate	knowledge	of	every	fort	ship	and	gun	england	boasts	of	france	germany	and	japan		
i	'll	be	silent	but	i	refuse	to	lie	to	nancy	on	your	account		
have	a	little	patience		
scraping	off	that	beard	made	me	forgetful		
well	perhaps	in	a	few	days		
you	wish	to	leave	my	service		
it	aches	a	little	when	it	rains	that	's	about	all		
and	i	trusted	you	as	a	friend	as	a	gentleman	as	a	man	of	honor		
i	am	rich	from	hour	to	hour	from	day	to	day	what	shall	i	not	plan	to	make	her	happy		
with	an	air	of	resignation	and	a	clear	sense	of	the	proportion	of	things	he	reached	out	and	took	up	the	note	upon	which	annesley	had	scrawled	his	signature		
he	passed	secretly	from	the	house	and	hung	around	the	bowwindow	which	let	out	on	the	low	balcony		
i	am	on	the	way	to	the	war	department		
if	he	could	have	got	rid	of	the	idea	of	karloff	and	the	possibilities	which	his	name	suggested	all	this	would	have	appealed	to	him	as	exceedingly	funny		
if	he	was	hideous	would	you	be	putting	on	those	ribbons	i	gave	you	to	wear	on	sundays		
a	change	came	over	karloff	's	countenance	his	shoulders	drooped	the	melancholy	fire	died	out	of	his	face	and	eyes		
i	wish	to	ride	alone		
but	this	child	of	mine	whom	i	love	doubly	for	her	mother	's	sake	and	her	own	i	would	gladly	cut	off	both	arms	to	spare	her	a	single	pain	to	keep	her	in	the	luxury	which	she	still	believes	rightfully	to	be	hers		
obstacles	are	nothing	the	end	is	everything		
i	knew	that	such	a	thing	had	no	rightful	place	in	this	house		
sir	she	began		
there	is	some	difference	between	a	dinnertable	and	a	horse	miss.		
you	shall	not	have	even	me	who	love	you	after	a	fashion	for	i	could	never	look	upon	you	as	a	husband	in	my	eyes	you	would	always	be	an	accomplice		
then	he	leaned	with	his	back	against	the	mantel	and	faced	them	or	rather	karloff	of	whom	he	was	not	quite	sure		
have	you	been	a	soldier		
this	groom	certainly	looked	right	but	there	was	something	lacking	in	his	makeup	that	indefinable	something	which	is	always	found	in	the	true	servantservility		
she	eyed	him	her	head	inclined	roguishly	to	one	side	the	exact	attitude	of	a	bird	that	has	suddenly	met	a	curious	and	disturbing	specimen	of	insect	life		
you	had	better	dine	with	us	and	spend	the	evening	with	your	friend		
go	to	the	colonel	frankly	pay	his	debts	out	of	your	own	pockets	then	tell	the	girl	that	you	love	her		
and	now	russia	finds	that	she	must	proceed	to	do	what	she	has	done	to	all	other	countries	that	is	duplicate	her	rival	's	fortification	plans	her	total	military	and	naval	strength	and	so	forth	and	so	on		
honestly	i	'll	think	it	over	jack

his	knowledge	had	proved	of	no	small	value	to	the	government	for	he	was	a	born	strategist	and	his	hobby	was	the	coast	defenses		
as	a	storyteller	i	am	supposed	to	be	everywhere	to	follow	the	footsteps	of	each	and	all	of	my	characters	and	with	a	fidelity	and	a	perspicacity	nothing	short	of	the	marvelous		
had	any	one	called	her	attention	to	all	this	there	is	n't	any	doubt	that	she	would	have	been	shocked

with	a	swish	she	was	gone

miss	annesley	i	frankly	admitted	on	the	spot	was	next	to	nancy	the	handsomest	girl	i	ever	saw	and	as	i	thought	of	mr.	robert	in	his	den	at	home	i	sincerely	pitied	him		
sighed	nancy		
had	he	not	played	at	this	comedy	this	thing	would	have	gone	on	and	he	would	have	been	in	ignorance	of	its	very	existence		
it	was	mr.	warburton	's	fault	that	he	did	not	take	first	prize		
everybody	had	something	to	say	to	everybody	else	and	a	butler	was	only	a	machine	anyway		
he	strove	to	look	away		
he	placed	it	on	a	number		
and	this	is	the	fellow	we	saw	in	the	policecourt	sitting	among	those	light	o	loves		
i	love	her	with	all	my	heart,"hotly		
a	groom	is	not	supposed	to	turn	his	head	when	on	the	box	unless	spoken	to		
come	to	zee	dininghall		
the	first	thing	he	did	was	to	drop	the	silver	ladle		
very	well	sir		
it	is	true	that	i	take	a	drink	once	in	a	while	when	i	have	been	riding	or	driving	all	day	or	when	i	am	cold		
and	if	men	have	souls	as	we	are	told	they	have	how	the	souls	of	these	men	must	writhe	as	they	look	into	the	minds	of	living	men	and	behold	the	horror	and	contempt	in	which	each	traitor	's	name	is	held	there		
you	ask	for	something	which	i	can	not	give	and	each	time	you	ask	you	only	add	to	the	pain		
several	times	with	my	major	's	daughter,"thoughtlessly		
karloff	was	a	brave	man		
if	it	's	she	why	that	altogether	alters	the	face	of	things		
now	hold	him		
that	'll	be	rather	serious		
underneath	on	a	little	shelf	he	saw	a	stack	of	worn	envelopes		
thank	you	sir		
he	lifted	his	handsome	head	resolutely		
so	i	admit		
warburton	's	pulse	doubled	its	beat		
he	was	passionately	fond	of	music		
she	discoursed	on	wines	in	french	with	the	ambassador	and	immediately	turned	to	the	chinaman	and	recited	confucius	in	the	original	chinese		
you	look	so	earnest		
i	am	base	i	who	have	always	considered	myself	an	honorable	man		
if	it	was	a	smile	he	would	have	given	much	to	know	what	had	caused	it		
had	your	breakfast		
but	if	the	united	states	found	out	what	russia	was	doing	there	might	be	war		
i	was	just	about	to	turn	into	the	club	for	my	mail	declared	the	colonel		
when	no	two	critics	think	alike	of	what	use	is	criticism		
his	game	leg	ached	cruelly	and	after	the	second	mile	which	was	traversed	without	speech	from	either	of	them	he	fell	into	a	slight	limp		
he	was	in	the	war	department	until	a	year	or	so	ago		
oh		
warburton	glanced	quickly	about	all	was	neatness		
first	shot	at	the	groom		
after	all	love	is	a	primitive	state	and	with	it	we	go	back	to	the	beginning	before	it	honor	or	dishonor	is	nothing		
you	have	reached	the	age	of	discretion
