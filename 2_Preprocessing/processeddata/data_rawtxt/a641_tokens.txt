you	ought	to	get	into	bed	and	have	a	doctor		
so	were	the	proprieties	complied	with	and	so	began	the	enslavement	of	christopher		
it	did	him	good	that	is	to	say	it	brought	colour	to	his	face	and	enabled	him	to	sit	upright		
not	likely	answered	gammon		
the	rummiest	thing	that	that	never	came	into	my	head		
i	do	n't	want	to	mr.	gammon		
in	threadneedle	street	a	hand	arrested	him		
greenacre	had	not	overpraised	the	cobs	their	start	promised	an	enjoyable	day		
and	you	always	come	just	this	way	'cause	it	's	nice	and	convenient	for	lambeth	road	ai	n't	it		
you	reserve	to	yourself	i	presume	the	duty	of	acquainting	her	with	these	painful	facts		
aunt	louisa	's	been	making	a	bother	has	she		
best	is	near	a	board	school	when	the	children	are	about		
she	exclaimed	at	length	in	profound	agitation	that	explains	so	many	things		
that	's	what	i	like	about	you	you	always	look	respectable		
oh	yes	of	course		
and	i	do	n't	know	you	either	after	tonight	so	just	remember	that	mr.	parish		
you	've	nowhere	to	sleepain't	that	it		
what	do	you	mean	by	it	mrs.	bubb		
asked	his	hostess		
we	will	say	nothing	to	her	yet	if	you	please		
he	added	a	brief	account	of	what	had	happened	between	polly	and	her	uncle	greenacre	listening	as	if	this	threw	new	light	on	the	case		
quodlings	traveller		
he	had	set	his	mind	on	discovering	mrs.	clover	's	husband	and	was	all	the	more	determined	to	perform	this	feat	since	the	recent	events	in	kennington	road		
i	hoped	you	were	going	to	walk	urged	christopher	timidly		
now	he	would	not	visit	her	he	would	not	write		
the	girl	laughed	loudly	as	if	at	a	preposterous	question		
when	he	went	forth	into	the	cold	street	never	was	man	more	softly	amorous	more	mirthfully	exultant	more	kindly	disposed	to	all	the	dwellers	upon	earth		
polly	grew	hot	with	anger	then	subsided	into	mortification		
so	saying	he	took	his	leave	with	bows	and	flourishes		
flecks	of	dim	white	had	for	some	minutes	been	visible	above	their	heads	it	was	beginning	to	snow		
you	're	a	man	of	business	are	you	not		
oh	i	've	a	good	memory	for	faces		
well	mr.	gammon	i	do	think	but	the	landlady	's	protest	was	cut	short	by	a	loud	slamming	of	the	housedoor		
nonsense		
it	returned	upon	both	with	the	freshness	of	surprise	even	polly	had	quite	lost	sight	of	the	startling	fact	during	the	last	few	minutes		
now	then	give	an	account	of	yourself		
both	of	them	it	seemed	bore	a	likeness	to	some	profligate	aristocrat		
with	a	marked	display	of	interesting	embarrassment	miss	waghorn	introduced	him	to	her	companion	mr.	nibby	who	showed	himself	cordial		
he	could	not	determine	whether	he	had	given	her	up	or	not	he	did	not	know	whether	to	bow	before	mrs.	clover	or	to	protest	and	persevere		
at	a	second	meeting	with	the	venerable	bagmanwho	had	a	wonderful	head	for	whiskygammon	acquired	so	much	technical	information	that	oil	and	colours	might	fairly	be	set	down	among	his	numerous	specialities		
you	nasty	ungrateful	young	woman	you		
of	all	the	shimeless	creatures		
a	few	days	after	this	minnie	's	mother	overcoming	a	secret	scruple	and	yielding	to	a	long	desire	allowed	herself	to	write	a	letter	to	mr.	gammon		
i	've	had	a	present	given	to	me	well	what	of	that		
but	this	was	the	last	day	save	one	of	polly	's	week	and	as	yet	she	had	given	no	sign		
why	i	've	as	good	as	forgot	there	was	such	a	man		
instantly	a	man	sprang	forward	to	her	defence	and	he	too	planted	his	fist	between	the	eyes	of	the	hapless	peer		
then	mrs.	cloveras	we	call	herwasn't	really	his	wife	at	all		
all	right	if	you	wo	n't	do	it	say	so	and	i	'll	ask	somebody	else		
what	you	've	got	to	do	my	angel	is	to	find	where	that	lady	livesthe	one	that	sat	next	our	friend	you	know	not	the	foreigner		
replied	the	other	as	cheerfully	as	he	could		
on	the	walls	hung	three	brightlycoloured	calendars	each	an	advertisement	one	of	sewing	machines	one	of	a	popular	insurance	office	one	of	a	local	grocery	business		
polly	was	short	with	him		
it	came	so	sudden		
i	'm	so	glad	you	happened	to	drop	in		
i	'm	sure	it	would	be	better	and	i	may	be	able	to	give	you	a	reason	before	long		
gammon	looked	at	his	watch		
polly	went	down	into	the	kitchen	where	mrs.	cheeseman	a	stout	woman	of	slatternly	appearance	was	sitting	with	her	legs	crossed	and	a	plate	of	shrimps	in	her	lap		
i	am	not	welcome	how	could	i	expect	to	be		
they	're	all	right	in	their	way		
look	on	the	writing	table	greenacre		
i	do	so	then	gammon		
mrs.	bubb	vented	her	emotions	in	oh	my		
time	i	was	gettin	ome		
polly	had	never	been	so	tempted	to	commit	an	assault	she	thought	with	a	burning	brain	how	effective	would	be	one	smart	stroke	on	the	dish	of	sausages	with	the	handle	of	her	umbrella		
hanged	if	i	see	why	she	should	n't	come	forward		
i	'm	going	to	break	your	door	open	that	's	all	and	i	wish	to	give	you	fair	warning		
gammon	presently	went	downstairs	and	told	mrs.	clover	that	her	husband	wished	to	go	into	town	on	business		
and	considering	the	polperro	reputation	it	would	n't	surprise	me	to	come	across	a	good	many	such	noses		
at	forty	years	of	age	gammon	set	off	about	his	business	with	all	the	zest	of	a	healthy	boy		
there	was	only	one	consolation	and	that	a	poor	one		
what	friend		
a	few	draughts	of	a	restorative	enabled	lord	polperro	to	articulate	and	he	inquired	if	any	letters	had	arrived	for	him		
then	i	think	you	have	acted	very	wisely	indeedas	one	might	have	expected	from	miss	sparkes		
shrieked	the	girl	turning	furiously	upon	her	relative		
cried	the	other		
she	opened	the	door	wide	and	he	saw	by	the	light	from	the	street	that	she	was	dressed	as	usual		
h'm		
afraid	not	replied	the	traveller	but	i	know	a	man	out	hoxton	way	who	's	pushing	a	new	lampglass	cleaner		
might	i	suggest	with	all	deference	that	we	should	dine	together	very	quietly		
it	may	be	a	lie	remarked	mrs.	bubb		
gammon	grew	perplexed	in	mind	and	shadowed	in	countenance		
no	he	would	on	no	account	be	seated		
do	i	really	believe	that	at	any	time	of	my	life	i	have	been	the	kind	of	man	who	merits	affection		
if	my	voice	had	any	authority	i	would	cry	this	truth	aloud	wherever	men	could	hear		
for	the	nature	of	the	universe	having	made	all	reasonable	creatures	one	for	another	to	the	end	that	they	should	do	one	another	good	more	or	less	according	to	the	several	persons	and	occasions	but	in	no	wise	hurt	one	another	it	is	manifest	that	he	that	doth	transgress	against	this	her	will	is	guilty	of	impiety	towards	the	most	ancient	and	venerable	of	all	the	deities

thereupon	the	speaker	in	rather	a	blustering	tone	cried	out	yes	i	can	make	a	very	good	breakfast	on	two	or	three	pounds	of	apples		
a	shrewd	and	vigorous	man	of	business	such	as	dickens	aided	by	a	lawyer	who	was	his	devoted	friend	could	do	even	better	and	in	reaping	sometimes	more	than	his	publisher	redress	the	ancient	injustice

years	after	that	i	recall	another	black	morning		
never	did	silly	mortal	reap	such	harvest	of	experience	never	had	any	one	so	many	bruises	to	show	for	it

the	prophets	the	martyrs	their	noble	anguish	vain	and	meaningless	the	wise	whose	thought	strove	to	eternity	and	was	but	an	idle	dream	the	pure	in	heart	whose	life	was	a	vision	of	the	living	god	the	suffering	and	the	mourners	whose	solace	was	in	a	world	to	come	the	victims	of	injustice	who	cried	to	the	judge	supremeall	gone	down	into	silence	and	the	globe	that	bare	them	circling	dead	and	cold	through	soundless	space

if	so	optimism	has	to	content	itself	with	rather	doubtful	generalities		
for	me	what	is	called	the	unknowable	is	simply	the	nonexistent

for	a	man	whose	life	's	business	it	has	been	to	study	the	english	tongue	what	joy	can	equal	that	of	marking	the	happy	ease	wherewith	shakespeare	surpasses	in	mere	command	of	words	every	achievement	of	those	even	who	apart	from	him	are	great

can	it	truly	be	said	that	most	men	find	the	wishes	of	their	youth	satisfied	in	later	life		
i	could	never	ask	from	a	landlady	anything	which	was	not	in	our	bond	and	only	once	or	twice	did	i	receive	spontaneous	offer	of	help		
yet	he	would	never	dream	that	i	envied	him	he	would	think	it	as	probable	no	doubt	that	i	should	compare	myself	unfavourably	with	one	of	the	farm	horses

when	first	i	read	that	passage	it	represented	exactly	the	state	of	my	own	mind	to	think	of	italy	was	to	feel	myself	goaded	by	a	longing	which	at	times	made	me	literally	ill	i	too	had	put	aside	my	latin	books	simply	because	i	could	not	endure	the	torment	of	imagination	they	caused	me		
and	one	may	safely	say	that	of	all	the	ages	since	a	coin	first	became	the	symbol	of	power	ours	is	that	in	which	it	yields	to	the	majority	of	its	possessors	the	poorest	return	in	heart	's	contentment

late	at	night	i	shall	walk	all	the	way	back	to	islington	most	likely	singing	as	i	go		
it	is	idle	to	talk	to	us	of	the	greeks		
i	too	may	perhaps	live	for	some	years	but	for	me	there	is	no	more	activity	no	ambition		
i	have	heard	an	impatient	innovator	scoff	at	the	english	law	on	the	subject	of	mustard	and	demand	why	in	the	nature	of	things	mustard	should	not	be	eaten	with	mutton		
i	note	too	that	his	leisure	is	not	swamped	with	the	publications	of	the	day	he	reads	as	many	old	books	as	new	and	keeps	many	of	his	early	enthusiasms		
she	brings	the	little	table	within	the	glow	of	the	hearth	so	that	i	can	help	myself	without	changing	my	easy	position		
but	in	those	old	days	if	i	am	not	mistaken	i	rather	preferred	the	seasons	of	bad	weather	i	had	in	fact	the	true	instinct	of	townsfolk	which	finds	pleasure	in	the	triumph	of	artificial	circumstance	over	natural	conditions	delighting	in	a	glare	and	tumult	of	busy	life	under	hostile	heavens	which	elsewhere	would	mean	shivering	illcontent

before	her	mind	's	eye	was	the	picture	of	denzil	quarrier	's	studyits	luxury	brightness	wealth	of	volumes	and	denzil	's	face	made	an	inseparable	part	of	the	scene		
he	had	talked	himself	into	a	tremor	and	the	exhibition	of	feeling	astonished	his	brother	whoas	is	so	often	the	case	between	brothershad	never	suspected	what	lay	beneath	the	surface	of	eustace	's	dilettante	life		
his	sister	was	reading	there	in	solitude		
eustace	well	again		
i	am	quite	sure	he	is	an	honourable	manquite	sure	i	believe	he	has	very	high	thoughts		
if	he	entertained	guests	they	were	people	of	his	own	kind	who	thought	more	of	the	hearty	welcome	than	of	what	was	set	before	them		
apart	with	lilian	mrs.	liversedge	had	begun	to	talk	of	the	society	of	polterham		
he	looked	at	the	halfcrown	smiled	and	handed	it	to	the	cabman		
i	have	heard	this	calumny	before	and	i	have	been	told	how	it	has	arisen		
then	he	cursed	the	man	marks	whose	political	schemes	would	betray	the	valuable	secret	and	make	it	certain	that	none	of	that	more	substantial	assistance	promised	by	quarrier	would	ever	be	given		
i	think	you	can	believe	me	dear		
do	let	me	know	how	lilian	is		
they	were	at	st.	luke	's	last	sunday	mrs.	walker	was	able	to	declare	though	her	wonted	timidity	again	threw	some	suspicion	on	the	statement		
i	have	nothing	whatever	to	do	with	politics		
it	's	a	strange	coincidence	she	said	at	length	very	strange	that	this	should	happen	on	the	eve	of	the	election		
you	astonish	me		
mrs.	wade	he	said	as	soon	as	the	door	had	closed	should	n't	i	do	better	to	throw	up	the	game		
he	looked	northway	in	the	eyes		
poor	serena		
will	you	allow	me	to	be	your	intermediary		
i	was	brutal	as	i	often	am	and	the	poor	girl	began	to	cry		
that	morning	there	had	occurred	a	quarrel	of	more	than	usual	bitterness	between	mother	and	daughter		
the	calendar	on	his	writingtable	reminded	him	that	it	was	thursday		
he	had	taken	especial	care	to	have	her	dressed	in	the	manner	that	became	his	wife	parisian	science	had	gone	to	the	making	of	her	costume	and	its	efforts	were	not	wasted

i	shall	be	so	glad	toto	help	you	in	any	way	i	canso	very	glad		
but	the	next	instant	she	was	aware	of	the	stranger	who	stood	in	obvious	embarrassment		
the	best	of	all	between	eleven	at	night	and	two	in	the	morning		
you	'll	hear	his	answer		
and	pray	asked	denzil	with	a	laugh	what	would	be	the	result	of	giving	the	franchise	to	such	women		
youa	man	of	your	standingno	no	it	was	completely	a	mistake	believe	me		
there	mrs.	wade	visited	her	and	they	talked	for	a	long	time	it	was	decided	that	lilian	should	go	to	peartree	cottage	on	the	following	afternoon	and	remain	in	seclusion	until	the	contest	was	over		
i	will	go	and	talk	to	all	the	people	we	know	really		
on	her	first	arrival	in	the	town	she	wore	the	garb	of	recent	widowhood	relatives	here	she	had	none	but	an	old	friendship	existed	between	her	and	the	occupants	of	this	house	a	childless	couple	named	hornibrook		
so	you	go	to	sicily		
she	was	to	come	back	with	mr.	becket	and	the	boys	and	then	go	to	her	people		
nothing	less	than	an	accusation	of	bribery	and	corruption		
lilian	rose	to	her	feet	and	moaned	despairingly		
denzil	uttered	a	few	violent	oaths	reminiscences	of	the	navy		
you	hear	what	i	say		
let	us	talk	in	the	carriage		
i	know	it	is	wiser	to	do	so		
denzil	felt	no	need	of	assistance	in	drawing	up	the	manifesto	which	would	shortly	be	addressed	to	liberal	polterham	but	hammond	was	a	pleasant	fellow	of	the	goahead	species	and	his	editorial	pen	would	be	none	the	less	zealous	for	confidences	such	as	this		
i	am	telling	the	story	without	her	leave	butwell	in	a	way	as	i	said	the	necessity	is	forced	upon	me		
northway	drew	in	his	cheeks	and	stared	at	her	persistently		
but	the	beginning	is	everything		
no	i	do	n't	ask	you	to	come	and	live	with	me	at	once	i	do	n't	expect	that		
lilian	became	my	wife	for	good	and	allno	doubt	about	that		
i	shall	walk	on	into	clifton	so	here	we	say	goodbye	for	the	present	a	week	or	ten	days		
now	listen	pursued	the	speaker	shifting	about	in	his	chair		
tobias	himself	had	yielded	to	the	spirit	of	the	hour	he	told	merry	stories	of	incidents	that	had	come	under	his	notice	 	that	morning		
denzil	assisted	his	companion	to	alight	and	whilst	she	was	opening	the	housedoor	bade	the	coachman	go	up	and	down	till	he	was	summoned		
and	bythebye	it	's	time	you	called	on	the	catesbys		
but	he	faced	about	again	abruptly	laughed	held	out	his	hand		
we	go	to	sicily	for	the	honeymoon		
i	know	what	the	end	of	this'll	be		
marvellous	to	say	they	were	encouraged	in	this	view	by	people	whom	providence	had	blessed	with	all	the	satisfactions	that	earth	can	give		
to	whom		
the	radicals	have	often	tried	to	draw	me	into	their	camp	and	of	course	it	's	taken	for	granted	that	i	am	rather	for	than	against	them		
then	he	spoke	very	quietly		
what	a	hope	had	come	to	her	of	a	sudden	last	autumn		
i	do	n't	say	then	wait	till	we	know	something	definite	growled	mr.	vawdrey		
if	you	will	consent	to	follow	in	the	path	i	have	prepared		
i	do	n't	mind	going	so	far	as	to	declare	that	i	share	this	dissatisfaction		
nothing	unexpected	had	befallen	there	was	an	account	of	the	nomination	and	plenty	of	rancour	against	the	radicals	but	assuredly	up	to	the	hour	of	the	mercury	's	going	to	press	no	public	scandal	had	exploded	in	polterham		
they	'll	all	go	to	huxtable	's	that	's	what	they	'll	do		
i	sha'n't	let	you	go	back		
you	shall	hear	about	it	afterwards		
he	laughed	outright		
he	stood	up		
the	sagas	probably		
i	suppose	so		
rarely	in	this	century	has	there	been	an	occasion	more	critical		
what	can	that	be		
he	called	in	a	low	voice		
you		
do	let	me	know	what	it	is	she	replied	in	a	low	voice		
he	's	weak	that	's	all		
judging	from	what	i	have	heard	of	your	talk		
did	n't	i	say	she	came	from	denmark		
feeling	that	all	eyes	were	fixed	upon	him	glazzard	made	an	uneasy	movement	and	rose	from	his	chair		
lilian	exclaimed	raising	herself		
but	then	no	doubt	your	father	told	him	the	rest	or	has	done	by	this	time
