as	we	passed	the	head	of	the	lane	that	led	down	to	the	beach	i	noticed	a	single	figure	moving	slowly	along	it	seawards

thank	you	so	much	for	coming	out	to	tell	me	and	thinking	he	had	now	said	all	he	had	come	to	say	i	held	out	my	hand	to	bid	him	good	night		
and	be	very	good	and	obedient.’	the	lamb	’s	speech		
there	each	would	find	a	comfortable	room	provided	for	her	and	also	a	cheap	secondhand	pianoforte	on	which	she	might	play	for	hours	without	adding	one	needless	pang	to	the	sum	of	human	misery	lady	muriel	glanced	round	in	alarm	lest	these	barbarous	sentiments	should	be	overheard

however	it	took	in	one	of	her	audience	and	bruno	hastened	to	interpose	as	peacemaker	in	a	rising	quarrel	with	the	remark	i	likes	peoples	arthur	laid	a	loving	hand	on	the	little	curly	head		
and	bruno	was	ever	so	frightened	and	he	ran——	no	he	was	n’t	flightened	a	bit	bruno	interrupted		
crabbed	age	and	youth	can	not	live	together	the	old	man	cheerfully	replied	with	a	most	genial	smile		
quick		
why	that	’s	true	he	murmured	to	himself		
that	’s	sylvie	singing		
bruno	’s	speech	to	the	lion		
it	is	n’t	as	hot	as	it	might	be	the	professor	replied	catching	at	the	first	idea	that	came	to	hand		
had	n’t	it	he	enquired		
i	could	explain	it	in	in	but	you	would	not	understand	it	no	indeed	said	lady	muriel	graciously	dispensing	with	the	name	of	the	unknown	language		
assuming	it	to	have	no	moral	responsibility	is	n’t	that	a	greater	mystery	than	a	man	overdriving	a	horse	i	think	it	is	said	lady	muriel	looking	a	mute	appeal	to	her	father		
now	let	me	ask	you	another	question		
it	’s	too	important	a	question	to	be	settled	by	amateurs		
something	wonderful	like	 	fortunatus	’s	purse		
after	the	examination	he	mentioned	to	me	the	few	facts	which	he	knew	but	had	not	been	able	to	bring	in	and	i	can	assure	you	they	were	trivial	sir	absolutely	trivial	i	feebly	expressed	my	surprise	and	delight		
there	were	only	some	eight	or	nine	left	to	whom	the	count	was	explaining	for	the	twentieth	time	how	he	had	had	his	eye	on	the	children	during	the	last	verse	of	the	song	how	he	had	then	glanced	round	the	room	to	see	what	effect	de	great	chestnote	had	had	upon	his	audience	and	how	when	he	looked	back	again	they	had	both	disappeared	when	exclamations	of	dismay	began	to	be	heard	on	all	sides	the	count	hastily	bringing	his	story	to	an	end	to	join	in	the	outcry		
they	are	either	vapid	or	controversial		
good	night	little	ones	said	the	professor		
instead	of	saying	what	book	shall	i	write?’	an	author	will	ask	himself	which	book	shall	i	write?’	a	mere	verbal	distinction	lady	muriel	gave	me	an	approving	smile		
to	shelter	the	sane	said	arthur		
and	he	went	to	buy	some	sweeties	in	a	shop		
and	the	old	sheep	said	do	you	know	your	a	b	c	yet		
the	professor	looked	at	his	watch		
care,’	you	know	killed	the	cat		
three	cheers	for	the	emperor	the	faintest	possible	sound	followed	this	announcement	and	the	chancellor	with	admirable	presence	of	mind	instantly	proclaimed	a	speech	from	the	emperor	the	emperor	had	begun	his	speech	almost	before	the	words	were	uttered		
there	certainly	was	a	sort	of	witchery	of	beauty	about	them		
course	he	knows	no	better	if	he	’s	flench		
it	’s	difficult	to	get	things	started	the	professor	remarked	to	bruno		
we	would	not	concern	ourselves		
then	chorus	agin	was	shouted	out	by	one	of	the	redfaced	men	in	the	window	and	forthwith	a	dozen	voices	yelled	to	a	harsh	discordant	melody	the	refrain:—	  	there	’s	him	an’	yo’	an’	me	            	roarin’	laddies		
i	like	to	think	of	you	as	an	old	friend	—though	you	do	n’t	look	it	would	have	been	the	almost	necessary	sequence	with	any	other	lady	but	she	and	i	seemed	to	have	long	passed	out	of	the	time	when	compliments	or	any	such	trivialities	were	possible		
it	has	introductory	verses	at	the	beginning	and	at	the	end	it	ca’n’t	have	introductory	verses	at	the	end	can	it	said	sylvie		
sylvie	he	said	in	a	perfectly	audible	whisper		
and	when	it	had	nubbled	all	his	head	off	he	went	away	and	he	never	said	thank	you’	that	were	very	rude	said	bruno		
by	this	time	the	other	guests	had	arrived	and	dinner	was	announced		
this	must	be	looked	into	he	muttered	to	himself	taking	out	a	notebook		
do	you	know	i	think	we	began	as	old	friends	she	said	with	a	playfulness	of	tone	that	ill	accorded	with	the	tears	that	glistened	in	her	eyes		
that	jump	would	take	it	at	least	five	miles		
who	then	are	these	dear	children	i	pray	you	he	said		
say	that	took	ten	times	as	long	you	see	we	have	unlimited	time	to	deal	with		
something	about	a	duck	i	hazarded		
no	bad	news	sir	i	hope	my	landlady	said	as	she	saw	me	out		
and	when	he	had	got	a	little	way	he	thought	he	would	look	into	the	hamper	and	see	how	the	little	foxes	were	getting	on	so	he	opened	the	door——	said	bruno		
is	that	all	i	asked	despondingly		
i	entirely	agree	with	you	said	lady	muriel	but	do	n’t	orthodox	writers	condemn	that	view	as	putting	man	on	the	level	of	the	lower	animals		
it	is	a	melancholy	pleasure	to	place	on	record	the	names	of	these	genuine	martyrs	than	whom	none	surely	are	more	worthy	to	be	entered	on	the	gloryroll	of	england	’s	heroes		
little	birds	are	playing	bagpipes	on	the	shore	where	the	tourists	snore	  	thanks	they	cry		
i	heard	it	had	all	come	to	an	end	i	would	like	to	tell	you	how	it	happened	she	said	as	that	is	the	very	point	i	want	your	advice	about		
is	it	life	or	death	i	asked	him	as	soon	as	we	were	far	enough	from	the	house	for	me	to	speak	in	ordinary	tones		
for	instance	if	i	were	to	say	here	we	are!’	that	would	be	accepted	without	any	contradiction	and	it	’s	a	nice	sort	of	remark	to	begin	a	conversation	with		
i	asked	that	foreigner	to	take	her	in	because	he	’s	very	musical	too		
when	the	other	professor	had	recited	this	verse	he	went	across	to	the	fireplace	and	put	his	head	up	the	chimney		
who	shall	stop	him		
the	funeral	baked	meats	did	coldly	furnish	forth	the	marriagetables,’	i	could	not	help	repeating	to	myself		
about	a	thousand	and	four	said	bruno		
how	many	axioms	are	you	going	to	give	us		
i	do	n’t	like	owls		
suppose	you	discover	a	remedy	for	some	disease	hitherto	supposed	to	be	incurable		
it	were	too	tiny	he	repeated		
you	need	n’t	be	afraid	of	me		
but	no	man	in	his	senses—	he	looked	sternly	round	the	table	as	if	defying	contradiction	—ever	yet	discussed	wine	with	a	lady	he	sipped	his	glass	of	port	leaned	back	in	his	chair	and	slowly	raised	it	up	to	his	eye	so	as	to	look	through	it	at	the	lamp		
what	they	were	i	could	not	at	all	make	out	but	some	mysterious	change	seemed	instantly	to	pass	over	us		
i	’m	agoan	whoam	what	withouten	thy	drink	willie	man	shouted	the	others		
one	would	cry	i	forgot	to	wind	up	my	heart	this	morning		
bless	me		
no	man	would	ever	do	such	a	thing	put	wednesday	simply	as	the	date		
what	care	we	take	about	feeding	the	lucky	body		
it	looks	pale	and	the	pulse	is	very	slow		
but	the	greater	the	exertion	the	more	valuable	we	may	be	sure	is	the	effect		
and	then	as	to	the	mastication	of	the	food	the	mental	process	answering	to	this	is	simply	thinking	over	what	we	read		
then	again	though	the	food	be	wholesome	and	in	proper	amount	we	know	that	we	must	not	consume	too	many	kinds	at	once		
i	had	to	let	them	stand	over	from	last	week	being	so	busy	and	my	doctor	says	he	will	not	answer	for	the	consequences	if	i	wait	any	longer		
considering	the	amount	of	painful	experience	many	of	us	have	had	in	feeding	and	dosing	the	body	it	would	i	think	be	quite	worth	our	while	to	try	and	translate	some	of	the	rules	into	corresponding	ones	for	the	mind		
take	the	thirsty	a	quart	of	beer	or	a	quart	of	cider	or	even	a	quart	of	cold	tea	and	he	will	probably	thank	you	though	not	so	heartily	in	the	last	case		
you	go	out	three	times	for	wanst	that	you	come	in		
years	ago	i	used	to	receive	letters	from	a	friendand	very	interesting	letters	toowritten	in	one	of	the	most	atrocious	hands	ever	invented		
up	comes	a	handful	of	very	promising	facts	but	on	examination	they	turn	out	to	belong	to	the	wrong	century	and	are	pitched	in	again		
did	you	ever	know	a	circulating	decimal	come	to	an	end	       	rule	5.'if	your	friend	makes	a	severe	remark	either	leave	it	unnoticed	or	make	your	reply	distinctly	less	severe	and	if	he	makes	a	friendly	remark	tending	towards	making	up	the	little	difference	that	has	arisen	between	you	let	your	reply	be	distinctly	more	friendly		
to	think	that	it	has	been	standing	still	for	the	last	three	hours		
which	of	us	does	as	much	for	his	mind		
a	great	deal	of	the	bad	writing	in	the	world	comes	simply	from	writing	too	quickly		
it	is	astonishing	what	an	amount	of	impetus	and	elasticity	the	mind	recovers	during	those	short	periods	of	rest		
you	ca	n't	puzzle	him		
and	when	several	had	been	thus	guessed	the	context	would	help	one	with	the	others	till	at	last	the	whole	series	of	hieroglyphics	was	deciphered		
if	all	one	's	friends	wrote	like	that	life	would	be	entirely	spent	in	reading	their	letters		
is	the	body	so	much	the	more	important	of	the	two		
this	will	often	lead	to	your	writing	it	all	over	again	taking	out	a	lot	of	the	vinegar	and	pepper	and	putting	in	honey	instead	and	thus	making	a	much	more	palatable	dish	of	it		
i	really	think	i	have	met	with	one	or	two	minds	which	could	not	keep	up	with	the	slowest	trot	in	conversation	could	not	jump	over	a	logical	fence	to	save	their	lives	always	got	stuck	fast	in	a	narrow	argument	and	in	short	were	fit	for	nothing	but	to	waddle	helplessly	through	the	world		
if	in	picking	a	quarrel	each	party	declined	to	go	more	than	threeeighths	of	the	way	and	if	in	making	friends	each	was	ready	to	go	fiveeighths	of	the	waywhy	there	would	be	more	reconciliations	than	quarrels		
then	we	should	be	careful	to	provide	this	wholesome	food	in	proper	amount		
and	what	causes	the	difference		
you	ask	him	a	question	say	in	english	history	he	is	understood	to	have	just	finished	reading	macaulay		
why	what	have	you	been	doing	with	this	mind	lately		
meanwhile	every	one	is	waiting	for	his	reply	and	as	the	silence	is	getting	more	and	more	awkward	our	wellread	friend	has	to	stammer	out	some	halfanswer	at	last	not	nearly	so	clear	or	so	satisfactory	as	an	ordinary	schoolboy	would	have	given		
but	what	think	you	his	feelings	would	be	if	you	offered	him	a	tray	containing	a	little	mug	of	beer	a	little	mug	of	cider	another	of	cold	tea	one	of	hot	tea	one	of	coffee	one	of	cocoa	and	corresponding	vessels	of	milk	water	brandyandwater	and	buttermilk		
it	would	fare	but	ill	with	many	of	us	if	we	were	left	to	superintend	our	own	digestion	and	circulation		
i	used	to	carry	it	about	in	my	pocket	and	take	it	out	at	leisure	times	to	puzzle	over	the	riddles	which	composed	itholding	it	in	different	positions	and	at	different	distances	till	at	last	the	meaning	of	some	hopeless	scrawl	would	flash	upon	me	when	i	at	once	wrote	down	the	english	under	it		
take	care	now		
a	second	haul	brings	up	a	fact	much	more	like	the	real	thing	but	unfortunately	along	with	it	comes	a	tangle	of	other	thingsa	fact	in	political	economy	a	rule	in	arithmetic	the	ages	of	his	brother	's	children	and	a	stanza	of	gray	's	elegy	and	among	all	these	the	fact	he	wants	has	got	hopelessly	twisted	up	and	entangled		
this	is	a	very	much	greater	exertion	of	mind	than	the	mere	passive	taking	in	the	contents	of	our	author		
sugarplums		
and	many	a	mind	that	hurries	through	book	after	book	without	waiting	to	digest	or	arrange	anything	gets	into	that	sort	of	condition	and	the	unfortunate	owner	finds	himself	far	from	fit	really	to	support	the	character	all	his	friends	give	him		
to	repeat	your	arguments	all	over	again	will	simply	lead	to	his	doing	the	same	and	so	you	will	go	on	like	a	circulating	decimal		
can	you	doubt	him		
rule	for	correspondence	that	has	unfortunately	become	controversial		
of	course	you	reply	i	do	it	to	save	time		
we	very	soon	learn	what	will	and	what	will	not	agree	with	the	body	and	find	little	difficulty	in	refusing	a	piece	of	the	tempting	pudding	or	pie	which	is	associated	in	our	memory	with	that	terrible	attack	of	indigestion	and	whose	very	name	irresistibly	recalls	rhubarb	and	magnesia	but	it	takes	a	great	many	lessons	to	convince	us	how	indigestible	some	of	our	favourite	lines	of	reading	are	and	again	and	again	we	make	a	meal	of	the	unwholesome	novel	sure	to	be	followed	by	its	usual	train	of	low	spirits	unwillingness	to	work	weariness	of	existencein	fact	by	mental	nightmare		
well	it	is	i	say	for	us	that	the	consequences	of	neglecting	the	body	can	be	clearly	seen	and	felt	and	it	might	be	well	for	some	if	the	mind	were	equally	visible	and	tangibleif	we	could	take	it	say	to	the	doctor	and	have	its	pulse	felt

while	lewis	carroll	was	staying	in	the	house	there	came	to	call	a	certain	genial	and	by	no	means	shy	dean	who	without	realizing	what	he	was	doing	proceeded	in	the	presence	of	other	callers	to	make	some	remark	identifying	mr.	dodgson	as	the	author	of	his	books	there	followed	an	immense	explosion	immediately	on	the	visitor	's	departure	with	a	pathetic	and	serious	request	that	if	there	were	any	risk	of	a	repetition	of	the	call	due	warning	might	be	given	and	the	retreat	secured	probably	not	many	readers	of	the	immortal	alice	have	ever	seen	the	curious	little	whimsical	paper	called	  	eight	or	nine	wise	words	about	letterwriting	which	their	author	had	printed	and	used	to	send	to	his	acquaintance	accompanied	by	a	small	case	for	postagestamps	it	consists	of	forty	pages	and	is	published	by	emberlin	and	son	oxford	and	these	are	the	contents	                                    	page	  	on	stampcases	                     	5	  	how	to	begin	a	letter	              	8	  	how	to	go	on	with	a	letter	        	11	  	how	to	end	a	letter	               	20	  	on	registering	correspondence	     	22	in	this	little	script	also	there	are	the	same	sparkles	of	wit	which	betoken	that	nimble	pen	as	for	example	under	how	to	begin	a	letter	and	never	never	dear	madam	n.b.this	remark	is	addressed	to	ladies	only

it	generally	took	me	about	a	week	to	read	one	of	his	letters

one	hour	of	steady	thinking	over	a	subject	a	solitary	walk	is	as	good	an	opportunity	for	the	process	as	any	other	is	worth	two	or	three	of	reading	only		
so	much	greater	an	exertion	is	it	that	as	coleridge	says	the	mind	often	angrily	refuses	to	put	itself	to	such	troubleso	much	greater	that	we	are	far	too	apt	to	neglect	it	altogether	and	go	on	pouring	in	fresh	food	on	the	top	of	the	undigested	masses	already	lying	there	till	the	unfortunate	mind	is	fairly	swamped	under	the	flood

therefore	nature	provides	that	in	case	of	serious	neglect	of	the	body	such	terrible	consequences	of	discomfort	and	pain	shall	ensue	as	will	soon	bring	us	back	to	a	sense	of	our	duty	and	some	of	the	functions	necessary	to	life	she	does	for	us	altogether	leaving	us	no	choice	in	the	matter

having	settled	the	proper	kind	amount	and	variety	of	our	mental	food	it	remains	that	we	should	be	careful	to	allow	proper	intervals	between	meal	and	meal	and	not	swallow	the	food	hastily	without	mastication	so	that	it	may	be	thoroughly	digested	both	which	rules	for	the	body	are	also	applicable	at	once	to	the	mind		
there	may	be	perhaps	many	others	who	gathering	round	a	winter	fire	will	be	glad	to	read	words	however	few	from	that	bright	source	and	whose	memories	will	respond	to	the	fresh	touch	of	that	cherished	name	it	remains	to	add	but	one	or	two	more	associations	that	cling	to	it	and	make	the	remembrance	more	vivid	still

her	voice	was	very	full	and	rich	   	and	when	at	length	she	asked	him	which	   	it	mounted	to	its	highest	pitch		
such	a	ridiculous	old	chap	         	was	never	seen	before

there	is	no	rest	in	venice	on	   	the	bridge	of	sighs	she	quoted	low	from	byron	and	from	tennyson		
some	desperate	attempts	were	made	to	start	a	conversation	   	madam	the	sportive	brown	essayed	which	kind	of	recreation	   	hunting	or	fishing	have	you	made	your	special	occupation	   	her	lips	curved	downwards	instantly	as	if	of	indiarubber
