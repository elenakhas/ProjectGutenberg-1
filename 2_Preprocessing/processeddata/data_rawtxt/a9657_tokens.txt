that	would	be	a	sensible	thing	to	do

stephen	and	paul	were	hoarse	with	yelling	as	first	one	wicket	then	another	went	down	for	scarcely	a	run

if	he	loman	had	felt	quite	certain	that	he	had	damaged	the	rod	himself	of	course	he	would	not	think	of	such	a	thing	but	he	was	not	at	all	certain	the	thing	was	not	defective	to	begin	with

he	said	in	a	forced	tone	and	manner	utterly	unlike	his	old	self		
stephen	stared	at	his	master	and	the	master	looked	very	pleasantly	at	stephen		
he	was	in	the	cricket	eleven	and	he	was	intellectual	very	very	much	so		
no	said	loman	beginning	to	feel	uncomfortable		
the	guineapigs	and	tadpoles	said	the	dominican	looked	quite	unearthly	in	their	cleanliness		
he	had	come	to	saint	dominic	's	with	a	great	quantity	of	good	resolutions	the	chief	of	which	was	that	he	would	work	hard	and	keep	out	of	mischief	and	it	grieved	him	much	to	find	that	in	neither	aim	was	he	succeeding		
the	fellows	tried	to	make	me	think	i	was	the	real	winner	of	the	nightingale	and	i	was	idiot	enough	half	to	believe	it		
there	was	no	doubt	about	it	he	was	a	hero		
a	charming	afternoon	's	occupation	this	for	a	boy	of	seventeen		
but	the	magic	has	suddenly	gone	out	of	prizeday	and	no	coaxing	can	bring	it	back

the	swift	flood	sweeps	on	and	sucks	under	its	prey	with	fearful	force		
nothing	like	having	an	object	when	you	're	grinding		
i	may	as	well		
things	never	turn	out	at	cricket	as	one	expects	however	and	the	second	innings	of	the	sixth	was	no	exception	to	the	rule		
whatwhatever	does	it	matter	he	said	if	the	fellow	did	take	it		
why	ever	not		
i	'm	not	the	best	or	anything	like	said	oliver	warmly	i	hate	your	saying	soi	wish	almost	i	had	never	told	you	anything	about	it		
the	blow	had	been	a	cowardly	one	and	certainly	unmerited	and	by	all	schoolboy	tradition	one	fairly	demanding	a	return		
i	ca	n't	tell	what	's	in	your	pocket

said	he	with	his	hand	at	his	belt		
only	i	was	glad	he	hinted	that	i	might	presently	come	back	to	see	them		
at	that	he	looked	uneasy	and	said	jack	gedge	was	not	there		
maiden	said	i	have	patience		
that	's	all		
the	captain	quitted	the	hall	at	daybreak	said	i.		
it	smote	me	to	the	heart	to	mark	the	struggle	in	my	comrade	's	face	to	keep	down	the	ravenous	joy	which	for	a	moment	hailed	the	coming	in	of	these	good	things		
here	follow	me	said	i	leading	him	up	the	narrow	stairs	here	is	a	room	where	you	should	be	safe	and	i	put	him	into	the	chamber	that	was	once	the	maiden	's		
i	cried	are	you	gone	mad		
i	could	see	the	waterman	's	boat	behind	me	come	through	the	bridge	and	guessed	well	enough	that	some	other	craft	near	it	were	joining	in	the	pursuit		
ludar	told	me	what	he	never	told	the	don	that	he	had	been	captured	as	he	returned	in	the	cockboat	by	a	boat	of	the	enemy	's	belonging	to	the	ship	revenge		
tis	a	custom	with	us	said	she	for	the	chiefs	to	take	wives	who	are	theirs	only	so	long	as	a	better	does	not	present	herself		
then	there	was	great	joy	on	board	the	rata		
chapter	twelve		
ludar	heard	the	soldier	first		
he	flung	his	senseless	burden	to	the	ground	with	a	curse	and	was	turning	to	the	horse	when	i	stepped	out	sword	in	hand	and	faced	him		
after	much	ado	i	was	admitted	to	see	master	walgrave	in	the	white	lion		
i	dreamed	all	night	that	ludar	was	calling	to	me	to	turn	back	while	the	maiden	was	bidding	me	go	forward	and	betwixt	them	i	was	torn	in	two	and	lay	kicking	all	night	listening	to	the	clatter	of	hoofs	that	went	past	and	fancying	that	while	i	tarried	there	his	grace	of	canterbury	was	carrying	off	my	sweet	jeannette	i	know	not	whither		
are	you	alone		
a	voice	from	above	restored	me	to	life		
said	he	and	speak	not	to	me	unless	it	be	to	say	dinner	is	served		
i	said	sir	john	pulling	himself	up	as	representing	her	gracious	majesty	here	sorley	boy	stalked	off	to	where	a	miniature	picture	of	her	majesty	hung	on	the	wall		
when	about	midnight	halfstifled	with	the	heat	we	came	on	deck	the	rata	was	running	before	the	wind	at	the	rear	of	the	armada	heading	for	the	french	coast	and	the	lanthorns	of	the	english	had	dropped	a	league	behind		
but	as	for	me	men	looked	once	twice	and	thrice	at	me	before	they	would	believe	it	was	humphrey	dexter		
then	he	held	out	his	great	hand	and	she	lay	her	little	hand	in	it	and	her	true	eyes	flashed	up	to	meet	his		
how	i	followed	him	twould	be	hard	to	say		
i	fear	we	shall	none	of	us	get	more	than	will	whet	our	appetite		
fortune	favoured	us	that	day	as	she	had	handled	us	roughly	in	the	days	before		
wait	till	then		
there	is	sore	distress	in	their	camp	and	i	durst	not	put	in	my	head		
come	away	with	them	to	the	city		
he	had	not	gone	twenty	yards	from	me	when	there	was	a	great	shout	and	clatter	of	horsemen	and	before	i	well	knew	what	had	happened	i	saw	sir	ludar	disarmed	in	the	clutches	of	half	a	dozen	men		
we	being	mounted	distanced	most	of	them		
the	plot	we	heard	was	a	devilish	one	to	murder	the	queen	and	her	ministers	and	give	england	up	to	the	heretic	spaniard		
presently	ludar	came	up	to	where	we	stood		
twas	a	wild	weird	scenethose	hundreds	of	citizens	lit	up	by	the	fierce	glare	of	the	bonfires	whose	roar	mingled	with	the	shoutings	and	whose	heat	was	less	than	the	loyal	fires	which	blazed	in	our	bosoms		
it	was	vain	i	knew	to	attempt	to	learn	more	from	the	sleepy	caretaker	at	least	till	morning	nor	was	there	anyone	else	that	i	knew	of	from	whom	i	could	get	satisfaction		
some	of	his	masters	he	had	defied	others	he	had	scorned	one	he	had	nearly	slain		
he	tore	it	open	and	read	it	eagerly	and	as	he	did	so	his	face	relaxed	into	a	grim	smile		
would	that	i	could	show	him	to	you	as	he	stood	there	his	face	ablaze	with	triumph	yet	almost	humbled	with	his	good	fortune		
to	that	there	was	no	access	save	by	the	small	ladder	which	i	accordingly	wrenched	from	its	place	and	swung	round	with	all	my	might	at	my	assailants		
i	know	not	why	i	grudged	to	see	him	go	in		
little	you	know	master	prentice		
then	i	perceived	suddenly	on	our	right	a	twinkle	of	light	which	presently	increased	to	a	lurid	flame		
i	was	that	boy		
how	we	brought	the	maiden	to	her	father	's	house		
so	i	kept	steadily	on	scarcely	holding	my	own	with	my	pursuers	until	at	length	to	my	joy	i	saw	her	put	about	and	bear	down	full	upon	me		
in	the	danger	of	last	night	his	face	had	been	troubled	and	his	manner	excited		
nay	said	i	tis	no	place	for	you	maiden		
i	know	not	said	the	maiden	but	i	saw	one	sailor	an	hour	ago	catch	three		
at	first	it	seemed	in	this	cockleshell	we	were	little	better	off	than	clinging	to	the	spar	for	every	wave	threatened	to	swamp	it		
so	near	was	it	i	wondered	whether	it	might	not	be	the	lighting	of	a	match	at	our	own	guns		
my	arm	hangs	feeble	at	my	side		
humphrey	said	ludar	if	it	be	any	comfort	to	you	i	like	not	these	dons		
from	where	we	stood	we	could	see	but	little	of	the	fight	except	that	within	a	few	yards	of	the	enemy	alexander	halted	his	men	and	then	stepping	forward	sword	in	hand	boldly	dared	the	english	leader	whoever	he	might	be	to	single	combat		
your	master	is	too	busy	a	man	one	press	was	not	enough	for	him	nor	one	libel		
lucky	for	us	the	woods	on	either	bank	were	too	dense	to	allow	them	to	get	within	shot	of	us		
as	i	stood	craning	my	neck	forward	gazing	under	my	hands	seaward	there	crowded	into	my	memory	visions	of	all	my	past	life		
there	too	was	the	great	cathedral	with	its	crowd	of	loungers	and	fleet	street	full	of	swaggering	prentices	and	the	river	sparkling	in	the	sun		
alas		
can	it	be	true		
tis	as	well	this	journey	of	yours	failed	said	she		
when	do	you	start		
our	captain	brave	man	as	he	was	lost	courage	when	he	found	the	water	coming	higher	in	the	hold	and	saw	the	misericorde	labour	harder	with	every	new	wave	and	ship	more	water	each	time	than	the	last		
i	had	no	mind	to	put	myself	again	within	reach	of	his	worship	the	mayor	of	oxford	and	his	merry	men	so	i	tugged	my	right	rein	and	kept	my	horse	's	head	turned	to	the	wooded	hills	northward		
tis	said	twas	some	spirit		
flung	a	stone	my	way	and	would	have	followed	it	up	had	not	peter	taken	his	arm	and	forcibly	held	him	back		
when	he	discovered	that	the	maidenhis	once	mistress	and	incomparable	swanwas	of	our	household	he	fell	into	strange	raptures	concerning	the	indulgences	of	the	gods	towards	their	favouritesmeaning	himself		
said	i.		
afterwards	he	told	me	that	he	found	her	there	half	stunned	by	the	wind	but	never	flinching	or	yielding	a	point	out	of	the	course		
but	they	would	not	hear	of	that	and	for	fear	of	betraying	myself	i	forbore	to	press	it	and	went	betimes	to	bed	promising	to	be	away	before	daybreak	on	the	morrow		
and	the	captain	was	very	glad	of	the	aid	for	it	was	all	the	crew	could	do	to	keep	the	misericorde	taut	and	straight	in	her	course		
little	trouble	to	you	to	send	us	from	one	cruel	fate	to	a	worse		
the	inn	where	i	had	lain	was	at	the	river	's	bank	and	yet	no	road	seemed	to	lead	to	it	or	from	it
