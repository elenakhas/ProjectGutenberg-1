soaring	with	strenuous	flight	above	 	he	bears	her	to	the	blessed	grove	 	where	in	his	ancient	and	august	abodes	 	there	dwells	old	casyapa	the	sire	of	gods		
some	of	the	yogees	who	smear	themselves	with	ashes	use	none	but	what	they	collect	from	funeral	piles	human	ashes		
on	whom	his	parents	gaze	 	till	they	shed	tears	of	joy	and	tenderness		
they	feel	the	crumbling	bank	give	way	 	and	all	are	plunged	into	the	stream		
		
after	they	had	thus	penetrated	the	east	quarter	they	opened	their	way	to	the	south		
		
for	a	hundred	years	more	he	lived	upon	nothing	but	air		
dellon	also	whom	i	consider	as	one	of	the	best	travellers	in	the	east	expressly	asserts	that	widows	are	burnt	there	de	gré	ou	de	force		
thus	far	the	thirtysecond	section	describing	the	digging	of	earth		
from	rock	to	rock	with	shivering	force	rebounding	 	the	mighty	cataract	rushes	heaven	around	 	likethunder	with	the	incessant	roar	resounding	 	and	meru	's	summit	shaking	with	the	sound		
the	surf	was	so	high	that	many	others	put	back		
this	he	said	might	at	first	sight	appear	an	enormous	sum	for	the	state	to	pay	but	the	average	life	of	seamen	is	from	hard	service	finished	at	fortyfive		
owing	probably	to	these	prejudices	and	the	influence	of	the	peculators	he	was	treated	on	his	return	to	england	in	a	manner	which	had	nearly	driven	him	from	the	service		
conceiving	that	when	an	officer	is	not	successful	in	his	plans	it	is	absolutely	necessary	that	he	should	explain	the	motives	upon	which	they	were	founded	nelson	wrote	at	this	time	an	account	and	vindication	of	his	conduct	for	having	carried	the	fleet	to	egypt		
nelson	was	not	deceived	in	his	judgment	of	the	danish	cabinet	but	the	battle	of	copenhagen	had	crippled	its	power		
to	write	letters	to	you	says	he	is	the	next	greatest	pleasure	i	feel	to	receiving	them	from	you		
mr.	udney	our	consul	at	leghorn	was	the	first	person	who	procured	certain	intelligence	of	the	enemy	's	design	against	malta	and	from	his	own	sagacity	foresaw	that	egypt	must	be	their	after	object		
lord	nelson	with	humble	duty	to	his	royal	highness	the	prince	will	consider	this	the	greatest	victory	he	has	ever	gained	if	it	may	be	the	cause	of	a	happy	reconciliation	and	union	between	his	own	most	gracious	sovereign	and	his	majesty	the	king	of	denmark		
he	showed	a	proper	sense	of	respect	for	nelson	's	services	and	of	confidence	in	his	talents	by	taking	care	not	to	bring	with	him	any	older	captain		
januarius		
for	eighteen	hours	his	life	was	despaired	of	and	even	when	the	disorder	took	a	favourable	turn	and	he	was	so	far	recovered	as	again	to	appear	on	deck	he	himself	thought	that	his	end	was	approachingsuch	was	the	weakness	to	which	the	fever	and	cough	had	reduced	him		
on	his	way	he	fell	in	with	two	spanish	frigates	the	sabina	and	the	ceres		
collingwood	ranged	up	and	hauling	up	his	mainsail	just	astern	passed	within	ten	feet	of	the	san	nicolas	giving	her	a	most	tremendous	fire	then	passed	on	for	the	santissima	trinidad		
but	the	answer	which	he	received	from	government	quieted	his	fears	it	stated	that	captain	nelson	was	a	very	good	officer	and	needed	to	be	under	no	apprehension	for	he	would	assuredly	be	supported		
in	consequence	if	is	said	these	very	extensive	public	frauds	were	at	length	put	in	a	proper	train	to	be	provided	against	in	future	his	representations	were	attended	to	and	every	step	which	he	recommended	was	adopted	the	investigation	was	put	into	a	proper	course	which	ended	in	the	detection	and	punishment	of	some	of	the	culprits	an	immense	saving	was	made	to	government	and	thus	its	attention	was	directed	to	similar	peculations	in	other	arts	of	the	colonies		
the	governments	of	naples	and	sicily	either	knew	not	or	chose	to	keep	me	in	ignorance		
lady	hamilton	like	a	heroine	of	modern	romance	explored	with	no	little	danger	a	subterraneous	passage	leading	from	the	palace	to	the	seaside	through	this	passage	the	royal	treasures	the	choicest	pieces	of	painting	and	sculpture	and	other	property	to	the	amount	of	two	millions	and	a	half	were	conveyed	to	the	shore	and	stowed	safely	on	board	the	english	ships		
but	long	it	can	not	shall	not	be		
sir	richard	's	first	feeling	was	that	of	anger	and	he	was	about	to	supersede	nelson	but	having	mentioned	the	affair	to	his	captain	that	officer	told	him	he	believed	all	the	squadron	thought	the	orders	illegal	and	therefore	did	not	know	how	far	they	were	bound	to	obey	them		
this	battle	or	to	speak	more	correctly	this	total	defeat	of	the	regicide	squadron	was	obtained	by	the	valour	of	this	brave	admiral	seconded	by	a	navy	which	is	the	terror	of	its	enemies		
all	i	write	to	you	is	known	at	the	queen	's		
the	neapolitan	revolutionists	thought	that	without	a	total	change	of	system	any	relief	from	the	present	evils	was	impossible	and	they	believed	themselves	justified	in	bringing	about	that	change	by	any	means		
the	whole	of	the	seacoast	of	italy	saved	and	this	is	owing	alone	to	the	generous	english		
sir	john	orde	necessarily	retired	at	his	approach		
the	three	northern	courts	had	formed	a	confederacy	for	making	england	resign	her	naval	rights		
it	is	true	our	opponents	were	in	hulks	and	floats	only	adapted	for	the	position	they	were	in	but	that	made	our	battle	so	much	the	harder	and	victory	so	much	the	more	difficult	to	obtain		
notice	was	then	immediately	given	to	the	british	merchants	that	they	would	be	received	on	board	any	ships	in	the	squadron		
before	any	government	can	be	overthrown	by	the	consent	of	the	people	the	government	must	be	intolerably	oppressive	or	the	people	thoroughly	corrupted		
when	i	leave	your	command	i	become	dead	to	the	world'i	go	hence	and	am	no	more	seen		
the	desiree	frigate	also	at	the	other	end	of	the	line	having	gone	toward	the	close	of	the	action	to	assist	the	bellona	became	fast	on	the	same	shoal		
for	a	long	time	the	amazon	had	been	firing	enveloped	in	smoke	when	riou	desired	his	men	to	stand	fast	and	let	the	smoke	clear	off	that	they	might	see	what	they	were	about		
encouraged	by	the	conduct	of	lord	howe	and	by	his	reception	at	court	nelson	renewed	his	attack	upon	the	peculators	with	fresh	spirit		
some	were	picked	up	by	our	boats	and	some	even	in	the	heat	and	fury	of	the	action	were	dragged	into	the	lower	ports	of	the	nearest	british	ships	by	the	british	sailors		
the	king	returned	to	naples	where	every	day	brought	with	it	tidings	of	some	new	disgrace	from	the	army	and	the	discovery	of	some	new	treachery	at	home	till	four	days	after	his	return	the	general	sent	him	advice	that	there	was	no	prospect	of	stopping	the	progress	of	the	enemy	and	that	the	royal	family	must	look	to	their	own	personal	safety		
it	is	said	that	the	king	when	he	granted	him	this	permission	warned	him	not	to	take	any	part	in	politics	expressing	at	the	same	time	his	own	persuasion	that	he	should	recover	his	kingdom		
i	beg	that	his	hair	may	be	cut	off	and	given	me	it	shall	be	buried	in	my	grave		
i	believe	this	illluck	will	go	near	to	kill	me	but	as	these	are	times	for	exertion	i	must	not	be	cast	down	whatever	i	may	feel		
accordingly	he	informed	the	treasury	that	if	a	satisfactory	answer	were	not	sent	him	by	return	of	post	he	should	take	refuge	in	france		
after	an	action	of	three	hours	during	which	the	spaniards	lost	164	men	the	sabina	struck		
and	lord	nelson	will	take	his	prisoners	out	of	the	vessels	and	burn	or	carry	off	his	prizes	as	he	shall	think	fit		
the	french	were	better	politicians		
if	sir	hyde	were	gone	i	would	now	be	under	sail		
after	pointing	out	and	detecting	some	of	the	misstatements	in	the	account	he	proceeds	as	to	his	nonsense	about	victory	his	royal	highness	will	not	much	credit	him		
the	fleet	having	anchored	nelson	with	riou	in	the	amazon	made	his	last	examination	of	the	ground	and	about	one	o'clock	returning	to	his	own	ship	threw	out	the	signal	to	weigh		
nisbet	took	one	of	the	oars	and	ordered	the	steersman	to	go	close	under	the	guns	of	the	battery	that	they	might	be	safe	from	its	tremendous	fire		
but	there	was	in	this	book	a	scrap	of	dirty	paper	filled	with	figures		
at	the	commencement	of	the	last	century	they	quelled	one	revolt	by	the	aid	of	german	auxiliaries	whom	the	emperor	charles	vi		
this	drew	on	the	defeat	of	the	austrians		
if	not	a	short	time	will	decide	the	business		
it	is	an	old	saying	said	he	in	his	letter	that	the	devil	's	children	have	the	devil	's	luck		
she	was	more	than	any	other	lineofbattle	ship	exposed	to	the	great	battery	and	supporting	at	the	same	time	the	united	fire	of	the	holstein	and	the	zealand	her	loss	this	day	exceeded	that	of	any	single	ship	during	the	whole	war		
a	miserable	sight	for	the	french	who	with	all	their	skill	and	all	their	courage	and	all	their	advantages	of	numbers	and	situation	were	upon	that	element	on	which	when	the	hour	of	trial	comes	a	frenchman	has	no	hope		
the	english	ships	were	all	seventyfours	the	french	had	three	eightygun	ships	and	one	threedecker	of	one	hundred	and	twenty		
and	under	what	circumstances	and	with	what	pointed	aggravation		
for	the	battle	of	copenhagen	nelson	was	raised	to	the	rank	of	viscountan	inadequate	mark	of	reward	for	services	so	splendid	and	of	such	paramount	importance	to	the	dearest	interests	of	england		
after	mature	consideration	he	said	in	a	letter	to	lord	hood	and	a	personal	inspection	for	several	days	of	all	circumstances	local	as	well	as	others	i	consider	the	siege	of	bastia	with	our	present	means	and	force	to	be	a	most	visionary	and	rash	attempt	such	as	no	officer	would	be	justified	in	undertaking		
from	the	21st	of	january	the	fleet	had	remained	ready	for	battle	without	a	bulkhead	up	night	or	day		
in	a	few	minutes	every	man	stationed	at	the	first	six	guns	in	the	fore	part	of	the	vanguard	's	deck	was	killed	or	wounded		
the	committee	then	finding	that	they	had	to	deal	with	a	man	who	knew	his	own	power	and	was	determined	to	make	the	british	name	respected	desisted	from	the	insolent	conduct	which	they	had	assumed	and	it	was	acknowledged	that	bastia	never	had	been	so	quiet	and	orderly	since	the	english	were	in	possession	of	it		
so	rapid	was	the	conflagration	that	the	french	in	their	official	account	say	the	hull	the	masts	and	sails	all	seemed	to	take	fire	at	the	same	moment	and	though	the	english	boats	were	put	out	to	the	assistance	of	the	poor	wretches	on	board	not	more	than	200	could	be	saved		
he	sent	on	shore	to	say	that	he	came	with	friendly	views	and	was	ready	to	return	a	salute		
as	to	politics	said	he	at	this	time	they	are	my	abomination	the	ministers	of	kings	and	princes	are	as	great	scoundrels	as	ever	lived		
on	the	25th	the	youngest	of	the	princes	was	taken	ill	and	died	in	lady	hamilton	's	arms		
many	happy	returns	of	the	day	to	you(it	was	the	first	of	the	new	year)i	never	spent	so	miserable	a	one		
after	the	battle	of	cape	st.	vincent	he	felt	a	little	rest	to	be	so	essential	to	his	recovery	that	he	declared	he	would	not	continue	to	serve	longer	than	the	ensuing	summer	unless	it	should	be	absolutely	necessary	for	in	his	own	strong	language	he	had	then	been	four	years	and	nine	months	without	one	moment	's	repose	for	body	or	mind		
twelve	were	sent	and	nelson	saying	that	he	hoped	yet	to	win	halfadozen	more	great	victories	promised	to	lay	by	six	bottles	of	his	hamburgh	friend	's	wine	for	the	purpose	of	drinking	one	after	each		
upon	this	he	wrote	to	the	secretary	at	war	briefly	stating	what	his	services	on	shore	had	been	and	saying	he	trusted	it	was	not	asking	an	improper	thing	to	request	that	the	same	allowance	might	be	made	to	him	which	would	be	made	to	a	land	officer	of	his	rank	which	situated	as	he	was	would	be	that	of	a	brigadiergeneral	if	this	could	not	be	accorded	he	hoped	that	his	additional	expenses	would	be	paid	him		
troubridge	then	proceeded	to	capua	and	took	the	command	of	the	motley	besieging	force		
i	do	assure	your	lordship	said	he	in	his	answer	to	the	lord	mayor	that	there	is	not	that	man	breathing	who	sets	a	higher	value	upon	the	thanks	of	his	fellowcitizens	of	london	than	myself	but	i	should	feel	as	much	ashamed	to	receive	them	for	a	particular	service	marked	in	the	resolution	if	i	felt	that	i	did	not	come	within	that	line	of	service	as	i	should	feel	hurt	at	having	a	great	victory	passed	over	without	notice		
a	wine	merchant	at	hamburgh	who	was	above	seventy	years	of	age	requested	to	speak	with	lady	hamilton	and	told	her	he	had	some	rhenish	wine	of	the	vintage	of	1625	which	had	been	in	his	own	possession	more	than	halfacentury	he	had	preserved	it	for	some	extraordinary	occasion	and	that	which	had	now	arrived	was	far	beyond	any	that	he	could	ever	have	expected		
upon	this	the	very	sentinels	scampered	off	and	every	vessel	came	out	of	the	mole		
bonfires	and	illuminations	concluded	the	day	and	on	the	morrow	the	volunteer	cavalry	drew	up	and	saluted	him	as	he	departed	and	followed	the	carriage	to	the	borders	of	the	county		
we	shall	have	our	seafriends	and	i	know	sir	william	thinks	they	are	the	best		
alexander	's	ministers	in	their	reply	expressed	their	surprise	at	the	arrival	of	a	british	fleet	in	a	russian	port	and	their	wish	that	it	should	return	they	professed	on	the	part	of	russia	the	most	friendly	disposition	towards	great	britain	but	declined	the	personal	visit	of	lord	nelson	unless	he	came	in	a	single	ship		
the	loss	of	the	danes	including	prisoners	amounted	to	about	six	thousand		
a	few	rounds	were	returned	from	some	of	our	leading	ships	till	they	perceived	its	inutility	this	however	occasioned	the	only	bloodshed	of	the	day	some	of	our	men	being	killed	and	wounded	by	the	bursting	of	a	gun		
had	a	stronger	squadron	been	sent	this	deplorable	catastrophe	might	have	been	spared	a	catastrophe	which	excited	not	more	indignation	in	spain	than	it	did	grief	in	those	who	were	its	unwilling	instruments	in	the	english	government	and	in	the	english	people		
the	frigates	accordingly	landed	their	men	and	nelson	stood	in	with	the	lineofbattle	ships	meaning	to	batter	the	fort	for	the	purpose	of	distracting	the	attention	of	the	garrison		
the	country	he	said	had	attached	a	confidence	to	his	name	which	he	had	submitted	to	and	therefore	had	cheerfully	repaired	to	the	station	but	this	boat	business	though	it	might	be	part	of	a	great	plan	of	invasion	could	never	be	the	only	one	and	he	did	not	think	it	was	a	command	for	a	viceadmiral		
why	to	leave	off	action		
this	was	no	ways	imputable	to	the	admiral	for	he	sent	home	to	government	nelson	's	journal	of	the	siege	that	they	might	fully	understand	the	nature	of	his	indefatigable	and	unequalled	exertions		
the	answer	which	he	received	seemed	to	imply	that	the	old	forms	were	thought	sufficient	and	thus	having	no	alternative	he	was	compelled	with	his	eyes	open	to	submit	to	a	practice	originating	in	fraudulent	intentions		
well	said	he	as	he	left	the	elephant	i	have	fought	contrary	to	orders	and	i	shall	perhaps	be	hanged
