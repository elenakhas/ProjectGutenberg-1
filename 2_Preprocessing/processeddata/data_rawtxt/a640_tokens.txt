upon	the	young	man	’s	information	ojeda	instituted	an	inquiry	and	six	judaizers	were	arrested		
the	accused	would	be	taking	unnecessary	trouble		
if	he	persists	in	his	denials	he	is	to	be	shown	further	implements	of	torture	and	assured	that	he	will	have	to	undergo	them	all	unless	he	speaks	the	truth		
95	even	so	however	it	could	not	be	in	the	interests	of	the	church	to	parade	these	offenders	and	thus	expose	the	sore	places	in	her	own	body		
he	enriched	theological	literature	by	several	works	the	best	known	of	which	is	his	meditations	fr

an	asiatic	says	voltaire	arriving	in	madrid	on	the	day	of	an	auto	de	fé	would	doubt	whether	here	was	a	festival	a	religious	celebration	a	sacrifice	or	a	massacre		
the	opinion	of	the	rabbis	is	that	since	the	king	of	spain	attempts	to	make	you	christians	you	should	become	christians	since	he	deprives	you	of	your	goods	and	property	you	should	make	your	children	merchants	that	they	may	deprive	the	christians	of	theirs	since	you	say	that	they	deprive	you	of	your	lives	make	your	sons	apothecaries	and	physicians	to	deprive	the	christians	of	theirs	since	they	destroy	your	synagogues	make	your	sons	clerics	that	they	may	destroy	the	christian	temples	since	you	say	that	you	suffer	other	wrongs	make	your	sons	enter	public	offices	that	thus	they	may	render	the	christians	subject	to	them		
there	was	an	outcry	from	the	swindled	victims		
and	so	it	continued		
he	resists	their	questions	and	will	add	nothing	to	what	he	has	confessed	until	the	executioner	has	submitted	him	to	that	frightful	torment	and	given	him	one	jar	of	water		
and	in	the	meantime	practice	having	brought	to	light	certain	shortcomings	in	the	decrees	which	he	had	already	issued	torquemada	added	a	further	eleven	articles	in	1485		
moreover	he	was	now	supported	by	fr		
by	that	article	it	was	decreed	that	confiscation	should	be	retrospectivei.e	that	a	heretic	’s	property	should	be	confiscate	not	from	the	day	of	the	discovery	of	his	heresy	but	from	the	date	of	the	offence	itself		
on	the	subject	of	article	viii	which	enjoins	inquisitors	to	punish	false	witnesses	with	public	pains	llorente	is	particularly	interesting	in	a	commentary	properly	to	understand	this	article	it	is	necessary	to	realize	that	there	were	two	ways	of	being	a	false	witness	one	by	calumniating	another	by	denying	knowledge	of	heretical	words	or	deeds	upon	which	a	person	might	be	questioned	in	the	course	of	proceedings	against	an	accused		
about	the	pillars	of	the	vast	church	in	the	gloom	that	was	scarcely	relieved	by	the	altarlamp	they	waited	silently	like	bloody	wolves	says	trasmiera	for	the	coming	of	that	gentle	lamb	towards	midnight	there	was	a	stir	overhead	lights	beat	faintly	upon	the	darkness	the	canons	were	assembling	for	matins	in	the	choir		
obviously	he	was	no	selfseeker		
the	question	may	certainly	seem	an	odd	one	from	a	man	who	had	been	born	a	jew		
hear	him	these	two	divergent	opinions	may	be	reconciled	by	considering	that	whatever	promises	the	inquisitors	make	they	are	not	to	be	understood	to	apply	to	anything	beyond	the	penalties	whose	rigour	the	inquisition	has	the	right	to	lessennamely	canonical	penances	and	not	those	by	law	prescribed	       	he	writes	this	knowing	that	these	promises	are	understood	by	the	prisoner	to	mean	something	very	differentthat	the	prisoner	is	desired	so	to	understand	them	made	so	to	understand	them		
chapter	xix	the	legend	of	the	santo	niño	the	extravagant	story	related	by	martinez	moreno	the	parish	priest	of	la	guardia	in	his	little	book	on	the	santo	niño	is	derived	as	we	have	said	partly	from	the	testimonio	and	partly	from	the	memoria	by	de	vegas	further	it	embodies	all	those	legendary	supernatural	details	with	which	the	popular	imagination	had	embellished	the	theme		
from	this	it	is	to	be	inferred	that	appeals	to	the	vatican	continued	to	be	numerous	notwithstanding	the	provisions	made	by	the	pope	to	constitute	torquemada	the	supreme	arbiter	in	matters	of	the	faith		
his	petition	was	dismissed	the	grand	inquisitor	refusing	to	alter	the	sentence	and	llorente	adds	that	the	capuchin	died	three	years	later	in	the	convent	to	which	he	was	sent		
to	carry	out	this	urgentlyrequired	purification	he	implored	the	queen	to	establish	the	inquisition

whence	was	the	child	they	ask	him		
he	was	tortured	further	in	the	endeavour	to	wring	from	him	the	names	of	his	associates	in	the	deed	and	finally	he	was	promised	grace	if	he	would	divulge	them		
torture	must	not	be	repeated	because	it	is	by	law	forbidden	to	put	an	accused	to	the	question	more	than	once	unless	in	the	meantime	fresh	evidence	has	been	forthcoming	but	it	is	not	forbidden	to	continue	itnot	forbidden	because	those	who	formulated	that	law	never	dreamt	of	such	a	quibble	being	raised		
the	catholic	sovereigns	refused	to	ratify	the	appointment	of	riario	and	begged	the	popesubmissively	at	firstto	cancel	it		
he	introduced	himself	to	the	lad	as	a	rabbi	named	abraham	and	completely	imposed	upon	him	and	won	his	confidence		
surrounded	as	she	was	by	priestly	counsellors	whom	she	respected	she	nevertheless	manifested	plainly	her	impatience	of	the	clerical	usurpation	of	the	rights	of	the	crown		
a	relapsed	heretic	once	his	guilt	was	thoroughly	established	must	be	abandoned	to	the	secular	arm	and	this	notwithstanding	any	repentance	he	might	manifest	or	any	promises	he	might	make	for	the	future		
this	assumption	is	one	that	deepens	the	mysterious	parts	of	the	affair	rather	than	elucidates	them	for	it	leaves	us	without	the	faintest	indication	of	how	the	fiscal	guevára	was	able	to	incorporate	in	his	indictment	nine	months	ago	the	particulars	of	enchantments	with	the	said	host	and	heart	of	a	christian	boy	from	what	benito	has	said	to	yucé	in	prison	we	might	be	justified	in	supposing	that	the	former	is	the	delator	but	in	view	of	the	turn	now	taken	by	the	proceedings	this	supposition	seems	to	become	untenable		
the	populace	surged	into	the	courtyard	clamouring	for	the	seneschal		
in	the	middle	of	the	thirteenth	century	a	change	unfortunately	set	in	and	this	external	harmony	so	laboriously	established	was	disturbed	by	an	excrescence	of	the	real	feelings	that	had	never	ceased	to	underlie	it		
there	they	were	attached	to	the	stakes	that	had	been	erected	fire	was	set	to	the	faggots	and	thus	they	perished	miserably	to	the	greater	honour	and	glory	of	the	catholic	apostolic	church		
trasmiera	diego	garcia	de	epitome	de	la	vida	de	pedro	de	    	arbués	madrid	1664		
there	is	nothing	in	this	article	that	may	be	considered	as	a	departure	from	or	an	enlargement	upon	any	of	the	rules	laid	down	by	eymeric	in	his	directorium	as	we	shall	see	when	we	come	to	deal	with	this	gruesome	subject	of	torture		
    	testimonio	quoted	276	    	paternity	of	329	    	why	crucified	337	    	evidence	considered	346	et	seq		
since	he	had	not	made	an	open	and	complete	confession	it	was	argued	that	he	was	clearly	an	impenitent	heretic	for	whom	there	could	be	no	mercyor	only	a	very	slight	one	as	we	shall	see		
it	became	necessary	for	the	aljama	of	that	city	to	petition	the	sovereigns	for	protection	and	m.	fidel	fita	quotes	a	royal	letter	commanding	such	protection	to	be	extended	with	threats	of	rigour	against	any	who	should	molest	them		
he	invests	the	fanatical	ojeda	with	the	character	of	an	angel	of	mercy	and	represents	him	hovering	round	the	condemned	exhorting	them	almost	with	tears	to	abjure	their	error	and	he	assures	us	that	although	the	dominican	persevered	in	his	charitable	efforts	up	to	the	last	moment	all	was	vain		
the	inquisitors	earnestly	implored	the	secular	justiciaries	to	whom	they	abandoned	him	not	to	do	him	any	hurt	whatever		
if	he	enters	into	such	a	promise	is	he	not	obliged	to	keep	it	by	this	latter	question	he	means	of	course	the	promise	to	pardon	which	the	prisoner	was	given	to	understand	was	made	him		
at	the	conclusion	of	his	announcement	the	gospels	and	a	crucifix	were	brought	and	upon	these	all	were	required	to	make	solemn	oath	of	their	desire	to	serve	god	and	the	sovereigns	to	uphold	the	catholic	faith	and	to	defend	and	shelter	the	administrators	of	the	holy	inquisition		
at	the	first	audience	his	statement	of	yesterday	is	read	over	to	him	and	when	he	has	ratified	it	he	is	again	pressed	with	stealthy	questions	to	add	a	little	more	of	what	passed	in	those	conversations	with	benito		
zurita	geronimo	anales	de	la	corona	de	aragon	madrid	1852		
at	what	period	the	jews	first	appeared	in	the	peninsula	it	is	not	easy	to	determine	with	accuracy		
llorente	tells	us	that	although	he	went	through	very	many	records	of	old	proceedings	of	the	inquisition	in	no	single	instance	did	he	discover	a	record	of	any	such	provision	in	favour	of	the	child	of	a	condemned	heretic		
173	the	matter	was	of	such	gravity	that	we	are	quite	safe	in	assumingand	we	have	evidence	to	warrant	the	assumptionthat	it	was	instantly	communicated	to	torquemada	who	at	the	time	was	at	his	convent	of	segovia	practically	upon	the	spot		
in	no	catholic	country	does	the	cherishing	of	a	fervent	faith	in	itself	imply	respect	for	the	clergy		
failing	that	he	begs	them	to	declare	his	client	acquitted	to	release	him	restoring	him	his	good	fame	and	all	property	that	may	have	been	confiscated	by	order	of	their	paternities	or	any	other	judges	of	the	inquisition		
torquemada	’s	frenzied	intolerance	of	men	of	jewish	blood	was	by	no	means	confined	to	those	who	practised	the	law	of	moses		
these	men	who	were	secretly	armed	having	gained	admission	stabbed	the	sentry	and	seized	the	person	of	bobadilla	whilst	maldonado	with	other	of	his	people	took	possession	of	the	castle	itself		
whilst	on	the	subject	it	may	be	added	that	the	crucifix	as	the	emblem	of	christianity	was	not	introduced	until	the	seventh	century	when	it	was	established	by	the	quinisexte	council	at	constantinople		
p.	8		
he	has	left	us	a	rather	intimate	history	of	the	catholic	sovereigns	fairly	rich	in	vivid	detail		
192	it	certainly	seems	that	without	previous	assurance	that	some	such	consideration	was	intended	towards	him	he	would	never	have	ventured	to	prefer	a	request	of	this	nature	at	once	incriminatingsince	it	admitted	his	possession	of	knowledge	hitherto	withheldand	impudent	in	its	assumption	that	such	information	would	be	purchased	at	the	price	he	named		
a	person	was	considered	relapsusrelapsed	into	heresynot	only	if	as	in	the	case	of	the	selfdelator	who	availed	himself	of	the	edict	of	grace	he	had	once	been	pardoned	an	avowed	heresy	but	if	he	had	once	abjured	a	heresy	of	which	he	had	been	suspected	either	vehemently	or	violently		
under	it	he	gives	a	general	confirmation	of	what	has	already	been	extracted	from	the	others		
succour	them	none	dared	by	virtue	of	the	decree	of	the	grand	inquisitor	but	on	every	hand	they	were	exhorted	to	accept	baptism	and	thus	set	a	term	upon	their	tribulations		
80	llorente	says	of	him	the	result	accredited	the	election		
but	eymeric	went	no	further	than	to	say	that	these	names	should	be	suppressed	where	a	possibility	of	danger	to	the	delators	lay	in	their	being	divulged		
presuming	upon	his	high	position	and	also	upon	the	great	esteem	in	which	he	was	held	by	his	king	caballeria	showed	the	inquisition	an	intrepid	countenance		
a	word	must	here	be	said	on	the	score	of	abjuration		
he	had	collected	the	various	elements	of	the	peninsula	into	one	mighty	kingdom	which	he	had	subjected	to	their	sceptre		
rather	was	torquemada	’s	object	to	remove	all	fear	that	might	trammel	delators	and	stifle	delations		
but	in	such	cases	the	inquisitors	should	proceed	with	    	great	care	in	their	examination	of	the	witnesses	closely	    	crossquestioning	them	gathering	information	on	the	score	of	    	their	characters	and	ascertaining	whether	there	exist	motives	    	why	they	should	depone	out	of	hatred	or	illwill	towards	the	    	prisoner		
that	letter	contained	the	following	description	at	this	time	there	appeared	a	man	who	is	still	living	and	who	is	gifted	with	great	power		
the	energy	and	intelligence	inherent	in	men	of	their	race	were	serving	them	now	as	they	had	served	them	before	to	their	undoing		
but	after	they	had	been	delivered	from	this	by	the	saracen	invaders	to	whom	by	race	and	creed	they	were	fairly	sympathetic	they	enjoyedalike	under	moslem	and	christian	rulea	season	of	prosperity	in	spain	which	endured	until	the	close	of	the	thirteenth	century		
consider	articles	iv	v	and	vii	concerning	the	assumption	of	clean	linen	on	saturdays	and	the	stripping	of	fat	from	beef	and	mutton	which	nowise	offend	against	the	christian	faith	and	might	well	be	the	perpetuation	of	customs	acquired	before	baptism	was	received		
according	to	the	statements	of	yucé	and	of	juan	franco	it	is	the	latter	’s	brother	who	opened	the	veins	in	the	boy	’s	arms	whereas	ocaña	said	that	this	was	done	by	yucé		
many	other	matters	received	attention	amongst	them	the	necessity	for	remedying	the	evils	arising	out	of	the	commerce	between	christians	and	jews	was	seriously	considered		
xx		
husée	prince	of	the	jews	of	constantinople	       	the	matter	of	these	lettersso	very	obviously	forgedwas	freely	circulated		
as	a	matter	of	fact	bernaldez	the	only	available	authority	who	mentions	susan	’s	end	tells	us	specifically	that	he	died	a	christian		
from	limborch	’s	historia	inquisitionis	at	first	glance	this	statement	appears	untrue		
meanwhile	however	and	by	his	own	act	his	enemies	at	home	had	found	two	powerful	mediators	with	the	pope	two	powerful	advocates	to	plead	their	cause	before	the	apostolic	court		
ii		
after	some	days	thus	employed	in	preparing	the	prisoner	for	death	the	inquisitor	should	advise	the	secular	justices	of	the	day	and	hour	and	place	when	and	where	he	would	abandon	to	them	a	heretic		
to	lessen	this	risk	as	far	as	possible	don	diego	directed	at	first	a	southerly	and	then	a	westerly	course	and	so	taking	a	line	midway	between	the	islands	of	tobago	and	grenada	they	won	safely	through	the	dangerzone	and	came	into	the	comparative	security	of	the	caribbean	sea		
but	it	must	be	contrived	nevertheless		
while	you	waste	your	time	here	the	hours	are	passing		
he	had	succeeded	so	well	in	his	intentions	that	he	had	aroused	no	suspicion	until	he	saluted	the	fort	at	short	range	with	a	broadside	of	twenty	guns		
meanwhile	ogle	was	growing	impatient		
and	in	that	case	where	was	the	genius	that	would	have	turned	the	tables	on	these	rascally	spaniards	why	speak	of	it	now	mr.		
thoughtfully	he	rubbed	his	chin		
the	comedy	was	ended		
the	three	vessels	to	which	he	confined	it	were	the	arabella	the	la	foudre	which	cahusac	now	commanded	with	a	contingent	of	some	sixscore	frenchmen	and	the	santiago	which	had	been	refitted	and	rechristened	the	elizabeth	after	that	queen	of	england	whose	seamen	had	humbled	spain	as	captain	blood	now	hoped	to	humble	it	again		
but	what	of	me	cahusac	with	the	pearls	clutched	in	his	capacious	hand	stepped	up	to	him	on	the	other	side		
his	lordship	was	past	amazement		
he	raised	his	voice	in	answering		
and	in	all	this	time	not	a	single	shot	had	the	spaniards	contrived	to	fire	so	completely	had	they	been	taken	by	surprise	and	so	swift	and	paralyzing	had	been	blood	's	stroke		
there	is	warformally	warbetween	france	and	spain	in	europe		
you	have	a	good	opinion	of	yourself	on	the	contrary		
our	brief	separation	has	been	mighty	profitable	was	captain	blood	's	greeting

then	in	an	even	quieter	voice	than	before	miss	bishop	asked	who	killed	him	pitt	answered	readily		
it	's	a	busy	morning	we	've	both	had	he	was	in	high	goodhumour	as	he	led	the	way	to	the	great	cabin	for	a	rendering	of	accounts		
it	was	he	declared	afterwards	one	of	the	bitterest	moments	in	his	career		
he	conceived	the	scorn	with	which	she	would	come	to	hear	of	his	having	turned	pirate	and	the	scorn	though	as	yet	no	more	than	imagined	hurt	him	as	if	it	were	already	a	reality		
did	he	say	the	girl	was	present	too	yes		
wolverstone	laughed	again	whereat	his	lordship	flushed		
it	's	our	only	chance	i	've	said	and	we	must	take	it	the	better	way	that	was	in	captain	blood	's	mind	was	the	way	that	already	he	had	proposed	to	wolverstone		
her	inconsiderate	brother	might	have	ruined	that	romantic	scene	but	for	the	watchful	cahusac	who	quietly	tripped	him	up	and	then	trussed	him	like	a	fowl		
miss	bishop	sat	bemused	her	brows	knit	her	brooding	glance	seeming	to	study	the	fine	spanish	point	that	edged	the	tablecloth		
m.	d'ogeron	had	not	troubled	to	restrain	his	highpitched	voice	and	the	captain	had	overheard	the	frenchman	's	last	two	sentences		
mr.		
he	cursed	all	things	that	daggled	petticoats	and	knowing	his	world	waited	for	the	sickness	to	pass		
ye	do	n't	know	colonel	bishop	that	's	clear		
quickly	but	eloquently	blood	expressed	his	thanks	where	he	knew	that	no	thanks	were	due		
then	by	god	he	roared		
and	what	would	governor	steed	do	then	ye're	not	the	only	doctor	on	the	island	mr.		
well	wellas	i	said	beforepraemonitus	praemunitus		
we	fell	in	with	old	don	miguel	and	when	we	'd	scuttled	him	we	took	aboard	a	london	pimp	sent	out	by	the	secretary	of	state	to	offer	the	captain	the	king	's	commission	if	so	be	him'd	quit	piracy	and	be	o	good	behaviour		
in	an	unsteady	hand	he	wrote	that	summons	to	his	officers		
but	what	is	it	in	reality	will	you	tell	me		
his	mouth	fell	open		
then	letting	his	arms	fall	helplessly	to	his	sides	in	dejection	he	departed		
nay	sir	that	is	an	evasion		
don	miguel	swore	profanely	and	then	as	the	helm	was	put	over	to	swing	her	back	to	her	course	his	own	prow	replied		
he	doffed	his	hat	and	stood	aside	to	give	her	passage		
the	doctor	was	kept	in	constant	attendance	upon	him	until	long	after	midnight	when	at	last	he	was	able	to	ease	the	sufferer	a	little	by	a	bleeding		
but	the	next	man	a	middleaged	colossus	named	wolverstone	who	had	lost	an	eye	at	sedgemoor	drew	his	regard	and	the	haggling	was	recommenced		
it	would	ruin	me		
sure	i	walked	into	a	trap	as	ye	feared	jeremy	blood	hailed	him

and	then	they	understood

levasseur	dashed	one	hand	against	the	other	as	if	dusting	them		
she	made	a	little	impatient	movement	with	her	hand	and	looked	away	from	him	a	moment	out	to	sea		
i	am	sorry	i	should	have	been	sought	aye	and	you	'll	be	sorrier	yet		
he	turned	again	to	face	miss	bishop		
now	we	come	to	it		
he	noted	the	sheen	of	her	redbrown	hair	and	how	gracefully	one	of	its	heavy	ringlets	coiled	upon	her	slender	milkwhite	neck		
that	is	yet	to	be	proved	in	action	said	he		
i	've	no	doubt	at	all	the	spanish	admiral	will	welcome	the	abatement	of	our	numbers	even	at	this	late	date		
and	i	'll	be	wishing	ye	both	a	very	good	day	he	swept	off	his	feathered	hat	and	made	them	a	leg	very	elegantly		
then	he	fingered	the	muscles	of	the	young	man	's	arm	and	bade	him	open	his	mouth	that	he	might	see	his	teeth		
remembering	it	he	went	off	at	the	double	despite	his	bulk	and	the	heat	his	negroes	trotting	after	him		
as	she	lay	awake	idly	watching	the	rippled	green	water	that	appeared	to	be	streaming	past	the	heavily	glazed	porthole	she	became	gradually	aware	of	the	sounds	of	swift	laboured	bustlethe	clatter	of	many	feet	the	shouts	of	hoarse	voices	and	the	persistent	trundlings	of	heavy	bodies	in	the	wardroom	immediately	below	the	deck	of	the	cabin		
as	he	advanced	bishop	turned	to	regard	him	scowling		
his	voice	sank	again		
over	his	shoulder	captain	blood	observed	her	approach

his	eyes	took	in	the	situation	at	a	glance	as	captain	blood	rose	to	greet	him		
i	ca	n't	think	that	it	would	make	the	least	difference	if	he	did	said	his	lordship	gravely		
that	offer	i	rejected	as	his	lordship	will	tell	you	deeming	myself	affronted	by	it		
lord	julian	span	round	to	face	him	and	clapped	a	hand	to	his	sword		
truss	him	wrist	and	heel	but	do	n't	hurt	himnot	so	much	as	a	hair	of	his	precious	head	the	injunction	was	very	necessary		
her	beakhead	was	in	splinters	and	a	shot	had	smashed	through	into	the	great	cabin	reducing	it	to	wreckage		
you	misunderstand	he	said	swallowing	his	rage		
the	supreme	council	of	castile	might	anon	condemn	him	for	his	practices

thus	almost	silently	without	challenge	or	exchange	of	signals	had	action	been	mutually	determined		
he	stepped	forward	swinging	his	light	bamboo	cane		
it	's	close	upon	a	month	since	last	i	saw	you	twentyone	days	to	the	hour	said	he		
i	marvel	that	i	do	n't	pistol	you	without	more	ado	ye	fat	blackguard
