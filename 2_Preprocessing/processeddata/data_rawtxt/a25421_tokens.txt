it	saved	my	life		
next	morning	on	the	way	to	the	electric	train	ernie	made	a	purchase	at	the	drugstore		
and	cheer	up	i	say		
nevertheless	there	were	times	when	he	seriously	wished	he	'd	never	acquired	whatever	power	it	wasexcept	for	vivian	of	course		
his	sister	grabbed	his	arm		
then	he	saw	he	was	parked	in	front	of	a	demolished	old	apartment	building	a	few	blocks	from	his	home		
it	became	noticeable	about	eighteen	inches	above	the	drop	and	almost	an	inch	to	each	sidean	invisible	slim	vertical	cylinder		
right	there	died	his	tentative	plan	of	eventually	sharing	his	secret	with	some	friend	who	knew	more	than	himself	about	motors	he	had	n't	decided	anyway	who	that	would	be		
like	the	thoughts	of	a	drowning	man	riffling	an	infinitypaneled	adventurecomic	of	his	life	as	he	bolts	his	last	rough	ration	of	air		
flashing	eyes		
i	tell	him	he	's	attractive	because	he	has	flashing	eyes	and	within	two	days	he	's	wearing	black	glasses		
great	relief		
afterward	bert	willis	used	to	say	it	was	one	of	the	most	mystifying	experiences	of	his	life		
there	was	nothing	to	see		
i	mean	are	they	painful		
but	my	chief	sources	of	information	i	am	not	permitted	to	disclose		
he	moved	stiffly	toward	the	door		
he	did	n't	care	who	yelled	at	him	or	whom	he	bumped	so	long	as	it	did	n't	slow	him	down		
ernie	jumped	up	and	blurted	out	introductions		
uncle	fabius	demanded	sharply	to	ernie	's	surprise	and	embarrassment		
now	sober	again	he	had	a	clear	confirmation	of	it	when	he	left	a	banquet	on	a	trumpedup	excuse	because	of	a	disturbing	vision	of	inexplicable	rodlike	shapesand	read	the	next	day	that	a	hundred	of	the	guests	of	whom	four	finally	died	had	come	down	with	bacterial	food	poisoning		
who	's	been	getting	at	you		
he	'd	wake	in	the	middle	of	the	night	doubting	that	he	had	ever	really	read	the	minddizzying	lettering	ever	really	tested	the	stuffperhaps	he	'd	bring	from	sleep	the	chilling	notion	that	in	the	dimness	and	excitement	of	saturday	morning	he	'd	put	the	water	in	some	other	car	's	gas	tank	perhaps	mr.	jones	's		
he	puts	her	on	whenever	he	gets	afraid	he	's	getting	attractive		
mr.	jones	brought	him	over	half	an	hour	ago	and	it	's	all	arranged		
no	thanks		
size	shape	materials	blue	color	closure	etc	were	exactly	as	they	should	be		
he	thought	of	the	blur	of	green	flashes	inside	the	purring	motor		
ernie	was	one	in	a	long	series	of	such	men		
that	circumstance	seemed	beyond	imagination		
for	instance	that	trick	of	having	the	images	on	the	box	fade	back	to	the	old	ones		
he	had	n't	intended	to	wear	them	by	day	and	hardly	knew	why	he	'd	put	them	on	before	joining	vivian		
he	was	pale		
ernie	they	had	to	admit	was	a	remarkably	wellpreserved	old	gent		
and	how		
no	she	said	i	did	n't	and	she	looked	at	him	steadily	as	she	had	that	morning		
he	knew	that	the	powder	worked		
i	'm	putting	some	eyedrops	in	them	now		
now	he	had	used	the	tube	to	siphon	out	what	he	could	of	the	remainder	he	still	could	taste	the	stuff		
he	told	himself	the	blade	was	noticeably	duller	today		
after	dinner	he	decided	it	was	the	thuringer	sausage	he	'd	eaten	at	lunch		
the	people	were	just	blurs	anyway	and	soon	he	was	beyond	them		
thuringer	sausage	at	lunch		
ironic	considering	what	a	drunk	he	'd	been	and	what	strange	junk	he	insisted	on	eating	now		
me	attractive		
next	moment	he	was	in	a	small	cab	under	which	steel	rails	were	vanishing	at	an	alarming	speed	and	way	ahead	he	could	just	make	out	the	platform	on	which	he	was	standing	and	something	was	hurting	his	head	and	he	was	slumping	forward	and	everything	was	darkening	and	the	cab	was	leaping	forward	more	swiftly	still		
however	they	were	grateful	to	the	cosmic	allfather		
add	    	water	as	needed		
he	turned	it	over	several	times		
he	was	trying	to	be	the	same	without	much	success		
this	is	where	i	get	off		
oh		
he	cautiously	explored	the	boundaries	of	the	heat		
pretty	soon	the	unbearable	edgeofdoom	clarity	in	his	mind	faded	the	universemacaroni	cooked	down	to	a	thick	white	soup	uniform	as	fog	and	the	words	of	the	detective	story	were	sliding	into	his	mind	individually	or	at	most	in	strings	of	three	and	four		
vivian	accepted	his	seat	with	a	certain	deliberateness	and	with	a	smile	that	seemed	to	ernie	to	say	so	i	'm	his	morning	lightbadinage	girl	but	this	is	the	girl	mr.	meeker	goes	home	with		
for	a	good	half	a	day	ernie	meeker	studied	the	rows	of	jars	canisters	and	glassstoppered	bottles	sometimes	lifting	two	down	together	and	contemplating	them	one	in	each	hand	as	if	he	could	weigh	the	difference		
i	do	hope	you	wo	n't	mind		
ernie	meeker	had	discovered	inside	the	birthday	box	that	was	himself	the	first	of	the	big	gifts		
in	fact	he	felt	distinctly	apathetic	when	his	sister	confronted	him	and	only	with	an	effort	did	he	manage	to	brace	himself	for	the	trial	he	knew	she	had	in	store	for	him		
that	evening	marked	the	beginning	of	ernie	's	serious	drinking		
but	under	the	present	circumstances	ernie	was	confused		
in	any	case	do	n't	get	conceited	about	your	flashing	eyes	because	i	'm	sure	you	'll	never	know	how	to	take	advantage	of	them		
which	if	it	was	n't	as	it	ideally	should	be	in	an	ambitious	man	's	mind	was	at	least	darn	comfortable		
ernie	nodded		
ridiculous	of	course		
things	should	behave	as	you	expected	them	to	in	accordance	with	their	flimsy	souls	he	told	himself	at	the	barely	conscious	level		
it	was	the	comfortable	expected	reassuring	way		
gifts	are	upsetting		
verna	on	the	other	hand	had	absolute	confidence	that	she	was	sufficiently	attractive	for	all	practical	purposes		
it	's	his	life	and	he	's	doing	what	he	thinks	best		
sometimes	i	think	the	tests	are	too	fair	the	coadjutor	observed		
she	nodded	absently		
that	last	picture	was	the	most	vivid	and	when	he	realized	he	had	actually	stopped	his	car	it	was	a	moment	before	it	would	go	away		
could	there	be	something	wrong	about	the	bathroom	something	either	in	the	room	itself	or	in	his	childhood	associations		
as	the	invisible	being	had	predicted	ernie	's	first	brush	with	the	great	gift	gave	him	a	considerable	jolt	though	he	did	n't	suspect	at	first	that	it	was	a	permanent	gift		
just	that	you	put	your	hand	up	to	them	as	if	they	hurt		
it	was	while	you	were	out	of	the	room		
and	yet	he	did	no	more	bathroom	testing		
if	he	'd	concocted	it	himself	or	been	given	it	by	a	shady	promoter	or	even	seen	the	box	fall	out	of	the	pocket	of	a	suspiciouslooking	man	in	a	trenchcoat	then	he	'd	have	felt	more	able	to	do	something	about	it	whether	in	the	general	line	of	starting	a	fuelpowder	company	or	of	going	to	the	f.b.i.		
of	course	the	car	still	ran		
in	that	case	uncle	fabius	opined	you	can	be	sure	some	fuelpowder	swindler	has	been	getting	at	him		
once	at	a	party	he	bet	twenty	dollars	that	his	eyes	glowed	in	the	dark		
like	many	another	carowning	commuter	ernie	found	the	traffic	and	parking	problems	a	bit	too	much	for	comfort	and	so	used	the	fast	electric	train	to	carry	him	five	times	a	week	to	the	heart	of	the	city		
the	butcher	looked	brute	squarely	in	the	eyes		
it	's	more	than	a	matter	of	polarization		
you	underfives	simply	are	n't	allowed	in	the	time	theater		
perhaps	because	of	the	intense	darkness	of	the	theater	you	have	n't	realized	how	dimly	lit	the	scene	is		
sic	'em	darter		
well	what	if	i	will		
i	know	the	butcher	said	irritably		
hold	still	cynthia	a	new	voice	cut	in		
but	even	he	sounded	a	little	solemn	and	subdued		
my	father	remembers	when	there	was	n't	a	time	theater	hal	said	softly	as	he	scanned	the	facade	's	glowing	charts	and	maps		
joggy	nodded		
a	sphincter	dilated	and	they	found	themselves	in	a	small	transparent	cubicle	from	which	they	could	watch	the	show	without	disturbing	the	adult	audience		
how	about	it	joggy		
most	of	the	light	goes	down	the	vistas	visible	to	the	other	side	of	the	audience		
but	i	do	n't	feel	any	older	joggy	replied	doubtfully		
you	quit	that		
unwillingly	eyes	still	fixed	on	the	blackness	ahead	brute	obeyed		
the	sorcerer	appeared	to	be	expostulating	commanding		
you	tricked	him	into	thinking	you	were	older	and	his	brain	waves	blanketed	yours	going	through	the	usher		
a	growl		
there	was	a	moment	of	rocking	and	pitching	during	which	each	boy	accused	the	other	of	trying	to	upset	them		
i	've	heard	an	uninj	is	programmed	with	so	many	genuine	canine	reactions	that	it	practically	has	racial	memory		
i	do	n't	know	but	it	sounds	great		
then	the	warrior	was	standing	outside	the	bubble	blinking	toward	the	shadows	rain	dripping	from	his	beard	and	furs		
the	butcher	asked	eagerly		
yes	but	suppose	they	did	all	the	same		
the	butcher	grimly	slipped	out	the	metal	tube	and	put	it	to	his	lips		
they	have	to	be		
in	the	cubicle	hal	and	joggy	gasped	the	two	girls	squeaked	but	the	butcher	yelled	a	hey		
hal	and	joggy	switched	off	their	levitators	and	dropped	to	their	feet		
but	he	did	n't	stay	quiet		
why		
a	woman	in	a	short	golden	tunic	stood	up	uncertainly	from	the	front	row	of	the	audience		
a	viewing	anomaly	has	occurred	the	interpreter	announced		
the	hooded	figure	is	a	most	unusual	find		
adults	are	n't	conditioned	to	reject	violent	solutions	to	problems	where	nonhuman	enemies	are	concerned		
the	butcher	countered	hotly		
it	does	n't	matter	what	you	think	now	hal	said	with	finality		
while	you	're	deciding	we	'll	get	swimming		
the	butcher	hurled	himself	forward		
this	is	getting	good	the	butcher	said	squirming	toward	the	edge	of	his	seat		
but	it	's	no	more	alive	than	an	adolescer	or	a	kinderobot		
there	were	two	closely	spaced	faint	plops	and	a	large	green	stain	appeared	on	the	bare	back	of	one	girl	while	purple	fluid	dripped	from	the	closecropped	hair	of	the	other		
we	believe	it	to	be	that	of	a	sorcerer	who	pretended	to	control	the	forces	of	nature	and	see	into	the	future		
the	general	sensation	however	was	delightful	and	levitators	were	among	the	most	prized	of	toys		
great	brooding	trees	the	trunks	of	the	nearer	ones	sliced	by	the	bubble	's	surface	formed	the	background		
true	by	rocking	the	repulsor	hemisphere	backward	you	could	get	a	brief	forward	push	but	it	would	be	nullified	when	you	rocked	forward		
where	's	the	bodies		
even	if	the	minority	theory	should	prove	trueand	no	evidence	for	it	has	ever	appearedthere	are	automatically	operating	safeguards	to	protect	the	audience	from	any	harmful	consequences	of	time	traveling	almost	certainly	impossible	remember	in	either	direction		
they	glared	at	him	and	one	of	them	said	a	cub		
abrupt	light	flooded	the	time	theater		
you	think	so	now	hal	told	him		
oh	explanations		
hal	said	aghast		
brute	sprang	up	after	his	master	and	was	invisibly	rebuffed		
i	do	n't	exactly	know	but	something		
murmured	one	of	the	newly	arrived	girls		
hah		
there	's	a	good	reason	for	itsomething	dangerous	might	happen	if	an	underfive	got	inside		
hal	nudged	joggy	and	whispered	butch		
brute	must	have	smelled	em		
want	to	walk	us	there	butch		
and	instead	of	seeing	us	beyond	they	see	more	trees	and	sky		
when	he	was	about	four	feet	from	it	he	was	gently	bounced	away		
it	was	really	a	more	tiring	method	of	transportation	than	walking	and	quite	useless	against	the	wind		
he	kicked	brute	in	the	face		
the	warriors	who	had	emerged	from	the	bubble	stiffened	themselves	baring	their	teeth		
a	redheaded	adult	heard	and	smiled	and	paused	to	watch		
he	killed	cities	and	piled	the	skulls		
joggy	and	the	older	boy	were	swimming	lazily	through	the	air	at	shoulder	height		
the	butcher	encouraged		
butcher	that	was	n't	honest	hal	said	a	little	worriedly		
they	'll	condition	you	out	of	the	idea	hal	assured	him		
the	time	bubble	has	been	brought	to	rest	in	one	of	the	barbaric	cultures	of	the	dawn	era	a	soft	voice	explained	so	casually	that	joggy	looked	around	for	the	speaker	until	hal	nudged	him	sharply	whispering	with	barely	perceptible	embarrassment	do	n't	do	that	joggy		
well	even	if	it	is	about	tamerlane	you	ca	n't	see	it		
take	it	easy	brute	the	butcher	consoled	him		
rising	from	a	low	central	platform	was	a	huge	bubble	of	light	its	lower	surface	somewhat	flattened		
say	they	're	viewing	earth	somewhere	in	scandinavia	around	zero	in	the	b.c.a.d.	time	scale		
only	the	hooded	figure	which	they	seemed	to	regard	with	a	mingled	wonder	and	fear	swayed	incessantly	to	the	rhythm	of	some	unheard	chant		
he	looked	at	brute	with	guarded	wistfulness		
keep	your	seats		
back	and	forth	lean	wolflike	dogs	paced	with	restless	monotony		
maybe	he	's	getting	racial	memories	from	the	scands		
they	were	impatient	and	easily	incapacitated	by	frustration		
gods		
that	's	queer		
if	i	am	not	mistaken	we	have	laid	down	similar	caches		
the	explorer	exploded		
they	seem	to	have	been	obsessed	by	the	notion	that	others	greater	than	themselves	had	prospered	before	them	and	then	died	leaving	them	to	rebuild	a	civilization	from	ruins		
their	appetites	and	emotions	were	not	sufficiently	subordinated	to	their	understanding	and	to	their	sense	of	dramatheir	enjoyment	of	the	comedy	and	tragedy	of	existence		
i	could	n't	wait	to	hear	the	details		
if	i	am	to	tell	you	everything	you	want	to	know	i	must	tell	it	my	own	way		
you	'd	think	we	'd	be	turning	up	traces	everywhere		
they	seem	to	have	been	singularly	guilty	in	their	pleasures	behaving	either	like	gloomy	moralists	or	gluttons		
the	first	is	the	most	obvious		
all	in	good	time		
the	explorer	sounded	anguished		
at	any	rate	when	i	heard	that	what	we	were	looking	for	you	had	found	here	at	homeeven	though	dead	and	done	fori	felt	that	at	least	it	was	something		
the	present	is	always	more	important	than	the	future		
as	soon	as	our	spaceship	got	within	radio	range	of	earth	they	started	to	send	us	a	continuous	newscast	covering	the	period	of	our	absence		
they	might	have	been	birds	except	they	moved	too	slowly		
then	the	explorer	turned	back		
i	suppose	i	set	too	much	store	by	my	hopes	of	establishing	a	contact		
instead	i	touch	only	corpses		
the	explorer	burst	out	i	am	not	interested	in	all	that	dry	stuff		
yes	i	guess	you	're	right		
am	i	going	to	have	to	coax	you		
but	that	fourth	answerit	's	morbid		
it	captured	my	imagination		
our	past	is	strewn	with	our	dead		
cute	little	brute	is	n't	it		
really	your	absence	from	earth	has	unsettled	you	even	more	than	i	first	surmised		
i	grant	the	possibility	of	atomic	power	getting	out	of	hand	though	one	would	have	thought	they	'd	have	taken	the	greatest	precautions		
i	can	understand	that	after	your	long	absence	from	earth	any	news	of	earth	would	seem	especially	important		
they	had	spaceships		
if	these	creatures	were	relatively	advanced	why	have	n't	we	learned	about	them	before		
it	's	barely	possible		
i	'm	pleased	that	you	should	think	of	me	and	my	work	and	i	'm	very	happy	to	see	you	again		
he	looked	at	the	explorer	strangely		
their	technology	outstripped	their	psychology		
geologic	ages	of	it		
he	remarked		
i	have	four	answers	to	that	the	archeologist	replied		
the	archeologist	regarded	him	quizzically		
what	happiness	they	had	they	had		
one	of	the	items	exasperatingly	brief	mentioned	your	discovery		
i	mean	what	if	the	creatures	occupied	a	very	different	portion	of	the	earth	than	our	own		
you	old	devil	he	said	in	a	manner	that	showed	his	gayer	and	more	boisterous	mood	had	returned	though	diminished	you	still	have	n't	told	me	anything	definite	about	them		
what	did	they	want		
it	was	probably	created	in	a	kind	of	exuberant	fancifulness	with	no	serious	belief	that	it	would	ever	serve	the	purpose	for	which	it	was	intended		
again	the	slow	shadows	drifted	overhead		
why	not	species		
i	think	i	understand	the	archeologist	said	softly		
he	went	on	the	cache	was	laid	down	when	they	were	first	attempting	space	flight	just	after	their	discovery	of	atomic	power	in	the	first	flush	of	their	youth		
so	i	have	n't	replied	the	archeologist	with	guileful	innocence		
the	archeologist	gently	waved	aside	the	questions		
what	were	they	like		
after	a	moment	the	archeologist	continued	my	reconstruction	of	their	history	subsequent	to	the	laying	down	of	the	cache	has	been	largely	hypothetical		
somehow	one	thinks	of	an	alien	species	as	having	just	one	language		
they	skimped	fatally	when	it	came	to	hard	thinking	about	the	purpose	of	life	and	intellectual	activity	and	the	means	for	preserving	them		
well	we	found	some	planets	with	life	upon	them	all	right		
what	about	what		
his	expression	showed	only	pleasure	at	being	reunited	with	a	longabsent	friend		
it	's	the	find	of	the	age		
his	excitement	had	visibly	evaporated	leaving	behind	a	cold	and	miserable	residue	of	feeling		
third	it	's	possible	that	atomic	energy	out	of	control	finished	the	race	and	destroyed	its	traces		
you	shift	in	an	instant	from	zenith	to	nadirand	remember	out	there	you	can	see	both		
still	it	could	happen		
interrupted	the	explorer		
what	did	they	create		
i	am	not	sure	i	want	to	hear	much	more	about	them	he	said		
there	is	a	kind	of	unraveling	or	erasing		
these	words	and	symbols	seem	to	have	come	down	unchanged	from	their	most	distant	prehistory		
the	explorer	turned	away		
they	set	great	store	by	personal	prestige	by	the	amassing	of	wealth	and	the	exercise	of	power		
supplementary	material	has	been	very	slow	in	coming	in	though	we	are	still	making	extensive	excavations	at	widely	separated	points		
there	's	so	little	of	it	and	it	's	so	lonely		
time		
machines	are	broken	up	and	worked	into	primitive	tools	and	weapons		
but	admit	it	now	is	n't	there	something	a	bit	odd	about	your	getting	so	worked	up	over	this	thing		
and	all	the	while	there	was	wriggling	toward	them	out	of	that	future	for	which	they	yearned	oh	it	's	so	completely	futile	and	unfair		
several	small	shadows	crossed	the	windows	overhead		
give	me	the	wet		
i	rather	hope	they	did	since	it	would	mean	the	chance	of	a	survival	elsewhere	though	the	negative	results	of	your	expedition	rather	lessen	that		
the	present	distribution	of	radioactive	compounds	throughout	the	earth	's	surface	lends	some	support	to	this	theory		
the	archeologist	's	expression	showed	that	this	was	not	altogether	untrue
