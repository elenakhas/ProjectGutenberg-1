it	would	never	arrive	in	time		
i	can	not	talk	here	with	you	alone		
stephen	went	on	impassively		
for	you	and	your	happiness	i	would	do	anythinganything		
when	about	twenty	feet	from	the	waterlevel	the	path	jutted	out	to	one	side	left	of	the	little	beach	whereon	the	sea	now	broke	fiercely		
leave	it	all	to	me		
but	tell	me	auntie	was	there	never	any	one	that	you	did	love		
never	in	his	life	did	he	ride	faster	than	on	the	road	to	norling	parva		
and	its	glory	seemed	to	rest	upon	her	whilst	she	slept		
when	they	were	quite	alone	and	out	of	earshot	she	said	i	have	been	thinking	all	night	about	poor	mother		
from	the	windows	you	can	see	all	round	the	promontory		
you	know	auntie	dear	that	young	men	will	be	young	men	in	such	matters	or	perhaps	you	do	not	since	the	only	person	who	ever	worried	you	has	been	myself		
after	all	the	matter	was	too	serious	to	allow	of	the	possibility	of	levity		
there	were	tears	in	his	eyes	as	he	wrung	the	squire	's	hand	his	voice	thrilled	with	feeling	as	he	said	your	many	goodnesses	to	my	father	's	son	sir	will	i	hope	be	justified	by	his	love	and	loyalty		
had	any	one	told	her	that	her	preparations	for	this	interview	were	made	deliberately	with	some	of	the	astuteness	that	dominated	the	devil	when	he	took	jesus	to	the	top	of	a	high	mountain	and	showed	him	all	the	kingdoms	of	the	earth	at	his	feet	she	would	have	and	with	truth	denied	it	with	indignation		
as	the	mother	looked	on	delighted	she	thought	she	had	never	seen	a	more	beautiful	sight		
he	had	been	out	there	during	the	day	and	the	captain	who	had	noticed	his	habit	had	had	rigged	up	a	canvas	dodger	on	the	rail	on	the	weather	side		
hector	and	i	may	be	able	to	do	something	together		
he	said	angrily	that	letter	is	nothing	but	a	simple	note	from	a	young	girl	to	an	old	friendplaymate	asking	him	to	come	to	see	her	about	some	trivial	thing		
that	she	was	of	great	estate	and	richly	left	made	all	things	possible	to	any	man	who	had	sufficient	acquisitiveness	or	a	good	conceit	of	himself		
the	swimmer	still	held	the	line	thrown	to	him	and	several	men	on	the	pier	began	to	draw	on	it		
she	would	do	what	she	could	but	first	she	must	understand	the	situation		
she	would	plan	and	act	and	manage	things	for	herself	in	her	own	way		
such	noble	trust	and	generosity	as	you	have	shown	me	demands	a	return	of	trust		
the	last	phrase	was	added	on	seeing	stephen	's	surprised	look		
any	other	man	who	did	n't	know	so	much	about	swimming	as	he	does	would	try	to	reach	the	lifebuoy	and	would	choke	the	two	of	them	with	the	spindrift	in	the	trying		
gad		
she	simply	asked	me	to	give	you	the	money		
that	spanish	girl	is	beginning	to	kick	too		
chapter	xiiiharold	's	resolve	as	they	went	on	their	way	harold	noticed	that	leonard	's	breathing	became	more	regular	as	in	honest	sleep		
		
he	plunged	at	once	into	his	purpose		
there	does	not	seem	to	be	blame	for	him	who	is	the	more	guilty		
you	must	do	so	i	tell	you	you	must		
but	you	certainly	shall	not	do	so	till	you	know	what	i	know		
the	protest	broke	from	him	with	a	groan		
she	came	back	to	the	sound	of	the	dressinggong	with	a	better	strength	to	resist	the	trial	before	her		
confound	women	they	all	seemed	to	want	him	to	marry	them		
it	seemed	to	harold	that	a	great	bell	was	sounding	in	his	ears.'before	the	end		
besides	there	was	proof		
not	having	been	able	to	obtain	any	reply	to	our	letters	we	sent	one	of	our	clerks	first	to	the	addresses	in	london	and	afterwards	to	oxford		
chapter	xxxthe	lesson	of	the	wilderness	in	the	west	the	two	years	flew		
the	two	men	usually	liked	to	talk	over	the	meeting	as	they	returned	home	together		
chapter	xixa	letter	on	monday	evening	after	dinner	mr.	everard	and	his	son	sat	for	a	while	in	silence		
god	help	you	to	judge	wisely		
if	they	are	innocent	i	want	to	know	what	the	circumstances	can	be	which	make	innocence	look	like	guilt		
the	boatswain	leaning	over	the	bow	grabbed	the	child	and	with	one	sweep	of	his	strong	arm	took	her	into	the	boat		
i	am	very	young	perhaps	too	young	to	think	such	things		
i	shall	kill	myself	if	i	like		
i	do	n't	know		
why	sir	he	said	i	put	it	in	your	name	as	they	had	written	to	you		
he	held	out	his	arms	imploringly		
your	title	of	countess	de	lannoy	comes	to	you	through	your	ancestor	isobel	third	and	youngest	daughter	of	the	sixth	earl	messrs	collinbrae	and	jackson	knowing	that	my	firm	acted	for	your	family	communicated	with	us		
and	oh		
there	was	so	different	a	note	in	her	voice	that	the	other	's	heart	leaped	as	she	heard	her	say	god	be	thanked	for	these	tears		
harold	was	simply	shy	and	objecting	to	the	publicity	which	he	felt	to	be	his	fate	remained	in	his	cabin	till	the	trumpet	had	blown	the	dinner	call		
the	more	we	know	the	better	are	we	able	to	deceive	others	and	the	better	we	are	able	to	deceive	others	the	better	we	are	able	to	deceive	ourselves		
he	resolutely	turned	his	back	on	the	thought	of	his	own	side	of	the	matter	and	tried	to	find	some	justification	of	stephen	's	act		
i	thought	such	things	did	not	take	place	that	men	were	more	honourable	or	more	considerate	or	more	merciful		
the	child	anxiously	called	after	him	as	he	hurried	away		
beyond	this	first	step	he	could	do	nothing	think	of	nothing	as	yet		
you	may	take	it	auntie	dear	that	in	the	way	you	mean	leonard	is	nothing	to	me	can	never	be	anything	to	me		
unhappily	the	thin	cord	broke	under	the	strain	and	within	a	few	seconds	the	swimmer	had	drifted	out	of	possible	help		
the	selfcontent	the	sexcontent	in	the	endless	tide	of	young	men	that	thronged	the	streets	and	quads	and	parks	the	all	sufficing	nature	of	sport	or	study	to	whichever	their	inclinations	tended		
so	it	was	with	harold		
wo	n't	you	listen	to	me	for	a	few	minutes		
but	i	must	know	the	truth	as	i	proceed		
his	heart	warmed	to	the	kindly	old	man	and	he	wished	to	spare	him	pain	even	if	he	could	not	accept	him	proposition	he	could	n't	take	it	ill	unless	he	was	an	awful	bounder		
she	does	not	know	you	now		
wo	n't	you	understand	that	i	want	to	do	what	is	best	for	you		
harold	groaned	again	leonard	's	eyes	brightened	still	more	and	the	evil	smile	on	his	face	grew	broader	as	he	began	more	and	more	to	feel	his	power		
whilst	harold	was	speaking	the	doctor	had	told	the	men	who	accustomed	to	hunting	accidents	had	taken	a	gate	from	its	hinges	and	held	it	in	readiness	to	bring	it	closer		
no	matter	what	adventure	came	to	him	the	thought	of	neglected	duty	returned	ever	afresh		
it	was	hardly	any	wonder	then	that	in	time	harold	found	himself	alone	in	the	midst	of	one	of	the	great	treasureplaces	of	the	world		
harold	answered	out	of	the	bitterness	of	his	heart		
indeed	since	i	am	assured	of	the	payment	of	your	debts	i	feel	justified	in	my	action		
you	will	have	time	and	opportunity	where	you	are	going		
among	the	latter	were	the	stonehouses	who	were	old	travellers		
a	horse	he	could	hear	its	hard	breathing		
but	to	stephen	all	the	mystery	seemed	to	grow	out	of	its	first	shadowy	importance	into	something	real		
you	saved	my	child		
taking	a	pen	he	turned	to	miss	rowly	and	said	what	shall	i	write		
he	never	said	a	word	about	it	till	he	threatened	to	kill	methe	great	brute		
also	that	the	places	to	be	considered	were	desert	so	far	as	human	habitation	or	population	are	considered		
they	made	a	vast	kite	which	they	caused	to	be	flown	over	the	centre	spot	of	the	incursion		
suppose	we	wait	till	we	are	alone	and	have	lots	of	time	before	us		
mr.	salton	was	delighted	to	find	his	young	relative	already	constructively	the	owner	of	so	fine	an	estateone	which	gave	him	an	important	status	in	the	county		
he	got	from	ross	several	more	mongooses	including	a	second	kingcobrakiller	which	he	generally	carried	with	him	in	its	box	whenever	he	walked	out		
there	was	again	a	pause	and	sir	nathaniel	endeavoured	to	get	back	to	less	emotional	and	more	neutral	ground		
to	kill	snakes		
sir	nathaniel	smiled	in	a	fatherly	way		
i	am	not	usually	a	patient	man	and	the	sight	of	that	ugly	devil	is	enough	to	make	one	's	blood	boil		
when	mimi	was	quite	alone	with	lilla	and	the	need	for	effort	had	ceased	she	felt	weak	and	trembled		
of	course	neighbours	in	the	position	of	the	watfords	knew	all	about	adam	salton	his	relationship	circumstances	and	prospects		
but	what	can	we	do	sirit	seems	a	most	difficult	problem		
in	the	meantime	she	would	show	no	hurryshe	must	wait		
i	promise	you	there	shall	be	nothing	that	could	cause	him	anxiety	in	our	silence	or	at	which	he	could	take	umbrage		
i	know	it	for	we	were	boys	together		
the	basement	is	very	strong	almost	as	strong	and	as	heavy	as	if	it	had	been	intended	as	a	fortress		
as	for	myself	the	bonds	of	will	which	held	me	inactive	seemed	like	bands	of	steel	which	numbed	all	my	faculties	except	sight	and	hearing		
lady	arabella	's	anger	now	fully	awake	was	all	for	oolanga		
with	his	friend	's	aid	adam	secured	the	property	without	loss	of	time		
strangely	enough	as	it	seemed	to	the	others	the	person	who	took	the	ghastly	silence	least	to	heart	was	the	negro		
i	killed	her		
the	author	goes	into	the	question	of	the	close	association	of	the	then	edgar	caswall	with	mesmer	in	paris		
adam	's	comment	pleased	the	old	gentleman		
are	you	sure		
and	now	as	to	what	we	are	to	do		
this	evidently	made	a	difficulty	for	mr.	caswall	for	his	efforts	without	appearing	to	get	feebler	seemed	less	effective		
because	he	answered	slowly	i	have	a	conviction	which	seems	to	answer	all	the	conditions	of	second	sight		
then	quite	unexpectedly	the	negro	noticed	the	presence	of	a	third	personadam	salton		
mr.	caswall	too	took	new	courage	from	her	coming	and	all	his	masterfulness	and	power	came	back	to	him		
breakfast	had	been	a	silent	function	so	it	did	not	interfere	in	any	way	with	the	process	of	thought		
he	played	the	host	so	well	as	to	deceive	even	adam		
from	his	room	he	could	see	all	round	the	neighbourhood	but	the	two	places	that	interested	him	most	were	mercy	farm	and	diana	's	grove		
unhappily	i	wore	it	yesterday		
caswall	without	being	enthusiastic	on	the	subject	had	been	courteous	and	attentive	as	she	had	walked	back	to	diana	's	grove	she	almost	congratulated	herself	on	her	new	settlement	in	life		
none	of	these	was	like	it	though	it	had	something	of	them	all	with	added	the	sourness	of	chemical	waste	and	the	poisonous	effluvium	of	the	bilge	of	a	water	logged	ship	whereon	a	multitude	of	rats	had	been	drowned		
now	it	is	a	scientific	law	that	increase	implies	gain	and	loss	of	various	kinds	what	a	thing	gains	in	one	direction	it	may	lose	in	another		
said	adam		
do	you	think	sir	that	it	would	be	well	for	me	to	buy	diana	's	grove		
the	strength	used	for	such	an	act	must	have	been	terrific		
a	great	london	physician	came	down	but	could	do	nothingindeed	he	said	that	the	girl	would	not	survive	the	night		
the	cold	of	the	white	features	thrilled	through	her	and	she	utterly	collapsed	when	it	was	borne	in	on	her	that	lilla	had	passed	away		
do	n't	let	me	ever	see	your	hideous	face	here	again	or	i	shall	rid	the	earth	of	you		
that	still	leaves	us	three	to	two		
adam	and	oolanga	both	had	pistols	lady	arabella	who	had	not	one	was	probably	the	most	ready	of	them	all	in	the	theory	of	shooting	but	that	being	impossible	she	made	her	effort	in	another	way		
to	this	end	he	applied	himself	to	quite	another	matteran	investigation	of	the	other	treasures	and	rare	objects	in	his	collections		
it	will	help	us	to	understand	what	is	before	us	in	the	way	of	difficulty		
at	that	time	i	would	have	had	a	search	madeeven	excavation	if	necessaryat	my	own	expense	but	all	suggestions	were	met	with	a	prompt	and	explicit	negative		
if	so	you	are	wasting	your	time		
when	he	was	engaged	in	any	struggle	of	wits	he	was	all	diplomatist		
he	said	no	word	in	either	praise	or	disparagement	but	in	the	centre	of	the	grove	where	hidden	amongst	ancient	oak	stumps	was	a	block	of	granite	slightly	hollowed	on	the	top	he	bent	low	and	placed	his	forehead	on	the	ground		
later	when	she	was	alone	and	had	time	to	think	it	was	a	passing	grief	to	her	that	she	would	have	to	be	silent	for	a	time	to	lilla	on	the	happy	events	of	that	strange	mission		
that	the	idea	was	becoming	fixed	in	her	mind	was	shown	by	a	letter	which	she	wrote	later	in	the	day	to	adam	salton	and	sent	to	him	by	hand		
caswall		
chapter	xiithe	chest	opened	left	alone	in	the	turretroom	edgar	caswall	carefully	locked	the	door	and	hung	a	handkerchief	over	the	keyhole		
that	is	the	proper	way	to	look	at	it		
he	asked	permission	to	clean	and	polish	and	sharpen	thema	favour	which	was	readily	granted		
ha		
he	was	just	going	out	backward	when	lady	arabella	who	had	been	gazing	at	him	with	fixed	eyes	caught	his	hand	and	tried	to	stop	his	movement		
you	will	think	it	strange	that	i	should	suspect	the	mistress	of	diana	's	grove	a	beautiful	woman	of	aristocratic	birth		
it	must	be	borne	in	mind	that	he	thought	that	the	heavy	trunk	was	full	of	valuables	and	that	he	believed	that	lady	arabella	had	come	to	try	to	steal	it		
so	it	was	with	edgar	caswall	despite	his	selfish	nature	and	coldness	of	blood		
let	nothing	take	your	attention	from	mimi	and	you	will	win		
it	seemed	at	first	quite	still	but	presently	when	adam	's	eye	became	accustomed	to	it	he	could	see	that	it	moved	as	if	trembling		
i	am	willing	to	run	the	riskfor	i	take	it	there	would	be	no	slight	risk	in	the	doing		
then	my	dear	adam	i	need	not	wait	to	offer	congratulations		
she	looked	as	she	felt	ill	and	weak		
that	was	proved	in	new	york		
he	woke	in	the	morning	at	daylight	and	resumed	his	patient	but	unavailing	study	of	the	metal	trunk		
they	have	all	a	great	regard	for	my	uncle		
the	only	thing	that	they	heard	of	her	birth	was	that	her	name	was	mimi		
he	made	examination	of	the	contents	but	came	to	the	conclusion	that	the	glass	objects	were	unsuitable		
a	servant	came	into	the	room	to	tell	adam	that	there	was	some	strange	noise	coming	from	the	locked	room	into	which	he	had	gone	when	he	came	in		
it	so	filled	her	with	fear	that	she	had	a	haunting	feeling	that	she	would	as	soon	die	as	live		
		
too	early	to	give	in	my	boy		
in	order	to	accumulate	the	necessary	amount	of	fine	seasand	he	ordered	the	steward	to	prepare	for	an	elaborate	system	of	topdressing	all	the	grounds		
i	wanted	especially	to	talk	with	you	tonight	for	i	can	not	help	thinking	that	the	time	is	fast	comingif	it	has	not	come	alreadywhen	we	must	take	your	uncle	into	our	confidence		
she	is	a	good	girlas	good	as	she	is	pretty		
adam	was	gathering	the	tools	which	he	had	been	usingwhich	after	the	manner	of	all	workmen	had	been	scattered	aboutwhen	he	noticed	that	several	black	snakes	had	crawled	out	from	the	heap	of	stones	and	were	gathering	round	him		
sir	nathaniel	who	was	writing	at	a	table	near	the	window	looked	up		
this	time	it	was	by	lady	arabella	walking	hurriedly	and	so	furiously	angry	that	she	did	not	recognise	him	even	to	the	extent	of	acknowledging	his	bow		
all	at	once	she	turned	round	threw	up	her	hands	and	fell	down	in	a	faint		
things	have	changed	since	we	agreed	to	keep	him	out	of	the	trouble		
i	would	n't	for	all	the	world	wrong	such	a	young	lady	more	especial	when	she	has	such	a	cruel	weight	to	bear		
i	asked	feeling	that	my	question	was	a	feeble	one		
then	she	laid	my	hand	down	gently	but	quickly	and	said	to	me	and	to	sergeant	daw	come	to	my	room		
all	night	the	patient	remained	in	his	trance		
he	laid	the	paper	on	his	palm	and	with	a	simple	pardon	me		
mr.	trelawny	took	a	long	breath	and	in	a	more	cheerful	as	well	as	in	a	more	decided	tone	went	on	as	we	are	all	of	one	mind	the	sooner	we	get	the	necessary	matters	in	train	the	better		
this	however	is	on	the	road	to	rectification		
he	forgot	his	reserve	and	in	his	indignation	poured	forth	a	torrent	of	almost	incoherent	but	enlightening	broken	sentences	identify		
anyhow	it	is	done	now	and	ca	n't	be	undone		
we	know	as	yet	so	little	of	natural	forces	that	imagination	need	set	no	bounds	to	its	flights	in	considering	the	possibilities	of	the	future		
these	had	not	been	used	to	preserve	the	intestines	as	usual	so	they	must	have	been	placed	there	for	some	other	purpose		
the	rigidity	of	her	limbs	is	less	and	her	skin	seems	more	sensitiveor	perhaps	i	should	say	less	insensitiveto	pain		
i	asked	the	nurse	if	she	wanted	anything		
she	had	been	standing	quite	still	at	one	side	of	the	cave	leaning	on	a	sarcophagus	in	one	of	those	fits	of	abstraction	which	had	of	late	come	upon	her	but	on	hearing	the	sound	and	seeing	silvio	's	violent	onslaught	she	seemed	to	fall	into	a	positive	fury	of	passion		
we	searched	everywhere	around	and	dug	up	the	sand	which	had	piled	around	us	but	in	vain		
little	however	of	a	marked	nature	transpired	during	the	journey		
there	were	too	many	suspicious	circumstances	to	warrant	this	now	that	my	attention	was	fixed	on	it	and	my	intelligence	recognised	the	possibility		
a	clock	ticked	on	the	landing	other	clocks	in	the	house	ticked	the	life	of	the	city	without	manifested	itself	in	the	distant	hum	now	and	again	swelling	into	a	roar	as	a	breeze	floating	westward	took	the	concourse	of	sounds	with	it		
his	device	of	fastening	the	key	to	his	wrist	by	a	steel	bangle	though	successful	in	the	end	had	wellnigh	cost	him	his	life		
we	might	have	known	that	the	maker	of	such	a	tomba	woman	who	had	shown	in	other	ways	such	a	sense	of	beauty	and	completeness	and	who	had	finished	every	detail	with	a	feminine	richness	of	elaborationwould	not	have	neglected	such	an	architectural	feature		
that	theft	with	all	that	followed	proved	to	us	one	thing	however	that	each	part	of	her	body	though	separated	from	the	rest	can	be	a	central	point	or	rallying	place	for	the	items	or	particles	of	her	astral	body		
mr.	corbeck	answered	at	once	secrecy	is	everything		
who	was	this	new	radiant	being	who	had	won	to	existence	out	of	the	mist	and	darkness	of	our	fears		
i	nodded	and	waited	 	he	went	on	 	you	know	that	that	room	where	they	were	found	opens	directly	into	the	room	where	miss	trelawny	slept	last	night		
the	inscription	on	the	mummy	cat	in	mr.	trelawny	's	room		
i	wo	n't	feel	so	heavyheaded	when	i	get	out	of	this	mummy	smell		
did	it	strike	any	of	you	in	thinking	of	the	late	events	who	or	what	her	familiar	was		
without	a	word	she	raised	her	right	hand	so	that	the	bracelet	of	spreading	wings	which	covered	the	wrist	fell	back	leaving	the	flesh	bare		
then	this	is	the	twentieth	of	july		
in	such	case	full	examination	would	have	to	be	made	into	everything	as	it	stands	the	police	evidence	would	show	a	murderous	attack	more	than	once	repeated		
the	liquefaction	of	oxygen	the	existence	of	radium	of	helium	of	polonium	of	argon	the	different	powers	of	roentgen	and	cathode	and	bequerel	rays		
there	is	a	good	deal	of	such	work	done	still	and	in	other	places	than	brum		
i	have	however	already	faced	very	great	dangers	and	of	an	unknown	kind	and	so	has	that	brave	scholar	who	has	helped	me	in	the	work		
i	was	hurrying	away	to	carry	out	his	wishes	when	however	my	hand	was	on	the	key	of	the	door	his	voice	recalled	me	mr.		
there	was	over	me	a	conviction	of	security	which	was	absolute	and	supreme		
he	tore	out	the	paper	and	handed	it	to	her		
miss	trelawny	looked	glad	and	sent	word	to	mrs.	grant	to	get	a	room	ready	for	him		
what	other	forces	were	arrayed		
it	was	the	3rd	of	november	1884	when	we	entered	the	mummy	pit	for	the	second	time	we	had	reason	to	remember	the	date		
there	could	be	no	possible	mistake	as	to	this	in	the	mind	of	anyone	who	had	ever	noted	the	constellation		
		
treasures	priceless	in	themselves	but	doubly	precious	to	him	by	whose	wishes	and	instructions	i	sought	them		
then	an	icy	chill	shot	through	me		
i	touched	the	hand	and	moved	it	the	arm	being	something	flexible	as	a	live	arm	though	stiff	with	long	disuse	as	are	the	arms	of	those	faqueers	which	i	have	seen	in	the	indees		
there	is	an	unconscious	attitude	or	bearing	to	persons	in	new	surroundings	which	there	is	no	mistaking		
and	that		
i	took	it	to	be	some	unique	motherstone	or	matrix	of	some	gem		
see		
this	phase	i	could	not	get	rid	of	so	easily	as	the	last	the	fibres	of	my	being	remained	quiet		
i	said	strange		
i	must	have	been	bitten	by	some	powerful	scarab	for	i	took	it	bad		
he	began	at	once	i	have	gone	over	this	case	sir	till	my	brain	begins	to	reel	but	i	ca	n't	find	any	ordinary	solution	of	it		
i	cried		
we	were	both	struck	by	the	description	of	the	lonely	tomb	in	the	rock	cut	so	high	up	as	to	be	inaccessible	to	ordinary	seekers	 	with	all	means	of	reaching	it	carefully	obliterated	and	yet	with	such	an	elaborate	ornamentation	of	the	smoothed	surface	of	the	cliff	as	van	huyn	has	described		
there	was	but	one	episode	which	had	in	it	any	element	of	alarm	but	as	we	were	all	asleep	at	the	time	it	did	not	disturb	us		
above	it	was	a	pulley	and	a	mass	of	strong	tackle	with	multiplying	blocks	of	the	smeaton	order		
he	did	not	like	the	seeming	harshness	of	his	words	however	for	he	added	i	do	hope	miss	trelawny	that	you	understand	that	i	am	willingfrankly	and	unequivocally	willingto	do	anything	i	can	within	the	limits	of	my	power	to	relieve	your	distress		
for	a	while	i	sat	quiet	my	heart	beating		
the	night	went	by	so	quickly	that	the	dawn	seemed	to	rush	on	me	not	stealing	as	is	its	wo	nt		
certainly	we	had	no	fear	of	such	danger	from	violence	as	we	had	had	to	guard	against	in	london	during	mr.	trelawny	's	long	trance		
here	are	the	transcripts	from	the	chapel	at	the	south	and	the	east		
this	by	the	way	was	not	an	isolated	belief	in	egyptian	history	but	was	different	in	its	cause		
we	left	the	dead	arabs	where	they	lay		
my	heart	began	to	beat	wildly		
it	was	probably	her	knowledge	of	my	being	a	lawyer	which	first	determined	her	to	ask	me	to	come	when	she	thought	you	had	been	murdered		
you	are	your	father	's	daughter		
whereas	if	powers	it	had	they	were	not	for	him	who	had	taken	it	from	the	dead	since	his	death	followed	hard	upon	his	theft		
but	his	annoyance	and	excitement	had	not	disappeared	quite	enough	remained	to	cover	up	any	such	secondary	and	purely	exoteric	feeling	as	surprise		
for	a	while	she	sat	making	some	notes	or	memoranda		
god	knows		
the	plough	was	high	in	the	heavens	and	both	its	stars	and	the	pole	star	were	straight	opposite	the	window		
and	then	the	deep	eyes	filled	up	with	unshed	tears	of	great	emotion		
as	he	spoke	she	continued	to	hold	it		
the	arabs	were	surprised	when	we	retraced	our	steps	and	some	of	them	were	not	satisfied		
it	was	not	till	we	stood	together	at	the	foot	of	the	shaft	that	the	thought	flashed	across	me	that	we	might	be	in	some	sort	of	a	trap	that	someone	might	descend	the	rope	from	the	cliff	and	by	cutting	the	rope	by	which	we	had	lowered	ourselves	into	the	pit	bury	us	there	alive		
mr.	trelawny	smiled	over	at	him		
here	i	quietly	put	it	on	and	made	myself	comfortable		
we	ought	to	have	laughed	but	we	did	n't		
she	smiled	at	her	father	approvingly	as	she	said	you	are	right	father		
i	submitted	forthwith	he	began	to	dress	my	hand		
so	i	drew	near	silently	and	saw	that	it	was	none	other	than	the	white	hand	of	the	mummy	which	had	lain	protecting	the	jewel	in	the	great	sarcophagus		
we	were	to	share	the	duty	at	the	early	hours	of	the	morning		
i	repeated	the	resurrection	of	the	woman	and	the	woman	's	life
