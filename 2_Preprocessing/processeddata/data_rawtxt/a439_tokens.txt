and	she	presented	the	bride	with	a	silver	basket	fit	either	for	flowers	or	fruit	and	containing	a	very	neat	cheque	for	a	hundred	guineas		
but	he	is	one	of	the	first	boxers	in	england		
it	is	as	soft	as	milk	no	not	a	drop		
a	tender	remembrance		
you	have	broken	contract	and	if	you	were	one	of	my	workmen	i	would	pay	you	nothing		
nobody	can	explain	such	things	nobody	can	explain	anything	my	uncle	replied	with	his	usual	wisdom	look	at	me		
she	was	tall	and	straight	and	of	goodly	presence	with	fine	large	features	and	a	steadfast	look	which	expressed	clear	perception	and	strong	resolve	but	less	violence	of	nature	than	her	sister	showed		
believe	no	man	dead	till	he	comes	and	proves	it.’	but	women	can	always	believe	what	they	wish		
which	i	do	pretty	sharp	as	he	knows	to	his	credit		
and	like	the	great	bulk	of	such	people	again	he	was	truly	consistent	in	his	own	freedom	from	any	loftier	motives		
only	half	a	pint	each	for	the	women	mind		
they	fell	among	the	furze	and	got	patterns	on	their	faces	and	showed	no	gratitude	to	nature	for	one	of	her	best	gifts		
but	about	three	days	of	it	that	’s	all	there	is		
in	the	calm	may	night	i	left	my	desolate	home	to	learn	the	cause	and	meaning	of	its	desolation		
do	n’t	blame	yourself	or	her		
go	and	lie	down	kit	do	n’t	you	see	you	are	in	the	way		
i	’ll	give	you	any	undertaking	you	think	fit		
now	all	was	calm	and	sunny	silence	broken	only	by	the	lapping	of	the	brook		
the	doctor	has	been	ordering	him	change	of	air	and	at	last	i	persuaded	him	to	go		
you	spoke	very	harshly	to	her	i	know		
how	much	have	you	won	kit		
and	the	sweetest	girl	in	london	too	without	any	cheek	or	high	faluting		
then	i	asked	her	with	my	wrath	turning	into	jealous	pangs	about	that	old	villain	who	had	dared	to	imagine	that	his	wealth	if	he	had	any	or	at	any	rate	his	position	could	bridge	over	the	gulf	between	virtue	and	vice	loveliness	and	ugliness	sweet	maidenhood	and	sour	decrepitude	of	bad	living		
but	if	you	could	bring	yourself	without	feeling	it	too	much	to	tell	me	how	that	matter	was	it	would	be	a	great	satisfaction	to	me	and	do	me	a	lot	of	good	i	do	believe	well	my	boy	it	is	a	frosty	night		
sergeant	biggs	does	not	think	much	of	himself	but	sunbury	does	and	it	would	stare	to	see	him	go	on	duty	without	any	waistcoat	or	stock	or	even	a	pair	of	braces	on		
but	i	whistled	a	tune	and	went	cheerfully	along	for	the	night	was	beautiful	and	the	trees	still	piled	with	blossom	rose	against	the	starry	sky	like	cones	of	snow		
that	was	n’t	arkerate	you	know		
but	my	spirit	rose	and	i	jumped	up	and	faced	him		
and	i	was	pleased	that	he	did	not	in	any	way	attempt	to	talk	goody	as	our	people	call	it	nor	even	refer	to	my	lonely	condition	though	i	knew	by	the	softness	of	his	manner	that	it	was	present	to	his	mind		
you	have	seen	that	i	always	take	your	part	when	people	go	to	bully	you		
tonks	has	been	with	him	a	deal	too	much		
why	she	’ll	want	to	be	dining	with	us	the	next	thing		
but	that	sounds	like	the	frontdoor	bell		
there	were	three	cabs	or	flies	as	they	called	them	there	waiting	in	the	station	yard	for	it	is	their	busiest	time	of	the	day	and	he	chose	clipson	’s	because	the	horse	looked	freshest	and	told	him	to	drive	to	shepperton	without	saying	a	word	about	the	fare		
mrs.	wilcox	received	me	very	kindly	and	i	was	glad	to	find	her	business	thriving	and	the	sharp	boy	released	from	the	pots	and	growing	very	useful	at	the	counter		
consider	what	a	lot	of	that	i	shall	have	from	the	mother	you	can	stand	anything	said	the	other	with	a	sigh	but	i	am	not	as	tough	as	i	used	to	be	and	a	row	in	the	papers	brings	the	duns	in	by	the	dozen		
none		
i	must	leave	you	to	the	light	of	nature	although	he	is	rather	a	dark	specimen		
i	am	pretty	tough	but	it	would	have	killed	me	although	i	am	no	chatterbox		
then	the	master	of	the	house	appeared	and	shook	hands	with	sam	and	bowed	to	me		
being	equally	urged	by	love	and	strong	distrust	of	coming	dangers	i	did	not	lose	a	single	day	but	wrote	to	miss	parslow	by	the	very	next	post	because	she	required	and	indeed	deserved	to	have	a	voice	in	all	we	did		
perhaps	she	was	thinking	of	her	own	lovetime	which	would	rouse	at	once	pity	for	me	and	illwill	towards	the	sister	who	then	had	wronged	her	so		
altogether	he	was	worth	about	twenty	thousand	pounds	which	he	justly	intended	for	his	only	child		
but	you	are	below	my	contempt	and	i	wonder	that	i	even	deign	to	speak	to	you		
we	have	never	had	a	single	word		
then	he	cut	a	caper	round	my	feet	and	with	the	innumerable	laughter	of	his	tail	fell	fawning	and	begged	but	a	word	from	me		
then	we	’ll	have	tilbury	from	hampton	to	see	to	the	papering	and	painting	and	all	that		
that	makes	all	the	difference		
glad	to	see	you	sir	at	any	time	and	if	i	should	happen	to	be	about	the	grounds	my	nephew	kit	will	see	to	everything	you	want		
in	short	he	looked	more	like	a	gentleman	than	i	had	ever	known	him	look	before	and	seeing	what	a	fine	young	man	he	was	i	felt	heartily	glad	that	he	had	fixed	his	affections	where	they	could	not	imperil	mine		
it	ought	to	have	been	locked	as	well	of	course	as	tabby	tapscott	who	had	the	true	feminine	knack	of	hitting	a	blot	observed		
you	shall	thank	me	as	much	as	ever	you	like	when	you	have	got	your	kitty	back	again		
well	there	are	fools	in	this	world		
then	i	gave	up	calling	kitty	as	i	had	been	doing	all	along	till	i	ran	upstairs	to	our	pretty	bedroom	and	there	i	called	for	her	once	more		
run	as	far	as	widow	cutthumb	’s	and	fetch	half	a	dozen	eggs		
now	he	wrote	to	my	aunt	that	i	was	coming	according	to	her	proposal	and	he	made	tabby	tapscott	come	up	to	the	cottage	and	pack	up	a	few	things	for	me	inasmuch	as	i	had	no	one	now	to	do	it		
it	would	never	do	to	have	a	row	with	him	and	to	take	him	by	the	throat	as	he	deserves		
let	us	go	to	him	while	he	is	by	himself		
they	might	just	as	well	blame	a	dog	for	loving	liver	or	a	cat	for	believing	that	heaven	is	milk	as	fall	foul	of	my	uncle	corny	because	he	ate	the	onions	of	very	common	jokes		
i	dare	say	you	are	surprised	such	things	are	not	done	down	at	sunbury		
the	great	thing	you	want	is	nourishment	she	said	when	i	had	made	a	noble	dinner	people	in	the	present	age	never	attach	sufficient	importance	to	that	point		
it	is	easy	enough	to	introduce	a	stranger	so	that	his	name	shall	be	still	unknown	and	sir	cumberleigh	not	being	quick	of	hearing	received	my	name	as	johnson	on	the	turf	he	inquired	and	sam	said	yes	he	has	been	on	it	every	day	this	week	which	was	true	enough	in	one	sense	and	i	longed	to	be	back	in	a	garden	again	where	we	grow	rogues	but	nothing	like	so	many		
one	was	sir	cumberance	hotchpots	or	some	such	name	proving	to	be	a	wicked	man	from	the	north	and	the	other	was	her	brother	as	ought	to	be	all	over	according	to	the	flesh	of	marriage	sir		
now	look	sharp	exclaimed	uncle	corny	who	was	not	at	all	concerned	with	nature	’s	doings	except	as	they	concerned	his	pocket		
but	for	the	good	of	others	i	was	forced	to	put	these	fancies	by	for	we	could	not	have	found	another	spot	so	suitable	for	the	poor	sick	child		
what	had	he	lost		
but	you	say	that	he	is	ill	that	he	has	long	been	ill	and	perhaps	he	will	never	be	well	any	more		
to	make	up	for	the	want	of	other	faults	she	has	that	one	to	an	extreme	you	see		
by	these	he	was	soon	so	swung	about	and	almost	carried	under	that	the	sandhills	where	the	people	stood	to	watch	him	stood	still	themselves	instead	of	slowly	gliding	by		
at	first	i	was	uneasy	for	if	kitty	were	to	catch	that	complaint	after	all	her	other	troubles	was	she	likely	to	look	well	upon	the	bridal	day		
but	i	am	sure	you	will	admit	that	i	am	reason	itself	in	asking	you	one	or	two	little	questions		
such	a	man	of	his	word	never	lived	i	do	believe		
but	peartrees	have	been	so	times	out	of	mind	though	never	none	but	the	younger	ones		
he	was	too	wide	awake	for	that		
this	rose	i	cut	with	the	tender	touch	which	a	gardener	uses	boldly	and	laid	it	on	my	drawingblock	so	that	each	exquisite	tinge	and	fringe	and	curve	of	radiant	leaflet	as	well	as	the	swanlike	bend	of	stalk	and	soft	retirement	of	sepal	led	up	to	the	crowning	beauty	of	the	bloom	above	them		
kit	has	had	everything	regardless	of	expense	that	our	skilful	dr.	sippets	recommended	him		
kit	is	so	kind	and	gentle	to	me		
all	was	going	on	quite	as	well	as	i	could	wish	and	old	robert	woodbridge	was	quite	coming	round	to	the	coaxing	of	his	lovely	daughter	and	the	banns	were	to	be	put	up	just	before	the	grass	was	cut	so	that	we	might	have	our	weddingday	between	the	hay	and	wheat	when	suddenly	everything	was	thrown	abroad	and	both	our	lives	were	spoilt	for	ever		
however	that	sort	of	thing	was	out	of	harker	’s	line	and	i	asked	him	a	few	questions	with	a	sovereign	in	my	hand	at	which	he	kept	glancing	as	a	dog	of	better	manners	assures	his	master	that	he	loves	the	hand	ever	so	much	more	than	the	titbit	inside	it		
let	me	see	may	the	fourteenth	is	n’t	it	no	biggs	no		
i	have	a	right	to	ask	as	she	is	in	my	charge		
wants	to	wash	his	mouth	out		
ah	that	ought	to	bring	him	out		
however	in	one	way	he	showed	good	sense		
supposing	she	gets	no	letter	by	tomorrownight	what	comes	of	it	why	a	very	great	deal		
by	the	side	of	the	lane	an	old	oaktrunk	stretched	high	above	the	dip	and	furnished	with	a	broken	handrail	showed	that	there	must	have	been	something	to	cross	though	nobody	now	could	remember	it		
it	is	such	a	fine	thing		
but	let	her	get	a	letter	from	master	hilaryand	you	would	see	what	would	come	over	her	i	have	got	it		
this	was	not	like	hilary		
but	do	what	he	might	he	could	only	cut	a	poor	and	sorry	figure	and	looking	in	the	glass	he	was	frightened	at	his	wan	and	worn	appearance		
and	so	did	the	count	and	everybody		
love	however	warm	and	faithful	is	all	the	better	for	a	good	clear	fire	ere	ever	the	snowdrops	begin	to	spring		
but	you	shall	be	obeyed	beloved	one		
my	father	has	a	bad	headache	today		
here	was	the	place	and	time	for	a	man	to	sit	in	the	midst	of	his	garden	and	feel	that	the	year	was	not	gone	in	vain	nor	his	date	of	life	lessened	fruitlessly	and	looking	round	with	right	good	will	thank	the	lord	and	remember	his	father		
they	have	given	me	no	chance	of	trying		
sure	enough	now	try	on	fridaysmarketday	as	i	am	a	man	well	now	to	think	of	that	said	elias	what	a	fool	i	must	have	been	to	keep	on	so	with	saturday		
we	are	all	so	scattered	about	that	no	man	has	his	own	officer	near	him	and	he	do	n’t	care	a	button	for	any	others		
but	you	have	plenty	of	pride	now	have	n’t	you	ii	do	n’t	know	at	all	i	am	sure	but	i	suppose	i	am	the	same	as	other	girls	if	you	thought	that	lorraine	was	unworthy	of	you	you	could	make	up	your	mind	to	forget	him	i	hope	i	never	could	do	such	a	thing	because	i	never	dream	it	of	hilary		
whatever	my	sport	is	i	shall	call	in	and	thank	you	when	i	come	back	for	my	pony		
i	beg	your	pardon		
i	can	not	imagine	what	he	could	mean		
but	you	never	were	famous	for	good	manners	if	i	meddle	with	them	again	thought	gregory	may	i	be	adorned,’	as	my	father	says		
but	she	loved	him	all	the	more	for	that	and	being	herself	of	a	stronger	will	had	grown	without	any	sense	thereof	into	a	needful	championship	and	vigilance	for	his	good	repute		
behind	him	and	strapped	to	his	saddle	he	bore	what	used	to	be	called	a	vady	that	is	to	say	a	small	leather	cylinder	containing	change	of	raiment	and	other	small	comforts	of	the	traveller		
the	vanity	of	men	surpasses	even	the	love	of	women		
from	time	to	time	she	looked	and	listened	for	her	father	’s	galloway	and	the	heavy	content	of	the	summer	night	shed	gentle	patience	round	her		
also	she	would	let	him	know	one	thing		
she	felt	that	this	money	would	do	more	good	as	the	property	of	the	partidas	than	as	the	pay	of	the	british	troops		
i	knew	    	and	my	sister	also	knew	that	your	father	could	not	be	expected	    	to	like	it	or	allow	it	for	a	very	long	time	to	come		
only	think	how	we	should	feel	lorraine	if	our	own	daughters	were	exposed	so	i	have	n’t	got	any	daughters	said	hilary	groaning	with	pain	perhaps	at	the	thought		
being	now	in	a	calmer	state	of	mind	she	took	from	her	desk	a	tress	of	long	hair	the	most	valued	of	all	her	treasures		
poor	hilary		
it	was	not	in	her	nature	to	pretend	to	deceive	anybody	and	she	found	it	harder	from	day	to	day	to	be	right	in	all	their	trifles		
and	i	should	have	the	nettles	then		
an	unwelcome	escort		
to	send	him	out	in	a	nasty	sandy	ship	when	his	birth	were	to	go	on	horseback	the	same	as	all	the	gentlefolks	do	to	the	wars	but	mrs.	merryjack	you	forget	explained	the	accomplished	trotman	that	great	britain	is	a	hisland	ma’am		
my	blood	is	blue	because	i	have	    	no	breeches,’	says	one	of	their	poets	feelingly	and	that	is	    	the	case	with	all	of	them		
but	how	is	your	very	grand	wedding	to	be		
the	solicitors	would	be	directed	to	waive	the	obvious	objections	which	might	lead	to	mischief	or	might	not	according	to	circumstances		
you	call	it	a	bottlegreen’		
mabel	mab	all	out	here	alone	and	trying	to	hide	from	her	own	brother	gregory	jumped	from	his	horse	and	caught	her	and	even	in	the	waning	light	was	frightened	as	she	looked	at	him		
covering	the	ground	at	an	active	pace	and	crossing	the	woeburn	by	a	treebridge	rudely	set	up	where	the	old	one	had	been	he	strode	through	west	lorraine	and	steyning	and	over	the	hills	to	pyecombe	corner	where	he	took	the	reigate	coach	and	he	slept	that	night	at	reigate		
why	nobody	wants	to	poison	thee	i	think	sir	i	saw	your	daughter	go	round	the	corner	by	the	warmingpan	this	side	of	where	the	broom	hangs	then	all	i	can	say	is	she	is	daft		
i	hope	you	have	not	taken	anything	likely	to	disagree	with	you		
perhaps	the	expression	had	passed	away	while	the	substance	settled	inwards	but	however	that	may	have	been	her	face	was	pleasant	calm	and	gentle		
perhaps	she	even	enjoyed	it	a	little		
this	he	placed	on	a	chair	and	without	any	mystery	unlocked	it		
the	moorish	origin	here	and	there	was	boldly	manifest	among	spanish	french	and	italian	handiwork	both	of	repair	and	enlargement		
this	day	she	allowed	the	groom	to	chase	her	like	the	black	care	that	sits	behind	until	she	had	taken	free	burst	of	the	hills	and	longed	to	see	things	quietly		
therefore	i	will	say	good	evening.’	chapter	xxxvii		
for	suddenly	he	was	surprised	by	a	most	disagreeable	sense	of	grittiness	and	then	a	keen	stab	in	the	roof	of	his	mouth		
with	all	the	contempt	that	can	be	expressed	by	silence	when	speech	is	expected	she	kept	on	so	briskly	towards	bonny	’s	castle	that	her	suitor	who	in	spite	of	all	martial	bearing	walked	in	the	manner	of	a	pigeon	became	hard	set	to	keep	up	with	her		
the	spanish	officers	took	to	him	kindly	and	so	did	the	soldiers	and	even	the	mules		
he	had	not	invested	his	mind	as	yet	in	implicit	faith	in	anything	but	rather	was	inclined	to	be	tolerant	and	tentative	and	diffident	of	his	own	opinions		
well	you	have	me	at	your	mercy	mabel		
there	are	many	obstructions	no	doubt	in	its	course	and	many	hollow	places	to	fill	up		
in	this	condition	of	the	gloomy	air	and	just	when	frost	was	hovering	in	the	grey	clouds	before	striking	alice	lorraine	came	into	her	father	’s	bookroom	on	the	christmaseve		
now	run	up	and	see	whether	your	poor	cousin	has	eaten	that	morsel	of	anchovy	toast		
but	missie	slips	away	so	quick	like	i	never	can	get	hold	of	her		
one	was	the	character	of	sir	roland	the	other	was	the	english	courage	and	norman	spirit	of	alice		
he	had	been	instructed	to	tie	tight	and	he	was	pleased	to	show	now	how	tight	he	had	tied	after	his	own	remonstrance		
phyllis	was	often	of	a	pensive	cast	and	she	never	looked	better	than	in	this	mood	when	she	felt	the	deepest	need	of	sympathy		
sir	roland	also	was	becoming	more	and	more	reserved	and	meditative		
at	the	ford	however	there	was	no	sign	of	any	british	detachment	and	the	trumpeters	sounded	a	flourish	in	vain		
however	your	father	as	was	right	and	natural	on	his	part	felt	a	convictionas	those	low	methodists	are	always	saying	of	themselvesthat	there	would	be	a	hundred	thousand	pounds	to	help	him	in	what	he	was	thinking	of		
shot	come	to	heel	this	moment	you	are	right	said	the	captain	i	shall	do	the	same		
and	three	weeks	still	is	a	long	spell	of	time	for	the	young	to	anticipate	misery		
but	about	this	moneybag	she	saidis	that	what	you	ask	sir	roland		
i	am	sure	that	you	know	what	it	is	about		
what	is	the	use	of	it	if	i	am		
she	ought	to	have	a	little	more	of	wisdom		
senhor	is	not	that	enough		
for	his	mind	was	set	out	upon	a	track	of	thought	which	it	might	have	pursued	until	dinnertime		
the	suitor	favoured	by	mrs.	lovejoy	was	a	young	physician	at	maidstone	dr.	daniel	calvert	a	man	of	good	birth	and	connections	and	having	prospects	of	good	fortune		
i	am	quite	out	of	breath	with	my	long	translation	and	i	am	not	quite	sure	of	all	of	it		
it	is	too	great	a	risk	to	run	well	my	dear	mother	i	must	confess	that	your	scheme	is	a	very	fine	one		
betwixt	herself	and	her	grandmother	there	was	little	love	lost	and	still	less	kept	for	each	looked	down	upon	the	other	from	the	heights	of	impartial	duty		
not	that	i	blames	un	for	what	a	ca	n’t	help		
but	come	now	and	sit	in	this	chair	and	tell	me	if	you	please	sir	remnant	how	the	poor	things	are	getting	onyour	captain	and	my	poor	grandchild	well	madam	i	need	not	tell	a	lady	of	your	high	breeding	and	experience	the	maids	of	the	present	day	are	not	at	all	the	same	thing	as	they	used	to	be		
so	that	he	was	one	of	the	everdwindling	class	of	franklins	a	class	that	has	done	good	work	for	england	neither	obtaining	nor	craving	thanks		
but	we’m	all	right	howsomever	it	be		
a	filthy	old	tobaccopipe	and	nothing	elseno	change	whatever		
old	applewood	farm	was	just	taking	it	easy	in	the	betwixt	and	between	of	hard	work		
this	steel	thing	is	so	rusty	that	it	fills	my	work	with	canker		
but	now	the	birds	that	were	come	among	them	meant	to	have	them	wholesale
