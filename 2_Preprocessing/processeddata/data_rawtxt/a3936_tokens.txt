his	shiny	wheels	and	the	pretty	yellow	wheels	of	the	red	wagon	creaked	so	loudly	none	of	the	dolls	heard	the	cries	of	the	tiny	penny	dolls	who	were	too	small	to	climb	aboard		
cuckoo		
then	they	went	back	to	the	position	each	had	been	in	when	marcella	had	left	them		
he	added		
as	it	began	to	freeze		
he	ran	down	behind	the	shed	and	through	the	garden	and	then	back	towards	the	house	again		
i	believe	raggedy	andy	must	have	a	candy	heart	too	like	raggedy	ann		
raggedy	andy	and	uncle	clem	stood	looking	out	of	the	door	the	rest	of	the	dolls	peeping	over	their	shoulders	so	when	something	came	jumping	through	the	door	it	hit	uncle	clem	and	raggedy	andy	and	sent	them	flying	against	the	other	dolls	behind	them		
then	knowing	the	folks	might	soon	be	astir	the	dolls	left	off	their	playing	and	all	took	the	same	positions	they	had	been	in	when	marcella	left	them	the	night	before		
there		
just	see	here		
perhaps	we	had	best	try	to	wash	your	face		
raggedy	andy	and	raggedy	ann	walked	over	to	a	corner	of	the	nursery	and	thought	and	thought		
raggedy	andy	intended	jumping	down	the	stairs	head	over	heels	for	he	knew	that	neither	he	uncle	clem	nor	henny	would	break	anything	by	jumping	down	stairs		
he	could	neither	go	down	nor	come	back	up		
were	you	wet	most	of	the	time	raggedy	andy		
then	just	as	a	little	boy	and	a	little	girl	who	looked	as	though	they	did	not	ever	have	much	candy	passed	the	house	the	dolls	all	gave	a	push	and	sent	the	bag	tumbling	to	the	sidewalk		
that	will	be	loads	of	fun		
and	raggedy	andy	lay	upon	the	floor	of	the	nursery	and	showed	the	dollies	just	how	it	was	done		
ha		
we	take	sugar	and	water	and	butter	and	a	little	vinegar	and	put	it	all	on	the	stove	to	cook		
he	should	not	come	scratching	around	our	house	if	he	does	n't	care	to	be	chased		
two	little	chicadees	came	and	sat	upon	the	sled	and	talked	to	me	in	their	cute	little	bird	language	and	i	watched	the	sky	in	the	west	get	golden	red	then	turn	into	a	deep	crimson	purple	and	finally	a	deep	blue	as	the	sun	went	farther	down	around	the	bend	of	the	earth		
the	pretty	pond	was	covered	with	ice	too	and	upon	the	ice	was	a	soft	blanket	of	the	white	white	snow		
was	n't	it	lots	of	fun		
did	i	frisk	my	tail		
illustration	all	sitting	together	illustration	fido	in	a	basket	illustration	raggedy	andy	and	fido	the	rabbit	chase	well	what	shall	we	play	tonight		
after	it	had	been	dark	for	some	time	i	heard	someone	coming	through	the	snow	and	could	see	the	yellow	light	of	a	lantern		
it	's	good	to	be	back	home	again		
the	man	said	to	mama		
i	was	just	thinking	raggedy	ann	said	that	it	would	be	very	nice	to	have	the	taffy	pull	but	suppose	some	of	the	folks	smell	the	candy	while	it	is	cooking		
i	was	frozen	into	one	solid	cake	of	ice	all	the	way	through	and	when	marcella	tried	to	limber	up	my	arm	before	it	had	thawed	out	it	went	pop		
yes	it	was	full	of	easter	eggs	and	colored	grasses	for	the	little	girl	who	lives	here		
cried	all	the	dolls	when	they	saw	raggedy	andy	's	feat		
over	and	over	until	they	wound	up	laughing	at	the	bottom		
uncle	clem	went	to	the	waste	paper	basket	and	came	back	with	some	scraps	of	yellow	and	red	paper		
my	mistress	had	put	us	both	to	bed	for	the	night	and	if	she	had	discovered	us	way	up	in	the	attic	she	would	have	wondered	how	in	the	world	we	got	there		
she	won		
henny	always	said	mama	when	he	was	tilted	backward	or	forward	and	when	the	pillow	rolled	him	over	and	over	he	cried	mama	mama	mama		
the	wooden	horse	a	thrill	of	happiness	running	through	his	wooden	body	cried	it	is	the	most	fun	i	have	ever	had		
raggedy	andy	whispered	as	he	patted	the	two	little	penny	dolls	with	his	soft	rag	hands		
cuckoo		
yes	cried	susan	let	's	all	go	get	the	things	out	of	the	machine	drawer		
sighed	raggedy	ann		
said	uncle	clem	who	was	very	kind	and	loved	everybody	and	everything		
there	from	the	head	of	the	stairs	they	watched	the	cheery	little	whitewhiskered	man	take	pretty	things	from	a	large	sack	and	place	them	about	the	chimneyplace		
but	the	french	doll	had	a	lovely	mouth	for	taking	medicine	it	was	open	and	showed	her	teeth	in	a	dimpling	smile		
said	raggedy	andy	as	he	threw	the	arm	about	raggedy	ann	's	neck	and	gave	her	a	hug		
last	one	up	is	a	cocoa	baby		
i	wish	you	would		
uncle	clem	said		
the	medicine	which	was	given	the	dolls	had	great	curing	properties		
illustration	shaking	the	french	doll	upside	down	illustration	hole	in	her	head	laughingly	they	scrambled	to	their	feet	and	sat	the	french	doll	up	so	they	might	look	into	the	hole	in	the	top	of	her	head		
henny	did	not	see	the	pillow	coming	towards	him	so	he	was	knocked	head	over	heels		
asked	henny		
and	to	this	day	the	dollies	little	mistress	does	not	know	that	raggedy	andy	was	the	doctor	who	cured	the	french	doll	of	her	only	ill	illustration	raggedy	andy	dancing	with	the	french	doll	illustration	dickie	and	raggedy	andy	illustration	where	is	raggedy	andy	's	smile		
the	more	fun	we	can	give	each	other	the	more	fun	each	one	of	us	will	have		
dickie	would	have	been	sorry	too	if	he	had	been	more	than	two	years	old	but	when	one	is	only	two	years	old	he	has	very	few	sorrows		
dickie	's	only	sorrow	was	that	raggedy	andy	was	taken	from	him	and	he	could	not	feed	raggedy	andy	more	orange	juice		
raggedy	andy	again	wound	up	the	little	music	box	and	catching	the	french	doll	about	the	waist	started	a	rollicking	dance	which	lasted	until	the	roosters	in	the	neighborhood	began	their	morning	crowing		
when	the	children	had	passed	out	of	sight	the	dolls	climbed	down	from	the	window		
raggedy	andy	uncle	clem	and	henny	stopped	so	suddenly	they	fell	over	each	other	and	raggedy	andy	being	in	the	lead	and	pulling	the	other	two	slid	right	through	the	door	and	stopped	at	the	feet	of	the	man		
it	was	a	rather	tight	fit	but	raggedy	andy	wiggled	and	twisted	until	all	the	dolls	could	see	of	him	were	his	two	feet		
i	've	spent	so	much	of	my	time	while	i	was	away	drying	out	my	soft	cotton	stuffing	it	seems	as	though	it	has	almost	become	a	habit		
perhaps	i	did		
uncle	clem	twisted	and	wiggled	in	his	sleep	until	finally	he	could	stand	it	no	longer	and	awakened		
and	then	i	pulled	and	pulled	until	finally	his	feet	came	out	of	the	wheel	and	we	both	tumbled	to	the	floor		
if	that	is	the	case	we	can	have	the	taffy	pull	and	all	the	fun	that	goes	with	it		
cried	a	cheery	voice		
this	amused	henny	as	much	as	it	did	the	other	dolls	so	when	he	jumped	to	his	feet	he	laughed	and	threw	the	pillow	back	at	raggedy	andy		
the	dolls	all	laughed	at	this	for	they	knew	very	well	that	even	had	mama	been	awake	they	would	not	have	asked	her	for	needle	and	thread	because	they	did	not	wish	her	to	know	they	could	act	and	talk	just	like	real	people		
uncle	clem	said		
raggedy	ann	said		
some	of	you	must	have	left	shavings	or	something	in	the	eaves	and	it	has	washed	down	into	the	pipe	so	that	the	water	pours	over	the	gutter	in	sheets		
she	was	given	a	dose	every	minute	or	so		
raggedy	andy	was	just	about	to	climb	upon	the	horse	's	back	again	when	the	french	doll	leaped	there	herself	and	balancing	lightly	upon	one	foot	stood	in	this	position	while	the	wooden	horse	rolled	around	the	nursery	as	fast	as	he	could	go		
then	we	ran	downstairs	as	fast	as	we	could	and	climbed	into	bed	did	n't	we		
the	french	doll	was	sitting	quietly	in	one	of	the	little	red	chairs	smiling	the	prettiest	of	dimpling	smiles	at	raggedy	andy	and	thinking	of	the	romp	the	dolls	would	have	that	night	after	the	house	grew	quiet	when	marcella	discovered	that	the	french	doll	had	the	croup	and	put	her	to	bed		
leaning	out	he	could	look	along	the	new	shiny	tin	gutter	the	men	had	put	in	place		
raggedy	ann	said	when	uncle	clem	had	held	the	french	doll	in	this	position	for	five	minutes		
they	shook	her		
that	was	lots	of	fun		
said	raggedy	andy		
then	straightening	his	old	shoulders	and	pulling	his	hat	firmly	on	his	head	he	stooped	and	kissed	the	old	lady	and	walked	with	a	firm	tread	to	the	door		
everybody	called	the	two	cottages	the	twin	houses	for	another	reason	the	owners	were	twins		
johnny	cricket	said		
it	was	such	a	nice	happyhearted	note	sally	migrundy	said	i	will	answer	it		
willie	woodchuck	is	whittling	because	he	has	nothing	else	to	do		
i	have	never	enjoyed	myself	so	much	before	and	i	will	never	be	grumpy	and	be	called	a	grundy	again		
yes	but	matilda	her	sister	said	you	do	not	know	the	happiness	in	being	kind	and	friendly	to	others		
then	they	called	mamma	dorn	and	they	all	ate	some	of	the	ice	cream	and	candy		
then	she	took	three	long	deep	breaths	and	then	she	jumped	out	of	bed	quickly	right	on	her	toes		
have	you	seen	mrs.	thumbkins		
and	when	they	do	she	catches	them	by	the	heels	and	turns	everything	topsyturvy	all	day	long	but	when	you	get	out	of	bed	toes	first	i	'll	be	there	to	start	you	on	a	pleasant	day	and	witchy	crosspatch	will	have	to	return	to	makebelieve	land	and	hide	her	head		
cried	thumbkins		
finally	old	omasko	the	elk	came	down	to	the	river	to	feed	and	the	old	chief	catfish	swam	out	and	pulled	on	omasko	's	whiskers	and	all	the	other	catfish	cried	see	how	brave	and	fearless	the	mighty	catfish	are		
when	the	gnarled	tree	was	covered	with	leaves	in	the	summer	time	the	old	rough	stone	said	just	see	how	he	hides	the	blue	sky	from	my	view		
and	there	too	was	his	sister	as	she	had	been	when	a	child		
i	do	not	know		
in	the	middle	of	the	great	meadow	and	it	will	belong	to	the	one	who	finds	it	first		
one	contained	the	golden	pennies	another	the	candy	and	the	third	was	full	of	ice	cream		
i	will	buzz	down	that	way	and	see	him		
caaaaaw		
granny	asked	as	she	smiled	through	her	glasses	at	him		
he	cried	i	wish	the	gnarled	tree	would	come	back	and	scatter	his	leaves	about	me	to	protect	me	from	the	cold		
illustration	so	thumbkins	thanked	tommy	grasshopper	and	ran	over	to	granpa	tobacyworm	's	house		
the	box	is	full	of	candy	and	ice	cream		
do	n't	the	people	in	the	house	here	wish	good	luck		
as	he	did	so	the	figures	rose	in	the	air	and	seemed	to	grow	lighter	and	larger		
a	few	people	hesitated	as	they	passed	but	only	one	stopped		
granny	went	to	her	tiny	cupboard	and	brought	out	a	little	bottle	of	purple	fluid		
come	in		
when	the	little	nut	took	root	and	sent	its	tiny	shoots	up	in	the	air	the	old	rough	stone	said	there		
so	tommy	grasshopper	and	johnny	cricket	caught	hold	of	willy	ladybug	's	four	little	hands	and	helped	him	to	climb	up	the	tall	reeds	for	willy	was	not	as	old	as	the	other	bug	boys	and	might	fall	in	the	water	if	they	did	not	help	him		
flat	as	a	pancake		
oh	mamma	and	daddy		
as	the	little	old	man	finished	the	melody	he	stood	still	more	upright		
then	dickie	ran	home	as	fast	as	he	could	and	told	daddy	dorn		
oh	sister	katrinka	cried	as	she	tried	to	kiss	matilda		
so	the	people	never	called	granny	a	witch	after	that	for	they	knew	she	was	very	good	and	kindly		
and	all	the	other	objects	scarcely	breathed	while	they	watched	the	children	as	they	took	the	wishbone	from	the	shelf		
and	because	the	bottle	had	been	used	by	sally	migrundy	the	two	good	people	suddenly	knew	all	about	sally	migrundy	the	magic	little	cottage	and	the	happy	children	who	lived	there		
said	billy	bumblebee	as	he	made	his	wings	whirr	and	climbed	high	in	the	air		
a	mamma	meadowlark	sitting	upon	her	nest	saw	thumbkins	running	and	called	to	him	come	here	little	man	and	get	beneath	my	wing	and	i	will	keep	you	warm	and	dry		
all	was	quiet	within		
you	know	he	has	to	raise	his	head	every	onceinawhile	in	order	to	breathe	so	if	we	should	all	hang	on	to	him	we	could	pull	him	under	the	water		
then	though	it	was	raining	ever	so	hard	he	pulled	his	little	hat	well	down	on	his	head	and	ran	out	into	the	storm		
but	we	must	be	very	careful	and	not	fall	for	the	fish	would	soon	swallow	us	and	that	would	not	be	very	much	fun		
so	they	went	inside		
but	the	room	did	not	fill	with	candy		
illustration	am	i	to	take	it	granny		
but	when	they	got	inside	they	were	surprised	to	find	that	the	rooms	were	very	large		
one	night	while	matilda	sat	at	her	dark	window	looking	across	at	katrinka	's	house	she	saw	a	crowd	of	people	tiptoeing	up	to	the	stoop	with	baskets	under	their	arms	and	flowers	in	their	hands	and	when	all	had	crowded	upon	the	porch	they	stamped	their	feet	and	made	a	great	noise		
there	was	a	tiny	tinkle	from	a	bell	and	just	as	johnny	hopped	behind	the	clock	he	saw	a	boot	stick	out	of	the	fireplace		
billy	bumblebee	buzzed	closer	to	old	man	hoppytoad	's	head	and	old	man	hoppytoad	blinked	his	big	round	eyes	and	finally	said	she	is	locked	up	in	the	kitchen		
we	are	going	back	to	see	him		
tom	tom	cried	at	the	same	time	what	ever	has	happened	to	your	lovely	home	tim	tim		
then	shivering	himself	for	he	was	soaking	wet	he	ran	home	as	fast	as	he	could	took	off	his	dripping	clothes	put	on	his	little	pajamas	and	climbed	into	his	warm	little	cozy	cobweb	bed		
and	are	n't	you	very	cross	this	lovely	day		
cried	tilly	toad	as	she	stood	her	broom	in	the	corner	and	started	down	the	path		
when	dickie	took	a	seat	upon	a	tiny	sofa	he	did	not	know	just	how	to	ask	granny	for	what	he	wanted	so	he	twiddled	his	thumbs		
and	as	they	were	talking	there	came	a	noise	at	the	front	stoop		
the	light	from	the	lamp	was	too	dim	for	him	to	make	out	the	objects	hanging	from	the	mantel	above	the	fireplace		
he	laughed		
after	a	great	deal	of	coaxing	matilda	finally	agreed	that	she	would	change	places	with	katrinka	and	try	to	smile	when	anyone	came	to	see	her		
dickie	jumped	up	and	ran	down	the	hill	to	where	granny	lived		
all	the	children	of	the	little	village	loved	katrinka	for	she	always	had	a	cooky	or	a	dainty	in	her	apron	pocket	to	give	them	or	she	would	pat	them	on	their	curly	heads	and	smile	cheerily	at	them	through	her	glasses		
the	old	road	is	so	dreadfully	long	and	tiresome		
katrinka	replied		
of	course	all	the	bug	boys	knew	old	gran'pa	skeeterhawkfor	it	was	heso	the	three	returned	to	the	reed	and	sat	down	again	to	pass	the	time	of	day	with	gran'pa		
there	are	hundreds	of	children	just	like	you	who	make	hard	work	of	getting	up	when	they	are	called	in	the	morning	and	who	remain	cross	and	ugly	all	day	long		
thumbkins	cried	as	he	caught	old	man	hoppytoad	's	hand		
cried	a	cheery	voice	as	thumbkins	ran	under	a	bunch	of	flowers		
so	again	he	went	down	the	long	flights	of	stairs	and	down	the	street	until	he	came	to	a	good	corner	where	traffic	was	heavy		
from	his	hiding	place	johnny	cricket	heard	one	or	two	chuckles	and	something	rattle		
now	sally	migrundy	had	always	lived	in	her	tiny	cottage	on	the	bank	of	the	tinkling	stream	which	ran	through	the	whispering	forest		
marjorie	said		
dickie	dorn	thought	to	himself	as	he	lay	upon	his	back	under	the	big	oak	tree	and	watched	the	three	crows		
as	he	shuffled	down	the	street	he	clutched	his	coat	tightly	about	his	throat	for	the	air	was	chill	and	he	felt	the	cold		
it	was	a	new	tin	can	house		
she	scolded	as	katrinka	walked	into	the	living	room		
you	may	be	sure	it	was	a	very	happy	place	to	live	and	the	children	made	sally	migrundy	very	happy		
said	the	others		
in	the	morning	mamma	cricket	had	a	hard	time	getting	johnny	cricket	out	of	bed		
never		
illustration	illustration	crow	talk	caw	caw	caw	one	old	crow	cried	as	he	faced	the	other	two	crows		
she	just	hurried	home	and	took	off	all	of	raggedy	ann	's	wet	clothes	and	placed	her	on	a	little	red	chair	in	front	of	the	oven	door	and	then	brought	all	of	the	other	dolls	in	and	read	a	fairy	tale	to	them	while	raggedy	ann	steamed	and	dried		
so	raggedy	ann	sat	quietly	just	as	marcella	told	her	but	she	smiled	at	the	chickens	for	she	had	fallen	time	and	again	and	it	had	never	hurt	her	in	the	least		
dinah	's	big	eyes	rolled	out	in	a	troubled	manner	for	marcella	had	snatched	raggedy	ann	from	dinah	's	hand	as	she	cried	why	dinah		
raggedy	ann	lay	quietly	in	bed	where	thomas	and	annabel	had	tucked	her		
i	should	not	have	offered	the	boys	dear	old	raggedy	ann	to	tie	on	the	tail	of	the	kite		
raggedy	ann	hopped	from	her	bed	and	ran	across	the	floor	trailing	the	bed	clothes	behind	her		
that	night	when	all	the	house	was	asleep	raggedy	ann	raised	up	in	bed	and	said	to	the	dolls	who	were	still	awake	i	am	so	happy	i	do	not	feel	a	bit	sleepy		
she	lifted	the	box	away	and	gave	a	little	squeal	of	surprise	and	happiness		
said	the	old	hens		
go	get	them	fido	and	bring	them	up	so	we	can	see	them		
so	when	raggedy	ann	had	been	returned	to	the	nursery	the	dolls	could	hardly	wait	until	marcella	had	put	on	their	nighties	and	left	them	for	the	night		
i	hope	it	is	n't	a	mouse		
the	dog	catcher	cried	raggedy	ann		
it	needs	more	tail	on	it		
and	of	course	it	happened		
exclaimed	mamma	cat		
cheer	up		
the	kite	released	from	the	weight	of	raggedy	ann	began	darting	and	swooping	to	the	ground		
and	yarn	hair		
what	have	you	there	fido		
cheery		
there	the	dolls	hung	all	day	swinging	and	twisting	about	as	the	breeze	swayed	the	clothesline		
said	the	tin	soldier	who	could	be	very	fierce	at	times	although	he	was	seldom	cross		
suddenly	the	rag	parted	and	raggedy	ann	went	sailing	away	as	the	wind	caught	in	her	skirts		
said	raggedy		
how	lovely		
said	annabel		
and	marcella	looking	up	into	the	tree	above	the	house	to	see	the	robins	discovered	raggedy	ann	peeping	over	the	limb	at	her		
how	do	you	feel		
as	raggedy	ann	hit	the	ground	the	new	puppy	dog	caught	her	dress	and	ran	with	her	across	the	bridge	fido	barking	close	behind	him		
it	was	a	strange	procession		
and	this	is	how	she	did	it		
they	ran	and	they	ran	and	they	ran	and	at	last	they	found	the	kite	upon	the	ground	with	one	of	the	sticks	broken	but	they	could	not	find	raggedy	ann	anywhere		
when	daddy	fished	raggedy	ann	from	the	water	marcella	hugged	her	so	tightly	to	her	breast	the	water	ran	from	raggedy	ann	and	dripped	all	over	marcella	's	apron		
the	dolls	drew	to	one	side	where	raggedy	ann	and	uncle	clem	whispered	together		
here	is	raggedy	ann	she	shouted		
after	a	lovely	tea	party	with	ginger	cookies	and	milk	of	course	the	dolls	were	very	sleepy	at	least	marcella	thought	so	so	she	took	all	except	raggedy	ann	into	the	house	and	put	them	to	bed	for	the	afternoon	nap		
marcella	did	not	like	to	leave	raggedy	ann	with	the	boys	so	she	sat	down	upon	the	ground	to	wait	until	they	pulled	down	the	kite		
illustration	just	as	raggedy	ann	started	to	pick	up	one	of	the	kittens	there	was	a	lot	of	howling	and	yelping	and	fido	came	bounding	through	the	hole	with	mamma	cat	behind	him		
secret	nothing	replied	fido	it	's	kittens		
raggedy	ann	smiled	happily	to	herself	for	boots	had	curled	up	on	top	of	raggedy	ann	and	was	purring	herself	to	sleep		
the	catch	was	too	high	for	raggedy	ann	to	reach	but	peterkins	held	raggedy	ann	in	his	mouth	and	stood	up	on	his	hind	legs	so	that	she	could	raise	the	catch		
come	see		
and	our	lesson	was	that	we	must	never	take	without	asking	what	we	could	always	have	for	the	asking		
cried	all	the	dolls	as	they	pressed	closer	to	raggedy		
they	ran	over	to	where	boots	sat	growling	with	the	tiny	mouse	in	her	mouth		
said	the	new	puppy	dog	as	he	bounced	up	to	raggedy	ann		
the	chances	are	that	she	likes	that	old	rag	doll	better	than	any	of	the	others		
if	your	folks	hear	of	it	they	will	take	the	eggs		
tell	us	what	you	have	been	thinking	dear	raggedy	said	the	tin	soldier		
said	raggedy	ann		
why	dinah		
it	was	a	soft	mellow	light	just	the	sort	of	light	you	would	expect	to	accompany	fairy	folk		
she	did	n't	look	like	our	dear	old	raggedy	ann	at	all		
raggedy	ann	took	two	of	the	kittens	and	carried	them	to	the	house	while	mamma	cat	carried	the	other		
this	raggedy	ann	seems	to	be	a	favorite	with	the	mistress	and	with	all	the	dolls		
replied	raggedy	ann	it	made	me	very	happy		
let	her	ride	up	there		
while	the	dolls	were	talking	marcella	ran	downstairs	with	jeanette	and	told	daddy	and	mamma	who	came	upstairs	with	marcella	and	hunted	around	until	they	discovered	the	mouse	's	doorway		
so	raggedy	was	wrapped	in	a	newspaper	that	evening	and	carried	away		
i	know	poor	mistress	is	very	sad	on	account	of	fido	said	the	dutch	doll	because	i	was	in	the	diningroom	at	suppertime	and	i	heard	her	daddy	tell	her	to	eat	her	supper	and	he	would	go	out	and	find	fido	but	i	had	forgotten	all	about	it	until	now		
said	the	indian	doll		
presently	the	fairies	returned	without	the	bundle	and	disappeared	through	the	nursery	window		
as	fido	neared	the	brook	another	puppy	dog	came	running	across	the	footbridge	to	meet	him		
tell	us	how	to	start	about	it		
and	as	she	slept	marcella	dreamed	that	the	fairies	came	and	took	raggedy	ann	with	them	to	fairyland	for	a	visit	and	then	sent	raggedy	ann	home	to	her		
his	little	heart	was	broken	to	think	that	he	had	caused	raggedy	ann	to	be	drowned		
we	will	plug	up	the	hole	with	something	so	he	will	not	come	out	again		
my		
i	think	it	would	be	a	good	plan	for	us	to	show	our	love	for	mistress	and	try	and	find	fido		
asked	uncle	clem	of	the	french	doll		
thomas	said		
it	was	a	great	relief	although	it	felt	queer	at	first	and	my	thoughts	seemed	scattered		
just	let	me	hang	miss	raggedy	on	the	line	in	the	bright	sunshine	for	half	an	hour	said	dinah	and	you	wo	n't	know	her	when	she	comes	off		
i	thought	i	heard	nibbling	last	night	one	of	the	penny	dolls	said		
a	boy	said	to	marcella	for	the	kite	was	directly	over	here	when	the	doll	fell		
so	the	dolls	sat	and	talked	until	daylight	when	the	painters	came	to	work		
one	old	hen	explained		
raggedy	ann	smiled	at	them		
marcella	was	heartbroken		
squeaked	the	little	mouse	this	is	the	first	time	i	have	ever	been	here		
late	that	night	when	boots	was	the	only	one	awake	out	popped	a	tiny	mouse	from	the	hole		
all	the	dolls	could	feel	raggedy	ann	's	beautiful	new	candy	heart	and	they	were	very	happy	for	her
