so	if	you	ask	one	of	this	set	of	men	for	a	definition	of	a	man	or	of	anything	else	they	have	their	answer	quite	pat	as	the	saying	goes	if	you	press	him	further	he	will	lie	low	or	if	by	sheer	practice	in	arguing	he	has	acquired	a	certain	boldness	and	power	of	speech	the	very	tone	of	the	man	will	tell	you	he	possesses	no	real	knowledge	of	the	thing	he	sets	out	to	define		
for	how	often	and	often	longing	to	get	well	and	familiar	with	advice	like	this	have	i	tried	this	remedy	of	flight	and	though	i	have	feigned	various	other	reasons	for	it	yet	the	end	and	aim	of	all	my	peregrinations	and	all	my	retirement	to	the	country	was	this	one	thingto	become	free

it	is	of	the	latter	that	seneca	was	thinking	when	he	wrote	that	maxim		
you	admit	therefore	that	the	argument	is	just	and	the	chain	of	reasoning	valid	when	we	say	that	a	perfect	knowledge	of	one	's	misery	will	beget	a	perfect	desire	to	be	rid	of	it	if	only	the	power	to	be	rid	may	follow	the	desire		
s.		
petrarch	i	am	sorry	if	i	have	in	any	way	expressed	myself	arrogantly	but	if	the	spirit	is	the	true	rule	of	one	's	deeds	and	words	then	my	own	bears	me	witness	that	i	intended	nothing	in	that	sense		
but	i	loathe	and	abominate	profoundly	everything	that	conceals	from	him	the	truth	that	old	age	is	the	port	of	departure	from	this	life	and	blinds	him	to	the	need	of	reflecting	on	death

he	frequently	reasoned	about	it	with	characteristic	selfconsciousness	and	the	reader	will	note	many	allusions	to	the	subject	throughout	the	present	collection		
it	has	been	suggested	that	francesco	invented	the	latter	as	more	rhythmical	or	adopted	it	on	account	of	some	hidden	symbolic	meaning	as	four	centuries	later	young	arouet	mysteriously	chose	to	call	himself	voltaire
