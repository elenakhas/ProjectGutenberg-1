suppose	the	sun	’s	mass	were	a	mixture	of	hydrogen	and	oxygen	and	it	were	burning	at	a	rate	sufficient	to	produce	the	energy	at	the	rate	it	was	giving	it	off		
if	after	being	pulled	apart	the	atoms	are	allowed	to	come	together	again	they	give	off	energy		
scientists	began	to	speculate	that	electricity	like	matter	might	consist	of	tiny	units		
soddy	had	worked	out	the	way	in	which	atomic	weights	altered	every	time	an	alpha	particle	or	a	beta	particle	was	given	off	by	an	atom		
thomson	’s	instrument	was	the	first	one	capable	of	separating	isotopes	and	such	instruments	came	to	be	called	mass	spectrometers		
in	1900	indeed	becquerel	studied	the	beta	particles	and	found	them	to	be	identical	in	mass	and	charge	with	electrons		
there	were	positive	ions	made	up	of	atoms	or	groups	of	atoms	from	which	one	or	more	of	the	electrons	within	the	atoms	had	been	removed		
uranium	was	the	first	element	found	to	be	radioactive		
when	electricity	broke	up	a	molecule	perhaps	a	unit	of	electricity	attached	itself	to	each	atom		
at	least	elements	with	atomic	numbers	of	43	61	72	75	85	87	and	91	were	still	not	known		
this	seemed	to	show	that	the	cathode	rays	possessed	mass	and	were	a	stream	of	atomlike	particles	rather	than	a	beam	of	massless	light		
in	1911	he	noted	that	when	x	rays	passed	through	atoms	some	were	absorbed	and	some	bounced	back		
what	’s	more	alpha	particles	were	being	emitted	at	velocities	of	perhaps	30,000	kilometers	per	second	while	the	lighter	beta	particles	were	being	shot	off	at	velocities	of	up	to	250,000	kilometers	per	second	about	0.8	times	the	velocity	of	light		
if	only	the	innermost	shell	contained	electrons	and	it	were	filled	with	the	2	electrons	that	were	all	it	could	hold	then	that	was	a	stable	arrangement		
it	also	produced	important	changes	in	matter		
but	what	if	an	atom	did	not	have	its	electron	shell	so	neatly	filled		
there	was	such	a	close	connection	in	fact	that	moseley	could	arrange	the	elements	in	order	according	to	the	wavelength	of	the	characteristic	x	rays		
he	suggested	that	the	sun	was	contracting		
working	backward	however	it	seemed	that	25	million	years	ago	the	sun	must	have	been	so	large	as	to	fill	the	earth	’s	orbit		
when	the	x	rays	struck	atoms	of	high	atomic	weight	the	x	rays	that	bounced	back	were	particularly	penetrating		
by	1906	rutherford	had	worked	out	the	nature	of	the	alpha	particles		
if	it	attached	a	negative	unit	of	electricity	to	itself	it	would	be	pulled	in	the	other	direction		
if	all	the	energy	delivered	by	a	gram	of	uranium	in	the	course	of	its	radioactivity	over	many	billions	of	years	was	totalled	it	was	enormously	greater	than	the	energy	produced	by	the	burning	of	a	candle	with	a	mass	equal	to	that	of	uranium		
was	that	fractional	atomic	weight	something	that	was	possessed	by	all	neon	atoms	without	exception	or	was	it	the	average	of	some	lightweight	atoms	and	some	heavyweight	ones		
in	the	first	years	of	the	19th	century	it	was	found	that	a	current	of	electricity	could	cause	different	atoms	or	different	groups	of	atoms	to	move	in	opposite	directions	through	a	liquid	in	which	they	were	dissolved		
one	of	those	involved	in	the	search	was	the	french	physicist	antoine	henri	becquerel	18521908		
illustration	antoine	henri	becquerel	at	once	physicists	became	fascinated	with	x	rays	and	began	searching	for	them	everywhere		
but	what	was	the	mysterious	radiation	emitted	by	uranium	and	thorium		
this	increases	the	chance	that	some	molecules	will	be	broken	up	into	separate	atoms	though	the	actual	process	is	rather	complicated		
until	then	uranium	had	not	been	of	much	interest	to	chemists		
all	the	rest	of	the	atom	was	filled	with	the	very	light	electrons		
the	answer	was	n’t	easy	to	get		
he	used	the	rise	in	temperature	as	a	measure	of	the	energy		
heat	is	a	form	of	energy	since	it	will	expand	steam	that	will	force	wheels	into	motion	that	can	then	do	work		
for	instance	hydrogen	gas	as	it	is	found	on	earth	is	made	up	of	molecules	containing	2	hydrogen	atoms	each	h₂		
there	are	various	forms	of	energy		
electricity	did	more	than	radiate	through	matter	however		
this	work	of	rutherford	and	soddy	began	a	line	of	investigation	that	by	1907	had	shown	that	there	was	a	whole	radioactive	chain	of	elements	each	one	breaking	down	to	the	next	in	line	by	giving	off	either	an	alpha	particle	or	a	beta	particle	until	finally	a	lead	atom	was	formed	that	was	not	radioactive		
the	2	ions	with	opposite	charges	would	cling	together	since	opposite	charges	attract	and	thus	the	molecule	of	sodium	fluoride	naf	would	be	formed		
others	in	addition	to	becquerel	were	soon	investigating	the	new	phenomenon		
that	is	a	moving	hammer	will	drive	a	nail	into	wood	while	the	same	hammer	held	motionlessly	against	the	nailhead	will	not	do	so		
if	the	atomic	weight	of	some	element	happens	to	be	very	close	to	a	whole	number	to	begin	with	it	may	consist	of	a	single	kind	of	atom		
anything	capable	of	performing	work	is	said	to	possess	energy	from	greek	words	meaning	work	within		
the	amount	of	energy	in	burning	wood	could	be	measured	if	it	were	mixed	with	air	and	allowed	to	burn	in	a	closed	container	that	was	immersed	in	a	known	quantity	of	water		
the	energy	in	a	match	flame	is	enough	to	raise	the	temperature	of	the	mixture	and	to	make	the	hydrogen	and	oxygen	molecules	move	about	more	rapidly	and	more	energetically		
it	did	not	seem	impossible	that	such	a	rule	might	exist	since	one	had	been	found	in	connection	with	matter	that	appeared	in	even	greater	variety	than	energy	did		
helmholtz	calculated	that	the	sun	’s	contraction	over	the	6000	years	of	recorded	history	would	have	reduced	its	diameter	only	560	miles	a	change	that	would	not	have	been	noticeable	to	the	unaided	eye		
the	uranium	series	ought	to	end	with	lead	atoms	that	had	an	atomic	weight	of	206		
in	1912	thomson	was	working	on	neon		
then	98.9	of	all	carbon	atoms	atomic	symbol	c	are	¹²c	but	1.1	are	¹³c.		
the	neon	atom	has	10	electrons—2	in	the	innermost	shell	and	8	in	the	next	and	it	does	not	react		
by	1847	he	was	convinced	that	any	form	of	energy	could	be	turned	into	fixed	and	predictable	amounts	of	heat	that	a	certain	amount	of	work	was	equivalent	to	a	certain	amount	of	heat		
in	1916	the	american	chemist	gilbert	newton	lewis	18751946	carried	this	notion	farther		
in	the	combined	presence	of	a	magnet	and	of	an	electric	field	the	neon	ions	move	in	a	curved	path		
it	is	not	surprising	that	the	atomic	weights	of	nitrogen	and	carbon	are	just	about	14	and	12	respectively		
the	energy	released	by	the	uranium	over	a	very	long	time	grew	to	be	enormous		
the	atomic	number	increases	as	one	goes	up	the	line	of	atoms		
illustration	w.		
it	quickly	turned	out	that	the	atomic	number	was	more	fundamental	and	more	characteristic	of	a	particular	element	than	was	the	atomic	weight		
in	1891	though	the	irish	physicist	george	johnstone	stoney	18261911	suggested	that	the	supposed	unit	of	electricity	be	given	a	name	at	least		
by	1885	however	the	english	physicist	william	crookes	18321919	showed	that	cathode	rays	could	be	made	to	turn	a	small	wheel	when	they	struck	that	wheel	on	one	side		
there	were	the	atoms	which	made	up	ordinary	matter	and	the	electrons	which	made	up	electric	current		
it	is	for	that	reason	that	a	great	deal	of	energy	mostly	in	the	form	of	heat	is	given	off	if	a	jet	of	hydrogen	gas	and	a	jet	of	oxygen	gas	are	allowed	to	mix	in	such	a	way	as	to	form	water		
it	starts	at	one	pole	of	a	battery	or	of	some	other	electricity	generating	device	and	ends	at	the	other		
illustration	niels	bohr	illustration	bohr	’s	study	since	dalton	’s	time	it	had	been	assumed	that	all	the	atoms	of	a	particular	element	were	of	equal	atomic	weight	and	that	atoms	of	two	different	elements	were	always	of	different	atomic	weight		
the	third	was	soon	called	gamma	rays	after	the	third	letter		
the	early	investigators	quickly	found	that	the	breakdown	of	uranium238	for	instance	could	not	be	hastened	by	heat	pressure	changes	in	chemical	combination	or	indeed	anything	else	they	could	think	of		
if	something	like	the	thomson	view	were	correct	then	the	number	of	electrons	each	with	one	unit	of	negative	electricity	would	depend	on	the	total	size	of	the	positive	charge	carried	by	the	atom		
the	rate	of	radioactive	changes	however	could	not	apparently	be	altered		
the	uranium	atom	would	give	off	2,000,000	times	as	much	energy	in	breaking	down	as	the	carbon	atom	would	in	combining		
none	could	either	be	destroyed	or	created		
uranium	x₁	had	however	radioactive	properties	different	from	ordinary	thorium		
the	sun	gave	the	appearance	of	being	a	huge	globe	of	fire		
here	then	is	the	meeting	point	of	electrons	and	of	atoms	the	particles	of	electricity	and	of	matter		
by	1945	all	seven	had	been	discovered		
the	molecules	of	hydrogen	and	oxygen	must	be	separated	and	that	takes	a	little	energy		
in	fact	each	different	type	of	atom	seemed	associated	with	reflected	x	rays	of	a	particular	penetrating	power	so	barkla	called	these	characteristic	x	rays		
to	their	surprise	protons	were	knocked	out	of	the	paraffin		
but	by	einstein	’s	equation	all	that	energy	is	equivalent	to	only	a	little	over	a	millionth	of	a	gram		
chadwick	managed	to	work	out	the	mass	of	the	neutron	from	his	experiments	and	by	1934	it	was	quite	clear	that	the	neutron	was	more	massive	than	the	proton		
the	german	physicist	walther	wilhelm	georg	bothe	18911957	and	a	coworker	h.	becker	were	bombarding	the	light	metal	beryllium	with	alpha	particles		
this	hydrogen	nucleus	had	a	single	positive	charge	one	that	was	exactly	equal	in	size	to	the	negative	charge	on	the	electron		
however	aston	and	his	mass	spectrometer	kept	measuring	the	mass	of	different	nuclei	more	and	more	closely	during	the	1920s	and	found	that	they	differed	very	slightly	from	whole	numbers		
there	was	one	way	of	getting	around	this	and	this	was	explained	in	1935	by	the	american	physicist	j.	robert	oppenheimer	19041967	and	by	his	student	melba	phillips		
this	instrument	was	called	a	cyclotron		
on	the	other	hand	suppose	you	have	lithium7	which	was	thought	to	be	made	up	of	7	protons	and	4	electrons		
illustration	c.		
the	protonneutron	theory	was	therefore	accepted	and	remains	accepted	to	this	day		
in	the	end	if	enough	energy	is	gained	the	proton	could	do	more	damage	than	the	alpha	particle	despite	the	former	’s	smaller	mass		
the	fact	that	the	neutron	was	just	about	as	massive	as	the	proton	was	to	be	expected	if	the	neutron	were	a	protonelectron	combination		
the	protonelectron	theory	was	only	a	theory		
the	result	was	to	combine	part	of	the	alpha	particle	with	the	aluminum27	nucleus	to	form	a	new	nucleus	with	an	atomic	number	two	units	higher—15—and	a	mass	number	three	units	higher—30		
suppose	we	consider	the	neutrons	as	protonelectron	combinations		
twelve	separate	protons	would	have	a	total	mass	of	twelve	times	that	or	12.0939		
the	loss	of	mass	in	radioactive	changes	was	found	to	match	the	production	of	energy	in	just	the	way	einstein	predicted		
illustration	j.		
the	manner	of	radioactive	breakdown	fits	the	theory	too		
for	more	complicated	nuclei	additional	neutrons	are	needed		
new	nuclei	were	produced	that	had	more	energy	than	the	starting	nuclei	so	that	energy	was	absorbed	by	the	nuclear	reaction	rather	than	given	off		
all	the	spins	would	cancel	each	other		
this	was	in	accordance	with	observation		
nevertheless	that	enormous	energy	change	in	the	radioactive	breakdown	represented	only	about	onehalf	of	1	of	the	total	energy	to	which	the	mass	of	the	uranium	atom	was	equivalent		
the	smallest	nucleus	found	was	that	produced	by	knocking	the	single	electron	off	a	hydrogen	atom	in	one	way	or	another		
the	droplets	the	bubbles	and	the	light	can	all	be	detected	one	way	or	another	and	the	path	of	the	subatomic	particle	could	be	followed	by	the	trail	of	ions	it	left	behind		
illustration	walther	w.	g.	bothe	to	try	to	determine	something	about	the	properties	of	this	radiation	bothe	and	becker	tried	putting	objects	in	the	way	of	the	radiation		
since	this	mass	is	intermediate	between	that	of	an	electron	and	proton	such	particles	eventually	came	to	be	called	mesons	from	a	greek	word	meaning	intermediate		
indeed	the	surprise	was	that	radioactive	changes	gave	off	as	little	energy	as	they	did		
for	instance	suppose	the	helium	nucleus	is	made	up	of	4	protons	and	2	electrons	as	was	thought	in	the	1920s		
and	until	it	was	found	the	protonelectron	theory	of	nuclear	structure	whatever	its	obvious	deficiencies	with	respect	to	nuclear	spin	remained	the	only	one	to	work	with		
this	was	the	first	time	in	history	that	the	atomic	nucleus	was	altered	by	deliberate	human	act		
subatomic	particles	could	be	detected	in	a	variety	of	ways	but	every	single	way	right	down	to	the	present	time	makes	use	of	their	electric	charge		
in	that	case	the	nuclear	spin	would	be	3	either	in	one	direction	or	the	other		
to	get	hydrogensparkling	out	of	the	bombardment	of	nitrogen	rutherford	felt	he	must	have	knocked	protons	out	of	the	nitrogen	nuclei		
it	is	for	this	reason	that	gravitational	and	electromagnetic	interactions	can	make	themselves	felt	over	millions	of	miles	of	space		
in	1924	the	austrian	physicist	wolfgang	pauli	19001958	worked	out	a	theory	that	treated	protons	and	electrons	as	though	they	were	spinning	on	their	axes		
in	ordinary	bodies	the	attractions	and	repulsions	usually	cancel	each	other	entirely	or	nearly	entirely	leaving	very	little	of	one	or	the	other	to	be	detected	as	surplus		
measured	in	terms	of	this	natural	unit	of	spin	the	proton	and	the	electron	have	spin	½.		
if	it	were	made	up	of	4	protons	it	ought	to	have	an	electric	charge	of	+	4		
illustration	werner	heisenberg	the	protonneutron	theory	of	nuclear	structure	could	account	for	isotopes	perfectly	well	too

yet	a	fixed	number	of	protons	turned	out	to	have	different	masses	if	they	were	first	considered	separately	and	then	as	part	of	a	nucleus		
d.	anderson	in	1947	however	the	english	physicist	cecil	frank	powell	19031969	and	his	coworkers	also	studying	cosmicparticle	bombardment	located	another	intermediatesized	body	which	had	the	right	mass	and	all	the	other	appropriate	properties	to	fit	yukawa	’s	theories

the	nuclei	that	serve	as	their	targets	are	so	unimaginably	small	that	most	of	the	bombarding	particles	are	sure	to	miss

that	nucleus	often	called	a	deuteron	is	made	up	of	1	proton	plus	1	neutron	and	has	a	mass	number	of	2	and	an	atomic	number	of	1		
their	device	called	an	electrostatic	accelerator	produced	protons	that	were	sufficiently	energetic	to	initiate	nuclear	reactions		
was	it	possible	that	an	electron	and	a	proton	forced	into	the	close	confinement	of	the	atomic	nucleus	might	by	the	force	of	mutual	attraction	become	so	intimately	connected	as	to	count	as	a	single	particle

by	the	time	you	have	gigantic	masses	such	as	the	earth	or	the	sun	the	gravitational	interaction	between	them	and	other	bodies	is	also	gigantic		
within	many	nuclei	the	neutrons	are	quite	stable	and	do	not	break	up	as	they	do	in	isolation		
in	that	case	protons	in	virtual	contact	as	within	the	nucleus	would	attract	each	other	but	if	the	distance	between	them	was	increased	sufficiently	to	place	one	outside	the	nucleus	the	nuclear	interaction	would	decrease	in	intensity	to	less	than	the	electromagnetic	repulsion		
neutron	bombardment	as	soon	as	neutrons	were	discovered	it	seemed	to	physicists	that	they	had	another	possible	bombarding	particle	of	extraordinary	properties		
in	1911	the	austrian	physicist	victor	francis	hess	18831964	had	discovered	that	earth	was	bombarded	from	every	side	by	cosmic	rays		
illustration	energy	created	compared	to	matter	or	mass	destroyed	it	is	this	vast	difference	between	the	tiny	quantity	of	mass	and	the	huge	amount	of	energy	to	which	it	is	equivalent	that	obscured	the	relationship	over	the	years		
these	charged	particles	had	to	be	energetic	to	overcome	the	repulsion	of	the	nucleus	and	to	smash	into	it	with	enough	force	to	break	it	up		
for	more	and	more	massive	nuclei	the	positive	charge	grew	higher	and	the	repulsion	stronger	until	for	elements	beyond	potassium	no	collision	could	be	forced	even	with	the	most	energetic	naturally	occurring	alpha	particles		
no	temperatures	available	to	the	physicists	of	the	1920s	could	force	atoms	to	smash	together	hard	enough	to	reach	and	shake	the	nucleus		
it	seemed	reasonable	then	to	suppose	that	a	nucleus	would	contain	about	half	as	many	electrons	in	addition	to	the	protons		
more	and	more	electrons	seemed	to	be	required	finally	when	the	total	number	of	protons	was	84	or	more	no	amount	of	electrons	seemed	sufficient	to	stabilize	the	nucleus		
in	either	case	electrons	are	knocked	off	atoms	that	are	encountered	by	the	speeding	subatomic	particle		
it	was	in	fact	by	such	an	experiment	that	he	first	demonstrated	the	existence	of	such	nuclei

this	came	about	first	in	1934	when	a	french	husbandandwife	team	of	physicists	frédéric	joliotcurie	19001958	and	irène	joliotcurie	18971956	were	bombarding	aluminum27	atomic	number	13	with	alpha	particles		
the	massenergy	equivalence	fully	explained	why	the	atom	should	contain	so	great	a	store	of	energy		
since	it	has	a	unit	positive	charge	it	can	be	accelerated	just	as	an	isolated	proton	can	be		
until	the	discovery	of	the	neutron	only	two	kinds	of	forces	or	interactions	were	known	in	the	universe		
however	among	the	objects	they	placed	in	the	path	of	the	new	radiation	they	included	paraffin	which	is	made	up	of	the	light	atoms	of	carbon	and	hydrogen		
a	neutron	has	a	spin	of	½	while	a	protonelectron	combination	would	have	a	spin	of	either	0	or	1		
the	nuclear	spin	of	the	common	isotope	nitrogen14	was	measured	accurately	over	and	over	again	and	turned	out	to	be	1		
in	a	rough	way	one	could	tell	the	kind	of	nucleus	that	struck	from	the	nature	of	the	sparkling		
protons	in	nuclei	let	us	nevertheless	go	on	to	describe	some	of	the	progress	made	in	the	1920s	in	terms	of	the	protonelectron	theory	that	was	then	accepted

by	1927	aston	had	made	it	clear	that	it	is	the	middle	elements	in	the	neighborhood	of	iron	that	are	most	closely	and	economically	packed		
in	the	absence	of	electrons	what	kept	the	protons	clinging	together
