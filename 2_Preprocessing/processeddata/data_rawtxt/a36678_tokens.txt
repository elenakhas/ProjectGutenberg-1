perhaps	my	experience	does	not	harmonize	with	that	of	other	trappers	but	the	ways	of	foxes	as	well	as	other	animals	are	much	influenced	by	their	surroundings		
i	suppose	any	log	up	from	the	ground	high	enough	would	do	by	using	the	scent	from	the	female	fox		
of	course	if	the	chaff	be	deposited	in	place	early	in	the	season	allowing	time	to	discolor	and	decay	it	may	help	the	case	or	feathers	may	be	thrown	over	the	bed		
look	up	an	old	path	or	wood	road	where	you	see	that	they	have	traveled	and	notice	a	mound	or	rise	of	ground	now	the	foxes	always	stop	to	urinate	on	all	such	places

now	the	question	arises	did	the	other	foxes	let	instinct	guide	them	to	feed	the	unfortunate	fox	in	the	trap		
in	setting	a	twine	snare	i	always	use	a	drop	log	or	stone	and	so	fixed	that	as	soon	as	the	fox	pulls	the	weight	drops	and	he	is	lifted	and	hung	at	once

i	do	not	see	any	bait	pen		
take	a	small	piece	of	meat	and	place	it	on	the	larger	sod	using	great	care	not	to	leave	human	scent	take	a	few	drops	of	this	decoy	and	place	on	the	bait		
as	a	rule	the	most	acceptable	bait	is	lard	scraps	suet	smoked	meat	rinds	etc		
now	raise	up	the	edge	of	the	hay	at	the	ground	and	slip	the	fish	one	will	be	enough	back	under	the	hay	6	or	8	inches	then	set	your	trap	directly	in	front	of	it	covering	with	the	fine	chaff	now	fasten	the	trap	chain	to	the	piece	of	wood	and	slip	the	stick	back	under	the	stack	working	it	around	a	little	so	when	the	fox	gets	fast	he	can	pull	it	out	easily

i	have	seen	some	shameful	work	done	in	this	respect		
now	five	or	six	inches	from	the	top	of	the	slanted	stick	cut	a	notch	in	your	slanted	stick		
two	logs	for	bottom	is	better	than	one	make	triggers	high	enough	to	suit	the	animal	you	wish	to	catch	if	he	hits	the	string	or	wire	he	is	yours		
these	pieces	should	be	nailed	on	the	top	and	bottom	of	the	sides		
be	sure	and	have	your	paddle	muddy	if	setting	along	creeks		
the	indians	trap	is	made	by	cutting	a	sapling	3	or	4	inches	in	diameter	off	the	butt	end	cut	a	piece	2	foot	and	place	on	the	ground	for	a	bed	piece	drive	four	stakes	two	on	either	side	of	bed	piece	leaving	a	space	between	of	12	inches	using	the	balance	of	pole	for	the	drop	to	play	between	the	stakes		
in	some	of	the	states	such	as	minnesota	iowa	the	dakotas	etc	skunk	are	large	and	are	nearly	all	striped	the	samelong	narrow	stripesbut	owing	to	their	size	they	are	worth	about	the	same	as	the	eastern	short	stripe	or	no		
bait	with	frogs	crabs	or	fish	a	piece	of	muskrat	or	duck	for	coon		
the	top	must	be	covered	and	weighted		
chapter	xi		
he	should	also	have	a	line	of	traps	constructed	in	advance	of	the	trapping	season		
several	may	be	captured	in	one	night	in	this	kind	of	a	trap		
the	trapper	should	always	carry	a	gun	pistol	or	good	revolver	with	which	to	help	kill	game	to	supply	bait	for	his	traps		
pins	should	be	driven	in	the	side	logs	over	the	roller	so	that	the	bear	can	not	raise	the	lid		
it	is	a	good	idea	to	try	the	trigger		
aspring	pole		
skunk	and	opossum	large	length	28	inches	and	8	inches	wide		
when	you	find	a	tall	straight	spruce	or	something	that	is	pretty	straight	not	a	balsam	cut	it	about	a	foot	over	your	head	says	a	northwestern	trapper	or	as	high	as	you	can		
the	bait	also	should	be	something	that	will	flatten	easily	and	not	hard	enough	to	tilt	the	stone	up	after	it	has	fallen		
in	the	illustration	it	will	be	noticed	that	the	opening	or	the	side	which	the	animal	enters	for	bait	is	facing	the	creek		
2	set		
another	way	is	to	cover	the	top	with	rotten	limbs	leaves	etc	and	place	the	bait	on	this		
as	soon	as	the	dthree	inch	nail	is	pulled	down	it	will	slip	past	the	nail	at	top	end	when	spring	pole	will	instantly	take	up	the	slack	also	the	fox	to	staple	and	does	its	work		
for	balance	of	pen	a	few	stakes	bark	or	slabs	cut	from	a	tree

go	about	building	it	this	way	first	select	the	spot	where	you	have	reason	to	believe	that	bear	inhabit	now	having	made	your	selection	get	a	level	place	and	on	this	spot	lay	a	course	of	logs	with	the	top	flattened	off	this	may	be	eight	by	three	feet		
next	lay	a	binder	on	top	of	the	pen	and	upon	either	end	of	the	short	course	of	logs	pin	the	binders	at	either	end	so	the	bear	can	not	raise	the	top	off	the	pen		
next	a	stout	little	birch	or	spruce	is	selected	and	a	section	of	three	or	four	cut	off		
this	done	drive	a	staple	in	tree	over	wire	running	from	spike	to	limb	which	will	prevent	the	animal	being	pulled	over	the	limb	and	escaping		
3	is	another	stub	driven	in	ground	for	bait	stick	no		
it	will	be	seen	that	an	animal	pushing	against	the	door	from	the	outside	raises	it	but	once	on	the	inside	the	more	they	push	against	it	the	tighter	it	becomes		
marten	should	be	stretched	and	dried	on	boards	fur	side	in	but	turned	as	soon	as	dried		
see	cuts	for	the	rest		
yet	there	are	many	good	places	to	build	traps	in	your	immediate	locality	no	doubt		
about	the	last	effort	he	makes	to	free	himself	is	to	ascend	a	tree		
i	have	bought	some	for	a	number	of	years	writes	a	collector	and	know	that	some	trappers	are	like	some	farmers	they	want	as	much	money	for	a	bushel	of	dirty	wheat	as	their	neighbor	gets	for	a	bushel	of	clean	wheat		
1	when	it	turns	the	least	blue		
dig	out	under	pan	so	same	can	fall	when	stepped	upon		
when	set	across	the	entrance	of	dens	it	will	catch	an	animal	going	in	without	bait		
slant	the	other	end	so	the	fall	pole	will	fit	good		
generally	speaking	in	canada	and	the	more	northern	states	trappers	can	begin	about	november	1	and	should	cease	march	1	with	the	exception	of	water	animals	bear	and	badger	which	may	be	trapped	a	month	later		
the	illustration	shows	the	trigger	as	it	appears	in	the	runway		
about	three	inches	from	the	top	use	any	small	round	stick	from	1/2	to	1	inch	in	thickness	not	necessary	to	flatten	no		
recently	two	trappers	wrote	of	their	season	's	catch	and	added	that	a	good	proportion	was	caught	in	deadfalls	and	snares		
in	one	end	of	the	trap	wires	or	small	iron	rods	should	be	placed	see	illustration		
if	you	find	the	bait	gone	and	the	trap	still	up	the	chances	are	that	it	was	set	too	hard	and	the	animal	stole	the	bait		
3	about	one	inch	inside	the	lower	pole	the	other	end	underneath	the	upper	pole		
notch	these	down	as	shown	in	cut	33	so	that	the	top	of	the	logs	are	about	three	or	four	inches	higher	than	the	sides		
this	trap	does	not	take	long	to	make	as	no	pen	need	be	built	the	top	stone	is	large	enough	to	strike	the	animal	making	no	difference	in	what	position	it	gets	when	after	the	bait		
lynx	should	be	cased	and	after	drying	properly	are	turned	fur	side	out	same	as	foxes		
in	the	north	many	trappers	have	such	long	lines	that	they	do	not	get	over	them	only	once	a	week		
turn	trigger	across	opening	slanted	slightly	in	then	you	get	them	by	neck	or	shoulders		
the	illustration	shows	a	square	block	with	the	hole	bored	in	the	side		
i	have	often	visited	traps	of	old	trappers	where	from	two	to	five	carcasses	were	hanging	from	a	nearby	sapling		
but	on	land	they	go	and	it	was	by	deadfalls	the	wayback	indians	killed	a	many	that	were	in	their	packs	at	the	end	of	the	hunting	season		
then	the	bait	will	lay	on	the	foundation	of	trap	within	5	or	6	inches	of	front	of	the	trap		
skunk	should	be	cased	fur	side	in	and	stretched	on	boards	for	several	days		
no	trapper	should	have	more	traps	or	longer	lines	than	he	can	properly	attend	to		
in	building	foundations	for	traps	the	utmost	caution	should	be	exercised	in	getting	them	good	and	solid		
3	  	no		
beaver	are	split	but	stretched	round	and	should	be	left	in	the	hoop	or	stretcher	for	several	days		
the	top	log	should	be	six	or	eight	feet	long	according	to	size	of	animal	you	aim	to	use	trap	for	and	about	the	same	size	as	the	bottom	log		
3	goes	through	a	gimlet	hole	in	no		
it	should	also	be	fastened	lightly	to	the	stakes	on	either	side	so	it	will	not	spring	out	of	shape		
if	the	pole	for	the	fall	is	larger	than	the	notch	is	deep	the	end	must	be	flattened	so	that	it	will	work	easy	in	the	notch	as	a	piece	of	wood	has	been	nailed	over	the	notch	to	hold	the	fall	pole	in	place		
the	snare	is	now	complete	and	the	hunter	stands	back	and	examines	it	critically		
the	skunk	is	the	first	animal	to	become	prime	then	the	coon	marten	fisher	mink	and	fox	but	the	latter	does	not	become	strictly	prime	until	after	a	few	days	of	snow	says	an	old	maine	trapper		
then	cut	two	sticks	two	inches	through	and	fifteen	inches	long	cut	a	notch	in	each	three	inches	from	the	top	and	have	the	notch	in	one	slant	downwards	b	the	other	upwards	a		
the	old	saying	that	fur	is	good	any	month	that	has	an	r	in	does	not	hold	good	except	in	the	north		
chapter	xx		
in	stretching	says	a	north	dakota	trapper	we	use	a	one	board	stretcher	as	follows	put	on	the	fur	after	you	have	fleshed	it	the	four	feet	on	one	side	and	the	tail	on	the	other		
now	use	a	nail	every	inch	and	pull	the	hide	up	between	the	forward	legs	and	nose	until	it	comes	straight	across
