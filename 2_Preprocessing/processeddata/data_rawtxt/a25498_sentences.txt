How he supplicates and whines,                  When he knows his fame is out,                  And sees springing into lines                  All the fables, shout on shout.		
Now the storm is over,                        And the greener plain                        Seems to glow and hover                        Through the thinning rain.		
Avis heard the beaten bell                  Break the quiet space,                  Gathering softly in the room                  Round her face;                  And the sound of wings                  From the deeps of rosy gloom                  Rustled in the place.		
The moon is wrapped in a film,                  She looks wan and chill:                  Gather yourself in your cloak,                  The winter is over the hill.		
From hazy hamlets, one by one,                    Beyond the island bars,                    The casements in the setting sun                    Flash back in violet stars.		
Then shaking out her lawny sails,             Forth on the misty sea she crept;             She left the dawning of the dales,             Yet in his cloak the piper slept.		
Whoo—whoo—                     The frost in the furrow,                     Heat takes long to burrow,                     The fire on the hearth                     Shakes its mirth                     At one of God’s poor,                     Outside the door,                       Whoo—whoo;—yuloô—yuloô.		
The very flowers are musing                  On something they longed to be,                  In a land of peace and promise,                  In a province of the sea.		
When the bloodroot blows in the tangle,                 And the lithe brooks run,                 And the violets gleam and spangle                 The glades in the golden sun,                 The showers are bright as the sunlight,                 April has won.		
I.		
Night in the valley,                    Gloom on the mountain,                    Wind in the wheat,                    Far to the southward                    The flutter of lightning,                    The shudder of thunder;                    But high at the zenith,                    A cluster of stars                    Glimmers and throbs                    In the grasp of the midnight,                    Steady and absolute,                    Ancient and sure.		
Here is pleasure; drink it down.		
The darkness is glooming and brightening,              There is alternate chaos and form,              With the parry and thrust of the lightning              In the turbulent heart of the storm.		
Tendrils of or and azure creep,             And globes of amber light are rolled,             And in the gloaming of the deep             Their eyes are starry pits of gold.		
Sing me a song of the strawberrybent,               Of the blackcap hiding the heap of stones,               Of the milkweed drowsy with sultry scent,               Where the bee drones.		
EQUATION.		
And the fighter to his trull                  Tells his version of the yarn;                  With his bullbrain all afire,                  Charges down the ruddy rag                  Of the world above his ire,                  Tramps the tale in slag and mire.		
Still as a dream till nearly dawn,             The ship was bosomed on the tide;             The streamlet, murmuring on and on,             Bore the sweet water to her side.		
A SONG.		
Whoo—whoo—                     The steam from the thatches,                     The casement tawny in patches;                     Look not yet,                     You might never forget                     The ghost of breath,                     Or the leper Death,                       Whoo—whoo;—yuloô—yuloô.		
Sing me a song of the early spring,              Of the yellow light where the clear air cools,              Of the lithe willows bourgeoning              In the amber pools.		
Sing me a song of the crystal cage,              Where the tender plants in the frames are set,              Where kneels my love Armitage,              Planting the pleasant mignonette.		
Bid him chirp and cry,                       Everything must die,                       She is dead,”                       Now in exequy,                       All is said.		
March wind rough                           Clashed the trees,                           Flung the snow;                           Breaking stones,                           In the cold,                           Germans slow                           Toiled and toiled;                           Arrowy sun                           Glanced and sprang,                           One right blithe                           German sang:                           Songs of home,                           Fatherland:                           Syenite hard,                           Weary lot,                           Callous hand,                           All forgot:                           Hammers pound,                           Ringing round;                           Rise the heaps,                           To his voice,                           Bounds and leaps                           Toise on toise:                           Toil is long,                           But dear God                           Gives us song,                           At the end,                           Gives us rest,                           Toil is best.		
Her soul was chartered for great deeds,                 For gentle war unwonted here:                 Her spirit sought her clearer needs,                 An Empyrean atmosphere.		
Then a storm of burnished doves                  Gleaming from the cote                  Flurried by the almonry                  O’er the moat,—                  Fell and soared and fell                  With the arc and iris eye                  Burning breast and throat.		
He springs upon the trees,                  And he shakes the sleeping nest;                  And every little waterpool                  Has a troubled breast.		
Laughter falling coolly clear,                  Widens air and broaches sun,                  Comes as healing to a fear                  But of self and shadow spun:                  Self, a lanterncandle, throws                  Hugeous spottings on the wall;                  Dance the tragic giant Oes,                  Rayed from pinpoints punctured small,                  In the battered shadowtin                  Fused of deed and circumstance:                  Coward in the gaping ring,                  Bound without and look within,                  Learn where fable flows and whence.		
Heighten mind and heighten life,                  Heighten comment above lure,                  Heighten laughter above strife,                  Bred to scourge the fancy pure.		
The sailors launched a sombre boat,             And bent with music at the oars;             The rhythm throbbing every throat,             And lapsing round the liquid shores,             Was that true tune the piper sent,             Unto the waveworn mariners,             When with the beck and ripple blent             He heard that outland song of theirs.		
The plains are leaping with shadows,              The highlands go out like a blot,              And over the eddying meadows              The rain is hurtled like shot.		
Sing me a song of the fallen mast,                Of the sharp odor the pomace sheds,                Of the purple beets left last                In the garden beds.		
When the sweet airs had fled away,             The piper, with a gentle breath,             Moulded a tranquil melody             Of lonely love and longedfor death.		
And there a ship one evening stood,             Where ship had never stood before;             A pennon bickered red as blood,             An angel glimmered at the prore.		
AUTUMN SONG.		
(One of love without a word,                  Wan to look upon,                  One of fear without a cry,                  Cowering stone,                  And the dower of life,—                  Grief without a single sigh,                  Pain without a moan.)		
Sing me a song of the shallow lakes,              Of the hollow fall of the nimble rill,              Of the trolling rapture the robin wakes              On the windy hill.		
And then at evening came the bark             That stirred his dreaming heart’s desire;             It burned slow lights along the dark             That died in glooms of crimson fire.		
About the coming on of dew,             The sails burned rosy, and the spars             Were gold, and all the tackle grew             Alive with rubyhearted stars.		
IN MAY.		
ADAGIO.		
She sank and sank by yard and mast,             Sank down the shimmering gradual dark;             A little drooping pennon last             Showed like the black fin of a shark.		
Avis!” soft the echo lay                  As the lute.		
When the great day is done,             That seems so long,             So full of fret and fun,             Our little girl is in her cradle laid:             She takes the soft darkpetaled flower of sleep             Between her fragile hands,             Striving to pluck it:             And as the dreamroots slowly part,             She is not in possession of the lands,             Where flowered her tender heart,             Nor in this turmoil dire of cark and strife,             Which we call life,             The which, husbanding all our art,             We will keep veiled until the latest day,             And from her wrapt away:             Then when the drowsy flower             Has parted from the dreamful mead,             And in her palm lies plucked indeed,             When her dear breathing steadies after sighs,             And the soft lids have clouded the blue eyes,             A tiny hand falls on my cheek—             Lightly and so fragrantly             As if a snowflake could a roseleaf be—             And in the dark touches a tear             Which has sprung clear,             From eyes unconscious of their own distress,             At the deep pathos of such tender helplessness.		
Dear God!		
A robin in the morning,                  In the morning early,                  Sang a song of warning,                  There’ll be rain, there’ll be rain.”                  Very, very clearly                  From the orchard                  Came the gentle horning,                  There’ll be rain.”                  But the hasty farmer                  Cut his hay down,                  Did not heed the charmer                  From the orchard,                  And the mower’s clatter                  Ceased at noontide,                  For with drip and spatter                  Down came the rain.		
So the story rolls and grows                  Crescive as a cloudy head,                  Budding silver in the blue,                  From black root of thunder bred,                  With the lightning splitting through.		
It trails into a silver blur,                And hangs about the cherry tops                That sprinkle, with the wind astir,                In little sudden whirls of drops.		
Like the kernels in quern,                        Each in turn,                        Comes to his hour,                        Nor fast nor slow:                        It is well: even so.		
Then she heard within the vast                  Closure of the spell,                  Rolled and moulded into one                  Rounded swell,                  All the sounds that ever were                  Uttered underneath the sun,                  Heard in heaven or hell.		
When the color is free in the grasses,                 And the martins whip the mere,                 And the Marylandyellowthroat passes,                 With his whistle quick and clear,                 The willow is full of catkins;                 May is here.		
It broke in many a crimson sphere             That grew to gold and floated far,             And left the sudden shoreline clear,             With one slowchanging, drifting star.		
Now she dares the comic sprite,                  Laughter only comes to light;                  Ripples outward like a flag                  Over towers inviolate,                  Sparkles April as a brook,                  Breaks where sun and shadow flit;                  Laughter silver and secure,                  From the crystal wells of wit,                  Springing sanely, springing pure.		
With the salt, cool wind in his wing,            And the rush of tears that tingle and start,            With a throb at the throat so he cannot sing,            He nestles him into my lonely heart.		
Every subject stricken blind                  With black fearing of the Dame,                  Strained of nerve and lean of loin,                  Passes on the strangest talk,                  Like a counterfeited coin;                  And the fear of her is wild,                  Works like acid in the blood,                  And the man is worse than child,                  Saved by innocent hardihood.		
Then will come the days of men,                  When the mind will govern power;                  When clear speech will spring again,                  Flower unto a lovelier flower;                  When dear laughter, victor browed,                  From her scorning of your Dame,                  Will play out a lambent flame                  Over life to saneness vowed.		
Here at last is something good,                    Just to warm your flagging blood.		
A storm from the mountain is coming,              With lightning and thunder and rain,              The wind is sweeping and humming              In the butternut trees on the plain.		
The winds that on the uplands softly lie,       Grow keener where the ice is lingering still,       Where the first robin on the sheltered hill       Pipes blithely to the tune, When Spring goes by!”       Hear him again, Spring!		
The birds cry out and are silent,                  They are dreaming once again                  Of the tawnythroated hollow,                  And the fern in the glen.		
When Spring goes by.”                                  MARCH.		
Only when the mind rings true                  To the deepheld undertone                  Heard where Nature moulds her young,                  Will the fancy fail to brew                  Noisome liquor for the tongue.		
’Tis autumn and down in the fields                  The buckwheat is browning still:                  Gather yourself in your cloak,                  The winter is over the hill.		
The rain is awake on the mountain,              ’T is lashing the forest afar              With fall of a shattering fountain              And the tramp and tumult of war,              With the drums of the detoning thunder,              And the clang in the bugles of wind,              With the gonfalons tortured asunder              By the rush of the host from behind.		
Beneath the stars each sent to each             A message tender, till at last             The piper slept upon the beach,             The sailors slumbered round the mast.		
A brook hung sparkling on the hill,             The hill swept far to ring the bay;             The bay was faithful, wild or still,             To the heart of the ocean far away.		
Or she starts a quiet mouse,                  Feeding in the native cheese,                  And a wolf springs from the rind,                  Bloated out to what you please.		
And often in the morning of the heart,            When memories are like crocusbuds in spring,            Thou hast upbuilded in thy crystal soul            Immutable forms of things loved once and lost,            Or loved and never gained.		
But here where human passions pulse in power,           She will transcend our Shakespeare’s art,           From Desdemona to a smothered flower,           Will leap the tragic heart.		
ON THE MOUNTAIN.		
Swarming like ants,                    The Idea for captain,                    No banners, no bugles,                    Only a terrible                    Groundbass of gathering                    Tempest and fury,                    Only a tossing                    Of arms and of garments;                    Sexless and featureless,                    (Only the children                    Different among them,                    Crawling between their feet,                    Borne on their shoulders;)                    Rolling their shaggy heads                    Wild with the unheardof                    Drug of the sunshine;                    Tears that had eaten                    The half of their eyelids                    Dry on their cheeks;                    Blood in their stiffened hair                    Clouted and darkened;                    Down in their cavern hearts                    Hunger the tiger,                    Leaping, exulting;                    Sighs that had choked them                    Burst into triumphing;                    On they come, Victory!		
Beneath the pines he piped and swayed,             Master of passion and of power;             He was his soul and what he played,             Immortal for a happy hour.		
I cherish and cherish my timid guest,            For oh, he has grown so dear to me            That my heart would break if he left his nest,            And dwelt in the strange land down by the sea.

Sing me a song of the thyme and the sage,                Of sweetmarjoram in the garden gray,                Where goes my love Armitage                Pulling the summer savory.		
can she ever forget me                  With a song of mine in her heart?		
A song that will move with a memory                  Of something she loves best;                  A song that will throb at her waking,                  A song that will lull her to rest.		
A deep bell that links the downs                    To the drowsy air;                    Every loop of sound that swoons,                    Finds a circle fair,                    Whereon it doth rest and fade;                    Every stroke that dins is laid                    Like a node,                    Spinning out the quivering, fine,                    Vibrant tendrils of a vine:                    (Bim—bim—bim.)		
From knee to breast the water wore,             It crept and crept; ere they were ware             Gone was the angel at the prore,             They felt the water float their hair.		
Then the prophet robin                  Hidden in the crabtree                  Railed upon the farmer,                  I told you so, I told you so.”                  As the rain grew stronger,                  And his heart grew prouder,                  Notes so full and slow                  Coming blither, louder,                  I told you so, I told you so,”                  I told you so.”                            THE DAME REGNANT.

This pool is quiet as oblivion,     Hidden securely from the flooding sun;     Its crystal placid surface here receives     The wan grey under light of the willow leaves;     And shy things brood about the grass unheard;     Only in sunny distance sings the bird.

F. LANGBRIDGE.		
I have called to see the furniture you have advertised,” he said.		
This is Sunday, you say.		
Superstitious Louis shuddered when he saw this dog.		
Mamma, what are you laughing at?		
She was giving herself to the enemy.		
When the FrancoPrussian war broke out, and for months before, The Turenne was the rendezvous for those of the villagers who had any desire to discuss the situation.		
I cannot leave him.” You must leave him.		
I’ll meet you at that vacant field next the church, at eleven, and the money will be there.” The listener in the next compartment withdrew hastily, and mingled with the crowd at the bar.		
By the next, he saw the head, from which it had rolled, pillowed on his bunk.		
He could no longer cry A Berlin;” the French army was facing Paris, with Berlin at its back.		
A few days after this Pierre returned.		
I’m sorry my call is inopportune, I will come again.” He left his card on the table.		
Perhaps it was the soft tremor that was imparted to his fleshy leg from the gnawing of the wooden one; but Louis never slept more soundly than when this was progressing.		
He sauntered down the street in his shirt sleeves, with his fingers in his vest pockets.		
The calash was farther back in the yard than usual; to drive out he would have to pass Diana’s window.		
Potvin took the weight lightly and threw it over his shoulder.		
Maurice, Maurice, I’m sick of life.		
Pushing open the door, he saw his brother striding up and down the room, with his hands clasped behind him and his head bent, muttering to himself.		
In a moment the bird rushed out and flew madly off.		
He was evidently dressed with great care, in a completely new outfit.		
There, Uncle Garnaud, I know he must mean something by that.		
Everything—everything,” murmured Eloise.		
There was a sudden stir in the room.		
He’s gone,” she said, Jack’s gone.		
Louis, halfafraid of him, gave him a name; he called him Fidele.		
The only thing he discerned distinctly was a white sort of cap.		
At last he said, carelessly, How much?” touching the purses.		
It was only the number of the stove, but it was also the number of his ticket.		
I must protect you.		
Alexis, glancing over his shoulder, gave a hoarse shout, to relieve his excitement; he had seen the head of the chaste Diana.		
Then she went home.		
Charles kept on his wonted way; if they talked in the parlor, they could hear him stirring upstairs; if they strolled in the road, they could see his light in the window.		
Her mother always went away early in the morning and came back before noon, and one day she caught Josephine sewing.		
Fidele lay by his side.		
Yet of that estate this old house, with its surrounding three acres of land, was all that remained; and of the retainers that once held allegiance to this proud name, Louis Bois was the last.		
The tapping woke her; she rose on her elbow; the sound came again; she went to the window and raised a corner of the curtain.		
She expects, some morning, to look across and see the little milliner cast down crumbs for the birds.		
Cuerrier pursed up his lips and whistled the only tune he knew, one from La Fille de Madame Angot.” He was uneasy, too uneasy to follow the intricacies of his tune, and he stopped whistling.		
You are very good, Monsieur.” Not at all; my father picks up these things for the house, when they are really valuable.” These are very valuable.” She still wore an air of shyness, and looked abstractedly from the window into a lilacbush; she seemed nervous and apprehensive.		
Then he shook off the dust of Viger, but not before swearing Louis Bois, who was old enough to be his father, and loved him as such, to stay and watch the forlorn hope of the Rioux Estate until he, the last of the line, should return and redeem his ancient heritage.		
Victor also wonders what he will say.		
Then, taking the empty cage, they went back to the cabin.		
Hans opened it, and said something in German when he saw who it was.		
In truth, if the shopkeeping had been a failure, was it the fault of Josephine or Madame Labrosse?		
It was built of massive timbers.		
I will get it for you.		
And by and by away goes Madame Labrosse, just for a moment,” she says.		
He tossed a sleepless night, and then resolved desperately.		
Pierre was not slow in coming again; but, instead of seeing Eloise, he had a note thrust into his hand by the little servingmaid.		
Their savor only went up and rested in beads on the pane, making a veil behind which they could stiffen and grow cold in protest against an unappreciative public.		
IT was the sunniest corner in Viger where old Garnaud had built his cabin,—his cabin, for it could not be called a house.		
He met Philippe in the hall.		
But the second week in January brought a letter, two days old, from New York.		
The walls of the kitchen story were rough stone, while the upper part had been plastered and overlaid with a buffcolored wash; but time had cracked off the plaster in many places, and showed the solid stones.		
He put on a new peucevelvet coat, which had just come home from the tailor’s, and started for Viger.		
Eloise began to walk up and down the room restlessly.		
A cloud above had taken the starlight, and in the willows a little rain fell with a timorous sound.		
In a moment Josephine is in Victor’s arms, her cheek is against the velvet coat.		
As he took in the money and made change, he uttered the word, Good,” continually, good, good.” There was something exciting in the way he pronounced that word, something that goaded the hearers into extravagance.		
When Pierre next came it was raining quietly through a silver haze; the little maid opened the door; a moment later Eloise came into the room.		
He had drawn a blank.		
The widow watched her go in.		
At last it came to be reality for him, and then he could not sit quietly and watch the lovers; he would let his pipe go out, and stride impatiently up and down the veranda.		
My father wanted me to come out and look at the things you advertised,” he said.		
Alexis looked uneasy.		
In one day thousands of violets had lit their little tips of yellow fire in the tangle of the underwood; in one day the tulips were moulded into fragile cups of flame burning steady in the sunlight; in one day the lilacs had burst their little clovelike blooms, and were crowding in the darkgreen leaves.		
JOSEPHINE,” said Madame Labrosse, quietly, through her tears—Josephine, we must set up a little shop.” Said Josephine, with a movement of despair, Every one sets up a little shop.” True, and what every one does we must do.” But not every one succeeds, and ours would be a very little shop.” There are some other things we could do.” Mamma,” said Josephine, do not dare!		
The days were clear as glass; already the maples were stroked with fire, with the lustre of wine and gold; early risers felt the keener air; the sunsets reddened the mists which lay light as lawn on the low fields.		
The dog’s body broke the old sash and crashed through the glass.		
They parted when they saw him coming, and he stood peering down at the map through his glasses.		
There is a vinous lustre in his eyes.		
Just the money—myself—I—is it not mine?” Some one in the next compartment rose, and put his ear to the partition.		
One night, on the eve of his expectation, Louis fell asleep as he was cooking his supper.		
He was in a perfect fury of rage, and went off to bed cursing like a seapirate.		
It only had one blossom all the time it was alive, and it is dead now and looks like a dry stick.		
No more money was coming in, and Louis had the perpetual sight of the alienated lands before his eyes.		
I know I’ll do something desperate,” she said.		
He had won the seventyfivethousanddollar prize.		
Everything is on three legs.		
68 RUE ALFRED DE MUSSET.		
Suddenly he gives a few sharp cries, as if to try his voice.		
The widow shook her finger at her image in the glass, took on all the colors of the rainbow, and dusted off a guitar of her youth.		
In the autumn he comes sadly up out of the valley, leading his horse, the rein through his arm and his hands in his coatsleeves.
