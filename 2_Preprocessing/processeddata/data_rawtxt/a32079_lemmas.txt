if	this	wind	could	seem	so	sharp	and	brace	,	if	lake	michigan	could	roll	in	such	wave	upon	the	beach	,	what	would	-PRON-	be	to	feel	the	fresh	sea	breeze	,	and	to	hear	the	surf	come	thunder	in	on	the	shore	of	appledore	?		
-PRON-	be	heartily	ashamed	of	be	there	,	eavesdropping	but	—	well	,	one	do	not	get	into	the	war	game	often	.		
that	will	give	-PRON-	a	chance	to	do	a	bit	of	real	sailing	.	"	the	plan	be	readily	agree	to	by	all	concern	,	apparently	with	the	most	heartiness	by	the	josephine	-PRON-	.

the	old	sailor	-PRON-	seem	to	be	full	of	other	thought	,	for	when	-PRON-	speak	again	-PRON-	be	as	much	to	-PRON-	as	to	billy	.		
-PRON-	set	out	together	down	the	lane	,	billy	feel	much	cheer	now	that	-PRON-	have	some	notion	of	what	-PRON-	be	to	do	.		
no	,	"	-PRON-	hear	.		
-PRON-	mind	have	drop	away	entirely	into	the	past	;	-PRON-	talk	of	singapore	now	,	and	of	hot	still	night	on	the	indian	ocean	,	or	of	the	restless	,	choppy	tossing	of	the	china	sea	.		
-PRON-	lay	the	glass	upon	a	ledge	of	rock	,	so	that	-PRON-	should	not	break	-PRON-	as	-PRON-	clamber	down	to	a	low	level	.

do	-PRON-	see	anything	?		
that	’	a	dangerous	kind	of	man	,	billy	wentworth	,	the	most	risky	kind	a	community	can	have	.		
-PRON-	observe	that	the	old	sailor	seem	very	weary	,	that	more	than	once	-PRON-	hand	slip	from	-PRON-	hold	and	have	to	take	a	fresh	grip	.		
-PRON-	forget	captain	saulsby	completely	,	forget	everything	except	that	-PRON-	must	run	to	help	sally	.		
billy	have	a	sudden	feeling	that	-PRON-	would	be	pleasant	to	rejoin	captain	saulsby	and	-PRON-	aunt	as	soon	as	-PRON-	be	possible	.		
all	of	a	sudden	,	as	-PRON-	stand	there	look	,	-PRON-	see	a	fullrigg	ship	dead	ahead	of	-PRON-	,	every	sail	spread	out	to	the	wind	,	-PRON-	bowwave	slant	sharp	out	on	each	side	from	-PRON-	cutwater	,	-PRON-	wake	show	clear	in	a	white	line	of	foam	.		
-PRON-	be	all	dogtired	and	could	have	sleep	where	-PRON-	stand	,	but	the	wind	be	still	up	and	-PRON-	be	not	easy	go	yet	.		
-PRON-	be	right	in	line	to	ram	-PRON-	amidship	;	-PRON-	seem	-PRON-	could	not	miss	-PRON-	except	by	a	miracle	.		
but	on	the	fourth	day	,	a	clear	cloudless	one	,	with	brisk	wind	and	a	sea	so	bright	that	-PRON-	fairly	hurt	-PRON-	eye	to	look	at	-PRON-	,	-PRON-	go	down	to	see	-PRON-	friend	captain	saulsby	and	find	that	-PRON-	,	too	,	be	catch	by	the	fascination	of	this	same	war	game	.		
billy	still	clung	to	-PRON-	and	to	the	boat	while	-PRON-	arm	ache	,	then	prick	and	burn	and	finally	become	numb	.		
wet	footprint	show	on	the	grey	stone	surface	,	as	though	somebody	have	but	now	walk	across	the	weedfringed	rock	,	uncover	by	the	half	tide	,	and	have	then	cross	the	dry	space	above	.		
the	sail	be	hoist	,	the	rudder	adjust	and	the	little	boat	breathlessly	lower	off	the	edge	of	a	rock	.		
the	old	captain	have	revive	enough	to	insist	that	-PRON-	should	be	carry	nowhere	else	,	and	have	have	the	force	to	get	-PRON-	own	way	.		
captain	saulsby	seem	to	know	just	the	moment	when	-PRON-	be	light	enough	for	observation	,	for	-PRON-	pull	the	glass	from	-PRON-	pocket	,	adjust	-PRON-	,	and	look	long	and	earnestly	out	to	sea	.		
-PRON-	go	up	the	step	in	one	breathless	leap	and	come	inside	the	mill	.		
-PRON-	think	-PRON-	clothe	look	as	though	-PRON-	have	be	do	something	dreadful	to	-PRON-	,	"	-PRON-	say	;	-PRON-	be	afraid	-PRON-	will	never	be	good	for	anything	again	.	"	billy	do	cut	rather	a	sorry	figure	for	-PRON-	have	be	wet	and	dry	and	wet	and	dry	again	,	before	-PRON-	long	nap	on	the	dusty	floor	.		
-PRON-	know	all	of	that	kind	of	vessel	that	sail	in	these	water	and	-PRON-	’	a	new	one	to	-PRON-	.	"	-PRON-	adjust	the	glass	again	and	look	long	at	the	move	speck	and	the	wreath	of	smoke	that	trail	across	the	sea	.		
-PRON-	finally	trace	-PRON-	down	to	the	point	here	,	but	when	-PRON-	look	in	at	the	window	of	the	mill	and	hear	the	old	captain	swearing	and	shouting	and	see	only	-PRON-	two	bend	over	-PRON-	,	-PRON-	do	not	think	-PRON-	friend	could	possibly	be	there	.		
the	boy	be	about	to	hurry	after	-PRON-	,	but	sally	put	-PRON-	hand	upon	-PRON-	arm	.

this	be	still	the	burden	of	-PRON-	thought	when	the	boat	round	the	point	into	rockford	harbour	and	appledore	island	vanish	from	-PRON-	sight	.		
-PRON-	go	back	along	the	point	and	up	the	beach	path	,	think	deeply	.		
-PRON-	would	be	more	interesting	to	relate	-PRON-	tale	to	-PRON-	than	to	aunt	mattie	,	although	-PRON-	be	prove	to	be	rather	a	good	sort	,	too	.		
oh	,	stop	-PRON-	,	"	cry	billy	,	in	frantic	excitement	.		
-PRON-	drift	here	and	drift	there	,	lose	or	spend	-PRON-	money	the	day	after	-PRON-	get	to	port	,	and	have	to	ship	again	in	any	berth	-PRON-	could	.		
certainly	the	little	boat	be	do	-PRON-	good	to	be	worthy	of	-PRON-	sofamous	namesake	.		
would	-PRON-	like	to	look	in	?	"	the	big	timbered	door	be	fasten	only	by	an	iron	latch	,	so	there	be	no	difficulty	about	push	-PRON-	open	and	peep	in	.		
if	-PRON-	have	be	young	-PRON-	would	have	be	different	,	when	lad	be	not	use	to	stand	watch	such	a	thing	may	happen	and	-PRON-	know	-PRON-	will	learn	good	,	but	when	an	old	sailor	do	-PRON-	-PRON-	can	be	sure	of	just	one	thing	:	-PRON-	day	at	sea	be	near	-PRON-	end	.		
a	camping	trip	—	among	those	wonderful	mountain	—	plan	by	-PRON-	—	to	include	just	the	boy	-PRON-	want	.		
there	must	have	be	a	draught	under	the	close	door	at	the	top	,	for	-PRON-	make	-PRON-	candle	wink	and	flicker	,	but	-PRON-	march	on	undismayed	.		
once	more	-PRON-	stand	off	on	the	new	course	,	the	tubby	little	craft	rise	and	dip	bravely	,	billy	cling	to	the	tiller	and	begin	to	feel	suddenly	that	the	boat	be	a	live	thing	under	-PRON-	hand	,	ready	to	do	-PRON-	slight	bidding	.		
if	the	tide	be	half	an	hour	high	-PRON-	would	risk	follow	.		
there	be	a	big	fireplace	of	rough	stone	,	a	bench	near	-PRON-	,	a	table	and	a	broken	chair	or	two	,	with	a	threelegg	stool	in	the	chimney	corner	.		
-PRON-	be	the	week	before	easter	,	the	season	of	that	april	session	of	congress	when	the	warbill	slowly	but	surely	make	-PRON-	way	through	senate	and	house	,	and	the	possibility	of	a	struggle	become	a	final	reality	.		
-PRON-	’	queer	than	the	captain	or	johann	too	,	"	think	billy	,	and	with	some	reason	.		
-PRON-	look	to	-PRON-	like	one	of	those	woman	who	would	try	to	grow	poppy	in	a	pot	,	"	-PRON-	say	to	billy	after	-PRON-	have	go	.

-PRON-	folk	be	like	-PRON-	,	though	-PRON-	would	not	think	-PRON-	;	-PRON-	be	people	with	booklearning	,	doctor	and	lawyer	and	the	like	.		
a	friendly	bluejacket	who	have	also	come	to	ask	after	the	captain	’s	welfare	,	take	billy	under	-PRON-	care	,	and	offer	to	conduct	-PRON-	up	on	deck	.		
if	the	whole	united	states	navy	can	not	catch	a	man	like	that	,	"	-PRON-	say	weakly	to	billy	,	-PRON-	guess	-PRON-	’	ned	saulsby	’s	duty	to	keep	in	the	world	a	little	longer	,	and	try	to	be	a	match	for	the	rascal	.	"	the	doctor	say	that	the	old	sailor	’s	recovery	be	miraculously	quick	;	the	captain	-PRON-	,	that	-PRON-	be	slow	than	a	wet	week	.	"	that	woman	,	"	-PRON-	would	say	,	indicate	the	longsuffer	nurse	,	that	woman	that	’	all	rustle	and	starch	and	have	no	real	heart	,	-PRON-	keep	-PRON-	down	,	when	the	only	thing	-PRON-	need	to	get	well	be	to	walk	out	along	the	garden	path	and	feel	the	good	,	warm	sunshine	on	-PRON-	back	.	"	a	day	come	,	however	,	when	that	woman	’s	"	reign	be	over	and	-PRON-	and	the	old	captain	bade	each	other	goodbye	.		
that	,	-PRON-	think	,	must	be	part	of	what	make	-PRON-	feel	so	queer	.		
perhaps	-PRON-	have	less	imagination	than	other	child	and	so	be	not	apt	to	be	arouse	by	the	thought	of	dangerous	possibility	.		
-PRON-	be	at	first	angry	to	find	-PRON-	have	no	hope	of	reach	the	other	shore	;	then	-PRON-	anger	turn	quickly	to	a	single	thought	—	could	-PRON-	possibly	struggle	back	to	land	again	?		
for	nearly	three	year	the	war	have	wag	in	europe	,	a	war	far	too	big	to	realize	,	far	too	distant	to	be	very	disturbing	to	a	schoolboy	’s	daily	life	.		
as	the	boat	puff	out	of	the	harbour	-PRON-	lean	back	in	the	deck	chair	,	content	at	last	,	since	-PRON-	know	that	now	there	be	no	more	obstacle	between	-PRON-	and	-PRON-	journey	’s	end	.		
-PRON-	become	plain	to	the	boy	,	as	-PRON-	cling	determinedly	,	with	one	arm	around	the	old	man	and	one	fling	over	the	ridge	of	the	keel	,	that	the	boat	be	grow	heavy	and	more	waterlogged	with	every	wave	to	which	-PRON-	rise	,	that	-PRON-	one	support	be	slowly	settle	beneath	-PRON-	.		
in	time	of	war	and	tumults	,	"	-PRON-	be	head	,	and	remind	-PRON-	of	what	for	a	little	time	-PRON-	have	forget	,	that	there	be	a	war	.		
-PRON-	be	the	great	lakes	naval	station	,	where	-PRON-	train	the	sailor	for	the	warship	.		
the	rest	of	the	torpedoboat	flotilla	be	come	in	,	too	,	"	say	the	sailor	at	-PRON-	side	,	chuckle	gleefully	.		
poor	thing	,	-PRON-	hate	to	think	of	-PRON-	off	somewhere	droop	and	wither	for	a	whiff	of	fresh	salt	wind	.	"	captain	saulsby	,	"	say	billy	gravely	,	-PRON-	do	believe	-PRON-	care	a	lot	for	those	flower	of	-PRON-	.		
by	the	time	billy	have	finish	eat	,	-PRON-	be	not	only	in	full	possession	of	-PRON-	story	,	but	have	put	on	-PRON-	coat	,	have	get	ready	a	large	bundle	and	a	basket	and	have	explain	as	much	of	the	situation	to	-PRON-	grandmother	as	spasmodic	shouting	could	accomplish	.		
-PRON-	do	not	think	there	be	much	fun	in	adventure	that	-PRON-	have	all	alone	,	"	be	the	grave	comment	that	-PRON-	make	to	-PRON-	as	-PRON-	stumble	up	the	beach	.		
the	destroyer	creep	onward	,	feel	-PRON-	way	,	alter	-PRON-	course	every	now	and	again	to	avoid	some	manofwar	swinging	at	anchor	ahead	of	-PRON-	.		
-PRON-	certainly	have	have	enough	to	kill	any	three	ordinary	man	of	-PRON-	age	,	"	billy	hear	-PRON-	say	,	but	an	old	sailor	like	that	be	make	of	iron	and	rubber	and	rhinocero	hide	.		
captain	saulsby	’s	rheumatism	seem	completely	forget	as	-PRON-	set	off	along	the	shore	path	to	meet	the	boat	when	-PRON-	come	to	port	,	with	aunt	mattie	walk	beside	-PRON-	.		
-PRON-	hold	a	flag	in	each	hand	and	be	spell	out	some	signalled	message	in	frantic	haste	.		
-PRON-	have	wonder	a	good	deal	if	-PRON-	do	not	have	something	to	do	with	each	other	.	"	there	’	germans	and	germans	,	"	the	old	man	answer	.
