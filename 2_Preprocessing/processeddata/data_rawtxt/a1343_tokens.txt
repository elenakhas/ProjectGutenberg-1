one	can	not	make	his	majesty	wait		
it	appears	to	me	that	i	see	upon	yonder	bastion	several	cavaliers	in	red	uniforms	who	greatly	resemble	your	light	horse	whom	we	thought	to	be	killed		
on	that	day	it	was	remarked	by	his	servantsor	in	other	words	by	all	surrounding	himthat	from	the	time	of	his	rising	until	night	he	took	no	nourishment	and	so	fixed	all	the	application	of	his	soul	on	the	events	which	he	had	to	conduct	that	he	triumphed	over	his	physical	pains	seeming	by	forgetting	to	have	destroyed	them		
the	king	has	overthrown	the	cavalry	but	the	foot	still	resist		
i	thought	at	first	that	both	he	and	that	gentleman	would	recover	but	unhappily	only	one	of	them	returned	to	life	and	that	was	he	whom	i	least	knew		
as	the	two	companies	were	marching	out	he	felt	some	one	touch	his	shoulder	and	turning	round	saw	old	grandchamp	leading	a	very	beautiful	gray	horse		
who	is	it	gains	the	prize	in	the	race		
bravo		
a	spent	ball	easily	extracted	had	been	the	only	cause	of	his	accident		
gentlemen	i	said	to	you	before	angrily	replied	the	young	officer	that	i	was	sure	that	capuchin	joseph	who	meddles	in	everything	was	mistaken	in	telling	us	to	charge	upon	the	part	of	the	cardinal		
he	was	allowed	to	travel	and	all	was	ready		
he	is	a	prudent	man	entirely	devoted	to	monseigneur	the	cardinalduke	and	whose	affairs	have	been	somewhat	embarrassed	by	gambling		
at	every	step	however	that	he	took	toward	the	spot	where	richelieu	awaited	him	the	king	's	countenance	changed	and	visibly	fell	he	lost	all	the	flush	of	combat	the	noble	sweat	of	triumph	dried	upon	his	brow		
bring	paper		
the	principal	artillery	officers	were	present	as	well	as	the	marechal	but	no	one	answered	a	syllable		
the	horse	that	sups	hardly	better	than	usual	while	the	master	pockets	the	gold	and	is	envied	by	his	friends	and	admired	by	all	the	lords	as	if	he	had	run	himself		
away	fool		
you	do	not	know	her		
answered	the	old	soldier		
we	shall	not	have	time	to	continue	with	the	sword		
yes	that	feeling	of	love	for	france	which	made	it	beat	in	your	earliest	youth	must	have	gained	greater	strength		
she	cried	and	astonishment	seemed	wholly	to	paralyze	this	young	and	unhappy	beauty		
the	girl	drew	back	and	placed	a	finger	upon	her	forehead		
but	above	all	send	me	every	day	safe	persons	to	give	me	verbal	accounts		
you	have	delayed	long	i	feared	for	you		
yes	i	will	stab	him	with	a	knife		
but	this	caprice	of	glory	shall	not	derange	my	fixed	designs	this	city	shall	not	fall	yet		
we	approve	your	modesty	as	well	as	your	bravery	and	we	shall	not	forget	this		
said	joseph	stopping		
you	are	very	young	monsieur		
his	free	hand	secretly	pressed	the	gold	cross	that	hung	next	to	his	heart	the	beloved	donor	of	which	he	was	so	soon	to	behold		
cinqmars	himself	tasted	one	of	those	moments	of	calm	and	hope	which	so	refresh	the	soul	as	well	as	the	body		
besides	said	she	suddenly	assuming	a	harsh	and	savage	air	men	are	weak	and	there	are	things	which	women	must	accomplish		
what	a	sublime	bond	between	heaven	and	earth		
what	can	he	want	me	for	my	friend		
had	he	not	seen	this	youth	overthrow	his	soldiers	he	would	not	have	believed	him	capable	of	anything	beyond	singing	a	romance	reclined	upon	a	couch		
my	friend	he	answered	gravely	this	excitement	may	be	injurious	to	you		
look	upon	them	as	a	new	language	which	must	be	learneda	language	hitherto	foreign	to	your	lips	but	which	believe	me	may	be	nobly	spoken	and	which	may	express	high	and	generous	thoughts		
the	horse		
the	thought	is	a	vast	one	and	worthy	of	you		
listen	listen	la	valeur		
let	louis	go	i	will	allow	him	to	strike	a	few	poor	soldiers	with	the	blows	which	he	wishes	but	dares	not	to	inflict	upon	me		
they	shook	hands	again	with	effusion	of	heart	and	then	perceived	that	they	had	arrived	almost	before	the	tent	of	the	king		
i	despise	as	much	as	you	the	ambition	which	will	seem	to	possess	me		
iii		
guide	us	monsieur	volunteer	for	the	spaniards	invite	us	to	this	ball	and	we	must	reply	politely		
we	will	present	him	ourselves		
you	seem	to	be	laughing	at	what	i	say	about	your	horse	monsieur	you	forget	that	in	times	of	war	the	horse	is	the	soul	of	the	cavalier		
said	the	king	drawing	his	sword	let	us	charge	and	force	those	villains	back	again		
that	was	a	woman		
de	thou	sat	by	his	side	holding	his	hand	and	grandchamp	at	his	feet	still	grumbling	at	the	numerous	interruptions	that	had	fatigued	his	wounded	master		
i	am	an	officer	will	you	restore	me	to	liberty	that	i	may	once	more	see	my	country		
the	attack	has	begun	on	all	sides	and	we	are	surrounded	by	friends	and	by	enemies		
said	the	king	in	a	loud	voice		
nothing	was	to	be	heard	but	the	gloomy	and	prolonged	cries	of	its	guards	who	warned	one	another	not	to	sleep		
the	cannon	had	ceased	to	roar	when	the	broken	columns	of	infantry	fell	back	into	perpignan	the	remainder	had	met	the	same	fate	was	already	within	the	walls	and	on	the	plain	no	living	man	was	to	be	seen	save	the	glittering	squadrons	of	the	king	who	followed	him	forming	ranks	as	they	went		
i	would	punish	your	angry	dispute	had	it	not	taught	me	many	secrets	of	infamy	on	your	part		
the	oldest	took	the	smoking	match	of	his	arquebus	and	approaching	it	to	the	edge	of	her	robe	said	in	a	hoarse	voice	come	madcap	tell	me	your	history	or	i	will	fill	you	with	powder	and	blow	you	up	like	a	mine	take	care	for	i	have	already	played	that	trick	to	others	besides	you	in	the	old	wars	of	the	huguenots		
so	many	horrors	pursue	me	since	that	sentence	that	i	believe	all	hell	is	loosed	upon	me		
you	do	n't	know	the	fine	language	of	the	court	let	me	speak	to	her		
the	whole	army	had	its	eyes	upon	him	and	could	see	him	from	every	point		
you	shall	give	me	satisfaction	tomorrow	morning		
what	was	it	to	you	that	they	burned	your	cure	great	simpleton		
behold	they	are	wise	and	just	these	grave	and	salaried	criminals		
there	are	times	when	his	master	who	a	moment	before	would	rather	have	been	far	away	finds	himself	victorious	and	rewarded	for	his	horse	's	valor	while	the	poor	beast	gets	nothing	but	blows		
what	childishness		
you	know	my	opinion	concerning	your	insolent	visit	to	my	mother		
they	fell	upon	the	long	column	of	the	enemy	's	cavalry	like	two	vultures	upon	a	serpent	and	making	a	large	and	bloody	gap	they	passed	beyond	and	rallied	behind	the	spanish	bastion	leaving	the	enemy	's	cavalry	so	astonished	that	they	thought	only	of	reforming	their	own	ranks	and	not	of	pursuing		
and	if	your	mind	is	not	disordered	why	these	naked	feet		
says	one	awaking	this	man	has	not	chosen	to	speak		
continued	the	cardinal	still	holding	her	hand		
the	young	frenchman	looked	at	him	with	the	gentle	expression	of	his	age	and	thinking	of	his	own	family	he	said	monsieur	i	will	present	you	to	the	marquis	de	coislin	who	will	i	doubt	not	grant	your	request	is	your	family	of	castile	or	of	aragon		
let	me	be	conducted	to	the	cardinal		
but	we	should	not	scrutinize	it		
cried	joseph	delighted		
i	must	accomplish	it	or	i	shall	die	first		
haste		
but	filled	with	the	suggestion	of	ambrosio	he	thought	that	he	might	have	stolen	these	objects	of	luxury	in	the	pillage	of	the	apartments	of	a	woman	so	going	abruptly	up	to	him	he	said	hombre		
it	is	richelieu		
fools		
the	cardinal	surprised	and	terrified	recoiled	with	horror		
i	am	glad	to	perceive	this	apprehension	in	you	it	may	be	most	salutary	said	de	thou	as	they	rode	on		
no	thou	knowest	it	is	boundless	power	which	makes	creature	culpable	against	creature		
however	since	you	interest	yourself	in	the	matter	i	give	him	a	pension	of	five	hundred	crowns	on	my	privy	purse		
certainly	no	one	will	dare	to	speak	to	him	no	doubt	he	will	quit	the	court	this	very	day		
but	at	every	movement	the	massive	stairs	crumbled	beneath	his	feet	so	that	he	could	not	ascend		
which	of	them	is	worthy	to	listen	to	an	honest	man		
and	accordingly	i	received	nothing	but	compliments	and	agreeable	things	from	the	whole	family	just	in	the	way	i	like		
on	horseback	with	sword	and	pistol	i	suppose		
i	have	since	learned	from	chavigny	that	for	two	long	months	they	had	been	waiting	that	happy	moment		
he	is	ever	a	good	and	honest	man	in	no	way	mixing	himself	up	with	politics	so	that	some	one	gives	him	a	little	army	to	play	at	chess	with	no	matter	against	whom	he	is	content		
the	blood	mounted	to	the	cardinal	's	face		
and	taking	his	friend	's	arm	the	young	mocker	without	listening	to	another	word	walked	rapidly	down	the	gallery	and	disappeared	in	the	throng		
he	would	very	quietly	have	let	this	cure	be	burned	by	the	other	cures	and	would	have	said	to	me	grandchamp	see	that	my	horses	have	oats	and	let	no	one	steal	them	or	grandchamp	take	care	that	the	rain	does	not	rust	my	sword	or	wet	the	priming	of	my	pistols	for	monsieur	le	marechal	thought	of	everything	and	never	interfered	in	what	did	not	concern	him		
violent	desires	for	slaughter	and	revenge	a	vague	desire	to	strike	took	possession	of	him	despite	himself	this	is	the	first	impression	which	evil	produces	on	the	soul	of	a	young	man		
chapter	viii	the	interview	the	pompous	cortege	of	the	cardinal	halted	at	the	beginning	of	the	camp		
the	court	had	been	thus	paying	its	respects	to	the	king	for	two	hours	before	the	cardinal	appeared	the	whole	court	stood	in	close	ranks	behind	the	prince	and	in	the	long	galleries	which	extended	from	his	tent		
two	pages	of	the	first	families	of	france	stood	at	the	door	where	the	ushers	announced	each	of	the	persons	whom	father	joseph	had	found	in	the	ante	room		
for	twenty	years	i	have	been	in	vain	attempting	it		
all	the	most	important	persons	of	the	town	and	many	strangers	were	under	the	peristyle	and	now	advanced	cinqmars	among	them		
obdurate	wretch	return	to	the	demon	who	sent	thee		
this	was	a	very	long	salon	lighted	by	a	series	of	high	lancet	windows	of	which	the	upper	part	only	retained	the	blue	yellow	and	red	panes	that	shed	a	mysterious	light	through	the	apartment		
only	laubardemont	committed	a	slight	blunder	in	making	the	trial	public		
ah		
the	old	dotard	bassompierre	shall	be	doomed	for	perpetual	imprisonment	and	so	shall	the	assassin	marechal	de	vitry	for	that	was	the	punishment	they	voted	me		
and	what	deep	pain	do	they	daily	cause	our	holy	father	the	pope		
the	continuous	interest	of	this	halftrial	its	preparations	its	interruptions	all	had	held	the	minds	of	the	people	in	such	attention	that	no	private	conversations	had	taken	place		
urbain	grandier	on	the	rack	his	mother	in	tears	his	tutor	armed	bassompierre	loaded	with	chains	passed	before	him	making	signs	of	farewell	at	last	as	he	slept	he	instinctively	put	his	hand	to	his	head	to	stay	the	passing	dream	which	then	seemed	to	unfold	itself	before	his	eyes	like	pictures	in	shifting	sands		
he	called	around	him	and	was	attentive	to	the	greatest	enemies	of	the	cardinal	whom	he	expected	every	moment	and	balancing	himself	with	one	foot	over	the	other	an	hereditary	habit	of	his	family	he	spoke	quickly	but	pausing	from	time	to	time	to	make	a	gracious	inclination	of	the	head	or	a	gesture	of	the	hand	to	those	who	passed	before	him	with	low	reverences		
well	we	can	arrange	it	for	him	that	occupation	will	do	as	well	as	another	just	now		
and	then	suddenly	jeanne	began	to	recite	the	service	for	the	dead	in	a	monotonous	voice	but	with	incredible	rapidity	still	seated	on	the	bed	and	turning	the	beads	of	a	long	rosary		
the	duc	d'angouleme	the	marechals	de	schomberg	and	d'estrees	fabert	and	other	dignitaries	were	on	horseback	beside	the	litter	after	them	among	the	most	prominent	were	the	cardinal	de	la	vallette	and	mazarin	with	chavigny	and	the	marechal	de	vitry	anxious	to	avoid	the	bastille	with	which	it	was	said	he	was	threatened		
the	fire	is	out	now	friend	one	effort	more		
i	still	see	all	those	women		
but	employing	such	infinite	calculation	in	merely	keeping	one	's	balance	what	of	genius	remains	for	high	enterprises		
read	his	histoire	de	fiesque	you	may	see	himself	in	it		
a	madrigal	and	a	momentary	submission	on	my	part	will	make	her	forget	that	i	have	separated	her	from	her	house	of	austria	and	from	the	country	of	her	buckingham		
penetrate	into	that	city	resembling	athens	and	to	find	him	who	reigns	there	follow	that	dark	and	irregular	street	mount	the	steps	of	the	old	archiepiscopal	palace	and	enter	the	first	and	largest	of	its	apartments		
monsieur	le	marquis	your	dreams	on	the	contrary	are	very	pretty	ones		
is	it	to	tear	it	that	you	fight	so	often		
but	with	him	the	throne	seemed	in	the	eyes	of	the	court	his	dying	couch	his	reign	a	continual	last	agony	and	his	minister	a	threatening	successor		
do	you	suppose	monsieur	that	i	should	allow	you	to	go	where	you	please		
but	the	rain	still	fell	in	torrents	and	each	piece	of	wood	had	no	sooner	caught	the	flame	than	it	became	extinguished		
why	are	you	sad	if	you	are	a	queen		
father	joseph	arose	and	leaning	against	the	wall	like	an	egyptian	mummy	allowed	nothing	to	appear	upon	his	face	but	an	expression	of	stolid	contemplation		
to	recall	his	mother		
father	joseph	indeed	spoke	to	him	secretly	but	not	in	the	way	the	cardinal	imagined	for	he	contemplated	being	his	equal	and	was	preparing	other	connections	in	case	of	defection	on	the	part	of	the	prime	minister		
such	were	the	commandments	of	the	god	of	france	less	astonishing	in	themselves	than	the	terrible	naivete	which	made	him	bequeath	them	to	posterity	as	if	posterity	also	must	believe	in	him		
he	talks	of	recalling	the	queenmother	said	the	capuchin	in	a	low	voice	of	recalling	her	from	cologne		
you	are	both	right	gentlemen	but	since	when	have	you	laughed	at	affairs	of	honor		
he	will	ruin	her	if	she	connects	herself	with	him	he	's	a	musketeer	in	canonicals	the	devil	in	a	cassock		
i	have	heard	this	monsieur	but	i	have	an	affair	it	is	lucky	for	you	he	stopped	short	in	the	middle	of	your	career		
it	is	open	disgrace		
these	are	calculations	which	your	enemies	make	as	precisely	as	your	eminence	said	the	priest	who	began	to	be	annoyed	with	this	conversation	and	was	eager	to	talk	of	other	matters		
what	dost	mean	blockhead		
the	laughter	which	the	ferocious	pleasantry	of	the	old	minister	had	excited	had	hardly	subsided	when	the	door	opened	and	a	page	announced	several	couriers	who	had	arrived	simultaneously	from	different	points		
joseph	take	a	pen	and	write	what	i	shall	dictate	for	the	other	confessor	whom	we	will	choose	better		
the	innkeeper	in	amazement	touched	his	forehead	three	times	with	his	finger	looking	at	grandchamp	as	if	to	ask	him	whether	his	master	were	also	mad		
on		
he	went	on	a	long	way		
he	felt	a	thicker	one	thrown	over	his	shoulders	it	was	his	old	valet	who	had	approached	him	and	thus	exhibited	toward	him	a	maternal	solicitude		
the	crowd	heard	these	words	and	rushed	forward		
no	no	no		
while	the	public	attention	was	elsewhere	engaged	he	advanced	and	touched	it	lightly	with	his	bare	hand	which	was	immediately	scorched		
instead	of	his	mother	the	child	upon	turning	round	saw	only	men	's	faces	looking	up	at	him	with	a	mournful	eagerness	and	signing	him	to	go	on		
this	circumstance	warned	the	courtiers	in	the	anteroom	that	a	longer	conversation	than	usual	was	on	foot	and	father	joseph	advancing	to	the	threshold	exchanged	with	the	cardinal	a	glance	which	seemed	to	say	on	the	one	side	remember	the	promise	you	have	just	made	me	on	the	other	set	your	mind	at	rest		
and	taking	his	large	blackplumed	hat	from	the	table	he	followed	the	warlike	abbe	who	went	quickly	before	him	often	running	back	to	hasten	him	on	like	a	child	running	before	his	father	or	a	puppy	that	goes	backward	and	forward	twenty	times	before	it	gets	to	the	end	of	a	street		
the	due	de	weimar	pursues	his	advantage	the	duc	charles	is	defeated		
all	color	all	roundness	of	form	had	disappeared	from	it	a	livid	pallor	covered	a	skin	yellow	and	shining	like	ivory	the	blood	seemed	to	have	left	his	veins	all	the	life	that	remained	within	him	shone	from	his	dark	eyes	which	appeared	to	have	grown	twice	as	large	as	before	as	he	looked	languidly	around	him	his	long	chestnut	hair	hung	loosely	down	his	neck	and	over	a	white	shirt	which	entirely	covered	himor	rather	a	sort	of	robe	with	large	sleeves	and	of	a	yellowish	tint	with	an	odor	of	sulphur	about	it	a	long	thick	cord	encircled	his	neck	and	fell	upon	his	breast		
he	thought	he	was	still	dreaming	but	she	grasped	his	hand	firmly		
let	us	leave	our	young	traveller	sleeping	he	will	soon	pursue	a	long	and	beautiful	route		
monsieur	you	know	well	enough	that	it	does	not	embarrass	my	wrist	as	i	will	prove	to	him	who	chooses	as	to	the	gown	itself	i	should	like	to	throw	it	into	the	gutter		
we	have	already	punished	almost	all	our	dupes	of	versailles	assuredly	they	have	nothing	with	which	to	reproach	me		
they	carry	it	in	their	guilty	breasts	it	stings	their	hearts	like	a	serpent		
what	my	lord	leave	the	place	of	the	favorite	vacant	for	six	whole	days		
you	heard	these	infamous	judges		
an	affair	of	honor	whereas	mazarin	is	quite	a	friend	of	yours		
if	the	king	knew	it		
on		
the	child	having	nothing	to	look	at	after	the	court	had	left	the	hall	had	climbed	to	a	small	window	which	admitted	a	faint	light	and	which	he	imagined	to	contain	a	swallow	's	nest	or	some	other	treasure	for	a	boy	but	after	he	was	well	established	on	the	cornice	his	hands	grasping	the	bars	of	an	old	shrine	of	jerome	he	wished	himself	anywhere	else	and	cried	out	oh	sister	sister	lend	me	your	hand	to	get	down		
he	said	publicly	and	in	the	presence	of	monsieur	i	feel	that	one	of	the	first	duties	of	a	christian	is	to	be	a	good	son	and	i	will	resist	no	longer	the	murmurs	of	my	conscience		
another	great	head	is	laid	low		
said	all	the	women		
as	he	said	this	he	turned	toward	the	wall	and	again	pulled	the	clothes	over	his	head		
good		
at	this	moment	and	as	the	greatest	noblemen	present	were	offering	their	arms	to	aid	him	in	walking	a	man	in	the	robe	of	a	referendary	advanced	toward	him	saluting	him	with	a	complacent	and	confident	smile	which	astonished	all	the	people	there	accustomed	to	the	great	world	seeming	to	say	we	have	secret	affairs	together	you	shall	see	how	agreeable	he	makes	himself	to	me		
henri	d'effiat	pressed	blushing	deeply	the	while	his	friend	's	hand	who	hastened	to	have	his	doors	closed		
already	had	tumultuous	scenes	and	conspicuous	assassinations	proved	the	monarch	's	weakness	the	absence	and	approaching	end	of	the	minister	and	as	a	kind	of	prologue	to	the	bloody	comedy	of	the	fronde	sharpened	the	malice	and	even	fired	the	passions	of	the	parisians		
all	those	who	have	noble	hearts	are	indignant	at	this	yoke	and	at	this	moment	more	than	ever	we	see	misfortunes	threatening	us	in	the	future		
he	traversed	the	seas	to	gather	a	flower	upon	which	i	had	trodden	and	ran	the	risk	of	death	to	kiss	and	bathe	with	his	tears	the	foot	of	this	bed	in	the	presence	of	two	of	my	ladiesinwaiting		
that	is	not	the	question	interrupted	gaston		
child	that	you	are	how	little	do	you	yet	know	of	the	court		
but	said	de	thou	very	gravely	upon	my	honor	i	do	not	know	what	you	mean		
it	is	not	she		
had	they	arrived	in	the	night	they	would	not	have	been	seen	which	spoils	the	effect	somewhat	to	speak	the	truth	for	i	grant	that	daylight	is	detrimental	to	them	and	we	would	only	have	heard	the	voice	of	the	people	vox	populi	vox	dei		
the	louvre	is	attacked	and	all	the	populace	are	arriving	from	the	city	i	have	been	told		
open	it	fearlessly	do	not	tremble	as	i	do		
do	you	know	the	end	of	his	favorites		
because	we	should	be	sure	that	tomorrow	morning	he	would	be	against	us		
yes	par	la	corbleu		
yes	of	course		
it	is	above	all	hatred	of	him	which	is	to	predominate	in	the	cries	for	that	is	the	essential	thing		
yes	i	think	today	is	sainte	barbe		
why	so		
believe	me	i	know	him	and	i	have	dearly	paid	for	the	knowledge	of	that	dark	soul		
he	covered	himself	with	the	diamonds	of	the	english	crown	to	please	me		
but	this	joy	was	far	from	being	complete	for	her	heart	was	still	troubled	by	many	things	and	above	all	by	the	presentiment	of	the	regency		
d'effiat	had	not	ceased	to	observe	marie	de	mantua	whose	expressive	countenance	exhibited	to	him	all	her	ideas	far	more	rapidly	and	more	surely	than	words		
behold	               	and	follow		
the	duchesse	marie	de	mantua	was	seated	on	her	right	hand	upon	a	stool		
look	already	who	they	run		
public	criers	rushed	about	red	and	breathless	throwing	on	the	pavement	and	sticking	up	on	the	parapets	the	posts	the	walls	of	the	houses	and	even	on	the	palace	long	satires	in	short	stanzas	upon	the	personages	of	the	time		
here	you	are	my	pet		
she	cried	weeping	like	a	child	that	a	pistolshot	had	broken	her	shutters	and	her	windowpanes	and	had	wounded	her	she	entreated	the	queen	to	send	her	into	exile	where	she	would	be	more	tranquil	than	in	a	country	where	they	wished	to	assassinate	her	because	she	was	the	friend	of	her	majesty		
the	other	women	had	seen	on	a	window	the	reflection	of	torches	and	imagining	that	the	palace	was	on	fire	threw	jewels	laces	golden	vases	and	even	the	china	into	sheets	which	they	intended	to	lower	into	the	street		
ah	how	handsome	he	is	the	love	with	his	big	collar		
it	was	truly	a	cry	from	the	heartan	explosion	of	love	which	reason	could	not	restrain	and	which	escaped	all	bounds		
she	ordered	her	women	to	open	the	door	and	the	duchesse	de	chevreuse	in	her	night	attire	and	wrapped	in	a	great	cloak	fell	nearly	fainting	at	the	foot	of	her	bed	followed	by	four	of	her	ladiesinwaiting	and	three	of	the	women	of	the	bedchamber		
very	well	monsieur	very	well		
as	a	woman	as	a	wife	i	could	have	wept	over	so	mournful	a	position	but	now	see	as	a	mother	i	do	not	weep		
i	love	him	still	in	the	past	more	than	i	could	love	him	in	the	present		
i	am	sure	that	you	have	been	misled	and	deceived		
the	queen	seemed	more	at	ease	in	her	manner	and	language	and	no	longer	preserving	her	severe	and	ceremonious	immobility	she	signed	to	the	other	persons	present	to	approach	her		
said	he	with	deliberation	if	you	give	orders	my	sister	i	will	be	the	captain	of	your	guards	on	my	honor	for	i	too	am	weary	of	the	vexations	occasioned	me	by	this	knave		
i	was	on	the	contrary	nimble	enough	at	the	time	of	my	journey	to	italy	but	then	fear	gives	legs	as	well	as	wings		
what	madame		
if	your	desires	are	well	regulated	they	will	not	cause	     	you	any	torments	and	if	they	are	not	so	you	will	be	punished	by	     	swoonings	similar	to	those	of	celadon	and	the	shepherdess	galatea	     	whom	the	inconstant	hercules	abandoned	in	the	mountains	of	auvergne	     	and	who	gave	her	name	to	the	tender	country	of	the	gauls	or	you	     	will	be	stoned	by	the	shepherdesses	of	lignon	as	was	the	ferocious	     	amidor		
the	coolness	of	anne	of	austria	and	this	last	severe	observation	however	restored	a	little	calm	to	this	beautiful	personage	who	rose	in	confusion	and	perceiving	the	disordered	state	of	her	toilet	went	to	repair	it	as	she	best	could	in	a	closet	near	by		
it	must	be	said	madameyes	it	is	no	longer	time	to	blind	ourselves	to	the	truth	or	to	conceal	it	the	king	's	illness	is	serious		
it	is	montresor	and	monsieur	's	people	said	fontrailles		
by	the	way	it	was	not	the	fete	of	sainte	barbe	i	saw	this	morning		
what	all		
an	asylum		
it	will	be	himself	interrupted	m.	de	bouillon	for	he	seeks	to	be	named	regent	and	i	know	that	at	this	moment	he	contemplates	taking	your	children	from	you	and	requiring	the	king	to	confide	them	to	his	care		
and	it	is	a	treasure	for	it	is	the	blood	of	a	man	who	lives	no	longer	but	who	lived	for	me		
how		
said	fournier		
may	god	aid	you	then	monseigneur	for	man	may	not	do	it	without	institutions		
their	poverty	weighed	less	heavily	upon	them	while	they	contemplated	the	agitations	of	the	rich		
this	monsieur	replied	fournier	is	very	different	from	the	affair	at	loudun		
i	hope	so	madame	since	you	pray	for	me	continued	marie		
the	severe	and	abrupt	tone	of	m.	de	bouillon	did	not	surprise	anne	of	austria	but	she	had	always	seen	him	more	calm	and	was	therefore	somewhat	alarmed	by	the	disquietude	he	betrayed		
absolutely	all	repeated	montresor		
she	said	this	in	spanish	and	the	mystery	of	this	order	spoken	in	a	tongue	which	the	ladies	did	not	understand	restored	those	in	the	chamber	to	their	senses		
i	admit	continued	fontrailles	that	your	highness	ordered	nothing	but	you	permitted	me	to	tell	you	that	i	foresaw	that	this	night	would	be	a	troubled	one	about	two	o'clock	and	i	hoped	that	your	astonishment	would	not	have	been	too	great		
do	you	hear	him	my	brother	and	do	you	not	appear	astonished		
ah	would	to	god	she	exclaimed	that	my	son	's	mind	was	ripe	for	your	counsels	and	his	arm	strong	enough	to	profit	by	them		
never	had	anne	of	austria	looked	so	beautiful	as	at	this	moment	and	the	enthusiasm	she	manifested	electrified	all	those	present	who	needed	but	a	word	from	her	mouth	to	speak		
must	i	encourage	you	to	speak		
at	every	pistolshot	this	timid	prince	rushed	to	the	windows	without	seeing	anything	but	some	flambeaux	which	were	carried	quickly	along		
they	burned	powder		
the	people	imagining	they	recognized	her	redoubled	their	cries	at	this	moment	and	shouted	louder	than	ever	down	with	the	cardinal		
for	these	are	of	his	accustomed	works		
it	appears	to	me	replied	de	thou	gravely	that	you	drink	it	even	to	the	very	dregs		
as	to	courage	it	is	not	the	first	time	he	has	shown	it		
i	would	not	be	stopped		
how	do	we	stand		
i	am	very	cruel	am	i	not	marie		
a	bronze	lamp	of	a	gothic	shape	struggling	with	the	coming	day	threw	its	red	light	upon	a	mass	of	papers	and	books	which	covered	a	large	table	it	lighted	the	bust	of	l'hopital	that	of	montaigne	the	essayist	the	president	de	thou	and	of	king	louis	xiii		
ah		
cried	the	cloakmen	all	at	once		
long	live	the	king		
i	would	stake	my	head	and	my	share	in	paradise	that	no	one	has	seen	my	features	or	called	my	by	my	name		
we	come	to	ask	an	asylum	for	the	day		
you	have	been	deceived	marie		
what	do	i	hear		
an	hour	later	when	they	came	to	tell	her	that	the	crowd	only	awaited	a	sign	from	her	hand	to	withdraw	she	waved	it	graciously	and	with	an	air	of	satisfaction		
continued	the	queen	in	an	extremely	sweet	voice	and	caressing	her	like	a	child	from	whom	one	would	draw	an	avowal		
it	has	cost	me	all	the	power	of	my	rank	the	pleasures	of	my	age	the	affection	of	my	family	and	even	the	heart	of	my	husband
