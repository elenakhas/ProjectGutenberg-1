this	strange	of	all	italian	ambassador	must	have	reach	prague	when	charles	be	fresh	from	a	perusal	of	petrarch	's	first	summon	to	-PRON-	,	which	be	give	below	.		
-PRON-	seem	to	have	reach	the	very	summit	of	-PRON-	fond	hope	and	to	be	metamorphose	by	-PRON-	joy	.		
the	tendency	toward	paganism	which	the	enthusiastic	and	exclusive	study	of	the	ancient	classic	produce	among	the	italian	humanists	of	the	fifteenth	century	be	so	well	known	that	-PRON-	be	natural	to	ask	what	be	the	attitude	of	the	founder	of	humanism	toward	the	generally	accept	religious	belief	of	-PRON-	day	.

but	allegory	be	the	very	warp	and	woof	of	all	poetry	.		
-PRON-	should	much	prefer	to	see	sign	of	exaggerated	apprehension	on	-PRON-	part	(	omnia	tuta	timen	,	as	virgil	say	)	than	any	suggestion	of	wan	affection	.		
consequently	a	new	division	of	the	correspondence	be	form	,	the	important	epistolÃ¦	de	rebus	senilibus	,	letters	of	old	age	,	which	be	write	during	the	last	twelve	year	of	the	poet	's	life	.		
-PRON-	frequently	reason	about	-PRON-	with	characteristic	selfconsciousness	,	and	the	reader	will	note	many	allusion	to	the	subject	throughout	the	present	collection	.		
-PRON-	have	be	suggest	that	francesco	invent	the	latter	as	more	rhythmical	,	or	adopt	-PRON-	on	account	of	some	hidden	symbolic	meaning	,	as	four	century	later	young	arouet	mysteriously	choose	to	call	-PRON-	voltaire	.

-PRON-	may	also	,	-PRON-	hop	,	wander	among	the	tomb	of	the	saint	,	and	gaze	upon	the	spot	that	have	be	hallowed	by	the	presence	of	the	apostles	.		
-PRON-	be	more	indulgent	to	these	,	and	allow	-PRON-	to	live	,	not	so	much	on	account	of	-PRON-	worthiness	as	of	-PRON-	convenience	,	for	-PRON-	do	not	involve	any	additional	labour	of	-PRON-	own	.		
in	the	one	case	-PRON-	be	god	and	thing	pertain	to	-PRON-	that	be	treat	,	in	the	other	mere	god	and	mortal	man	.		
-PRON-	be	of	-PRON-	alone	,	though	,	that	-PRON-	would	speak	now	.

at	the	rumour	of	a	letter	from	-PRON-	the	whole	populace	gather	.		
not	content	with	lose	the	word	of	the	ancient	,	-PRON-	must	attack	-PRON-	genius	and	-PRON-	ash	.		
between	-PRON-	goading	and	-PRON-	own	madness	-PRON-	shall	doubtless	gratify	-PRON-	wish	.		
take	,	for	example	,	the	opinion	,	which	-PRON-	call	in	st.	augustine	to	defend	,	that	-PRON-	endeavour	,	as	well	as	-PRON-	desire	,	be	often	at	variance	with	one	another	.	-PRON-	should	like	,	however	,	if	-PRON-	will	permit	-PRON-	,	to	express	-PRON-	own	view	upon	this	matter	before	come	to	augustine	's	.		
love	be	everything	,	precedence	next	to	nothing	,	among	friend	.		
in	-PRON-	pergamum	there	live	a	certain	man	,	who	,	while	-PRON-	have	but	a	slight	knowledge	of	literature	,	possess	a	good	mind	,	have	-PRON-	earlier	apply	-PRON-	to	study	.		
and	this	return	be	largely	petrarch	's	work	.		
these	logician	seek	to	cover	-PRON-	teaching	with	the	splendour	of	aristotle	's	name	;	-PRON-	claim	that	aristotle	be	will	not	to	argue	in	the	same	way	.		
the	version	here	give	be	base	upon	that	of	rhoades	.		
689	sqq	.		
at	the	least	,	the	pursuit	of	-PRON-	seem	to	-PRON-	in	no	way	ignoble	;	-PRON-	be	,	as	petrarch	say	,	a	"	splendid	preoccupation	.	"		
how	could	-PRON-	have	do	otherwise	?		
-PRON-	must	have	feel	much	the	same	upon	enter	the	town	as	do	apuleius	when	-PRON-	wander	about	hypata	in	thessaly	.		
if	-PRON-	will	but	consult	-PRON-	memory	,	-PRON-	will	scarcely	find	a	firstrate	commander	,	philosopher	,	or	poet	,	who	do	not	reach	the	top	through	the	aid	of	just	such	stimulus	.		
and	-PRON-	have	a	bow	,	and	have	flow	hair	,	in	order	that	-PRON-	may	smite	-PRON-	and	charm	-PRON-	.
