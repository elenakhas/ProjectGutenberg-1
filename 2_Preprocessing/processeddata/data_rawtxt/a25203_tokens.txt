the	liberals	have	gotten	the	upper	hand		
he	did	n't	laugh	again		
he	gestured	at	the	two	in	the	street		
he	woke	from	a	restless	sleep	and	saw	a	small	thing	skittering	toward	him		
there	had	only	been	time	to	dart	in	snatch	a	bow	and	a	few	arrows	and	an	axe		
he	fought	the	war	of	all	which	was	old	and	primitive	and	lost	in	its	own	dreams	against	the	alien	and	the	desecrator		
rain	forests	of	venus	and	the	coughing	roar	of	a	manylegged	swamp	monster	crashing	through	the	trees	to	the	place	where	he	stood	waiting		
shaking	he	peered	into	the	trap		
kreega	collapsed	on	a	shelf	of	rock		
his	nostrils	dilated	with	excitement	a	high	keen	drunkenness	that	sang	wonderfully	within	him		
the	rockhound	was	like	a	gaunt	wolf	but	hugebreasted	and	feathered	a	tracker	as	good	as	any	terrestrial	bloodhound		
but	the	human	had	to	come	near	first	there	he	came	running	and	bounding	over	the	rocks	rifle	in	hand	and	restless	eyes	shining	with	taut	green	light	closing	in	for	the	death		
and	the	wild	martians	made	fine	sportintelligent	game	that	could	get	away	as	often	as	not	or	even	manage	to	kill	the	hunter		
he	rasped	a	curse	on	the	human	and	resumed	his	patient	work	chipping	a	spearhead	for	what	puny	help	it	could	give	him		
for	a	moment	the	warrior	kreega	was	gone	and	a	lonely	frightened	infant	sobbed	in	the	desert	silence		
when	ares	lifted	its	hard	spires	above	the	hills	of	syrtis	where	then	were	the	ancient	gods	of	mars		
the	man	was	a	tiny	speck	in	the	huge	barren	landscape	a	lonely	insect	crawling	under	the	deepblue	sky		
naturally	one	of	their	first	reforms	was	to	end	martian	slavery		
they	're	just	stupid	laborers	as	dependent	on	our	civilization	as	we	are		
they	were	n't	able	toto	empathize	the	martians	or	whatever	you	call	it		
the	martian	was	nowhere	in	sight	but	a	faint	red	trail	led	into	the	rugged	hill	country		
he	checked	his	other	equipment		
they	wore	only	pouched	belts	and	carried	sheath	knives	even	the	liberals	of	earth	were	n't	ready	to	allow	the	natives	modern	tools	and	weapons		
they	were	getting	close		
he	batted	at	the	creature	with	his	spear	and	dodged	around	a	tree		
but	once	he	had	landed	he	was	safehe	could	always	claim	to	be	peacefully	exploring	hunting	leapers	or	some	such	thing		
with	a	savage	thrill	kreega	saw	the	arrow	go	through	the	hound	saw	the	creature	leap	in	the	air	and	then	roll	over	and	over	howling	and	biting	at	the	thing	in	its	breast		
but	riordan	was	close	enough	to	him	now	so	that	the	hound	could	follow	his	spoor	for	mars	had	no	watercourses	to	break	a	trail		
but	it	is	n't	enough		
somewhere	the	soft	trill	of	a	sandrunner	echoed	between	low	windworn	cliffs	and	the	brush	began	to	speak	whispering	back	and	forth	in	its	ancient	wordless	tongue		
a	real	oldtime	warrior	who	hates	earthmen	's	guts		
for	an	instant	a	gray	form	loomed	over	the	edge	hurled	a	spear	at	him		
a	city	dweller	from	earth	would	give	you	a	better	fight		
they	were	native	beasts	long	ago	domesticated	by	the	martians	and	later	by	man		
the	trail	looked	clear	and	fresh	now		
riordan	roared	and	lashed	out	with	a	fist		
mars	was	dark	at	night	its	moons	of	little	helpphobos	a	hurtling	speck	deimos	merely	a	bright	star		
the	spear	glanced	off	the	tough	fabric	of	his	suit	and	he	scrambled	up	a	narrow	ledge	to	the	top	of	the	precipice		
not	that	that	was	likelyhe'd	have	to	find	shelter	somewhere	too	if	he	did	n't	want	to	freeze		
the	brush	rustled	and	something	wailed	in	darkness	and	the	wind	blew	with	a	wild	mournful	sound	over	faintly	starlit	cliffs	and	it	was	as	if	they	all	somehow	had	voice	as	if	the	whole	world	muttered	and	threatened	him	in	the	night		
no	more		
the	man	had	gotten	explosives	from	his	boat	and	blown	up	the	tower		
the	enormous	oneness	of	life	on	mars	drawn	together	against	the	cruel	environment	stirred	in	his	blood		
his	legs	wrapped	around	the	man	's	waist	and	his	hands	got	to	work	on	the	airhose		
what	a	chase		
now	those	old	women	on	earth	want	to	give	'em	the	vote		
the	round	hookbeaked	heads	with	huge	amber	eyes	and	tufted	feather	ears	showed	the	origin	of	the	name	owlie		
the	brush	rustled	dryly	in	alarm	tiny	hidden	animals	squeaked	their	terror	the	desert	shouted	to	him	of	the	monster	that	strode	toward	his	cave		
all	this	day	they	had	been	dogging	him	he	had	never	been	more	than	half	an	hour	ahead		
it	did	n't	matter	the	owlie	would	n't	escape		
presently	he	looked	up	across	a	red	and	yellow	immensity	to	the	low	sun		
no	rest	no	rest	a	devil	's	hunt	through	a	tormented	wilderness	of	stone	and	sand	and	now	he	could	only	wait	for	the	battle	with	an	iron	burden	of	exhaustion	laid	on	him		
with	a	howl	of	dismay	the	hound	slid	down	the	sloping	wall	of	the	pit	it	had	covered		
they	were	the	conquerors	and	it	never	occurred	to	them	that	an	ancient	peace	and	stillness	could	be	worth	preserving		
but	somehow	the	incident	brought	home	to	him	the	immensity	and	the	age	and	the	loneliness	of	the	desert		
he	had	hoped	the	rockhound	would	go	shooting	past	but	the	animal	braked	itself	barely	in	time		
he	grinned	as	he	made	camp		
kreega	swung	softly	around		
he	wrapped	one	arm	around	a	bush	that	clawed	at	his	helmet	and	pulled	the	hound	back		
through	the	darkness	kreega	heard	the	man	laughing		
primitive	throb	of	drums	in	a	hot	wet	night	chant	of	beaters	dancing	around	a	firescramble	along	the	hellplains	of	mercury	with	a	swollen	sun	licking	against	his	puny	insulating	suitthe	grandeur	and	desolation	of	neptune	's	liquidgas	swamps	and	the	huge	blind	thing	that	screamed	and	blundered	after	him	but	this	was	the	loneliest	and	strangest	and	perhaps	most	dangerous	hunt	of	all	and	on	that	account	the	best		
he	itched	intolerably	and	his	lungs	were	raw	from	gasping	at	his	dole	of	air		
the	hawk	swooped	again	and	he	lay	unmoving	rigid	as	if	dead	until	it	cried	in	shrill	triumph	and	settled	on	his	shoulder	to	pluck	out	his	eyes		
that	was	time	enough	when	the	martian	was	boxed	in	so	small	an	area		
leaping	twisting	bounding	from	crag	to	crag	sliding	down	shaly	ravines	and	slipping	through	clumps	of	trees	kreega	fled		
you	're	not	falling	into	this	owlieloving	that	's	corrupted	all	earth		
so	it	did	n't	matter		
he	had	an	airsuit	designed	for	martian	conditions	with	a	small	pump	operated	by	a	powerbeam	from	the	boat	to	compress	the	atmosphere	sufficiently	for	him	to	breathe	it		
he	had	lost	axe	and	bow		
but	times	are	changing		
riordan	was	tired	with	the	long	chase	and	the	niggling	insufficiency	of	his	oxygen	supply		
he	wanted	to	get	the	hunt	over	with		
the	martian	burst	onto	the	edge	of	the	cliff		
the	man	got	to	one	knee	sighting	carefully	on	the	gray	form	that	streaked	up	the	nearest	slope		
dimly	he	wondered	if	man	would	ever	subdue	mars	if	the	human	race	had	not	finally	run	across	something	bigger	than	itself		
lonely	or	not	the	man	had	a	gun	that	could	spang	death	clear	to	the	horizon	and	he	had	his	beasts	and	there	would	be	a	radio	in	the	rocketboat	for	calling	his	fellows		
somewhat	later	he	heard	a	dull	boom	echoing	between	the	hills		
kreega	went	down	the	cliff	face	clawing	into	every	tiny	crevice	shuddering	as	the	ageworn	rock	crumbled	under	his	fingers		
come	on		
asked	wisby		
he	spread	a	map	on	the	desk		
no	danger	that	the	owlie	would	break	in	if	he	should	double	back	it	would	take	tordenite	to	crack	that	hull		
the	chests	were	broad	and	deep	but	the	waists	were	ridiculously	narrow		
we	may	have	to	bombard		
to	loose	the	thousand	earthly	races	and	creeds	and	nationalisms	on	each	otherand	on	the	galaxyto	wallow	in	barbarism	and	slaughter	and	misery	as	before	we	came		
why	i	looked	up	at	her	astonished	even	the	psychologists	they	're	limited	con		
we	settled	it	behind	a	shed	with	the	workmen	looking	on	and	i	beat	him	unconscious	as	fast	as	possible		
the	base	here	has	chaplains		
but	from	their	point	of	view	they	're	slowly	civilizing	a	race	of	atomicpowered	savages	and	taking	no	more	than	their	just	reward	for	it		
its	people	could	live	here	almost	indefinitely	working	and	waiting	for	their	day	of	rising		
we	put	restrictions	on	these	colonials	they	ca	n't	hold	top	jobs	and	so	on		
at	least	there	were	no	halfbreeds	afterward		
like	really	to	help	the	legion	of	freedom	when	they	strike		
he	was	a	nice	kid		
she	did	n't	know	a	great	deal	about	the	rebel	movementno	one	agent	on	earth	didbut	her	knowledge	was	still	considerable		
the	empire	just	does	n't	have	enough	men	for	a	secret	police	even	if	we	wanted	to	indulge	in	that	sort	of	historically	ineffective	control		
maybe	that	's	why	i	'm	afraid		
i	bided	my	time	not	too	obviously	anxious	to	contact	the	legion

but	they	've	kept	on	conquering	here	and	there	to	this	very	day		
the	best	we	could	do	at	this	point	was	to	help	elect	someone	from	a	minority	subgroup	of	the	dominant	white	race		
i	told	them	everything	i	knew

why	y'know	if	t	hadn	been	f	their	laws	i	'd	be	skipper	o	my	own	ship	now		
i	did	my	best	here	too	whipping	my	grim	young	charges	into	a	sapper	group	comparable	to	the	empire	's	for	i	had	to	be	above	all	suspicion	even	of	incompetence		
barbara	was	of	course	venomous	about	it		
so	men	can	talk	between	the	stars	but	are	their	words	the	wiser	for	that		
that	was	a	good	choice	no	spaceship	would	ever	happen	into	this	system	by	accident	or	exploration		
it	's	not	their	fault	if	the	consent	is	forthcoming	oftener	than	you	idealists	think		
riley	gave	me	a	small	card	on	which	was	written	a	name	and	address

moodily	i	began	to	see	that	i	would	be	one	of	the	pricepayers		
but	this	group	constituted	no	real	threat		
they	were	basically	as	decent	and	reasonable	as	any	similar	group	of	valgolians

barbara	shuddered	close	to	me	as	we	came	out	of	the	airlock	and	i	put	an	arm	about	her	waist	knowing	the	sudden	feeling	of	loneliness	which	rose	in	her		
of	course	these	lads	will	be	reconditioned	to	civilization	when	they	finish	their	military	service	and	prepare	for	more	specialized	work

my	work	's	developing	some	complications	i	said	tonelessly		
but	as	the	days	went	on	i	saw	less	and	less	of	it		
for	whatever	i	did	would	make	little	difference	at	this	late	date		
it	would	tend	to	be	passive	whatever	happened		
i	learned	things	which	intelligence	had	spent	the	last	three	years	trying	to	find	out	and	dared	not	attempt	to	transmit	the	information		
the	rebels	were	counting	on	that	fact	to	aid	them	when	they	struck	but	it	would	of	course	work	against	them	if	their	enemy	should	happen	to	hit	first		
but	it	was	more	than	a	change	of	attitude

i	needed	an	excuse	for	not	going	to	the	gun	turret	where	i	was	assigned

the	unit	was	set	for	the	complicated	secret	scrambler	pattern	of	the	legion	one	which	was	changed	periodically	just	in	case
