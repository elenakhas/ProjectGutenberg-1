Then I'll be sober.	Who fears the Parthian or the Scythian horde,        Or the rank growth that German forests yield,      While Caesar lives?	You fly me, Chloe, as o'er trackless hills        A young fawn runs her timorous dam to find,          Whom empty terror thrills            Of woods and whispering wind.	Ask not ('tis forbidden knowledge), what our destined term of years,    Mine and yours; nor scan the tables of your Babylonish seers.	Argos' prophet fell,            He and his house laid low,      And all for gain.	Thine was the sword that Drusus drew,        When on the Breunian hordes he fell,      And storm'd the fierce Genaunian crew        E'en in their Alpine citadel,      And paid them back their debt twice told;        'Twas then the elder Nero came      To conflict, and in ruin roll'd        Stout Raetian kernes of giant frame.	What toils are waiting, man and horse to tire!	BOOK II.	Sun, that unchanged, yet ever new,        Lead'st out the day and bring'st it home,      May nought be present to thy view            More great than Rome!	Now I hold you in my chain,      And clasp you close, all in a nightly dream;          Now, still dreaming, o'er the plain      I chase you; now, ah cruel!	O born in Manlius' year with me,        Whate'er you bring us, plaint or jest,      Or passion and wild revelry,        Or, like a gentle wine-jar, rest;      Howe'er men call your Massic juice,        Its broaching claims a festal day;      Come then; Corvinus bids produce        A mellower wine, and I obey.	Old Tiber, hurl'd in tumult back        From mingling with the Etruscan main,      Has threaten'd Numa's court with wrack                And Vesta's fane.	The dangers of the hour!	O sweetest lyre, to Phoebus dear,        Delight of Jove's high festival,      Blest balm in trouble, hail and hear          Whene'er I call!	XV.	He dwells in Chia's cheek,            And hears her harp-strings move.	E'en now, a helpless wrack,             You drift, despoil'd of oars;      The Afric gale has dealt your mast a wound;        Your sailyards groan, nor can your keel sustain,           Till lash'd with cables round,              A more imperious main.	Shameless I left my father's home;        Shameless I cheat the expectant grave;      O heaven, that naked I might roam             In lions' cave!	Another Salamis in kindlier air          Shall yet arise.	Haste, where gay youth solicits thy regard.	X. EXTREMUM TANAIN.	Now Cytherea leads the dance, the bright moon overhead;        The Graces and the Nymphs, together knit,      With rhythmic feet the meadow beat, while Vulcan, fiery red,        Heats the Cyclopian forge in Aetna's pit.	Blest in the present, look not forth        On ills beyond, but soothe each bitter      With slow, calm smile.	What exiled man          From self can sunder?	Ah!	What cave shall hearken to my melodies,          Tuned to tell of Caesar's praise      And throne him high the heavenly ranks among?	A little dust on Matine shore has spann'd        That soaring spirit; vain it was to pass      The gates of heaven, and send thy soul in quest        O'er air's wide realms; for thou hadst yet to die.	Theirs was a hardy soldier-brood,        Inured all day the land to till      With Sabine spade, then shoulder wood        Hewn at a stern old mother's will,      When sunset lengthen'd from each height        The shadows, and unyoked the steer,      Restoring in its westward flight        The hour to toilworn travail dear.	What dens, what forests these,          Thus in wildering race I see?	Nay,          Nor gold, nor jewel.	For me stern Sparta forges no such spell,      No, nor Larissa's plain of richest mould,          As bright Albunea echoing from her cell.	O, that sweet tormenting play,      That too fair face, that blinds when look'd upon!	This man his planted walks extends        Beyond his peers; an older name      One to the people's choice commends;        One boasts a more unsullied fame;      One plumes him on a larger crowd        Of clients.	XX.	You have hands to square and hew      Vast marble-blocks, hard on your day of doom,          Ever building mansions new,      Nor thinking of the mansion of the tomb.	BOOK I, ODE 7.	EHEU, FUGACES.	The babe unborn:      But, won by Venus' voice and thine,        Relenting Jove Aeneas will'd      With other omens more benign            New walls to build.	Youth removes,        And Beauty too; and hoar Decay      Drives out the wanton tribe of Loves        And Sleep, that came or night or day.	Your grace, sweet Muses, shields me still        On Sabine heights, or lets me range      Where cool Praeneste, Tibur's hill,        Or liquid Baiae proffers change.	Amid her ruin'd halls she stood        Unblench'd, and fearless to the end      Grasp'd the fell snakes, that all her blood        Might with the cold black venom blend,      Death's purpose flushing in her face;        Nor to our ships the glory gave,      That she, no vulgar dame, should grace        A triumph, crownless, and a slave.	Well witting what the torturer's art        Design'd him, with like unconcern      The press of kin he push'd apart        And crowds encumbering his return,      As though, some tedious business o'er        Of clients' court, his journey lay      Towards Venafrum's grassy floor,        Or Sparta-built Tarentum's bay.	What marvel, when at those sweet airs        The hundred-headed beast spell-bound      Each black ear droops, and Furies' hairs        Uncoil their serpents at the sound?	Woe to the eyes you dazzle without cloud        Untried!	That wild Charybdis yours?	My prayers shall reach the avengers of all wrong;        No expiations shall the curse unbind.	In the case of a writer like Horace it is not easy to draw an exact line; but though in the Odes our admiration of much that is graceful and tender and even true may balance our moral repugnance to many parts of the poet's philosophy of life, it does not seem equally desirable to dwell minutely on a class of compositions where the beauties are fewer and the deformities more numerous and more undisguised.	Meantime his lovesick hostess' messenger        Talks of the flames that waste poor Chloe's heart           (Flames lit for you, not her!)	O NATE MECUM.	Not the lopp'd Hydra task'd so sore        Alcides, chafing at the foil:      No pest so fell was born of yore        From Colchian or from Theban soil.	Horace has not seen Pollio's work, but compliments him by saying that he can imagine what its finest passages will be like--"I can fancy how you will glow in your description of the great generals, and of Cato."	O, 'twas a gallant sight to see        The shocks that beat upon the brave      Who chose to perish and be free!	Aye, you heap      On baseness loss.	To take an example mentioned in my notes, it may be better in Book III.	yes, the winds blow free,        When Dirce's swan ascends the skies,      To waft him.	AELI VETUSTO.	lights and wine!	Neptune's feast-day!	The first of March!	XVI.	Money, root of ill,          Doubt it not, still grows apace:      Yet the scant heap has somewhat lacking still.	The case is really one of those noticed in the Preface, where an interpretation which would not commend itself to a commentator may be adopted by a poetical translator simply as a free rendering.	VII.	Your land, your house, your lovely bride        Must lose you; of your cherish'd trees      None to its fleeting master's side        Will cleave, but those sad cypresses.	But should any dream of licence, there's a lesson may be read,      How 'twas wine that drove the Centaurs with the Lapithae to fight.	I have not sought to interpret Horace with the minute accuracy which I should think necessary in writing a commentary; and in general I have been satisfied to consult two of the latest editions, those by Orelli and Ritter.	While I had power to bless you,        Nor any round that neck his arms did fling              More privileged to caress you,      Happier was Horace than the Persian king.	How should a mortal's hopes be long, when short his being's date?	Who curbs a greedy soul may boast        More power than if his broad-based throne      Bridged Libya's sea, and either coast            Were all his own.	He well compares Lucretius, Book I, v. 927--         "Juvatque novas decerpere flores,      Insignemque meo capiti petere inde coronam      Unde prius nulli velarint tempora Musae."	YOU the maidens' dance to lead,      And cast your gloom upon those beaming stars!	In his own hills each labours down the day,        Teaching the vine to clasp the widow'd tree:      Then to his cups again, where, feasting gay,            He hails his god in thee.	Your Muse shall sing in loftier strain        How Caesar climbs the sacred height,      The fierce Sygambrians in his train,            With laurel dight,      Than whom the Fates ne'er gave mankind        A richer treasure or more dear,      Nor shall, though earth again should find            The golden year.	Believe me, from no rascal scum        Your charmer sprang; so true a flame,      Such hate of greed, could never come            From vulgar dame.	Long springs, mild winters glad that spot        By Jove's good grace, and Aulon, dear      To fruitful Bacchus, envies not            Falernian cheer.	XVIII.	Good sons and brave good sires approve:        Strong bullocks, fiery colts, attest      Their fathers' worth, nor weakling dove        Is hatch'd in savage eagle's nest.	It is one of a translator's many refuges, and has been conceded so long that it can hardly he denied him with justice, however it may remind the reader of a bald verbal rendering.	There are objections to both interpretations; a Roman imperator was not called auspex, though he was attended by an auspex, and was said to have the auspicia; auspex is frequently used of one who, as we should say, inaugurates an undertaking, but only if he is a god or a deified mortal.	No heralds shall my deeds proclaim        To Carthage now: lost, lost is all:      A nation's hope, a nation's name,        They died with dying Hasdrubal."	O think of Phaethon half burn'd,        And moderate your passion's greed:      Think how Bellerophon was spurn'd            By his wing'd steed.	The changes which I have made in this impression of my translation are somewhat more numerous than those which I was able to introduce into the last, as might be expected from the longer interval between the times of publication; but the work may still be spoken of as substantially unaltered.	Honour to Proculeius!
