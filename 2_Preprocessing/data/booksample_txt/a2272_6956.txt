"Like smoke in a wind they fled at the last But he in a pass of the hills stood fast, And down at his feet his bow he cast.	All the busy streets are bright.	As Spring can spare the snows   I well could spare it!	Farewell!"	THE POTATO HARVEST.	Fret not that thou must doubt, but rid Thy sky-path of obstructions strewed   By winds of folly.	And now he came upon a slope of sward Against the pool.	While worldlings chase each other madly round   Their giddy track of frivolous gayety, Dreamer, my dream earth's utmost longings bound:   One love alone is mine, my love is Liberty.	A brown sad-colored hillside, where the soil,   Fresh from the frequent harrow, deep and fine,   Lies bare; no break in the remote sky-line, Save where a flock of pigeons streams aloft, Startled from feed in some low-lying croft,   Or far-off spires with yellow of sunset shine;   And here the Sower, unwittingly divine, Exerts the silent forethought of his toil.	And when the beasts could see his form no more, They still could hear him, singing as he sailed, And still they listened, hanging down their heads In long row, where the thin wave washed and fled.	Now at this season the reels are empty and idle; I see them Over the lines of the dikes, over the gossiping grass.	But large increase of knowledge in these days Is come about us, fraught with ill for them Whose creeds are cut too straight to hold new growth, Whose faiths are clamped against access of wisdom; Fraught with some sadness, too, for those just souls Who, clothed in rigid teachings found too scant, Are fain to piece the dear accustomed garb, Till here a liberal, there a literal fragment, Here new, there old, here bright, there dark, disclose Their vestiture a strange discordant motley.	Ah, poor thy gift indeed, unless Thou bring the old child-heartedness,-- And such a gift to bring is given, Alas, to no wind under heaven!	For love of his clear pipe We've flushed the zigzag snipe,-- Have chased in wilful mood The wood-duck's flapping brood,-- Have spied the antlered moose Cropping the young green spruce, And watched him till betrayed By the kingfisher's sharp tirade.	For love that counts the cost I have small need.	ON THE CREEK.	Dear Heart, between us can be no farewell.	We feel our day slip by,   And cling to it in vain.	O'er all the unstable vague expanse   I towered the lord supreme, and smiled; And marked the hard, white sparkles glance,   The dark vault wide and wild.	Under this gloom which yet obscures the land, From ice-blue strait and stern Laurentian range   To where giant peaks our western bounds command, A deep voice stirs, vibrating in men's ears   As if their own hearts throbbed that thunder forth, A sound wherein who hearkens wisely hears   The voice of the desire of this strong North,--         This North whose heart of fire         Yet knows not its desire   Clearly, but dreams, and murmurs in the dream.	What were success   Didst thou not share it?	You will hear the merry town,-- And a weight will press you down.	And thou, dost thou too feel this strange divorce   Of will from power?	And now upon the homeless pack And paling stream arose a noiseless wind Out of the yellow west awhile, and stirred The branches down the valley; then blew off To eastward toward the long gray straits, and died Into the dark, beyond the utmost verge.	Why will ye go so soon, In these soft hours, this sweeter month than June?	Creation, which He covers, Him contains, Even to the least up-groping atom.	Hark now!"	A note of waves and rushing tides, Where past the dikes the red flood glides, To brim the shining channels far Up the green plains of Tantramar.	I let it fall to cover me, or coiled Its soft thick coils about my throat and arms; Its color like nipt beech-leaves, tawny brown, But in the sun a fountain of live gold.	Let me in!	IN THE AFTERNOON.	Faithful was he, aye, I ween,   Pitiful, and kind, and wise; But in mindful moods I've seen   Flame enough in those sunk eyes!	With startled cry the maids Shrank clamoring round their mistress, or made flight To covert in the hazel thickets.	I cowered back in my straitened place   And groped with dim surmise, Not knowing yet.	Hands of chance and change have marred, or moulded, or broken, Busy with spirit or flesh, all I most have adored; Even the bosom of Earth is strewn with heavier shadows,-- Only in these green hills, aslant to the sea, no change!	All the works And words and ways of men and beasts became Evil, and all their thoughts continually Were but of evil.	Tender as sleep, its shadowy palms distil Weird vapors that ensnare our eyes with light.	Sleep, and dream, and be awhile   Happy, Cuthbert, once again!	Not all battle is life, But a little respite and peace May fold us round as a fleece Soft-woven for all men's wear.	It is only a plunge, a quick roll Of our skiff--I will gather and fold You close, for the waters are cold,-- A few sobs, and we rise one soul, Undissevered for ever and ever.	Thick strewn with drift of leaves.	But when the sound of singing died, and when They lifted up their voices in their grief, Lo!	Cease your praying for a minute!	Thy fate thou hast forgot   One moment; the dull pain hath left those eyes     Whose yearning pierces time, and space, and tears.	On the bare hill-summit waves   Still the lonely poplar-tree.	Sage of princes, bane of Ilion's lofty walls!	Gray lay the still sea;   Naked hillside and lea;   And gray with night frost   The wide garden I crossed!	"His breath was a storm and a flame; his feet In the mountains thundered, fierce and fleet, Till men's hearts were as milk, and ceased to beat.	I dread not wrath or wrong,--   Smile, and am free; Strong while the winds are strong,   The rocks, the sea.	Idly took we thought, for still our eyes betray us.	When first did I perceive you, when take heed   Of what is now so deep in heart and brain That tears shall not efface it, nor the greed   Of time or fate destroy, nor scorn, nor pain?	Don't you know   I'm a little nervous, Brother?	But there comes an hour Of fitness perfect and unfettered mood,   When splits her husk the finer sense with power,              And--yon their palm-trees tower!	Farewell!	Afraid, where no fear was.	"He smote with his open hand; and lo!	Warm in that resting-place!	Then to the west appeared a long red trail Over the wave; and Clote Scarp sailed and sang Till the canoe grew little like a bird, And black, and vanished in the shining trail.	--What's that, Brother?	Wind of this summer afternoon, Thou hast recalled my childhood's June; My heart--still is it satisfied By all the golden summer-tide?	Midmost a close green covert of brake   A brown bird listening silently Sat; and I thought--"She grieves for the sake   Of Itylus,--for the stains that lie   In her heritage of sad memory."	Omar's deep doubts still found them nigh and nigher,   And learned them fashioned to the heart's desire.	Here is the lap of life,   Here are the lips of peace.	Subtle though it be,   Yet sweetly sure that word;   E'en such my heart hath heard (Over life's frosty lea) Of Immortality.	TO THE MEMORY OF SIDNEY LANIER.	Many folk are out to-night.	"Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me"--Whitman Not yet, for all their quest of it, have men Cast wholly by the ignoble dread of truth!	Heart of my heart, tho' life   Front us with storm, Love will outlast the strife,   More pure, more warm.	Where the blue lake-water raves,   Still the plover pipe and flee.	For Time Forgets his cunning and assails in vain   Her whose name rings along the poet's rhyme.	No more, then, need we try   The rapture to regain.	Here are tears upon his cheek,   And he sleeps that should be praying;-- Sleeps, and dreams, and murmurs.	"He rose, and took his bow from the wall, And listened; he heard his people's call Pierce up from the villages one and all.	Far up the creek his calls   And lessening laugh retreat; Again the silence falls,   And soft the green hours fleet.	Again that faint wind swept my face--   With hideous menace swept my eyes.	The spell of night and wind,   Baffling desire and dream, dost thou too find?	But, Dear, keep thou in mind   These moments swift and sweet!	He, amazed, Stood with his head thrust forward, while his curls Sun-lit lay glorious on his mighty neck,-- Let fall his bow and clanging spear, and gazed Dilate with ecstasy; nor marked the dogs Hush their deep tongues, draw close, and ring him round, And fix upon him strange, red, hungry eyes, And crouch to spring.	RECKONING.	Ah the old-time stir, how once it stung me with rapture,-- Old-time sweetness, the winds freighted with honey and salt!	L'ENVOI.	I will refrain, and break my dreams, afraid   To stir the yearning I can not fulfil.	Yon sunbeam thick with motes   Athro' the leafage slips, To light the iris wings   Of dragon-flies alit On lily-leaves, and things   Of gauze that float and flit.
