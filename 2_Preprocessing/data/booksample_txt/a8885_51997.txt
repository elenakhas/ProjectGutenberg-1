We might better be idle?	Lay     the finger upon this granite.	All the youth     That come to you, you having the knowledge     Rather than to those uninitiate--     To you, marvelous old queen, give me always     A new marriage--”                         But she laughed loudly--     “A new grip upon those garments that brushed me     In days gone by on beach, lawn, and in forest!	May I be lifted still, up and out of terror,     Up from before the death living around me--     Tom up continually and carried     Whatever way the head of your whim is,     A burr upon those streaming tatters--”     But the night had fallen, she stilled me     And led me away.	Knock the glass out!	--while     his gestures, against the     tiled wall of the dingy bath-room,     swished with ecstasy to     the familiar music of                         his old emotion.	He will have a   heavier rain soon:     pebbles and dirt   and what not.	LIBERTAD!	VI.	IGUALDAD!	Observe     the jasmine lightness     of the moon.	Yes--just!	Silent, her voice entered at my eyes     And my astonished thought followed her easily:     “Well, do their eyes shine, do their clothes fit?	It’s getting dark.	The beauty of     the terrible faces     of our nonentities     stirs me to it:     colored women     day workers--     old and experienced--     returning home at dusk     in cast off clothing     faces like     old Florentine oak.	To you, O mighty, crafty prowler     After the youth of all cities, drunk     With the sight of thy archness!	Let there pass     over the mind     the waters of     four oceans, the airs     of four skies!	First I say this: you have seen     the strange birds, have you not, that sometimes     rest upon our river in winter?	DANSE RUSSE     If I when my wife is sleeping     and the baby and Kathleen     are sleeping     and the sun is a flame-white disc     in silken mists     above shining trees,--     if I in my north room     danse naked, grotesquely     before my mirror     waving my shirt round my head     and singing softly to myself:     “I am lonely, lonely.	Ah!	My two boys?	SUMMER SONG     Wanderer moon     smiling a     faintly ironical smile     at this     brilliant, dew-moistened     summer morning,--     a detached     sleepily indifferent     smile, a     wanderer’s smile,--     if I should     buy a shirt     your color and     put on a necktie     sky blue     where would they carry me?	APPEAL     You who are so mighty,     crimson salamander,     hear me once more.	The flurry     of falling petals is ended.	Come, move!	Must you know everything?	I’m tired.	in a rush, dragging     A blunt boat on the yielding river--     Suddenly I saw her!	My hand for you!	WINTER QUIET     Limb to limb, mouth to mouth     with the bleached grass     silver mist lies upon the back yards     among the outhouses.	Oh then, a wreath!	Hit it there deep under the grass.	On a tissue-thin monotone of blue-grey buds     two blue-grey birds, chasing a third,     at full cry!	Who shall hear of us     in the time to come?	now we are crowned!	What do I care!	Let them cause you to think well then of the storms     that drive many to shelter.	Come down--join me     for I am lonely.	In fact     that’s no place   at all for him--     up there   unceremoniously     dragging our friend out   to his own dignity!	This is fortunate for they would     burn you to an ash otherwise.	Ah!	These things     astonish me beyond words.	The gift of some endures     ten years, the gift of some twenty     and the gift of some for the time a     great house rots and is torn down.	I worn against     the years!”         V.     But it is five o’clock.	She is attiring herself before me--     Taking shape before me for worship,     A red leaf that falls upon a stone!	Observe     how motionless     the eaten moon     lies in the protecting lines.	No!	Give them the slip then;     let them sit in you;     soil their pants;     teach them a dignity     that is dignity, the dignity     of mud!	It is I holds you--     half against the sky     half against a black tree trunk     icily resplendent!	III.	And the next thing I say is this:     I saw an eagle once circling against the clouds     over one of our principal churches--     Easter, it was--a beautiful day!--:     three gulls came from above the river     and crossed slowly seaward!	Go now     I think you are   ready.	look!	Waiting     for the water to freshen--     I glance at the spotless floor--:     a pair of rubber sandals     lie side by side     under the wall-table,     all is in order for the night.	A wind might blow a lotus petal     over the pyramids--but not this wind.	As best as she can     she hides herself     in the full sunlight     her cordy legs writhing     beneath the little flowered dress     that leaves them bare     from mid-thigh to ankle--     Why has she chosen me     for the knife     that darts along her smile?	I come here to mingle faiance dug     from the tomb, turquoise colored     necklaces and belched wind from the     stomach; delicately veined basins     of agate, cracked and discolored and     the stink of stale urine!	That night she came again, hovering     In rags within the filmy ceiling--     “Great Queen, bless me with thy tatters!”     “You are blest, go on!”                               “Hot for savagery,     Sucking the air!	See it splash!	DAWN     Ecstatic bird songs pound     the hollow vastness of the sky     with metallic clinkings--     beating color up into it     at a far edge,--beating it, beating it     with rising, triumphant ardor,--     stirring it into warmth,     quickening in it a spreading change,--     bursting wildly against it as     dividing the horizon, a heavy sun     lifts himself--is lifted--     bit by bit above the edge     of things,--runs free at last     out into the open--!	These are shining topics     my townspeople but--     hardly of great moment.	I went into the city,     Out again, baffled onto the mountain!	This sarcophagus contained the body     of Uresh-Nai, priestess to the goddess Mut,     Mother of All--     Run your finger against this edge!	And she waved me     From the white wet in midst of her playing!	That’s all I care for now.	It is true:     in the light colors     of morning     brown-stone and slate     shine orange and dark blue.	INVITATION     You who had the sense     to choose me such a mother,     you who had the indifference     to create me,     you who went to some pains     to leave hands off me     in the formative stages,--     (I thank you most for that     perhaps)                       but you who     with an iron head, first,     fiercest and with strongest love     brutalized me into strength,     old dew-lap,--     I have reached the stage     where I am teaching myself     to laugh.	They’ll pass through.	Some common memento   is better,     something he prized   and is known by:     his old clothes--   a few books perhaps--     God knows what!	Your moods are slow     the shedding of leaves     and sure     the return in May!	Take off   the silk hat!	The steps to the museum are high.	But you got to try hard--     But--               Well, you know how     the young girls run giggling     on Park Avenue after dark     when they ought to be home in bed?	THE OLD MEN     Old men who have studied     every leg show     in the city     Old men cut from touch     by the perfumed music--     polished or fleeced skulls     that stand before     the whole theater     in silent attitudes     of attention,--     old men who have taken precedence     over young men     and even over dark-faced     husbands whose minds     are a street with arc-lights.	Pulls the whole     counter-pulling mass upward, to the right,     locks even the opaque, not yet defined     ground in a terrific drag that is     loosening the very tap-roots!	Your death?--water     spilled upon the ground--     though water will mount again into rose-leaves--     but you?--would hold life still,     even as a memory, when it is over.	They hold firm     break with a roar     show the white!	It was a fearful thing     to come into a man’s heart     at that time: that stone     over the little blinking stars     they’d set there.	Away now for the cows!	Brother!	Is there no place     where we can be at peace together     and the motion of our drawing apart     be altogether taken up?	--sepals     that guard and contain     the flower!	Love is     a lice comber!
