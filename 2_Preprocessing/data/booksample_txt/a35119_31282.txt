They eagerly turned it over to the Earthmen in exchange for green certificates with pretty pictures engraved thereon.	It is these poppies which have colored the planet red.	_Hairoscope_: A very sensitive instrument for space      navigation.	_Spacemen_: Those who man the space ships.	There was nothing they would not do for a pinch of sugar.	They buy their dresses at a place called Kress-Worth and look like Paris _nouveau riche_.	There was to be service by a private airline.	This proved embarrassing, to say the least, to the procurers.	With no Harvard bigdomes to tell them gold is a thing of the past, the yellow metal circulates there as freely and easily as we once kicked pennies around before they became extinct here.	The space ship went into shuttle service.	Then the money guys came to look over their purchase.	Why a spaceman wants to stand on the outer hull of a      ship halfway to Mars is not clear.	Then they went to the chieftains and sold them a bill of goods (with a generous bribe of sugar) to close the borders.	They were eating it!	VII ONE UNIVERSE CONFIDENTIAL Mars is presently no problem to Earth, and will not be until we have all its gold and the Martians begin asking us for loans.	Then the boys from the more dignified end of the business drop in at the home of the victim and offer to bury him cheap.	However, the Mafia, which is a world-wide blood brotherhood with colonies in every land and clime, has a universal language.	Instead, we should heavily arm our own satellites, which will make us secure from attack by an alien planet or constellation.	And he was right.	A hurried meeting of the Grand Council was called and held in a bungalow on the shores of one of Minneapolis' beautiful lakes.	Baloney.	This is serious."	Martians are strictly vegetarian: they bake, fry and stew these flowers and weeds and eat them raw with a goo made from fungus and called _szchmortz_ which passes for a salad dressing.	"I beg your pardon, sir.	These hairs are obtained from the      Glomph-Frog, found only in the heart of the dense Venusian      swamps.	From this random suggestion, there sprang up a major interplanetary project.	They were too dumb to be thieves.	They smelled worse than Texas yahoos just off a cow farm.	It would be so ultra-ultra that suckers with only a million would be thumbed away and guys with two million would have to come in through the back door.	Knives and brass knucks are understood everywhere.	Furthermore, through propaganda and infiltration, there were Communist cells in every quarter of the planet, and many of the top officials of the four Martian governments were either secretly party members or openly in fronts.	_Asteroids_: Tiny worlds floating around in space, put there      no doubt to annoy unwary space ships.	This cell was so active that Commies had taken over almost half the planet before the arrival of the Mafia, with their domain extending from the _Deucalionis Region_ all the way over to _Phaethontis_ and down to _Titania_.	The hop back, for various reasons, took a little longer.	They are known as the East Side, West Side, North Side and Gas House gangs.	That is how the crime trust found out that there is no sugar on Mars; that this was the first time it had ever been tasted by a Martian; that it acts on them like junk does on an Earthman.	Communists are in favor of anything that causes civil disorder and unrest; gangsters have no conscience and will do business with anyone who pays.	Considerable sums of money were invested in this human cargo, and the boys feared dire consequences from their shylocks, should they return empty-handed.	All the rest has been taken care of."	They've been cutting dope with sugar for years on Earth, so they didn't know how to do it any different on Mars.	Finally, a meeting was held at which one punk asked another, "What the hell kind of town is it with no cops?	Did you ever see an Alaska _klutch_ (pronounced klootch)?	The planet became known as "The Red Red Planet."	The men are put into modernistic diving suits.	Struck with the novelty of the thing, quite a few Martians remember other Martians they are mad at.	Instead of air-conditioning, it had oxygen-conditioning.	What are bims?"	Inasmuch as Martians live underground, burying is done in reverse, by tying a rocket to the tail of the deceased and shooting him out into the stratosphere.	And we defy anyone to call us liars--and prove it!	One reason may have been the condition of the crew.	Thereupon, half the female population ran after the berserk Martian.	The natives were not acquisitive.	Never having had the great advantages of a New Deal, the Martians are still backward and use gold as a means of exchange.	"Maybe you got something there.	The mob plans to retail them for $25 a carat!	_Space Academy_: A college where young men are trained to be      spacemen.	Maybe this is why they stayed close to home.	But the town had no police station.	They had been led to believe by the little guy who escorted them that all Martian dames resembled Marilyn Monroe, only more so, and the men were Adonises (and not Joe).	He escorted them into the cigar, pressed a button here and there, and before you could say "Al Capone" the roof of the shed slid back and they began to move upward at a terrific rate of speed.	Thereupon the boys from the Syndicate sat down and declared the Martians in for a fifty-fifty partnership, which means they actually gave them one per cent, which is generous at that.	It went to Mars.	"You can take graft, can't you?	When they spoke with a certain expression, the mobsters let go with 45s, which, however, merely have a stunning effect on the gent on the receiving end because of the lesser gravity.	The outward trip took a week, but it was spent pleasantly.	Blondes made Martians higher even than sugar, and brought larger and quicker returns.	The Crime Cartel met in Cleveland--in the third floor front of a tenement on Mayfield Road.	_GAMBLING_: Until the arrival of the Mafia, gambling on Mars was confined to a simple game played with children's jacks.	"Oh, I assume you mean girls.	With such odds, it was not necessary to fake the games more than is customary on Earth.	Where was it all going?	The Communist battle cry was: "Men of Mars unite; you have nothing to lose but your wives."	So it came out a dead heat.	Though anyway why should they travel?	On the other hand, the gravity is considerably less than on Earth.	It was snapped up as fast as it arrived.	There are four separate nations there, though nation is hardly the word.	The sighting plate thereon is centered around      two crossed hairs.	The next step was to corrupt the border guards, which was easy with Annie Oakleys to do the burlesque shows.	It cured the hangover from sugar.	When the organization heard about this, an investigation was ordered.	Chocolate bars are as common on Mars as saloons are on Broadway, and it is not unusual to see "gone" Martians getting heaved out of these bars right into the gutter.	Martian language is unlike anything ever heard below.
