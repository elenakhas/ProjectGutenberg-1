There was an awful hollow agony in Jimmy's chest as he stared, a fear that was partly a soundless screaming and partly a vision of Uncle Al sinking down through the dark water and turning it red.	*       *       *       *       * The stillness was broken by a shrill cry from Pigtail Anne.	*       *       *       *       * There were no people in the city, but down the aerial streets shining objects swirled with the swift easy gliding of flat stones skimming an edge of running water.	He read the news item aloud, if an account so startling could be called an item.	he said sympathetically.	That meant Jimmy was the man in the family, and wore the pants, and nothing Pigtail said or did could change that for one minute.	Never let it be said that in a struggle between the sexes the men of the river did not stand shoulder to shoulder.	"Uncle Al doesn't think so.	When Jimmy looked up into the sky he could see all the blazing stars of space, with cottonmouths on every planet of every sun.	He was still running when the first blast came.	"Don't yell at me!"	Something was happening to Jimmy, nibbling away at the outer edges of the fear like a big, hungry river cat.	And Uncle Al was still swimming, fearfully close to it.	*       *       *       *       * The voice grew suddenly gentle, like a caressing wind.	Court lets dog pick owner!	I've a right to see what's going on in the world!"	Jimmy obeyed.	Uncle Al was shading his eyes too.	"We grew great and wise, Jimmy, but not quite wise enough to shed our human heritage of love and joy and heartbreak.	"Or like the eel of Earth's seas, Jimmy, that must be spawned in the depths of the great cold ocean, and swim slowly back to the bright highlands and the shining rivers of Earth.	"You see, Jimmy, you're not human in the same way that your sister is human--or Uncle Al.	Maybe we're being _watched_, Pigtail!"	"Go inside, Pigtail," Jimmy said, calmly.	Then the voice droned on.	Million dollar heiress elopes with a clerk!	Jimmy refused to be enraged.	But Jimmy did see the waterspout, spiraling skyward like the atom bomb explosion he'd goggled at in the pages of an old _Life_ magazine, all smudged now with oily thumbprints.	Out on the deck and running along the deck toward Uncle Al.	Jimmy, we've seen one!	"We knew we'd find you where life flows simply and serenely, Jimmy.	Caddis flies building bright, shining new nests, and dragonfly nymphs crawling up toward the sunlight, and pollywogs growing sturdy hindlimbs to conquer the land.	It is a long bold step from fireballs to flying saucers, Jimmy.	_Hurry!_" There was a strange lifting sensation in Jimmy's chest now.	"A star in the sky, you dope!"	"I'm not scared, Uncle Al," Jimmy pleaded.	The sky had to be dark with rain, and you had to feel scared, in fear of drowning.	To Jimmy it seemed more like a dazzling burst of light in the sky.	"Catch them before they harm Uncle Al!	Jimmy knew that a big blow could come up fast.	"You see, Jimmy, we wanted you to study the Earth people on a great, wide flowing river, far from the cruel, twisted places.	Deep in his uncle's face Jimmy saw an anger he couldn't buck.	She simply stopped thrashing in Uncle Al's arms, as though a great wonder had come upon her.	When the smoke cleared Jimmy could see the Harmon shantyboat.	Uncle Al was shooting now, his face as grim as death.	Not people like us, but people all the same.	But there were cottonmouths down there too, with death behind their fangs, and no love for the life that was crawling upward.	Jimmy stared at his sister, the paper jiggling in his clasp.	If you get hurt I'll go right on fighting!"	Especially the Uncle Als.	It made him think instead of a slowly turning wheel in the pilot house of a rotting old riverboat, a big, ghostly wheel manned by a steersman a century dead, his eye sockets filled with flickering swamp lights.	As the _Natchez Belle_ dwindled around a lazy, cypress-shadowed bend Pigtail Anne became a superior being, wrapped in a cosmopolitan aura.	Just as though a giant in the sky had trained a big burning glass on the Harmon brothers and whipped it back quick.	"Save Uncle Al!"	Very close to Jimmy, but larger, more powerful.	The voices began quietly, as though they had been waiting for a long time to speak to Jimmy deep inside his head, and didn't want to frighten him in any way.	Hurry!	"We are the Shining Ones, Jimmy!	Pigtail Anne saw the disk before Jimmy did.	Closer and closer the shining object came, until Jimmy could see that it was carrying a human infant that stared straight at Jimmy out of wide, dark eyes.	Slowly Uncle Al and Pigtail were drawn into the disk.	Then Pigtail's anger really flared up.	Jimmy, what do you mean?	"Don't you dare!	NEW FLYING MONSTER REPORTED                         BLAZING GULF STATE SKIES Jimmy snatched the paper and backed away from Pigtail, his eyes glued to the headline.	*       *       *       *       * It didn't sound like a shotgun blast.	You're growing up--we can see that!	Then, with mud sucking at his heels, Jimmy was clinging to a slippery bank and staring out across the river, shading his eyes against the glare.	*       *       *       *       * Jimmy knew that the Harmons had waited a long time for an excuse.	But he was staring up the river, not down.	A tingling fear went through him, for he found it hard to realize that the disk had swept around the bend out of sight.	They watch the skies with sharper eyes, and their minds have groped closer to the truth.	Joe Harmon was small and stout, a little round man with bushy eyebrows and the flabby face of a cottonmouth snake.	She was Jimmy's little sister.	Stay where you are.	There was no deck for Uncle Al to sit upon.	Jimmy looked down into the river and then up into the sky.	"Take it easy, Jimmy!	Jimmy heard himself protesting.	We're going to take you across wide gulfs of space to the bright and shining land of your birth."	"You can be right smart when you've got nothing else on your mind, Pigtail," he said.	Just a roaring for an instant--and a big white mushroom shooting straight up into the sky.	Jimmy could see Uncle Al reclining in the web, with Pigtail in the crook of his arm, his long, angular body as quiet as a butterfly in its deep winter sleep inside a swaying glass cocoon.	"Sure as I'm a-standin' here.
