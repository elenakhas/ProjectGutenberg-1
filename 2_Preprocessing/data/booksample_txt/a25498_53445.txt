How he supplicates and whines,                  When he knows his fame is out,                  And sees springing into lines                  All the fables, shout on shout.	Now the storm is over,                        And the greener plain                        Seems to glow and hover                        Through the thinning rain.	Avis heard the beaten bell                  Break the quiet space,                  Gathering softly in the room                  Round her face;                  And the sound of wings                  From the deeps of rosy gloom                  Rustled in the place.	The moon is wrapped in a film,                  She looks wan and chill:                  Gather yourself in your cloak,                  The winter is over the hill.	From hazy hamlets, one by one,                    Beyond the island bars,                    The casements in the setting sun                    Flash back in violet stars.	Then shaking out her lawny sails,             Forth on the misty sea she crept;             She left the dawning of the dales,             Yet in his cloak the piper slept.	Whoo—whoo—                     The frost in the furrow,                     Heat takes long to burrow,                     The fire on the hearth                     Shakes its mirth                     At one of God’s poor,                     Outside the door,                       Whoo—whoo;—yu-loô—yu-loô.	The very flowers are musing                  On something they longed to be,                  In a land of peace and promise,                  In a province of the sea.	When the bloodroot blows in the tangle,                 And the lithe brooks run,                 And the violets gleam and spangle                 The glades in the golden sun,                 The showers are bright as the sunlight,                 April has won.	I.	Night in the valley,                    Gloom on the mountain,                    Wind in the wheat,                    Far to the southward                    The flutter of lightning,                    The shudder of thunder;                    But high at the zenith,                    A cluster of stars                    Glimmers and throbs                    In the grasp of the midnight,                    Steady and absolute,                    Ancient and sure.	Here is pleasure; drink it down.	The darkness is glooming and brightening,              There is alternate chaos and form,              With the parry and thrust of the lightning              In the turbulent heart of the storm.	Tendrils of or and azure creep,             And globes of amber light are rolled,             And in the gloaming of the deep             Their eyes are starry pits of gold.	Sing me a song of the strawberry-bent,               Of the black-cap hiding the heap of stones,               Of the milkweed drowsy with sultry scent,               Where the bee drones.	EQUATION.	And the fighter to his trull                  Tells his version of the yarn;                  With his bull-brain all afire,                  Charges down the ruddy rag                  Of the world above his ire,                  Tramps the tale in slag and mire.	Still as a dream till nearly dawn,             The ship was bosomed on the tide;             The streamlet, murmuring on and on,             Bore the sweet water to her side.	A SONG.	Whoo—whoo—                     The steam from the thatches,                     The casement tawny in patches;                     Look not yet,                     You might never forget                     The ghost of breath,                     Or the leper Death,                       Whoo—whoo;—yu-loô—yu-loô.	Sing me a song of the early spring,              Of the yellow light where the clear air cools,              Of the lithe willows bourgeoning              In the amber pools.	Sing me a song of the crystal cage,              Where the tender plants in the frames are set,              Where kneels my love Armitage,              Planting the pleasant mignonette.	Bid him chirp and cry,                       “Everything must die,                       She is dead,”                       Now in exequy,                       All is said.	March wind rough                           Clashed the trees,                           Flung the snow;                           Breaking stones,                           In the cold,                           Germans slow                           Toiled and toiled;                           Arrowy sun                           Glanced and sprang,                           One right blithe                           German sang:                           Songs of home,                           Fatherland:                           Syenite hard,                           Weary lot,                           Callous hand,                           All forgot:                           Hammers pound,                           Ringing round;                           Rise the heaps,                           To his voice,                           Bounds and leaps                           Toise on toise:                           Toil is long,                           But dear God                           Gives us song,                           At the end,                           Gives us rest,                           Toil is best.	Her soul was chartered for great deeds,                 For gentle war unwonted here:                 Her spirit sought her clearer needs,                 An Empyrean atmosphere.	Then a storm of burnished doves                  Gleaming from the cote                  Flurried by the almonry                  O’er the moat,—                  Fell and soared and fell                  With the arc and iris eye                  Burning breast and throat.	He springs upon the trees,                  And he shakes the sleeping nest;                  And every little water-pool                  Has a troubled breast.	Laughter falling coolly clear,                  Widens air and broaches sun,                  Comes as healing to a fear                  But of self and shadow spun:                  Self, a lantern-candle, throws                  Hugeous spottings on the wall;                  Dance the tragic giant Oes,                  Rayed from pin-points punctured small,                  In the battered shadow-tin                  Fused of deed and circumstance:                  Coward in the gaping ring,                  Bound without and look within,                  Learn where fable flows and whence.	Heighten mind and heighten life,                  Heighten comment above lure,                  Heighten laughter above strife,                  Bred to scourge the fancy pure.	The sailors launched a sombre boat,             And bent with music at the oars;             The rhythm throbbing every throat,             And lapsing round the liquid shores,             Was that true tune the piper sent,             Unto the wave-worn mariners,             When with the beck and ripple blent             He heard that outland song of theirs.	The plains are leaping with shadows,              The highlands go out like a blot,              And over the eddying meadows              The rain is hurtled like shot.	Sing me a song of the fallen mast,                Of the sharp odor the pomace sheds,                Of the purple beets left last                In the garden beds.	When the sweet airs had fled away,             The piper, with a gentle breath,             Moulded a tranquil melody             Of lonely love and longed-for death.	And there a ship one evening stood,             Where ship had never stood before;             A pennon bickered red as blood,             An angel glimmered at the prore.	AUTUMN SONG.	(One of love without a word,                  Wan to look upon,                  One of fear without a cry,                  Cowering stone,                  And the dower of life,—                  Grief without a single sigh,                  Pain without a moan.)	Sing me a song of the shallow lakes,              Of the hollow fall of the nimble rill,              Of the trolling rapture the robin wakes              On the windy hill.	And then at evening came the bark             That stirred his dreaming heart’s desire;             It burned slow lights along the dark             That died in glooms of crimson fire.	About the coming on of dew,             The sails burned rosy, and the spars             Were gold, and all the tackle grew             Alive with ruby-hearted stars.	IN MAY.	ADAGIO.	She sank and sank by yard and mast,             Sank down the shimmering gradual dark;             A little drooping pennon last             Showed like the black fin of a shark.	“Avis!” soft the echo lay                  As the lute.	When the great day is done,             That seems so long,             So full of fret and fun,             Our little girl is in her cradle laid:             She takes the soft dark-petaled flower of sleep             Between her fragile hands,             Striving to pluck it:             And as the dream-roots slowly part,             She is not in possession of the lands,             Where flowered her tender heart,             Nor in this turmoil dire of cark and strife,             Which we call life,             The which, husbanding all our art,             We will keep veiled until the latest day,             And from her wrapt away:             Then when the drowsy flower             Has parted from the dreamful mead,             And in her palm lies plucked indeed,             When her dear breathing steadies after sighs,             And the soft lids have clouded the blue eyes,             A tiny hand falls on my cheek—             Lightly and so fragrantly             As if a snow-flake could a rose-leaf be—             And in the dark touches a tear             Which has sprung clear,             From eyes unconscious of their own distress,             At the deep pathos of such tender helplessness.	Dear God!	A robin in the morning,                  In the morning early,                  Sang a song of warning,                  “There’ll be rain, there’ll be rain.”                  Very, very clearly                  From the orchard                  Came the gentle horning,                  “There’ll be rain.”                  But the hasty farmer                  Cut his hay down,                  Did not heed the charmer                  From the orchard,                  And the mower’s clatter                  Ceased at noontide,                  For with drip and spatter                  Down came the rain.	So the story rolls and grows                  Crescive as a cloudy head,                  Budding silver in the blue,                  From black root of thunder bred,                  With the lightning splitting through.	It trails into a silver blur,                And hangs about the cherry tops                That sprinkle, with the wind astir,                In little sudden whirls of drops.	Like the kernels in quern,                        Each in turn,                        Comes to his hour,                        Nor fast nor slow:                        It is well: even so.	Then she heard within the vast                  Closure of the spell,                  Rolled and moulded into one                  Rounded swell,                  All the sounds that ever were                  Uttered underneath the sun,                  Heard in heaven or hell.	When the color is free in the grasses,                 And the martins whip the mere,                 And the Maryland-yellow-throat passes,                 With his whistle quick and clear,                 The willow is full of catkins;                 May is here.	It broke in many a crimson sphere             That grew to gold and floated far,             And left the sudden shore-line clear,             With one slow-changing, drifting star.	Now she dares the comic sprite,                  Laughter only comes to light;                  Ripples outward like a flag                  Over towers inviolate,                  Sparkles April as a brook,                  Breaks where sun and shadow flit;                  Laughter silver and secure,                  From the crystal wells of wit,                  Springing sanely, springing pure.	With the salt, cool wind in his wing,            And the rush of tears that tingle and start,            With a throb at the throat so he cannot sing,            He nestles him into my lonely heart.	Every subject stricken blind                  With black fearing of the Dame,                  Strained of nerve and lean of loin,                  Passes on the strangest talk,                  Like a counterfeited coin;                  And the fear of her is wild,                  Works like acid in the blood,                  And the man is worse than child,                  Saved by innocent hardihood.	Then will come the days of men,                  When the mind will govern power;                  When clear speech will spring again,                  Flower unto a lovelier flower;                  When dear laughter, victor browed,                  From her scorning of your Dame,                  Will play out a lambent flame                  Over life to saneness vowed.	Here at last is something good,                    Just to warm your flagging blood.	A storm from the mountain is coming,              With lightning and thunder and rain,              The wind is sweeping and humming              In the butternut trees on the plain.	The winds that on the uplands softly lie,       Grow keener where the ice is lingering still,       Where the first robin on the sheltered hill       Pipes blithely to the tune, “When Spring goes by!”       Hear him again, “Spring!	The birds cry out and are silent,                  They are dreaming once again                  Of the tawny-throated hollow,                  And the fern in the glen.	When Spring goes by.”                                  MARCH.	Only when the mind rings true                  To the deep-held undertone                  Heard where Nature moulds her young,                  Will the fancy fail to brew                  Noisome liquor for the tongue.	’Tis autumn and down in the fields                  The buckwheat is browning still:                  Gather yourself in your cloak,                  The winter is over the hill.	The rain is awake on the mountain,              ’T is lashing the forest afar              With fall of a shattering fountain              And the tramp and tumult of war,              With the drums of the detoning thunder,              And the clang in the bugles of wind,              With the gonfalons tortured asunder              By the rush of the host from behind.	Beneath the stars each sent to each             A message tender, till at last             The piper slept upon the beach,             The sailors slumbered round the mast.	A brook hung sparkling on the hill,             The hill swept far to ring the bay;             The bay was faithful, wild or still,             To the heart of the ocean far away.	Or she starts a quiet mouse,                  Feeding in the native cheese,                  And a wolf springs from the rind,                  Bloated out to what you please.	And often in the morning of the heart,            When memories are like crocus-buds in spring,            Thou hast up-builded in thy crystal soul            Immutable forms of things loved once and lost,            Or loved and never gained.	But here where human passions pulse in power,           She will transcend our Shakespeare’s art,           From Desdemona to a smothered flower,           Will leap the tragic heart.	ON THE MOUNTAIN.	Swarming like ants,                    The Idea for captain,                    No banners, no bugles,                    Only a terrible                    Ground-bass of gathering                    Tempest and fury,                    Only a tossing                    Of arms and of garments;                    Sexless and featureless,                    (Only the children                    Different among them,                    Crawling between their feet,                    Borne on their shoulders;)                    Rolling their shaggy heads                    Wild with the unheard-of                    Drug of the sunshine;                    Tears that had eaten                    The half of their eyelids                    Dry on their cheeks;                    Blood in their stiffened hair                    Clouted and darkened;                    Down in their cavern hearts                    Hunger the tiger,                    Leaping, exulting;                    Sighs that had choked them                    Burst into triumphing;                    On they come, Victory!	Beneath the pines he piped and swayed,             Master of passion and of power;             He was his soul and what he played,             Immortal for a happy hour.	I cherish and cherish my timid guest,            For oh, he has grown so dear to me            That my heart would break if he left his nest,            And dwelt in the strange land down by the sea.	And the comments run from “Pish,”                  To the most convenient curse,                  In the beggar’s damning purse.	Ah!	Sing me a song of the thyme and the sage,                Of sweet-marjoram in the garden gray,                Where goes my love Armitage                Pulling the summer savory.	can she ever forget me                  With a song of mine in her heart?	A song that will move with a memory                  Of something she loves best;                  A song that will throb at her waking,                  A song that will lull her to rest.	A deep bell that links the downs                    To the drowsy air;                    Every loop of sound that swoons,                    Finds a circle fair,                    Whereon it doth rest and fade;                    Every stroke that dins is laid                    Like a node,                    Spinning out the quivering, fine,                    Vibrant tendrils of a vine:                    (Bim—bim—bim.)	From knee to breast the water wore,             It crept and crept; ere they were ware             Gone was the angel at the prore,             They felt the water float their hair.	Then the prophet robin                  Hidden in the crab-tree                  Railed upon the farmer,                  “I told you so, I told you so.”                  As the rain grew stronger,                  And his heart grew prouder,                  Notes so full and slow                  Coming blither, louder,                  “I told you so, I told you so,”                  “I told you so.”                            THE DAME REGNANT.	THE WOLF.	Their eyes are ruby in the green             Long shaft of sun that spreads and rays,             And upward with a wizard sheen             A fan of sea-light leaps and plays.
