No fount, however, appeared in England till 1667—the alphabets shown in the Introduction and Prolegomena to the London _Polyglot_ in 1655 and 1657 being cut on wood.	The punches were sealed up in an earthen pot, possibly to protect them from rust or injury; or possibly, because having once served their purpose in striking the matrices, they were put aside as of little or no use.

In 1841, the firm took its present style of Stephenson, Blake & Co.

It had been preceded in 1760 by some very elegant editions of the _Book of Common Prayer_,[566] all published at Cambridge in his capacity of University printer.

Those gentlemen who are inclined to encourage so      pleasing an improvement may, by favouring her with their commands,      be now supplied with Baskerville’s elegant types at no higher      expence than the prices already established in the trade.”[579]      _April 6, 1775._ The following further advertisement intimates that two years later the typefounding business was still carried on under the same management:―      “The late Mr. Baskerville, having taken some pains to establish      and perfect a Letter-foundry for the more readily casting of      Printing-types for sale, and as the undertaking was finished      but a little before his death, it is now become necessary for      his widow, Mrs. Baskerville, to inform all Printers that she      continues the same business, and has now ready for sale, a large      stock of types, of most sizes, cast with all possible care, and      dressed with the utmost accuracy.	8vo.

CARTON’S SYSTEM.	A boy then offered      himself to be bound; but no Warden being present, he was desired      to defer until next month, when several were bound; some freemen      made; and others admitted on the livery; one of whom, at least,      has frequently polled at Guildhall in contested elections.”[729] No particular notice appears to have been taken of the proceedings, and the rebellion was short lived.

Bower alone, and in 1841 the firm was Bower Brothers, who published _Proposals for establishing a graduated scale of sizes for the bodies of Printing Types, and fixing their height-to-paper, based upon Pica as the common standard_.	No complete specimen of his type remains later than that of 1803; although the numerous loose sheets which appeared after that date, and the fact that as many as 132 pages of composed specimens were left in type at the time of his death, show that one, if not several books had been issued during the interval.	.	The literary duel between the Caslons and the Frys was perhaps the least injurious outcome of this spirit.	“The Great Primer Script, which, it must be acknowledged, is the      _Ne plus ultra_ of every effort of the Letter Founder in imitation      of writing, was made for the Proprietor by the celebrated Firmin      Didot, at Paris; the Matrices are of Steel, and the impressions      from the Punches sunk in _inlaid Silver !_[643]      “In taking leave of a Profession, which has for many years      engaged his whole attention, the Proprietor begs to convey,      through this channel, the high sense of obligation he hopes to      retain during his life, for the great encouragement with which      he has been favoured for so long a period; as well as for the      generous assistance and advice of many of his learned Friends, in      the _getting up_, and accurate completion of various undertakings.	In 1574, however, metal types were provided, and several works were produced.	As was the case with the Roman letter, many of our printers at the close of the seventeenth century preferred the Dutch Greeks, which at that time were good, particularly those cut by the Wetsteins.	An apprentice sitting at the table completes the dressing, holding one end of the stick tilted while he passes his scraper over the front and back of the row of types.	.	_Cursive._―      Double Pica, ...

[633] The new style may have been considered an improvement at the time, but a later judgment has endorsed the regret with which Dr. Fry and others witnessed the then entire abandonment of the time-honoured and graceful Elzevir-cut characters of the first Caslon.	*       *       *       *       * Among the other peculiar characters cut by Moxon may be mentioned the symbols used in Mr. George Adams’ scientific works, and the Philosophic or “Real Character” designed by Bishop John Wilkins for his learned _Essay towards a Universal Language_, printed in 1668.	To accommodate himself to this fashion must have involved Mr. Figgins in a considerable sacrifice of his early labour and industry, and the circumstance may possibly account for the somewhat remarkable absence of any specimen bearing his name for a lengthened period.

According to the former, Thomas, John and George James were all brothers, and sons of the notorious half-crazy Elianor James, whose husband, Thomas James, the printer, was a large benefactor to Sion College, and died in 1711.

Amongst others, he cut a beautiful {323} fount of Pica Greek for Mr. Bowyer, “who,” says Nichols,[664] “used to say that the types in common use were no more Greek than they were English.” “He had also, under the direction of Joseph Steele, the ingenious author of _Prosodia Rationalis_,[665] augmented the number of musical notes by such as represent the emphasis and cadence of prose.” This curious work, designed to show how the recitation of Garrick and other eminent speakers might be transmitted to posterity in score, was printed by Nichols in 1779, being an amplified edition of a treatise published four years previously,[666] in which Jackson’s “expression symbols” were made use of.

At the same time, it is noteworthy that, whereas in many of the early decrees paper-making, book-binding and book-selling are distinctly mentioned, letter-founding is invariably ignored.	.

With the exception of the founts purchased at James’ sale in 1782 (which are distinguished by the initials), most of the characters were cut by, or under the direction of, Dr. Fry himself.	[166] This last-named work, which may be regarded as one of the first historical monuments of English letter-founding, contained a preface by Parker, in which {96} Day’s performance in cutting the punches is thus particularly alluded to:—“Jam vero cum Dayus typographus primus (et omnium certè quod sciam solus) has formas æri inciderit; facilè quæ Saxonicis literis perscripta sunt, iisdem typis divulgabuntur.”[167] The Saxon fount, as will be seen by the facsimile, is an English in body, very clear and bold.

Cottrell died, I am sorry to add, not in affluent circumstances, though to his profession of a letter-founder were superadded that of a doctor for the toothache, which he cured by {292} burning the ear; and had also the honour of serving in the Troop of His Majesty’s Life Guards.”[597] The following is the summary of his foundry as gathered from his specimen book, together with the additional founts cut subsequently:― MR.
