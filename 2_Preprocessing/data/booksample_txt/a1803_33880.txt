I must have done it wrong."	"Don't be too sure," said the Owl.	Now-a-days Granny never picked a scrap for herself.	They're the glow-worms.	The fact is, it's the Land of Lost Toys.	To come and do the work for a pan of cold water!	"I mean, did it really happen?"	"'Give her a stiff neck!'	It was Tommy after all that set the water and caught him."	come to the point, please," said the Doctor; "you do go round the square so, in telling your stories, Deordie.	"He never told me," said Tommy.	"And I've heard folk say they've known those that have seen them capering round the gray rocks on the moor at midnight: but this is wonderful!	"How stupid!"	Look at that knife I gave you to hold last night, and that wood--that's my fault though, and so are those scraps by Granny's chair.	Sam had his back to Dot, and his face to the fire, over which indeed he had bent for so long that he appeared to be half roasted.	"I'm in a row," murmured the young lady through her veil; and the needle went in damp, and came out with a jerk, which is apt to result in what ladies called "puckering."	how obstinate boys are to be sure!"	They were a handsome pair, this lazy couple.	They were locked together by two grubby paws, and had each an armful of moss, which they deposited on the floor as they came in.	Your eyes are swollen with crying.	She understood it all at last, however, and the Tailor could not restrain a little good-humored triumph on the subject.	that's you, is it?'	Now imagine a toy-fair, brighter and gayer than the brightest bazaar ever seen, held in an open glade, where forest-trees stood majestically behind the glittering stalls, and stretched their gigantic arms above our heads, brilliant with a thousand hanging lamps.	For, in the Brownie habits of self-denial, thoughtfulness, consideration, and the art of little kindnesses, boys are, I am afraid, as a general rule, somewhat behindhand with their sisters.	said the Tailor.	"I found it."	As soon as I could, I sat up, and felt myself all over.	A little girl sat sewing and crying on a garden seat.	I had hardly touched the two little pillows (they had a meal-baggy smell from being stuffed with bran), when the woodwork gave way with a crash, and I fell--fell--fell-- "Though I fully believed every bone in my body to be broken, it was really a relief to get to the ground.	Oh!	He was very like my old Jack-in-a-box.	Did the spirit whose body was with the dead, stand that morning by the body whose spirit was with the dead, and pity him?	Oohoo!"	said she.	"She's in a regular muddle."	One day a message came to him to offer him two or three days' tailoring in a farm-house some miles up the valley.	When we reflect upon the kind friends who bought us with their money, and gave us away in the benevolence of their hearts, we know that for their sakes we ought to have been longer kept and better valued.	Though they are one's own," he muttered to himself, "and not bad ones, and I did hope once would have been a blessing."	Tommy was almost surprised to find the echo awake at this time of night.	Sometimes the Blessed Brownies will take up their abode with some worthy couple, cheer them with their romps and merry laughter, tidy the house, find things that have been lost, and take little troubles out of hands full of great anxieties.	Deor, you're pulling my hair out.	It had been an effort to Dot to leave the night-dress which she had hoped to finish at a sitting; but when she was fairly set to work on the glue business she never moved till the glue was in working order, and her face as red as a ripe tomato.	"'Take her to pieces and see what she's made of, if you please,' tittered a pretty German toy that moved to a tinkling musical accompaniment.	If you care for sad stories, there is another queer thing belonging to a child who died.'	asked Tiny in subdued tones, for the Doctor had paused again.	It is wonderful what a comfort Brownies may be in the house that is fortunate enough to hold them!	"Awfully jolly," said Deordie.	"Father's measure that has been lost for a week!"	No one is to sit on the stone, or put their feet on the grass; and when you're ready, I'll begin."	"It may be the Old Owl herself, and she knows, Granny says.	I shouldn't think of the bread a bit, if you told us about the Fairies.	"'Old and ugly!'	"And what are Brownies like, pray?"	I was the more reminded of the Dutch 'bosch' because, after wandering some time among the lighted trees, I heard distant sounds of music, and came at last upon a glade lit up in a similar manner, except that the whole effect was incomparably more brilliant.	If you have, the sooner you make your way home the better.'	"The mistress up at the farm is clever enough, I can tell you; and as she said to me, fancy any one that likes a tidy room, not liking a tidy coat!"	It's true, really."	He had a natural turn for mechanical work, and, backed by Dot's more methodical genius, he prolonged the days of the broken toys by skillful mending, and so acquired an interest in them which was still more favorable to their preservation.	I could stand up now quite well, and I wandered on till dusk in unwearied admiration.	I gave the lad a piece to measure by."	"What did he do?"	"You can't," said Tiny, with feminine contempt.	It's getting cold, and I am so tired!"	You don't mean to say you have any toys here?	"I can do it well enough," said Tommy, following his brother's example and getting up.	And this afternoon she was asleep in the cradle, and off they went, and when she awoke, _I_ must leave my work to take her.	"Nothing to cry about, at any rate?"	I mean to tell Mother that when Father wants any more pocket handkerchiefs hemmed, she had better put them by the bath in the nursery, and perhaps some Brownie will come and do them."	She neither tied up her locks, nor dried her eyes, however; for when one is miserable, one may as well be completely so.	Amateur toys are mostly very dowdy.	"'What are you doing?'	"Are there no Brownies but children?"	"Take your seats.	"A little fellow, they said;" answered the Farmer's wife, knitting calmly on.	I've had father's new pocket-handkerchiefs to hem, and I've been out climbing with the boys, and kept forgetting and forgetting, and mother says I always forget; and I can't help it.	"Bairns are a blessing," said the old lady tartly, "_I told you so._"        *       *       *       *       * "That's not the end, is it?"	How can you be such a silly little goose?"	I wish I were a big man, and could make a fortune.--Will that do, Granny?"	"'Whistles that boys make of elder sticks with the pith scooped out,' said the beetle.	"_Is_ Europe found?"	He was a good husband, but he had been a spoilt child.	'Why do they lend them to their grandchildren?	Meanwhile the poor Tailor came wearily down-stairs.
