Beauty!	XI           _She lies within an icy vault;           It glitters like a cave of salt.	How bitterly I've cursed it, oh, the Painted Desert knows,      The wraithlike heights that hug the pallid plain,      The all-but-fluid silence, -- yet the longing grows and grows,      And I've got to glut the Wanderlust again.	here on my morris chair      How I ache for the Northland!	.	XIV      Even as this line I write,      Do I know that she is near;      Happy am I, every night      Comes she back to bid me cheer;      Kissing her, I hold her fast;      Win her into life at last.	Sting, little light, the shadows back!	.	What opportunity unmissed?	.	_THE ICE IS JAMMED!_  We've _GOT_ to make the shore."	.	Sufferin' Caesar!	.	.	.	They ran a base line, sluiced an' yelled, an' everyone wuz glad,      Except the balance of the property, an' he wuz "mad".	That hit old Chewed-ear's funny side, so he lays back an' hollers:      "The day you raise a hair, old girl, you'll git a thousand dollars."	Yet oh, of power and conquest what a destiny is mine!	Here in those poor weak arms he died:      "Wolves will not get you, lad," I lied;      "For I will watch till Spring come round;      Slumber you shall beneath the ground."	XV      The Sun!	I've gone the grilling pace that cannot last;      With bawdry, bridge and brandy -- Oh, I've drank enough to kill      A dozen such as you, but that is past.	They haled him harshly to a vaulted room,      Where One gazed on him with malignant eye;      And in that devil-face he read his doom,      Knowing that ere the dawn-light he must die.	.	.	And if you came to our feast again, with its pomp and glee and glow,      I think you would sit stone-still, Tom Thorne, and see in a daze of dream,      A mad sun goading to frenzied flame the glittering gems of the snow,      And a monster musk-ox bulking black against the blood-red gleam.	Sudden the cloud of darkness left my brain;      A velvet bar of sunshine pierced the room,      And in that mellow glory aureoled      She stood, she stood, all golden in its gold.	.	Well, naturally all the boys soon tumbled to the joke,      An' at the Wow-wow's Social 'twas Cold-deck Davis spoke:      "The little woman's working mighty hard on Chewed-ear's crown;      Let's give her for a three-fifth's share a hundred dollars down.	.	How maddening she must have been!	In the distant, dinful town just a little drink to drown       The cares that crowd and canker in my brain;      Just a little joy to still set my pulses all a-thrill,       Then back to brutish labour once again.	Why do ye gape, ye fools!	The great sky soared exultantly, the great earth bared its breast,      All river-veined and patterned with the pine;      The heedless hordes of caribou were streaming to the West,      A land of lustrous mystery -- and mine.	The silence seems a solid thing, shot through with wolfish woe;      And rowelled by the eager stars the skies vault vastly back,      And man seems but a little mite on that weird-lit plateau.	Anarch of all earth-misery;           Beggar and tramp and shameless sot;           Emblem of ill, in rags that rot.	I come .	Hark!	The heavens smile.	.	Then my camp of a night;      Red and gold of the fire-glow, net afloat in the stream;      Scent of the pines and silence, little "pal" pipe alight,      Body a-purr with pleasure, sleep untroubled of dream:      Banquet of paystreak bacon!	O wistful women I have loved before my dark disgrace!	Oh if I falter, fail to fight,           Can you, dear comrade, blame me quite?"	He was long and slim and lean of limb, but strong as a stripling bear;      And by the right of his skill and might he guided the Long Brigade.	No, 'twas a freak, a fancy of the brain,      (Oh, but to-night I'll try again, again!)	That's Hell-gate Canyon right ahead; I know of old its roar,      And .	Here in my den it's quiet; the sea-wind taps on the pane;      There's comfort and ease and plenty, the smile of the South is sweet.	"Oh well I mind the sorry day you crossed the gurly sea;      'Twas like the heart was torn from me, a waeful wife was I.	Is it for dear one you have lost?	He neither moaned nor moved his head.	I can't get my bearings, I'm crushed and oppressed      With the haste and the waste of it all.	With right good will let's climb the hill,      And leave behind all sorrow.	_"Mother, there's nothing more to eat --           Why don't you go out on the street?	And then I looked to Julie Claire, and sore abashed was I,      For from the robes that covered her, _I -- HEARD -- A -- BABY -- CRY_.	No, 'twas a candle's trick, a shadow cast.	.	They rounded up old Chewed-ear, an' they broke it what they'd done;      Allowed they'd bought an interest in his chance of raisin' hair;      They yanked his hat off anxiouslike, opinin' one by one      Their magnifyin' glasses showed fine prospects everywhere.	For I think you are one with the stars and the sun,        and the wind and the wave and the dew;      And the peaks untrod that yearn to God, and the valleys undefiled;      Men soar with wings, and they bridle kings, but what is it all to you,      Wise in the ways of the wilderness, and strong with the strength of the Wild?	And looking back I must confess      I've little cause to feel elate.	The bannered pomp, the gleam, the splendid urge!	The meadows of the musk-ox, where the laughing grasses grow,      The rivers where the careless conies leap.	The evening sky was sinister and cold;      The willows shivered, wanly lay the snow;      The uncommiserating land, so old,      So worn, so grey, so niggard in its woe,      Peered through its ragged shroud.	The camp-fire's a confessional -- what funny yarns we spin!	.	He raised the head of the heedless Dead;       He fingered the frozen face.	Till, tired at last, in a brook close by,       He washed off every stain;      Then softly up to the radiant sky       He rose, a god again.	.	.	Oh, would you know how earth can be      A hell -- go north of Eighty-three!	.	Oh, to see a coral dawn      Gladden to a crocus glow!	"O hark the herald angels sing!"	.	some night the stars will gleam       Upon a cold, grey stone,      And trace a name with silver beam,       And lo!	For there's a tiny wooden cross that pricks up through the snow:      (Poor Little Moccasins!	I think you would hear the bull-moose call, and the glutted river roar;      And spy the hosts of the caribou shadow the shining plain;      And feel the pulse of the Silences, and stand elate once more      On the verge of the yawning vastitudes that call to you in vain.	from Julie Claire there came a wail of pain,      And then -- the rope grew sudden taut, and quivered at the strain;      It slacked and slipped, it whined and gripped, and oh, I held my breath!	X      Hark!	My lake has dreamed and loved since time was born;      Will love and dream till time shall cease to be;      Gazing to Her in worship half forlorn,      Who looks towards the stars and will not see --      My peerless mountain, splendid in her scorn.	*    *    *    *    *      'Twas in a ruder land, a wilder day.	They roped in "tanks" from far and near, an' every test was sure,      An' like a flame there ran the fame of Deep-hole's Cow-juice Cure.	I want to go back to my lean, ashen plains;      My rivers that flash into foam;      My ultimate valleys where solitude reigns;      My trail from Fort Churchill to Nome.	Maybe 'twas God's -- ah well, all's right.
