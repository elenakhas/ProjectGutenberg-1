When her father found fault because she would not have older people round her, as did Livia, she parried the paternal reproof by the neat rejoinder--"They will be older as soon as I am.	As I carefully study every word, I have heard with my ears the fury, the rage, the roar of the winds; I have heard the trembling of the mountain and the din.	I mean that your tears have often stung your conscience but not changed your will.	I deplore, if I may yet again make use of a phrase of Horace, that I must live "only from day to day.	The generals of great armies depend on those whom they seem to command, and, kept in check by their armed legions, they find the very soldiers who render them invincible also render them in turn helpless.	ludicrous anxiety and tragic neglect, to worry and trouble yourself about a time at which you may never arrive and in which you assuredly will not have long to stay, and yet to be quite oblivious of that end at which you cannot help arriving, and of which there is no remedy when you once have reached it.	It is a false boast of yours that she has held you back from base things; from some perhaps she may, but only to plunge you into evils worse still.	Moreover, while other passions attack me only in bouts, which, though frequent, are but short and for a moment, this one usually has invested me so closely that it clings to and tortures me for whole days and nights together.	But my conscience is witness, and knows what have been my desires, that never have I ceased to love with burning zeal the things eternal.	Tell me briefly what are the remedies I must use?	2, 62-3.	Augustine._ You are like people who on the slightest offence rake up all the old grounds of quarrel they ever had.	_S.	You seek too eagerly the praise of men, and to leave behind you an undying name.	It will tell you that you have never longed for spiritual health as you ought, but that, considering what great dangers beset you, your wishes were but feeble and ineffective.	"[48] And Cicero has not scrupled to affirm that "she is the mistress; of human affairs.	Yes, I will freely admit that I am not disposed for a moment to reject such examples, which are, for me, part of the luggage I carry daily in my mind; for it is a pleasure to me not only in such misfortunes as Nature or chance have already allotted me, but also in those which they may still have in store; it is a pleasure, I say, to have ever at hand such matter of comfort and consolation as I can obtain only from some truly cogent reason or outstanding example.	_S.	If you will steadily observe human nature, you will discover that in a general way it is content with very little, and, in your case particularly, there is hardly a man who needs less for his satisfaction, unless you had been blinded by prejudices.	_S.	To scrape through life on water and dry bread     That you may have a fortune when you're dead?	As you wish.	All the world owes this to itself, but especially such a man as yourself, who have so great a public to justify, and one which is always talking of you.	_Petrarch._ What kind of notes?	_S.	Augustine._ It shall be yours if you wish.	Do you put no difference between things so entirely opposed?	But such is your execrable habit--to care for what's temporal, and be careless for all that's eternal.	_S.	"[3] This is the saying, mark you, of one who know quite well that he was the prince of Latin oratory, and had already shown that he was not afraid to challenge Greece for the palm of literary glory.	For the rest, there is no one in his senses who does not see death one way or another, and in reality Cicero's word _prospicere_ means to see from afar.	I make no such demand on you as that.	I care as much for what the crowd thinks of me as I care what I am thought of by the beasts of the field.	_S.	All this destroys the soul accustomed to any better kind of life, banishes all serenity from a generous heart, and quite upsets the student's habit of mind.	Nothing, or almost nothing.	What but this was in her heart when, unmoved by my entreaties, unyielding to my caress, she safeguarded her woman's honour, and in spite of her youth and mine, in spite of a thousand circumstances that would have bent a heart of adamant, she stood her ground, resolute and unsubdued?	Augustine._ By all means say on.	But think like a man and with your wits about you; for fear lest while you are in the act of flying you be cunningly entangled, as not a few have been when Beauty's fascinating charm steals upon them by some little, unlooked-for channel, and then is fed and strengthened by evil remedies.	What I said was you must make it ready.	I said--or if, perchance, I am mistaken, I intended to say--that my wish was to use mortal things for what they were worth, to do no violence to nature by bringing to its good things a limitless and immoderate desire, and so to follow after human fame as knowing that both myself and it will perish.	I understand and agree with you and will act on your advice.	And do you suppose what has befallen so many others may not befall you?	_Petrarch._ Unless I am deceived, there is no man alive who is more often revolving this thought in his heart than I.	But if you would only make notes of the chief points in what you read you would then gather the fruit of your reading.	_S.	Think, moreover, what tasks on all sides are claiming your attention, and by which you may do far more good and deserve far more honour: how many things you have on hand, as yet uncompleted, to which it would be far better for you to return, and devote more time, instead of attempting them so perfunctorily as you have en doing lately.	The man who has one year of life possesses something certain though short; whereas he who has no such promise and lies under the power of death (whose stroke may fall at any moment), which is the common lot of all men--this man, I say, is not sure of a year, a day; no, not even of one hour.	Augustine._ Vex not yourself, I pray you, when you ought rather to rejoice.	Then listen.	I discern very clearly the fourfold passion of our nature, which, first of all, we divide in two as it has respect to past and future, and then subdivide again in respect of good and evil.	I am surely not so forgetful of myself nor so feather-brained as to let myself trouble about cares of that sort.	_S.	_S.	When I bid you think on your own whitening forehead, do you quote me a crowd of famous men whose locks were white also?	_Petrarch._ Of what use is desire, then?	Ever since you grew tired of your leafy trees, of your simple way of life, and society of country people, egged on by cupidity, you have plunged once more into the midst of the tumultuous life of cities.	So, if you ask one of this set of men for a definition of a man or of anything else, they have their answer quite pat, as the saying goes; if you press him further, he will lie low, or if by sheer practice in arguing he has acquired a certain boldness and power of speech, the very tone of the man will tell you he possesses no real knowledge of the thing he sets out to define.	For how often and often, longing to get well, and familiar with advice like this, have I tried this remedy of flight; and though I have feigned various other reasons for it, yet the end and aim of all my peregrinations and all my retirement to the country was this one thing--to become free!	Augustine._ Other people, I fancy, might say the same of theirs; for true it is that in all the passions, and most of all in this, every man interprets his own case favourably, and there is point in the verse though from a common poet--     "To every man his lady,        Then one to me assign;      To every man his love affairs,        And so let me have mine!	But this I do with such indifference that it is plain enough I only descend to such necessities because I am so obliged.	_Petrarch._ No, but of cupidity, and I do not believe there is a man in the world more free of this fault than myself.	Yet I know not where to begin, so many complications alarm me.	Why and wherefore, I ask, this perpetual toil, these ceaseless vigils, and this intense application to study?	_Petrarch._ I have already told you you were wasting your time.	[28] _Ã†neid_, ii.	And, moreover, what boots it that others shall approve what you have said if in the court of your own conscience it stands condemned?	Augustine._ Nor do I wonder, for you have endured its burden long enough.	My own remembrance tells mo that I have never loved anything to be ashamed of, and, on the contrary, have ever loved what is most noble.	[4] _S.	It is of the latter that Seneca was thinking when he wrote that maxim.	You admit, therefore, that the argument is just and the chain of reasoning valid, when we say that a perfect knowledge of one's misery will beget a perfect desire to be rid of it, if only the power to be rid may follow the desire.	_S.	_Petrarch._ I am sorry if I have in any way expressed myself arrogantly, but if the spirit is the true rule of one's deeds and words, then my own bears me witness that I intended nothing in that sense.	But I loathe and abominate profoundly everything that conceals from him the truth that old age is the port of departure from this life, and blinds him to the need of reflecting on death.	_S.	Augustine._ It matters little from whom you learned the truth, though it is a fact that the authority of a great master will often have a profound influence.	Is it not?	_S.	_Petrarch._ Unless I am deceived by acting as judge in my own cause, what you say is so true that I am often inclined to fear I am too wanting in what is due both to my sex and this age; wherein, as you doubtless observe, everything goes to the shameless.	I have observed that no man more than you abhors the manners and behaviour of the common herd.	75.	A public spectacle like this strikes the attention and touches the heart of mortal men; and what then they see in the case of another is brought home as pertaining also to themselves.
