Henri d'Effiat pressed, blushing deeply the while, his friend's hand,-- who hastened to have his doors closed.	Already had tumultuous scenes and conspicuous assassinations proved the monarch's weakness, the absence and approaching end of the minister, and, as a kind of prologue to the bloody comedy of the Fronde, sharpened the malice and even fired the passions of the Parisians.	All those who have noble hearts are indignant at this yoke; and at this moment, more than ever, we see misfortunes threatening us in the future.	He traversed the seas to gather a flower upon which I had trodden, and ran the risk of death to kiss and bathe with his tears the foot of this bed in the presence of two of my ladies-in-waiting.	"That is not the question," interrupted Gaston.	"Child that you are, how little do you yet know of the court!	"But," said De Thou, very gravely, "upon my honor, I do not know what you mean.	It is not she!"	Had they arrived in the night, they would not have been seen, which spoils the effect somewhat, to speak the truth (for I grant that daylight is detrimental to them), and we would only have heard the voice of the people 'Vox populi, vox Dei'.	The Louvre is attacked, and all the populace are arriving from the city, I have been told."	Open it fearlessly; do not tremble as I do."	"Do you know the end of his favorites?	"Because we should be sure that to-morrow morning he would be against us."	"Yes, 'par la corbleu'!"	"Yes, of course.	It is, above all, hatred of him which is to predominate in the cries, for that is the essential thing.	Yes, I think to-day is Sainte- Barbe."	"Why so?"	Believe me, I know him; and I have dearly paid for the knowledge of that dark soul.	He covered himself with the diamonds of the English crown to please me.	But this joy was far from being complete, for her heart was still troubled by many things, and, above all, by the presentiment of the regency.	D'Effiat had not ceased to observe Marie de Mantua, whose expressive countenance exhibited to him all her ideas far more rapidly and more surely than words.	behold,                And follow."	The Duchesse Marie de Mantua was seated on her right hand upon a stool.	look already who they run!	Public criers rushed about, red and breathless, throwing on the pavement and sticking up on the parapets, the posts, the walls of the houses, and even on the palace, long satires in short stanzas upon the personages of the time.	Here you are, my pet!	She cried, weeping like a child, that a pistol-shot had broken her shutters and her window-panes, and had wounded her; she entreated the Queen to send her into exile, where she would be more tranquil than in a country where they wished to assassinate her because she was the friend of her Majesty.	The other women had seen on a window the reflection of torches, and, imagining that the palace was on fire, threw jewels, laces, golden vases, and even the china, into sheets which they intended to lower into the street.	Ah, how handsome he is, the love, with his big collar!	It was truly a cry from the heart--an explosion of love, which reason could not restrain, and which escaped all bounds."	She ordered her women to open the door, and the Duchesse de Chevreuse, in her night attire, and wrapped in a great cloak, fell, nearly fainting, at the foot of her bed, followed by four of her ladies-in-waiting and three of the women of the bed-chamber.	"Very well, Monsieur, very well!	As a woman, as a wife, I could have wept over so mournful a position; but now see, as a mother, I do not weep.	I love him still in the past more than I could love him in the present.	I am sure that you have been misled and deceived."	The Queen seemed more at ease in her manner and language; and no longer preserving her severe and ceremonious immobility, she signed to the other persons present to approach her.	said he, with deliberation, "if you give orders, my sister, I will be the captain of your guards, on my honor, for I too am weary of the vexations occasioned me by this knave.	I was, on the contrary, nimble enough at the time of my journey to Italy; but then fear gives legs as well as wings."	"What, Madame!	If your desires are well regulated, they will not cause      you any torments; and if they are not so, you will be punished by      swoonings similar to those of Celadon, and the shepherdess Galatea,      whom the inconstant Hercules abandoned in the mountains of Auvergne,      and who gave her name to the tender country of the Gauls; or you      will be stoned by the shepherdesses of Lignon, as was the ferocious      Amidor.	The coolness of Anne of Austria, and this last severe observation, however, restored a little calm to this beautiful personage, who rose in confusion, and perceiving the disordered state of her toilet, went to repair it as she best could in a closet near by.	It must be said, Madame--yes, it is no longer time to blind ourselves to the truth, or to conceal it-- the King's illness is serious.	"It is Montresor and Monsieur's people," said Fontrailles.	By the way, it was not the fete of Sainte- Barbe I saw this morning?"	"What, all?"	"An asylum!	"It will be himself," interrupted M. de Bouillon, "for he seeks to be named regent; and I know that at this moment he contemplates taking your children from you, and requiring the King to confide them to his care."	And it is a treasure; for it is the blood of a man who lives no longer, but who lived for me.	"How?	said Fournier.	May God aid you then, Monseigneur, for man may not do it without institutions!	Their poverty weighed less heavily upon them while they contemplated the agitations of the rich.	"This, Monsieur," replied Fournier, "is very different from the affair at Loudun.	"I hope so, Madame, since you pray for me," continued Marie.	The severe and abrupt tone of M. de Bouillon did not surprise Anne of Austria; but she had always seen him more calm, and was, therefore, somewhat alarmed by the disquietude he betrayed.	"Absolutely all," repeated Montresor.	She said this in Spanish, and the mystery of this order, spoken in a tongue which the ladies did not understand, restored those in the chamber to their senses.	"I admit," continued Fontrailles, "that your Highness ordered nothing, but you permitted me to tell you that I foresaw that this night would be a troubled one about two o'clock, and I hoped that your astonishment would not have been too great."	Do you hear him, my brother, and do you not appear astonished?"	"Ah, would to God," she exclaimed, "that my son's mind was ripe for your counsels, and his arm strong enough to profit by them!	Never had Anne of Austria looked so beautiful as at this moment; and the enthusiasm she manifested electrified all those present, who needed but a word from her mouth to speak.	"Must I encourage you to speak?"	At every pistol-shot this timid Prince rushed to the windows, without seeing anything but some flambeaux, which were carried quickly along.	"They burned powder."	The people, imagining they recognized her, redoubled their cries at this moment, and shouted louder than ever, "Down with the Cardinal!	for these are of his accustomed works.	"It appears to me," replied De Thou, gravely, "that you drink it even to the very dregs."	As to courage, it is not the first time he has shown it.	I would not be stopped.	how do we stand?	"I am very cruel, am I not, Marie?"	A bronze lamp, of a gothic shape, struggling with the coming day, threw its red light upon a mass of papers and books which covered a large table; it lighted the bust of L'Hopital, that of Montaigne the essayist, the President de Thou, and of King Louis XIII.	"Ah!	cried the cloakmen, all at once.	Long live the King!"	"I would stake my head and my share in Paradise that no one has seen my features or called my by my name."	We come to ask an asylum for the day."	"You have been deceived, Marie.	"What do I hear?"	An hour later, when they came to tell her that the crowd only awaited a sign from her hand to withdraw, she waved it graciously, and with an air of satisfaction.	continued the Queen, in an extremely sweet voice, and caressing her like a child from whom one would draw an avowal.	It has cost me all the power of my rank, the pleasures of my age, the affection of my family and even the heart of my husband.
