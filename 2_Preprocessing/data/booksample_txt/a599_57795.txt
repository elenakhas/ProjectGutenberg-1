He has no dissociative faculty.	The second point marks an obvious error of detail; the first is too crude a statement to be accepted; to say that he failed because his genius was unsuited to tragedy is to tell us nothing at all.	These passages are comparable to the best bombast of Kyd or Marlowe, with a greater command of language and a greater control of the emotion.	So with Blake, his early poems are technically admirable, and their originality is in an occasional rhythm.	“The beauty of Swinburne’s verse is the sound,” people say, explaining, “he had little visual imagination.” I am inclined to think that the word “beauty” is hardly to be used in connection with Swinburne’s verse at all; but in any case the beauty or effect of sound is neither that of music nor that of poetry which can be set to music.	The Hamlet of Laforgue is an adolescent; the Hamlet of Shakespeare is not, he has not that explanation and excuse.	I do not propose to analyse the difference (it would be a valuable chapter in social history); the American solemnity, it is enough to say, is more primitive, more academic, more like that of the German professor.	But having dealt with three English writers of what may be called critical prose, one’s mind becomes conscious of the fact that they have something in common, and, trying to perceive more clearly what this community is, and suspecting that it is a national quality, one is impelled to meditate upon the strongest contrast possible.	None of the obvious complaints that were or might have been brought to bear upon the first _Poems and Ballads_ holds good.	The alteration is not complete enough, however, to be convincing.	You cannot point to it in the speeches; indeed, if you examine the two famous soliloquies you see the versification of Shakespeare, but a content which might be claimed by another, perhaps by the author of the _Revenge of Bussy d’Ambois_, Act V. sc.	In sentimental drama it appears in a degraded form, when we are evidently intended to accept the character’s sentimental interpretation of himself.	And if literature is to Swinburne merely a passion, we are tempted to say that to George Wyndham it was a hobby, and to Mr. Whibley almost a charming showman’s show (we are charmed by the urbanity of the showman).	To have held the centre of the stage for two hours in a rôle which requires both extreme violence and restraint, a rôle which requires simple force and subtle variation; to have sustained so difficult a rôle almost without support; this was a legitimate success.	Swinburne’s words must always be referred back to Swinburne himself.	But from passages like the first we may be permitted to infer that Massinger was unconscious of trying to develop a different kind of character from any that Marlowe or Jonson had invented.	These poets were certainly obliged to consume vast energy in this pursuit of form, which could never lead to a wholly satisfying result.	And we have named three of Massinger’s best.	In order to fit into our estimate of Massinger the two admirable comedies—_A New Way to Pay Old Debts_ and _The City Madam_—a more extensive research would be required than is possible within our limits.	But such a nature was not at hand, and Massinger precedes, not another Shakespeare, but Milton.	Blake’s poetry has the unpleasantness of great poetry.	Wyndham was a Romantic; the only cure for Romanticism is to analyse it.	The point of view which I am struggling to attack is perhaps related to the metaphysical theory of the substantial unity of the soul: for my meaning is, that the poet has, not a “personality” to express, but a particular medium, which is only a medium and not a personality, in which impressions and experiences combine in peculiar and unexpected ways.	The critics of the romantic period were pioneers, and exhibit the fallibility of discoverers.	If you examine any of Shakespeare’s more successful tragedies, you will find this exact equivalence; you will find that the state of mind of Lady Macbeth walking in her sleep has been communicated to you by a skilful accumulation of imagined sensory impressions; the words of Macbeth on hearing of his wife’s death strike us as if, given the sequence of events, these words were automatically released by the last event in the series.	It employed all the conventions, the theatricalities, of the modern stage; yet her personality triumphed over not only Professor Murray’s verse but her own training.	Critics are often interested—but not quite in the nominal subject, often in something a little beside the point; they are often learned—but not quite to the point either.	There are some poets whose every line has unique value.	I’m not taken     With a cob-swan or a high-mounting bull,     As foolish Leda and Europa were;     But the bright gold, with Danaë.	(Tennyson, _Dora_) In _Faustus_ Marlowe went farther: he broke up the line, to a gain in intensity, in the last soliloquy; and he developed a new and important conversational tone in the dialogues of Faustus with the devil.	If you look at _Catiline_—that dreary Pyrrhic victory of tragedy—you find two passages to be successful: Act II.	We need some one—not a member of the Church of Rome, and perhaps preferably not a member of the Church of England—to explain how vital a matter it is, if Aristotle may be said to have been a moral pilot of Europe, whether we shall or shall not drop that pilot.	This leads us to the question of Humours.	Does the silkworm expend her yellow labours     For thee?	The bad poet dwells partly in a world of objects and partly in a world of words, and he never can get them to fit.	M. Julien Benda has the formal beauty which the American critics lack, and a close affinity to them in point of view.	And it appears to be satire.	For one thing, the stage appeals to too many demands besides the demand for art for that to be possible; and also we need, unfortunately, something more than refined automatons.	But at this point the impression is emotional; the reader in the ignorance which we postulate is unable to distinguish the poetry from an emotional state aroused in himself by the poetry, a state which may be merely an indulgence of his own emotions.	This impression may be so deep that no subsequent study and understanding will intensify it.	It is pertinent, at least, to remark that Marlowe’s “rhetoric” is not, or not characteristically, Shakespeare’s rhetoric; that Marlowe’s rhetoric consists in a pretty simple huffe-snuffe bombast, while Shakespeare’s is more exactly a vice of style, a tortured perverse ingenuity of images which dissipates instead of concentrating the imagination, and which may be due in part to influences by which Marlowe was untouched.	or to Professor Bradley?	From the point of view of literature, the drama is only one among several poetic forms.	_Massinger_: And now, in the evening,             When thou shoud'st pass with honour to thy rest,             Wilt thou fall like a meteor?	Largely on the evidence of the two Humour plays, it is sometimes assumed that Jonson is occupied with types; typical exaggerations, or exaggerations of type.	The French Intelligence As the inspection of types of English irresistibly provoked a glance at two American critics, so the inspection of the latter leads our attention to the French.	But almost no one, to-day, will wish to read the whole of Swinburne.	When it is a matter of pronouncing judgment between two poets, Swinburne is almost unerring.	But satire like Jonson’s is great in the end not by hitting off its object, but by creating it; the satire is merely the means which leads to the æsthetic result, the impulse which projects a new world into a new orbit.	and the superb “additions to Hieronimo.”[7] Footnote 7:   Of the authorship it can only be said that the lines are by some   admirer of Marlowe.	It is strange that Swinburne should have hinted at a similarity to Jonson and not mentioned a far more striking affinity of Chapman’s—that is, Donne.	He lived in no fairyland, but his mind went out and became a part of things.	Here, in fact, is our text: to elucidate this sentence would be to account for Massinger.	This is really a point of capital importance.	He exercises neither of the tools of the critic: comparison and analysis.	The scene in _Julius Cæsar_ is right because the object of our attention is not the speech of Antony (_Bedeutung_) but the effect of his speech upon the mob, and Antony’s intention, his preparation and consciousness of the effect.	We think of Shakespeare perhaps as the dramatist who concentrates everything into a sentence, “Pray you undo this button,” or “Honest honest Iago”; we forget that there is a rhetoric proper to Shakespeare at his best period which is quite free from the genuine Shakespearean vices either of the early period or the late.	The ability to perform that slight distortion of _all_ the elements in the world of a play or a story, so that this world is complete in itself, which was given to Marlowe and Jonson (and to Rabelais) and which is prerequisite to great farce, was denied to Massinger.	And we do not quite say that the new is more valuable because it fits in; but its fitting in is a test of its value—a test, it is true, which can only be slowly and cautiously applied, for we are none of us infallible judges of conformity.	In the _Agamemnon_, the artistic emotion approximates to the emotion of an actual spectator; in _Othello_ to the emotion of the protagonist himself.	As for the last alternative, it is not to be entertained; as for the second, what type do we prefer?	And as it recalls other scenes—there is a suggestion of the college of ladies in _The Silent Woman_—it looks like a comedy scene.	And it is at the same time what makes a writer most acutely conscious of his place in time, of his contemporaneity.	There remains to define this process of depersonalization and its relation to the sense of tradition.	And as in France, so in England, the more farcical comedy was the more serious.	Such men as Tylor, and Robertson Smith, and Wilhelm Wundt, who early fertilized the soil, would hardly recognize the resulting vegetation; and indeed poor Wundt’s _Völkerpsychologie_ was a musty relic before it was translated.	Or he might have studied through the literature to the mind of that century; he might, by dissection and analysis, have helped us to some insight into the feeling and thought which we seem to have left so far away.	The usual conclusion is either that “conditions” are too much for us, or that we really prefer other types of literature, or simply that we are uninspired.	The verse of _Edward III_ deserves study.	_Shakespeare_: ’Tis in my memory locked,               And you yourself shall keep the key of it.	The meanings which it has been obliged to shoulder have been mostly opprobrious; but if a precise meaning can be found for it this meaning may occasionally represent a virtue.	[5] Footnote 5:   I should except _The Dynasts_.	But at least Marlowe has, in a few words, concentrated him into a statement.	One is by isolating the essential, by pointing out the most intense in various kinds and separating it from the accidents of environment.	The words fall with as determined beat as if they were the will of the morose Dictator himself.	In the indefinable touches which make up the music of a verse [says     Boyle], in the artistic distribution of pauses, and in the unerring     choice and grouping of just those words which strike the ear as the     perfection of harmony, there are, if we leave Cyril Tourneur’s     _Atheist’s Tragedy_ out of the question, only two masters in the     drama, Shakespeare in his latest period and Massinger.	And you may say: rhetoric; but if we are to call it “rhetoric” we must subject that term to a closer dissection than any to which it is accustomed.	If, then, we must be very careful in applying terms of censure, like “diffuse,” we must be equally careful of praise.	There are others who need be read only in selections, but what selections are read will not very much matter.	The inferiority of Massinger to Jonson is an inferiority, not of one type of art to another, but within Jonson’s type.	There is strength and energy, at least, in Marlowe’s _Amores_.	But we cannot believe that George Wyndham lived in the real world.	In the earlier drama these conventions are merely a framework, or an alloy necessary for working the metal; the metal itself consisted of unique emotions resulting inevitably from the circumstances, resulting or inhering as inevitably as the properties of a chemical compound.
