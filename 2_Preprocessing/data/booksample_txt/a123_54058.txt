II A widow of forty-five With a bitter, swarthy skin, To ha' 'ticed a lad o' twenty-five An' 'im to have been took in!	And still in my nostrils   The scent of her flesh, And still my wet mouth   Sought her afresh; And still one pulse   Through the world did thresh.	CRUELTY AND LOVE What large, dark hands are those at the window Lifted, grasping the golden light Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves           To my heart's delight?	I thought I could plunge in your spurting hotness, and be Clean of the cold and the must.--With my hand on the latch I heard you in your sleep speak strangely to me.	I expect you know who I am, Mrs Naylor!	A widow of forty-five As has sludged like a horse all her life, Till 'er's tough as whit-leather, to slive Atween a lad an' 'is wife!	'Tis a degradation deep to me, that my best Soul's whitest lightning which should bright attest God stepping down to earth in one white stride, Means only to you a clogged, numb burden of flesh Heavy to bear, even heavy to uprear Again from earth, like lilies wilted and sere Flagged on the floor, that before stood up so fresh.	As I stand on this hill, with the whitening cave of the city beyond, Helen, I am despoiled of my pride, and my soul turns fond: Overhead the nightly heavens like an open, immense eye, Like a cat's distended pupil sparkles with sudden stars, As with thoughts that flash and crackle in uncouth malignancy They glitter at me, and I fear the fierce snapping of night's thought-stars.	When you had gone Ah stopped behind on t' pad i' th' drippin wet   An' watched what 'er 'ad on.	No cause for surprise at all, my lad,     After lickin' and snuffin' at me, tha could Turn thy mouth on a woman like her--     Did ter find her good?	Yi, an' 'im that young,       Snapped sudden out of all     His wickedness, among       Pals worse n'r ony name as you could call.	--I dunna know, They on'y towd me it wor bad--     It would be so!	'Appen then you've 'eered?	And I shall know the stamp and worth     Of the coin I've accepted as mine, Shall see an image of heaven or of earth     On his minted metal shine.	RENASCENCE We have bit no forbidden apple,     Eve and I, Yet the splashes of day and night Falling round us no longer dapple The same Eden with purple and white.	Say "Yes," tha clown.	Yea and I long to see him sleep     In my power utterly, I long to know what I have to keep,     I long to see My love, that spinning coin, laid still     And plain at the side of me, For me to count--for I know he will     Greatly enrichen me.	Under the glistening cherries, with folded wings       Three dead birds lie: Pale-breasted throstles and a blackbird, robberlings       Stained with red dye.	Say no more, Liz, dunna thee,     I might lose my-sen. --I'll only say good-bye to thee, Timothy,     An' gi'e her thee back again.	--Is it a toss-up 'twixt thee an' me?	Let be that; there's some o' th' bad as we   Like better nor all your good, an' 'e was one.	And I in the fur of the world, and you a pale fleck from the sky, How we hate each other to-night, hate, you and I, As the world of activity hates the dream that goes on on high, As a man hates the dreaming woman he loves, but who will not reply.	Eh man, what a stubborn jackass thou art, Kiss me then--there!--ne'er mind if I scraight--I wor fond o' thee, Sweetheart.	Come out o' the way an' let me see,     Eh, there's no peace!	And I dared not enter, feeling suddenly dismayed.	A moment, like a wavering spark,     Her face lay there before my breast, Pale love lost in a snow of fear, And guarded by a glittering tear,     And lips apart with dumb cries; A moment, and she was taken again in the merciful dark.	III I am ashamed, you wanted me not to-night-- Nay, it is always so, you sigh with me.	The horses are untackled, the chattering machine Is still at last.	Ay, I did, but afterwards     I should like to ha' killed her!	Ah, only the leaves!	If she would come, I would gather up the warm hay from The hill-brow, and lie in her lap till the green Sky ceased to quiver, and lost its tired sheen.	Her breath flew warm against my neck,     Warm as a flame in the close night air; And the sense of her clinging flesh was sweet Where her arms and my neck's blood-surge could meet.	Out o' my way, childt--dear o' me, wheer     Have I put his clean stockings and shirt; Goodness knows if they'll be able     To take off his pit dirt.	IV Nay robin red-breast, tha nedna     Sit noddin' thy head at me; My breast's as red as thine, I reckon,     Flayed red, if tha could but see.	Eh, what a man!--an' that cobbly road,     They'll jolt him a'most to death, I'm sure he's in for some trouble     Nigh every time he takes breath.	Oh are you goin' to Underwood?	III =Men= Oh labourers, oh shuttles across the blue frame of morning, You feet of the rainbow balancing the sky!	COROT The trees rise tall and taller, lifted On a subtle rush of cool grey flame That issuing out of the dawn has sifted     The spirit from each leaf's frame.	A tough old otchel wi' long Witch teeth, an' 'er black hawk-eyes as I've Mistrusted all along!	I have been too much for you--Ah, I remember!	Touches the clasp with trembling fingers, and tries To put her ear to the painful sob of my blood, While her tears soak through to my breast,       Where they burn and cauterise.	And though it be love's wet blue eyes that cry To hot love to relinquish its desire, Still in their depths I see the same red spark As rose to-night upon us from the dark.	COLDNESS IN LOVE And you remember, in the afternoon The sea and the sky went grey, as if there had sunk A flocculent dust on the floor of the world: the festoon Of the sky sagged dusty as spider cloth, And coldness clogged the sea, till it ceased to croon.	Love is the great Asker,     The sun and the rain do not ask the secret     Of the time when the grain struggles down in the dark.	AWARE Slowly the moon is rising out of the ruddy haze, Divesting herself of her golden shift, and so Emerging white and exquisite; and I in amaze See in the sky before me, a woman I did not know I loved, but there she goes and her beauty hurts my heart; I follow her down the night, begging her not to depart.	When tha comes to the beechen avenue,     I'm warnin' thee o' summat.	I wish tha hadna done it, Tim,     I do, an' that I do!	he'll be comin' to tell thee his-s√®n       Wench, wunna he?	And now the moon Goes slowly out of the west, And slowly back in my breast My kisses are sinking, soon       To leave me at rest.	The ground is a little chilly underneath     The leaves--and, dear, you consume me all to an ember.	Those were the days When it was awful autumn to me, When only there glowed on the dark of the sky The red reflection of her agony,     My beloved smelting down in the blaze     Of death--my dearest Love who had borne, and was now leaving me.	An' if my landlady seed me like it,     An' if 'er clawkin', tiger's eyes Went through me just as the light went out     Is it any cause for surprise?	It's somebody's lies.	VIOLETS Sister, tha knows while we was on the planks   Aside o' th' grave, while th' coffin wor lyin' yet On th' yaller clay, an' th' white flowers top of it   Tryin' to keep off 'n him a bit o' th' wet, An' parson makin' haste, an' a' the black   Huddlin' close together a cause o' th' rain, Did t' 'appen ter notice a bit of a lass away back   By a head-stun, sobbin' an' sobbin' again?	Ah home, suddenly I love you, As I hear the sharp clean trot of a pony down the road, Succeeding sharp little sounds dropping into the silence, Clear upon the long-drawn hoarseness of a train across the valley.	--Yea, but I'm tellin' thee summat.	And we are smothered between the darkness, we close our eyes and say "Hush!"	God, lonely, put down His mouth in a kiss of creation, He kissed thee, O Man, in a passion of love, and left The vivid life of His love in thy mouth and thy nostrils; Keep then the kiss from the adultress' theft.	I'm not havin' your orts an' slarts.	So listen, I'm tellin' thee summat.	--'E says "Is it Arthur Holliday's?"	Though I'll see as 'e pays you, an' comes to the scratch.	Ah, here I sit while you break the music beneath Your bow; for broken it is, and hurting to hear: Cease then from music--does anguish of absence bequeath Me only aloofness when I would draw near?	I'm screetin' my-sen, but are-na goin'     To let iv'rybody see.	Wheers he hurt this time, lad?	Hast owt to say otherwise From what I've arranged wi' thee?	I slept till dawn at the window blew in like dust, Like the linty, raw-cold dust disturbed from the floor Of a disused room: a grey pale light like must That settled upon my face and hands till it seemed To flourish there, as pale mould blooms on a crust.	TRANSFORMATIONS I =The Town= Oh you stiff shapes, swift transformation seethes About you: only last night you were A Sodom smouldering in the dense, soiled air; To-day a thicket of sunshine with blue smoke-wreaths.	'An 'appen you might guess what I've come for?	For whenever I look thee i' th' face, I s'll see     Her face too.	--Dear o' me, say summat.	A moment ago She kissed me warm on the mouth, The very moon in the south Is warm with a bloody glow, The moon from far abysses Signalling those two kisses.	And the world all whirling   Around in joy Like the dance of a dervish   Did destroy My sense--and my reason   Spun like a toy.	To-morrow swimming in evening's vague, dim vapour Like a weeded city in shadow under the sea, Beneath an ocean of shimmering light you will be: Then a group of toadstools waiting the moon's white taper.	It's no toss-up 'twixt thee an' me.	Oh you who flash your arms like rockets to heaven, Who in lassitude lean as yachts on the sea-wind lie!	An' me as 'as kep my-sen Shut like a daisy bud, Clean an' new an' nice, so's when He wed he'd ha'e summat good!	--Which on us said you wor?	of the river     That will last for ever.	I durstna kiss thee tha trembles so,     Tha'rt frit o' summat.	Into the yellow, evening glow   Saunters a man from the farm below,   Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed   Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.	An' mind when crossin' the planken bridge,     Again I warn ye o' summat.	But the moon Never magnolia-like unfurled     Her white, her lamp-like shape.
