Pitched on his head, and pumped full of lead, was Dangerous Dan McGrew,    While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast      of the lady that's known as Lou.	McGuffy is showing a bunch of the boys how Bob Fitzsimmons hit;     The barman is talking of Tammany Hall, and why the ward boss got fired.	It makes us nutty; hang the astral chimes!	take back your spawn again.	In the long, long night, by the lone firelight,      while the huskies, round in a ring,    Howled out their woes to the homeless snows --      O God!	Then I ducked my head, and the lights went out,      and two guns blazed in the dark,    And a woman screamed, and the lights went up,      and two men lay stiff and stark.	The reeling ranks of ruin swept along!	There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star agleam to guide us,     And the Wild is calling, calling... let us go.	Oh, they shook us off and shipped us o'er the foam,    To the larger lands that lure a man to roam;     And we took the chance they gave     Of a far and foreign grave,    And we bade good-by for evermore to home.	Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.	Tarry not, and fear not, chosen of the true;         Lover of the Lone Trail, the Lone Trail waits for you._ The Pines    We sleep in the sleep of ages, the bleak, barbarian pines;    The gray moss drapes us like sages, and closer we lock our lines,    And deeper we clutch through the gelid gloom where never a sunbeam shines.	Don't you remember that golden dream, with never a hint of pain,     Of lives that would blend like an angel-song       in the bliss of the coming years?	There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,    With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;    It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say:      "You may tax your brawn and brains,    But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains."	_There are strange things done in the midnight sun          By the men who moil for gold;         The Arctic trails have their secret tales          That would make your blood run cold;         The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,          But the queerest they ever did see         Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge          I cremated Sam McGee._ My Madonna    I haled me a woman from the street,     Shameless, but, oh, so fair!	Ah!	Oh, to have fallen!	Drowned them like rats in my rivers, starved them like curs on my plains,    Rotted the flesh that was left them, poisoned the blood in their veins;    Burst with my winter upon them, searing forever their sight,    Lashed them with fungus-white faces, whimpering wild in the night;    "Staggering blind through the storm-whirl, stumbling mad through the snow,    Frozen stiff in the ice-pack, brittle and bent like a bow;    Featureless, formless, forsaken, scented by wolves in their flight,    Left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white;    Gnawing the black crust of failure, searching the pit of despair,    Crooking the toe in the trigger, trying to patter a prayer;    Going outside with an escort, raving with lips all afoam,    Writing a cheque for a million, driveling feebly of home;    Lost like a louse in the burning... or else in the tented town    Seeking a drunkard's solace, sinking and sinking down;    Steeped in the slime at the bottom, dead to a decent world,    Lost 'mid the human flotsam, far on the frontier hurled;    In the camp at the bend of the river, with its dozen saloons aglare,    Its gambling dens ariot, its gramophones all ablare;    Crimped with the crimes of a city, sin-ridden and bridled with lies,    In the hush of my mountained vastness, in the flush of my midnight skies.	He sees the sullen pass, high-crowned with snow,     Where Afghans cower with eyes of gleaming hate.	And though grim as hell the worst is, can you round it off with curses?	Eating his heart out with a wild desire,     One day, behind his counter trim and neat,    He hears a sound that sets his brain afire --     The Highlanders are marching down the street.	They rule the world.	"Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway;    From my ruthless throne I have ruled alone for a million years and a day;    Hugging my mighty treasure, waiting for man to come,    Till he swept like a turbid torrent, and after him swept -- the scum.	The waves tell of ocean spaces,     Of hearts that are wild and brave,    Of populous city places,     Of desolate shores they lave,    Of men who sally in quest of gold     To sink in an ocean grave.	What have I lost!	And ah, it's strange; for, desolate and dim,     Between these two there rolls an ocean wide;     Yet he is in the garden by her side    And she is in the garret there with him.	And hunger not of the belly kind, that's banished with bacon and beans,    But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it means;    For a fireside far from the cares that are, four walls and a roof above;    But oh!	Quatrains    One said:  Thy life is thine to make or mar,    To flicker feebly, or to soar, a star;     It lies with thee -- the choice is thine, is thine,    To hit the ties or drive thy auto-car.	When he's on the blazin' desert an' his canteen's sprung a leak,     An' he's all alone an' crazy an' he's crawlin' like a snail,    An' his tongue's so black an' swollen that it hurts him fer to speak,     An' he gouges down fer water an' the raven's on his trail;    When he's done with care and cursin' an' he feels more like to cry,     An' he sees ol' Death a-grinnin' an' he thinks upon his crimes,    Then he's like ter hev' a vision, as he settles down ter die,     Of the little ol' log cabin an' the roses an' the vines.	These are the simple facts of the case, and I guess I ought to know.	The Men That Don't Fit In    There's a race of men that don't fit in,     A race that can't stay still;    So they break the hearts of kith and kin,     And they roam the world at will.	Have you wandered in the wilderness, the sagebrush desolation,     The bunch-grass levels where the cattle graze?	The thought came back of an ancient wrong, and it stung like a frozen lash,    And the lust awoke to kill, to kill...      then the music stopped with a crash,    And the stranger turned, and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar way;    In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him sway;    Then his lips went in in a kind of grin,      and he spoke, and his voice was calm,    And "Boys," says he, "you don't know me, and none of you care a damn;    But I want to state, and my words are straight,      and I'll bet my poke they're true,    That one of you is a hound of hell... and that one is Dan McGrew."	Then cheer us for our glory now, and cheer us for our pain,     And cheer us as ye never cheered before."	but I'm weak -- since the bitter dawn, and never a bite of food);    I'll just go over and slip inside -- I mustn't give way to despair --     Perhaps I can bum a little booze if the boys are feeling good.	The wind is a mighty roamer;     He bids me keep me free,    Clean from the taint of the gold-lust,     Hardy and pure as he;    Cling with my love to nature,     As a child to the mother-knee.	The flags were drooping sullenly, the men forgot to cheer;     We waited, and we never spoke a word.	He seeks the lily-scented dusk beneath the orange tree;     His pipe in silence glows and fades and glows;    And then two little maids come out and climb upon his knee,     And one is like the lily, one the rose.	"Money was just like dirt there, easy to get and to spend.	Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway,    And I wait for the men who will win me -- and I will not be won in a day;    And I will not be won by weaklings, subtle, suave and mild,    But by men with the hearts of vikings, and the simple faith of a child;    Desperate, strong and resistless, unthrottled by fear or defeat,    Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat.	She sees a sea of faces like a dream;     She sees herself a queen of song once more;    She sees lips part in rapture, eyes agleam;     She sings as never once she sang before.	So we took to wine and drink and other things,     And the devil in us struggled to be free;    Till our friends rose up in wrath, and they pointed out the path,     And they paid our debts and packed us o'er the sea.	Sun, moon and stars give answer; shall we not staunchly stand,    Even as now, forever, wards of the wilder strand,    Sentinels of the stillness, lords of the last, lone land?	She ceases and is still, as if to pray;     There is no sound, the stars are all alight --    Only a wretch who stumbles on his way,     Only a vagrant sobbing in the night.	Oh, there is no chance!	They say:  "Could I find my proper groove,     What a deep mark I would make!"	A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;    And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God!	who made me, give me strength to face    The spectre of this bitter, black disgrace."	Have you suffered, starved and triumphed,      groveled down, yet grasped at glory,     Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?	I answered Her:  The choice is mine -- ah, no!	Well, the cherry bends with blossom and the vivid grass is springing,     And the star-like lily nestles in the green;    And the frogs their joys are singing, and my heart in tune is ringing,     And it doesn't matter what I might have been.	And you'll find us in Alaska after gold,     And you'll find us herding cattle in the South.	We pillar the halls of perfumed gloom; we plume where the eagles soar;    The North-wind swoops from the brooding Pole,      and our ancients crash and roar;    But where one falls from the crumbling walls shoots up a hardy score.	Ha, ha!	We traded in skins and whiskey, and I've often slept under the shade    Of that lone birch tree on Bonanza, where the first big find was made.	The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do things --     Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.	Far away, so faint and far, is flaming London, fevered Paris,     That I fancy I have gained another star;    Far away the din and hurry, far away the sin and worry,     Far away -- God knows they cannot be too far.	I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;    But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;    I was sick with dread, but I bravely said:  "I'll just take a peep inside.	Hark to the song where spheral voices blend:    "There's no beginning, never will be end."	I guess I'll play on the red.	And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;    Then "Here," said I, with a sudden cry, "is my cre-ma-tor-eum."	Plague-spots, yet tools of my purpose, so natheless I suffer them thrive,    Crushing my Weak in their clutches, that only my Strong may survive.	His eyes are dark with doom;     He hears the shrapnel shrieking overhead;    He sees the ravaged ranks, the flame-stabbed gloom.	I am one of you no longer; by the trails my feet have broken,     The dizzy peaks I've scaled, the camp-fire's glow;    By the lonely seas I've sailed in -- yea, the final word is spoken,     I am signed and sealed to nature.	Master, I've filled my contract, wrought in Thy many lands;    Not by my sins wilt Thou judge me, but by the work of my hands.	"On to the gates of Hell, my Gordons gay!"	*    *    *    *    *    In many a Highland home, framed with rude art,     You'll find his portrait, rough-hewn, stern and square;    It's graven in the Fuyam fellah's heart;     The Ghurka reads it at his evening prayer;     The raw lands know it, where the fierce suns glare;    The Dervish fears it.	Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no;      then he says with a sort of moan:    "It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold      till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.	I can hear them now.	so cramful of cosy joy, and crowned with a woman's love --    A woman dearer than all the world, and true as Heaven is true --    (God!	Alone, alone he paced his narrow room,     In the bright sunshine of that Paris day;    Saw in his thought the awful hand of doom;     Saw in his dream his glory pass away;     Tried in his heart, his weary heart, to pray:    "O God!	The red, red rose is faded now, and it's fifty years ago.	A drivelling, dirty, gin-joint fiend, the butt of the bar-room joke;     Sunk and sodden and hopeless -- "Another?	Then the music swelled to a crash of joy, and the lights blazed up like day,     And I held her fast to my throbbing heart, and I kissed her bonny brow.	Chance!	Cause and effect are grim, relentless powers.	It's so long dark, and I'm lonesome -- I'll just lay down on the bed;    To-morrow I'll go... to-morrow...	From out the mesh of fate our heads we thrust.	It's all decreed -- the mighty earthquake crash,    The countless constellations' wheel and flash;     The rise and fall of empires, war's red tide;    The composition of your dinner hash.	Everything hard but headwork (I'd no more brains than a kid),    A brute with brute strength to labor, doing as I was bid;    Living in camps with men-folk, a lonely and loveless life;    Never knew kiss of sweetheart, never caress of wife.	And glory crowns his life -- and now the end,    The awful end.	Each one a brand of this devil's land,      where I've played and I've lost the game,    A broken wreck with a craze for `hooch', and never a cent to my name.	Dissolute, damned and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,    Ye would send me the spawn of your gutters -- Go!	Rise up in the morning with the will that, smooth or rough,                                            You'll grin.
