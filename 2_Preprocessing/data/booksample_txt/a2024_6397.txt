His letters, speeches, and edicts, were all drawn up for him by others; though he could converse with elegance, and sometimes expressed himself in memorable sentiments.	He had long entertained a suspicion of the year and day when he should die, and even of the very hour and manner of his death; all which he had learned from the Chaldaeans, when he was a very young man.	Contemptuously abusing the patience of men, he never pronounced a severe sentence without prefacing it (489) with words which gave hopes of mercy; so that, at last, there was not a more certain token of a fatal conclusion, than a mild commencement.	The people shewed little concern at his death, but the soldiers were roused by it to great indignation, and immediately endeavoured to have him ranked among the gods.	The day before his death, he ordered some dates [835], served up at table, to be kept till the next day, adding, "If I have the luck to use them."	He was slain upon the fourteenth of the calends of October [18th Sept.], in the forty-fifth year of his age, and the fifteenth of his reign [837].	[800]  VESPASIAN, c. xii; TITUS, c. vi.	63, and Cicero against Verres, v. 18.	He made many innovations in common practices.	[806]  The residence of the Flavian family was converted into a temple.	[820]  See VESPASIAN, c. xiv.	We learn, however, that he was the son of a lawyer in the service of some of the preceding emperors, and was born in Rome, though in what consulship, or under what emperor, it is impossible to determine.	Inheritances, to which he had not the slightest pretension, were confiscated, if there was found so much as one person to say, he had heard from the deceased when living, "that he had made the emperor his heir."	He debarred infamous women the use of litters; as also the right of receiving legacies, or inheriting estates.	After he became emperor, he had the assurance to boast in the senate, "that he had bestowed the empire on his father and brother, and they had restored it to him."	Some say that he was the son of a freedman, (500) while others, without specifying the condition of his father, relate only that he was brought up by a freedman.	He sent two expeditions against the Dacians; the first upon the defeat of Oppius Sabinus, a man of consular rank; and (484) the other, upon that of Cornelius Fuscus, prefect of the pretorian cohorts, to whom he had entrusted the conduct of that war.	His prelusive sentiments are sometimes far-fetched, and converge not with a natural declination into the focus of epigram.	[813]  This was an ancient law levelled against adultery and other pollutions, named from its author Caius Scatinius, a tribune of the people.	[807]  The Stadium was in the shape of a circus, and used for races both of men and horses.	The unsupported allegation of any one person, relative to a word or action construed to affect the dignity of the emperor, was sufficient.	We meet with one of two hundred and sixteen lines; one, of two hundred and thirty-four; one, of two hundred and sixty-two; and one of two hundred and seventy-seven; a rapidity of composition approaching to what Horace mentions of the poet Lucilius.	But as posthumous character is always the most just, its decisive verdict affords the surest criterion by which this variegated emperor must be estimated by impartial posterity.	During eight months together there was so much lightning at Rome, and such accounts of the phaenomenon were brought from other parts, that at last he cried out, "Let him now strike whom he will."	Of this victory he had notice by some presages, before the messengers who brought the news of it arrived.	His corpse was carried out upon a common bier by the public bearers, and buried by his nurse Phyllis, at his suburban villa on the Latin Way.	For by so doing, ye will spare your own eyes, and the world will understand that I interceded with the senate on their behalf."	On the other hand, the senate was so overjoyed, that they met in all haste, and in a full assembly reviled his memory in the most bitter terms; ordering ladders to be brought in, and his shields and images to be pulled down before their eyes, and dashed in pieces upon the floor of the senate-house passing at the same time a decree to obliterate his titles every where, and abolish all memory of him.	The remaining compositions of this author are sixteen satires, all written against the dissipation and enormous vices which prevailed at Rome in his time.	The distinction of the hero is not sufficiently prominent; and the poem possesses not those circumstances which are requisite towards interesting the reader's affections in the issue of the contest.	Nos ire per omnem     (Sic amor est) heroa velis, Scyroque latentem     Dulichia proferre tuba: nec in Hectore tracto     Sistere, sed tota juvenem deducere Troja.	He went to the bath early, and made a plentiful dinner, insomuch that he seldom ate more at supper than a Matian apple [840], to which he added a (497) draught of wine, out of a small flask.	Statius himself affirms, in his Dedication to Stella, that the production of none of them employed him more than two days; yet many of them consist of between one hundred and two hundred hexameter lines.	The poems of Martial consist of fourteen books, all written in the epigrammatic form, to which species of composition, introduced by the Greeks, he had a peculiar propensity.	have you a mind to marry?"	841.	The various objects of animadversion are painted in the strongest colours, and placed in the most conspicuous points of view.	But while we remark the blemishes and imperfections of this poet, we must acknowledge his extraordinary merits.	The Silvae is a collection of poems almost entirely in heroic verse, divided into five books, and for the most part written extempore.	By this violent act he very much hastened his own destruction.	And when Titus advised him to take another wife, he answered him thus: "What!	537.	The secretaries of the quaestors having engaged in trade, according to custom, but contrary to (487) the Clodian law [815], he pardoned them for what was past.	To which replying, "I shall in a short time be torn to pieces by dogs," he ordered him immediately to be slain, and, in order to demonstrate the vanity of his art, to be carefully buried.	And it is no less remarkable, that, under all the violence and caprice of imperial despotism which the Romans had now experienced, their sensibility to the enjoyment of poetical compositions remained still unabated; as if it served to console the nation for the irretrievable loss of public liberty.	It is said that he lived to upwards of eighty years of age.	Disdaining the more lenient modes of correction, or despairing of their success, he neither adopts the raillery of Horace, nor the derision of Persius, but prosecutes vice and folly with all the severity of sentiment, passion, and expression.	It was general throughout the empire.	[816]  See VESPASIAN, c. iii.	[826]     Too many princes are not good.	At the earnest solicitation of his friends, he was afterwards induced to undertake his Institutiones Oratoriae, the most elaborate system of oratory extant in any language.	But he did not persist in the execution of this project.	Many persons have seen him often kill a hundred wild animals, of various kinds, at his Alban retreat, and fix his arrows in their heads with such dexterity, that he could, in two shots, plant them, like a pair of horns, in each.	[828]  He filled the office of consul seventeen times, which no one had ever done before him, and for the seven middle occasions in successive years; but in scarcely any of them had he more than the title; for he never continued in office beyond the calends of May [the 1st May], and for the most part only till the ides of January [13th January].	VI.	[810]  See VESPASIAN, c. xiv.	But Domitian, though wounded, making resistance, Clodianus, one of his guards, Maximus, a freedman of Parthenius's, Saturius, his principal chamberlain, with some gladiators, fell upon him, and stabbed him in seven places.	It is said that he was twelve years employed in the composition of this poem; and we have his own authority for affirming, that he polished it with all the care and assiduity practised by the poets in the Augustan age:     Quippe, te fido monitore, nostra     Thebais, multa cruciata lima,     Tentat audaci fide Mantuanae         Gaudia famae.--Silvae, lib.	Yet he never gave himself the trouble of reading history or poetry, or of employing his pen even for his private purposes.	In the beginning of his reign, he gave up the study of the liberal sciences, though he took care to restore, at a vast expense, the libraries which had been burnt down; collecting manuscripts from all parts, and sending scribes to Alexandria [839], either to copy or correct them.	That any consequential reference was intended by hactenus, seems to me plainly contradicted by the words which immediately follow, scit caetera mater.	Delicacy, and even decency, is often violated in the productions of Martial.	XXIII.	And turning to those who were nearest him, he said, "To-morrow the moon in Aquarius will be bloody instead of watery, and an event will happen, which will be much talked of all the world over."	He put to death a scholar of Paris, the pantomimic [816], though a minor, and then sick, only because, both in person and the practice of his art, he resembled his master; as he did likewise Hermogenes of Tarsus for some oblique reflections in his History; crucifying, besides, the scribes who had copied the work.	It is observed of this author, by Pliny the Younger, that, though his compositions might, perhaps, not obtain immortality, he wrote as if they would.	The mother died in the flower of her age, and the sons, at the distance of some time from each other, when their father was advanced in years.	[812]  This absurd edict was speedily revoked.	Amidst all the intemperance of sarcasm, his numbers are harmonious.	Being, therefore, in perpetual apprehension and anxiety, he was keenly alive to the slightest suspicions, insomuch that he is thought to have withdrawn the edict ordering the destruction of the vines, chiefly because the copies of it which were dispersed had the following lines written upon them:     Kaen me phagaes epi rizanomos epi kartophoraeso,         Osson epispeisai Kaisari thuomeno.	I hold my tongue."	But as Troy could not be taken without the aid of Achilles, Ulysses, accompanied by Diomede, is deputed by the Greeks to go to Scyros, and bring him thence to the Grecian camp.	of his life.	He brought before the senate some persona accused of treason, declaring, "that he should prove that day how dear he was to the senate;" and so influenced them, that they condemned the accused to be punished according to the ancient usage [821].	For upon the very day the battle was fought, a splendid eagle spread its wings round his statue at Rome, making most joyful cries.	In unity and greatness of action, the Thebais corresponds to the laws of the Epopea; but the fable may be regarded as defective in some particulars, which, however, arise more from the nature of the subject, than from any fault of the poet.	During the reign of the former of these emperors, no resentment was shown towards the poet; but he experienced not the same impunity after the accession of the latter; when, to remove him from the capital, he was sent as governor to the frontiers of Egypt, but in reality, into an honourable exile.	JUVENAL was born at Aquinum, but in what year is uncertain; though, from some circumstances, it seems to have been in the reign of Augustus.	XV.	It is no small encomium to observe, that, considered as extemporaneous productions, (504) the meanest in the collection is far from meriting censure, either in point of sentiment or expression; and many of them contain passages which command our applause.	[817]  Cant names for gladiators.	In this number were, Civica Cerealis, when he was proconsul in Africa, Salvidienus Orfitus, and Acilius Glabrio in exile, under the pretence of their planning to revolt against him.
