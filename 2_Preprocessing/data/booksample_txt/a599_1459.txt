I do not think that they will sing to me.	*         *         *         *  No!	A broken spring in a factory yard,  Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left  Hard and curled and ready to snap.	I grow old ...	The reminiscence comes  Of sunless dry geraniums  And dust in crevices,  Smells of chestnuts in the streets,  And female smells in shuttered rooms,  And cigarettes in corridors  And cocktail smells in bars."	"For everybody said so, all our friends,  They all were sure our feelings would relate  So closely!	"Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall  My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,  I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world  To be wonderful and youthful, after all."	I have seen eyes in the street  Trying to peer through lighted shutters,  And a crab one afternoon in a pool,  An old crab with barnacles on his back,  Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.	Why we have not developed into friends."	I have seen them riding seaward on the waves  Combing the white hair of the waves blown back  When the wind blows the water white and black.	I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark  Suddenly, his expression in a glass.	My smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac.	We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole  Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger tips.	And I have known the arms already, known them all--  Arms that are braceleted and white and bare  (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)	And I have known the eyes already, known them all--  The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,  And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,  When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,  Then how should I begin  To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?	Smoothed by long fingers,  Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,  Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.	"You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,  And how, how rare and strange it is, to find  In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,  (For indeed I do not love it ... you knew?	The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall  Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life."	This music is successful with a "dying fall"  Now that we talk of dying--  And should I have the right to smile?	I grow old ...	We have lingered in the chambers of the sea  By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown  Till human voices wake us, and we drown.	Hysteria  As she laughed I was aware of becoming involved in her laughter and  being part of it, until her teeth were only accidental stars with a  talent for squad-drill.	II  The morning comes to consciousness  Of faint stale smells of beer  From the sawdust-trampled street  With all its muddy feet that press  To early coffee-stands.	And I must borrow every changing  find expression ... dance, dance  Like a dancing bear,  Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.	Is it perfume from a dress  That makes me so digress?	you are not blind!	I keep my countenance,  I remain self-possessed  Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired  Reiterates some worn-out common song  With the smell of hyacinths across the garden  Recalling things that other people have desired.	I heard the beat of centaurs' hoofs over the hard turf  As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon.	Are these ideas right or wrong?	The memory throws up high and dry  A crowd of twisted things;  A twisted branch upon the beach  Eaten smooth, and polished  As if the world gave up  The secret of its skeleton,  Stiff and white.	In the palace of Mrs. Phlaccus, at Professor Channing-Cheetah's  He laughed like an irresponsible foetus.	Only the friendship and the sympathy  Of one about to reach her journey's end.	The dogs were handsomely provided for,  But shortly afterwards the parrot died too.	Perhaps it is not too late,  I shall sit here, serving tea to friends."	She smoothes the hair of the grass.	A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,  Another bank defaulter has confessed.	You have the key,  The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,  Mount.	I thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birch-trees,  And of Priapus in the shrubbery  Gaping at the lady in the swing.	Aunt Helen  Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt,  And lived in a small house near a fashionable square  Cared for by servants to the number of four.	To find a friend who has these qualities,  Who has, and gives  Those qualities upon which friendship lives.	...	But what have I, but what have I, my friend,  To give you, what can you receive from me?	His laughter was submarine and profound  Like the old man of the seats  Hidden under coral islands  Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence,  Dropping from fingers of surf.	Cousin Nancy  Miss Nancy Ellicot  Strode across the hills and broke them  Rode across the hills and broke them--  The barren New England hills  Riding to hounds  Over the cow-pasture.	And how should I begin?	"So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul  Should be resurrected only among friends  Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom  That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."	Memory!	I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.	Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,  Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?	And would it have been worth it, after all,  After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,  Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,  Would it have been worth while,  To have bitten off the matter with a smile,  To have squeezed the universe into a ball  To roll it toward some overwhelming question,  To say: "I am Lazarus, come from the dead,  Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all"--  If one, settling a pillow by her head,    Should say: "That is not what I meant at all;    That is not it, at all."	Do I dare to eat a peach?	Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;  The worlds revolve like ancient women  Gathering fuel in vacant lots.	My self-possession flares up for a second;  This is as I had reckoned.	Half-past one,  The street lamp sputtered,  The street lamp muttered,  The street lamp said,  "Regard that woman  Who hesitates toward you in the light of the door  Which opens on her like a grin.	*         *         *         *  And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!	So the hand of a child, automatic  Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.	Half-past two,  The street lamp said,  "Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,  Slips out its tongue  And devours a morsel of rancid butter."	Half-past three,  The lamp sputtered,  The lamp muttered in the dark.	--And so the conversation slips  Among velleities and carefully caught regrets  Through attenuated tones of violins  Mingled with remote cornets  And begins.	You will write, at any rate.	The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune  Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:  "I am always sure that you understand  My feelings, always sure that you feel,  Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.	I could see nothing behind that child's eye.	"And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?	With the other masquerades  That time resumes,  One thinks of all the hands  That are raising dingy shades  In a thousand furnished rooms.	Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.	And how should I presume?	Now when she died there was silence in heaven  And silence at her end of the street.	The burnt-out ends of smoky days.	Upon the glazen shelves kept watch  Matthew and Waldo, guardians of the faith,  The army of unalterable law.	We must leave it now to fate.	The Jew Of Malta  I  Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon  You have the scene arrange itself--as it will seem to do--  With "I have saved this afternoon for you";  And four wax candles in the darkened room,  Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,  An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb  Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.	"He is a charming man"--"But after all what did he mean?"	*         *         *         *  Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets  And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes  Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?	Six o'clock.	And when all the world came back  And the light crept up between the shutters,  And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,  You had such a vision of the street  As the street hardly understands;  Sitting along the bed's edge, where  You curled the papers from your hair,  Or clasped the yellow soles of feet  In the palms of both soiled hands.	III  You tossed a blanket from the bed,  You lay upon your back, and waited;  You dozed, and watched the night revealing  The thousand sordid images  Of which your soul was constituted;  They flickered against the ceiling.	I should have been a pair of ragged claws  Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.	III  The October night comes down; returning as before  Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease  I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door  And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.	Shall I part my hair behind?	And should I then presume?	"I have been wondering frequently of late  (But our beginnings never know our ends!)	--  "He has pointed ears ... he must be unbalanced,"--  "There was something he said that I might have challenged."	Among the windings of the violins  And the ariettes  Of cracked cornets  Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins  Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,  Capricious monotone  That is at least one definite "false note."
