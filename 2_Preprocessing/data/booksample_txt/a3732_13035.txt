So Bildad would not     share his toys Or lend them to     the other boys.	In spite of this,     if you'll believe, He wiped his nose     upon his sleeve!	[Illustration: Selfish with Toys] PERCY BINGG Percy Bingg,     when he's at play, Is almost always     in the way; In the room,     or in the street, Always under     people's feet!	He was a Goop;     and so are you If you are ever     selfish, too!	[Illustration: Obeying Slowly] GWENDOLYN De V. De WITT Miss Gwendolyn     De Vere De Witt Is having _such_     a sulky fit!	[Illustration: Acting Uncleanly] SUSIE SMALT "Oh," says little     Susie Smalt, "It is someone     else's fault!"	Hear her moan!--     Hear her howl!	Now isn't "won't"     the naughtiest word That anyone     has ever heard?	[Illustration: Not Wiping Nose] ELIAS E. McGUFF Elias Ethelbert     McGuff, Oh, he was rude     and he was rough!	Letting water     flood the sink?	Now isn't that     the rudest way A Goop could answer?	When spoken to,     she turns her eyes, And never answers     or replies.	I should say!	Nobody but a Goop     would do it; His mother'd scold him,     if she knew it.	[Illustration: Not Minding Mother] M. AND B. HOPPER Mother always     is distressed If you fidget     when you're dressed.	She hangs her head     and sucks her thumb-- You'd think that she     was deaf and dumb!	Hear her groan!	Hear her sniffle!	'Tisn't nice.	[Illustration: Whining] ROBERTO LEES How thoughtless was     Roberto Lees!	I think he was     a Goop--don't you?	Goops like that     annoy me much!	[Illustration: Restless while Dressing] AMANDA M. JAMES Amanda Minnesinger     James She called her sister     horrid names!	She liked to walk     through puddles; so, She always had     a cold, you know.	Oh, no!	Always pinching,     always poking, Alwyas feeling,     always stroking Things she has     no right to touch!	(For only thoughtless     children tease).	He _orders_     someone to, With "Get my hat!"	[Illustration: Not Eating Crusts] EZRA HECHT What in the world     would you expect Of a Goop whose name     was Ezra Hecht?	He used to pinch,     he used to poke, And called his rudeness     just a joke.	Always playing     with the books, Never caring     how she looks!	[Illustration: Handling Things] PERCIVAL B. SLOOP Just look at     Percival B. Sloop, A most unpleasant     sort of Goop; He pokes his fingers     in his nose And wipes his hands     upon his clothes; He does a lot     of things that you, I know, would never,     never do!	He teased the little     pussy cat, He teased the puppy!	He was a Goop     and didn't know!	But as _you_ aren't     a Goop, you try To keep your tootsies     warm and dry.	Hear her growl!	Andrew was     a Goop, I think; Otherwise he     would have known He should let     such things alone!	A sulky Goop     I really call As bad as those     who cry and bawl.	She acts so sluggish     and so sickly!	Goops like that     annoy me so!	Do you put     away your hat, And your coat,     and things like that?	Of _course_ he would     refuse to heed Or mind his mother--     yes indeed!	_You_ keep out     the way, I know!	[Illustration: Sulking] ADOLPHUS ELFINSTONE Adolphus Elfinstone,     of Nachez, Thought it was fun     to play with matches Until the little Goop     had learned It hurt a lot     when he got burned!	[Illustration: Throwing away Things] MASTER BILDAD A puppy, when he     gets a bone, Will keep it for     himself alone.	They have no manners,     that's a fact.	or, "Tie my shoe!"	Never knowing     Goops like her Ought to neither     talk nor stir!	Mandy Fish?	Or, are you     like Esau Pound?	Hear her snuff!-- See her--well,     I've said enough.	But _you_ must do     what you are bid.	Though Jumbo loves     to fuss and fight, _You_ know, of course,     it isn't right.	[Illustration: Teasing Animals] ANNIE A. LeGRAND The queerest Goop     in all the land Was Annie Annabelle     LeGrand; She often said     what wasn't true-- Which is an awful     thing to do!	[Illustration: In the Way] BETSY BIRCH Look at little     Betsy Birch, Always whispering     in church!	If you     don't speak right out, You are a Goop,     without a doubt!	He makes them drag     along the floor As if they weighed     a ton or more.	He _can't_ be careful,     I suppose!	He never looks     where he is going; He's always bumping     into chairs, And stumbling, when     he goes upstairs; He tips things over,     bumps his nose.	Only a Goop     would act that way And be dishonest     in her play.	Because she couldn't     have her way With other children     at their play.	Think of that!	[Illustration: Not Answering] ISABEL McCLUNG Do you ever     stick your tongue Out, like     Isabel McClung?	[Illustration: Crying Continually] LITTLE CORALIE Though Coralie     was small and sweet, She always, always     had wet feet.	A _little_ fire     is queer and curious; But soon it grows     quite big and furious.	[Illustration: Lying and Fibbing] MISS MACKADOO This is a Goop--     Miss Mackadoo; She never speaks     when spoken to.	[Illustration: Scuffing Feet] JOHN D. PELL When John D. Pell     wants something done, D'you think he _asks_     of anyone?	[Illustration: Ordering People] ESAU POUND When you're finished     with your play, Do you put     your toys away?	[Illustration: Snuffling and Sniffling] FELICIA ROPPS Funny, how     Felicia Ropps Always handles     things in shops!	[Illustration: Going Carelessly] MARY C. C. CALL Mary Carey     Cory Call-- Hear her cry and     hear her bawl!	[Illustration: Stealing Sweets] FREDERICK FISHER Freddie Fisher     fairly fussed When he came     to eat his crust!	says young     Amelia Pratt; "I won't do this!"	[Illustration: Playing with Faucet] ANNABELLA DAY How slow is     Annabella Day!	She's the goopiest     Goop of all, Mary Carey     Cory Call!	Oh, Anna, do be     prompt, and then, No one will call     you "Goop" again!	"_She_ began it!"	Just think of     Solomon McKim, And don't be slovenly     like him!	[Illustration: Getting Feet Wet] ANDREW CROSSETT Have you heard how     Andrew Crossett Meddled with the     water-faucet?	For he will snatch     and grab the toys Of all the little     girls and boys.	But we are honest,     you and I, We think it's wrong     to tell a lie!	If you fidget     like Miss Midget, Hopper, or her     sister Bridget.	[Illustration: Rough and Rude] SOLOMON McKIM I wonder if     you ever meet The Goop who always     scuffs his feet?	[Illustration: Calling Names] SUSIE KLEIN When e'er I hear     a puppy whine, I always think     of Susie Klein; I think of how     she hangs her head, She doesn't speak--     she _whines_, instead!
