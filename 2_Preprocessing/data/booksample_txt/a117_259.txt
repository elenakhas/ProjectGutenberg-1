Death!	Then 'twas "Turkey in the Straw" till your lips were nearly raw,       And you hurled your bold defiance at the Wild.	The men who can't remember when they learned to swing a pack,       Or in what lawless land the quest began;      The solitary seeker with his grub-stake on his back,       The restless buccaneer of pick and pan.	We built our boats and we launched them.	The riffles of his sluicing-box were choked with speckled earth,      And night and day he worked that lay for all that he was worth.	We were climbing up a glacier in the neck of a mountain pass,      When the Dago Kid slipped down and fell into a deep crevasse.	Ice, white ice, like a winding-sheet, sheathing each smoke-grimed wall;      Ice on the stove-pipe, ice on the bed, ice gleaming over all;      Sparkling ice on the dead man's chest, glittering ice in his hair,      Ice on his fingers, ice in his heart, ice in his glassy stare;      Hard as a log and trussed like a frog, with his arms and legs outspread.	They tended me and they brought me back to the world, and here I am.	Some day you'll look and see not; futile and outcast of men,       I shall be far from your pity, resting forevermore.	To think of the poor old mater awaiting her prodigal son.	_I met him later in a bar and made a gay remark           Anent an ancient miner and an option on the Ark.	When thieves and thugs fall out and fight there's fell arrears to pay;      And soon or late sin meets its fate, and so it fell one day      That Claw-fingered Kitty and Windy Ike fanged up like dogs at bay.	sharp-edged as a javelin, was that a woman's scream?	Thus toiled we, the army of fortune, in hunger and hope and despair,      Till glacier, mountain and forest vanished, and, radiantly fair,      There at our feet lay Lake Bennett, and down to its welcome we ran:      The trail of the land was over, the trail of the water began.	I am going to God's Country, where I'll live the simple life;       I'll buy a bit of land and make a start;      I'll carve a little homestead, and I'll win a little wife,       And raise ten little kids to cheer my heart."	"Then came I to a land I knew no man had ever seen,      A haggard land, forlornly spanned by mountains lank and lean;      The nitchies said 'twas full of dread, of smoke and fiery breath,      And no man dare put foot in there for fear of pain and death.	With every mile of sea and land his longing grew and grew.	She's as light as any fairy; she's as pretty as a peach;       She's mistress of the witchcraft to beguile;      There's sunshine in her manner, there is music in her speech,       And there's concentrated honey in her smile.	He twists the thong from off his poke; he swings it o'er his head;       The nuggets fall around their feet like grain.	Then there were days of drifting, breezes soft as a sigh;      Night trailed her robe of jewels over the floor of the sky.	Just a dollar to help me out, I know you'll treat me white;      I'll do as much for you some day .	Up sprang the red-haired Clancy, lean and eager of eye;       Loaded the long toboggan, strapped each dog at its post;      Whirled his lash at the leader; then, with a whoop and a cry,       Into the Great White Silence faded away like a ghost.	I thrust in its maw the Fount of the Law; I fended it off with the Book.	then calamity came.	I only could peer and shudder and fear--'twas ever so ghastly and still;      But I knew over there in his lonely despair        he was plotting me terrible ill.	God knows what I bore that night when he swore        and bade me make tracks from his claim.	He's the man from Eldorado, and he's had a bite and sup,       And he's met in with a drouthy friend or two;      He's cached away his gold-dust, but he's sort of bucking up,       So he's kept enough to-night to see him through.	Leaping and boiling and seething, saw we a cauldron afume;      There was the rage of the rapids, there was the menace of doom.	And strange it is; for, though they searched the river all around,      No trace or sign of black fox skin was ever after found;      Though one man said he saw the tread of HOOFS deep in the ground.	Was this he, Tellus, this marble?	Straight to his anvil he hurried; started his furnace aglow;      Heated his iron and shaped it with savage and masterful blow.	I'll lie in my cell and listen; I'll wish that I couldn't hear      The laugh and the chaff of the fellows swigging the canteen beer;      The nasal tone of the gramophone playing "The Bandolier".	Ah, yes, it's the finish.	It cries for its human tribute, but me it will never drown.	I hew and I launch my cordwood, and raft it to Dawson town,       Where wood means wine and women, and, incidentally, hell.	I thank you each for coming here; the happiness is mine--       And now, you thieves and harlots, take it all."	Where I have been won't matter; what I have seen I won't tell.	The Ballad of Gum-Boot Ben           _He was an old prospector with a vision bleared and dim.	Spring!	Night with its writhing storm-whirl, night despairingly black;       Night with its hours of terror, numb and endlessly long;      Night with its weary waiting, fighting the shadows back,       And ever the crouching madman singing his crazy song.	She flitted sweetly through his dreams, she haunted him by day,      She smiled through clouds of nicotine, she cheered his weary way.	I gazed at the coffin I'd brought for him,        and I gazed at the gruesome dead,      And at last I spoke:  "Bill liked his joke; but still, goldarn his eyes,      A man had ought to consider his mates in the way he goes and dies."	The roses and lilies yearned to her,        as swift through their throng she pressed;      A little white, fragile, fluttering thing        that lay like a child on his breast.	"I was sick, soul-sick, of the futile chase, and there and then I swore      The foul fiend fox might scathless go, for I would hunt no more;      Then I rubbed mine eyes in a vast surprise--it stood by my cabin door.	But I'll tell you now--and if I lie, may my lips be stricken dumb--      It's a MINE, a mine of the precious stuff that men call radium.	My blood seemed to freeze; I fell on my knees;        my face was a white splash of dread.	"The skin is mine, all mine," she cried; "I did the deed alone."	They came through the door, they came through the floor,        they came through the moss-creviced logs.	We joined the weltering mass,      Clamoring over their outfits, waiting to climb the Pass.	But the one that cooked my bacon was Grubbe, of the City Patrol.	I tried to refine that neighbor of mine, honest to God, I did.	On!	I'm up on the bally wood-pile at the back of the barracks yard;      "A damned disgrace to the force, sir", with a comrade standing guard;      Making the bluff I'm busy, doing my six months hard.	In the heat of the hearth-fire embers he heated the hideous Brand;      Twisting her fingers open, he forced its haft in her hand.	Then all at once he grabbed my gun and he put it to his head,      And he says:  "I'll fix it for you, boys"--them are the words he said.	"From the vastitudes where the world protrudes        through clouds like seas up-shoaled,      I held its track till it led me back to the land I had left of old--      The land I had looted many moons.	They know they've got him going; he is buying wine for all;       They crowd around as buzzards at a feast,      Then when his poke is empty they boost him from the hall,       And spurn him in the gutter like a beast.	They drank unto his wife to be--that unsuspecting maid;       They drank unto his children half a score;      And when they got through drinking very tenderly they laid       The man from Eldorado on the floor.	"_      "It's getting dark awful sudden.	We leapt from our benches.	God knows what I did he should seek to be rid        of one who would save him from shame.	Says he:  "Boys, here is where the shaggy North and I will shake;       I thought I'd never manage to get free.	I'll never forget that bitter dawn, so evil, askew and gray,      When they wrapped me round in the skins of beasts        and they bore me to a sleigh,      And we started out with the nearest post an hundred miles away.	"And strange though be, 'twas borne on me that land had lived of old,      And men had crept and slain and slept where now they toiled for gold;      Through jungles dim the mammoth grim had sought the oozy fen,      And on his track, all bent of back, had crawled the hairy men.	That night the wife of his bosom, the light of joy in her eyes,      Kissed him with words of rapture; but he knew that her words were lies.	So twenty years, with their hopes and fears and smiles and tears and such,      Went by and left me long bereft of hope of the Midas touch;      About as fat as a chancel rat, and lo!	The supercilious cheechako might designate them high,      But one acquires a taste for them and likes them by-and-by.	Livid-lipped was the valley, still as the grave of God;       Misty shadows of mountain thinned into mists of cloud;      Corpselike and stark was the land, with a quiet that crushed and awed,       And the stars of the weird sub-arctic glimmered over its shroud.	It's so in the town report.	"Who's for a juicy two-step?"	She slipped away as still he lay, she clutched the wondrous fur;      Her pulses beat, her foot was fleet, her fear was as a spur;      She laughed with glee, she did not see him rise and follow her.	But the Lord took pity on my pain, and He led me to the sea,      And some ice-bound whalers heard my moan, and they fed and sheltered me.	And one who defied it, a man of the Mounted Police;       Fought it there to a standstill long after hope was gone;      Grinned through his bitter anguish, fought without let or cease,       Suffering, straining, striving, stumbling, struggling on.	I started to tell of the horrors of hell,        when sudden his eyes lit like coals;      And "Chuck it," says he, "don't persecute me        with your cant and your saving of souls."	He grips the table tensely, and he says:  "Dear friends of mine,       I've let you dip your fingers in my purse;      I've crammed you at my table, and I've drowned you in my wine,       And I've little left to give you but--my curse.	At least they SAY that I did it.	it sounds so queer--       Alone, alone, alone!	The man who was fair as Apollo, god-like in woman's sight,      Hideous now as a satyr, fled to the pity of night.	By day it's a ruthless monster, a callous, insatiate thing,       With oily bubble and eddy, with sudden swirling of breast;      By night it's a writhing Titan, sullenly murmuring,       Ever and ever goaded, and ever crying for rest.	'Twas so far away, that evil day when I prayed to the Prince of Gloom      For the savage strength and the sullen length of life to work his doom.	Oh, how we flogged the horses, staggering skin and bone!	--           Father, where is our boy to-night?	But no; they brewed me the green-spruce tea,        and nursed me there like a child;      And the homicide he was good to me, and bathed my sores and smiled;      And the thief he starved that I might be fed,        and his eyes were kind and mild.
