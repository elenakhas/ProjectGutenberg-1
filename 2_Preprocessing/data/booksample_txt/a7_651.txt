At length the curtain rose upon       ‘Bombastes Furioso.’    In vain we roared; in vain we tried       To rouse her into laughter:    Her pensive glances wandered wide       From orchestra to rafter—    “_Tier upon tier_!” she said, and sighed;       And silence followed after.	“Good-night, old Turnip-top, good-night!	“If that be so,” she straight replied,    “Each heart with each doth coincide.	“What boots it?	In lodgings by the Sea.	And cannot friends be firm and fast,          And yet bear parting?	But what’s the use?”  (He heaved a sigh.)	Explain yourself, my man!”    “His name is Kobold,” said my guest:          “One of the Spectre order:    You’ll very often see him dressed    In a yellow gown, a crimson vest,          And a night-cap with a border.	Why not endure, expecting more?”    “Rather than that,” he groaned aghast,    “I’d writhe in depths of cavern vast,    Some loathly vampire’s rich repast.”                        [Picture: He groaned aghast]    “’Twere hard,” it answered, “themes immense    To coop within the narrow fence    That rings _thy_ scant intelligence.”    “Not so,” he urged, “nor once alone:    But there was something in her tone    That chilled me to the very bone.	“For five lang years, and five lang years,       I coorted thee by looks;    By nods and winks, by smiles and tears,       As I had read in books.	Let thy scant knowledge find increase.	And, sickened with excess of dread,    Prone to the dust he bent his head,    And lay like one three-quarters dead    The whisper left him—like a breeze    Lost in the depths of leafy trees—    Left him by no means at his ease.	You’re getting as familiar          As if you were my cousin!	“You’d find the bread improved, I think,          By getting better flour:    And have you anything to drink    That looks a _little_ less like ink,          And isn’t _quite_ so sour?”    Then, peering round with curious eyes,          He muttered “Goodness gracious!”    And so went on to criticise—    “Your room’s an inconvenient size:          It’s neither snug nor spacious.	“Say, can thy noble spirit stoop    To join the gormandising troup    Who find a solace in the soup?	FROM his shoulder Hiawatha    Took the camera of rosewood,    Made of sliding, folding rosewood;    Neatly put it all together.	“And if Bones plagues him anyhow—          Squeaking and all the rest of it,    As he was doing here just now—    _I_ prophesy there’ll be a row,          And Tibbs will have the best of it!”               [Picture: And Tibbs will have the best of it]    Then, as my tears could never bring          The friendly Phantom back,    It seemed to me the proper thing    To mix another glass, and sing          The following Coronach.	Good-night, old Turnip-top, good-night!”          A nod, and he was gone.	I’ll have no bonfires on _my_ floor—    And, as for scratching at the door,          I’d like to see you try!”    “The Third was written to protect          The interests of the Victim,    And tells us, as I recollect,    _To treat him with a grave respect_,          _And not to contradict him_.”    “That’s plain,” said I, “as Tare and Tret,          To any comprehension:    I only wish _some_ Ghosts I’ve met    Would not so _constantly_ forget          The maxim that you mention!”    “Perhaps,” he said, “_you_ first transgressed          The laws of hospitality:    All Ghosts instinctively detest    The Man that fails to treat his guest          With proper cordiality.	A while like one in dreams he stood,    Then faltered forth his gratitude    In words just short of being rude:    For it had lost its shape and shine,    And it had cost him four-and-nine,    And he was going out to dine.	“No need for Bones to hurry so!”          I sobbed.	He gazed upon the sleeping sea,    And joyed in its tranquillity,    And in that silence dead, but she    To muse a little space did seem,    Then, like the echo of a dream,    Harked back upon her threadbare theme.	“And hear dumb shrieks that fill the air;    See mouths that gape, and eyes that stare    And redden in the dusky glare?	[Picture: He ran to tell the King]    “When it was over, for a whim,          He ran to tell the King;    And being the reverse of slim,    A two-mile trot was not for him          A very easy thing.	Ye never telled me sae.”    Said—“Ladye dear,” and the salt, salt tear       Cam’ rinnin’ doon his cheek,    “I have sent the tokens of my love       This many and many a week.	That is, the Present Company.”    Baffled, she gave a wolfish bark:    He, aiming blindly in the dark,    With random shaft had pierced the mark.	[Picture: Next to him the eldest daughter]       Next to him the eldest daughter:    She suggested very little,    Only asked if he would take her    With her look of ‘passive beauty.’       Her idea of passive beauty    Was a squinting of the left-eye,    Was a drooping of the right-eye,    Was a smile that went up sideways    To the corner of the nostrils.	How shall I write in rhyme?	Where have you been by it most annoyed?	For truly, just as the genuine Epicure lingers lovingly over a morsel of supreme Venison—whose every fibre seems to murmur “Excelsior!”—yet swallows, ere returning to the toothsome dainty, great mouthfuls of oatmeal-porridge and winkles: and just as the perfect Connoisseur in Claret permits himself but one delicate sip, and then tosses off a pint or more of boarding-school beer: so also—    I NEVER loved a dear Gazelle—       _Nor anything that cost me much_:    _High prices profit those who sell_,       _But why should I be fond of such_?	He answered her he knew not what:    Like shaft from bow at random shot,    He spoke, but she regarded not.	“It’s not in Nursery Rhymes?	Instead          Of answering my question,    “Well, if you don’t know _that_,” he said,    “Either you never go to bed,          Or you’ve a grand digestion!	“The man that smokes—that reads the _Times_—    That goes to Christmas Pantomimes—    Is capable of _any_ crimes!”    He felt it was his turn to speak,    And, with a shamed and crimson cheek,    Moaned “This is harder than Bezique!”    But when she asked him “Wherefore so?”    He felt his very whiskers glow,    And frankly owned “I do not know.”                  [Picture: This is harder than Bezique!]	“The notion soon became a craze;          And, when it once began, she    Brought us all out in different ways—    One was a Pixy, two were Fays,          Another was a Banshee;    “The Fetch and Kelpie went to school          And gave a lot of trouble;    Next came a Poltergeist and Ghoul,    And then two Trolls (which broke the rule),          A Goblin, and a Double—    “(If that’s a snuff-box on the shelf,”          He added with a yawn,    “I’ll take a pinch)—next came an Elf,    And then a Phantom (that’s myself),          And last, a Leprechaun.	[Picture: First the Governor, the Father]       Next, his better half took courage;    _She_ would have her picture taken.	And must I then, at Friendship’s call,    Calmly resign the little all    (Trifling, I grant, it is and small)          I have of gladness,    And lend my being to the thrall          Of gloom and sadness?	“Don’t stir!” he cried.	I coorted thee by signs;    By sending game, by sending flowers,       By sending Valentines.	“_They_ are the ghost-nobility,          And look on _us_ with scorn.	And yet          I almost think it is—    ‘Three little Ghosteses’ were set    ‘On posteses,’ you know, and ate          Their ‘buttered toasteses.’    “I have the book; so if you doubt it—”          I turned to search the shelf.	Now _do_ be cool and take a nap!	Hurriedly he packed his boxes:    Hurriedly the porter trundled    On a barrow all his boxes:    Hurriedly he took his ticket:    Hurriedly the train received him:    Thus departed Hiawatha.	“Who can have patience with a man    That’s got no more discretion than          An idiotic goose?	So with a yawn I went my way          To seek the welcome downy,    And slept, and dreamed till break of day    Of Poltergeist and Fetch and Fay          And Leprechaun and Brownie!	The first two stanzas describe the two main words, and each subsequent stanza one of the cross “lights.” No.	Shall his fevered eye    Through towering nothingness descry    The grisly phantom hurry by?	“Wow, they were flimsie things!”    Said—“that chain o’ gowd, my doggie to howd,       It is made o’ thae self-same rings.”    “And didna ye get the locks, the locks,       The locks o’ my ain black hair,    Whilk I sent by post, whilk I sent by box,       Whilk I sent by the carrier?”    “They cam’ to me,” said that fair ladye;       “And I prithee send nae mair!”    Said—“that cushion sae red, for my doggie’s head,       It is stuffed wi’ thae locks o’ hair.”    “And didna ye get the letter, Ladye,       Tied wi’ a silken string,    Whilk I sent to thee frae the far countrie,       A message of love to bring?”    “It cam’ to me frae the far countrie       Wi’ its silken string and a’;    But it wasna prepaid,” said that high-born maid,       “Sae I gar’d them tak’ it awa’.”    “O ever alack that ye sent it back,       It was written sae clerkly and well!	And the yearning for _ME_                That thou wistfully weepest!	Out spake the boy in buttons       (I ween he wasna thin),    “Now wha will tae the parlour gae,       And stay this deadlie din?”    And they have taen a kerchief,       Casted their kevils in,    For wha will tae the parlour gae,       And stay that deadlie din.	The process is termed “setting” by Composers, and any one, that has ever experienced the emotion of being unexpectedly set down in a heap of mortar, will recognise the truthfulness of this happy phrase.	Well, never mind!	Tortured, unaided, and alone,    Thunders were silence to his groan,    Bagpipes sweet music to its tone:    “What?	“The Fifth is one you may prefer          That I should quote entire:—    _The King must be addressed as_ ‘_Sir_.’    _This_, _from a simple courtier_,          _Is all the Laws require_:    “_But_, _should you wish to do the thing_          _With out-and-out politeness_,    _Accost him as_ ‘_My Goblin King_!	Wrenched with an agony intense,    He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense,    And careless of all consequence:    “Mind—I believe—is Essence—Ent—    Abstract—that is—an Accident—    Which we—that is to say—I meant—”    When, with quick breath and cheeks all flushed,    At length his speech was somewhat hushed,    She looked at him, and he was crushed.	I asked the cause: the aged man grew sad:       They pointed to a building gray and tall,    And hoarsely answered “Step inside, my lad,             And then you’ll see it all.”                                 * * * * *    Yet what are all such gaieties to me       Whose thoughts are full of indices and surds?	“Don’t talk!” he cried, as I began          To mutter some excuse.	“I’ve often spent ten pounds on stuff,          In dressing as a Double;    But, though it answers as a puff,    It never has effect enough          To make it worth the trouble.	It is when I am with them I wonder most       That anyone likes the Sea.	The thought “That I could get away!”    Strove with the thought “But I must stay.	.	Farewell, farewell to hope,    If he should look this way, and if       He’s got his telescope!	Pray, why are all the cruets placed          Where nobody can reach them?	He would hold a scroll of something,    Hold it firmly in his left-hand;    He would keep his right-hand buried    (Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat;    He would contemplate the distance    With a look of pensive meaning,    As of ducks that die ill tempests.	She felt that her defeat was plain,    Yet madly strove with might and main    To get the upper hand again.	While, like broad waves of golden grain,    Or sunlit hues on cloistered pane,    His colour came and went again.	“Hounds _in full cry_ I like,” said she:       (Oh how I longed to snub her!)	He saw in dreams a drawing-room,    Where thirteen wretches sat in gloom,    Waiting—he thought he knew for whom:    He saw them drooping here and there,    Each feebly huddled on a chair,    In attitudes of blank despair:    Oysters were not more mute than they,    For all their brains were pumped away,    And they had nothing more to say—    Save one, who groaned “Three hours are gone!”    Who shrieked “We’ll wait no longer, John!	I hardly thought you       So absolute a fool.	“If Tibbs is anything like me,          It’s _possible_,” I said,    “He won’t be over-pleased to be    Dropped in upon at half-past three,          After he’s snug in bed.	While she dissected, word by word,    His speech, half guessed at and half heard,    As might a cat a little bird.	[Picture: The camera]       This he perched upon a tripod—    Crouched beneath its dusky cover—    Stretched his hand, enforcing silence—    Said, “Be motionless, I beg you!”    Mystic, awful was the process.	If so, why not?	And thus they give the time, that Nature meant       For peaceful sleep and meditative snores,    To ceaseless din and mindless merriment             And waste of shoes and floors.	“Perhaps,” he added, “to _your_ ear          That sounds an easy thing?	Why didn’t you enquire my name    The very minute that you came?”          I answered in a passion.	He marked the ripple on the sand:    The even swaying of her hand    Was all that he could understand.	Then I whispered “I see                The sweet secret thou keepest.	Her voice was very full and rich,    And, when at length she asked him “Which?”    It mounted to its highest pitch.	Such a ridiculous old chap          Was never seen before!	[Picture: In dressing as a Double]    “Long bills soon quenched the little thirst          I had for being funny.	There is no rest—in Venice, on    The Bridge of Sighs!” she quoted low       From Byron and from Tennyson.	Some desperate attempts were made       To start a conversation;    “Madam,” the sportive Brown essayed,       “Which kind of recreation,    Hunting or fishing, have you made       Your special occupation?”    Her lips curved downwards instantly,       As if of india-rubber.
