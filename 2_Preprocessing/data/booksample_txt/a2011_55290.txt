Peter.	O'Cal.	Bad form to make the pace hotter than the regular rate.	Glad.	Someone's ready to keep her.	Peter, oh, my dear, dear Peter!	You're lying now.	I can't ask you to marry me yet because I am not rich.	He leans back in the arm-chair, yawning and consulting his watch, glancing at Gladys, entrenched behind her book, again yawning and making up his mind to address her._ ***** Fred, (_nursing a grievance_).	Don't go.	By the way, you're here yourself, you know.	Mrs. G. Say yes to them, Peter.	That's my son.	I quite agree.	[_Peter appears outside door right, pulling it to him._ Peter (_off_).	Peter.	Fred.	Fresh air will do you good.	Fred.	Margaret stands left, in some confusion.	I begin to think you never mean to marry me.	Peter.	Comrade Garside, I offer my congratulations.	(_Slight pause._) Tell me this.	Ned.	Ned.	But I particularly want to go to the Club.	Freddie rises._ Fred.	We want workers.	[_Peter looks from one to the other like a caged animal._ Ned (_with genuine feeling_).	She will now.	Don't you believe it, miss.	Peter.	Glad.	Well, you can meet him.	Yes--there's money in it.	Mar.	Peter.	[_Shouts more fiercely._ Fred, (_helplessly irritable_).	As I'm strong and you're weak, I ought to win.	Jones.	Every night I can make myself the master of a mob.	Peter.	Peter.	(_putting his hand on Peter's shoulder_).	Gladys enters, meeting Jones' eye._ Glad.	All right.	Peter.	O'Cal.	You've missed your ehanee to speak.	Lady M. (_turning_).	Fate didn't mean us two to miss each other.	Mrs. Garside sighs heavily, rouses herself slowly, crosses and opens door.	Peter.	I'll lay the table.	Peter (_deliberately_).	We've our livings to earn.	I _am_ indisposed.	Peter.	Glad.	Peter.	He enters wearily, forgetting himself for a moment on seeing Margaret and speaking vigorously._ Peter.	Light wall colouring and carpet.	Glad.	I'll write.	Oh, what's the use of that?	I'm making money, Miss Mottram, and I'm going to make more.	(_Coming to chair right and sitting, Mrs. Garside is to his left, Margaret his right._) In a few days it _'_ull seem matter of fact enough to be Labour candidate for the division.	Fred.	Peter.	[_Enter Timson._ Timson.	My employment _is_ in your hands.	She knows she's not fit to go up with you, so she's trying to keep you where you are.	Peter.	Mrs. G. Then I think I'll go to my bed.	Bit of a responsibility for any face.	Fred.	Well, I do like to be generous.	Yes, my lady.	Mar.	Peter.	Oh, conscience is so much a matter of climate.	Do you want to very much?
