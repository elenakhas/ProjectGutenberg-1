Let’s go round to the scene of the crime.	The light died out of Mrs. Vandemeyer’s eyes.	But there it is, she can tell you nothing.” “But why, man?	I dare say we were a couple of young fools to take on such a job.	But it has, you know, really it has.” He smiled again in his tired way, and continued reflectively.	I was beautiful, you see--very beautiful----” “You are still,” said Tuppence with admiration.	But I soon altered my mind.	She thought a minute or two, then tapped Albert on the shoulder.	If you’ll help me, I’ll take you away from the lot of them.	He nodded as though she had answered.	Ask for Mr. Hersheimmer, and when you get him tell him to get Sir James and come on at once, as Mrs. Vandemeyer is trying to hook it.	But I thought maybe it was her back history you were after, and that you’d know where she was now?” “Well, we wouldn’t mind hearing her back history,” said Tuppence guardedly.	Stew?	There’s nobody to put Mr. Brown wise.” The lawyer shrugged his shoulders.	“Look there.	‘What’s he doing down here?	Julius nodded gravely.	“Child’s play to the masculine mind.” “I don’t mind admitting that for once you’ve scored handsomely.	“He’s--ah!” With a shriek of terror she sprang to her feet.	Ready Rita they call her in the States.” “Ready Rita,” repeated Albert deliriously.	He rang up the _Ritz_ and asked for Julius Hersheimmer.	“And _I_‘ll look after _you_,” retorted Tuppence, resenting the manly assertion.	“I think Mrs. Vandemeyer’s boudoir would be the most comfortable,” she said at last, and led the way there.	“Sure thing.” Tommy nodded.	His voice was very ordinary and quiet, but somehow, I don’t know why, he scared me worse than the woman.	Somehow, with the coming of the light, the dreads and fancies of the past night seemed absurd.	(You see, I can do it too.)	The immediate result of this set-back was to effect a _rapprochement_ between Julius Hersheimmer and the Young Adventurers.	It isn’t worth it.	It would do you no harm to do a little brain work too.” “My union, Tuppence, my union!	There was a strange gleam in her electric-blue eyes.	Now and then she nodded, and sometimes she’d shake her head, as though she were answering questions.	“She’s a hostage, that’s what she is.	What’s the best place to stay at for the night round here?” Mrs. Sweeny looked doubtful.	Vandemeyer came round the screen at once.	What have you been doing?” For a moment, Tommy stared at him.	So far it was all plain sailing.	Come on, Julius.	Won’t you save her from their clutches?” “You mean Jane Finn?” “Yes.” “It is her you came here to look for?	You shall not lose your lives because of me.	Dr. Hall turned an appealing face to Sir James, who smiled slightly.	We never know.	Mr. Carter must be warned.	It was so exactly what one expected that it gave the effect of being beautifully staged.	I--never heard of her!” “You’re a darned liar!	“I’ve got it!	Mrs. Vandemeyer passed her tongue over her dried lips.	It gave her a dreadful sense of kinship to the woman fronting her.	“I don’t understand.	There’s no humbug about her.	Sir James spoke first.	CHAPTER XXII.	She had arranged before leaving the _Ritz_ to have all letters or messages sent on at once by special messenger to a small stationer’s shop near at hand where Albert was to call in frequently.	When I begin to sing, watch that window.” He retreated hastily to a position on the main drive, and began in a deep roar, coupled with an unsteady gait, the following ditty:           I am a Soldier           A jolly British Soldier;           You can see that I’m a Soldier by my feet....	“Look!	“I rather wish that fellow would come along,” said Julius.	It’s a hundred to one against its being there!	‘So our young friend is coming round again.	If she had we’d probably never have traced her.	Now, shorn of its glamour, it seemed to be turning to grim reality.	Mrs. Sweeny’s got the key if you want to go over it--next to the post office.” Tommy thanked him.	After the torpedo struck the ship, in the few moments during the launching of the boats, Danvers was seen speaking to a young American girl.	It had.’ Then he went on to tell me something I _didn’t_ know.	You are sure that you did not in any way disclose your identity?” Tommy shook his head.	Here’s your ticket.	If so, you’re wrong.	As regards Annette he could do nothing.	He looked back with his kindly, shrewd glance.	A very urgent message arrived from Mrs. Vandemeyer.	“Danvers,” he murmured.	I had been studying French, and my teacher said they were wanting help in a hospital in Paris, so I wrote and offered my services, and they were accepted.	I’ve always jumped on sentiment--and here I am being more sentimental than anybody.	The square was deserted.	It was after that that Tommy proposed to give them a surprise.	They bowed before it.	“You have tied him up well, _hein?_ He is like a trussed chicken!” The frank amusement in her tone jarred on the boy; but at that moment, to his amazement, he felt her hand running lightly over his bonds, and something small and cold was pressed into the palm of his hand.	Will you step this way?” He ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished as a library.	They are quite right to keep you here.” “They’re a bad lot, Annette.	I don’t feel anything--no--say, what’s this?	The other hesitated.	THE next day passed slowly.	The American had announced his immediate departure, there would be no fear of running up against him.	Can you describe him at all?” “I really didn’t notice.
