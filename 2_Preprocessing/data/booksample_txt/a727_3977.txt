His old sister could not believe it.	"I have the proof of it now."	Unfortunately, right in the middle of the prospectus, the cafe closed.	And when, just at dinner-time, a box at the theatre or an invitation for the evening was sent to her from the floor below, while she was dressing, overjoyed at the opportunity to exhibit herself, she thought of nothing but crushing her rival.	The real fact concerning this affair of honor was that M. Chebe had given notice of his intention to leave the little house at Montrouge, and had hired a shop with an entresol in the Rue du Mail, in the midst of a business district.	In his present agitation and perplexity it was like the harbor with its smooth, deep water, the sunny, peaceful quay, where the women work while awaiting their husbands and fathers, though the wind howls and the sea rages.	While the fine weather lasted, the good people did not weary of admiring the sunsets behind the fortifications, the long days, the bracing country air.	Can you imagine it, I say?	But why bother one's head about all these spiteful creatures?	Their feeling at first when they were together was one of satisfied vanity.	So I      will come to the point at once.	The old peasant's gayety, for its freer expansion, needed little Sidonie, who did not take alarm at his jests.	That will be better for my health than all the excitement of the capital."	The tawdry glitter of the theatre, the red and gold of the hangings, were genuine splendor to her.	With her eyes staring into vacancy, her needle in the air, arrested in its pretty, industrious movement, she has gone away to the blue country, that wonderful country whither one may go at will, without thought of any infirmity.	Her electrified fingers moved with redoubled swiftness.	The whole establishment is alert.	Madame Chebe would smile softly without replying.	It often happened, toward night, that Georges's carriage, driving through the gateway, would compel Madame Risler to step hastily aside as she was returning in a gorgeous costume from a triumphal promenade.	"The most dismal things on earth," she used to say.	She bloomed among them like a pretty paper flower in a filigree jardiniere.	[They say that thou'rt to marry                     Thou know'st that I may die.]	It seems as if the oppression of the week's labor vanishes with the steam from the machinery, as it escapes in a hissing cloud of vapor over the gutters.	Madame requires too much.	One by one the workmen moved away from the grating, counting the money that glistened in their black hands.	He found there articles of furniture with which he had been familiar for twenty years, the portrait of his former employer; and his dear Madame Chorche, bending over some little piece of needle work at his side, seemed to him even younger and more lovable among all those old souvenirs.	It is a commission intrusted to me by a friend."	"Mouri-i-i-i-i-r!"	A man ought to be on the spot, always on the spot, in the breach.	"Have you not seen your brother?"	On their arrival at the chateau, the two families separated until dinner; but, in the presence of his wife sitting tranquilly beside the sleeping child, Georges Fromont, too young to be absorbed by the joys of domesticity, was continually thinking of the brilliant Sidonie, whose voice he could hear pouring forth triumphant roulades under the trees in the garden.	She preferred to go out alone.	The unlucky manager had eaten so many meals on credit at his restaurant that he dared not go there again.	For a whole week the actor had delved away at plans and figures, seated between his wife and daughter, who watched him in admiration, and intoxicated themselves with this latest dream.	I feel sure that all that's necessary is a little success to make him young and happy again.	He described Sidonie's conduct, her mad extravagance, the total wreck of the family honor.	But neither Pyramus nor Thisbe, not even Kiss, the formidable Newfoundland, had made a sign.	The two men, drinking in silence, lost their patience and fidgeted about on the bench, each hoping that the other would tire of waiting.	But he had tremendous success, no end of recalls.	And, despite his grief, he had almost a triumphant air.	It is a great pity.	I assure you.	"And such company!"	exclaimed M. Chebe, incensed at the thought of his son-in-law escaping him.	he has been foolish enough to send the father and mother away from their daughter; if anything happens to her, he can't blame us.	if your father could only succeed!"	But when the rain came and he could not go out, what misery!	It was a dangerous commission.	Only, if I go into broadcloths I must have a man to travel; for the best kinds come from Sedan and Elbeuf.	His terrified wife rose and timidly approached him, while Desiree half rose in her armchair with an expression of nervous agony that distorted all her features.	In addition to all these advantages, only a hedge separated this paradise from another "chalet with garden" of precisely the same description, occupied by Sigismond Planus the cashier, and his sister.	He recognized the map fastened to the wall by four pins, the window on the landing, and the Delobelles' little sign: 'Birds and Insects for Ornament.'	The old cashier, surrounded by his lieutenants, has a businesslike, awe-inspiring air.	Night was falling.	"And even suppose it were true," cried M. Chebe, furious at her persistence.	The mother was compelled to remain away, and it often happened that she was unable to go with Sidonie to meet the partners when they came from Paris at night.	From time to time Fromont Jeune, on the point of going out in his carriage, looks in for a moment, with a cigar in his mouth, neatly gloved and ready for the street.	it's Monsieur Frantz."	And to bed he would go, to his wife's great relief.	the barefooted children, the tiny creatures wrapped in old shawls, the shabby women, whose tear-stained faces were as white as the linen caps that surmounted them.	The account of stock is usually taken late in December, between Christmas and New Year's Day.	When he had composed his prospectus and made his estimates, he went to the factory to see Risler, who, being very busy, made an appointment to meet him in the Rue Blondel; and that same evening, Delobelle, being the first to arrive at the brewery, established himself at their old table, ordered a pitcher of beer and two glasses, and waited.	The actor displayed his figures.	He already fancied himself acting--for that was the main point--acting, in a theatre of his own, roles written expressly for him, to suit his talents, in which he would produce all the effect of-- Suddenly the door opened, and M. Chebe made his appearance amid the pipe- smoke.	here he is!"	He took the first omnibus that left the office in the morning, returned at dinner-time, and on Sundays remained at home, tending his flowers and his poultry.	Madame Chebe, a thorough Parisian, sighed for the narrow streets of the Marais, her expeditions to the market of Blancs- Manteaux, and to the shops of the quarter.	He had been detained at home; Sidonie had company--Delobelle touched M. Chebe's foot under the table-- and, as he spoke, the poor man, decidedly perplexed by the two empty glasses that awaited him, wondered in front of which of the two he ought to take his seat.	"Claire Fromont plays the piano; I will sing.	A veritable little iceberg, in very truth.	Having no social connections, she came gradually to make a friend of her singing-mistress.	And to a more direct suggestion, not daring to answer, "No," he took refuge behind such phrases as "I will see"--"Perhaps later"-- "I don't say no"--and finally uttered the unlucky words "I must see the estimates."	Only Sigismond, the old cashier, was really ill at ease.	The whole house hold was asleep.	The work-women laughed sneeringly and whispered: "Just look at that Tata Bebelle!	The blinds of the little house at the foot of the garden had been closed for two weeks.	Two or three times she heard some one near her whisper, "That is Madame Fromont Jeune," and, indeed, it was a simple matter for people to make the mistake, seeing the three return together from the station, Sidonie sitting beside Georges on the back seat, laughing and talking with him, and Risler facing them, smiling contentedly with his broad hands spread flat upon his knees, but evidently feeling a little out of place in that fine carriage.	To think that he used to live in the little room near hers, that they used to hear his step on the stairs and the noise made by his table when he dragged it to the window to draw!	As soon as that idea occurred to him, Sigismond Planus began to tremble seriously for his cash-box.	The end of the year, that is to say, the striking of the balance-sheet.	People stared at them a great deal.	The two women were waiting for him, working as usual, but with a sort of feverish activity which was strange to them.	--By the way, come and see me after the inventory.
