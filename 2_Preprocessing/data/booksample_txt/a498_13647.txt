Shall we try?	What was their horror on seeing the boat (including the churn and the tea-kettle) in the mouth of an enormous Seeze Pyder, an aquatic and ferocious creature truly dreadful to behold, and, happily, only met with in those excessive longitudes!	Ding-a-dong, ding-a-dong!	Nice little book!	When you scrape up the coals with a delicate sound,       You enrapture my life with delight,     Your nose is so shiny, your head is so round,       And your shape is so slender and bright!	II.	The names of all these places you have probably heard of; and you have only not to look in your geography-books to find out all about them.	E      [Illustration]     E was an eagle,     Who sat on the rocks,     And looked down on the fields     And the-far-away flocks.	[Illustration] CHAPTER VI.	And, having done this, they ate a light supper of brown-bread and Jerusalem artichokes, and took an affecting and formal leave of the whole of their acquaintance, which was very numerous and distinguished and select and responsible and ridiculous.	V.     "Let us both fly up to town:     There I'll buy you such a gown!	i!	CHAPTER XIV.	II.	Said the Broom, "And I'll sweep you away!"	And the seven young Fishes, swimming with great and uncomfortable velocity, plunged also into the mud quite against their will, and, not being accustomed to it, were all suffocated in a very short period.	X      [Illustration]     X was King Xerxes,     Who, more than all Turks, is     Renowned for his fashion     Of fury and passion.	No one stays out all night long     Without a hat: I'm sure it's wrong!"	Q      [Illustration]     Q was a quail     With a very short tail;     And he fed upon corn     In the evening and morn.	B      [Illustration]             b     B was once a little bear,         Beary,         Wary,         Hairy,         Beary,       Taky cary,       Little bear!	So they both to London went,     Alighting on the Monument;     Whence they flew down swiftly--pop!	Let us dine on beans and bacon."	F      [Illustration]     F was a fan     Made of beautiful stuff;     And when it was used,     It went puffy-puff-puff!	Said they, "We trust that cold or pain     We shall never feel again;     While, perched on tree or house or steeple,     We now shall look like other people.	"We are trying to make some worsted mittens, but do not know how."	Y      [Illustration]             y     Y was once a little yew,         Yewdy,         Fewdy,         Crudy,         Yewdy,     Growdy, grewdy,       Little yew!	Each of these blue bottles contained a Blue-Bottle-Fly; and all these interesting animals live continually together in the most copious and rural harmony: nor perhaps in many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found.	Far and few, far and few,         Are the lands where the Jumblies live:             Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         And they went to sea in a sieve.	in my head     Many thoughts of trouble come,     Like to flies upon a plum.	At which they all exclaimed,--    "Lettuce!	fairest of creatures, when sweeping the room,       Ah!	B      [Illustration]     B was a book     With a binding of blue,     And pictures and stories     For me and for you.	[Illustration: Pollybirdia Singularis.]	Crafty old cat!	"Can we be of any service to you, O crusty Crabbies?"	"O Timballoo!	"And," said the old Storks, "if you find a frog, divide it carefully into seven bits, but on no account quarrel about it."	They called aloud, "Our sieve ain't big;     But we don't care a button, we don't care a fig:         In a sieve we'll go to sea!"	Let us all of a sudden hop down from the table,         And hustle downstairs, and each jump on a horse!	a!	And they drank their health, and gave them a feast     Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast;     And every one said, "If we only live,     We, too, will go to sea in a sieve,         To the hills of the Chankly Bore."	O      [Illustration]     O was an orange     So yellow and round:     When it fell off the tree,     It fell down to the ground.	J      [Illustration]             j     J was once a jar of jam,         Jammy,         Mammy,         Clammy,         Jammy,       Sweety, swammy,         Jar of jam!	L      [Illustration]     L was a light     Which burned all the night,     And lighted the gloom     Of a very dark room.	Q      [Illustration]             q     Q was once a little quail,         Quaily,         Faily,         Daily,         Quaily,       Stumpy-taily,       Little quail!	D      [Illustration]             d     D was once a little doll,         Dolly,         Molly,         Polly,         Nolly,       Nursy dolly,       Little doll!	[Illustration] The next thing that happened to them was in a narrow part of the sea, which was so entirely full of fishes that the boat could go on no farther: so they remained there about six weeks, till they had eaten nearly all the fishes, which were soles, and all ready-cooked, and covered with shrimp-sauce, so that there was no trouble whatever.	THE NUTCRACKERS AND THE SUGAR-TONGS.	[Illustration: Bottlephorkia Spoonifolia.]	They said, "This is a dreadful thing!	Watch patiently till the crust begins to rise, and add a pinch of salt from time to time.	u!	VII.	And that was the end of the seven young Storks.	When they had landed, they walked about, but found, to their great surprise, that the island was quite full of veal-cutlets and chocolate-drops, and nothing else.	[Illustration] After sailing on calmly for several more days, they came to another country, where they were much pleased and surprised to see a countless multitude of white Mice with red eyes, all sitting in a great circle, slowly eating custard-pudding with the most satisfactory and polite demeanor.	And after this they filled the bottles with the ingredients for pickling, and each couple jumped into a separate bottle; by which effort, of course, they all died immediately, and became thoroughly pickled in a few minutes; having previously made their wills (by the assistance of the most eminent lawyers of the district), in which they left strict orders that the stoppers of the seven bottles should be carefully sealed up with the blue sealing-wax they had purchased; and that they themselves, in the bottles, should be presented to the principal museum of the city of Tosh, to be labelled with parchment or any other anti-congenial succedaneum, and to be placed on a marble table with silver-gilt legs, for the daily inspection and contemplation, and for the perpetual benefit, of the pusillanimous public.	"Our readers will be interested in the following communications from our valued and learned contributor, Prof. Bosh, whose labors in the fields of culinary and botanical science are so well known to all the world.	One never more can go to court,     Because his legs have grown too short;     The other cannot sing a song,     Because his legs have grown too long!"	When you have ascertained that the Amblongusses are quite soft, take them out, and place them in a wide pan, taking care to shake them well previously.	And as the few fishes who remained uneaten complained of the cold, as well as of the difficulty they had in getting any sleep on account of the extreme noise made by the arctic bears and the tropical turnspits, which frequented the neighborhood in great numbers, Violet most amiably knitted a small woollen frock for several of the fishes, and Slingsby administered some opium-drops to them; through which kindness they became quite warm, and slept soundly.	III.	And all night long, in the moonlight pale,     We sail away with a pea-green sail         In the shade of the mountains brown."	The seven young Cats set off on their travels with great delight and rapacity.	O      [Illustration]             o     O was once a little owl,         Owly,         Prowly,         Howly,         Owly,       Browny fowly,       Little owl!	And the old Cats said, "Be particularly careful not to meddle with a clangle-wangle if you should see one."	Poker he sate quite upright in the coach;       Mr. Tongs made a clatter and clash;     Miss Shovel was dressed all in black (with a brooch);       Mrs. Broom was in blue (with a sash).	[Illustration]                      IV.	Far and few, far and few,         Are the lands where the Jumblies live:             Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;         And they went to sea in a sieve.	T      [Illustration]     T was a tortoise,     All yellow and black:     He walked slowly away,     And he never came back.	And all night long they sailed away;         And when the sun went down,     They whistled and warbled a moony song         To the echoing sound of a coppery gong,     In the shade of the mountains brown.	The moment the Clangle-Wangle saw the seven young Cats approach, he ran away; and as he ran straight on for four months, and the Cats, though they continued to run, could never overtake him, they all gradually _died_ of fatigue and exhaustion, and never afterwards recovered.	The seven young Parrots had not gone far, when they saw a tree with a single cherry on it, which the oldest Parrot picked instantly; but the other six, being extremely hungry, tried to get it also.	BUT when the two old Parrots,      and the two old Storks,      and the two old Geese,      and the two old Owls,      and the two old Guinea Pigs,      and the two old Cats,      and the two old Fishes, became aware, by reading in the newspapers, of the calamitous extinction of the whole of their families, they refused all further sustenance; and, sending out to various shops, they purchased great quantities of Cayenne pepper and brandy and vinegar and blue sealing-wax, besides seven immense glass bottles with air-tight stoppers.	TO MAKE GOSKY PATTIES.	So all the children of each family thanked their parents; and, making in all forty-nine polite bows, they went into the wide world.	II.	Said the Shovel, "I'll certainly hit you a bang!"	n!	The Geese, having webs to their feet, caught quantities of flies, which they ate for dinner.	Naughty fat rabbit!
