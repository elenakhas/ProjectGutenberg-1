Surrounding the Dome was a living, writhing belt of giant worms.	"Yeah.	Thanks real lots."	Come in, Postal Ship."	He grinned.	Thanks.	They weren't supposed to need them.	Anything to--        *       *       *       *       * "_Pirates!	Preston yelled helplessly--but it was too late.	He picked off the location of the pirate ships--there were two of them, coming up out of the asteroid belt.	"They're about thirty feet long, a foot wide, and mostly mouth.	Preston reached for the wide-beam stud, pressed it.	Watch me carefully, and jump to it when you see me land.	Preston watched as the tactic got under way.	Mellors asked.	Finally: "Hello, Mail Ship?"	It was near midnight, and the sky over Nome Spaceport was bright with stars.	Come in, now!"	The ship roared down, jets blasting.	His scratch-pad began to fill with notations.	"The local native life," the colonist explained.	"Okay, I pick up your signal, Ganymede.	Gunderson asked incredulously.	"The one and only," Preston said.	He had computed exactly how much spare fuel he had, how much he could afford to waste.	Gunderson's ship traveled in a long, looping spiral that drew the pirate into the upper quadrant of space.	He centered the ship as well as he could on the Dome below and threw it into automatic pilot.	"You can't believe your ears.	He turned to the radio.	Preston closed his eyes for a second, trying to think things out.	"Seven miles," the colonist said.	They were silent for a few moments, as the three ships--two armed, one loaded with mail for Ganymede--streaked outward away from Earth.	He took the ship out in space, saw the blackness in the viewplate.	"Okay, I've got them.	Its outer wall opened and the fuel-tank went tumbling outward and down.	He pushed his way past the man in Space Grays and shouldered past a couple of barflies as he left.	"Just lovely."	He blasted loose from the tight orbit and rocked the ship down on manual.	And the mindless iceworms came, marching toward the fire, being consumed, as still others devoured the bodies of the dead and dying.	"Ganymede Colony?	"Why don't you ask the Chief that?	Anything to keep from having to talk to his two ex-Patrolmates or from having to think about the humiliating job he was on.	As his ship swung around the moon's poles in its tight orbit, he began to figure some fuel computations.	Preston didn't answer.	We've only been here two years, you know.	Shimmering gently amid the whiteness was the transparent yellow of the Dome beneath whose curved walls lived the Ganymede Colony.	Arms grabbed him, pulled him through.	One of the worms came by and chewed the antenna right off.	"But you can't come down!	"Okay, Ganymede," he radioed.	Seven miles of iceworms, eh?	Even at this distance, he could see five or six bright pips surrounding the huge planet.	He broke contact and scribbled some more figures.	_But I'm not going back.	"I can get there myself.	Preston smashed his hand against the control panel.	You're the first one who's been this close since it happened."	The forbidding surface of Ganymede grew closer and closer.	Small, deadly, compact, they orbited toward him.	How will you leave your ship?"	"Yeah?"	There was a pause, and then the figures started coming over.	"Please acknowledge," Mellors said.	Beams ripped into the hull of Mellors' ship, and a dark fissure line opened down the side of the ship.	This is your Postal Ship."	Now sit tight and wait."	"Screens took the charge."	"Where are you, Postal Ship?"	"You've got clearance."	All we've got left is this short-range thing we're using and it's no good more than ten thousand miles from here.	_Slight difference_, Preston thought, as he set up his blasting pattern.	Down below, he could see the blue-white ammonia ice that was the frozen atmosphere of Ganymede.	The radio crackled.	There was Callisto, and--ah--there was Ganymede.	Preston gripped his controls and threw the ship into a plunging dive that dropped it back behind the protection of both Patrol ships.	In its own way, this was as dangerous, perhaps even more so.	Mellors!	"We'll take care of them for you."	There they were--waiting.	Preston snapped on the radio.	"Check."	He'd have to try a different tactic.	Come on--I'll walk you over to Administration."
